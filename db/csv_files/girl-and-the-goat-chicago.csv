Girl & the Goat
"I went there for a birthday thing and because our Chicago home-girl Top Chef Stephanie is the owner/chef. Not only was the food amazing, but we sat next to another Iron Chef- I think from Japan? A little unexpected treat for us ladies who love any show with the word ""chef"" in it. I don't go to fancy restaurants often but I'm so glad I got a chance to eat here. Awesome restaurant."
"This is a must eat if you're visiting Chicago!! This was my favorite restaurant out of all the places I tried in Chicago, and I really wish there was one in LA. This is another restaurant where the wait is ridiculously long so make sure to make a reservation months in advance. I tried to make one about 4-6 weeks in advance, but the date/time I wanted wasn't available so we just decided to go there anyways and see what we can do. The wait for the table was like at least 2 hours so we decided to wait for the bar seating which is open seating (but we put our name down on the waiting list too). We waited about 40 minutes and was finally seated at the lounge area.We ordered the hamachi with pork belly, cooked oysters (raw was n/a), their infamous pig face, and the roasted cauliflower. I give everything 5/5 as it was spectacular (including presentation) with extremely unique and flavorful taste! The servers were also on point with the frequent refills of water without even having to call for them, even when we sat in the lounge area and not the table area. Surprisingly, my favorite was their cauliflower which was roasted with pine nuts, picked peppers, mint, and chili aioli. It tasted like a baked potato with all these flavorings and even my boyfriend, who at first did not want to order the cauliflower, said this was his favorite dish as well. ORDER THE CAULIFLOWER!! :)"
"After hearing so much hype about this restaurant, my friends and I had it at the top of our list of places to check out. The only problem is that snagging a reservation at a reasonable time is damn near impossible. We ended up booking 2 months in advance and still had to settle for a 9PM Sunday night time slot haha. By the time it was the weekend we were going, I actually completely forgot we even made the reservation.All this advanced planning was just building up some massive expectations for the food. But I gotta say that Stephanie Izard and team totally delivered. It was easily one of my favorite meals I've had in Chicago so far. For as hot of a restaurant this is, I actually thought the prices were pretty reasonable. Our group ordered a ton of stuff and got to try a little bit of everything, and it was still cheaper than a steak at Gibsons.Food: I wasn't about to make 9PM Sunday dinners a habit, so we made it a point to order everything in sight as if there wouldn't be a next time. Luckily we had a big enough group to even try the massive goat leg too. Chickpea fritter - A really tasty deep fried ball of hummus basically. Crispy on the outside, and smooth and creamy in the inside.Sauteed greeen beans - Even though I generally don't like fish, I ironically love the taste of fish sauce for some reason (probably because of Filipino patis), so I enjoyed the salty vinaigrette in this dish.Roasted cauliflower - They must be doing something right if I actually enjoyed eating veggies. Solid side.Hamachi crudo - I just saw the words crispy pork belly on the menu and automatically ordered this. I didn't even realize it was a fish dish. I'm not the biggest seafood fan so it was far from my favorite bite.Escargot ravioli - You couldve filled those suckers with anything and I still would've eaten it. The pasta was thin and fresh, and that sauce that was coating the ravioli was delicious. I just wish there was more. Goat empanada - It pained me to split the empanada into thirds because it was so good. I could've eaten a ton of these. Crunchy and flaky crust with a juicy, meaty filling. Ham frites - Eh. They were tasty but nothing more than fries with some sort of ham flavored dust on top. The dipping sauces were pretty money though. Pig face - I had really high expectations because everyone I talked to and all the reviews I read were raving so much about it. Again, it was tasty but nothing mind blowing. Maybe I don't appreciate jowl meat as much as I should, but when you mash it all together, it tastes like a regular breakfast dish to me. It was like a gourmet version of bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns. Pork shank - THAT ORANGE SAUCE. What is it?? I still have no clue, but I could literally drink it. There was nothing better throughout that entire meal than dipping pieces of naan in whatever sauce that was. The meat on the pork shank was amazing as well. Nicely crisped outside followed by succulent and fatty meat that fell off the bone. Hands down best dish of the night. I'll order this again and again. Goat leg - We honestly ordered this mostly for the experience. We had enough people so why the hell not. They brought out a huge board with a big goat leg surrounded by a bunch of different sauces. It also came with some crispy onions and a whole basket of naan. The meat was super tender. In fact, we literally pulled the bone out clean with no effort. Maybe I just like the taste of pork better than goat, but in retrospect I would definitely just order multiple pork shanks next time instead of this. Worth it to try once though.Overall, gatg is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the city. I'm not the most adventurous eater, so their ability to make me enjoy unique ingredients I wouldn't usually eat is a win. Everything tasted great...Really good contemporary tapas without the absurd fine dining prices."
"Girl & the Goat is another must try in Chicago! The Purple Pig ever so SLIGHTLY edges out Girl & the Goat but both are delicious. We came to Girl & the Goat after an amazing lunch at The Purple Pig so my tastebuds may have very well been biased. In order of deliciousness: *Sauteed Green Beans (Fish Sauce Vinaigrette. Cashews): This was a little bit on the salty side but the flavors were magical - the savoriness of the fish sauce + the rich cashew + fresh green beans...YES. I also love fish sauce + veggies (RIP Red Medicine). *Wood Grilled Broccoli (Rogue Smokey Beu, Spiced Crispies): There's cereal in my broccoli?! YES. The broccoli was so wonderfully smoky from being wood grilled. Again, a little on the salty side but still tasty nonetheless *Copper River Sockeye Salmon (Yellow tomato, vanilla bean yogurt, Sungold Salad, Spiced Peanuts): I really enjoyed how fresh this dish was. Beautiful colors with the tomato and cucumbers. Really well cooked Salmon. Why would one order Salmon at Girl & The Goat? When one is too pork'ed about from The Purple Pig. *Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix): I know this is THE thing to get here, so how come it's so low on my list? In my head, I imagined canto-style BBQ with an ACTUAL Pig's Face but of course, that's not appetizing is it? Haha. *Escargot Ravioli (bacon. tamarind-miso sauce): The idea of Escargot freaks me out but figured that this was as good a time as any to try it. The ravioli was a little too mushy for my liking but, the sauce was divine. *Goat Empanadas (Smoked Blueberry Tapenade. Avocado): This isn't exactly something I'd eat a lot of BUT I think it's a must try here. I didn't love the whole blueberries but weren't very incorporated in the dish itself. Props for a non-gamey goat though! anddd can't complain about the execution of the empanada itself Parked on the street (metered) or there's valet."
"Ehh, this place is over hyped. We weren't able to make a reservation the week before but we came really early (at 5pm) for dinner on a Friday evening and was able to get a seat. Yay! Seems like you need to make reservation one month in advance in order to get a seat. We had a 2 hour dinner limit. Our server was friendly and helpful. You're suppose to order 2-3 dishes for each person. The portions are like tapas style Â and to be shared family style. We ordered around 10 items. I don't remember everything we had but I felt half of the dishes we ordered were pretty salty. I did not really have a favorite dish, either. The price tag is up there, though. Overall just an okay restaurant for me. My co-worker from UK wanted to try this place out since it's so popular and that was the reason we came."
"I don't have too many words because everything was mouth watering and decadent.My roommate and I went here on a whim with way too many options in mind...the waiter actually told us to order less because we were overly ambitious and wanted to try everything. We started off with the multigrain bread with spring onion cream cheese. Obviously filled our stomach because the cream cheese was delicious. Next, the kohlrabi salad came out... it was SO fresh and delicious with hints of basil. Definitely recommend if you're looking to start out your meal with a salad.Next, my roommate and I's entrees came out. She ordered the crisp braised pork shank and pan roasted halibut and was basically swimming in deliciousness for an hour. I devoured the spring onion pierogies. They were soft and potatoey and mouth watering. Granted, I was STUFFED but I still ate 3/4 of what was on my plate.Finally, our waiter brought out small samplers of dessert. I definitely recommend the budino always and forever. The blackberry shortcake was nothing compared to the budino.We would come here every week if we could... obviously reservations should be made months in advance. We came here because we found a random opening. Definitely recommend with flying colors for vegetarians! Oftentimes, classy American restaurants like this just serve veggies with some random sauces, but Girl & the Goat amazed me throughout every dish that was brought out."
"If you can get reservations here and you're from out of town... do it. So glad we were able to. My friends and I actually booked at least 2 months in advance and were successful! On the day of our dinner... We had to push our dinner back an hour or 2 due to our tourist schedule; we were still good to go! Inside - looks pretty cool. Busy and quite nice. I like the whole set up. Service - Very good. Our server was attentive & food came out at a good pace. As for the reservations part - we sat near the front, so I heard a lot of people coming in and some didn't have rezzies. Most of them sat at the bar waiting for a table to open up. That could be an option for you. I personally don't like waiting over an hour for a table. Food -- our server said 2 per person would be filling enough. But really... it depends on what you order. My friends and I were kind of mislead on portions wise. Haha. Oh well. More food is better than less food. My favorite dishes...Crispy Braised Pork Shank - This is entree sized. I thought it was smaller, but when it came out....My eyes were bigger than my stomach. The meat was so good - done just the way I like it. Especially with the sauces & Naan bread. They do include some sort of Mango Kimchi. I don't like fusion Kimchi, so I barely at it, but my friends had it and enjoyed it. I'm drooling just thinking about this dish... YUM. I highly recommend this item, especially if your table wants to do a ""share each dish"" kind of thing!Goat Liver Mousse - The bread/mini biscuit came out warm and smelled enticing. The taste of the bread was super good. Imagine a super good piece of bread along with Mousse, Jam, and some sort of Pickled Veggies. AHHH. Melted in my mouth. This dish was pretty big. Definitely shareable. But if one was only wanting this dish and nothing else, go at it. Grilled Octopus & Spicy Chili Crab - if you like seafood and you like grilled items. I'd get these. Both dishes had bold and strong flavors and they were given in generous portions. The rice in the Spicy Chili Crab absorbed all the ingredients and was delicious. Grilled Octopus was done perfectly. Some places kind of fail at grilling this usually, but not G&TG! MMMM. ^ I should note... I rarely eat seafood. So... my taste buds are different. Duck Tongues - I kind of thought this tasted like Chicken. I've never had Duck Tongue till now. So... not an expert. Even though to me the name is weird, I still enjoyed the dish. I actually used the sauces included in my Crispy Braised Pork Shank to give it more of a zing. 5/5!"
"Worth trying at least once or twice, if you can get a reservation (which is usually months in advance) or if you get lucky on a day-of cancellation. Recommendations for dinner: Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face, Crisp Braised Pork Shank, Hamachi Crudo, Steamed Cape Cod Mussels, Pan Fried Shishito Peppers, Roasted Beets, and Confit Goat Belly. MUST try the PB&J dessert, will leave you wanting so much more."
"First things first, make sure you book in advance -- as soon as you know you're headed to Chicago and want to dine here. I booked probably 2 months ahead, and got a time near their dinner opening on Friday night. At around 4:15 (opening time is 4:30), I saw that they already had people lined up outside who were hoping to get seats without having a reservation. It looked like they were successful, so if you don't have a reservation, I recommend you go during non-peak hours for sure. The food was awesome. I love how they crafted their menu items to be moderately-sized dishes (for the most part) that you share with the rest of your group. This lets you sample quite a few things on their menu. Our waiter told us to not forget the veggies, as their veggie dishes are really excellent. We tried to get the chickpea fritters, Â it were told that the tasting of that dish that happened at 4 pm before the restaurant opened pushed the timing of the dish back such that it wouldn't be ready until 9 pm that evening, or perhaps not at all. I thought that was a pretty good move for the restaurant, not wanting to serve a dish that they didn't think was perfect. We ended up getting the roasted cauliflower -- and whoa, I have never been impressed with cauliflower before in my life until that dish came out! We heard good things about the wood oven roasted pig face, which ended up being pretty good, although very heavy. I would have liked a little more of the tamarind or perhaps something more citrus-y to cut through the heaviness. Although the dish was not large, I felt very full even just after a few bites. Our waiter came by and mixed the dish up for us when he say they we weren't doing so enough, which was also nice. Finally, we got the goat neck, which we were told ahead of time was a large dish so we didn't need to order much more after that. That was definitely a correct statement -- I never though goat necks were that big! But it was a really good part of the goat which I had not tried before. The meat was super tender, and just came right off with your fork. They prepare the near over a multi-day period and it comes out super rich, a little smokey, but not at all dry. The flavor is excellent, and the sauces paired with it are awesome as well. The vegetables on the bottom kind of got lost with the huge goat neck on top of it, and I would have liked a few more veggies in general. We ended up having to take some goat neck back home with us, and we left with several suggestions from our waiter about awesome goat neck leftover dishes. Overall, an excellent experience. It seems like their menu changes pretty frequently, because a lot of the dishes mentioned in other posts were not on the menu when we were there. So, it looks like they have good variety in general and do a good job with all of their dishes. I will be back :)"
"This place had reservations 1 month out in advance and the only way to eat here was to come early and wait for a table. We show up 15 minutes before it opened and there was already a line! But right when they opened we were seated right away given the promise that we would give back the table in an hour and a half for reservations. Our server was amazing, knew every ingredient in everything that we wanted. We ended up getting the octopus and it is the second best octopus we have had only second to Hawaii! We then got the pig face and the goat leg and we were done! It was so good and juicy that we wobble out of the restaurant. So glad we got the privilege to try this Â busy restaurant."
"On my trip to Chicago, I knew I had to go to Girl & the Goat. It's a very popular spot, and you need to make reservations ahead of time. I stopped by on a Monday night, and it was packed. I ordered the wood roasted pig face, braised pork shank and escargot ravioli. My favorite of the night was the pig face. It comes out with an egg on top, and you mix everything together. It was very crispy and all the favors blended perfectly together. My bf loved the braised pork shank. It was fall of the bone, juicy and tender. The escargot ravioli was cooked al dente, though I couldn't taste too much of the escargot. For dessert, we ordered the chocolate truffle cake and the waitress brought us the miso-butterscotch budino because it was our anniversary. Both desserts were amazing!!I highly recommend them! P.S. Service is exceptional here! I really liked our waitress, I forgot her name but she was amazing and very personal."
"This place is so popular, the only time I could get a reservation for my table of 5 was 11pm on a Saturday night. Booked a month in advance too! However, I gotta say based on my experience.. it was worth it!! Here is what my table ordered:- Bean sprout, was okay. Sauce was good and it went nicely with the other dishes.- Beef tongue, so tender and yummy! - Pig face, had an egg on top that you mix together. It was good and easily shareable. - Soft shell crab, surprisingly tasty, soft and crispy! - Baby octopus, the only dish I didn't love. Way too salty for me. - Goat belly, my pick and it was awesome! Never had goat belly but I loved it.- Ended my order with their Ruby don't love me drink. Light and sweet. Someone from my table also wanted the pork shank dish but heard it was out. However, towards the end our nice server Alex came out with the dish saying they didn't want to disappoint and it was on the house! This dish was pretty substantial, the pork was tender and falls off the bone. Overall, I had a great time. My favs would be beef tongue, soft shell crab and goat belly. If I came to Chicago again, I would probably try more goat dishes and the fish (which I heard is good too). Would definitely recommend this place as one not to miss!"
"Pretty exceptional! Having known about this place for the past month or so I booked early because this is one of the most sought after restaurants to eat at. With 3986 reviews how do you pass this up?! I think this is the most reviews I've seen on Yelp history! Taking a quick look at the menu a few items like the pig face and beef tongue may scare ordinary eaters away! But with good persuasion and open minds you could lure your guests and friends to this eatery! Â Per the server's suggestion she recommended sharing 6 to 8 plates like family style for a table of four. Bread. Oysters. Goats. Veggie. Fish. Meat. Dessert. Bread: yo quiero taco bread. Nom mom nom!! A cute little mound of orange-colored possibly tomato bread sliced. Side of cheddar onion dip and pico de gallo. Ate it too fast to realize the taste of the actual bread. The combination of the sides on the bread created a wonderful appetizer. $4Oysters: Wood Fired. 4 oysters with some white sauce and cooked over a well... Wood fire! If you're not into the texture of the food, the oyster might not be for you. $12Goats: failed to order something from this section. Boo hoo. The items are quite interesting too! V:-pan fried shishito peppers. Served in a bowl with melted Parmesan on top and sprinkled sesame seeds and a miso glaze. Peppers are with stems that are easily broken off and filled with edible seeds. A slight hint of spice. Good dish. $9-wood grilled broccoli. A high stack of broccoli on top of the rogue smokey bleu cheese and spiced crispies. In a simple matter this is the fancy adult version of broccoli and cheese. Simple dish. $10F: pan roasted halibut with marcona almond butter on top and pieces of white asparagus underneath with a blueberry nuoc cham to cover. Portion was about a 2x2 measurement. Buttery soft and delicious. The almond butter stood out as a complementing flavor. $19M: -grilled marinated pork belly. castelfranco (which is a pale yellow-green leafy vegetable) with green sauce and blackberries. These were thin slices of pork that didn't resemble the pork belly and fat that I'm used to. $15-sugo. canestri pasta with a meat mixture of beef, pork and lamb with baby carrots and cape gooseberries. An enjoyable wholesome pasta dish. $15-wood oven roasted pig face. Soft pieces of pork face with a sunny side egg on top and sprinkled tamarind and cilantro. red wine-maple was decorated along with potato stix. I would say this is a flavorful dish that a meat lover would devour. $18-braised beef tongue. Thin slices of beef tongue and a crispy skin-like layers of something matched the tongue. Almost tasted like crispy duck skin. Could have been a rendition of masa (dough flour or the outside of a tamale) beef vinaigrette and salsa verde were mixed within the entree. A favorite dish of the night! $15Desserts: beyond full to even enjoy a dessert. The one incident that was odd was that the server didn't recognize anything about a special benefit via Lexus. If you show your key fob supposedly you were supposed to receive a nice surprise from the kitchen. However, the server did not know anything about it! Bummer!Ending thoughts: I'm glad I experienced unique tastes for one of the most popular restaurants in the city. Great food selection. One thing you'll notice is the giant girl and the goat wall painting. A little on the dark side. Looking forward to dining here again."
"We came here on a Thursday night at 5:45. Â It started to rain about 15 minutes prior to our arrival. Â We had no reservations and didn't have to wait with a party of 4, lucky us. Â It is quite a hippy type of place. Â Tapas seems to be the thing these days, great way to try a variety of dishes. Â We had 9 orders, and 2 desserts. Â I can only comment on the items I can eat, Â Soft shell 'chili crab' strawberry, crab rice - the soft shell crab was amazing, fried perfectly with plenty of flavor and quite sweet since soft shell crabs are in season, I just didn't think the strawberry, crab rice was the right combination, the rice tasted very vinegar. Â Pan roasted halibut with Marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry Nuoc Cham - the halibut tasted very tender and not fishy, the top of the halibut was crispy given it a different type of texture. Â Grilled baby octopus with guanciale, fava beans, pea tips, pistachios, lemon vinaigrette - the octopus was also quite good, tender and not chewy but a little on the salty side. Breadstick buns - these were garlic type buns, they were very tiny and cost a lot. Chocolate truffle cake with just the right amound of coconut - this was very sweet and delicious, I love the coconut combination, presentation was beautiful, ice cream surround by chocolate cake. Â Blackberry shortcake with Thai basil, lime and almond - this was just plain and simple, nothing special. Â Service was quite good. Â The average tapas was about $16, the portions are not that big. Â For the price, I expected a little more. Â I don't know if this is worth an hour or more wait, I encourage you to make reservations. Â You can sit at the bar or the lounge if you don't really need to sit at a table. Â It is a decent place but a little on the noisy end, so not sure if it's a good date place. Â Nonetheless a place with 4000+ reviews and 4.5 stars is quite impressive to me. Â Two of my friends recommended it to me and I decided to give it a try. Â If the line gets too long, there are many highly recommended restaurants nearby."
"Just a quick update from my previous review. Honestly, everything I've had there I would have again. This time, we had shisido peppers, pierogies, crab Rangoon, halibut, something raw I can't remember, and chick pea fritters. We were still hungry by the last course, so we decided to order all three of the breads, which weren't too pricey, and we enjoyed the mall-the buns with a tomatoey sauce were generally agreed to be the best. The Rangoon was the least exciting, not a ton of flavor really just fried, so it wasn't bad, but nothing to write home about. We got the berry short bread for dessert. The butterscotch thing was better, much more interesting and flavorful, but the shortcake was very good for a short cake dish, and they did a lot with it-fresh berries, cream, almonds for a much more interesting texture, and some berry sorbet or ice cream.Like last time, I'd say the drinks were the least exciting part of the meal. They were Alright just not super interesting or flavorful. The great fruity one was sort of watery. Again, the service was excellent, they were totally on top of water refills and play changes. They also never seem to rush people, and a meal there naturally ends up being about 2 1/2 hours, which is really nice for having dinner with friends. Oh, and we sat outside this time, it was the perfect night for it, and everyone was very solicitous about our comfort with respect to the heat lamp."
"I don't think I can ever eat normal food again. We are visiting Chicago and my son picked out this restaurant. We ordered the multigrain bread ($4), roasted cauliflower ($9), calamari bruschetta($16), oven wood roasted pig face ($18), and miso-butterscotch budino dessert ($9).All the dishes came separately but very, very quickly. We never finished one dish before the next one came out. All four dishes came within 8-10 minutes. Multigrain bread came with sour cream cheese with chives and rhubarb spread with mint. It was amazing! Not a big serving but a good deal for $4. Oven roasted pig face came with a sunny side up egg over it and some sweet/tangy sauces. It was a crispy on the outside but chewy and soft on the inside - probably the best dish of the night. Calamari bruschetta came at a close second. Sturdy pieces of bread were soaked in sauce and topped with herbs, veggies, and delicious calamari. 4 small pieces were included in the dish.Roasted cauliflower was also delicious. The pine nuts are an important addition to give you a good crunch. The miso-butterscotch budino was nicely done with toffee bacon and cashews. The miso flavor isn't strong, but the saltiness stands out to compliment the sweetness of the rest of the ingredients. A great way to end the night. If you're visiting Chicago it's a place you have to try."
"Five (5) stars and beyond for every food item.THE AMBIANCE:Girl and the Goat (""GG"") is an upscale restaurant and bar. There is wood, brick, beautiful lighting, and interesting decorations. In terms of the look of the place, if you're from San Diego think Craft and Commerce but a larger space and bougie. If you're from Los Angeles think The Stocking Frame + the upscale feel of Perch.THE FOOD:Wow. Wow. Wow. I am in LOVE with GG's food. It was a group of four (4) of us and we tried a lot of things on the menu. The menu is split into vegetables, fish, meat, bread, oysters, goats, and desserts. The food is tapa-style and our waitress recommended getting a good amount of plates to share.Here is the list of what we tried and my thoughts:1. Wood Grilled Broccoli: rogue smokey bleu cheese. spiced crispies.Even the non-brocolli eaters at the table could not get enough of this smokey and creamy treat. The broccoli was perfectly cooked - soft but also dense - and what made me smile were the rice crispies. So random but so perfect.2. Hamachi Crudo: crisp pork belly. chili aioli. caperberries.Very light and refreshing. The hamachi was topped with crispy flakes, there were small slices of jalapeÃ±os and pineapple, and it also came with pieces of juicy pork.3. Ham Frites: smoked tomato aioli. cheddar beer sauce.This platter is fries dusted in bacon with the sides of sauce noted above.4. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple. potato stix.The pig face was roasted to perfection. It was semi-fatty and caramelized. The yolk oozed onto the meat and created creaminess. I loved this!5. Braised Beef Tongue: masa. beef vinaigrette. salsa verde.GG is very generous with the beef tongue in this dish. They fry the masa into a crispy chip and the rest of the plate is garnish and greens. the beef tongue was very tender.6. Goat Empanadas: smoked blueberry tapenade. avocado.I really enjoyed the empanadas because they were the right amount of crispy and dense. The empanadas came atop a bed of mashed avocado and were sprinkled with cheese. The chef throws some soft cherries on top. The cherries are more juicy than sweet.7. Confit Goat Belly: bourbon butter. lobster n' crab. fennel.The goat belly reminded me of the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (""PF"") but the PF had a caramelized taste. This dish is a surf and turf option and comes upon a bed of what tasted to me like a smooth mashed potato but I could be wrong. Whatever it was, it was yummy.8. Horchata Rice Pudding: rhubarb semifreddo. cinnamon toast crunch.Putting my I'm Mexican -I love horchata - I love arroz con leche - bias aside, I can honestly say this is the BEST dessert I have ever had in my LIFE. Rhubarb? Really? YES! What an odd mix of texture and flavor and what a fabulous explosion of deliciousness in my mouth. This cold horchata ball (semifreddo - semi-frozen dessert) that won't melt sits atop a warm rice pudding. On the side they place the rhubarb, which is crunchy and tart, and then on top of it all goes their homemade cinnamon toast crunch in pieces and two big chips at the top. It was ridiculous! You have to try this!!THE TIPS:Don't think about coming here - Do it! Â Try everything."
"We had our reservation at 10:45 pm. We were sit right after we arrived. We were sit right at the kitchen window, which is super awesome as we can see all the cooks cooking! And it is REALLY COOL!!!!!!The servers were wonderful! Our server is very enthusiastic about her job and is very knowledgable about the menu as well. After she learnt that this is our first time at Girl and a Goat, she explained the menu to us very thoroughly! We were told we should order 4-5 dishes to share for a party of 2. We ordered the pig face, the goat belly, the halibut and the beef rib. We wanted to order the scallop as well but after the first four dishes she immediately told us that it might be too much for us as the dishes we ordered are all the heavy side. First, the halibut is to die for. The flavor is so interesting and complicate! You have to try it!Second, the pig face!!! This is probably the most-famous dish here! It is indeed on the heavy side, but it is really good! The meat is juicy and tender, it is a nice touch to have a sunny side up egg paired with it!The goat belly was paired with lobster and crab, and braised in lemon-flavored purÃ©e like thing..It is just wonderful.The beef rib was a little bit too salty for me...Plus, for some reason, we got a cauliflower for free and it is just delicious!!!Very very good experience here! Will be back!!"
"My first review since moving to Chicago, and it sets a pretty high bar for my future food expeditions! I've eaten here during previous visits and I must say the food seems even better than before. The flavors are fantastic and the atmosphere is great, albeit a bit loud. There are so many reviews already so I won't add much except to say I definitely appreciate the Vietnamese undertones of several dishes on the menu. I will mention we asked for mini portions of some veggie dishes and our server acted like he didn't know what we were talking about...but ended up getting them for us anyways. The portions were perfect for the two of us so I'll forgive that awkwardness. Pig face. Get this. Halibut. Get this. Butterscotch Budino. You MUST get this. Make reservations well in advance unless you like waiting or can sneak into a bar seat."
"Girl and the goat was one of the highlights of a fantastic trip to Chicago!!! From the cocktails to the food to the service, everything, and I mean everything, was 5 stars for me! Make reservations, like yesterday, and you can message me and thank me later! :)We ordered; - duck tongue- fries- octopus- halibut- pig face - roasted cauliflowerIt was my first time having duck tongue and all I can say is, WOW!!! Who would have EVER thunk that duck tongue and raw tuna would go so well together?? Well, it does! It is perfect in every bite. The duck tongue was a little salty but the raw tuna evened it out so well. The fries were good, too! They came with a side of two different sauces; one that was a cheese sauce and the other, not sure what it was other than amazing. Octopus was also delicious, halibut was flaky and perfectly cooked. Pig face was exactly what I expected it to be.. Fatty and succulent. It also came with a fat egg on top so u mix the two together and there you'll have the most amazing pig face you'll ever touch base with. Roasted cauliflower was perfectly seasoned and had the perfect bite to it! I also ordered a Manhattan cocktail and an old fashioned. Both were top notch.Service is something to definitely write home about. In between these plates we ordered, our servers made sure we always had clean plates! They would switch em out with every 2-3 new food plates they brought out to ensure the flavors of each plate didn't mix. Our waters were never even close to empty and with every crumb, our server made sure he wiped that off asap! I was so impressed by the food, the decor, the service, everything!!!! So impressed, I would have to admit that this is the best dining experience I've had in a LONG time! I mean talk about impressed from the minute we stepped in to the minute we stepped out! It's been 2 days since I've been back home in dallas from Chicago and I'm still raving about girl & the goat!"
"Review Number 100, it's supposed to big a momentous occasion, and I've chosen a restaurant that I have yet to hear any bad things about. Â Girl & the Goat comes highly recommended, the food and service are great, Stephanie Izard is a wizard in the kitchen, yep great things. This has not been my experience. Â I'd like to think it was just a one-of, but have been multiple times and the food was not better the second or third time around. Â I've had to send food back because it was unpalatable, over-reduced and extremely salty (the kitchen was taken aback, as if such a thing was impossible...)Dishes I have enjoyed: sauteed green beans and roasted cauliflowerOther dishes I did not: goat confit, pork stew, goat loin, loup de mer, pig face, goat empanada, sugoYou'll notice a pattern here, the side dishes were very delightful, but the main courses were not. Â Many people have described the food as artisan, and I would agree. Â The spices are unique, but used heavily. Â When the base is a piece of meat, which has great innate flavor, and you add lots of spice, then it becomes too much. Â But with veggies like green beans or cauliflower, the flavor comes from the spices, and the dish is well balanced. Â Perhaps I ought to be a vegetarian for a night, at a place with goat in the name no less. Â But at the end of the day, if you are going to spend $$$ per person then it better be delicious, and Girl & the Goat did not meet that high bar."
"I think this is the yelpiest restaurant in Chicago. Luckily I was able to squeeze it in when I realized it was only open for dinner. It opens at 4:30 and knowing how this place is super poppin, there will already be a line when it opens. We got there around 4:25 and those hosts really know wassup. They remembered our group and said that we would be seated but would have to leave by 6-6:30 for reservations. The bar seating is first come first serve but since we had a group of six, we had to get seats and luckily we got eeeet. There is a pretty decent sized waiting area that was crowded when we arrived. You dont put your name down either. We had this goat item and funny thing is I dont like game haha. Derp1) Chickpea Fritter- Yeah I wasnt feeling it. It tasted too potato-y carby so I wouldnt get it. 2) Green Beans- These were good. You always need some greens in your meal3) Pig Face- This is the famous one. The meat was tender and nice and having that yolk explode always adds a nice touch4) Pork Shank- Even though we got the pig face, we ordered the pork shank for mo. The crispy parts on the outside are always the best.5) Escargot Ravioli- This was my first time trying escargot and I have to say this isnt something I would ever crave. Maybe if you are into it, then this is the place to go6) Roasted Cauliflower- yummy."
"Fantastic meal and experience! Â I made our reservation months in advance, so we'd been looking forward to eating here for some time. Â From the moment we walked in to the moment we left, everything was exceptional! Â We sat on the end of a row of half booth/half chair seats, so we technically had three seats at our table. Â I didn't notice the noise that so many people have referenced, but that may be because we only had one table next to us. Â Service was prompt and excellent. Â I'd say it was some of the best service I've ever received at a restaurant. Â We started with drinks, one of which was recommended by our server. Â They offer shared plates and our server recommended two plates per person. Â We ordered the sauteed green beans, pan roasted halibut, the roasted pig face, and the goat empanadas. Â Everything was so delicious! Â Very strong and rich flavors. Â I'd have to say my favorite of the dishes we tried was the halibut with the empanadas right behind. Â For dessert we had the chocolate truffle cake. Â I'm not a big fan of coconut, so I was a little concerned I wouldn't like it, but it truly was just the right amount. Â My only complaint of our experience was we waited a little long for my boyfriend's second drink, but other than that we really enjoyed our meal. Â I'd say it's one of the best meals I've had in Chicago."
"Girl & and the Goat sure knows how to deliver good meat! Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered the goat liver patÃª, goat shank, and the famous pig face:Goat liver patÃª - it came with a jar of caramelized patÃª along with ramekins of blueberry puree, rhubarb, diced pickles, and 5 crumpets. The crumpets were so fresh and hot with the perfect crisped edge. All of the accompaniments were the perfect amount of tartness to cut through the richness of the patÃª. Pig face - The favorite of the night. Topped with a perfect fried egg, the tender pork was the perfect amount of fattiness that sat on top of some hash for texture, paired with cilantro, tamarind, and red wine sauce. So yummy, we definitely plowed through this quickly.Goat shank - a very generous portion and a leaner take on goat meat. I loved the summer quinoa salad it came with. If i had to pick one dish to eliminate, it would be this one only because it wasn't prepared in too special of a manner.Most people seem to order around 5 dishes for 2 people but we were stuffed after these 3. If you want to try more dishes, I would recommend coming in a bigger group since it's a pretty casual rustic restaurant. Even though I thought all of the dishes were prepared well, I decided on 4 stars because of its lack of fresh/lighter options. They do have vegetable and seafood dishes, but even those dishes seemed heavy-handed with the seasoning and sauces, but to each their own. Definitely make reservations a few months in advance. I think we made them online 2.5 months in advance and we were only able to get 4:45pm for a Saturday."
"I've been to Little Goat numerous times and wasn't a big fan (read my Little Goat review). However, I'm a fan of Girl and the Goat. I came here for meeting dinner and we had a customized menu (not sure what the regular menu had to offer). Unfortunately, i wasn't able to take photo of each dish (due to professionalism for this dinner). Overall, it was served family style and each entree mostly veggie dishes were well balanced with flavor. If you have nut allergy, you may have challenge with the menu. Overall, will come back and try something different! BTW, i heard it's really hard to score a reservation.House bread - it was delicious and hearty. Warm and soft complimented with cream cheese butter and tomato.warm marinated olive- Usually not a fan of olive, but these were plump and juicy like a cherry.kohirabi salad (fennel, evalon, toasted almond) - Flavorful and refreshing greenies.Grilled baby octopus (fava bean, pea tips, pistachio, and lemon vinaigrette) - one of my favorite!! the octopus was not too well done and soft. I really like the compliments with the octopus. green garlic pierogies (rhubarb chimichurri) - Favorite... the pierogie was lightly fried and was soft with potato inside. Love it! roasted cauliflower (pinenuts, mint, pickled peppers) - Good, but doesnt stand out.pan roasted halibut (marcona almond butter) - Good and cooked just right. sauteed green beans (fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews) - Good Â and doesn't quite stand out.wood grilled broccoli - least favorite and too salty. No thankscrisp braised pork shank (buttermilk dressing, kimchee sauce, and Â naan) - LOVE IT - pork was soft and tender. It was nicely presented. I recommend skipping the buttermilk dressing and kimchi sauce, which doesnt compliment too well with the pork shank. The pork itself can be eaten alone. assortment of dessert - consist of 4 different ice cream/gelato desserts. All 4 were quite similar (complimented with some sort of chocolate with vanilla ice cream) Â and was really good. I had wish the waiter gave us an explanation of each dessert."
"This is the restaurant of Stephanie Izard (winner of Top Chef 2008) and we were excited to try her food while visiting Chicago. Despite the hype, this place is very down-to-earth and informal so though reservations are highly recommended, you could still get a table with good timing.Food: 5/5Dishes: Hamachi Crudo, Shishito Peppers, Goat Empanadas, Pork Shank, BudinoEverything was delicious and the Hamachi Crudo and Goat Empanadas gave me goosebumps. The flavors and textures all sort of dance on your tongue. It looks like simple, rustic food but it has various layers of complexity that make it surprising and so delicious. Warning - the Shishito Peppers are freaking spicy! Service: 3/5The service wasn't bad, it just felt kind of awkward for me... and it isn't their fault! Our waiter was clearly a seasoned veteran and knew how to handle customers but the charm levels were a bit too high for me. It felt all very artificial and way too slick for my taste. It was impressive but I'm not fond of that kind of service. Atmosphere: 3/5The space feels like a barnhouse, hip and rustic. My complaint is that the air vents were right over our table and it was freezing cold but if you went further in the restaurant it was very warm. Also, it was so loud... it is hard to have a conversation here. Value: 3.5/5Each dish is around $15-20 each and they are tapas so you would have to order 1-2 dishes per person. Given the size of the dishes and price, I felt it was a tad expensive. However, the quality of the dishes were very high! I just wish it wasn't only a few bites of deliciousness for that price."
"Definitely worth planning ahead and making reservations here. 1. Shishito peppers: A bit salty, but so much intense flavor. I personally love my food covered in salt so I didn't mind the heavy hand in the salt jar. 2. Roasted Cauliflower: good, but just a bit too much cauliflower for me. 3. Kohlrabi salad: bright and refreshing. Â Good palate cleansing dish between heavy meat dishes4. Hamachi Crudo: sweet mary moses. I had to restrain myself and let other people taste this one. Delicious. I can't remember what else we had, but everything was definitely on the heavy-flavored side of the scale, which for me, IS ABSOLUTELY PERFECT! I like the family style and casual atmosphere of the restaurant. The drinks were on point, as well as the prices!"
"Interesting place, fully packed.. Reserve in advance because it's not easy to get in. Â The food is good, but not as good as what I was expecting.. I went with a group, and we tried pretty much everything.. the goat empanadas were delicious!"
"Get a reservation here if you can because you will wait a long time if you go during prime hour.My friend and I were about 15 minutes late to our reservation and I alerted the hostess that we would be late, also. They were very lenient when we finally arrived and got seated immediately. Between the two of us, we shared four orders:Pan Fried Shishito Peppers: this was an interesting twist to just regular ol' peppers. I really like the Â unique flavoring of it. Nice little veggie plate to start off dinner.Hamachi crudo: this plate was pure art, I loved the culinary design of it. It was too pretty to eat but after a few snaps, my friend and I digged into it. The hamachi is very fresh but I just wished they gave us a few more slices to the order! Goat empanadas: I don't think I have ever had goat so we tried the goat empanadas. It was surprisingly yummy and I loved that it had avocado in it!Pig face: yes, it's an interesting name but it is what girl & the goat is famous for and I can see why. This was my favorite dish of the night. It came with an egg on top and we were instructed to mix it up before eating. It highlighted so many areas of my taste buds and I could have eaten the entire portion to myself.For four orders between two people, I was just about full. The food here is small portion and quite pricey so definitely don't come here on an empty stomach. Eating here is more of a culinary experience rather than a place to fill up your tummy. Ambiance is dimmed lights and very romantic. But my table was terribly close to our neighboring parties so I did feel a bit awkward. Parking is quite pricey here, $12 for valet but if you don't mind walking about five minutes, there is metered parking about three blocks away on Washington (past the freeway overpass)."
"If you don't have reservations, the wait is around 1-2 hours. Overall, great experience and I'd come back. Our orders:Grilled baby octopus: 8/10 octopus was cooked to perfection but the sauce was a little too salty for me.Manila clam 'bruschetta': 9/10 fresh cooked clams with goat liver mousse baguette. Roasted cauliflower: with pickled peppers and pine nuts. 10/10 Wood oven roasted pig face: with side of egg, potato sticks. 10/10! This was my favorite entree! Crispy potato sticks are sandwiched between two crispy pork. Â I would come back for this for sureConfit goat belly: 10/10 cooked in bourbon butter with lobster and crab."
"No trip to Chicago would be complete without visiting the famed Girl & the Goat - a foodie must! So, naturally we arranged our schedule so that we could visit this establishment during non-peak hours - as the were no available reservations even one month out! Crazy! Anyways, we arrived early on a Wednesday afternoon (before opening actually) so that we could secure a spot. Once we were seated we decided to go all out and tried a large spread of items for two (below)Food* Honey sambal brioche with honey butter and pomelo fresno relish ($4) 4/5 - Warm and fluffy carbs! Yum! A great way to start our meal. * Sauteed Green Beans with fish sauce vinaigrette, cashews ($9) 1/5- It was a pretty substantial amount and more than enough for two to share; however, I wasn't a big fan of the sour taste. It was a bit too strong for my liking. * Pan Roasted Halibut (marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham) $18 The highlight of the meal (!!!) 10/5- Our server informed us that this was a seasonal item and that Chef Stephanie won the Top Chef competition with this dish. Well obviously we had to order this and I'm so glad that we did. It was soft and buttery and I could not get enough of it. It was my favorite dish of my trip and I tried a lot of memorable items. If it's on the menu you'd be a food not to order it Â * Wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potatoe stix ($18) 2/5- This was the most popular item on the menu, but I guess the hype got the best of it. While it was robust in flavor, and I enjoyed the first bite, it was a bit too fatty and dense for me to continue eating more spoonfuls of it. Jeff kept putting it on my plate and I just switched plates with him :P * Confit goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster n' crab, fennel ($19) 2/5- It would seem unpatriotic to not try goat as it's in it's name-sake So, based on another reviewer's recommendation we tried the goat belly. Boy was it disappointing. There were too many components and I actually felt that the lobster and crab took away from the star of the plate - though I did like the seafood alone. Â SummaryEven though there were several dishes that I would pass on, The Girl and the Goat is still a restaurant that I would frequent again. The atmosphere is lively and I cannot praise her award-winning halibut enough. I would definitely come again just to eat that. Â Not sure if I'd wait an hour plus during prime-time dinner hours, but I would definitely come again in the mid-afternoon. I may also try the roasted cauliflower as it was also praised highly, but I'd pass on the red meats as I felt they were a bit too fatty and dense for my likely. Â Overall, a fun place! Check it out!"
I don't understand why this place is one of the top restaurants in Chicago!!!! I big time disagree. The place is pretty but doesn't give up to the hype. Every single dish we have ordered wasn't good at all. The grilled oysters made me almost want to vomit. They were smelly and disgusting couldn't swallow it at all.The octopus. Was very salty..The tongue: which is my favorite dish usually! But This one was inedible.The shrimp was ok but pricy for an okay 4 shrimp $17Beet salad! Was the best out of everything $12We really had such Â a high hope to try this place. It was hard to make reservation and we tried our best to make it here... and in the end we didn't only left hungry but with a stomachache!I definitely do not recommend the girl & goat restaurant!
"Foodie Central. Â All sorts of delicious small plates. Â Chef Izzard puts a South Asian flare to some of her dishes, which is refreshing. Â The fritters and cauliflowers are a must...and definitely try one of the goat dishes. Â Softshell crab was very tasty as well and I hear the pig face is a must-do.FYI -- the bartender, Justin, was a pleasure. Â Vert nice guy and a great mixologist."
"A much belated review but seeing as I may no longer be a Chicago girl as of soon, I thought it was about time to write this one up! We enjoyed a ton of dishes at Girl & the Goat, and just as well since we might've hit up about half the menu in one visit! Some of my favorites: - Start off your meal with the honey sambal brioche bread! Â - Delicious vegetarian options: chickpea fritter, celery root and cheddar pierogies, and the kale salad. I was super impressed with their non-meat options because those were very much on par with their meat dishes.- Grilled pork belly - And my personal favorite dish of the night, the crispy beef short ribs! The seafood eaters at the table further enjoyed the grilled baby octopus, the scallops and the pan roasted trout (not bad!). The roasted pig face didn't live up to the hype for me. I'm not sure what it was but it left a weird aftertaste in my mouth. I also thought the escargot ravioli was a pretty big miss. I was super excited to try it but in all honesty, I felt like I was eating dirt inside the ravioli (really expensive dirt at that), which was a sentiment echoed by a few of my fellow friends....which naturally, kind of killed the entire dish for us. Nonetheless, a very successful night of eating your brains out at Girl & the Goat. Very exciting indeed. Can't wait to have a similar night at Stephanie's Izard's Duck Duck Goat upon my next return to Chicago!"
Amazing! Everything we had was absolutely delicious. Coming from Austin we have a great food scene but this was one of the best meals I have ever had. The halibut was so good that we ordered a second dish of it. The goat empanadas mmmm. Can't say enough great things about this place!
"Im not sure where to begin! This place is absolutely amazing! If you are an adventurous eater, and into ""different"" things, than this is a place that I would put on your list when in Chicago. Â The owner is Stephanie Izard, who won Top Chef (the Bravo TV show), she opened the Girl and The Goat, back in 2010. Â While doing some research for our trip, this place kept coming up! Then one night, we were watching a show on FoodNetwork, and yet again, we saw this place! After reading some reviews on yelp, I called (a month in advance) and made a reservation!After taking a look at the menu, we decided on a few different things. Â I should mention that these are all small dishes, so our waitress recommended we order between 5-7, which of course we did! We ordered the Spring Onion Pierogies, Goat Empanadas, Squash Blossom Crab Rangoon, Grilled Baby Octopus, the Tartare Special, and one of the bread specials, that I can remember at the moment! Everything was so AMAZING!!! Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned, and a decent portion! Definitely enough for two people to share! We also, had two cocktails (La Paloma...yes!!!!!) and for dessert we had the Chocolate Truffle cake, which, well, just try it!!! All in all everything was amazing! The atmosphere is pretty awesome as well, lots of seating, open kitchen concept, so you see all the chefs working, which I personally enjoy. Â Our waitress was fantastic, so sweet, so informative and so attentive!! If you plan on coming, MAKE A RESERVATION!!!!! Â Enjoy!"
"I can never resist provocative flavors and innovative dishes and Girl & the Goat delivers on both fronts. Â ----The Food----Crisp Braised Pork Shank ($26)- WOW. One bite of this tender, succulent pork shank and I delved into my own happy world--nothing else mattered. Â Sharing this flavorful creation will be the worst part of your meal. Â The Kimchee wing sauce and buttermilk dressing make perfect, tasteful dips for the pillowy soft naan too. Roasted Pig Face ($18)- This wood oven dish was good, but fell short of expectations, especially since it's one of the more popular signature plates on the menu. It comes with a sunny side egg, Â crispy potato stix, drizzled in tamarind vinaigrette, red-wine maple sauce and cilantro oil. Â It's reminiscent of the pig face at Animal in LA, but more subdued in taste. Â It's messy, it's good, just not mind blowing.Grilled Marinated Pork Belly ($15)- Served with radicchio and an aromatic green sauce resembling pureed cilantro and avocado, this pork belly plate had an uplifting, light flavor, but the consistency of the pork belly was oft-putting. Â I felt it was undercooked, giving it a chewier consistency than I can bear. Â Confit Goat Belly ($19)- While I'm a big fan of this order, I disliked the tiny portion. Â Smothered in heavy bourbon butter and sprinkled sparingly with lobster/crab, it's a comforting plate that didn't taste as gamey as I thought it would. Â Roasted Cauliflower ($11)- Accompanied with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mint, it's a refreshing appetizer that is as good as Bar Ama's in LA.Pan Roasted Halibut ($18)- I hate fish, but this masterpiece melts in your mouth and makes your eyes roll back to your skull. Â Made with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham, the flavors are wonderfully surprising and unique. Â Amazing.-----Conclusion: 4.5 Stars. Your inner carnivore will thank you, after giving the Girl & the Goat a visit. Â I believe Chef Izard didn't need to be on Top Chef to gain popularity because her evocative and exquisite dishes speak for themselves. Â The food, service, atmosphere, and even decor have a boisterous spirit that's contagious--you'll be overjoyed to be there. Â I just wish the portions were bigger and the prices were cheaper.Extra Notes:-Accepts credit card-Make reservations before hand! I made mine 3 months in advance-Fantastic, suggestive service-Dim-lit, but loud environment--a fun place to dine or date. -Decor is beautiful in a hipsterish kind of way-The art work is almost psychodelic -Restrooms are clean"
"The hubby and I dined the Girl & the Goat three years ago but made the huge mistake of having a large lunch beforehand and early reservation here. We were too full to enjoy the meal. This time, we came starving. We ordered the three types of oysters (four oysters in each order) which came raw, barbecued and fried. Delicious. We also got the escargot ravioli as well as the goat's liver mousse with its yummy bread, tasty green beans and the famous pig's face. All the dishes were delicious and left us feeling very satisfied."
"Most memorable things:Pig face!!!!! Â What??? Â  That's right! Â Was soooo good!!! Â Could eat it all day!!! Â  Pork shank was ""fall off the bone"" delish!!!! Â So juicy n tender with a lot of flavor!! Â Flavor of the meat, not from salt or seasoning. Â Miso-butterscotch budino was amazing! Â Defiantly will have to go back to try more of the goat dishes. Â The ones we had were just ok. Â (Goat empanadas n goat belly confit.)(Some mislabeling of dishes)"
"Good restaurant and scene. The crudo and pig face are the clear winning dishes here. It can be a little loud, it can be a little crowded, it can be a little over hyped but then again Izard won top chef for a reason and is a celebrity chef. Deal with it. -1 for dessert not being anything to write home about IMO."
"Not a lot to say that hasn't been said; great food if you like to eat things with hooves, not so great if you don't."
"When we visited Chicago, Stephanie Izzard's restaurant was definitely at the top of our list. We were unable to make reservations but I had read that sometimes if you check their Facebook, they'll post last minute openings so luckily we were able to come in on a Sunday night on our last night of the trip. Ambiance is nice, definitely dark so expect to use that embarrassingly bright flash if you're trying to take pictures. From what I remember, service was great! Oven roasted pig face is definitely a must-try! But everything we ordered was pretty delicious. A little disappointed by dessert as nothing really jumped off the menu and screamed, ""order me!"" Got the date cake anyway and it was alright. Would definitely come back to try more stuff of the menu!"
"This is the hottest restaurant in Chicago, so of course I had to check it out while visiting. Reservations are definitely difficult to get, so plan ahead (like really ahead). I made the reservations over a month in advance, and the only time I got was a Monday night at 9:30pm. Upon arriving, the place was definitely happening. We got seated right away and our server came by to offer us drinks. But of course with my luck, Chef Stephanie was not in the house. Food was delicious! Definitely need to order the Pig Face. As others on Yelp have written, you don't get the actual face/head of the pig. Instead, you get deliciousness! Just order it! Another must try for the adventurous are the goat dishes. C'mon, the place is called Girl & the Goat, you have to try at least one dish off the goat menu. The waitress said the safest dish for the not too adventurous was the goat empanada. It was delicious! And you don't really taste the gaminess you expect from goat. Overall, this is definitely a must-try when in Chicago. So book early to snag a table. But in the case you don't get a table here, you can always go to their diner and bakery that are right across the street (literally)."
"Wowza! Girl & the Goat has been on my list for a while now, and let's just say, I wasn't disappointed.Some girlfriends and I had dinner here the other night and the entire experience was spectacular. We were seated promptly at our reservation time and the restaurant was bustling. Highlights: everything. Seriously. Everything was superb. We started with a bottle of pinot noir and the brioche with samba honey butter. Each dish came out as a separate course and we ate our way though the roasted cauliflower, halibut, crispy short ribs, pig face, and grilled octopus. Every dish was perfectly balanced with interesting flavor combinations and just enough acid to round them out. We ended the meal with the miso-butterscotch budino, and called it a night with full bellies."
"FINALLY! After waiting for months, we got a reservation to Girl and the Goat. I was super excited, since I'm a huge fan of Stephanie Izard and absolutely love Little Goat across the street. G&TG is a small plates restaurant, where you order a few to try and share among your dining companions. Prices are pretty steep, but you get high quality food. Husband and I are teetotalers, so we opted not to get any drinks (good thinking, since they were $13 a pop) and ordered a few plates to share.We got the goat belly, goat empanadas, hamachi crudo, calamari bruschetta, ham frites, and duck tongues. One thing I noticed at the end of the meal is that they progressed our meal from lightest to heaviest. I thought that was pretty cool (husband said he would have preferred the opposite, but he would have gotten The Itis after the first course, I guarantee you). I enjoyed everything, but there were some dishes I enjoyed more than others. The goat belly was delicious, as always. The bourbon butter it was in was very sweet and too weird for me. I also could have sworn I tasted peanut butter in it! The goat empanadas were funky but tasty. I ate the avocado/blueberry sauce that was leftover with a spoon. The hamachi crudo was the star of the night: light fish with little pieces of pork belly and chili aoili. The calamari bruschetta was soooo oily. It was delicious, don't get me wrong, but it was swimming in a pool of oil or butter, maybe a bit of both. It made me glad I don't have my gallbladder anymore. The ham frites were tasty shoestring fries with some kind of ham salt, served with smoked tomato aioli and beer cheese sauce. The duck tongues were great! They just tasted like fried clams. There were little pieces of raw tuna mixed in as well. We didn't get dessert, but instead opted to go across the street to Little Goat and get a Choco Taco sundae.Another thing worth noting that I appreciate: they leave a wine bottle of room temperature water at the table. As someone who is overly sensitive to cold drinks, this was a life saver. I killed two bottles of it."
"How does one end a trip to Chicago in a perfect way? I'll tell you how.. By having dinner at Girl and the Goat. And when I say perfect, I mean it from the first sip of alcohol to the last bite of food.I ventured in here on a Saturday evening after hearing reading a great article about it. Reservations apparently have to be made at least a few weeks out in order to have a chance at dining here, but I tried my chances at finding seating at he bar. While waiting for a seat to open up, I ordered the ""Thai one on"" cocktail which immediately took me to heaven. A mixture of rum, brandy, passion fruit and Thai chili syrup, it's one the best cocktails I've ever had.After about twenty minutes, a seat opened up at the bar and I got busy on some food. It's recommended you order three dishes since the portions are small, (which is true) so I ordered the chickpea fritters, the crispy beef short ribs and the seared diver scallops.The fritters were excellent. They are made with a tamarind and mango sauce, which added a sweetness making it perfect. The scallops were unbelievable. It came topped with ginger chili, mushrooms and peanuts. So the taste was about as unique a scallop dish I've ever had. The short ribs, made with a grapefruit chermoula sauce, was the home run dish of the evening as it was definitely the best short ribs I've ever had. Tender, juicy and the sauce gave it an amazing flavor.Everything's about Girl and the Goat was absolutely perfect, down to the cool r&b music music playing in the background. It's a loungey atmosphere, yet chill at the same time. Bartender gave a thorough explanation of the menu and how each patron should go about ordering. This whole experience was excellent and is an absolute must in my opinion when visiting Chicago."
"So I feel like we cheated a bit here, given that we'd heard so much about the Girl and the Goat from friends and that it's so highly reviewed. Nevertheless, we always choose 1 great restaurant to go to every time we visit my parents in the 'burbs (We're from Denver) and the Girl and the Goat had finally come up. In debating ratings, hubby and I agreed on a 5 because we simply could not think of a single dish that was anything less than excellent. The blueberry jam with the bread was rich, the bread itself having the right amount of butter. The green beans have ruined me for green beans ever again, with their delightful cashews and savory sauce. The chicken had just the right amount of smoked flavor to reflect a wood fired approach without being too smoky, and the halibut was polished off in seconds flat by my other half. We also loved the Pierogis and the service was on point (helpful without being obtrusive and with great (and enthusiastic) explanations of every dish). So many other nice touches, such as the fact that our water glasses never had the chance to be empty, the drinks were perfectly mixed and the server brought out a free birthday dessert for my husband (I'd noted it was his birthday in the reservations). Along those lines, be sure to save room for dessert! We ordered a second blackberry cake Â in addition to the budino (which wowed with its salty butterscotch flavor and homemade whipped cream) and both were incredible!"
"Amazing and innovative menu, delicious and unique flavors, great service, classy and relaxed atmosphere. Girl & the Goat is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard does not dissapoint!We had reservations for a group of four on a weeknight, and were glad we did because it was a full house. Braised beef tongue - an amazing dish, the beef was cooked well and enjoyed the texture and flavors with masa, beef vinaigrette, salsa verda.Wood oven roasted pig face - so delicious and a must try. served with sunny side up egg, cilantro, and blended with flavors of red wine-maple, potato stix. Escargot ravioli with bacon - snail and bacon together equals heaven in my mouth! loved the tamarind-miso sauce.Bittersweet chocolate - loved the creamy and rich flavors of this dessert.Miso butterscotch budino - I really enjoyed this dessert with it's sweet and caramel flavors with the custard pudding goodness.Service was friendly, professional and prompt. Definitely make sure you make reservations as this place is popular and gets busy for dinnertime, especially with a bigger group. Prices are a bit steeper but is worth the quality and innovation of the food. They even have the most adorable little logo of a little cartoon Goat, which I love. What is there not to love about Girl & the Goat?Overall I really enjoyed my experience at this restaurant. The food is amazing, service is flawless and we all had a great time."
"We were completely blown away by this place. Â We made reservations approx one month in advance for a 6pm slot, prior to going the show Book of Mormon. Â I'll start by saying we were seated at the front of the house, near the entrance windows. Â The seating was very tight, but the service was quick. Â Despite the restaurant being full to capacity, the waitress was extremely attentive. The drink menu is extensive, we elected to go with some of the craft beers on tap. Â They were delivered in the appropriate types of beer glasses, perfectly chilled.Now the Apps.....we ordered all vegetarian items...starting with the bread with butter....it was so amazing, it melted in our mouth....next we had the chillies with parmesan cheese...OMG...it was the most amazing preparation of green chillies I have ever had..they were perfectly flavored with just the right amount of spice....the perfect accompaniment to a cold beer. Â After that we had the chick pea fritters....it was like I died and went to heaven....I am embarrassed that someone in the USA took an Indian classic and elevated it to a heavenly level. Â The perfect blend of spices and soft and crunchy....I was blown away....The last app we tried was the cauliflower, it was good, not my favorite, my wife loved it, but I think it was ok.As for dessert we tried two different items....both were spectacular. Â I wish I could remember the names.....but it doesn't really matter...the take away from this review is that everything at Girl & the Goat is outstanding. Â One the best restaurants I have been to in the Chicago area."
I arrived at 4pm it opens at 430pm. There was already a line!!!But no worries I got seated immediately at 430p. Everyone got seated it seems so come here at 4:15pm latest and you'll get seated I ordered 3 items off the list. It's all communal food. First was the duck tongues. Wow get this seriously! It was refreshing and just so unique. There was tuna in it as well. Yum yum I've never tasted anything like this before. Just wow wow wow. Â 5/5 Second was the pig face. There's an egg that's sunny side up on it. You're advised to mix it all up and eat it. Yummy. 5/5Third was the goat belly and confit. This was delicious as well. I just wasn't a big fan of the smell for some odd reason but still 5/5It was a special occasion (told them it was my anniversary with my gf when I made the reservation at 1130p which I cancelled when I arrived at 430p that day instead). They gave us free dessert. Wow wow so 5/5 too.
"It was Sunday night in Chicago and I was on the hunt for where to have dinner my last night in town. Â After considerable head scratching and debating with myself in my hotel room I decided on Girl & the Goat to start my night.My first tip to anyone reading this that might be in town on a business trip like I was: Dont even try to make last second reservations on the weekend. This place is extremely busy and for good reason, the food was outstanding! (I'll get to that in a minute). If you only have a small group I would recommend walking in sometime around 6 PM and asking for a table. You will likely be told that there is a 1.5 to 2+ hour wait which is to be expected, however the actual wait time based on my experience and some other locals I had spoken with was considerably less (half the estimate). In addition, the planed wait time will allow you to walk right across the street to the Highly reviewed Lonely Wolf Bar to sit down and Sample some of their excellent cocktails while you wait. Â Don't worry, Girl & the Goat will text you when your table is ready and your blood alcohol levels will be pre-primed for the experience!Now onto the important part, the food...Because I was dining alone (I cleverly evaded my colleagues' typical business trip steak dinners) I decided to splurge on three of their top-rated dishes. Each one of them was unique, complex, and beyond impressive. Â Here are my thoughts on each:Wood Oven Roasted Pigs Face:.Even during my preliminary research the thought of pigs face in a dish admitting only made my stomach turn. I have been to many pig roasts and I'm not a freak that generally eats the face and eyes the roasted pig (although I will grab at the rest of the pig like a crazed zombie). Â This dish easily surfaced as my favorite throughout my meal. As you can see in the countless photos on yelp the pig faces is served topped with a fried egg. The flavor of the warm yoke blends with the fat in the slice of pork so well I having trouble putting it into words... Add tamarind, cilantro, and red wine-maple; Â It was heavenly. Â Just order it. Â No more questions please.Pan Roasted Halibut:The halibut was outstanding, initially slightly salty and quickly transitioned into spicy and sweet with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, blueberry nuoc cham, The ginger,and the mushrooms just added to the variety. It was incredibly complex and delicious. I would order this again in a heartbeat. Â Grilled Baby Octopus:The baby octopus dish was served with fava beans, pea, pistachios and a lemon vinaigrette. Â I LOVED the use of the fava beans In this dish. I have ordered octopus countless times over the years in many countries and this was easily the most unique presentation I have encountered. Very good.If I could add a + to the end of my 5 stars I would. Â A meal like this in New York City would easily have cost double the price. Follow my advice, walk in, reserve a table, and go get drinks across the street while you wait for a text message. I promise you you will not be disappointed. 5+Next time I am in Chicago I will be back 100%"
"Like most other Chicagoans, my boyfriend and I had to make a reservation a few months in advance. This built up the anticipation of eating here and we were not disappointed!I don't know what half of the ingredients are in the dishes but they are 5 stars every time! We shared the chickpea fritters, calamari bruschetta, and the crisp braised pork shank. For dessert we had the miso-butterscotch budino. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING! We can't wait to go back!"
"Aside from Alinea, this was my favorite meal in the Chi Town!// LOCATION // West Loop across the street from Au Cheval and Little Goat Diner. // RESERVATIONS // Very necessary if its a busy weekend. We went Memorial Day weekend with a large party and made our reservations more than 1 month ahead of time. If you have a smaller party, you may get lucky with walk in. // SERVICE // Excellent. Your water cup will never be empty and I was very impressed by how the dishes were brought out and staggered so you can build on the flavor compositions and appreciate each dish before sampling the next. // FOOD //  Â  Â  + Shishito peppers: Good with a spicy kick  Â  Â  + Tongue salad: Loved the citrus-y dressing  Â  Â  + Goat carpaccio: light and refreshing  Â  Â  + Grilled octopus: Super tender and well flavored  Â  Â  + Pork shank: ridiculously fall-off-the-bone-shred-it-with-a-fork tender Â  Â  + Pan roasted halibut: very savory *tip: Make reservations!*tip: Approximately 2 dishes per person is good to start with if you are trying to get full here. Order 2 of dishes you really want to try if you have a party of 5 or more so there is enough to go around."
"I totally get the hype! We took our chances and just showed up around 9 pm on a Tuesday. We luckily walked right in and got 2 seats at the bar, which is first come-first serve. Drinks = excellent! I loved the Lux Goods, which is gin with a little kick.Food = amazing! The Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face and the Confit Goat Belly were two of the most incredible dishes I've ever had. Both full of flavor and textures! I would strongly recommend. The Escargot Ravioli and Broccoli were both great too, but I'd be willing to try something else recommended from the veggie and fish options. Dessert = The Best! I would be fine with having the Miso-Butterscotch Budino as the only dessert for the rest of my life!Cheese = I love that they have after-dinner cheese options for those of us that don't always want sweets. We got a creamy and a stinky, both equally as delicious. Sorry, I don't remember the names, we only asked for creamy and stinky! Bartenders = Informative, attentive and entertaining!"
One thing I noticed about Chicago's cuisine is that they sure do love their tapas. Portions are pretty small so you must order a minimum of four to five dishes between two people to get full. Â The girl and the goat specializes mainly in GOAT (DUH) and pork. I was excited to try this place because this was the highest rated restaurant from all the restaurants we went to in Chicago (btw I'm A tourist here) but definetly wasn't the best restaurant that we tried. We tried the Chickpea fritters. The chickpea fritters was very well seasoned and they made it so that the taste resembled meat. It was served with a tangy yogurt sauce which balanced out the deep flavors of the chickpeas.Grilled baby octopus- good but heavily seasoned with salt. Ordered a brioche bun because it was too salty to eat alone. Their breads all come with unique home made butters and sauce to accentuate the taste. Also tried the goat confit with lobsters and the goat empanyadas. The best unexpected thing was the empanyadas. They were Perfect. HIghly recommend the empanyadas.
"My aunt and uncle were visiting from Israel and they asked me to take them somewhere delicious and quintessentially Chicago. With only a few hours to book a reservation, I took a chance on the website and saw a last minute spot available for Girl & The Goat. Â After hearing stories about months long waiting lists, I couldn't pass up the opportunity. From the first step inside you know that this place is something special. It blends something of Chicago's storied working class reputation with the city's trendy up-and-coming elite. The food was delicious as well as reasonably priced for the quality of the flavor profiles. The dishes were served tapas-style, so that the table could share and savor each dish. The service was friendly and attentive. Our waiter did such a good job of pacing the dishes and choosing the order of them that we had to call him an artist!My favorite dish was the sugo, with the most unexpected and bright gooseberries. My aunt and uncle's favorite was the calamari bruschetta, which had the feel of biting into a leather chair next to a fireplace on a cloudy day in a house by the seaside. Coming in at a close second was the roasted cauliflower. Next time, I would order a second helping of the bread and do without the grilled chicken and grilled broccoli."
"There's probably nothing else that needs to be said for a place with 3000+ positive reviews. What I will say is that you need reservations WAY in advance. I made a decision that I was going to Chicago and my first thought was I needed to book a time for this restaurant. Â As such, I was pretty hyped up about finally getting to the place a month later. Â It didn't disappoint as the two dishes I tried, the escargot ravioli and pig face, were absolutely amazing. Try and you won't regret it. There were some side dishes on the table from the party I dined with but I was pretty much in my own food zone once my plates arrived. Â Hat's off to you, Stephanie Izard. Next stop, Little Goat!"
"The best food during my short Chicago trip, including a meal at Alinea! Everything we had was soooo delish! Fried oysters, goat liver pate, roasted cauliflower, pomme frites, goat empanadas, baby octopus, pig face, basically EVERYTHING was sooo freaking good. Chef Stephanie Izard is the real deal. Legit food, affordable prices, and unpretentious service. You have to make reservations weeks in advance and it's totally worth it. I wish I had enough room for dessert because that butterscotch pineapple sounded so good, but the elastic pants I was wearing could not hold in my tummy long enough for dessert. Chicago is so lucky to have such good food available. Dallas sucks."
"If you're ever in Chicago you must come here. Worth the hype. The dishes are small so you can get several and share them. We loved every single dish that we ordered. Taco bread, chickpea fritters, goat empanadas, halibut. All amazing. We were scared to try the pig's face but it ended up being our favorite dish. So good! Â We ended the meal with the miso butterscotch budino. We didn't have reservations, so we got there at 4:30pm. We were seated within 15 minutes. They gave us an hour and half time limit to eat, which was more than enough. The servers did a great job of bringing out the next dish just as you were finishing up the one in front of you. Don't leave Chicago without trying this place."
"My girlfriend and I were visiting from out of town. We had late night reservations but it was definitely worth waiting to eat. Our waitress, Alex, was the best thing to the meal. She directed us around the menu and made some recommendations on portions. We had two things we knew we wanted to try and let her choose the others. We had the goat liver pate, pork belly, baby octopus, and broccoli.This is going to sound silly, but the broccoli was the best part of the meal. It was delicious and complimented everything. The others were all fantastic as well (liver pate was strong), but that broccoli !!!After being so full, Alex (our waitress) suggested dessert. We said we were way too full. But after learning we were from out of town, she ended up bringing us a complimentary dessert. Overall, the experience as amazing from service to food. Highly recommend at any hour you can get a reservation."
Loved it! The ambience is wonderful and everything we tried was fantastic.
"I came at around 10 pm on a Thursday and was able to get seated within 10 min, but we decided to stay at the lounge/couch side since the full menu is available there and it was probably easier to hear each other since the restaurant is noisy. If I didn't know any better is think I was at an Asian fusion restaurant. Anyway, nothing here disappointed. And be sure to end with that budino.JONASAPPROVED!"
"If you've read my other reviews you'll know it's extremely rare for me to give a 5-star rating, but in this case it could not be more warranted. I've been wanting to come here for several years and finally had an opportunity to cross it off my bucket list during a business trip in June 2015. I brought along two employees, one of which is extremely hard to please, and neither were disappointed (actually got some huge thank yous for introducing them).We had called to make reservations over a month in advance for a Sunday evening, but they were booked solid. They still told us we could try and slide in, or opt to sit at the bar. Upon arrival it was pretty cozy with a sectioned off patio on the street out front. Nothing pretentious or overdone with regard to the decor - just a warm inviting place.They have a solid beer and spirit selection, and while I went with a couple of bourbons and an IPA with the main meal I was pretty enticed by their signature drinks. The bartender brought us a complimentary order of the green beans which were served with a very savory sauce - good stuff. We opted to go tapas style and started with the goat empanadas and the calamari over goat ricotta bruschetta, both of which were excellent. The empanadas were crisp with very tender goat inside. Not a huge fan of the blueberries served with this (also included crumbled goat cheese and crushed pecans over guacamole I believe), but it actually worked. The calamari bruschetta was truly great and highly recommended (menu description: Â clam baguette. goat milk ricotta. goat bacon. green tomato). Wish I could have two more plates of it right now, but sadly I'm back in Atlanta.We then shared two orders of the pork belly and the pork shank (they had sold out of the goat shank. WOW. Â Both were phenomenal and a must-try if you only have one night in town. Â Menu descriptions below, but sadly didn;t catch a shot of the pork belly dishes in my attachments.grilled marinated pork bellycastelfranco. sauce green. blackberriescrisp braised pork shankbuttermilk dressing. grilled spring onion kimchee. naan"
"My boyfriend surprised me with Â trip to Chicago for our third anniversary, and G&TG is where I decided to have our anniversary dinner. Heads up, even a month out, reservations were unavailable, so plan ahead. If you get here at opening, the bar area is available first come, first serve. We were able to be seated at a community table easily, but the restaurant was fairly busy by the time we left (6PM, Friday).WOOD FIRED OYSTERS: I'm not generally an oyster fan, but these were amazing, and stood out from what you can get anywhere else on the block. Great lemon and bacon accents.YO QUIERO TACO BREAD: Not even going to try to make this sound classy. This bread tastes like cheese and beef, it's like Taco Bell flavors baked into a soft, round loaf and served with pico de gallo and an addictive cheddar-onion dip. Didn't go with anything else we ordered, but it was a fun start to our meal.DUCK TONGUES with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, piri piri: A dish suggested to us by our server, this was tasty with southwestern accents and plenty of textures. ROASTED CAULIFLOWER with pickled peppers, pinenuts, and mint: This is what a vegetable dish should be! Fresh, crunchy, flavorful. I really enjoyed this. GOAT EMPANADAS with smoked blueberry tapenade and avocado: The dish I was most looking forward to! Two small and delicate handpies, filled with shredded goat. The meat was on the dry side, but the flavor was meaty and complemented well by the fruit and avocado. Wish there was a third empanada for this $16 order.CONFIT GOAT BELLY with bourbon butter, lobster n crab, and fennel: Underwhelming. The belly was a little overcooked and the flavor profile heavily favored the seafood rather than serving to highlight the goat. This was decent but not something I would necessarily get again.PAN ROASTED HALIBUT with marcona almond butter, white asparagus, and blueberry nuoc cham: This is not the halibut dish Stephanie Izard won Top Chef with, as another review mentions. Halibut is a fish that is difficult to flavor, and though this dish was plated with a wonderful sauce, the portions of fish that were not submerged were dry and basic. I'm glad we got this dish but again, I'd try something else next time.CHOCOLATE TRUFFLE CAKE: Chocolate with coconut accents makes this a fun dessert reminiscent of the flavors of an Almond Joy. The cake portion was on the small side, dwarfed by the large scoop of ice cream atop it, which was coated in a Magic-Shell-like splash of hardened chocolate. I liked that this dessert wasn't too sweet. Service was attentive and friendly throughout, from the ever-present bussers and our designated server, who happily provided us several recommendations for dishes that aren't as often mentioned in reviews. Perhaps as good as the food itself was the community table view straight into the bustling kitchen, making for dinner and a show!"
"Given the hype, I was a bit disappointed with G&G. The menu was exciting, but the execution on some dishes was flawed.Highlights were the duck tongues and pork face. Both were well-composed, tasty, and texturally interesting.The beet salad was bland despite listing anchovies as an ingredient. The octopus was over-seasoned and chewy. The halibut was dry.Overall the meal was enjoyable, but fell short of the hype and the prices."
"Stephanie Izard is the bomb.com Who is she? She's only the first chick who won Top ChefHer style is unique filled with passion deftly balancing the savory, sweet and tartflavors to every single dish. The menu consist of small plates, so no thing is very bog or expensive. I don't want to bore you with what I ate so check out my photos! All this is delivered in a casual, converted-loft environment with unadorned wood tables and painted concrete floors, illuminated by mounted spotlights, dangling Edison bulbs and some nifty tube lights over a bar and hip hop music in the back ground! Everyone was pleasant and very informative which made our meal the best!Thank you again!"
"I had a solo trip to Chicago and hearing it's a big food city I planned appropriately for a dining and drinking expedition for one. Unfortunately I did not have drinks at G&tG, but I was helped out by my lovely server, Alex, on how to navigate the menu. I really wanted the pig face (I mean have you seen it? Who wouldn't??) but she advised against it for a solo diner because it's so rich and filling. this restaurant is meant to be approached ""family style"" ordering multiple dishes not unlike tapas (but actually good). Some dishes can also be ordered in ""mini"" half portions which is fantastic for someone who wants to just try something but not necessarily fill up on it. I mentioned my interest in seafood and she pointed me out to the salmon. I originally looked passed it because I am a salmon and pea junkie at home- I eat it about 2x a week if not more, and have a dedicated shoe box just for my Trader Joe's petite pea collection in my freezer along with my bulk bag of salmon from Costco. Did I really travel halfway across the country to eat what I usually have? Well, thank god Alex was there because because it totally reapproached peas and salmon in a new light. The salmon was interpreted in a Japanese fashion channeling ramen with a rich goat dashi and nori, peas, and popcorn furikake. Lemon zest dots the furikake imparting bright, citrus aromas. The tender, sweet asparagus cuts up the rich flavors like a culinary intermission. This dish was truly an experience! The roasted cauliflower went beautifully with the mint and lemon. My ""least favorite"" dish of the night was the goat carpaccio but that itself was fantastic. I'm not much of a goat eater but the meat has a surprisingly mild flavor. Paired with the smoke trout roe and olive slivers, it simultaneously channeled smoked salmon with capers and sashimi at the same time. Last but not least were my TWO desserts. I do not normally order dessert. I don't even have much of a sweet tooth, but I thought- why not, let's just have the full course. I was eyeballing the horchata rice pudding with the rhubarb semifreddo but Alex asked me to trust her and gently suggested the toffee cake. Best. dessert. ever. The candied cashews were incredible. The toffee cake was incredible. Everything about this dessert was incredible. Once again, I'm not a dessert person, and I would order this again in a heartbeat. She sent out the rice pudding anyways for me to try, and despite being utterly fantastic as well, the toffee cake is where it's at! I am floored by the quality of food and the level of service for the price I paid. Such quality, well-prepared food in such an unpretentious environment, almost unheard of where I am. I just wanted to cry knowing that I live almost 700 miles away from this place. I don't like to repeat myself when I travel but honest to goodness, this is not a place you want to skip over if you're dropping into town. I know I'm going out of my way to fit G&tG into my itinerary next time I'm in Chicago (and I will find someone to try the goat leg and pig face!)"
"The wait is very long if you do not have a reservation. And people will grab your seats if you are not in attack mode. What they will make you do for food. The food is good but the hype is too much. Its expensive too. With tip we paid hundred dollars.We got the soft shell crab (good flavour, but could have been crunchier), goat confit (good), halibut (good, not great) and the pork belly (did not really like this dish.The castelfranco was bitter. The green sauce and caperberries were not working together)For dessert we got the budino. This I must say was excellent. Best of all. Overall not bad."
"I was there New Year's Eve 2014, it was my big nite to meet my meteor chef, hand down to new year Eve party, music, food, and drink!! I hope I will go again for big party"
What can I possibly say that 3600 other reviewers haven't said??? Food is delishly outstanding and perfectly seasoned. Flavor combinations are unique and well balanced. Short ribs with grapefruit were amazing!I also digged the booming music and casual atmosphere.
"Holy cow. Everything we tried was a home run. Brown butter butter? DELICIOUSIts expensive, but totally worth it for a special night out."
"Pretty good restaurant. Not in my top 10 list worldwide or anything, but generally solid and enjoyable. Cauliflower was my fav item of all things ordered. The flavor was really complex. Â Second would be the pig face. The texture is a little similar to that of pork belly. Scrumptious, but a little heavy, esp with the crispy fried potato strings sandwiched in between two slabs of the meat. Â agree with a previous reviewer that it could use some more acidity to lighten it up a bit to make it a more well rounded dish.Halibut and ratatouille bread were good. Â Roasted chicken not so much -- was way too salty - almost considered returning it. Service was outstanding - everytime our water cups needed a refill, someone miraculously appeared to pour us some water before I can even reach the water jug on the table. Overall a pretty good restaurant but it seems hyped up. Â You can probably find a comparable or better restaurant in any other major US city, that's easier to get a reservation at. I wouldn't mind coming back, but wouldn't wait in line for it (or wait for a 2-3 month reservation)."
"Awesome ambiance, incredibly tasty and unique menu. I highly recommend!Customer service is also great- they once accidentally threw away my leftovers (I didn't care in the least) and they gave me the whole meal for myself and my friend free!I recommend the vegetarian quesadillas and the ravioli. Â Their ""nachos"" are also out of this world."
"I was pleasantly surprised to be able to score last minute same day reservations for G&G for a reasonable dining hour, 6:45pm last week.. Â The last time I visited years ago, we snagged one of the first-come, first serve open tables near the entrance that don't need reservations. Â It's fine until people start hovering around you waiting for your to leave for your spot. Â We checked in a little early, but were seated about 10-15 mins past our reservation time.It was definitely nice to have the full dining experience in the main dining area. Â My only complaint about the seating is how close the tables are, making it especially difficult for someone who's 7 months pregnant, like me, to squeeze into the seat. Â Our server was very nice and took the time to explain the menu to my friend, who was visiting for the first time.We started with the Honey Sambal Brioche - the bread was fresh, warm, and melt in your mouth delicious especially slathered with the honey butter. Â I enjoyed the pomelo relish which was a refreshingly light compliment to the butter. Â My next favorite dish was the Chickpea Fritter. Â It was like a texture and flavor party in my mouth. Â Amazing. Â My friend's favorite dish was the Crispy Beef Short Ribs, which Â were also a nice combination of flavor and texture. Â The Pig Face was definitely rich and something to try at least once. Â Chopped pig face, aka sisig, is one of my favorite Filipino dishes. Â The combination with the crispy potato stix and sunny side egg totally merged my love of sisig with my other love and twist to a staple Filipino breakfast item, corned beef hash! Â My least favorite dish was the Grilled Baby Octopus. Â It was just oversalted, how could you mess that up?We forced ourselves to split a dessert, the miso-butterscotch budino, which was recommended by our server. Â It was like a pot of liquid gold sprinkled with bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashews. Â The smokiness and tart of the pineapple really went well with the butterscotch.I definitely felt at home, eating comforting foods and breaking fresh bread with friends."
"Definitely worth the hype.My friend called each day twice a day till she managed a reservation within a week of our trip to Chicago, which is impressive considering you have to book almost a month in advance.We ordered several vegetarian dishes and one goat empanada dish and each one blew us away.They did a great job of staggering each dish so we would all pass it around, savor it for a while and as we were getting low, the next one would arrive in perfect succession.We meant to try the goat belly but we were so full we had to cancel it! Every dish was packed with flavor. None of us at the table like cauliflower but it came recommended so we all reluctantly tried and it turned out to be everyone's favorite dish of the night. The bread app was fantastic, the goat empanadas just melted in our mouths, and the ramp salad was so well-rounded with the smoked blueberries.I can't wait to be back!"
"It's very good. It's not worth a 30-day+ wait to get a reservation at a time, that's not 10 PM. The bar area is full or jackasses. That's not their fault, but you should know it. The menu is great. It's large, diverse and offers something for everyone. This is a rare place where the portions are big enough that you can actually share the plates. The staff is friendly and helps you navigate your way around the menu. Good drinks; definitely generous pourers. There's nothing wrong with Girl And The Goat, but it's not going to deliver on the hype surrounding it or the build up you've created after finally scoring a reservation. Buyer, beware."
"My sister made reservations for my birthday at Girl and the Goat when I went to visit her in Chicago. I'm a huge fan of Top Chef and to have been able to go to Chef Izard's restaurant, it was just the perfect birthday dinner. It wasn't until we got there, did we realize it was served tapas style, small portions of each order. We took advantage of that and ordered practically one dish off each section of the menu. 1. We started with the Herbs of Feta. Fresh bread with hummus and feta oil dip, what a great combination! You can taste the herbs on the bread, and the crunch on the crust of the bread was delicious. I couldn't get enough of the hummus, almost spooned it all onto my plate. 2. Now, I'm not a huge fan of oysters, especially raw but why not just try it in a different way? Fried, you say? Yum, yum! Fried Naked Cowboys was recommended by our waiter and wow! He wasn't wrong. A spoonful of bite sized oysters with egg salad on top, it was just marvelous. Who doesn't liked fried stuff? I would definitely want this again. 3. Favorite dish of the night, Chickpea Fritter! Love the crispy outer layer and then when you bite into it, you get a soft filling of chickpea in the inside. Love the bite with all the other garnishes and vegetables in this dish. Beyond amazing. 4. So other seafood options were pretty typical choices, so we decided to try something new, Pan Roasted Monkfish. It had a great sear to it. Wasn't my favorite, but nonetheless, still really good. 5. Seem like the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face was a favorite by many reviewers, so it was a must try. As soon as it came out, you could smell the meat. It was topped off with a sunny side egg. There was a mix of fatty parts and tender meat. Make sure to break the yolk on top of the meat so it spreads around the meat, definitely was a good way to eat it!6. At this point, my sister and I already had a loadful, but that didn't stop us from finishing the rest of our order, which was the Confit Goat Belly. The goat was oh so savory, but it was the lobster and crab with the bourbon butter that made the dish. The perfect representation of a surf and turf. All the flavors in my mouth was craving for something light and sweet by the end of it, so we ended with a fruity dessert. 7. The Citrus Pavlova, yum yum! Ice cream served with a mix of blood orange, yuzu curd, kumquats, and a vanilla meringue. I couldn't get enough of this. It was absolutely scrumptious. The delightful taste of ice cream paired with fruits. My type of dessert!8. Now, because it was my birthday, I received a sampler of the Miso-Butterscotch Budino. What a gift! The taste of bacon toffee with glazed pineapple?! The combination of sweet and salty. My favorite topping of it all, was the candied cashews. Perfect end to a perfect birthday dinner!Now, it's no surprise that the food was great, but the service was just as wonderful! I'm not a huge fan of crowded restaurants, but I didn't mind it here. We were cared for very well. Waiters had great timing in switching out our plates, bringing water to the table, giving recommendations, and making sure we were enjoying our meal. To keep this in memory, my sister and I bought their T-shirts. ""When goats Fly""Definitely have to go back to Chicago to make a stop here again, an unforgettable dinner experience!"
"my friends and i are fatties (oink oink). during our girls' getaway weekend, of course we had to schedule a second dinner. what better place to go than girl & the goat?what i ate:- spring onion and ramp oil w/bread: so simple, but oh so tasty. the kind of thing you'd want to eat while polishing off bottles of wine with your friends- ham frites: thin crisp fries freckled with bits of ham. cheddar beer sauce?! come on! why would you not like this? only because the fries were so thin and little that i had difficulty cramming more into my mouth without sprinkling the table and my lap with a few errant fries. - oysters w/bacon: i'm usually not a fan of cooked oysters, but these were great. oysters were still tender and briny, and the bacon married well. gave it a nice smokey flavor. - roasted cauliflower: this was by far my favorite dish of the night. and this is coming from a carnivore (rarr). it was so deceptively simple, but it was packed full of flavor, spice, texture, umami. pickled peppers to give it a vinegary bite of heat, roasted pine nuts to give it crunch and richness, mint to keep it all fresh. i could eat this again and again and not get sick of it. - escargot ravioli: was not a fan of this. yea, i'm so not hip or cool, but escargot isn't my thing. too rubber like and chewy. the ravioli itself was tender, but... eh.. pass for me- goat confit w/lobster and crab: this was my second favorite dish. some of my friends weren't a fan of this, but i loved it's richness. the goat was toooo fork tender and delicious. you wouldn't think that lobster and crab would pair well with goat, but for me it did. it was an unexpected flavor combo. the butter just married everything together, and then you would get fresh bites of crunchy fennel. this was good, but if you're not a fan of super rich flavors, this may not be for you. - miso-butterscotch budino: this was surprising. the flavors were amazing. sweet, rich, and... some umami? this was rich and creamy. pros:- food was amazing treat. best to come with 2-3 other friends so you can order lots and share everythign- service was nice- decor: loved the way things were set up. plenty of wood- cocktails were interestingcons:- difficult to get a rez. we called a few weeks in advance, but the first time slot available was 10p. which worked out for my friends and i, since we made it our second dinner- can get pricey. it's mostly small plates, so you'll order quite a bit, and it'll add up. - parking can be hit or miss. would i come again? if i was in town, sure!"
"Everything was great.Great atmosphere and it was lively without being too loud. It was great for anyone going to dinner, girls night out, date night, or just catching up with a coworker. We were a group of 4 and everyone was super nice to us.What we ate.....Octopus: amazing and mix of onions, octopus, peppers, and etc made even the people who didn't eat seafood try it.Scallops - probably one of the best large scallops I have ever had. Perfectly cooked and seasoned.Chickapeas - this was not what i expected but was a pleasant surprise! it was eating clouds of tofu or something light. You would not have expected this from reading the description.Cauliflower - one of the best dishes that was full of flavor and the portion was huge.Beet salad - get this as a way to keep the dinner light as you will be eating a ton of salt and carbs I'm sure.Duck - the duck was very good and the portion was a lot larger than I expected.We also got a side of bread which was good, but not too memorable compared to the other food."
"For an extended wedding weekend in Chicago, one of my not-so-secret favorite cities (sorry, New York), Don M. and I decided we'd hit up one of the well esteemed restaurants this city has to offer. That alone wasn't an easy task, as I had recommendations to try many places and we were on semi short notice. What more can I say about this restaurant? We were excited to take our seats, even though our seats were at 10:15pm on a Sunday. What can I say, even with 2-3 weeks notice that was the only reservation available! Taking our seats was even harder than that, though-10:15pm on a Sunday it was packed like sardines, couples waiting ahead of us for what seemed like a while for their tables. We didn't get our seats until 10:45. Thank you for the free bread as a token of your apologies. I would've preferred the sparkling wine you brought to the couple beside us, but I won't complain too much.When finally sitting down, we were surprised to get a look at the menu-not many dishes over $15 on the whole thing. I was expecting to pay more, I'll put it that way. We were advised to go for about 2 dishes per person, and we did. Sticking to our pescetarian lifestyle, we chose the grilled octopus salad (sans ham), soft shell crab rice, ramp and rhubarb pierogies and the sesame shishito peppers. We enjoyed two cocktails with this meal, and we weren't really feeling like drinking more that night, though the wine list was nice. The standout dish for me was the sesame shishitos and soft shell crab. The crab was the smallest portion by a lot-one pan fried soft shell served on top of sticky rice-though it was delicious I wanted more of it. The shishitos were opposite; it was a huge crock of small delicious peppers. Usually, when I have a dish of shishito peppers, it comes with like, 9 peppers. There were dozens here. They were smothered in cheese and sesame and were amazing.We ended the night with cinnamon toast crunch rice pudding, again with rhubarb. There was so much rhubarb! I appreciated the ultra seasonal ingredients, but like 3 of the 5 dishes contained rhubarb. I guess they had a plethora of it that night.Overall, I did enjoy the meal, and once we were seated everyone was attentive and kind. I didn't enjoy waiting, standing next the the bar breathing over other diners for a half hour after our reservation time. I get that it's busy but it can get a bit unreasonable to continue taking reservations when you don't actually have the space or the staff. Coming from a city full of delicious food and fine dining, I feel like this experience just wouldn't be as acceptable in Philly. But I get that we're not in Philly. So be it."
"Wow just wow! Â There are no words to describe how much I loved this place and I'm not sure what I can say that the other reviews haven't said, however I'll give you my experience. Â Came here last weekend on a visit to Chicago with my hubs. Â It was on my must try list for Chicago. Â The only reservation I could snag was 10:15 PM on Sunday night, but hey I'll take it! Â We got there at 9:30 thinking we would grab a drink before dinner, but thankfully they were able to seat us early. Â We were somewhat worried about the veggie options at a restaurant with goat in the name, however there was a whole column of veggie dishes and even said they could alter some dishes to make them veggie friendly. Â Already off to a good start!What we orderedMain dishes:1. Â Honey sambal brioche-warm, soft, served with honey butter and this pico type thing; so good: Â Grade A +2. Â Chickpea fritters-served with garam masala, yogurt; by far our FAVORITE DISH: Grade A++3. Â Celery and cheddar root pierogies-stuffed with cheese and served with some cream; definitely good but not our favorite: Â Grade B+4. Â Pan fried shishito pepper-served with parmasan and miso on top; the BEST shishito peppers I've ever had, these are not your typical shishito pepper (1/2 order): Â Grade A+5. Â Roasted cauliflower-served with pickled pepper; this was definitely our least favorite though our waitress said it was her favorite and many others; we didn't like it: Â Grade CDesserts:1. Â Plantain cake-served with chocolate chip gelato: Â Grade A+2. Â Miso butterscotch budino-we got it minus the bacon toffee, but still amazing: Â Grade A+Our waitress (Leigh) who was awesome could tell we didn't like the cauliflower, thus took it away and off our bill! Â She was attentive and so sweet. Â Gave us great recommendations on food and continuously asked if we needed anything else. Â She also let us know that you can do half orders of everything including the desserts! Â This is a great way to try more stuff! Â Our bill for the two of us including two drinks was $78! Â Definitely better than anticipated! Â Stephanie Izard you are a genius! Â This place was amazing-the food, the ambience, and the service. Â This is a MUST TRY if you are in Chicago even if you have to eat at 11 PM! Â Tips:1. Â Get there early and they may be able to seat you sooner then expected or hang out at the bar and grab a drink.2. Â Try half orders of stuff!3. Â Make your reservations early.4. Â Enjoy this fabulous experience!"
"Finally tried this place couple of weeks ago and it was an experience that I never tried before. Â It was tasteful and cooked just right for your taste buds. Â The potion isn't huge like most restaurants these days but the amount they give you is enough for you to feel full. Â I guess it depends what you order. it's not one of those places where you feel like going to eat elsewhere after....that also depends on how big of an eater you are and this place is more classy. so if you like to eat burgers and fries, go elsewhere.The atmosphere is dim and loungy (mostly by the bar) but when you go sit, there is more lighting and a bright colored painting that goes with the name of the restaurant. Â The wooden theme is intriguing and goes very well with the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face meal.I attached some photos of few of our meals.."
"Service: 5Food: 4.5First off, we totally arrived an hour before our reservation because my watch was still set to PST. I realized this as we were sitting in a taxi from Michigan Ave. But we figured since we were there, we might as well see if we could be seated. The restaurant was already bustling and it was just before 6pm. I told the hostess what happened she managed to find a booth table tucked in the corned for the two of us - yay! (cause that would have been awkward if we had gotten turned away)The food is tapas style and our server recommend ~4 dishes for every two people. Of the dishes we ordered, by far the best ones were the chickpea fritters and miso-butterscotch budino (dessert). The cocktails were also really well made and worked well with the food. The other dishes, which I honestly can't remember much, were solid, but nothing too special - it's possible we didn't order the best dishes though. Chickpea fritters were stir fried with a few other veggies and looked a lot like cubes of fried tofu. The outsides were perfectly crisp and the insides had a smooth texture similar to mashed potatoes. It's really important to get an even mix of all the ingredients in each bit. I really liked the touch of bean sprouts and the full chickpeas. Overall, the flavors and textures in the dishes were well thought out and paired. My favorite was dessert. The budino was similar to a bread pudding with many more textures. In each bite you had spongy cake, glazed pineapple, creamy pudding, crunchy toffee pieces and finally some fresh cream. Uh... how does that not seem amazing?! I didn't really notice the miso taste anywhere, but the dish was fabulous. While we didn't have anything to complain about with our food, our server did offer complimentary dishes to the tables next to us. In one case, the couple found a hair in a dish. The woman thought it was hers, but the waiter still said he wouldn't charge for it. In the second case, when the waiter came to check on them, a table of three mentioned that they really didn't enjoy the roasted beets. At that point, he just apologized and said he would comp it. Now I wouldn't suggest using these as ways to get free food, but it's a great sign that they really care for their customer's experiences."
"When I was planning my trip to Chiacgo, I obviously started going through Yelp to find places to try in Chi-Town and G&G came up in the results over and over again, I mean look at the freaking reviews! And when I found out that reservations are usually made months in advance and I managed to score one in a few weeks, I was thrilled! I was hell-bent on making it there no matter what the weather ;) Our reservation was at 9, we got there at 8.45ish. While we were waiting for our table, we got drinks. Lux Goods is an absolute must have if you like infused cocktails. The chamomile and masala work so well together with the gin, I don't like gin otherwise but the chamomile and masala caught my attention and I decided to go for it, and boy was I happy I made that choice. Seating - Ok, so this was a little weird, the two of us were seated on the tables by the wall and the tables were so close together that it WAS a communal dinner, no two ways about it. We dined with the two parties sitting beside us and clearly were part of their conversations and them ours. The party on our left (three chatty women) left very little unsaid, we now know all about how one friend of theirs is going through a tough time making ends meets on her meagre Â salary and other things that I won't bore you with, but one word -TMI. We lucked out and the party on our right was an old couple who only spoke to each other to decide who will take the last bite, but I'm assuming they heard our conversation and are probably TMIng us ;) So, long story short, if you are thinking date night or intimate dinner and are seated here, good luck. Service was great. The hostess was great; our Server was great, nothing to nitpick here at all.Food - So food is where I am a little torn, the dishes that we ordered were on either ends of the spectrum, things that were great were great and things that were just plain meh and did not work at all. Good things first, the goat neck. I grew up eating goat meat and it is in fact my favorite meat of all time, so it was a no brainer for me to try the goat here. If I could, I would order all the goat preparations but I decided to do the best of the cuts, the goat neck. The goat neck at G&G was fall off the bone goodness, it was perfectly seasoned, the outside was crispy and the inside was cooked to perfection and soft. It is a sizeable portion too! This one made it back with me for lunch the next day. The best $32 I have ever spent.Chickpea fritters - I thought the fritters itself were incredibly soft, pillowy, cheesy, and light all at the same time. The embellishments under the fritters though, were a tad bit salty, the yogurt, tamarind and other things were a little much. I would still order this one for its uniqueness.Grilled Cuttlefish - Least favorite. The cuttle fish was cooked perfectly but there was just too much soy sauce in this dish and the lab though tasty by itself got overpowered by the soy it was floating in.Tomorrow's crouton - regular sourdough, I have had better.$80ish for the entire meal excluding drinks (if you care). If I am back in town, I might go in a larger group, to try more dishes."
"Wow. Â What an incredible culinary experience. Â It's very rare when every dish you try leaves you speechless and is seared into your memory. Â That was the case here. Â Great service, coupled with a relaxed yet lively atmosphere make this just about a perfect spot.We tried the following:Pig's face - incredibly succulent, melting in your mouth perfection of meat, egg and potato crunchies...Fries - thin yet soft and crunchy, with bacon bits and two great dips.Hamachi - outstanding combination of ingredients and flavors. Perfect yellowtail (nice cold temperature), chunks of bacon and light sauce. Chickpea fritters - little cubes of perfection. Â Don't know what kind of crack they put in the chickpeas here but this tasted like a rich cheese not chickpeas. Â With a number of little taste explosions surrounding it. Â Goat empanadas - phenomenal dish. Â Everyone has had empanadas but these were a notch or two or three above. Â Incredible.Halibut - wow. Â Truly memorable. Â Trumpet mushrooms, great sauce, perfectly prepared fish.Escapist ravioli - this was probably the only dish that didn't knock our socks off, but was still darn good. Â Just a little too al dente for my taste.Duck tongues - really creative and very tasty dish. Highly recommended!One of the top restaurants in the US as far just sheer quality of food. Â Phenomenal. Â If you can, (need foresight to make a reservation 2-3 months ahead of time) you gotta come here."
"Amazing food, but you already know that. Just want to give a shout out to the staff (especially Justin), they are so friendly and knowledgeable and full of cool stories. Highly recommend eating at the bar and making some new friends. PS try the halibut"
"Not sure what the hype is around G&G... maybe I should've gone closer to launch? I'm glad it's getting people interested into the food scene, but it's a one and done type place for me.Maybe it was an off day, the meal started great but once we hit the proteins it was salt overload. Between the three of us we sampled about $180 worth of items on the menu (no alcohol, just food). I'm not that big of a fan of Avec either but I would much rather drop $50+pp over there... Senza and The Lobby will be around the same price and you'll leave much more satisfied."
"I was visiting Chicago with family for my aunt's birthday and we decided that this was a must see. The food was delicious and plate changes were quick. My favorites were*goat belly confit*pork shank*diver scallopsBut even more amazing than the food was the staff! Our server Pete was so awesome! Another server accidentally knocked over our bottle of wine, James the manager came over and replaced it on them- how cool is that?!? such a great staff and delicious food. Â Will definitely be back when I'm in Chicago again. A fantastic dining experience!!"
"Food: Â 4.5 starsService: 3.5 starsGirl & the Goat has been the one ubiquitously recommended restaurant among people I know in Chicago.I made a pretty last minute (which in G&G terms is 2 weeks in advance) reservation for 2 at 8:45 on a Tuesday night. The place was packed from the time we arrived to the time we left (around 10:00 PM), and, like other reviewers said, it's very loud. There was not a seat to be found throughout the entire place. We were seated at a counter in front of the cooks and expo folks. My boyfriend really enjoyed this. I did not like it (I was hesitant openly and orgasmically shove food into my face in front of several complete strangers), but the cooks and expo people were very friendly and informative. At times, they were a little too chatty. It almost felt like we were part of the kitchen, rather than guests. I would not want to sit at that spot again, but I recognize that some people would really enjoy it.It took forever for our waiter to arrive, and he greeted a large party, which sat after us, before he greeted us. I am aware that it is a hoppin' place, but he did not drop by and say ""Hello,"" for a solid 20 minutes. The rest of the night kind of proceeded like that. The line staff seemed to go out of the way to be friendly, but at times it bordered on intrusive rather than welcoming (our waiter, who disappeared for long bouts of time, literally popped up behind us and came between us to stir our food up; I know he assisting us, but it was a little weird). So the service was not great, but the food....THE FOOD (which, really, that's what we were there for):We ordered the Pig Face, Grilled Ramp Marinated Shrimp, Goat Empanadas, Â raw oysters, and Miso Butter-Scotch Budino. We also ordered the La Paloma and the rum/chili drinks, which were excellent. Almost all of the food had a fairly vinegar-y taste, which I like. The dishes were all savory and had a little salty/vinegar-y kick to them. Two favorites I want to highlight: - The Pig Face (don't worry; there isn't anything gross or weird looking hiding under that egg; just crispy pork deliciousness). This was the dish our waiter stirred and cut up for us (again weird...but he was trying to mix up the sauce, meat, and egg). All my favorite breakfast flavors together: savory pork, egg, and sweet maple. Yum.-The Miso Butter-Scotch Budino was incredible! I had no idea what we ordered, but trust in G&G. This was a dense butterscotch pudding/flan bed covered with bits of toffee, pineapple, sponge cake, and whip cream. I would go back to get this alone. I bet it would be wonderful with coffee. I would definitely recommend G&G. If I make it back, I hope to sit in a different spot, and I will update if the service experience is a little better than."
"Finally decided to make reservations and try this place. First, it took me 3 months in advance to make reservations for a Sunday at 4:45pm. Regardless, this is a great dinner time for us! The hostess tried to seat us at a small table with no room for my tall, tall husband and when asked to be reseated, she did have some attitude issues.Otherwise, the service was impeccable! The waiter was smiling, full of recommendations and advice and not pushy at all. There was even a gentleman filling our water glasses constantly and bringing clean plates! The foods was fantastic...even the veggie options were delicious. We tried the cauliflower and corn perogie, both yummy. The broccoli had a flavor that I was not a fan of. Husband tried the octopus and ribs which he loved. The pudding desert was a great combo of sweet and savory! Great experience overall"
"I have to say that I expected more. The food and drinks were good, but not great.I tried to make a reservation for a table, but the earliest they had was 10:30pm on a Tuesday, so we just went at 5 and grabbed a seat at the bar. Luckily we got there when we did because by 5:30 all the seats were gone and there seemed to be a long wait.Food: We ordered 2 veggie dishes which we got as 1/2 portions - string beans and shishito peppers: the peppers were great, the beans not so much, 1 fish dish (octopus) - pretty good, though they are a bit stingy with the octopus, 1 meat dish (tongue) - the meat was lost in the salad, but it was good, 2 goat dishes (goat liver mousse, goat belly) - if you were to get only 1 dish, i would get the goat belly with lobster and crab1 dessert - butterscotch cake with pineapples, pretty good.all in all, a fun experience but I'd rather go to Purple Pig than here"
"This has to be on my list while I'm in Chicago! And it did not disappointed. We came on a Monday without a reservation at 5pm. Thank God, NO WAIT! We started with roasted cauliflower. It was delicious!!!!!! It turned the non-cauliflower-eating-me to eating almost half of the dish. We also had the grilled baby octopus. It was so good I almost wanna get another order and take it on the plane with me. The mix of different flavors in the dish makes it very interesting and refreshing. And they were not cheap about the octopus. We then share the very popular dish the pig face. I don't think I can describe this dish. We finished the whole thing within 5 mins. So there.....I really love this place not only because of the food, it's also the unpretentious environment (thanks to the cute decor and friendly staff) and the generous portion of the food. I definitely need to come back here for many more times whenever I am in CHI town again!"
"We sat at the bar. We shared several dishes. everything is small portions. Goat empanadas (fair)Chickpea fritters - unusual, very interesting. Halibut - this was the best of our dishes. Oysters - I like oysters - not my favorite but def fresh.Beef shank - this was my least favorite. Hard to eat off of the small plate. Very fatty. Shoshito peppers - these were tasty, very interesting. There are a ton of restaurants - I would try a diff place. Â  Service at the bar was quick and friendly."
"After weeks of anticipation for this meal, pouring through reviews, and drooling over fellow yelper's pics, I am sad to say I left feeling a tad disappointed. There's no arguing that Girl and the Goat serves delicious and innovative food. It just wasn't mind-numbing, earth-shatteringly good as I was expecting. And I had very high expectations. The three of us came to eat at 9pm on a Thursday night. Boy, was it packed and loud! The restaurant itself has a cool trendy ambiance. The open kitchen is impressive! Booze: great selection of wines and cocktails. The Lux Goods (gin, chamomile-masala syrup, lemon) was freakin' delicious. The masala syrup tasted like the chaat masala my mom would sprinkle on potatoes for Sunday morning lunch, ah the memories. Honey sambal brioche: WOW. just wow. I never would've thought the cheapest item of the night ($4) would be my favorite. But seriously, this brioche was the some of the best carbs I've ever sunk my greedy teeth into. The bread came with honey butter and a zesty pomelo relish - both went perfectly with the flavorful, soft, warm, bread. Grilled pork belly: I love everything pork belly, and this dish was no exception. The portion was generous and the meat was cooked perfectly. The green chutney-like sauce was a great accompaniment. Goat empanadas: Loved 'em! The empanada crusts were cooked perfectly and the goat was super tender and flavorful. My only complaint is that there were only two empanadas, and I could've eaten at least eight, hehe. Grilled baby octopus: I think we made a mistake by ordering two grilled dishes. The octopus was cooked alright (a bit too chewy) and the pistachios were a sassy innovative addition. The lemon vinaigrette was delicate and simple. The dish overall just didn't have much flavor. This was probably my least favorite of the night. The Pig Face: ah, the Pig Face. It might've been because I was already stuffed and this dish came out last, but, the elusive, famous Pig Face disappointed me. I feel like such a party pooper for saying that after a slew of praise in previous reviews, but it's true. No denying, it was good. Just not wow. The meat is definitely fatty, but I was okay with that. It just wasn't as exciting as I thought it would be.Bittersweet chocolate: a satisfyingly bitter thin biscuit-like cake served with shiitake-caramel gelato and toffee crÃ¨me frÃ¢iche. Another hit of the night. I couldn't taste the shiitake but the gelato was lovely. Â Service: good, but nothing worth raving about. Our server was friendly and helpful, but Â was hard to get a hold of whenever we needed something. The three of us ended up paying about $40 each, which is pretty reasonable considering it was a lot of food (plus two drinks). Overall, we left full and satisfied, but not blown away. Presentation however was lovely. Regardless, I could be convinced to return to try their other seafood and goat dishes (one of my dining partners isn't the most adventurous).*Tip: ask to sit at the chef's table if you're a party of two - I hear it's a ton of fun!"
"Enjoyed it but I think it is a little overhyped. The two dishes that stood out for me were the cauliflower and the pork shank. I wasn't too crazy about the pig face as it was a bit too fatty. All in all, food was good all around but I don't know if I would need to one back for it. Everything was very heavy and rich so finite key felt weighed down afterwards.The service could also be why I am not giving G&TG a higher rating. This restaurant is SO damn busy. I mean, people are waiting in line to try and get in here and practically sardined into the bar. We were seated at a booth facing the bar but there were tables alongside it and people were just draped over the bar! How could anyone enjoy their food with people breathing on it??For a place that's so hyped, the service shouldn't be neglected. Yes people are clamoring to get in (for now) but with all shiny new things, something bigger and better always comes along. Â Also another thing to keep in mind, reservations need to be made at least 2-3 months in advance."
"The food here is certainly creative and unique, but what really sets this place apart is the service. Per our server's suggestion, we ordered an array of dishes to share. He didn't just say, ""try these three""-- he asked us questions about our preferences and then gave incredibly specific and detailed recommendations, answering every imaginable question we had. In the whole, the food was definitely better than most restaurants, but it didn't always seem worth the price. The cauliflower was among my personal favorites, but the special when we were there, a goat tenderloin for nearly $30, came out with 4-5 thin slices about an inch in diameter. I'd probably go back, but I've got enough other places in Chicago that I still want to try, so it's not at the top of my priorities."
"What an amazing dinner.For 2 people, we ordered:-1/2 order of green beans-halibut-pork belly-pork face with egg-black cod-brioche with jams-complimentary serving of dessert (butterscotch pudding, i believe?)Our absolute favorite was the halibut, which is apparently the very dish the chef created to win Top Chef. The dish had a lot of asian influences--fish sauce, citrus notes--and was perfect. I was so sad when it was gone. Green beans were okay, but were nice to have as we waited for our dishes to be served. *I have to say that service was great--dishes came out with perfect timing (as soon as we finished the prior dish) and were saved from lightest to heaviest. Waters were always refilled.*Black cod was okay. Very intricate in its usage of various ingredients but compared to the halibut, it was a bit bland.Pork belly was my least favorite. The pork seemed a bit burnt and charred in some areas which left bitter notes in my mouth.We ordered the pork belly with egg based on reviews on Yelp. It was a good plate, but was much sweeter than we expected. If the sweetness level was reduced, it would have been a much better dish overall. I could only manage a few bites. Lastly, the brioche was wonderful--light, buttery--and the free dessert was the perfect palate cleanser. We had also ordered a bottle of wine to accompany the meal, and it was a great recommendation from our waitress--Bravo! Definitely a pricey meal--around $180 for 2 people but worth it, personally, due to the quality of food and service. The decor was nice but dark and the tables were very close together. The noise level was really high too; I could barely hear across the table.Great dining experience--would come again to try the other offerings."
"After menu-stalking Girl & the Goat for literally years, I was finally lucky enough to dine here thanks to my amazing boyfriend. We had a reservation for 8:30 on a Friday, which was made a month in advance. We waited between the bar and hostess stand for about fifteen minutes for our table to open up. It was very busy, so we felt a little bit awkward and in the way as servers walked by with trays of food. The hostess who seated us identified us and said, ""Hi, David, your table is ready,"" which was a nice touch. We came hungry and were ready to begin our meal! We waited for maybe ~five more minutes before our water glasses were filled and our server arrived. Our server recommended we order 2-3 dishes each. We decided to forego drinks in lieu of ordering more food (we love to eat!). We ordered six dishes at once and then the kitchen decided which courses should be brought out in what order/combination. Roasted cauliflower. I've had this veggie menu item in the back of my head for years after reading a delicious description by Candice G., our former Yelp Chicago 'burbs CM. The dish definitely lived up to my expectations! The pickled peppers definitely gave the dish a bit of a kick, but I still consumed it easily (and I'm a heat-averse person). The mint and pine nuts also worked really well with the big chunks of cauliflower. Chickpea fritters. My boyfriend remarked that the fritters were basically like ""fried hummus"" and he meant that in the best possible way. The fritters were like eating clouds--so smooth and light! The yogurt, garam masala, rosemary, and green mango worked magnificently. I would definitely order this dish again. Grilled baby octopus. This was a great dish, but by the time it arrived, I was already almost full from half of the previous two dishes! We got most of it to-go so we could still at least sample the rest of our meal. My only complaint about this dish was that the octopus was a little chewier than I prefer and it was a little overly-salty. Still a great dish, though! I thought there was a pretty liberal amount of octopus (other reviews complained about there not being enough).Sauteed green beans. My boyfriend was underwhelmed by this dish and we agreed it could have used more cashews. The fish sauce wasn't fishy at all, which was excellent. Even though it was slightly saltier than I prefer, it was still the best green bean dish I've ever had. We took most of this home for leftovers!Ham frites. The fries were pretty standard in the best way--fairly skinny and not overly crispy or oily. They were covered in what reminded me of a cross between a bacon crumble and fine dust. The ham dust liberally topped the fries and the tomato aioli plus cheddar beer dipping sauces were exquisite. They were very rich. Wood oven-roasted pig face. This signature G&G dish was a must, so I tried a bite even though I don't eat meat! The sunny-side egg was cooked to absolute perfection. My boyfriend remarked that it was really fatty, which could be interpreted as ""either the best thing in the world or the worst thing in the world."" It was really, really tasty. The cilantro and red wine-maple were smeared decoratively on the plate.Miso-butterscotch budino. We were absolutely stuffed by this point, but there was no way we were leaving without trying a G&G dessert. We went with this dessert on the recommendation from our waitress and we didn't know what to expect. (What is a budino?) I still can't really explain it, but it was really great. You can't go wrong with candied cashews! Overall, this was a really fantastic experience. Some of these bites were simply magical! My only complaint was that there was too much food. Three dishes per person is DEFINITELY way too much. I recommend ordering four dishes total for two people, plus dessert; that would be the sweet spot. Portions are pretty generous. I felt like we got great value for the food + cost. Customer service felt a little off originally because no one acknowledged or apologized for our table being 15 minutes late past the reservation. That being said, even that wasn't enough for me to bump G&G down a star. This is a really fine establishment with mouth-watering food!"
One of the best restaurants I've been to! The food was amazing and the service was just as stellar.
"This was the best meal I ate during my 5 day stay in Chicago! All of my friends from California highly recommended this place out and said the food was just to die for. Luckily we were able to get reservations for a table of 7 and our whole party really enjoyed every bit of our meal. For 7 people we ordered 9 dishes and it was definitely enough to share. There was so much variety on the menu, and I just wanted to try them all! My absolute favorite was the Goat Neck ($36), Pork Belly, Pig Face, Short Ribs, & the Green Beans. I really recommend ordering a goat dish while visiting this restaurant, since it is their speciality. They purchase their goat from a local farm and everything is just really fresh and tender! The meat falls off the bone so easily and every bite is delightful! All in all, everything we ordered was delicious and really worth trying! All the dishes had a unique twist to it that might sound odd at first, but somehow it just goes together magically. I really recommend visiting this place if you're ever in the Chicago area. I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place and it definitely has a romantic setting. Great place to bond and enjoy some great food with it! I will definitely come back when I visit Chicago again. Hopefully soon!"
"Everything here is delicious but a bit on the salty side, still DELICIOUS. I was visiting chicago and my friend made reservations 2 months in advance for a Sunday at 9:30pm for three people. The place was PACKED!!! I think it is always super busy here so make reservations way ahead of time. Decor is super nice and I liked the vibe here.It's tapas style so you share with everyone. We got 6 dishes between 3 people...I was SO stuffed but I kept eating. Left here with massive food coma. We got the following:pan fried shishito peppers- Comes with a bunch of shishito peppers (a little spicy but not too much) covered in parmesan cheese. Very rich and filling.nantucket bay scallops- LOVE this dish!!! The scallops melt in your mouth and there's a hint of pesto flavor. Mushrooms are to die for. goat carpaccio- smokedâ trout roe, thinly sliced with fried capers - amazing!!!wood oven roasted pig face-slices of pig meat with a sunny side egg on top. you mash everything together and cut into pieces- SO GOOD. Meat is on the fatty side so I LOVED itttttt!!! Flavor was amazing. roasted cauliflower- I don't like vegetables but I loved this!!! The nuts and cheese just are perfect on top of the cauliflower- Decent amount and super rich!sugo-pappardelle. Rosemary. Cape gooseberrie. The pappardelle pasta is really good mixed with the meat. Loved this dish too. Overall, the dishes were amazing! The cauliflower, sugo, and shishito peppers were on the heavy side- just a warning. Definitely lived up to its name."
"This was the best meal I've ever had. Period. It beat out Mozza and Bestia in Los Angeles. It's rare to find a fancy restaurant that can be inventive (i.e. not be Italian or steakhouse) but still appeal to the masses. Everything on this menu is creative and full of shocking flavor but doesn't leave you surprised or curious. You won't think: Oh! that was good but not sure I would have it again. Instead you'll scream: That was amazing and I want MORE. The portions are generous and the pricing is so on point. I wish they had appealing cocktails but wine is probably best so it doesn't interrupt the array of flavors you'll encounter. We got the blueberry goat cheese empanadas, the lamb shank, the halibut with almond butter, the sugo. ALL were amazing but we couldn't finish the last course (lamb shank) because we were stuffed. I honestly don't think you could go wrong here, ordering blindly. We sat at the communal table but didn't mind. Everyone there was so happy because they were also probably eating the best meal of their lives. The communal experience actually amplified the funness of the night! PS We came at opening time on Saturday and put our name on the list and went across the street for happy hour. It worked well and our wait was less than an hour."
"-PIG FACE -STRING BEANS-ESCARGOT RAVIOLIOne of my close girlfriends and I planned a trip to Chicago and were told many times that we MUST try Girl and The Goat. Thank god they did because the food is to die for! The only reason I did not want to give 5 stars is because the hostess was not the friendliest of sorts, she was sort of snooty to say the least. So it was off putting...BUT our server was the nicest and the food.... omg i cannot rave enough about it! For being two small girls, our server was shocked at the amount of food we ordered. haha we ordered the pig face, oysters, sautÃ©ed string beans, escargot ravioli, crisp braised pork shank, i believe it was goat belly?, and an amazing dessert which i cannot remember the name, but i do have a photo!!! Btw, we finished all of it... haha Although we only ordered the goat dish because we felt inclined to since its called Girl and The Goat. I am not a fan of gamey meats like lamb, so goat was not my favorite, but my friend enjoyed it. It is too bad that this place isn't closer to us, since I am from Santa Monica because i would probably be here once a week. MUST TRY!!!! be sure to make reservations in advanced"
"As you know, I rarely, rarely give 5 stars. Â This is unhesitatingly one of the best restaurants in the city, if not, THE best. Â  it gets a lot of hype....IT'S ALL TRUE, ALL DESERVED!The atmosphere is understated for the cuisine you are about to enjoy, and that's a good thing. Â It's casually dark, relaxed, but not sloppy and always busy.The food...ohhhh the food! Â I've been there three times and the best dish I've ever eaten is the calamari bruschetta. Â Now, everyone's doing bruschetta, it's like the twice baked potato of the 90's. Â And if you've had REAL bruschetta in Italy, it is simple and fresh so most restaurants make them like mini-pizzas. Â This isn't typical Italian bruschetta, but I believe it is in the ""hermeneutic of continuity"" in my not-so-humble opinion. Â The toast is cut to the perfect thickness, and toasted just right, crunch on the outside, slightly chewy and warm on the inside. Â It is topped by their goat cheese spread concoction with calamari laid gently on top. Â  Now calamari is difficult to prepare when it's not fried and this is either grilled or baked on-stove I believe. Â This is why they're the best restaurant in Chicago, it came out perfect, not chewy (overcooked) and not slimy (undercooked and/or not fresh)...just right. Â The taste combinations were incredible in this dish and my friend and I both would have preferred to leave the restaurant with this as the last thing we tasted. Â All the other dishes were exceptional as well. Â I won't go through all of them, but let me say a few things:The chickpea fritter: My friend wanted to order this and I simply didn't want to come to a place like this for a fritter. I acquiesced. Â Let me say, AH-MAZING! Â It was out of this world fantastic. Â This also is placed in my ""Who'd a thunk?"" category! How could such a thing could taste so incredible? Â Only at the Girl and the Goat. The confit goat belly: Â Another MUST HAVE. Â You'll never have anything like it, anywhere else. Â When finished with it, I recommend picking up the dish and licking it, it's well worth the humiliation and stares it will ensue from others. Â Finally, if you can, ask to be sat in Â Kelly's section. Â She is exceptional, I've had her twice and she never ceases to be in a good mood, helpful with recommendations, and genuinely happy about taking care of you. Â Her attitude is amazing. Â She's got a smile that would light up Chicago. Â She's a rare asset in any industry, much less the service industry. Â If I were a younger man, I'd marry her."
"I concur with everyone who has reviewed the food. It's inventive and delicious. What I think is stellar at Girl & the Goat is the gracious and genuine service. From being greeted, served and saying goodbye, we felt incredibly appreciated. This is a restaurant that has up to a 2 month wait and could so easily become complacent. I looked for a reservation at the last minute hoping for a miracle and was overjoyed to find a table for 4. When I expressed our surprise, the restaurant let us know a table of 10 had cancelled so we were seated with another group at a large table (they were also delightful). What I loved was that the staff shared in our thrill of getting a table! Even though the restaurant was packed, our waiter (adorable!) and all of the serving staff were attentive, knowledgeable and fun. We were on vacation but would definitely return to Girl & the Goat on a next trip."
"Everything here is delicious. Best meal we had in Chicago. The wait is normally really long, so try to make reservations!Girl & the Goat is actually easily accessible from downtown via bus or train, so I had no problems getting here as a visitor.We ordered:- Hamachi Crudo: This is essentially sashimi and the crispy pork belly actually complemented really well! - Escargot Ravioli: I was hesitant about this dish since I'm not a fan of escargot, but oh my god, the tamarind-miso sauce is to die for.- Country fried loup de mer: I really liked all the sides that this came with. I'm a huge fan of sweet and sour, which totally made the dish. - Wood oven roasted pig face: Highly recommended as well. It sounds like a strange dish, but it actually is quite normal.- Confit goat belly: This was probably one of our favorite dishes. We loved the bourbon butter and lobster and crab. There is surprisingly a lot of lobster and crab that comes with the belly!- Miso-butterscotch budino: Best budino I have ever had. The bacon toffee and candied cashews are so delicious, I want a second one!Highly highly recommended for everyone."
"Summary: What I enjoyed most about each dish is its complexity and perfect balance of different textures and flavors. The chef did not let us down on any dish and we had a lot for two people! Highly recommend.Detailed review below. We made a reservation for three a week ago via Open Table for our trip to Chicago from PDX.They called us two days prior to confirm our reservation which we did and asked for a high chair as we would be bringing a baby as our third and the girl on the phone happily said no problem.Upon arriving at 5:45, the restaurant was packed and bustling with music and chatter of all the customers. This was my third day in Chicago and I gotta say coming from Portland I think I'm spoiled with food because nothing has really impressed me so far but is the place I was waiting for!We were seated very quickly to a perfect corner booth table for the three of us and none of the staff looked annoyed by our baby and in fact were all very friendly and smiling to her. Water came quickly as did menus, we glanced over all the yummy options and made or choices. Miso Hungry (bread rolls with pepper butter and jam), green garlic pierogies, grilled baby octopus, wood oven roasted pig face, and goat liver mousse. Our server Calvin was SOOO awesome. He told us that a few of our choices were very rich and recommend we switch a few things so we switched the roasted pig face and liver mousse to the Pork Shank and goat belly. He said that the mousse is so rich that it's usually something people come in for happy hour and just share one plate. Â His choices were perfect but by the time the pork shank arrived I could only eat a 1/4 of it as we were stuffed.Dessert we had the date cake and that was bliss as well. This restaurant meets and exceeds its reviews and the staff and hospitality were all at or above expectations.I highly recommend this restaurant if you are coming to Chicago."
"Reputation of G & the G is very well deserved! Â They had to be phenomenal if I couldn't get a reservation until July, right?!! Â We swooped in at 5 o'clock, and they were able to squeeze us in, but gave us a 2 hour time limit, which I was totally fine with. Â Very interesting they have small tables, but also large community tables, which I don't know why more restaurants employ this act. Â It made for a friendly dining experience, plus you get to see what everybody else orders without looking all creepy! I swear I don't do that...Servers were beyond friendly, helping us out, stating it is family style, and an enjoyable experience. We did not have any dishes with goat in it, but we had quite the plentiful array of food. Started with a simple multi-grain bread, but it came with a very tasty cream cheese type spread, which if I had it my way, I would slather all over other things like... more bread or a bagel. Next was the grilled ramp marinated shrimp, grilled baby octopus, which were just all-around delights. Â The octopus had the grilled crust and flavor, but nice and chewy in a lemon vinaigrette with pistachios and other little tidbits that kind of got lost. Â The shrimp was perfectly cooked, but since I enjoyed the octopus so much I forgot what the shrimp came with other than a slight kick. Â I love me some pork belly, so I was excited for their take on it. Â I was sadly disappointed with it. Â It was really good, but it didn't wow me. Â It was different with some kind of green sauce (avocado and cilantro puree? that wasn't very flavorful), and some blackberries. Â The skin was crispy but the pork meat of it was a little overcooked rather than melt in your mouth. If you like pork belly, I would still consider ordering it.But the next two dishes were probably the most popular among all patrons because it seemed like I saw them bring out these dishes every few minutes. Â My wife loves green beans, so if it's on any menu we usually order them, and they were really good! Â Simple, yet very plentiful so I can see why so many order it. Â The menu says sauteed, but there were some grill marks or some blackening on the tender beans that were cooked in a fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews. Â I have to experiment to make this for us, it was that good! Â Not overly salty since it was fish sauce, it made for a nice side dish. Â But my favorite dish was the wood oven roasted pig face. Â What the what? Â No, it's not lord of the flies kind of thing. Â It was beautiful! Â My wife makes fun of me when I say you can make any dish good if you put a fried egg on it, but this really made the dish THAT much better! Big plate, loads of crispy pig face goodness with a tamarind sauce, cilantro, red wine maple sauce, and potato stix. Â Just cut that sexy egg yolk and let the music begin! Â The egg adds a richness to go with everything and just made me a happy camper.We finished our meal with the miso-butterscotch budino with bacon toffe, glazed pineapple and candied cashews. Â It was like a creme brulee, which really doesn't give it justice. Â It was slap yo mama good! I didn't want to share!This was one of the best meals I've ever had, and I won't hesitate to come back to Chicago. But bring that credit card, getting this many dishes plus drinks was quite a bill, but worth every penny!"
"Wow, I couldn't understand why you have to make reservations like a month in advance for this restaurant. Â Until I had the food. Â I know there is a God to create such wonderful food, do you hear me?! Â Everything I had was to die for. Â And our waiter? Â He was one of the best waiters I have ever had. Â I always request him because he goes over and beyond to make your dining experience a superb one. Â Can't wait to go back. Â And yes, the pictures speak for themselves. Â Enjoy! (I know I did!)"
"This is an excellent restaurant. One of the best I've been to. Pork face was crispy and beautifully sauced. The egg on top melded perfectly with the pork and sauces to form an excellent bite. Great selection of cocktails. My wife went for more of the spirit forward, bourbon type drinks and I went for some lemony gin drinks considered the hot day. Only problem was sitting next to some loud obnoxious New Yorkers, but ah well, can't have everything in life.We didn't have a reservation and were trying to get there and eat quickly before a flight. We showed up 5 minutes before opening, were seated immediately, and service was very quick."
"Truth is... as a foodie... I was overwhelmed. Â Just blown away. Â The whole thing was an amazing experience.There's lots of reviews (almost 4000) to figure out what you need to know... here's what I want you to know:It's a little cramped, but if you have any personality, you can make friends... which makes it fun and intimate. Â The food comes out in courses... one at a time... so sit back, enjoy a drink, and enjoy the experience. Â It's going to take an hour or two! Â Speaking of which... the HEAVEN drink was exactly that!Reservations apparently have to be made at least a few weeks out in order to have a chance at dining here, but you can use rezhound like we did... and got good seats near the kitchen so I could watch the magic! What can I say... Stephanie has it figured out! Â 5 STARS across the board!"
Met with a business collea
"Came here for appetizers before dinner elsewhere. Reservations are definitely recommended, but if you get there right when it opens, they'll take walk-ins (around 4:30p-5p). We sat at the communal table next to the kitchen. Great seat to people watch. 1. Raw Kumamoto- I love raw oysters. I would have ordered 5 more just for myself if we were eating dinner here. The mignonette sauce that comes already dressed on it...mmmmmm. perfect. 2. Duck tongues, are fried and delicious! Perfect pairing with the poke and beans! Â 3. Green beans- I didn't take a picture of this and my friend says, ""you're totally going to regret not taking a picture."" Uh...it's green beans. All good. And....as soon as I take a bite. Green beans with the sauce that it comes with, holy crap. Best green beans I've had! And...yeah, as we devoured all of it, I wish I would have taken a photo. lol4. Marinated shrimp with snap peas. Kind of a disappointment compared to all the other plates. Pretty average. Nothing that sticks out."
"Tips - book about 2 months ahead to get a table. Check last minute - reservations may open up. We were lucky and got 11:30pm reservations on a Saturday night by booking same day. Â The restaurant is beautiful and food was delicious. Our table of four ordered Kolrabi Salad, chickpea fritter, duck tongues, wood oven roasted pig face, goat empanadas, and a clam dish with basil pesto, watercress, and toast with liver mousse. Â For dessert, we shared the miso butterscotch budino. My favorite of these were the clams, duck tongue, pig face, and the miso butterscotch budino. Â The other dishes were good but wouldn't be considered must orders for me considering that there are so many other good options on the menu. We were not super hungry because the 11:30 pm dinner was the fourth meal for the day. Since we were not as hungry, 6 dishes plus dessert were enough for us. The total cost without drinks and alcohol was $110.00."
"What a great place!Fellow Yelpers indicated that showing up before the restaurant open and waiting in line to get in was the only option to get into that local sensation restaurant. They were right!!! We showed up at 4:15pm, waited in line until the restaurant opened at 4:30 promptly and immediately got in! Some people ahead of us were trying to get a table, slowing down the process, but once we understood the bar was indeed first come first serve, we grabbed two stools and happily sat at the bar counter. I thought it was ridiculous for people to start dinner at 4:30pm, but once we decided to shift to a late lunch, it gave us an excellent reason to venture out and try that supposed ""must"" in the Chicago restaurant scene. We were not disappointed. They serve the full menu at the bar. And you get your drinks (very good BTW) much faster there too! They have an impressive collection of beers for those who like ale! Food was everything the other reviews say. Very original and really good. My favorites were the chickpea fritters (totally random but oh-so-yummy!), the goat empanadas (which I wasn't sure they'd be a big deal when we ordered, and boy I am happy I was wrong!) and the goat neck with its quinoa tabouli. They tell you everything is meant to be shared. True. But a word of caution on the goat neck: it is humongous. For 4 (or more!) people to share (not 2 as we were told). It's just a large large larrrrrge portion. Of deliciousness that is. The meat was incredibly tender, seasoned to perfection and the accompaniments made the whole thing be a feast for your tastebuds. Just waaaay too large of a portion. It seemed wasteful. And that's why I took away one star. Well that and the having to book weeks in advance to get a table at a regular dinner time. It's just silly."
"We were visiting from Toronto and made reservations - 10:45pm was the only slot but it was worth it!! We were seated at the Chef's table right at the kitchen. It was a little warm, but a fun experience to watch them cook. Â Our server was excellent and even gave us dessert on the house when we were too full to order any. Â She just wanted us to try it, since we were from out of town and probably wouldn't get a chance to come back. Â Thank god for her, as I think I can say it was the most delicious dessert I have ever had.For our meal we had: grilled octopus, pan roasted halibut, beef tongue, and pork shank. Â All of it tasted amazing, the halibut was our favourite. Â Each dish had exact flavour balance and cooked to perfection. Cocktails are great here as well. Â Would definitely recommend this place!"
"What an epic meal!First of all, David, Alejandro, and Veronica are rock stars!For the last dinner of my most recent visit to the home of my birth, Chicago, Girl & the Goat had to be it. I'd been meaning to come here for a while now. My brother has been here before many times and could not recommend it enough. Not surprisingly, it did not disappoint.Pre-Feast:While waiting for our table, we ordered a cocktail and mine was so freaking good. The drink I ordered was called: Best of Three. It was the perfect pre-meal drink. It was so bright and clean tasting, it cleansed my pallet just right.The Feast:Italian Sausage Bread (fennel-stout butter . pickle relish) - The perfect start. The butter I could just eat by the spoon full and I feel similarly about the pickled relish. And the sausage...mama mia!Nantucket Bay Scallops (french lentils . beech mushrooms . celery root) - This was packed with flavor and the pureed lentils were an excellent compliment.Roasted cauliflower (pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint) - I don't know how they did it, but the cauliflower tasted as if it's been marinated in deliciousness.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro . red wine-maple. potato stix) - This was excellent and tasted like the ultimate breakfast.Roasted Duck Breast (miso-marcona almond butter. rapini. gremolata) - It had good flavor, but the texture of the duck was not great, it was rather chewy. I've had a fair amount of rare-medium rare duck, and this may have been the chewiest I've encountered.Confit Goat Belly (bourbon butter . lobster n' crab . fennel) - This was good, but sounded better than it turned out to be.We were fortunate enough to sit next to possibly the nicest dining couple ever. They and their kids ordered a ton and were stuffed. As a result, they passed over a couple of their dishes over to us. These were the:Crisp Braised Pork Shank (buttermilk dressing . butternut-shiitake kimchee . naan) - Crispy on the outside and juicy underneath, this melts in your mouth. The kimchi sauce was awesome.Shishito Peppers (courtesy of our neighbors) - These are the best shishito peppers I've ever had. They had a spicy, yet smooth flavor and the bread crumbs and sauce were great.I had an Omegang beer during my meal. I love Omegang and liked that they have one of their beers here.Post-Feast: We had no room for dessert so went for coffee only. My brother had an Americano and I went with Espresso. Both were great and the perfect ending to our Â epic feast.Atmosphere: Cool, sexy and I really like when restaurants have some of the cooking on display. Especially with the magic they make here, it was cool totake a peak. Nice wood fire oven too.Service: As stated in the opening, David, Alejandro and Veronica are as good as it gets! The hosts were nice too.Despite a couple of the dishes not being on par with the others, they still deserve 5 stars for a classy show of top notch and creative culinary delight in an intimate setting with exceptional service."
"What a great experience. The food was authentic, unique and flavorful. The atmosphere was great. The staff tried hard."
"Can I say that this place is overrated and overhyped for what it is? Â Yes, the reputation is what they are known for and the name of the restaurant is adorable, but it was a major letdown. Â The food, dining affair, ambiance and service was of the norm for fine dining, but it lacked spark to make it all the difference. Â Presentation was clean cut for all the dishes and the ingredients used, were gourmet.Do order up their red wine just because it is red wine. Â Their Syrah from Cortona was swell. Â The Pig Face is their signature dish. Â It was rich with tenderness, had a red wine maple sauce with it, but lacked an umph. Â Their Chickpea Fritters were delightful. Â I liked the creamy cheese sauce that was on the side of the fritters. Â The fritters and Confit Goat Belly, complimented the red wine well. Â The Goat Belly was tender and a bit gamey, but not much as I would have preferred. Â I liked the chucks of lobsters that were surrounding it as well as the buttery goodness drizzled around it. Â It was a spot on fine dining affair, but it didn't leave a candle lighted spark, unfortunately."
"The service was excellent but with all of the attention this place gets, I expected better. The green garlic pierogi tasted like straight up dough and spring onion. Meh. The grilled marinated pork belly, crisp braised pork shank, multigrain bread, and goat carpaccio were all Â good but nothing to remember. The three that really stuck out to me were the raw oysters (surprising), duck tongues (Who would have thought? This was outstanding.), and calamari bruschetta (omg, I love grilled calamari). Great espresso. Great beer, wine, and cocktails. Great ambiance. Just wish I would have been blown away with every dish, not only half. My friends felt the same sentiment. But hey, I'd come back. Not until I try Little Goat, though."
"This is it, folks. Book your reservation months in advance because all the hype is for good reason. Fantastic dinner during a recent quick trip to Chicago. Arrived 20 minutes early because surprisingly our bus ran on time. We were still seated within 5 minutes which was the first sign of a properly ran establishment (opposite experience from the previous night in which we were asked to come earlier, agreed to come 30 minutes earlier, only to be seated 15 minutes late tsk tsk, Frontera). Back to Girl & the Goat....Our server was on point - so informed on every single menu item. Even though our party pretty much knew what we were going to order a month in advance, our server was still able to educate us on the prep and cooking process for every dish we asked about as well as all the ingredients and the flavor combinations. Well done on teaching the staff all about the menu (including the beers and wines). Everything we ordered was amazing (kusshi oysters; honey sambal brioche; hamachi crudo; grilled baby octopus; wood fired scallops; crisp braised pork shank; goat belly). I don't think you can go wrong with this menu - just order stuff you like to eat and prepare to be in flavor heaven. Pricing is very reasonable. Most dishes are under $20 with the exception of the heartier meat options being a bit more and the veg options averaging $10 each; oysters were $12 for 4; glass of G&tG petit verdot blend was $15 and quite good; a few beers on tap around $6 - the 4 of us had our fill of food and drinks for under $225. I don't get out to Chicago often, but we are already planning our return next year and Girl & the Goat will definitely be one of our dinners."
"The food was underwhelming for me, though the service was excellent. It's a trendy restaurant with a good drink menu in addition to the food menu. Â I really wanted to like this place more. Goat Ribs - brined till the texture of corned beef and extremely salty. I enjoy the nuttiness of the sauce and the radish slaw that accompanied it. It would have been so great if the saltiness level was brought down a few notches.Duck Tongue Salad - I like the combination of the flavors; it's bright and fun. While other components were perfectly seasoned...Duck tongue was SO SALTY. The duck tongue was also really greasy... and then in combination of the fried wonton stripes.. it's like having 2 types of greasy croutons in one dish. I enjoy the flavors of this dish, but can only do a couple spoonfuls at a time.Goat Liver Mousse - my favorite out of all the items. It is served with these fluffy buttered biscuit like bread along with blueberry compote and a couple of house picked vegetables. It's an elevated version of the biscuit with grape jelly you'd see often in a southern meal. If the biscuit (or the butter on it) was less salty, I can probably eat the whole platter myself. Roasted Cauliflower - pretty good. combination of mint and cheese on roasted cauliflower worked well; pickled pepper helped cut through the greasiness of the dish. Pine nuts didn't add much to the dish, though.Roasted Pig Face - :( I LIVE for big pieces of braised fatty pork with skin on.. but I just didn't like the combination of this one. The pork was very mildly seasoned (especially comparing to how salty their other dishes are); I don't know how they cooked it.. but there was no longer any distinction between the skin, the fat, or the meat. When you bite into it, the whole thing just becomes liquid fat in your mouth, and then you get more greasiness from the super skinny potato sticks... it was hard to swallow or take a second bite. The maple balsamic sauce could have helped to brighten the flavor and cut through the grease, but there was so little of the sauce on the plate. Overall, a lot of the dishes we tried are overly salted and very heavy. But then again, this may have be a strategy to get the customers to drink more wine/beer. Service and atmosphere is A++, food is a B-. Portions are really decent for sharing with a few friends. Again, I just wish I could have liked the food more."
"A lot of fancy restaurants, such as G&G,have one thing in common: small portion and over-decorating on the plate.I want down to earth, normal people size entree, without all the grasses and colorful stuff on a piece of meat. This place is for girls and goats, that is where the name is for."
"We made reservations two months in advance for Friday night. Unfortunately we had to change them last minute and ended up with a late Monday reservation. When we got to the restaurant, our table was ready but it was a two person ""bar"" table in the corner facing the kitchen. I was grateful they could accommodate us last minute but you could tell our seating was where they stick walk-ins and last minute accommodations. Kind of in the corner yet still in the middle of all the traffic. And the kitchen was hot. It didn't bother me, though, cause I'm always cold and the kitchen staff was very friendly. We ordered five meals between the two of us: chickpea fritter, escargot ravioli, crispy beef short ribs, honey sambal brioche, and confit goat belly. The waitress said she would choose the best course lineup and would take care of us. The first meal was the crispy beef short ribs. They were definitely crispy on the outside but not as tender as I'd like on the inside. The sauce was tangy yet sweet with pops of grapefruit and avocado. The sauce was real good. Crispy beef short ribs: 7/10Then came the chickpea fritter. So delicious. It came with tons of fixins which was like an explosions of flavor with a little spice. Chickpea fritter: 9.5/10Next came the star of the show: escargot ravioli. It was very light with the perfect chewiness of the escargot. The escargot was very traditional garlic and butter and the whole plate had onion crisps on top. It was by far the best part of the meal. Escargot ravioli: 10/10A surprise (complementary) fourth meal of wood grilled broccoli followed. This was probably due to us making friends with the kitchen staff who was responsible for the broccoli order. We were pretty excited! It had a nice smokey flavor to it and the blue cheese sauce and spiced rice crispies were the perfect complement. If I were to go again, though, I would probably pass on the broccoli and explore other menu items. Wood grilled broccoli: Â 7/10Finally came the confit goat belly. The goat belly had a crispy exterior but the middle melted in your mouth. It wasn't as fatty as pork belly that I've had in the past, but still good. The star of the plate was the lobster n' crab that accompanied the goat belly. Â This was so rich and delicious, especially with the bourbon butter sauce. Confit goat belly: 8/10Lobster n' crab in bourbon butter: 10/10Overall you can see the meal was pretty great. The waitress asked if we were full (which we were) but we asked what happened to the bread. She said ""oops"" and asked if we wanted it now. Personally I don't think bread is the best way to end a meal so we decided to skip it. She then brought us our check, which was correct, but she didn't provide any concessions for messing up our meal. We did get a complementary dish, which was awesome, but we also didn't get to try something we really wanted. At least give us the iced tea for free! Overall I do want to go back and try some of the other plates but I wouldn't classify this experience as breathtaking."
"Got the Bison Burger. It was tasty, but I do wish they had an option for cheeses. Not a fan of American cheese."
A lot of hype for this place but it's incredibly well deserved. Â The selections here are amazing and of great quality. Â The environment is extremely welcoming and just the right mix of class and casual. Â Dying to go back here again!
"This restaurant is fun to go to because it is set up tapas style so you will get to try a wide variety of things. The menu is extremely unique and all of the ingredients are very fresh. It has it's staples without a doubt but don't be afraid to try something new because it is rare for anything to disappoint. These are the things we ate:- SautÃ©ed Green Beans- people talk about these like they're crack, they are very good but I don't think they're the best veggie on the menu- Roasted Cauliflower- these however are the best veggie on the menu. I'm a meat fanatic and if this is all I ate last night I would have left happy.- Chickpea Fritter- These were tasty but not my favorite. We had a vegetarian at the table so they were a good choice for her.- Green Garlic Pierogies- Great savory but vegetarian option. Heavy on the onions.- Squash Blossom 'Crab Rangoon'- A light seafood dish that won't fill you up but if you want to get some seafood on the table this is a nice option.- Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face- Their number one staple and not one to miss. I recommend mixing it all together.- Honey Sambal Brioche- Delicious bread to start with, very sweet.- Goat Empanadas- You obviously have to get at least one goat dish at Girl and the Goat, this one is a bit more subtle but still with great flavors. It is served with your classic empanada toppings."
One of the best restaurants I've ever been too! I highly recommend this place and the waiters are so helpful in deciding what to order.
"Another delicious meal in Chicago. On my recent girls' trip to Chicago, our main focus was dining at all the great restaurants in Chicago. Girl & the Goat was definitely on that list and I had made reservations a month out and was able to get a 9:45pm reservation on a Tuesday evening. I was surprised I was only able to get a late reservation a month out, but goes to show that it must be great!When we arrived at the restaurant, I instantly liked the upbeat/loud atmosphere. The outside of the restaurant was quiet and empty, but once you went in, you felt like you were at a dining hot spot in a big city (which it is!). The artwork of literally the Girl & the Goat is also awesome - the goat that you see on the walls, menus, etc. is just too damn cute and that girl, I just love it. Not your typical ""pretty"" art - just very artsy, cool, something different. The service while we were here was very friendly and attentive. The table you seat at is small/tight, but it works out with the small plates. Also gives it an intimate feel.Between my girlfriend and I, we ordered the Roasted Cauliflower, Hamachi Crudo, Crisp Braised Pork Shank, and Goat Liver Mousse. Everything was delicious and pretty much ""died and gone to heaven"" good - that's exactly how I described the food while eating it. Everything was just incredibly and absolutely delicious, however, my favorites were the Goat Liver Mousse and Roasted Cauliflower. You know a place is good if they can make a vegetable dish that amazing! The Goat Liver Mousse was divine, but if you order it, it is a pretty big portion. Nonetheless, I ate a ton of it and it made me way too full, but so worth it. It comes with a couple pickled sides and crumpets - oh man those crumpets were delicious. I also had one of their cocktails - Best of Three (ketel one, pimms #1, cucumber, lime), which was great. Overall, fantastic food, great service, and fun vibes. Another restaurant that I wish I went to with a bigger group so that I could try more dishes. Four dishes was a bit much for two people, but I couldn't resist. Will definitely return if and when I'm back in Chicago."
"The hype is real!!! Visiting from NYC and had to try this place. Sat at the bar, bar tenders are super friendly and know their stuff. I went off of their recommendations and was not disappointed. No matter what you order, make sure you save room for dessert. The dessert is a killer!!!"
I find the majority of the food salty and the wine that was recommended to me last time was not what I wanted. I told the waitress that I like fruity wine but what she offered at the table was super dry and somewhat of a burnt after flavor.
"We made our reservation in June for an Saturday night in August.. Â Don't use open table to book as you will get better times by calling the restaurant. Â We were visiting from Out of town and couldn't wait to come to this nationally recognized restaurant and trust me our experience at G&G lived up to its reputation We had 5 plates for 2 people which seemed like the right amount of food. Â Our favorites were braised pork shank, confit goat belly with lobster and the roasted cauliflower. Â The combinations of the ingredients were interesting! Â A definitely must if you are a foodie! Â The Â restaurant had a hip vibe. Â The service was excellent and staff friendly and helpful!"
"Now we are talking! This place has seen the classic Restaurant Hip-ness Curve, from people loving it when it opened to people calling it overhyped. In today's hipster world, I think this is the natural course of restaurant public perception. But in the case of the Girl and the Goat, this really isn't a fair course to run, because this place is great.First of all, it's tapas. Goat related tapas. So not only can you order a ton of different things, but you get to try a ton of different things. Many of them goat. Second, not all of them are goat! There is actually a great variety of things. Two of my all time favorites are the Liver Mousse and the Pig Face -- I think they're delicious. The vegetables also come in pretty reasonable, large portions, so you can fill up on the veggies and taste the other plates. Which brings me to three -- you can usually order enough to actually have a full meal here!! What an absolute rarity!! And for the price, you come out pretty well here -- you can definitely eat really well for $$$, but if you want to make this a $$ kinda night, you could totally pull that off too, just by ordering different (but equally delicious!) things and avoiding drinks.The food itself is interesting but not too interesting. This is a compliment.The atmosphere is not too loud, though it is on the louder end. There are nice wood tables, the lighting is dim and unaggressive, the service is totally fantastic (when we've had to wait with a reservation, they always bring us something on the house, and they do a great job with timing the dishes as they bring them out).It's always a little bit surprising how hard it is to get a reservation. So book it now, and put it on your calendar. Prepare to be pleased!"
"I've been wanting to come here for at least 3 years, and I finally made it! It was everything I had hoped for. Great food, good ambiance, nice wait staff! We ordered the Taco Bread, Goat Carpaccio, Walt's Chicken, Fried Oyster, Squash Blossom, Shishito Peppers, and Pig Face. We really liked everything, but our favorites were the fried oysters, squash blossoms, and shishito peppers. Mmmmmm, so much more to try. I will definitely want to come back here the next time I'm in Chicago."
"Chef Stephanie is a genius! Â She makes food art because that's how your dishes look when it comes out; a masterpiece.I was fortunate enough to dine here twice in the dining room (once with a reservation that I had made 3 months in advance, and the 2nd a party had cancelled freeing up a table in the back where you have the few view of the kitchen). Â Both times I walked out with a giant smile on my face, and with a food baby. Â Foodies, you know what I mean when I say food baby.My personal favorites here are the following:Roasted CauliflowerWood Fired Striped BassPig FaceGoat EmpanadasBread (pick one.. any one and it's going to be delicious)So let's break down flavor profiles of said favorite dishes.V for VegetableIf Chef Stephanie tried to feed me this as a child, I might have started loving vegetables earlier in life. Â The mint and pine nuts in the cauliflower really brings out a savory quality of this dish. Â The mint brightens the dish where the pine nuts brings an earthy quality to the dish. Â The pine nuts also gives a different crunch to the dish. Â The reviews that came before mine are all true! Â This is a dish you must have!F is for FishDon't like the goat liver throw you off. Â Whatever pre-conceived notion you have about liver, take that idea.. ball it up.. and throw it away. Â Just toss it out! Â The sweet, sweet bass with the creamy liver aioli is a match made in heaven. Â And the mushroom mole gives this typically light flavored fish an edge. Â Chef Stephanie brought a new meaning to surf and turf in this plate.M is for MeatBacon.. sayonara! Â Step out of that comfort zone and get the Pig Face. Â The pig face is melt in your mouth goodness! Â One bite and you'll realize that this is the best cut of pork. Â Fatty, buttery goodness! Â Goat Empanadas are topped with grilled mushroom giardiniera and I cannot get enough of it! Â This is the perfect dish to break the ice for your friends who are a little antsy around new food. Â As another Chef had once said, ""If it looks good, eat it!"" Â  (-Andrew Zimmern) Â Here's the thing.. Goat meat is a more tender meat that almost has the consistancy of a slow cooked brisket with a milder taste than beef. Â They won't be able to tell that its goat.. they'll think its beef. Â Then you can drop the bomb that they tried something new! Â Help broaden their taste palate! Â And lastly... the bread. Â Omg! Â The fresh bread is to die for. Â The bread menu changes which makes it exciting! Â I had the Apple Bread (forgot the exact name), the Jack-o-Lantern, and the Green Bean Casserole. Â If I could.. I could've eaten all 3 bread rolls in one sitting but I guess that's frowned upon.Try to save room for dessert. Â The Miso Butterscotch Budino is my favorite of the 4. Â Its really hard because the PB&J was a close 2nd. Â The crunchy brittle with the soft butterscotch budino... Yummo! Â Its a little denser than pudding and the best culinary creation ever! Â The best part of my time here, was that I saw Chef Stephanie! Â And she took a picture with us!!!! #geeked #celebsighting #bestnighteverYes, i am done with my novel. Â If you managed to read all this, thank you! Â I could go on about this place! Â Better yet, I hope this made you hungry and motivated to go here!"
"I've had the privilege of dining at Girl and the Goat on 3 separate occasions and each time I thoroughly enjoyed my dining experience.The food is always delicious with great flavors, fresh ingredients and presented beautifully on the plate. I recommend you try: the roasted oysters, pig face, escargot ravioli and the apple buckle (dessert).The service is always impeccable with the staff being knowledgeable about the menu and what wine(s) go best with what you have ordered. A special shout out to Taylor who is the best server I've countered during my dining experiences in the west loop area.I highly recommend that you visit this establish because the food is worth the hype. The only reason I'm not giving Girl and the Goat 5 stars is because I HATE how close the tables are to each other."
I am getting sick of restaurants serving food from the kitchen when they want without any plan of what goes with what and matching the tastes with the order of the plates.This restaurant had such good hype I was expecting more. Our entree and side flavors did not blend in the palate. The sides were huge and came near the end of the meal and who wants spicy cauliflower then. The goat empanadas filling was ok but the crust was limp and undercooked. The chicken in mole sauce was ok nothing special. The pan roasted halibut was not bad. The place is lively and energetic. The service was too attentive in not a good way like they wanted us out of there. the waitress kept coming over to ask us if we wanted to order like every five minutes crazy.
"Worth every penny. Some of the best drinks, and possibly THE best food of my life. So inventive and delicious!Very cool atmosphere and knowledgeable staff. Just be sure to get a reservation very far in advance if you have more than 2 people. Otherwise, try your luck with a walk in and sit at the bar/lounge while you wait."
"If you're in Chicago, Girl & the Goat is a MUST try! I was expecting it to be overhyped, but everything was delicious! I was trying to book reservations a week in advance with no luck. So I went in on a Friday night and waited no more than 20mins for a seat at the bar which worked out fine. Our bartenders were very nice, accommodating, and fun to watch. One was dancing and they would be throwing glasses of water to each other.Now on to the food..- Pig Face - OMG best thing here! You MUST get this. It was ridiculously tender and so full of flavor. The egg was cooked perfectly and it's meant to be dug in and 'messy'. So good!- Nantucket Bay Scallops - the scallops were cooked well, but I didn't care too much for it.Steamed Cape Cod Mussels - plenty of mussels and the sauce was soo good with their bread. I couldn't get enough of it. Also, a good portion for sharing!Crisp Braised Pork Shank - This was hugeeee. I was sharing with another person and we couldn't finish it. This was also very tender and fell off the bone perfectly. I wasn't a huge fan of the buttermilk dressing that it came with though. However, when eaten all together with the naan like a sandwich, it all came together quite nicely.Overall, a great experience and would definitely want to come back just for the Pig Face!"
"I've been waiting FOREVER to try this restaurant. The key is to call to make a reservation in advance. You never know - they might have an opening when you're available. I cannot describe how AMAZING the service here is. We made reservations for 6 PM on a Friday night, and we were afraid that we wouldn't make our reservation because our party was incomplete. The host was quite understanding and held our tables until 30 minutes after our reservation time. They were even willing to let us sit down and order ahead of time before the rest of our party arrived. The concept of this restaurant is really cool. Once you sit down, you have to pick all of your dishes for the meal at one time. Plan to order about 2-3 dishes/person. Once you order, the restaurant will serve the dishes one at a time as they see fit. You MUST order the Pig Face, Scallops and Halibut. Every dish is absolutely amazing, but those are definitely my top 3. Stephanie Izard is a genius! Every dish is carefully constructed and cooked to perfection. I can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu!"
"This place is all that it is cracked up to be. Â  We had:PigFace, Beef Tongue with FrisÃ©e and Potato Crisp,Ham Frites, Multigrain Bread, Yo Quiero Taco Bread, Pierogi, Goat Empanadas, Goat Carpaccio, Warm Marinated Olives, Â Dessert: Â Buddino and Blackberry Shortcake with Blackberry Mint Ice Cream (picked from Stephanie's magical secret garden)I'm going to keep it real and not go all food critic, but the food was EXCELLENT. Â  Stephanie Izzard and her squad should teach a life course on the importance of Balance when creating a dish. Â Each dish was executed perfectly, piping hot and balanced flavors of sweet/salty/hot/cold/rich/acidity. Â I've never had a meal like this. Â She makes Emeril restaurants look like Playschool Kitchens.Simply Awesome.P.s. Â I am sensitive to rich foods but had zÃ©ro issues with fat or greasiness at this place."
"Very cool ambiance. Dim lights with good music in the background. It is very loud and hard to have a conversation unless you are sitting very close to each other. Even though they are very crowded, the service is superb. I tried their famous pig face, it was very tender and juicy, but had lots of fat, but it had a unique taste and I overall enjoyed it."
"The family and I ate dinner here last night.. The food here is incredible, I love the manner in which they bring the food out, there style is called topaz if I recall correctly. The servers bring one menu item out at a time.. We order the sautÃ©ed string beans!( which by the way are remarkably delicious) the pasta cheese ravioli for my son..(mom and dad tasted the pasta repeatedly) lol.. The beef tongue was better then I expected.. It was my first time tasting beef tongue. The chicken dish was also very good, it had a bit of Rosemary in the seasoning.. The goat potion was small but it was also our last dish, we were all so stuffed from the entire meal.Great place!!!P.S. They frown on walk-ins!! Make a reservation"
"This place is the must go to spot in Chicago!Made dinner reservations a week in advance for a Monday and the only available spot was at 9:30pm. We arrived a bit early at 8:30 and we were nicely told by the host that they would not be able to accommodate the early arrival. I looked around the restaurant and it was very believable. EVERY SINGLE table was taken with waiters bustling around.After a drink nearby we came back at 9:30 and were nicely seated next to another couple that was making out (hahaha). We ordered the sausage bread that came out first... spectacular with the butter! For our main dishes we ordered:The pig face - with the egg on table we were told to just mash everything up and eat it like a hash. After we did that, it was amazing! I'd have to say it seemed like they used alot of truffle oil and salt. The taste was great but was feeling a bit heavy after hahaThe Lamb Shank - BOMB! it was flash fried so it had the crispy outside but was fully juicy on the inside. The pita bread was soooooo dam soft. Get some of the pita bread, put some of the lamb shank inside and then some of the side sauces on the side (THE ORANGE TANGY ONE)..... BOMB! The grilled octopus: Awesome! Thick pieces were grilled and then sauteed with veggies.. it was the perfect mixture of spices. I'd say just the right amount of everything... spiciness, tangyness and saltiness... The cauliflower: Not normally a fan of cauliflower but it was super soft so that was a plus... it almost didnt taste like the usual cauliflower so to me it was great! hahahaThe place is super trendy with very fast and attentive service. Overall, one of the best places i've dined at."
"I finally got the chance to check out this place on my most recent trip to Chicago. My co-worker and I were able to find a seat immediately at the bar which was surprising. I know that reservations fill up fast so be sure to plan ahead or expect a long wait. If you are wondering why it is such a pain to get in then I would recommend asking people about the food. To start we had the broccoli and pork belly. The flavor was unreal. Perfect combination of sauce, spice and natural flavors. Loved both dishes.the trump card for me was the Goat Moose. The bread they served with the moose was perfect for the meal. That and the interesting assortment of jam, picked and chilies made for a fantastic close to a fantastic meal. I highly recommend this restaurant if you live or travel to Chicago. Great atmosphere, great food and great people. Thank you!"
"Let me just start off by saying that I wanted to give this place a five-star review SO bad. My mom and I were visiting from California, and we had made a 5PM reservation for a Wednesday. When we came in, we were seated immediately, but I did notice quite a lot of empty seats. I'm not sure if they were for walk-ins, but I still think that it was good that we had a reservation. The restaurant itself is huge and beautiful, and I loved the atmosphere of the place!This restaurant serves food in small dishes, so for two people, the waitress recommended three to four plates. We ordered the roasted cauliflower, the confit goat belly, the pig face, and the grilled baby octopus. Before I get into the food, I have to admit that the service here was AMAZING. The waiters and waitresses were super attentive and catered to our every need! Okay on to the food. The roasted cauliflower was SO GOOD. I wish I ordered two plates of that stuff! It was nice and smokey, and with the pine nuts and mint = DELICIOUS! The pig face was pretty good, but I don't really like the fatty-ish pieces of meat, so in retrospect I probably shouldn't have ordered this... The confit goat belly was delicious! The sauces that came with it were really interesting and I recommend that one. The only one I don't recommend is the grilled baby octopus. We were recommended this one by the waitress, and I thought the flavors were a little bit too strong altogether. It was little too salty, bitter, and while it wasn't bad, I just did not like it that much. Overall, it's a great restaurant to check out in Chicago, and if I ever find myself in the Windy City again, I will make a trip here!"
"Believe the hype and do what you must to snag a reservation. Â I had to call from Los Angeles a month prior, and I was only able to snag a 10:15 pm reservation for a Sunday night...A red-eye flight from LA, straight to the Bean, aka Cloud Gate, and then to a Cubs vs. Dodgers game (LA prevailed), we arrived at TG&G utterly exhausted but ready for a foodie experience. Â The four of us sat down to:Breads:*Johnny Apple-Cheese (apple chunks baked in with chili-butter & malted oil)*Sourdough PB&J (peanut butter with Concord grape ""jam"")Starters:*Beet Salad (with green beans, white anchovy, avocado creme fraiche & bread crumbs)*Green Beans (fish sauce vinaigrette & cashews)Mains:*Octopus (guanciale, Romano beans, Brussels leaves, pistachios, lemon vinaigrette)*Loup de Mer (country fried with tamarind sweet & sour, cucumber salad, shrimpy fried grains)*Pig Face (wood oven roasted with sunny side up egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple and potato stix)*Kalbi Ribs (with roasted corn)*Scallops (with Cubano pork, apple mojo & pepper-raisin relish)Desserts:*Miso-Butterscotch Budino (bacon toffee, glazed pineapple & candied cashews)*Thai Basil Choco Chip Gelato (bittersweet chocolate & blackberries)Cocktail:*The Earhart (Chicago Distillery Ceres Vodka, yellow chartreuse, maraschino, lemon, and lavender bitters)To skip to the end, unbelievably, this feast for the senses came to only $145.00 and was easily one of the best meals I've had this year! Â GO! Â NOW!I was dining with three others, two older folks, meat & potato types who are certainly not ""foodies"" and a friend who usually follows my lead. Â I had to convince the others to try the octopus. Â The Pig Face frightened them all, but I had read other Yelp reviews, In particular, Michael U of Las Vegas, and he has impeccable taste...so Pig Face it was (even if I had to eat it all by myself!)Suffice it to say that everyone was more than pleased with my choices and all tried the Pig Face, which is just as good as others have described. Â Don't let the name scare you, it's utterly delicious!Everything was perfectly executed and enjoyed. Â The taste combinations were satisfying enough for any discerning foodie (ahem) and also your meat & potatoes crowd.My advice, take a few people so you can get a good range of tastes. Â Your guests don't need to be particularly adventurous...but if you are the foodie in residence, you'll be delighted."
"DROOL.I made reservations about a month in advance just to make sure I'd be able to try this place. I'm from LA and have had my fair share of good food, but I must say, this place blew me away. I went with a group of 5 and we ordered a good portion of the menu. It's tapas style and each dish just got better and better. The reviews don't lie, order the pig's face! The pork shank was one of my favorite; the meat was so juicy and tender. Given the name Girl & the GOAT, you should definitely try a goat dish-the empanadas were delicious. I thought it might taste like lamb (which I'm not a fan of) but if it did, the flavoring hides it well. Pork belly and duck tongue was just as tastey. And don't forget your veggies! Shishito peppers and green beans were on point. There's always room for dessert...the rice pudding and butterscotch budino is a must! My sister, who's favorite meal is dessert, rated those as some of the best she's had. ENJOY because I sure did."
"Since I went here, I can only think about going here again, if you are ever in Chicago you HAVE to go here. It is a destination spot ( along with the bean & sears tower) I made reservations for a Thursday night since my friend was coming in town, and I was only able to get reservations at 10:30 pm, which isn't the best time but oh well, next time I will probably try and get earlier reservations. We got here a bit early, and they seated us right away. My friend and I tried to look up the menu online, but that didn't work out, so we spend about 10 min. perusing the menu. We settled on Goat carpaccio - the slices of goat were so thin it was flimsy, I was literally scraping it off the plate . Slightly acidic, and a perfect way to round out the rest of our more heavy dishes. Goat confit belly - my least favorite dish , the goat wasn't that tender, and the entire dish just didn't live up to any expectations. Â I was hoping for a crispy fatty piece of meat, but it was just dry and not good at all. Wood oven roasted pork face - TOP DISH MUST ORDER. the pork is SOO TENDER AND FATTY. The egg and crispy potato pieces are just ridiculous. Â My friend and I devoured this dish. Warm brioche - It seemed a bit pricey to me to pay $5 for bread, but this brioche was like a popover x 10, so imagine a popover with tons of lovable fluffiness inside. yes that's it. Sauteed green beans - who knew green beans could be so delicious???? Fish sauce and green beans are now something that I know go together.. probably the best veggies I have ever had, I do wish I had some rice to go with it though. DessertMiso buttersctotch budino - butterscotch pudding with bacon toffee pieces, with the moist cake in the middle. Citrus fruit pavlova - I liked this soo much. the ice cream was so fruity and citrusy, it was the best dessert to end the meal. Bill was $60 each including tips. not bad for one of the best meals in my life. Coming here again, going to try every single thing on this menu before I move out of Chicago."
"Soo delicious, we loved everything we ordered. Definitely worth the 1 month waiting list for reservation!"
"Best place ever!!!Note I have attempted to come here on several other occasions never succeeding because it was closed for the holidays, too full, or I got lost taking the bus there. When I found that there was a 11:00 PM reservation I immediately snatched it up despite how late it would be.We landed in Chicago, dropped off our luggage, and took a Uber over there to eat. What a wonderful start to our trip!!Items we ordered:Wood oven roasted pig faceMiso-butterscotch budino with bacon toffeePan roasted halibutHighly recommend all of them! The halibut was the best!"
"First time I went here it was one of the best experiences I had ever had at a restaurant.Had I experienced the same level of service upon my second visit, this place would be 5 star no doubt.However, my second (and last) visit ruined the place for me. Â Our waiter was rude, the food wasn't as great as the first time and we had to wait for everything (including water, they only filled our glasses once during our hour long meal).I had been raving to my fiancee about this place for months since our first visit and we took my parents there as one of the two restaurants we visited during their short stay in Chicago.I was embarrassed to have brought them based on our experience. I talked to a manager about my disappointment due to my amazing first experience and how I had expected more out of the establishment... he didn't seem to care at all.No problem, I will take my business elsewhere.Good service is only exceptional if it's consistent."
"Get the pig face, the roasted cauliflower and some bread! The food was SO good, even better than I expected-- I've hoped to go to the Girl and the Goat ever since Stephanie opened it, since I'm a massive Top Chef fan--but the service was just ok. We knew it would be difficult to get in without a reservation, so since we had a more flexible schedule, we set our goal at getting there early. We arrived at about 4:10 on a Friday and there was nobody waiting, so we got to put our names down first. We were told we could be seated right at 4:30 but would have to leave by 6, which was fine, since we had a flight to catch. We were seated facing the kitchen (awesome!) at a big table that could fit about 8 people, but then about 10 minutes later, two people were seated in the seats facing us (weird!). I'm not sure why they do that, but I still liked watching the cooks work. We saw Stephanie Izard in the kitchen! She was super hands-on, both cooking and expediting. I was too chicken to ask for a picture, haha. We started with the jack-o-lantern bread ($4), which was super soft (though with a lovely crust) and cheesy pumpkin bread served with brown butter butter. I could have just eaten that for dinner and been thrilled, honestly. They bake it across the street at the Little Goat Diner and it came out really warm. Then we got the beet salad ($9), which was probably the least exciting thing of the night, but it was still good. The wild striped bass was so surprising and delicious-- I didn't know how the mushroom mole and smoked clams would really work with it, but it was such a great combination. The fish was perfectly cooked-- it was soft but had great crisp skin. Then came two of my favorites: the roasted cauliflower ($10 I think) and the pig face ($15 I think). I wish I could make my cauliflower so well at home! The pine nuts, parmesan, pickled peppers and mint (which was unexpected) really brought the whole dish together. Our waitress encouraged us to turn the pig face into a hash with tiny crispy potato strips and a fried egg. The whole mess was really crunchy and fatty and fantastic-- GET IT! The goat loin ($22) was good since it wasn't too goat-y. I didn't know you could cook goat medium, but it was basically like a steak. It came with a autumn squash mix and ""goat xo sauce,"" which was mysterious but tasty. However, I couldn't stop thinking about the previous two dishes, which were definitely my favorites! The portion sizes are really reasonable for a small plates place. With the five dishes (plus bread) that we got, we were stuffed. Finally, some complaints about the service: The waitress took a long time to take our orders (I think it was around 4:50 when she finally did, and since they wanted us out quickly, I felt like she should have moved things along). This is probably kind of nitpicky, but I didn't like that she said she was there to ""hang out with us"" that evening. I'm all for casual, but I feel like that's just kind of weird! Also, though she told us to trust her with the food pacing, the first couple came out pretty quickly, then there was a long gap before we got the pig and the goat. I hope to visit again with a reservation-- I'd love to sit at one of the seats right next to the expediting station, where you can watch everything in the kitchen super closely."
"To be clear, I want to give this place a 4.5.The food is everything you read in all the reviews, quality over quantity. Please keep that in mind, if you are hungry, you will need to drop serious cash as the dishes are all share dishes. They really push that fact here and to be honest I happen to love that in any dining experience.Cons: long wait. Called first, woman said no reservations. (This is untrue as we already saw it was possible on opentable but wanted to call to try and sneak a res. The hostess greeted us at 820 and said we can be put on the wait list but reservations would be taken first and recommend next time we make one (yeah....thanks)The hostesses keep close watch of the quoted time. On her screen (yes I'm the annoying customer who sneaks a peek every chance I can to see what my progress is when there's a long wait) it showed that the checkin time was 820 and quoted time was for 9:50. There were a few times they could have sat us, but if you guessed it...yes, we got a table at 9:50. I will say, yes for those that have experienced it before 90 minutes is not the worst wait for this restaurant and for us was a must from all the recommendations. We got 4 dishes, Shishito peppers were on point. Amazing combination w Parmesan cheese really complimented each other.My gf favorite was the cavetelli pasta dish w carrots gooseberries and a mixed meat sauce combo beef pork and lamb. Overall, get a reservation in advance. If you don't get a res expect a long wait, if your hungry expect to pay a pretty penny."
The wait is pretty long but we snagged some lounge seats in 5 minutes instead. The food was awesome. My friend and I ordered a bunch of different things to split and try. Favorites were the fish and oyster we ordered.
"Girl & the Goat was our first stop after landing in Chicago's O'Hara Airport, and one that we'd been anticipating for over a month; after all, we had to make reservations that far in advance in order to get a table even at 10PM. Avid followers of Top Chef will recall Stephanie Izard immediately; she was the winner of Season 4 - the first female chef to achieve the title of ""Top Chef"". Since then, she's successfully opened Girl & The Goat, her most popular restaurant, as well as Little Goat, and published her first cookbook (Girl in The Kitchen) in 2011. Needless to say, our expectations going in were quite high.Despite our reservation, we weren't seated until 10 or 15 minutes afterwards, which normally wouldn't have been an issue, but given the already late time, was made dramatically more painful. Regardless, we were promptly seated by our cheerful server, who gave us a quick overview of the menu, including the shared plates format as well as some highlighted dishes. After perusing the various section (split out between Vegetables, Fish, Meats, Bread, and of course Goat headers), we decided on five plates to share, which were brought out intermittently throughout our meal.First to arrive was the Hamachi Crudo, a plate consisting of four slices of hamachi topped with a handful of diced crispy pork belly, a chili aioli, and a few pieces of thinly sliced, toasted bread. On paper, the dish sounded far more attractive than the actual taste. I missed a noticeable punch of acidity that should have accompanied the hamachi, and the pairing of pork belly and fish easily overwhelmed the latter. The sliced caperberries were a creative addition, but one that I failed to see the utility of, especially as it further served to mask the flavor of the hamachi. Thankfully, the Nantucket Bay Scallops were much more successful, as the sauteed scallops were paired with earthy beech mushrooms and a creamy french letil puree, followed by a slight lift with the celery root.I'm grateful we added the Ham Frites to our order, as we were given a generous serving of thin fries which came with an accompanying Smoked Tomato Aioli, as well as a Cheddar Beer sauce. I would have appreciated a simple side of ketchup, though, as both sauces were rather heavy, especially in conjunction. It was a stark contrast to our final two dishes: first, the Roasted Duck Breast. The protein was cooked to an enviable medium, and topped with a garnish of rapini, peppers, and crispy rice noodles. The miso-marcona almond butter was relatively faint, although it did pair well with the sauteed onions and broccolini that formed the base of the dish. Less impressive was the Goat Belly confit, a dish that took a small portion of confited goat belly topped with an overzealous amount of sliced fennel and a nearly indistinguishable serving of lobster and crab. The goat belly was on the tougher side, and the already distinct gaminess clashed with the brininess of the shellfish.In hindsight, perhaps my biggest complaint about Girl and The Goat, aside from dishes that scored across the board in terms of successfulness, was the relatively small portion size of each plate. Despite having five shared plates, we were still left wanting by the end of the meal... not a desirable outcome after spending nearly $100 on just the food. Perhaps I'm just biased, but I don't see why the restaurant has been met with such widespread acclaim; unfortunately, since it's also a lengthy plane ride away, I may never know."
"Dinner at this restaurant capped off our visit to Chi City, and I'm so glad that we made this reservation on the recommendation of a friend right after she found out we were going on this trip. Boyfriend had made the reservation as a late birthday gift to me -- and we had to make it about 2 months in advance.We lucked out and were seated right in front of the open kitchen, so we had a first-hand view of everyone preparing and serving the food. We sat in front of the salad/tartare chef and the dessert chef. If you can manage to snag this seat, then I highly recommend you do! The chefs were so nice and were more than happy to provide answers for any question that I had (including, but not limited to ""what are you doing,"" ""what's that,"" and ""did I order this?"").We ordered the wood grilled broccoli (with rogue smokey bleu sauce and spiced crispies), goat liver mousse (served with watermelon salad, smoked pear mostarda and crumpets), and the wood oven roasted pig face (with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantry, red wine-maple sauce and potato stix). We were also comped a plate of pan fried shishito peppers because our waitress felt that they would be a good compliment to our other dishes. And I also received a little complimentary dessert of the peach and blueberry crumble with honey graham cake and goat cheese gelato as Boyfriend had put down that it was my birthday as the special occasion :)Gonna break it down by dish here, but for an early tl;dr -- IT WAS ALL AMAZING AND YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY GO IF YOU GET A CHANCE TO.Wood grilled broccoli -- this was probably Boyfriend's favorite dish of the entire evening. He was IN LOVE. Normally, we're not big fans of bleu cheese, but the dressing on the grilled broccoli was light enough not to be overwhelming and perfectly complimented the grilled taste of the broccoli. This was an amazingly light appetizer that we inhaled.Goat liver mousse -- I was honestly worried that this was going to be waaay too rich for me to enjoy (like the duck liver mousse I've had at State Bird Provisions -- too rich to finish), but it wasn't too rich at all! I mean, it's rich -- but not so much that you felt as though it were coating your throat and arteries as you swallowed. It was AMAZING when you spread it on the crumpets and topped it with the smoked pear mostarda, which cuts into the richness just enough that all the flavors blend together and take you away to heaven. Not even kidding.Pan fried shishito peppers -- I was worried this dish would be spicy but it wasn't at all! The exterior is crispy and interior is tender, the peppers are perfectly pan fried and retain an incredible amount of flavor, perfectly complimented by the parmesan, sesame and miso. Seriously, I'm sitting here drooling as I'm thinking about it.Wood oven roasted pig face -- hands down, probably the best part of the meal. It was so tender and flavorful and amazing. Not actually a pig's face looking back at you (I don't know why I thought this was the case, but I did), but think more like cabeza meat in Mexican dishes. What with the sunny side egg and the ""potato stix"" (a fancy way to say hash browns), it was like a super succulent breakfast dish.Peach and blueberry crumble with honey graham cake and goat cheese gelato -- so glad I only got a taster dish of this as a birthday freebie. I never would've finished the full-size dish as I was already stuffed to the seams from the meal itself. This is a pretty rich dessert because of the gelato, but the crumble and cake help to cut it just enough that you're not overwhelmed.Seriously, this is a 5-star place. Come hungry, leave happy. And, honestly, it doesn't really break the wallet for the quality of food that you're getting! If I ever visit Chicago again (and I will!!), I'm definitely make this a regular stop!"
"Tried to make a reservation several times and finally we are here! I don't know it was because my expectations are too high or what, but I was not so impressed with the food. We got chickpea fritters, scallops, shrimps and goat empanadas and pig face. I like the combination of yogurt and veggies in the chickpea fritters. The shrimps were okay but the mushrooms and veggies in there was way too salty. I remember seeing reviews about dishes being too salty and I guess they were right!We got the cake with passion fruit source in it and that was AMAZING. I would give a 3.5 but since it's below my expectation, I give a 3..."
"I came to this place with pretty high expectations as friends and strangers alike have raved to me about this joint. We made reservations for a small group weeks before and on the day of reckoning, we had to suddenly add a lost soul to the party. The staff informed us that it will be hard to add another seat to our group as space will be limited during service. We were all too willing to ditch this wounded soldier, but lady luck would prevail and we got seats outdoors instead. Needless to say, we made this guest sit by the streets and away from the heat lamp as punishment.On to the fixings - we pretty much ordered the whole menu that night including their famous chickpea fitters, green beans, goat liver pate and cauliflower. The star of the night however was the pig face...Very rarely, in life or in art will you ever experience something so utterly transcendent that you still have dreams about it months later. The sizzling mess, the decadent crisp texture, the enriching flavor of the pig face on an egg blanket left my palate in absolute amazement. Expectations met."
"Stopped by on a Monday night without reservations, but we were able to get seated at 4:30 (opening) as long as we were out by 6 p.m. I was so happy they were able to accommodate us after hearing all the great things my friend had to say about this place (then I realized this is Stephanie Izard's place and I HAD to come). We were seated at a communal table, which was fine by me.Before coming, I had done my research aka read through Yelp and knew what I wanted before we were even seated. The hostess was super friendly and kind, and so was our server Kelly. She asked if we were first timers and gave us a great run-down of the menu, which is always appreciated when you're new to a place.La Paloma: I asked our server if this or the Local 75 was more sour and she pointed me to La Paloma. Loved it and it was definitely perfect for my tastes -- I like my cocktails sour and tart to the point that I can't taste the alcohol in it :PHamachi Crudo: Even though the pork belly was very good, I wasn't impressed by this dish. Hamachi and crispy pork belly make a surprisingly delicious combination, but this didn't live up to the ""hype"" of Girl and the Goat for me. I'd skip this dish unless you really love hamachi and/or pork belly.Goat Carpaccio: We though since we were here, why not try some goat. The boyfriend and I both never had goat before this and thought we'd go all out with raw meat. Good dish, but nothing impressive.Roasted Cauliflower: Almost every Yelp review mentioned this dish, so of course we had to get it. And finally, a dish that lived up to my expectations! This was my favorite dish of the night and I could've just eaten three orders of this and been happy. The mint, pine nuts, peppers were perfect with the roasted cauliflower -- such a unique, great combo. This is a MUST ORDER dish.Pan Roasted Halibut: Yes. Yes. Yes. I'm not a big fan of fish, but this was SO good. The fish was a touch overcooked (dry =/) but the sauce fixed that problem. The menu says the fish comes/is cooked with a marcona almond butter and blueberry nuoc cham, which reminds me of a ponzu-y flavor but more sour and pungent.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: The boyfriend was hesitant about this after I told him I wanted to try it. Days before we hit up Girl and the Goat, he goes on Google and reads about how the dish is made, which really does involve cooking the pig's face. When the dish came, that was all the could think about and could only eat so much. He was definitely overthinking it and weirding himself out, but I loved it. It has a taste that reminds me of teriyaki, but I can't quite put my finger on what food it reminds me off. But whatever. It's delicious. Order it.While some dishes were underwhelming, the overall experience was great. Our water was constantly refilled and they switched out our dirty dishes three times. Kelly came back and checked on us a few times -- not so much that she was annoying, and not so little that we felt she forgot about us. I'd definitely come back again if I'm ever in Chicago again!"
"One of my favorite dining spots in the city. The menu is eclectic, food is incredibly delicious and the atmosphere is always lively. Â Make your reservations months in advance because it is quite popular."
"Over 3,000 Yelp reviews, what more can I add? I was excited to get an Open Table reservation a week or so before my visit to Chicago. It was an early reservation on a Thursday night, and when we got there I had the sense that we could have been seated without a reservation. That said, by the time we left, the restaurant was packed. Everything was delicious. The waiter was very knowledgeable and seemed excited about the food when we asked for his thoughts on various dishes. The only thing I didn't like was the pacing of the courses. We ordered a bunch of dishes to share and the server said he would course them out for us. But because we were there so early and the kitchen was quiet, the dishes came at us like a barrage. I would have enjoyed a more slowly paced meal."
"Any place with over 3000 yelp reviews is a must for me when traveling, so I set an alarm, made my reservation 2 months in advance, and made it there last week (October 2014). Â Having so much coverage and such a high score set expectations very high, which usually invites an inevitable disappointment, but in this case it met those expectations.The place is so big that I can't imagine you'd be turned away if you called for a reservation same-day. Â I think you'd also do fine if you arrived at opening, or were willing to sit outside on a brisk autumn day. Â Cost/Value: my group of 4 was stuffed and the bill just topped $100 before tax and tip, so I consider that pretty good value. Â I think you could dine even cheaper if you stuck with several of the vegetable dishes, one bread, and 1 or 2 meats. Â If I lived in Chicago, I'd be here frequently, and that's how I'd do it - focusing on the greens.Absolutely order a bread, or maybe 2 with a group of 4 - there is a lot of inventiveness in this, and the result is really tasty (not something I say a lot about bread). Â JOHNNY APPLECHEESE was my choice and it was awesome.For vegetables I had the GREEN BEANS (amazing, as stated often here), the BROCCOLI (grilled and with blue cheese - Ummmmm!). Â I could have easily gone with the cauliflower as a third choice and become an unofficial vegan without even touching a meat dish here, and still given G&TG 5-stars.HAM FRITES were good, but I think they fill the belly a bit much. Â If you only visit here once, you may want to save room for other items. Â On the other hand, if you go with extra veggies, the fries would be a good way to complete the meal. Â But you should save room for meats.NY STRIP TARTARE: amazeballs. Â Not ground meat, but sliced cubes. Â Didn't think I could find as good as in Paris, France, but it was.SUGO: had to look up what this was, and apparently it is a type of Ragu (sauce) made (in this case) with goat, beef and pork. Â The pappardelle noodles are more like lasagna-noodle size, but again it was delicious.CRISP BRAISED PORK SHANK is twice the price of most other dishes, but it's a signature item and it is amazingly tasty. Â I was a little full at this point in the meal to appreciate it completely, but had I avoided the frites this would have been a home-run.If I could have eaten anything more, it would have been the naked cowboy oysters, and the budino dessert that gets such universal raves here. Â But by this point I was stuffed and completely satisfied, with some leftovers to go. Â A perfect meal in a great neighborhood.If you are ever in Miami, the closest ""comparable"" place would be Pubbelly, which I also love."
"Since reservations are ridiculously tough to get at one of the best restaurants in Chicago, sitting in the lounge is an easy and fun way to eat here on a Friday or Saturday night without waiting for hours or planning weeks in advance. The lounge is very chill and has a great vibe. It's not too difficult to get a spot after 9pm. Yo quiero taco bread: 4.5/5 -- Who would have thought that a taco and bread could ever be combined in this fashion? Such flavorful bread with cheddar onion dip and pico de gallo. Very creative. Goat Carpaccio: 3.5/5 -- Good and unique but definitely not the best I have seen at this restaurant. I thought smoked trout and goat would go together well but served cold, it was just okay. Crisp Braised Pork Shank: 5/5 -- Blew my mind. Served with delicious buttermilk dressing and crispy, fluffy naan. Combine the naan, dressing, and pork with your hands. We ordered more naan, because we ran out pretty quickly. Whenever I go to this restaurant, I always say that I have never tried anything like this. That's a true statement every single time! I cannot think of another restaurant so creative and so perfectly executed every single time."
I'm in love with this place. Everything I ate was amazing. The service was fantastic. The atmosphere is wonderful. I'd give them 6 stars if I could.
"Girl & The Goat doesn't miss a step. Wine. Bread. Mains. Dessert. They're all delicious and perfectly prepared and served.Normally I'm against filling up on bread before a meal, but it would be remiss to visit Girl & The Goat without ordering one of the starter loaves of bread. We tried the Johnny Applecheese: made with apple and white cheddar, perfectly crusted on the outside and soft and warm on the inside.The main menu is split into three categories - vegetable, fish and meat - based on the primary ingredient. Dishes are meant to be shared, though they seem more like comfort food than tapas. We started with the pan fried shishito peppers, which were full of flavor, but not necessarily spice (unless you happen upon a rogue pepper). Peppers are prepared with parmesan, sesame and miso to make for an incredibly savory dish.We also ordered the chickpea fritters served with tomatillo-tomato jam and montamore. The fritters were slightly crisp on the outside and pillowy on the inside. The sweet jam and soft, creamy cheese paired nicely.The standout, though, was the Mt. Lassen trout served with pumpkin brandade, fried brussels sprouts, candied pecans and pomegranate seeds. This dish skillfully combines flavors - warm pumpkin, earthy sprouts, tangy pomegranate - and textures - flaky trout, smooth brandade and crispy, crunchy garnishes. It's one of the best dishes I've ever eaten.If you're dining at Girl & The Goat, you need to commit and not skimp on dessert (it's just understood that you'll be more than full when you leave). We sampled both the PB&J and the apple buckle. The PB&J was a deconstructed version of the childhood favorite with brioche doughnuts, salted peanut kulfi and concord grape granita. The PB&J was good, but I much preferred the apple buckle. With warm apples, oatmeal-graham streusel and a heaping scoop of Black Dog brown butter gelato, it was the ultimate fall dessert.What's best about Girl & The Goat is the attention to detail in the restaurant itself and in the kitchen. This level of care creates a dining experience that is high quality without feeling stuffy."
"Top Chef champ Stephanie Izard's Girl & the Goat had been bookmarked as my must visit restaurant for my next visit to Chicago for the longest time!Love that I can secure a reservation through Opentable, though the reservation was for 10 pm on a weekday.Love the deco and the vibe of the interior. Dark and Cozy.We ended up sharing:Girl and the Goatee from Haymarket/A Little Crazy from RevolutionDuck Tongue ($16)Goat Carpaccio ($13)Wood Grilled Oyster ($12)Wood Grilled Broccoli ($10)Goat Empanadas ($16)My first experience of Goat Carpaccios was good. The Empanadas though a little too gamy for me. The Broccoli was amazing and so was the oysters!Duck Tongue was perfect beer snack food!I enjoyed the dish but nothing really wow me enough for me to come back for a repeat visit. The flavours were complex but some of them were not balanced.A good experience overall though!"
"Yea, its as good as all the hype. Â Service was first rate, fast and helpful in answering our questions about the food. Â For our meal we started out with the rustic multigrain bread, and the wood fired oysters. Â I was kinda hoping that the horseradish aoli would have been a bit more horsey, but even without that, each bite was perfectly balanced. Â For our entry we had the pig face, goat empanada and the roasted cauliflower w pickled peppers and pine nuts. Â Still drooling at the memories. Â We struggled with our desert choice and went with the budino. OMG IT WAS AWESOME! Â  Open concept kitchen allowed me the opportunity to walk up and thank the kitchen staff for our wonderful meal!"
I have mixed reviews of this place. The food overall is very good and the atmosphere is perfect for a Friday or Saturday evening out but I've been a couple of times and have had excellent service on one visit and embarrassingly bad service on another.
"Incredibly good food, great service. Pleasant atmosphere for all kinds of gatherings from groups, parties or of the romantic nature. Highly recommended."
"Definitely make reservations in advance!! I made a reservation over a month in advance and barely got a 5:00 slot. After hearing so many good things about this place and how it's Top Chef's Stephanie Izard's restaurant, I was super excited to try this place and had really high expectations. Maybe I expected a little too much because everything we tried was pretty good but I wasn't blown away. My husband and I shared the following:ROASTED CAULIFLOWER w/ pickled peppers, pine nuts, & mint. Good flavor. Great for a side dish. It seems like cauliflower is popping up on every menu nowadays. This one didn't disappoint. Â CHICKPEA FRITTER w/ ratatouille, green goddess, & montamore. Loved the green goddess dressing! A small dish, good for a starter. I'd recommend this one! Pan seared DIVER SCALLOPS w/ smoked uni cream, sugar snaps, bacon plum chimichurri. Yummy! The scallops were cooked perfectly. Had a great flavor too. Wood oven roasted PIG FACE with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple, & potato stix. This is Stephanie Izard's signature dish! And it just sounds so intriguing. Where else are you gonna try pig face?! Overall this dish was delicious! Not gross at all. Don't be afraid to try this one! CONFIT GOAT BELLY w/ bourbon butter, lobster n crab, & fennel. This was my least favorite dish of the night. It wasn't horrible but I didn't want any more after the first bite. I'd say pass on this one. Overall, most of the dishes were good but not amazing. I really liked the space though. The restaurant is spacious and has an industrial yet rustic chic, hipster vibe. I think if this restaurant was in LA, it would be like your average new American hip restaurant in west LA. If you're in Chicago, it's good to try at least once so you can experience it, but I probably wouldn't come back."
"The wood oven pig face and pork shank get all the love, but the real out-of-this world dish is the sauteed green beans with cashews and fish sauce. It will blow you away guaranteed. It's amazing how something that simple can be that great. Really great ambiance and a lot of drink choices here. My only tip would be to make reservations well in advance, as it fills up quickly."
"Although its mainly a seafood definitely my favorite place for breakfast (late) in Chicago! Worth looking into are occasional ""chef's events"" hosted by the executive chef Stephanie Izard. Short summary: open 7 days a week, lots of parking, upscale ambiance and cuisine, prices in general on the higher end but well worth it!"
"So I was finally able to experience dining at Girl & the Goat. This place is so HARD TO GET A RESERVATION. Anyway when the boyfriend knew what weekend I was flying out to Chicago, he made a reservation...and the only one that was available was at 10:45PM! WHO EATS DINNER THAT LATE? hahahah i joke. Anyway, we got to the restaurant at around 10:15 and went to the bar and had I ordered a vodka tonic while the boyfriend ordered a beer. The ambiance was great!Let's just say the night didn't go as planned...the boyfriend had a slight reaction to the beer...and we couldn't funny enjoy the food or the ambiance. So I can't really go in depth about the food experience because it was hampered by the BF's reaction to the beer. We didn't order to many dishes because 1. it was late and 2. the BF wasn't hungry. But here's our order:1. Wood grilled broccoli - This dish was pretty tasty...just i'm not the hugest fan of bleu cheese other than that a pretty interesting dish2. grilled cuttlefish - this was a pretty great dish i love me some cuttlefish! The ice lettuce that it came with balanced out the seafood-y flavor of the cuttlefish. YUM3.grilled marinated pork belly - i think out of all the dishes this must have been my favorite. it was super great and all the dressings on the side (castelfranco - ""sauce green"" - and blood orange) really complete this dish.I'd love to go back to Girl & the Goat and be able to get the full enjoyable experience."
I went here last night and sat at the bar. Everything was excellent but the baby octopus blew me away. Lots of other people who came by themselves and had a lot of fun talking with everybody. One of the best meals in a real long time
"I made sure I got a reservation to Girl & the Goat once I knew I was visiting Chicago. 3 months in advance and well worth it. Among the three of us, we ordered the duck tongue, hamachi crudo, goat liver mousse, chickpeas fritters, beef tatare, octopus, and beef hearts. All I can say is that this is one of of the best meals I had in a long time. Every dish had explosion of flavors and textures. Everything I ate, I shook my head in disbelief, telling my friends that this is some AMAZING food.Come here and try as many dishes as possible. You will be blown away...and not because it's Chicago."
"The hype was real! Every dish that we ordered were tasty! Small portions but filling. Made reservations 3 mos ahead (before our vacation) and it's worth it. Came with 8 other people, each one ordered different dish and just shared - which I recommend."
"Came here on Saturday night- long wait in front, so we chose the table in waiting area. Ordered drinks- tasty. Pig face- Love it!!Dessert- ice cream made of goat milk- nice."
"Sooooo much has been said about this place, I almost feel like I shouldn't bother to review. But this is my favorite restaurant of all time, so let me give a couple of hints and tips:-Get reservations or get ready to be waiting at the door when they open. Start planning at least three months ahead.-Parking is horrid, even with the valet service. Take a taxi or public transit. -I've seen people in formal dresses and I've seen people in jeans eat here. The waitstaff wears t-shirts, but the food suggests you should at least put on a blouse. -Get bread, even if it sounds like the most plebeian thing in the world. The things this place can do with butter are otherworldly. The bread has been my favorite part of every meal here.-Go here. Just do it. Shell out the money, it's well worth it. This will be one of the best meals of your life."
"It took me a while to get to Girl & the Goat but ever since we stopped by, we haven't been able to get enough. Â The first time, it was so packed that we ended sitting in the lounge area which was great in its own way. Â Stellar service and food by their staff, great conversation with other guests. Â The second time, we got a table because we swung by after a show at Lyric Opera. Â Same amazing experience but just at a table. Â We have yet to find something that we don't like!"
Amazing. Not just a dinner but an experience! Worth the two month wait. Definately try the pig face. But the cocktails are delicious too.
"My wife and I just had the most amazing experience at Girl and the Goat. We were told we had the most fun seat in the house as we were seated. Our seats were along the counter near the wood fired grill. The hostess wasn't joking, it was so much fun. Our waitress, Leigh, was awesome, so friendly, and made the best recommendations! The kitchen staff were amazing and put on one heck of a show! The staff here is top notch! We order the kohlrabi salad, which features kohlrabi, olives, mushroom, fennel, evalon, and apples. It started out oniony but finished savory and earthy with the mushrooms and olives. I like it. Next, we had the beef short ribs with avocado and grapefruit chermoula. Wow!!! The beef cut like butter, and mixed with the citrus of the grapefruit along with the avocado and radish was INCREDIBLE!After watching the guys in the kitchen churn out an untold number of the Pan Fried Shishito Peppers, I had to have them. Pan roasted, slightly spicy, covered in Parmesan cheese, miso aioli, and sesame seeds. Smoky, savory, spicy goodness left me so happy! Wood Grilled Broccoli followed. It was smoky, savory, and delicious with blue cheese and spiced crispies. Loved how the broccoli was totally infused with wood fired, smoky flavor! As a surprise the kitchen presented us with grilled marinated pork belly. Wow! First, the cutting board presentation was phenomenal. The pork belly paired with green sauce and blood orange was amazing! I couldn't stop eating it!For desert we had the plantain cake and miso-butterscotch budino. The plantain cake was great, but I would consider selling a kidney for another bite of the miso-butterscotch budino. It was like tasting the freedom of the beach for the first time as an adult. It was a good experience that brought you back to a place you never thought food would take you. And we're so happy for it!!! I'll definitely be back and I can't wait for the next time! An amazing experience! Chef Izard and her culinary companions will take you on a epic culinary journey that is unlike anything you've ever experienced, and I can't wait for the next course!"
This is the best food experience I have ever had. The chickpea fritters were full of unique flavor combinations. The pigs face was presented nicely and was delicious when all the flavors were mixed together. The wait staff was amazing specially the food runners and the bus boys. We always received our food when it was hot and our water was always full.
"This is the place that everyone raves about and it definitely did not disappoint! Â I couldnt call to make a reservation since they open at 5 so YELP was so handy that I made reservations online and it was so simple! Â I got a confirmation and everything! Â This place is pretty high end and I thought I would have to dress nice but it is a very casual place. Â Very cute, romantic, but can get pretty loud! Â I came here with my bro, sis, and cousin at 6:30 and we were seated right away. Â Our server was very helpful because we wanted to get so many things and is very knowledgeable about how much food we should order. Â With her help, we ordered the perfect amount! Â We all shared:Corn Fed Bread ($4)0 goat cheese butter, corn relish. Â This was an okay appetizer. Â Just your typical bread and butter. Â The cheese however was great!Chickpea Fritters ($13)- These were the best veggie appetizers that we had! Â So crispy that even meat lovers would love it!Sauteed grean beans ($9) This is good after a couple of bites but if you eat a lot, it seems kind of saltyHamachi crude ($16) crisp pork belly, chili aioli, caperberries. Â This dish did NOT seem like $16 bucks because there was just very little on the placeWood Oven roasted pig face ($16)- sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato sticks. Â This was super delicious! Â Wish there was a little more though. Â the face was so tender!Crisp braised pork shank ($25)- buttermilk dressing, stone fruit cimchee, naan. Â Best meat dish we ordered that night! Â The meat just falls of the bone and it is so juicy and tender! Â I definitely recommend this over the roasted pig face! Â Overall, good place but I probably won't come back here since it definitely leaves a hole in your pants!"
"I've been here twice now and have had top shelf experiences each time. I've been around to a ton of restaurants in the city and this is the absolute best experience I've had. Â Not to mention you can have an amazing time for under $100 for two. Â Most recently I came in with a group of four with reservations. Â Wait staff was great, explained the menu and didn't rush us at all with our selections. If you're coming in with four people you can pretty much sample half the menu. Â That is the best part about a place like this with small plates. Â You don't feel like you're stuck with any single plate and it's a fun experience sharing everything as the plates come to your table. We ended up ordering octopus, pierogi, peppers, curry bread, goat belly, ham fries, escargot ravioli, short rib, and pig face and chickpea fritters.Not only did we order all of that, everyone was able to get a decent serving of each. Â We were all pretty full at the end. Â The service was spot on as it seemed like the moment we finished one plate the next was being set down. The pig face was amazing. Think meaty bacon. Â The goat belly was so tender it was the highlight for everyone. Â And the ham frites were the most unique fries I've had. They were dusted with the essence of ham. Â I could comment on every single dish as there was not a dud among anything I mentioned. Â You can pretty much throw darts at the menu and you'll go home happy. Â So if you're even considering reserving a table at a place like wildfire or Joe's crab shack or buca di beppo just stop, don't do that. Â Go here and you'll thank me later."
"First stop off the plane was straight to Girl & the Goat.It's sharing style and the waiter recommended 4 dishes for 2 people and that was the perfect amount. We tried the shisito peppers which is covered in parm cheese. Beets, which were different from the usual and mixed with anchovy, avocado sauce, and bread crumbs. The escargot ravioli lived up to its hype. The pig face was good... like a breakfast hash but not as mind blowing as I expected. Wish I had a second stomach to try more.The drinks were solid with the Italian grandpa being my favorite. It's like a negroni. Great atmosphere."
This is our second time here.... And I'm still in love...I'm a foodie... And I have to say that this is truly my favorite restaurant....
"Wow. I came here for a friend's birthday dinner, and boy, am I glad we're friends. I still can't believe how she got reservations for so many people. Instead dining in the noisy, crowded upstairs area, we were guided downstairs into a private wine room with a huge table. It was an intimate, special place where you could already get a sense of the food you were about to eat. We had so much delicious food. I can't even begin to describe. There wasn't a dish that I disliked. We started off with assorted breads. The cheddar bread was my favorite, but there was also one with tzatziki sauce and hummus, and another with peanut butter butter and some berry sauce.The assorted olives were delicious! Not to salty and a great variety makes me a happy girl. A nice refreshing dish is the kohlrabi salad. A perfect combination of crunch and sweetness, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish. The grilled sepia is wonderful. The flavors are all there. Another favorite was the chickpea fritter. Crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I personally love cauliflower, so that dish was amazing for me. The goat leg was good-- I've never had goat before-- but I'd rather stick to the rest. I think I may also have been way to full by this point to thoroughly enjoy it. Dessert was also yummy. The lemon cake was one of the best I've had. There were so many others I can't even remember. They were all very innovative. One even had goat cheese ice cream. Definitely worth the trip and wait. Try and make reservations!"
The food here is SUPER good but it is also SUPER loud. Â Came with the boyfriend and we just kept giving thumbs up to each other. Â But we couldn't actually talk or carry a conversation. Â Drinks are good too. Â Recommend the goat empanadas and chick pea fritters.
"I've been waiting to dine here for months. My family and I had a reservation at 4:30 pm on a Saturday. We got to the restaurant and found that it was already packed. Reservations go out for months so plan a date to dine here early and make that reservation especially if you're coming from out of town.Our server, Emily was very helpful and gave us an overview of the restaurant and suggested dishes to try. Of the dishes we had, my favorites are the baby octopus, marinated pork belly, halibut, beef tongue and the goat shank. The meat dishes were all so tender and the halibut was cooked perfectly! For dessert, we tried the miso butterscotch budino which had candied cashews and pineapple! IT WAS GREAT! Definitely a must to dine here!"
"Food is out of this world! Make sure to make a reservation! My boyfriend and I had our favorite meal of all time here, we always talk about it and going back."
"Now I know why it's always been impossible to get reservations to this place: Girl & the Goat was awesome. One of the best non-Michillen-stared restaurants I've ever been to. I'd recommend everyone in Chicago or traveling to Chicago to go to Girl and the Goat. Ordering here is a bit ""tapas-like"" - order a few different things and share. I'll list what we got, and rate each from 1-10Oysters: 10/10Beet salad: 10/10Shishito peppers: 8/10 Grilled octopus: 9/10""Pig face"": 8/10Pork Belly: 8/10Bay scallops: 10/10Goat carpaccio: 10/10Goat empinada: 9/10Cheese selection: 9/10PBJ dessert: 8/10Chocolate and shiitake dessert: 9/10Miso and pineapple dessert: 10/10Girl & the Goat is a place you have to go to. Food, service, atmosphere all great. I was blown away by the quality of this place, and can't wait to go back next trip to Chicago."
"I'm on the fence between 3 & 4 stars for Girl & the Goat. Awesome service. Food's great but not amazing in my opinion. I've heard a lot of good things about this place & everything on the menu sounded amazing so I think my expectations were just too high. If I had to wait for a table, it would've not been worth it; luckily I was able to grab a seat in the bar area right when I arrived. Ordered too much food again but what's new?!? haha~hamachi crudo w/ crisp pork belly, chili aioli, caperberries - fresh hamachi; the whole dish is kind of bland for me~ escargot ravioli w/ bacon & tamarind-miso sauce - delicious! this has to be my favorite dish ~ ny strip tartare w/ smoke uni, apple, shiitake, popiah - pretty good but I couldn't really taste the uni~ braised beef tongue w/ masa, beef vinaigrette, salsa verde - refreshing salad w/ thinly sliced beef tongueValet or street parking only. Beautiful interior. Full bar."
"Dlicious. Highly recommend this place. It's a restaurant where you share plates with your friends. I dined alone :( but the restaurant offer 1/2 portion for single diners. (But selected items on the menu) I wanted to try pig face, but they wouldn't do 1/2 portion so I didn't order it. (It's supposed to be amazing. I will order next time) -Grilled octopus - tender octopus, great flavor-Escargot ravioli - yum -Goat empanadas - delicious-Hamachi - it was good, but I'm used to very simple flavors with Hamachi since the fish has such a great taste. The sauce they had was little overwhelming and fried pork bits were good but not with hamachi. I think it killed the natural beauty of hamachi. So I would not order this again."
"Girl & the Goat is an amazing spot, and at almost 4000 reviews, it should be! Â The restaurant is very hipster and has a dark lit atmosphere. Â To eat here will set you back about an hour or so wait, even with a reservation, however we go really lucky to find a spot at the bar and got seating almost immediately, which we later passed on to someone else who did the same thing. Â The shank is a must here as well as the roasted cauliflower. Â Their renowned top chef really knows how to make a great dish. Â Had a great experience here and recommend to any local or tourist."
"Now, I was lucky enough to come twice to this elusive hotspot without any struggles: once, for a work team dinner and the second, on a whim, after my roommates colleague couldn't make her reservation. Normally, the waitlist is three months long, which sounds painful and risky to me. When I went for my work dinner, at 9 pm, they didn't seat us until 9:30 because they were still wrapping up with another party, which was fine because we just had drinks at the bar. For the food, we ordered around two of around 17 dishes (one version had to be nondairy for a coworker) and everyone had a couple bites of each dish.Amazing and I can see why people rave about this Chicago must! Top standouts go to the fried egg topped pig face, of course, crispy duck tongue, the buttery goat belly lobster n crab, and pb&j. When I went with my roommate, it was hard to just order a couple of dishes, but hands down, my favorite dish was the NY strip tartare! The mushroom elevated the pants off this dish.Obviously, Girl and the Goat is a meal you can only treat yourself to once in a while, but I recommend going in a larger group and eating family style. I hope to return again!"
"The first time I ate here was for our anniversary. And it definitely lived up to all the hype we had been hearing! We are pretty adventurous eaters, so we will try anything. After the waiter introduced himself and showed that he was knowledgeable about the menu, we requested that he choose five of his favorite dishes, and course them out for us. It was a great decision! We went back again not too long ago with a group for my birthday, and sat at the chef's table. The ten of us shared everything we got, and everything was tasty! And we all left extremely full. Can't wait for my next visit!"
"After reading all the reviews I was very excited to try this place! Reservations: Tried unsuccessfully to make a week day dinner reservation about a week in advance. The hostess kindly suggested stopping in early in the week and try for a walk in table which we did. We arrived about 5:45pm on a Tuesday and were offered immediate outdoor seating. We opted to wait for inside seating and after about 20 minutes we were able to snag seats at the bar.Seating: Reserved seating is obviously the best, but there is also a good amount of first come, first served seating at the bar and you can also order food in the lounge area by the entrance. There are two additional pairs of bar style seating in the back at either end of the kitchen (I believe also first come, first served) that provide a great view of the chefs at work and a bit more privacy than the seats at the main bar. If I came without reservations again I'd go for these kitchen view seats!Food:Johnny Applecheese bread with chili-cheddar butter and malted oil: Our bread came out fresh and piping hot! My friend and I really liked the chili-cheddar butter, malted oil was whatevs. Recommended.Wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg: A mix of crispy and soft textures, rich and flavorful. Sunny side egg is great on anything! Smaller portion. Would recommend this slightly above the pork shank for flavor and uniqueness.Crisp braised pork shank with buttermilk dressing, butternut shiitake and naan bread: You get a lot of tender meat with this dish which literally falls right off the bone! Buttermilk dressing was a little bit like a raunch sauce (good). Naan bread was just perfect, warm and crispy with a soft inside. You'll definitely want to share this with 2-3 people. Recommended.Roasted cauliflower: This was maybe the most surprising dish of the evening. The cauliflower was very well seasoned and had a nice peppery flavor. Very hearty and a surprisingly large portion, would also suggest sharing this with 2-3 people. Recommended.Our service at the bar was good and we didn't have to wait long for each dish to come out. Kitchen staff appears to be working very efficiently!Overall, glad I tried it but I don't feel the need to eat here again in the very near future."
"OMG! This place had a high bar to reach and did not disappoint. We love enjoying small plates to share and restaurants who aspire to do so should take note of how it's done here. Unusual combinations of ingredients come alive in perfect balance on your palate. Â (Goat empanadas with avocado and blueberries? Perfection! Roasted pork with homemade naan, nectarine kimchi? Delectable!) creative cocktails. Good wine list selection. We were seated a few minutes prior to our reservation and the service was highly attentive without being annoying. Great job chef Stephanie Izard!!!"
"Reasonably priced, and on a trip to Chigaco where the culinary experiences were the focus, Girl and Goat delivered the most memberable. We tried everything, and it was all great. Â Strategy for getting in with no resi, was to just come early @545 and we could have had a seat (from what I could tell) until 630."
"After a return visit, I'm bumping Girl & the Goat up to 5 stars. We went as a group and split a large table near the kitchen. Although I mourn the loss of the amazing striped bass in mushroom mole, I like that their menu changes from time to time. The back of one waiter's shirt read ""what happens at the goat stays at the goat,"" but our experience at the goat was too good not to share. Shrimp 'n grits bread ($4): their breads are inventive and delicious, and this was no exception. Warm, slightly sweet cornmeal-based loaf (not cornbread) with whipped shrimp butter and an onion relish. Honey sambal brioche ($4): the shrimp 'n grits was fantastic, but this was over the top. One of the best breads I've ever had, the brioche was melt-in-your-mouth (yes, melt-in-your-mouth bread) even without the whipped honey butter. I didn't think anything could top the challah back we had last time, but this did. The citrusy corn/pomelo relish was a great addition as well. I'm not a carb person, but I could eat this all day with or without the butter!Shishito peppers ($7): just as good as last time, the parmesan/sesame/miso/butter combination adds a lot of salt and umami-ness, and the crust on top is incredible.Roasted cauliflower ($11): seems deceptively simple, but it's definitely the best preparation of cauliflower I've ever had, and one of the best vegetable dishes I've tried. I love that the cauliflower is slightly crispy and firm, I'd have describe it as a perfect al dente. The pickled peppers add some nice acidity and the pine nuts and mint help balance out the panko butter (?) that the cauliflower is sauteed in. If I had a complaint, it would be that it was edging on too salty, but still a must-try.Pierogies ($15): these were devoured before I had a chance to try any, but I had some of the yogurt sauce with kimchi butter which was terrific. There was a hint of orange in there, brilliant choice to balance out all the richness.Goat liver mousse ($14): another big winner, the patÃ© was expectedly smooth, strong, and goaty with a thin layer of pork jelly on top. The buttery crumpets could not get any better, perfect for spreading that rich mousse on. The house pickles were good, pickled kumquat was salty and bittersweet at the same time, but those pickled smoked mushrooms were amazing. Never tasted mushrooms like this before.Duck tongues ($16): Another must try, I'll definitely be getting this again along with the cauliflower. The tongues were deep fried but extremely tender and rich, and combined perfectly with the piri piri (birdseye chili based sauce). The wonton strips added some more crunch and paired really nicely with the terrific tuna/black bean poke. In the end, I alternated between one bite of crispy tongue and one bite with just tuna tartare/wonton. Both go really well with the piri piri.Confit goat belly ($19): only tried a tiny bit of this. Belly is tender and less fatty than you'd imagine, more like a short rib in meat/fat distribution and texture. The goat is good but not great, and small in portion. The real standout was a small bite of crab and fennel in the boozy bourbon butter.Plantain cake ($8): thought this was just all right compared to the rest of the meal. I only had a little bit, but I didn't love the cream cheese/chocolate gelato and the cake itself, while moist and banana-y, wasn't anything to write home about. The milky passion fruit sauce was tart, tangy and delicious, best part of the dish.Date cake ($8): I love the pomegranate ice and candied, toasted pine nuts, but in the end the date cake, like the plantain cake, just ended up being a vessel to soak up all of its delicious components on the side. I wish the cake itself had stronger date flavors or even chopped dates in it.Miso butterscotch budino ($8): Now this is where it's at. If you're going to get dessert(s), get the budino. The butterscotch pudding was smooth, sweet and salty and the bacon toffee and candied cashews play into the sweet/savory theme perfectly. Somehow, the crunchy diced pineapple works really well here. I could eat this dessert every day!Overall, I wouldn't hesitate to come to Girl & the Goat anytime if tables were more readily available. It's a great way to try imaginative, impeccably prepared contemporary American food without breaking the bank - especially if you're into miso and pickled vegetables of all varieties. I'll definitely be back to see what else Stephanie Izard comes up with."
"As an out-of-towner, I've been lucky to have been to Girl and the Goat twice so far! They have tables reserved for walk in's. So get in early for a better chance of a table. Everything is good! They also serve half portions for single travelers! The Pig Face is a must have! Chickpea Fritter and Grilled Octopus are also delicious! Definitely a must in Chicago!"
"Luckily we got a special reservation to hook us up. Worth every calorie. We have the fried oyster, the multigrain bread, the cauliflower, broccoli, chickpea fritter, and the pork shank. All were amazing. Worth every calorie."
"Sooooo good. Pricey, but thats what you should expect.it also takes a while to get in, but worth the wait."
"I get the hype for sure! So Â many options, so many flavors (in a good way) and so fantastic! I want the cauliflower everyday of my life and the chickpea fritters are to die for... and the goat belly.. mmm... I just could go on and on..."
"Loved this place!! The food was exceptional as was the service!! I loved the green beans so much that I often make a similar version of them for dinner! The fritters, the lamb, and ooooo the desserts! Make sure to make reservations."
"We finally went here to see if the hype was worth it as took more than 5 months to obtain dinner reservation. Â I think this is a good restaurant and liked everything that we sampled. Â We had a large spread of food based upon our waitress' recommendations. Â I don't remember all the dish names, but all were delicious. Â There wasn't a dish that we didn't like. Â I'll definitely be back to try more items. Â Service and atmosphere were excellent. Â Congratulations to Top Chef Stephanie on her successes!"
My bf and I waited months to get in and it was worth it. Â Loved the menu and atmosphere. Get in early before it gets packed. Highly recommend the pigs face and the oysters
"Extremely poor service!! No kids menu. Food not consistently good. I think the popularity has gone into their head. Stephanie thinks cooking should be fun but I guess service is not her restaurant's forte.We called for reservation and were told we can walk in at opening time 4:30 and should not have difficulty finding spot. Then, few days later we reached parking lot at 4:30pm during weekday and called to confirm availability and were told there was no wait as they just opened. Then, we reached restaurant at 4:35pm to be told that there was no availability and we can sit in lounge to eat - while there were more than half the tables empty. It was very upsetting because we drove an hour from suburbs to get there and we had just confirmed availability. I felt that they were discriminating because we were Indians and not whites! However, after complaining about the service, the guy in front gave us an outside seating sitting next to another group. Then we found out that they don't have any kids menu!! So we had to settle with simple butter pasta for our daughter. Also, the chicken I ordered had good crispy skin but was high on salt. That's when I eat more salt than avg Joe!Anyways, I could live with food but I cannot tolerate discriminating attitude, which is getting more and more common in popular Chicago restaurants and I have decided to leave a review for restaurants that behave this way."
"What to say that has not already been said:1. They seat until midnight. Â Bless you Ms. Izard.2. They have a separate menu for those with dairy allergies. Â Much appreciated.3. Some of the food is over inventive and misses the mark - almond butter under the halibut - no thanks.4. The staff is overly attentive. Â (I do not need someone reaching into the middle of my conversation just to turn my 1/2 consumed bottle of beer two inches so the label is facing me. Â There is good service and there is unneeded, over the top service.)5. Go here if you want to eat at a restaurant that also doubles as a trendy bar scene. Â It feels like a loud party in there and at 42 I felt like an old fart. Â 6. Pappardelle was out of sight. Â I will certainly return and try more of the menu."
"This is my second visit to Girl & the Goat and it just keeps getting better! There is a reason this is one of the top restaurants in Chicago! (and one of the hardest to get into. Luckily, I made my reservation almost two months prior to my trip to Chicago and was delighted with a quick drink at the bar and promptly seated. The staff was again, top notch. We started with my favorite from last time, the Naked Cowboy Oysters. These are ridiculous good. I could seriously eat a bucket of these little tasty bites.We also got the ham frites and the chickpea fritters. Both great. They offer a half order of the frites which was still a large serving, especially for just two of us. They were good, but probably my least favorite of the night. The chickpea fritters, were outstanding. Next came the green beans. I love vegetables, but it's rare that I'm going to say that a veggie was my favorite dish of the night. But these green beans...kicked some serious ass. The flavor was ah-mazing. We ended with the pork shank and it was (literally) fall off the bone good. We skipped dessert in favor of finishing off our bottle of wine. While I don't expect a cheap meal when I go here, it was still reasonably priced for what we ate. I will continue to go here again and again and again. Just wish I lived a tad closer!!"
"Love the girl. Love the goat. I loved everything about the restaurant, from the creative, elevated menu, to the cool, industrial, relaxed atmosphere. It's tapas style, so the server recommend we do 2 dishes per guest ($10-$20 each). We went with the Goat empanadas, beat salad, Sugo, pig face, duck tongues - all delicious and presented beautifully. The butterscotch dessert was hands down the best butterscotch dish I've ever tasted and one of the best desserts. I will definitely be back... And I can't wait..."
Always excellent. Â The Staff got it nailed.
The place is loud but offers unique menu. I am not a fan of greasy food and loud music so the pig face dish is a no for me. Other dishes are good though.
"We've all heard the buzz about Girl and the Goat, where Top Chef Stephanie Izard serves innovative small plates in a dramatic open kitchen. We've been to little sister Little Goat more times than we can count. We've even made those magic beans, steamed in a fish sauce vinaigrette and topped with Asian-inspired aioli, in our own kitchens. Does Girl and the Goat still deserve a prominent place on our list of restaurants to try? Yes!On a snowy night in February, I finally tried the restaurant that started it all. I'd recommend going with a group of friends, allowing you to sample practically everything on the menu; although I know people who have snagged seats at the bar in under an hour, you'll want to make a reservation for a group.Our party of six tried 12 dishes, all made magical with swoon-worthy sauces and toppings. Although we didn't order a single dud, I think the goat dishes and vegetable sides really stole the show:- Goat empanadas with queso fresco, grilled mushroom giardiniera and huacatay, a mint-like herb related to the marigold flower- Confit goat belly topped with bourbon-spiked butter, fennel, and a little lobster and crab- Roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint- Indian-influenced chickpea fritters with garam masala, romanesco, rosemary-tamarind yogurt, and green mangoI was pleasantly surprised by our bill, too! Splitting the bill between us, I paid $50 for a filling meal with one glass of wine."
"Ordered the crab Rangoon-style squash blossoms and seasonal specialty halibut (marcona almond butter, etc.). Sat at the bar. Service was a bit snooty (and that's by San Francisco standards). Guess they take themselves pretty seriously. If only the food trumped the crappy service. Oh well. Don't expect much beyond Midwestern hype and mediocre ""Gastropub"" fare. Save your money, travel west, and spend it in a place such as Martin's West in Redwood City, CA."
Met up with a couple of great friends. Good food even though I don't eat goat. Portions are small for big eaters though. Drinks were great: Big fan of the The Best Of Three!! Â Dessert was yummy: Get The Sticky Date Cake!! Nice concept. Great for groups but be aware that reservations are a plus. It's a hot spot!
"Fantastic. The food was wonderful, out server was very knowledgeable and even brought us an extra dish that was made by mistake. I ordered my typical old fashioned to drink and it was one of the best I've had. Completely lives up to its hype and would go again and again."
"I've been here twice and both times were perfection in terms of service and food. So far me and my friends have tried:1) Honey sambal brioche5/5. The bread was fluffy and delicious enough to eat on its own. Add honey sambal butter and some relish to that - perfect starter2) Crispy beef short ribs3/5. This was served on top of avocado and some salad which was acidic - nice way to cut through the fattiness of the avocado and round the dish up. We liked it a lot, but I'm giving it a 3 only because there were other dishes that left more of an impression3) Scallops5/5. The scallops were cooked to perfection - nicely salted and the charred top was crunchy. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good seafood dish. I really don't think you would be disappointed4) Pan fried shishito peppers3/5. These were also nice to try and sort of unique! If you wanted to try a ""new"" vegetable dish here with a large group, this might be it. However, it gets only a 3 in comparison to the rest (sorry I'm not sorry)5) Country fried loup de mer 4/5. The portion arrived larger than we expected! Fish was fried to perfection and the salad/rice nicely complemented the dish. I would've enjoyed this more if I wasn't stuffing my face with (7) - don't skip the list yet!6) Goat medallions2/5. I had this more than a year ago and it doesn't seem to be on the menu anymore (good). It was too rare for my liking and just pales in comparison to whatever else I was pigging on. I honestly just remembered I did not enjoy this. 7) Roasted cauliflower6/5! I cannot comprehend how a dish this simple can be so satisfying and addictive (and not to mention, that has a recipe openly shared by Izzard herself!). This is the granddaddy of them ALL. I would say one portion is good for a group of 4. Please don't deprive yourself by sharing this with too many people. I would NEVER go to Girl and the Goat and NOT order this. 8) Miso butterscotch budino5/5. BACON TOFFEE. It was savory and sweet (both in the right amounts), and pretty unique! Also another one I would definitely get if I were able to get a reservation tomorrow. Apart from this and the free birthday dessert (ice-cream brownie that tasted like truffles? not bad but wouldn't order it on my own... sorry :( ), I've not tried any other dessert. It's going to be a challenge to not order this miso one though.Can't wait for my next visit! Till then, lots of time at the gym."
I enjoyed it a lot!
"The pig face entree and bunito dessert were both amazing. Our bartender Justin made the experience a 10 out of 5 stars. He was so knowledgeable about the food, helpful friendly basically I love him. He is the coolest"
"Sophisticated mixture of texture with unusual pairings. Â Balanced. Â At least 2 complementary flavors. Â I still think it's an excellent value for $$. Â 5 dishes for 2 persons was gluttony, plus bread and dessert.Worthy hearty bigger portions (or grew by 10%):- summertom bread ($4)- shishito peppers ($7) is still the best in town and addictive - octopus ($15) is mixed with bacon and nuts- escargot ravioli ($15) is plentiful- date cake ($8) is perfectly balanced and uniqueLean, ""that's it?"", ""how much?"" portion:- 1 soft shell crab ($14)- Kalbi ribs ($16)- Stumptown Coffee ($4/cup)Service and cleanup with multiple plate replacements is unwaveringly great! Â The more to enjoy flavors as created.Venue is loud and table spacing is tight (NY style, pull out table)."
"There are times when a 5 star rating is well deserved and I can't even put a shadow of doubt around it. This one goes on my list of top restaurants not only in Chicago, but in the world (or at least the parts I've visited).Came here on a Thursday evening a little past 5pm and was able to find a seat at the bar very easily. There were several others available. The music, the service, the vibe, just spectacular. Amazingly, although packed, it wasn't too loud. The noise level was very reasonable and I can see this being an awesome place to take a date. Of course, good luck getting a reservation, you'll need to plan. Food wise, don't even get me started. The menu is filled with delicacies. As I've taken a sneak peak at the other yelp reviews, got the pig face. It was nice and fatty, reminded me of pork belly flavor with more texture to it. The duck tongues were also delicious. Basically, you will really have to go out of your way to find something that isn't tasty on this menu. To summarize, a must go to place in Chicago."
"I recently moved to Chicago and I've had numerous people tell me to visit Girl and the Goat while I'm here. Not only that, I watch Top Chef and (very recently) The Taste and the guest mentor and judge on one of the episodes was Chef Stephanie Izard so I was ecstatic when I was able to get a reservation in for my sister's birthday this past weekend. I booked two weeks in advance and we got a table for 10:45 PM on a Saturday. Â This place was kind of like tapas style, small dishes, so we ordered one item from each category (Bread, Oyster, Goat, Vegetable, Seafood, Meat, Dessert):Herbs of a FetaFried Naked CowboysChickpea FritterPan Roasted MonkfishWood Oven Roasted Pig FaceConfit Goat BellyCitrus PavlovaMiso-Butterscotch BudinoFor the bread, we ordered the Herbs of a Feta. Crispy on the outside and so soft on the inside. You can taste the herbs. I loved the hummus and dipping the bread into the feta oil. So tasty and great aroma. After the bread, we had the Fried Naked Cowboys. I was hesitant about ordering this at first. I like my oysters raw. I usually don't appreciate it any other way but raw. My sister, however, doesn't eat raw oysters and the waiter said his favorite was the Fried Naked Cowboys. When it came out, it already looked so good. Each oyster was on a spoon already with the egg salad and capers. Mmmm it was one delicious, flavorful bite!Next up was the DELICIOUS Chickpea Fritter. Wow. I HAVE to learn how to make this because I know I can't keep coming back every weekend just for this one dish. The outside was so crispy and when you bite into it, the chickpea filling was SO soft. The texture was perfect. Mixed with the other stuff in the bowl and it's the perfect vegetable dish. This was my sister's and my favorite of the night. We love chickpea (hence the hummus with the bread and then this dish with chickpea too).For the fish/seafood, we tried the Monkfish. This was good but we didn't talk about it after dinner, like the way we would about the things we absolutely loved. We talked about the next time we would try the other stuff under their seafood section, like the Hamachi Crudo, Striped Bass or the Scallops so the Monkfish didn't blow us away or we would talk about that instead, but it was still good. Majority of the reviews mentioned the Pig Face. This dish is special because you cannot find it at most ""American"" places. It's common at certain Asian places. This was wood oven roasted and you can taste it too. It smelled so good. The meat was crispy and had fatty areas so it balanced really well. It was topped off with a sunny side egg. Move the egg over a bit and cut it so the yolk falls on top of the meat and eat it altogether, with the other stuff on the plate. It's a really great bite. If you cut it with the egg sitting on top, the way it's brought out, then the yolk will just fall to the sides and onto the plate itself, not the meat. Next up was the Confit Goat Belly. This was delicious, not because the star was the goat belly, but because they also had lobster, crab and fennel with the dish. Cut up a piece of the goat belly, add a piece of the lobster and crab, then scrape the food with the bourbon butter on the plate, and eat it all in one bite. The flavors were there. The texture worked. This was the perfect bite of surf and turf.On a side note, the table next to us was raving about their Goat Empanadas. I heard the lady say the Goat Empanadas were the best empanadas they have ever had. I'll try that next time, but thought it was still worth mentioning on here.After the food, it was time for dessert! At this point, we were craving for something sweet so it was perfect timing. We wanted something fruity and ordered the Citrus Pavlova. Wow. I could eat this ALL DAY. There were so many different components in this bowl. There was blood orange, yuzu curd, ice cream, kumquats, this thing that was like vanilla meringue (I have to learn how to make this!). This was PERFECT after all the other dishes. The next thing was probably an even more perfect ending to an amazing meal. Since it was my sister's birthday, they brought out a small serving of the Miso-Butterscotch Budino (bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, candied cashews) on the house. This was the most amazing dessert. I was about to lick the miso-butterscotch off the wooden board it was served to us on, but I refrained from doing so. 2-3 days later, my sister and I are STILL talking about the ice cream, the yuzu curd, the miso-butterscotch with the toffee and the pineapple chunks.Yup, we are definitely going back. Really soon. Need to try everything else on their menu!"
"Making our reservations, months in advance I had such high hopes for this place. Â I was really let down by the food. Â It was just ok, but nothing blew my mind. Â We were seated on the other side of a glass partition from the bar, which was super annoying because people kept looking at our food and asking us questions while we were eating. Â They really shouldn't have seating there. Â As far a service goes, we were in and out in under an hour. Â I've been to many restaurants with long waits, and I have never been rushed like that in my entire life. Â I felt like we had no time to enjoy our food because they were bringing out dishes so quickly. Â We were shoveling food down our throats before the next dish arrived. Â I suggested the owners visit Parachute because they are just as busy and don't rush you out the door. Â Plus their food is way better. Â We started with the taco bread, which was delicious, but sadly the highlight of our eating experience here. Â We also ordered the stuffed squash blossoms, goat empanadas, green garlic pierogies, the pig face, chickpea fritters, and the octopus. Â Everything was just ok. Â If I didn't know it was goat, I wouldn't be able to tell it apart from any other protein. Â It lack any discernible flavor. Â The octopus was very disappointing. Â I'm all for char in my food, but this was burnt, and and acrid burnt flavor took over the entire dish. Â Everything else was just ok."
"This place was another place in Chicago, which allowed walk-ins but hard to get a seat. We were lucky to be able to seated outside. However, the weather was so bad and it started raining very hard during our dinner. The restaurant staff were able to seat us near the kitchen afterwards. We ordered the following items:- goat cheese & sweet corn dumplings (eggplant zaalouk . tzatziki . peach . sungold)- goat carpaccio (smoked trout roe . olive-maple vinaigrette)- grilled baby octopus (guanciale . fava beans . pistachios . lemon vinaigrette)- wood oven roasted pig face (sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stix)- roasted cauliflower (pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint)Everything was very good here. However, we felt a little bit rushed at the end."
"Had such an amazing dinner at Girl & the Goat with my brother, sister in law and parents a couple weeks ago. Â There wasn't one thing I had that I didn't enjoy. Â The great thing about this restaurant are their terrific veggies. Â I have never had such awesome cauliflower. Â Crazy, but of all the things we had that was my favorite thing! Â next time I am getting my own bowl, no sharing!! Â The ham frites were also excellent as we had to get 2 orders. Â Oh and the challah bread was also so good. Â Nice and warm with a great crust and served salmon cream cheese. Â It was amazing. I was only mad my dad kept eating it. Â We had a bunch of other things - short ribs, duck, escargot ravioli and one of the fish dishes. Â All were great.The customer service here is lovely. Â We had such a nice server who put up with my dad who is not used to eating at restaurants where pig's face is served. Â Additionally, they sent my brother signed menus signed by Stephanie b/c she was not at the restaurant when we were there. Â So awesome of them!!! Â Great customer service.Overall, I cannot wait to go back, it was certainly a memorable experience."
"Taking off a star because I wish our waitress explained the food or offered suggestion just a little more. Â She pushed ordering three items each as this is small plates (really medium plus) and we left almost an entire dish untouched as we were so full. Â Having said that, this place rocks!!! We had a long glorious city walk from michigan ave to get here and it was perfect. Â Our table not quite ready on time so we grabbed some wine at the bar. Â Listening to all the hipsters gabbing away is scene shot straight out of Portlandia, hysterical and awesome. Â Didn't order any goat but the kohlrabi salad divine as were the squash blossom crab ran goons and shrimp dishes. Â Get the cheese bread, yo quiero something or other...Bourdain loves this place and I just saw Chicago episode and then pal tells me we had reservations there, happy happy..."
"Despite they CRAZY crowds, this place delivers. Our party of four shared a bunch of dishes and they were all good; well prepared, well presented, good portions, creative flavors. Pricey, but I'll go back."
"Just like an episode of MasterChef, I got to see the blood and sweat for each plate. Â We came here on Vday and they sat us in the bar next to the plating station. Â This was a great opportunity for us to peek into their kitchen and communicate with the chefs throughout the night. Â Everyone was friendly, and they even comped us on plate. Â :D"
"I can truly say this is one of top ten restaurants I've been to in my lifetime. I am fortunate to have secured a reservation here on our short trip to Chicago. All the menu items were super inventive and tasty. My favorite out of the seven dishes my husband and I've tried was the pig face, and my least favorite was the goat belly; however, my husband thought the exact opposite (his favorite was the goat belly and he liked pig face the least). We do still agree that all of the dishes were scrumptious and above par. This really goes to show that Girl and the Goat has something special for every palette. The servers were extremely friendly (they even do a coat check check for you), music was hip, and the atmosphere was lively yet intimate. I highly recommend this to everyone visiting or living in Chicago!"
Food was ok. Not my style.
"Delicious and not as expensive as I expected! I'm not a big fan of meat, but I have to admit the pig face was super good -- tasted like a pattie of bacon fat and maple syrup. Our server was super friendly and comped us an extra app because we waited about 15 minutes after our reservation time to be seated. The atmosphere was trendy, but a little too loud for my liking. I couldn't hear my man talking to me from across the table!"
"Super unique food choices. Loved everything. Had about 6 different drinks and each one was outstanding. There's so many great things I could say, but I'd be writing all day. If you're going here make sure to book in advance. We did a 2 month booking before hand. Also make sure to go with a group of people. It makes it so much fun.Oysters, cauliflower, octopus, and their pig face are some of my highest recommendations. Also, be open to trying new things you wouldn't think you'd live. I'm pretty sure you'll change your mind! Enjoy :)"
"Glad I went here!Went for my birthday dinner. What a splendid way to go about the evening. My stomach was happy. But damn, the music was loud.Onwards!Definitely get the crisp braised pork shank. Has some buttermilk ressing and butternut-shiitake and naan. It all was just so delicious. The naan especially. I was just bewildered.Try the goat empanadas. Especially for those skeptical on trying goat--try these! I've had goat that has been too gamey or tasted like sweat (*cough* HB restaurant), but this was very tender!Get BREAD. Yes. The bread. I believe ours had a goat butter and some malted oil. Very delicious!What not to get: the beet salad. Avocado creme fraiche and anchovies. Eh, it was just plain. Wouldn't get this again.Finally the kholrabi salad with fennel, blueberries. Delicious!Also, get the miso-butterscotch budino - bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashews. Anything with bacon has my heart.The service was excellent. Tried the earheart cocktail. Awesome."
"I'm confused about the hype surrounding this place. Or, maybe I'm just spoiled from all the amazing restaurants in Chicago. I tried it once a few years ago and was unimpressed. When a friend came to visit recently, she had heard the hype and wanted to go. I figured it deserved a second try - just look at all those positive reviews! Regardless, second try later and I've officially decided it's not for me. There are just way too many creative, more reasonably priced options in Chicago to go here. I can't wrap my head around why people wait months to try this place and keep coming back.Most of the dishes were too salty for my taste and none blew me away with creativity. My favorite dish was probably the green beans - the fish sauce vinaigrette was a unique touch and the cashews added a nice crunch. The goose liver mousse and pig face were both good, but neither are drawing me back. I also had the soft shell crabs, which I found disappointing. You could barely taste the crab with all the sauces! The starter breads were all good... next time I'll get them across the street at Little Goat Bakery and call it a day.Cocktails were well-balanced and tasty. The beer list, however, left something to be desired.Girl and the goat is not bad by any means -- I just don't think it lives up to even an ounce of the hype it gets."
"It's simple. Girl & the Goat is mind-blowing. Perfection at it's finest, and everything a restaurant should be. There is a reason why it is still tough to get a reservation here after almost 5 years since its birth. I took the bf here last night for his 30th birthday celebration and we were instantly impressed starting with the music. It's such a cool space and they pump out ridiculous tunes, both old and new school...everything from to Ellie Goulding, to House of Pain, to Santana. Such a party. When making the reservation I was sure to tell the hostess it was for a bday celebration and everyone from our waiter to the water boy wished my love a happy birthday...it was so fun! Speaking of the staff, I have to be sure to mention the fact that they are TOP NOTCH. The most attentive service I've seen in a long time. We really felt like we were the only people in the restaurant with the way we were being taken care of. When actually, the place was a packed house for a Sunday evening. At one point, my boyfriend was so ecstatic about homemade ranch (to be discussed later) that he ended up spilling it all over his coat and floor...about 3 servers rushed up to clean it off him and even came over with a cup of club soda and a towel to spot clean his coat...like, what? The service is bananas!In a natural fashion we started out with a cocktail. Me, the Local 75, and the boy went with the old goat. Mine was deliciously refreshing and his was a classic old-fashioned. Both amazing. I will tell you what we ordered for the food, but my words can't even begin to do it justice. Please trust when I say each dish was better than the next:Honey sambal briocheCelery root and cheddar pierogi'sSautÃ©ed green beansNantucket bay scallopsWood oven roasted pig faceCrisp braised pork shankWe ordered everything at once and our waiter spaced everything to perfection and according to tastes. All of it was delectable, but the CUTAGRA was absolutely the pork shank. This my friends, was drop dead, hands down, the best dish I've ever had in all my life. The pork was crisp on the outside, tender on the inside and served with warm, house made naan, buttermilk ranch, a tangy buffalo-type sauce and butternut squash kimchee. The flavor explosion is unexplainable. It's a must have at Girl & the Goat. We didn't want to come down from our food high, so we ordered the bittersweet chocolate for dessert. It was similar to a warm brownie served with shiitake caramel gelato and toffee creme. Wow. Unreal. Also, our waiter brought my bf a piece of sticky date cake with a candle to give him a bday wish....how cute is that? Over all our experience and Girl & the Goat was exceptional. It's officially now my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. The only downfall I could see happening is that it may ruin me for all future meals to come because, well, this is the BEST THERE IS. Thank you Girl & the Goat for pure culinary bliss."
"Heard the hype and really wanted to go check it out. As a foodie. I was really looking forward to an incredible meal, great service and a nice business dinner. The food was what I expected, (except the Pig Face was gritty). The Server we had was informative and friendly but that is where it stopped. I spend a few hundred dollars there last night and during our meal we were asked no less than 40 times if we were done eating, when clearly there was food on the table.At first it was annoying, then obnoxious, then simply became overbearing, insensitive and rude. Â In the end, there is no reason to visit this restaurants again. Simply not worth the aggravation...."
1.best designed place in chicago.interior design is to die for if you are into modern and industrial design2.food is amazing.everything has unique taste 3.staff is friendly4.i know reservation is a must but if you come around 5pm they can find space for you
No explanation needed... :-)
"We sat at the bar to eat because this place is usually packed with a 3 hour wait. Â Well now we know why. Â Even though we sat at the bar, the wait staff was attentive, fast and friendly and the food was spectacular. The host seemed a little snippy but that could easily be overlooked after you try their Miso Hungry Bread as an appetizer. It was the warmest brioche and probably the best bread I've had at a restaurant. It came with this fresh blueberry jam and smooth chili butter (not spicy which I'm okay with it). Â I had the pig face with potato sticks and fried egg.. A fully realized dish. Perfectly cooked and flavored. Truffle cake was also a delight. Â I'm looking forward to our next visit."
"So far in my nearly 2 years in Chicago, this has been my best restaurant experience. Â It's a small plates restaurant, so definitely come in with the mindset to be adventurous with the foods that you try.First off, the cocktails are fantastic. Â I had the vodka & pimms drink with cucumber and it was very refreshing! Â We started off with the corn fed bread which comes with a goat cheese spread. Â It completely hit the spot to start us off. Â Every type of plate we had here was different and unique; between the stuffed lamb calamari (yum) to the beef ribs with okra over corn on the cob. Â These are all plates that you can't get anywhere else. Â While the signature dish to get is the ""roasted pig face,"" I preferred the braised pork shank. Â The meat on the pork shank basically falls off the bone it's so tender. Â That paired with the bread and sauce is my favorite dish there.Don't overlook the vegetable plates though, I know I know, broccoli and green beans are the green vegetables that you would normally avoid as a kid, but I'm telling you the broccoli with cream sauce and the green beans are unlike any other vegetables you've had before, they're seasoned perfectly. Â The service here is definitely something to take note of, they came 3 times during our meal to change out our dirty plates to clean ones. Â The service was excellent, I felt like a queen. Â We finished with the butterscotch dessert, it was pretty good but would have been better if it was served warm. Â It's a combination of textures; cake, nuts, and butterscotch pudding with a really great flavor.All in all, my favorite restaurant experience from the great service, to the variety of food, to the ambiance. Â So glad that we were able to get a reservation in, folks this place fills up fast. Â By 5:30pm on a Wednesday, people were waiting for tables. Â My expectations were high coming in but they were met and I left needing a nap from the amount of food I ate. Â All so good! Â Yum, can't wait to come back."
"I thought it was just A-OK...A couple months ago, I visited Chi-town with my boo and found G&TG on Yelp. After reading several of the glowing short stories describing their near transcendent experiences crossing into a foodie netherworld of awesomeness, how could we NOT grub there?Even though many Yelpers warned not too, my girlfriend and I didn't make reservations and took our chances by walking in during dinner time. The host told us that we could wait would be an hour to an hour and a half for a two-person table. She also suggested that we could just sit at the bar (and like most places, did not require an RSVP). Pretty easy choice.Our server suggested that we order at least a dish from each section (Veggies, Goat, Pork, etc...), and so we did. From what the server told me, the menu changes every several months, but for what it's worth, below is my overview:Roasted Cauliflower (Mint, Pine nuts, pickled peppers): This was my favorite dish of the night; however, it might have been a tad too salty for my taste. If you enjoy snacking on cauliflower, then this dish is a must.Escargot Ravioli (Tamarind-miso sauce and bacon): Solid. I appreciate how the raviolis were perfectly al dente. Unfortunately, I thought the bacon was missing from this dish (like LeBron in the 4th Quarter) and can't say if the sauce was very memorable.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (Sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, and potato stix): No thank you. I just feel that it's over cooked and salted. I can't recommend this one.Confit Goat Belly (Bourbon butter, lobster, crab, and fennel): It was decadent, dreamy, and savory. With these ingredients, it's hard to fail. Not much to complain about here. Rhubarb Shortcake (Horchata tapioca and ""Cinnamon toast crunch""): It was fine. I enjoyed the tart and sweet, but not so much the tough texture. It's definitely interesting, but I wish we ordered a different dessert.Service: Attentive, friendly, and fast - just simply outstanding!Atmosphere: Spacious, hip, and loud - it seems like a hotspot for young to mid-age professionals. Trendy decor helps set the mood.Should you try Girl & the Goat? I think so, if you're a food nerd that makes it a priority to indulge at a restaurant and don't mind paying about $. Would I return the next time I'm in Chicago. Probably not."
Amazing. Definitely eat there if you're willing to experiment with food.
"Best meal I've ever had in my life. My mother and I went to Chicago in October (yes I still remember everything we ate!!) for a wedding and as soon as we booked the flight, we also booked our reservation here (about two months in advance). I will note that if you can't get a reservation, wait until a couple days before and they will let go of any unconfirmed reservations. Cutthroat, I know, but I love it.The three of us enjoyed:Kohlrabi salad: PerfectionGrilled baby octopus: Tender and deliciousPig face: I couldn't believe I was eating it, but it was amazingSugo: I don't normally eat wheat, but I did have a bite (or two) of this and let me tell you, I did not regret it.Trout: My personal favorite. The flavors were out of this world good. I still remember it very fondly many months later.I can NOT stress to you enough when I say you HAVE to try this place. When I make it back out to Chicago, I know where my first culinary stop is going to be."
"Impossible to get reservations even 3 weeks ahead so we decided to walk-in after our flight around 5:30pm. The place was PACKED. We were lucky enough to get a small space on the couch/lounge area. Restaurant was dark and loud from where we were sitting. We had stuffed ourselves silly with all my snacks on the plane so I had to choose very carefully what dishes we were gonna try. My biggest regret was not being able to try their goat leg (6-10 lbs!). ~Pig Face: Tender juicy pork scrambled with fried shoestrings. There were around three different sauces on the plate and we just mixed everything up for a party in our mouth. I enjoyed the salty and tangy flavors, no need for condiments! ~Shisito peppers: Great grilled miso flavor with parmesan. Way too much for two people. ~Goat Liver Mousse: Served with crumpets (airy but heavy), apple butter, and pickled mushrooms. I love pate and was curious to what goat liver would taste like. This mousse was light with subtle goat flavor. The accoutrements of apple butter and pickled mushrooms really added to the goat liver. Didn't try nearly as much as I wanted but the goat leg is a must next time!"
"I'll start by saying the Pig Face is lame. Looks pretty-but not worth trying. However, the Halibut and the Octopus were amazing. Worth coming here for those two alone. The waitstaff are awesome and we were seated right at our reservation time."
"I was surprised by my experience here. After hearing mountains of good news about this place, I was expecting nothing less. While I admit the food was pretty darn good, it wasn't as extraordinary as I thought it would be. My only explanation for this might be that we had one of the last seatings of the night (10:30 PM reservation). I'm not sure if that had anything to do with the fact that the food wasn't STAND OUT amazing, just pretty darn good. We had the cauliflower, roasted beets, loup de mer, bass, and goat carpaccio. I noticed that both vegetable dishes had a a lot of bean sprouts as a garnish...it seemed a little ingredient redundant to me. While the fish and goat were cooked well and very good, I didn't quite walk away feeling that I'd had a 7 star meal. That being said, the service and ambiance were both excellent! I this place deserves another visit at a normal dining hour."
"This place is so hyped... so we decided to go to dinner and try it out. I will say it is a must for foodies. We had cauliflower, green beans with cashews and other stuff that I can't remember because the drinks I had were fabulous and were made really well. The staff and service was excellent and everyone was very nice. I am huge on customer service and can say that they know how to treat their patrons. It was a girls night and we left completely satisfied. I gave it 3 stars because I am not sure if I would wait for 2 months for a reservation again."
"I snagged a Friday 8:30 PM reservation here as a Christmas present to my girlfriend who has been raving about this place since we met. For those of you trying to get a sense of how long it will take to get a reservation, I was able to get this one ~2.5 weeks in advance. A prime time (like 6:00) is harder to come by, even on a weekday evening. My friend has also walked in and (after waiting ~two hours) was able to get a spot at the bar. So, miracles do happen, if you're willing to drink at a nearby establishment while waiting. We weren't seated right away, which was a little annoying because we had the reservation. But I get that this is a really popular destination and you can't regulate how long people with previous reservations will take at the table. We took our sweet time enjoying our dinner here as a result; we didn't feel rushed at all. We had already decided on our food in the week leading up to our reservation, so we ordered immediately. Our waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person to share (tapas style). Unless you want lots of leftovers, I discourage you from ordering any more than two per person. We were already almost completely stuffed by the time our third course arrived. Needless to say, we got two almost untouched dishes to go. My least favorite dish was the green beans. They didn't taste like anything special and certainly were not worth the ~$10 spent on them. They definitely weren't bad--just your typical green beans with some salty sauce and cashews. With more cashews, I might have been more impressed. The baby octopus was okay (a compliment from a seafood-hater), but the dish really should have had a higher octopus to veggies ratio. The dish was more veggie than octo and the octo was super rubbery. The stand-out dishes for me were the roasted cauliflower, the oven-roasted pig face, and the ham frites. Yum.We were totally stuffed by dessert, but couldn't leave without the miso-butterscotch budino. I'm typically not big on pudding-like consistency, but this truly was an all-star dessert."
"Great place, great service...it's worth the wait."
"What can I say that hasn't already been said here. This place is a need to go place in Chicago. I'm glad I talked to a girlfriend of mine who has been here because I tried to book a month in advance on their online system (for a sunday) and it was booked, so I called and luckily they had a place open for me. So, plan accordingly. This place is very popular with tourist and locals. Overall my experience was great, the food was to die for, and the service was pretty on point. Our waiter was very good about making suggestions and letting us know what food options we had and how many dishes would be good for a party of two. This place is like most hip new chicago restaurants as it's tapas style, so you share plates. Since it was only my boyfriend and I, we ordered the forest gump (yummy bread with different spreads, I think one was a pea and garlic puree and the other was a butter with carrots, whatever it was the bread was amazing), wood fired scalops, roasted cauliflower ( I would eat this over and over), and their famous pig face. It was a meal that was unforegetful. All the taste came together perfectly in all the dishes. Â I still can't believe I ate pig face, It kind of tasted like a fattier version of pork belly. For dessert, we had this parfait type thing with butterscotch and cashews with bacon toffee. Whatever it was, it was amazing. My boyfriend and I were fighting over it. Overall, the meal was amazing and I would come back. Food is also very afordable, you're looking at 8-20 dollars for most dishes. Â This place definitely lived up to all its hype."
"My friend made a reservation here about a month in advance for 7 people to have dinner on a Thursday night in September. The wait was absolutely worth it!! Love the family style eating concept -- all dishes are made to share. They recommend ordering about 2 dishes per a person. We ended up ordering probably 3 per a person and went absolutely ham (pun intended) eating everything. Here are some of the table's favorite dishes:1) The Pig Face -- the absolute winner...tastes better than bacon, if you can believe it!2) The Chickpea Fritters -- you'd never expect something like this to be amazing, but it really left a presence on me -- so soft and tender.3) The grilled octopus -- the sauces and the vegetables mixed with octopus were delicious4) The steak ribs -- juicy, tender, and the corn is a plus5) The Halibut -- the balsamic vinaigrette on the bottom of the dish really made this so flavorful!The ambiance is great too. Check out the creepy goth goat painting on the side lol -- It can get pretty loud, but who cares? The food is what you're there for anyways!"
One word. Awesome. Worth it. Make reservations early on. It's very crowded. Everything here is delicious. Get the local 75 if you like vodka and sour taste. Pig face was to fatty for my palette but flavorful. Have to try a goat dish when you're here!
Everything they say it is!Definitely get the pig face. Some of the V (for vegetable) portions are huge - so estimate that and something else per person if you're getting them.Table space is obviously very challenging to get but bar space is easy come easy go.
3 stars for the food. Â 5 stars for the service.
"I really enjoyed the food here, and found it to be creative in a really down-home style, if that makes any sense at all.I had the goat liver mousse, and was in heaven for the entire meal. It came in a little glass jar, and half dozen freshly made biscuits with some jam. Perfection.The atmosphere and service were phenomenal. The decor was relaxed, but had a fantastic industrial vibe to it. That, juxtaposed with our rather rustic large table made for an interesting meal experience. Also brilliant management technique. I love the very LEYE idea of having servers just put orders in, and food runners bringing individual foods out as they finish. It encouraged sharing among the members of our table, and led to an alltogether more family style experience."
"From my understanding this place is under new management. And new owners since the previous reviews. My co workers and I come here a few Friday's a month for breakfast. We have never had a bad experience. The waitresses are always polite and accurate Â the owners (husband & wife) are very welcoming and come to check on us personally. I'am addicted to their pancakes. Breakfast special is very affordable for a lot of food $4.99 2 pancakes or French toast 2 meat 2 eggs and 99cent for hash brown M-F. If you like Golden nugget up the street you'll like them. It's the same exact food to me breakfast wise. 5 stars for me great food, service, and clean. What more can you ask for? Breakfast at tiffanys?"
"Probably one of the best meals I've ever had.Get the pig face. The halibut is also amazing...and the manila clams with goat liver pate ngggggggh... Oh forget it, get everything on the menu. You can't lose.P.S. always get dessert."
"Creative food, tasty cocktails, nice atmosphere, & fair prices.What we will always remember is the extraordinary service and attention to detail by the restaurant's staff. Every course was timed perfectly, drinks retrieved immediately. There were even some special surprises for our anniversary.Plenty of restaurants in Chicago have good food. Rarely do they have such good food paired with such attentive service.Can't wait to go back! We made our reservations 2 months in advance and the pickings were slim."
"I randomly picked this place based on yelp reviews and walked across town to try it out. It was exactly what I was looking for with a good ambience, great service and phenomenal food.For anyone who likes lamb or goat I would highly recommend the goat loin skewer. Mine was cooked perfectly and set in a medley of flavors that puts the dish as one of my all time favorites."
You are my fav go-to foodie restaurant. Thanks for having a way to sneak people in w/ no reservations at the bar or on the couches. The servers are kind and unpretentious. A lively people watching seen 'cause everyone is having such a good time! I also like that there's always something new to try. ~nancy
"Crap. I don't even know where to start. Okay. Never mind. I know where to start. I have always found people in Chicago to be super-friendly and warm. I hail from the land of polite, which is better than the alternative, but I really dig the genuine feel of Chicago.The Girl & the Goat wraps up all the feels--and puts them on plates for you. Seats at the bar are first come-first serve so you never have to worry about reservations if you don't mind the bar. AND, if your iPhone 5s is dying, they'll let you use their charging station at the host station (!) And that's just the beginning of the great service.I started with the grilled octopus, expertly sautÃ©ed with green beans, radishes, pistachios and a light but umami-ish sauce that made me happily kick my legs sitting on the barstool like a kid at the ice cream parlor. They even omitted the pork for me. The bites were cut small which made me wish I carried chopsticks around with me. (It wouldn't be the weirdest thing I carry around in my purse.)My main dish was the grilled duck with kimchee. Unfortunately, the duck was overcooked (medium vs medium-rare) and the flavors unfortunately did not marry well together. But, unless it's inedible, I'm not sending food back so I decided to stick it out. BUT THEN, [Justin] leaned across the bar to me and said that the Duck Tongue was on its way. (When reviewing the menu, I had mentioned to him how much I loved duck tongue but had decided on the kimchee duck.) I was confused and he said that he could tell I didn't like the dish. WHOA. THAT is service, folks. Really. I don't think I've ever had that kind of service. 10 seconds later, the crispy duck tongue arrives and the other dish is swept away. The duck tongue was surprisingly amazing. The small tongues were deep-fried but still soft and chewy. The beans in the dish made me pause but wow, did it work flavor-wise. In between chuckles, I happily gobbled it down. On my second beer, I looked at the clock and noticed that I was running a little behind to see the Eddie Izzard show, so I missed out on the dessert that was graciously offered to me boo! It had bacon in it, which I don't eat, but the dessert did have the magical words 'bread pudding.' I bet it's flocking amazing. Someone try it for me and let me know how it is! G&G, you're officially my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Me love you long time."
"This restaurant simply rocks. The service is excellent and the fare us unique. Both times I've visited the experience was great and I definitely did not leave hungry. Though I normally shy away from a soft boiled egg yolk on anything, it really completes the flavor of the Goat Face."
"I come in here for the ChicPea fritters regularly. Great taste, very different. Refreshing!! I love food and this place delivers. Very quality here."
"The food was inventive. Some of the dishes were a little salty (hot kitchen, perhaps), some worked nicely, some didn't work too well. Will get into each dish soon. Enjoy the pictures, meanwhile."
"Visited Chicago for the first time from Miami and was told plenty of times to visit Girl and a goat! I was excited to score some reservations even if it was a Monday night! We arrived and immediately loved the vibe of the place. We got there a little early so we took a seat in their ""sitting"" area that felt more like comfy loungy sofas where you can order drinks and food while you wait.They sat us and we began to ORDER! Goat empanadas- I have never had goat, but I couldn't go to this place without having some. They were yummy! They had a Mexican twist to them with queso fresco and corn arepa. The goat meat was shredded and full of flavor. Ok. I like goat. LolOctopus- my favorite dish of the night. I always order octopus if it's on a menu. So I am familiar with different tastes and textures. This octopus has got to be on my top 3. It was chopped up and sautÃ©ed with veggies and pistachios in a perfectly seasoned lemon sauce. It was perfection honestly. Escargot Ravioli- was intrigued and excited to order this dish. It's original and never been done. We all know how to eat the garlic drenched escargot we have come to love but have you ever had it like this? Probably not...but you should! It was exactly what I envisioned...but I would call them dumplings rather than ravioli. The escargot were tender not chewy and had that earthy taste you either love or hate about them. I happen to love it. The miso based sauce was a perfect accompaniment! Sagu- I appreciated this dish though it was not my favorite! I actually loved the pappardelle cut and the fact that you can taste its ""homemade"" pasta feel. It came with a mixture of goat and beef in a red sauce....that's all.Pig face- I'm not a HUGE fan of pig. But I knew this was one of their signature dishes. Plus it came with a fried egg ;) I understood why it was one of their signature dishes as soon as I tasted it. The pork face was tender and not too pungent. It was cooked perfectly! The egg made my heart happy and so did this sweet sauce it came with! So thank you Girl and a Goat for living up to the hype."
"Great service and food for the most part. Â The Multigrain bread was fantastic - warm and crusty. Â The octopus would have been great as well except it was seriously oversalted. Â Shishito peppers were on the heavier side. Â The fried oysters were delicious and we'll balanced.Overall a great dining experience with the hubs in Chicago. Â However, it is way too loud to have a conversation if you are planning to take a date here. Â And make reservations cause this place gets crazy packed!"
"If I was Greek and was a worshipper of Dionysus then The Girl and the Goat staff would be the gate keepers. Had the chefs tasting and was utterly blown away, every dish was perfectly cooked, the big take aways were the roasted pig face, squash blossoms, green beans, duck tongue, pork shank, pretty much everything was amazing. My only critique? I wish I had more space in my stomach to keep eating."
"5/5 food5/5 service I'd give higher if I could honestly5/5 atmosphere (chill easy vibe)Well,I can say my wife out did her self for my b day dinner.This was single handily the best restaurant dinner I've ever had in my life.We had quite a lot for just two of us...Kolrabi salad 10/10 really surprised didn't think I'd like itGreen garlic porgies 15 out of 10 amazing dish... Really the absolute best... Every flavor was there all textures... Simply THE best I've ever experienced in my life.Brioche bread 10/10 home run in my book so fresh so goodShishito peppers 8/10 very good but salty for my palletSeared scallop - 9/10 good my wife is raving about it. For me it was good but not quite my pallet.Goat belly - 8/10 good dishPork shank - 9/10 really really good but was a little too full by this point. The only thing I felt was the buffalo sauce was a little too salty for me again.Budino - 10/10 simply amazing dish the salty from the bacon, the sweet form and tart form everything else... Just amazing...So that's 5 stars right there but there's more...He food was all piping hot, right out of the kitchen...HUNTER our waiter was simply amazing spot on and all his support staff runners ect where lightning quick.Honestly, makes me want to move from the bay and realize how bad I've had it over there considering this....."
"This place is just phenomenalWe tried the Goat heart and Pig Face, both of which I thought I would never eat. They were so good, that I would consider coming back to Chicago to have them again. Their salads are good and the service is great!Highly recommended place, and a perfect date spot."
"Food was good, but did not live up to the hype. Service was a bit lackluster too. My advice is to save your time and money and go to purple pig instead.I had the pig face, roasted beets, and halibut. Small portions and frankly, not memorable."
"I had previously given Girl and the Goat 5 stars based off of 3 separate experiences, however, I went tonight for my anniversary and it was tainted. We made reservations back in October, a you have to do to get in. When we arrived, we were seated at a table literally on top of 2 other tables. In order to get into our seats, the other tables had to be moved. I understand that this is a restaurant in high demand, however, when you are paying 50$ a person and expecting great service and ambiance, being literally on top of the people next to you runs it. The waitress did not even have room to go around my boyfriend to put he dishes down, so he had to move over when food arrived. We were also rushed to order and our food came out quickly, again, I am sure because they had more tables reserved after we left. I am sad, as Girl and the Goat was my favorite restaurant in Chicago but I do not think I will be returning. See my previous review for food critiques if you do decide to go."
"I'm just at a lost for words. I've always been a picky eater and had always been looking for a place with exploding flavours in their food. What can I say? Girl & the Goat seemed to go beyond my standards. Though the ingredients may sound like they won't work together, the blend of tastes creates such intense flavour that I fell in love at first bite. Man I sound like the rat from ratatouille, except I don't have his culinary talents. Note though that I would highly recommend reserving a table. It's a highly popular restaurant and although it's quite a bit away from the city, it always seem to be packed. So definitely reserve and don't be surprised if you'll have to reserve 3 months or so in advance. It's THAT popular and for a good reason. It's a family sharing kind of dining so all of the dishes are shared amongst yourselves. here are the dishes we've ordered: [Wood-oven Roasted Pig Face] Â [Crispy Beef Short Ribs] Â [Chickpea Fritter] Â [ Escargot Ravioli] & [Duck Tongues] The best was definitely the [Duck Tongues] and [Wood-oven Roasted Pig Face]. Do keep in mind that some of these items are seasonal! For example, the [Crispy Beef Short Ribs] is definitely a winter only dish. Some of these dishes may sound a little scary, I mean duck tongues and pig face? But fear not! Although they may sound a little gnarly, we weren't actually served an entire pig face nor were we served with scary looking duck tongues! All of the dishes looked absolutely amazing and no where near scary. Once I took a bite, I forgot all about what I was eating but was just enjoying the deliciousness and the combinations of all the flavours. I literally can't recommend this place enough. It's absolutely amazing with absolutely delicious dishes! Definitely give it a try no matter how far away and out of the way it is! Totally worth it, and to ensure a seat, make a reservation. Highly highly highly recommended."
"Pork face?! Know about duck face but wtf is pork face, g&g?It's disappointment. Blandly under-seasoned, so don't expect porky pig on your plate, apple-in-mouth. Instead expect a mash of pork hidden under an egg. The egg actually has more flavor.. how does pork have no flavor!And the plate's miniscule. Confusing because you get a full bag of slathered and slimy green beans for 1/2 the price. For that same price you also get a full head of broccoli with indistinguishable blue cheese.. ""could do at home."" So a ""main"" plate signature dish is a bland, dull-plated pig hash that's smaller than each of the appetizer vegetables at 2x price.Throw in used-car salesman service that SUGGESTED we order 3-4 plates plus dessert; we didn't see her again until the check. Throw in the difficulty of getting an opentable res (check 4:30 1mo ahead) and the crowds that fill it, all standing and milling about or posing for touristy-selfies with that dumb corner picture. Throw in the drafty window seats.What you're left with is worse than duck face. Throw out your res and skip it."
"It was a great atmosphere and the food was all really good. Â The portions are pretty small so you'll want to get a few things. Â I don't quite think it's worth having to make a reservation in excess of a month in advance or waiting 2 hours for the night of, but definitely a place you should try. Â We spent about $150 for the two of us, but had a few drinks as well (which were actually very good).The service was great, but the only thing I didn't like was how close the tables were. Â I went with one person and we sat next to another table of two and it felt like we were all basically in on each other's conversations - good for meeting people, not good for personal conversation. Â Overall, somewhere I would go again."
"Creative, well-executed dishes, shared plates. Â Palate fatigue sets in early here as man offerings are on the very heavy side. Â So busy, hope to return when it is no longer the 'new/hot/hip spot'. Â Loved the decor and layout, especially the epically long bar."
Early dinner (really late lunch) at the bar with incredible service from Justin. Â Favorite dishes were the steak tartar and clams on toast with duck mouse.... just incredible. Only problem is I can no longer have tartar anyplace else. Â Halibut and empanadas were also excellent. Cream/carmel/cake/crusted cashews for desert..... almost licked the plate but didn't want to risk being ask not to return.
"Everything you hear about this amazing spot is true! It's perfectly prepared, simple ingredients served with incredible attention from chef to table. If you are from Chicago, you must:1.) Read The Devil in the White City at least once2.) Always call the Sears Tower the Sears Tower.... there is no Willis3.) EAT AT Girl & the Goat!!"
Place was impossible to get reservations The food what can I say we ordered the entire menu and one thing was better then the other My only complaint was the waitress she was rude. Would only allow us to order one drink at a time we wanted two cause they took so long. And we would ask for there specialty drinks and we wanted a different vodka then the one they suggested and she wouldn't allow it
"I don't know how my favorite restaurant in Chicago has now simply pissed me off three times in a row. I am going to focus Ong last experience because it was the one that just put me over the edge. We went without a reservation, as usual for us, and got seats at the bar in good time. However I wish we would have waited for a table because our bartender pissed me off! Stephanie Izard you are a great chef but you MUST do something about the assholes working for you. The service is the MAIN reason why I can no longer give Girl & the Goat 5 stars. Last night the bar tender ignored me waving my arm in the air to try to get ANY MENUS because we had been sitting there for some time with zero attention. When I finally got a wine list I asked to taste the Tempranillo he stated ""tell me what kind of wines you like. I can pick a glass good for you."" I told him I like most Tempranillos but I wanted to try theirs before I ordered a full glass. He looked like I just asked him to go kill a cow and cook it for me before he reluctantly walked to the other side of the bar to get me a taste. Â Really prick??? When we finally got his attention to order some food got my favorites: the fritters and cauliflower. My friend ordered the pig face to start and said he needed more time to decide about the rest. Our bartender stated ""I wouldn't recommend that dish last as it is an overpowering one."" My friend boldly said he understood but wanted to start with it anyway. At that the little prick proceeded to say, with a snotty attitude, that he would NOT RECOMMEND basically the entire fish section. WHAT???? The shocked look on both of our faces didn't even faze the bartender. His attitude and dirty looks proceeded throughout the meal. Sadly the female bartender at the opposite end of the bar was able to help us out with water refills and fresh drinks because The Prick was incapable. Luckily my friend and I enjoyed the food enough not to walk out halfway through our meal. Izard... do something!!! I want to like this place again."
"I had been looking forward to eating at Girl and the Goat since I booked my tickets to Chicago several months ago, and I can honestly say that it was worth the wait. Hands down one of the best places I've eaten at EVER! The service was great, we had a very enthusiastic and friendly waiter that was engaging and entertaining. The restaurant itself was spacious and well decorated, a mix between rustic and modern. (The only downside to the decoration in my opinion was the huge well-lit painting that hung on the wall across from me. It was very Tim Burton-esque and a little bit creepy...). As for the food, wow! Every dish was great and none of them disappointed:Bread: They change their bread menu very frequently, so I won't rave about the Gouda&Bacon or the Maize&Blue, but definitely get their bread! It's fresh and fluffy and delicious.Chickpea Fritters: One of my favorites of the night! Crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside with shallots to round out the taste. Goat Empanada: The meat was so tender and the dish itself was very savory. A little on the heavy side though.Shishito peppers: A great dish to get if you like spicy food and have a large group to share with. It's a very densely packed dish and filled all of us up pretty quickly. Not to mention, the Parmesan crumbles on every pepper were to die for.Lamb stuffed calamari: WOW! The most tender squid I've ever eaten, and I usually don't like lamb because of the acidic taste to it, but this dish blended the lamb aftertaste really well with the sauce.Duck tongue: You must get this!! This was my favorite dish of the night; the tongues are crispy and contrasted with little chunks of tuna, mixed with a miso based sauce and peppers that make it sweet, spicy, savory, and just amazing.Scallops: These are made in a creamy uni sauce with special bacon bits on top. Another fantastic dish for those wanting something on the lighter side and enjoy scallops (which they sear to perfection).Pig face: Everyone raves about this and rightly so. Enough said.Desserts:Sticky date cake: really good but very sweet and heavy. Two bites are enough to be satisfied because of the rich taste.Rhubarb shortcake: Fresh rhubarb..what?! Definitely more on the citrus side and not as sweet. This wasn't my favorite, but still pretty good.Miso toffee bacon budino: THE BEST THING IVE EATEN ALL YEAR. It's creamy and sweet with a hint of salt and has the most amazing texture and flavor that just sits on your palette for awhile."
Omg!!!! This place is worth the wait!! Everything is amazing!! I went with a group of 6 people and we managed to destroy the menu!! The wait for the food was not that long and as soon as we started trying things we all fell in love!! Definitely a go to spot!
Came here to grab a drink after dinner and was able to score a couple of seats at the bar on a Friday night. They had a nice drink menu and great ambiance. The food smelled delicious as well.
"First things first, I can totally understand why you have to make reservations months in advance for this place. Â AH-freaking-MAZING.Let's avoid the fluff and dive straight into the food!Pan Seared Halibut. Â Cooked with almond butter, white asparagus, and blueberry nuoc cham. Â How creative! Â Nuoc cham is a Vietnamese dipping sauce and S.I. put a spin on it by adding blueberries. Â Mind blown! Â It didn't really taste like authentic nuoc cham, Â which is good because I know a lot of westerners who are not big fans of fish sauce. Â The sauce was tart with hints of sweetness from the brown sugar and occasional burst of sweetness from the blueberries. Â The sauce married perfectly with the slightly salty pan seared to perfection halibut. I was stoked to order the pigs face. Â All the reviews raved about this pigs face. Â I thought Â the flavors were amazing but it was personally too fatty. Â First, pop that little thought bubble of a pig's head on your dinner table. Â The pig's face was a circular disk with a diameter of approximately 3 inches. Â Now imagine 1/2 an inch running down the center, that was the portion with meat, everything else was fat. Â  It was served with a sunny side egg, sauce?, and small crunchy potato sticks. Â My adorable boyfriend, who is not an adventurous foodie, reluctantly tried it and said ""it's like a deconstructed breakfast."" Â So cute, he's trying.Cauliflower, I seriously hate cauliflower, with a passion. Â When I asked for a recommendation that was the first ting the server gave me. Â Really? Â The one thing I detest with my life! Â Because I asked I felt that I was obligated to order. Â  As a result, I am an born again cauliflower fan. Â It's roasted with pickled peppers, pint nuts and mint. Â The cauliflower had the perfect amount of char and saltiness. Â It had hints of spiciness from the pepper which was neutralized with the hints of mint. Â Sooo Yum.Kalbi veal chops with strawberry tapenade. Â This is a Korean influenced dish that I could have done without. Â This says a lot because I absolutely love Korean BBQ. Â I thought the sweetness from the kalbi marinade combined with the sweetness of the tapenade was a bit much. Â And the meat was over cooked for my liking.We also tried the Gouda Bacon Bread which I thought was just bread with some bacon in it. Â C'mon you can't really go wrong with bacon.We had a wonderful dining experience. Â Loved the decor and ambiance. Â The service was top notch. Â These people are on top of it. Â  During my meal, I often saw a guy walking around with an iPad overseeing the the progress of each table's meal. Â Can't wait to go back."
"Such a great night out!! Girl & the Goat was worth the wait! We ate very well last nigh, and will never forget this delicious meal. So happy we live in Chicago, and can get here again. Hopefully!! If we can get a reservation. Ha!"
"Not only one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, one of my favorite restaurants in the world! This place is incredible and every dish is better than the last. Piece of advice, make a reservation as far in advance as possible. We are here two years ago and thought it was crazy that we made a reservation a month in advance for 10:00pm, Â but again this time made it a month in advance and it was for 10:30. This place certainly lives up to its great reputation, and that is proven by how in demand its reservations remain. The food is different, creative and absolutely delicious! I won't bother recommending too many dishes since everything is so great, but will say my absolute favorite was the goat empanadas. They were fantastic. We also loved the goat carpaccio. Just go! You will love it."
"This is an incredible restaurant that we patronized very often: the creativity of the food, the uniqueness of the ingredients and flavors, the wine selection, the gorgeous decor....I can't stop raving about this place! The wood oven pork face tasted great like everything we tried there. The Squash Blossom Rangoon is light and flavorful.The desserts have the right amount of sweetness and explosive combination of flavors. The breads are inventive and so good.Our favorite place to be seated are the booths. We also tried the bar and the other tables.The service is excellent. The restrooms are clean.It is one of the best restaurants I experienced worldwide.The point of improvement was their green beans sautÃ©ed in fish soy with sliced almonds on top. The portion was small and over-priced."
"It was my boyfriend and my first visit to Chicago and we wanted to go to Chicago's best and after much research we decided Girl & the Goat was it! And they did not disappoint!!Interior:I loved the atmosphere. It was a nice, dim restaurant that was classy but not over the top. Â Service:The service was wonderful; our waitress was very welcoming and provided several options of dishes based off what we liked. She was honest when she explained that the food weren't very large dishes and she guided us on what might be a more filling dinner. She was kind and showed genuine interest in how our trip was so far. Food: The food was exceptional. The menu is creative and unique which is why this restaurant has an amazing reputation. For our appetizer, we decided on the Escargot ravioli with bacon and the Goat Empanadas. They were delicious! The tamarind-miso sauce complimented the dish and honestly we wanted a second round of empanadas haha. I would say the best dish had the wood oven roasted pig face. The dish is simple in presentation and not very large so it was quickly devoured. I will definitely be returning when I visit Chicago"
Sat at the bar for one of the most awesome meals. Â Our bartender/server was great and made the evening fun. Â Ordered 5+ dishes and did not have a single bad bite. Â The goat carpaccio was deliciously memorable and the drinks were fantastic.
"Made reservations back in March for a party of 7, and I have been eagerly anticipating this restaurant. My review is focusing on service, which is why I am only giving this place 3 stars. We were a group of 7, (3 couples and 1 extra person) and we all have different dietary restrictions. 3 are non seafood eaters, Â 2 were pescatarians, Â and the other 2 just don't eat beef Â or pork. Â There weren't a lot of plates that wouldn't accommodate all so the shared plates concept had to be split for us in 3 groups, so 3-2-2. Â we figure we would just split the tabs that way too. We asked if that was okay and we were discouraged from doing it. The reason we got was because of timing of the plates, but that didn't really matter to us, so we were like...okay.... Â  (personally i think i twas more the POS system, but if she had told us that rather than timing that would have been fine..)We ended up doing it that way anyways with a plan that we would figure the check out ourselves, then we could tell her what was going on what card. Ordering was an issue. Â To start, we wanted to order 3 orders of the honey brioche, and 2 of the frites bc those we could share it among everyone. Our waitress discouraged us from ordering that much, so we went with 2 orders of the brioche, and then 1 of fries. After we got the bread and frites, Â we were left with uneven numbers, so we did go ahead and order another order of bread, Â and another order of fries. So it was pointless for her to discourage it. When we ordered our mains, we also had some issues. After the group of 3 and 2 ordered, Â that left the last group of 2. Â Everything they would ask for she would discourage because someone else at the table already ordered it.This left them for limited options so they had to go with something they didn't want to get enough food for the two of them. When the plates came, they were pretty small, so not really shareable among 4 people, Â so discouraging that they order two of them was incredibly pointless. Â Unfortunately the service really killed the night for us. The food was actually really good. I was in the group of 3 of meat eaters , and we got the shishito peppers, beef tongue, pork belly, and pork shank. Â The Old Goat cocktail was SO good! The honey brioche was delicious and their fries were super crispy. It was all really really good. I just wish our server let us order what we wanted rather than having a disagreement with everything."
"Second time here.I had to make reservations a month in advanced for two, and could only get a 5:30 PM reservation on a Monday night. Â The hosts seemed generally uninterested when we arrived, but we were seated immediately and what made up for it was the seat. Â We got to sit right in front of the line chefs. Â The line chef directly in front of us introduced himself (Sebastian) and chatted with us the entire time (in between cooking); it really made the experience more fun. Â Food was straightforward, really flavorful and fresh. Â It was fun seeing it get made. Â Loved the shiso peppers and broccoli. Â We were able to get half orders for the sides, which were great because we could try more things. Â Also ordered green beans, bread that goes along with the pate, scallops, and pig face. Â We were stuffed by the time the pig face came out. Â Great food, good service, and good atmosphere. Â With two drinks, the whole thing was about $90, not including tip."
"This place is like an american tapas restaurant to me. The dishes were small portion, so we follow the server's advice to order a little bit of many things. We ordered sourdough bread, oysters, baby grilled octopus, pig face, and one more but forgot the name of it. I guess that dish was the least impressive one. Every menu I've tried was so-so. Â Pig face could have been better if it weren't too greasy. Â I wanted to wash my palate off with the cocktail that I ordered, but that made it worse. The grilled baby octopus was too burnt. We both couldn't eat more than a bite. The server noticed that we weren't happy with that dish right away and tried to fix it for us, but we didn't want to order anymore.I am giving 2 stars, because of their top notch service! I never had to ask my water glass to be filled, the server was very knowledgeble about their menu and so on. Also, they deducted the burnt octopus off of the check even without us asking for it. However, overall it was a very dissapointing visit for me. I was very excited to try this place, but would not go back again."
"I have been to Girl and the Goat twice now and each time is more fabulous than the next. We were seated right on time, I mean not even one minute past our reservation time. Service is really good, they are not too overbearing or pushy, and the support staff is there is so on top of clearing every single dirty plate from in front of you. The food is more than superb too. We had goat empanadas, scallops, halibut, cauliflower and the bacon pineapple dessert. Although small portions, every dish was very flavorful. There were 2 of us and we both left pretty satisfied. My cocktail was a little on the small side but none the less it was pretty tasty.Thanks Girl and the Goat for providing us with a great evening. I can't wait to see you again very soon."
"I have been reading about Girl and the Goat for years, so as soon as my trip to Chicago was planned Lindsay K. and I made reservations well ahead of time to dine here. Our reservation was at 7PM on a Wednesday night. When we arrived, the dining area and the bar were both packed. As soon as we sat down, we noticed the fun music in the background. Wait for it...R. Kelly ""Ignition Remix!"" Needless to say, the atmosphere was absolutely perfect for us! We also heard Snoop Dogg and the song ""Freshman"" by the Verve. Couldn't have asked for a better random selection of tunes! Our server gave us a good run down of the menu and answered any questions that we had. We never had to look around to find him or get his attention when we needed something. The food came out in a timely manner and we didn't end up with all of the plates at the same time which is a big pet peeve of mine. Here's what we ordered as described on the menu:Pan fried shishito peppers - favorite dish of the night AND of my trip to Chicago! This is a must try. Wood over roasted pig face - very tasty and topped with a perfectly cooked fried egg.Goat liver mousse - very rich, but delicious dish. It came with apple butter, pickled mushrooms, and crumpets. This is a large portion and was almost too much for two people. FYI - My dining partner likes liver, but did not enjoy the goat liver. Goat empanadas - this was good, but I wouldn't order it again because there are so many other things on the menu that I would love to try.Miso-butterscotch budino - I'm not a dessert person but this was one of the best desserts I've ever had. It had bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashews. Everything worked so well together! Both the food and the service were 5 stars. I had a wonderful experience!"
"This is by far my most favorite restaurant in Chicago. Incredible food, great service, good ambience and excellent process flow.The dishes that I've had that were OUT OF THIS WORLD were:- Their BREADS! (Recently had the warm challah bread - omg...) - Wood grilled broccoli- Beef short rib with corn (that was back in September)- Wood oven roasted pig face (sunny side up egg, crispy pork and potato hash, mix it up, and you get the most heavenly combination!)- Miso-butterscotch budinoEverything else is very good - can't go wrong with any order. I'm going to make monthly reservations so that I can keep coming back."
"Loved this place. Great for vegetarians too! Everyone keeps raving about the chickpea fritters but I didn't like them as much. Maybe my expectations were set too high? I had the beet salad, cauliflower and homemade bread - everything was on point! The service was good. It is a little loud in the restaurant but that's because it's packed full of happy people."
"If all my reviews have high marks, does that take away my credibility? Â I'd like to think I am compelled to take the time to sit down when I am moved by an experience. However, I must admit I cheated. I read tons of reviews and had the meal picked out before sitting down. Â  I don't have much time to dine out, so I try to maximize my enjoyment by doing my homework. I started with the famous cocktail ""lux goods"", which reminded me of a cold chai tea, and was most certainly a fabulous starter. All the tapas choices were excellent, so I list them starting with my favorite:Pan fried shishito pepper (and I usually don't like peppers)Wood oven roasted pig face (and I used to be a vegetarian)Honey sambai brioche (the best way to splurge on a carb)Goat empanadas (so much better than the Filipino grocery store)Chick pea fritter (I don't remember seeing a chickpea, but I trust it was in there)Crispy beef short ribs (a favorite by the birthday girl that was in the party)Miso-butterscotch budino dessert (light and fluffy)Sticky date cake (moist and heavier texture)And our supermodel server was sweet to bring us a little sweet scoop topped with a birthday candle. The place receives the 3 Grrrrrr's. Great service, great vibe, great food/drinks. Think ahead, make a reservation for a month or two from now and you'll have no regrets."
Delicious but incredibly small portions. I would go back if it weren't so expensive for so little.
"I took my mother to Girl & the Goat for an early Mother's Day meal. I was lucky to get a last minute reservation at 5:45, and I was pleased that we were sat immediately. I don't understand the rave about the ambiance of this place, the tables are longer than they are wide to accommodate the many plates, but due to the proximity of your neighbors and the music, it's very difficult to have a conversation here which takes away from a small plates experience.Food wise, I was totally underwhelmed. Here is what we ordered:Taco Bread - an average sized bun cut into 5 pieces with a pico de gallo and cream cheese type of side. The bread's texture was soft and had zest to it, but it was unmemorable.Cauliflower - my favorite dish of the night. Quite a generous serving of cauliflower too, and made just right.Broccoli - not sure what happened here, but our broccoli was charred. We asked if this was normal and our waitress said some people like the fact that half of the pieces were burnt to a crisp and some don't. I can't seem to understand how it's palatable to taste nothing but flakes off the grill, but we sent it back and weren't charged for it.Shrimp - four pieces of jumbo shrimp in a delicious marinade. This was a very tasty dish, but such a small portion. Chicken - another underwhelming overcooked dish. The asparagus included was also grilled too long and for being one of the more expensive options on the menu, there is not a lot to eat from this pot. You get about four small pieces of chicken to cut off the bone. The chicken itself tasted great, but the amount was hardly satisfying between two people.The service here was great, the food was good, but personally this isn't a location I would hop to again or even consider a must for out-of-towners."
"After getting engaged, my fiancÃ© surprised me with reservations here only a week away. He had booked it months before. It was nice to only have to wait a week!We came in during the start of a 24 hour snow storm and the place was packed and bustling. Rustic and a lot louder than I had imagined with a young crowd. We had 9:45 reservations, but had to wait about 15 minutes.I was debating between 4 or 5 stars. Since it's a place with such a great reputation I thought about it a little while and decided on 4. They can afford it! 5 is just perfection in terms of what I expected.The food was excellent and items aren't outrageously priced. We split everything and indulged a bit since we had a gift card here from my sister and her fiancÃ© - thank you!1. Roasted cauliflower: yum and large portion - packed some to-go2. Chickpea fritters: also delicious 3. Scallops: new dish that day - perfectly cooked!4. Pig face: I was hesitant but it's a patty and the meat is quite tasty - just get it 5. Monkfish: very tasty6. Goat: also very nice7. Dark chocolate / salted caramel ice cream: BOMBWe had really nice service from the bartenders, our host who seated us, and our waitress. A couple things would've been nice: coat check upon getting in and waiting, holding them. They took them once we were seated though. I refilled my wine the whole night.Other than that, it's an experience and I definitely recommend it for people who like trying new things - there were picky eaters next to us and they seemed to be missing out.Make reservations early ... but you knew that already."
"Favorites are the cauliflower and the pig's face. I hear it takes months to get a reservation here. My boyfriend and I were determined to eat there. We went accross the street and went to a brewery while we waited for this place to open. As it did, we were seated without a reservation. However, the waitress told us we had to leave before the reservation party showed up (one hour later). That was fine for us so we go to taste the cauliflower. I want to make this everyday if I can for dinner. It tastes light, healthy, and delicious. One meal I will not forget is the pig's face. It has an egg on top. Seriously, the combination of the yolk to the pig sets off multiple taste receptors in my mouth going off all at once. Get it, you won't regret it!"
"The Grilled Walter's Chicken with Ramp Mole, Giardiniera and Asparagus was fantastic! The Honey Sambal Brioche was delicious!!!!!!!!Have an appetite - so much food and flavor!!!!"
This place is AMAZING!!! The food is heavenly good and the service is great. My party sat at the bar and we were immediately greeted by our very professional bartender. He was very attentive and polite. I would return when I'm in town and order more if my wallet allows.
Hands down my absolute favorite place to eat. Â Fish sauce. Â Oh the glorious fish sauce. Â I love green beans but Izard adds FISH SAUCE to green beans for an explosion of umami. Â I was lucky enough to sit at the counter in the back by the kitchen to watch the chefs cook. Â It's hot back there but they hook you UP. Â It was a great experience with such a friendly staff. Â I will always always always be down for a meal at Girl & The Goat.
"Oh my God, perfect. Hands down, one of the best meals I've eaten in Chicago's amazing restaurant scene. The food was AMAZING (get the goat liver mousse. Please. Also, the roasted cauliflower), the cocktails are well-crafted, the wine is great, the service is outstanding, and the ambiance is stellar (great alt rock playing!). Everything about this place just hummed perfectly. They've created a gem with this one, and I can't wait to go back."
Great food all the way !!!!
"We didn't have reservations but got seated outside almost immediately and it was fine as it was a beautiful night, we probably would have requested to if they hadn't asked. Â Family style seating and small plates to share. We had the Multigrain Bread with Spring Onion Cream Cheese and Cherry Relish, Squash Blossom ""Crab Rangoon"", Soft Shell ""Chili Crab""and diver scallops with stone fruit. Great Food, our food came out at a great pace and we were never waiting for long for anything. Â I will say that 2 couples near us did get their orders messed up though. My husband doesn't eat meat so we stuck with seafood and my husband said the scallops were the best he'd ever had."
"LOVED IT!OK.. OK... It's a pain to get a reservation if you are a procrastinator like me and a month in advance got me a 11:30pm reservation on a Friday night but 2 days before my reservation day, I would constantly check on open table for cancellations and finally was able to switch my reservation for 10:30pm!Once I arrived, I probably waited 30 mins to be seated and tried several things from the menu... Everything was so tasty, I doubt you will regret anything you eat here... A must try is the Escargot Ravioli -- this was definitely my favorite dish -- my mouth is watering!Make a reservation early!"
"Apparently it's a 3 month wait to get a reservation at this place. I can see why. Awesome service and food. Got the goat carpaccio to start, have to try goat since it is called ""girl and the goat"". Also had the best chickpea fritters. Finished it off with the pig face. Too much food for one person but I wiped the plates clean. Too bad I only have one night in Chicago."
"Do you like meat? Do you like things that leave grease stains on your shirt? If you said yes to any of these questions then this is the place for you!Although some dishes look small, do not let it fool you - this food is heavy and it will sit in your gut all day until it becomes a greasy condensed ""kid"" you will drop off at the ""pool"" later...if you know what I mean. Anyways here's what we ordered and what I thought:Escargot Ravioli - meh meh meh. Sort of bland, chewy, and didn't really work as well as I would have hoped. Would have been better if there was some more moisture like a white wine buerre blanc with shallots or something. Instead it had some sort of odd sauce that left everything a bit dry Roasted Pig Face - Greasy bits of yum. After eating this you will feel as if you had just eaten taco bell sober. You will be oddly satisfied but have the saltiest grease hangover you can't even imagine. Definitely tasty and worth it if your cholesterol hasn't reached a dangerously high levelCrumpets and Goat Liver Mousse - MY FAVE DISH. The crumpets were so fluffy and buttery and the mousse was absolutely divine. I could swim in this mousse. If you like pate or any sort of liver you will love this! ABSOLUTELY LOVE. The apple butter on the side is to die for. Literally consumed within a minute Crispy Pork Shank - rather than a description here's my thoughts ""dear lord this is large. are pigs this large? I didn't know they were this large. OH GOD ITS LIKE BACON ITS A BIG GIANT CRISPY PIECE OF BACON. why don't they sell this everywhere? I would have this for breakfast - 'yes I would like 2 poached eggs and A CRISPY PORK SHANK'""Roasted Duck Breast - so mediocre I don't even remember enough to describe it. Overall this place is a solid 3.5 BUT I'm giving it a 4 because the mousse is my life. I wish I could ship that mousse to my house every day. I would literally eat it for breakfast, take the jar with me and lick it clean while I drove to work...just saying."
"I'm a little late writing this, but it wasn't on my priorities to do since once again, the hype of a popular restaurant had me disappointed.I think it's my new thing to not like restaurants that everyone else loves. My mom and I were super excited to come here after all the rave. In Girl & The Goat's defense, we were exhausted from her trip of playing tourists and weren't completely starving. Maybe things would have turned out differently if I had 10 hours of sleep after a long spa day. That being said, the food is strange which I appreciate, but mediocre. I've had so many amazing dishes throughout the Chicago area and none here were included in that list. In fact, I can't even remember what I ate besides a cauliflower dish with way too much mint. Skip the crazy wait at this place and go up the street to Sepia."
"3 words..... Miso Butterscotch Budino.I went to this spot twice in 3 days. Thank you, Stephanie! This dessert should NEVER be taken off your menu. I'm addicted, and need more of it in Seattle."
"Girl & the Goat is effing uh-mazing. This was everything it was hyped up to be. The dining experience is unlike anywhere I've been. Our first time here and we had the chance to sit at the chef's table - highly recommended if you want to experience awesomeness in the making. You are literally 1 foot away from the kitchen and get to see the food go from nothing to something. As a fan of Top Chef, I was super stoked to be able to dine at a winner's real estate. 1. Make reservations.I hear people book dates up to a month in advance - I got lucky and found a reservation one day in advance. If you have a table of two, request the chef's table :D2. Order multiple dishes. I'd recommend a bread, 2 veggies, and 2 meats or 1 fish and 1 meat - all for a table of two. Those 4-5 dishes are somewhat small portions but lets you sample multiple flavor profiles. I'd recommend the sautÃ©ed green beans, pan fried shishito peppers, wood oven roasted pig face, gouda bacon bread. 3. Finish with dessert. The plantain cake is impressive. I enjoyed every single scrumptious bite. The cake (banana flavored) is topped with chocolate chip ice cream, then surrounded by passion fruit sauce. The dessert was not too sweet, and was perfectly balanced with the tartness from the passion fruit. Great combination. It's like peanut butter & jelly round 2, or burgers with pickles x 1000 - it just works. This place is a must try - not if you're in Chicago, but in your entire lifetime. It's no surprise everyone talks about Girl & the Goat."
"If you are looking for a fun night out, Â Girl & The Goat should be high on that list. Â While I have never heard of anyone describing Girl & The Goat as a gastropub, Â that is what it essentially is. I will admit we came in primarily for that Top Chef experience. Â What we found Â was a playful menu, fun lively vibe, exceptionally professional service, Â and down right banging grub to go with our craft beer.We were very fortunate to have been seated at 2 of the 4 seats on the kitchen line. Â When they say kitchen line, Â they are not kidding! Â You are right in the chefs faces and what an amazing experience that was for us. Â It was incredible to watch these chefs at work. Â The amount of preparation and work is apparent. Â Throughout the night, Â the chefs kept an upbeat pace and were working with consistency and familiar comfortability. Â Not gonna lie but I had to control my inner Alton Brown as I was tempted to narrate more than once during the night. Girl & The Goat does small plates and breaks their menu into vegetables, Â fish, Â meat, and bread. We ordered a sampling off each section of the menu and found each dish distinct and well executed. Some of the meat dishes when eaten alone tended on the heavy side but went perfectly well with our beers. The big surprise of the night was the broccoli, smokey from the grill and topped with a creamy blue cheese sauce and crunchy flavored rice krispies, it was a taste and texture explosion. Â I had never seen Kenny V. devour any vegetable with the same enthusiasm as he devours meat, and here he was spooning heaps of it onto his plate. Â Overall, we came in for the Top Chef experience and sitting at the kitchen line truly delivered."
"There are no words for G&G ~ this place is amazing! Â If you're going to be in Chi, make reservations in advance. This place is packed for good reason! Â I made reservations a month out and the options available were 5:30pm or 9:45pm. Â I can't remember everything we had - but here are a few things I can't forget!..+ Wood oven roasted pig face (my favorite!)Slices of pig meat with a sunny side egg on top. (Did someone say there was an egg on top?!) Â You mash everything together and cut into pieces - I'm salivating as I type this ~ Â Yummmmmmm, SO GOOD! Â The flavor was amazing. This is a signature G&G dish so you HAVE to try it! Â + Confit goat belly.You can't come here and not have anything with the word 'goat' in it! Â There's butter, lobster and crab in it ~ Mmmmm!! Â It's tender and a liiiiiitle gamey (which I can't stand) - but it was still good!+ Miso-butterscotch budino. We were absolutely stuffed by this point, but there was no way I was leaving without dessert. Our waitress recommended the bundino and I'm so glad we took her up on it! Â I don't even know what a bundino is, but it was REALLLLYYYYY good! Â The best dessert I've had bar none ~ besides, you can't go wrong with candied cashews!Everything here is delicious! Â This is the BEST meal I've had in Chicago (beating both Grace and BOKA)."
"The bread and butter are delicious. I had a variety of their vegetarian options and enjoyed all of it. It was a few months wait before we got in, but enjoyed our time there. Recommended if you can get in."
"Pretty good gelato! Â Came here in the middle of the week, in the middle of he day. Â No wait and helpful staff. Â The woman working was really generous with the samples. Â Decent prices.The place had a funky smell to it (mildew?) but seemed clean. Â Aside from two benches outside, there's no outdoor seating and due to the smell, none of us wanted to stay inside.Some of the more memorable flavors include Sesame Fig, Goat Cheese Caramel Cashew, Raspberry Cabernet, Rosemary Irish Cream, Strawberry Balsamic. Â I tried the Raspberry Cabernet and the Rosemary Irish Cream - both excellent!I didn't check this out too closely but it looked like they sell pints of 1 day old gelato at a discounted price?"
The menu changes all the time. I love this place- see my prior reviews. Â Here's what you should get:Chickpea frittersDuck tonguePig facePork shank Butterscotch bodino
"Not much more I can say that everyone else have already said. Â Not only is every item on the menu exploding with flavor, but the service is exceptional. Not to mention, they serve your orders in perfect timing. Â Not all at once, and not to spread out. Â I've been here a hand full of time, and every single time, I have been treated like I own the place. I once brought a friend for her birthday, but made no special request for the occasion. Â However, our wonderful waitress over heard our birthday conversation and at the end of our dinner, she brought us a little piece of cake with a candle shinning bright. She gently set it down and softly said, ""Happy Birthday"", then walked away. Â Now that is the kind of service that every restaurant should learn from. Â Girl & the Goat goes above and beyond Â the expectations with food and service and all other restaurant owners should come here and learn what a restaurant experience should be like."
"In my recent trip to Chicago, this was my favorite of all the restaurants I tried. Â Made reservations for dinner at 9pm. Â Got to the restaurant right at 9pm and was seated within 5 minutes of checking in which is always a plus. Â I would describe the atmosphere inside and hip, trendy, and cool. Â We ordered what the waitress recommended to us. Â All of the dishes were outstanding. Â My favorites were the cauliflower, grilled octopus, goat, short ribs, and trout. Â The table next to us got the roasted pig face which looked really good too. Â All small sized dishes so it's a perfect place to try many things on the menu. Â For dessert we shared the Butterscotch Budino. Â It was off the charts delicious. Â Can't comment on the cocktails since none of us really drank. Â Would definitely come back here again. Â Great date place or a place to celebrate a special occasion."
"There is such a thing as too much flavor. I didn't realize G&G was Tapas-style until the server informed us (I obvi didn't do my Yelper research). Sharing bites from small-dishes as they come is not my ideal dinner setup. The entire meal felt like an appetizer.We ordered a lot, and you kind of have to if you want G&G to be a meal and not just a snack. Everything was really, really flavorful. The vegetable dishes stood out to me more than the seafood/meats. Lamb shank was great, and if/when I come back, I might just order that for myself and not share at all.Halfway through dinner, I just wanted bread on the side to help balance out the richness of every. single. bite. Actually, bread would've been too much. I just wanted a bowl of dough to munch on. My tongue was yearning for a scoop of vanilla bean ice cream by the time we got to dish 6 out of 10. I needed a counter food, and that's all I could think about -- that's how tastebud-numbing G&G is.G&G is a good restaurant, great even. You just have to be into that kind of dining, and I recognized that it's not my thing. I'd very much rather have a single plate that I can focus on, and be able to taste the original flavor of whatever I'm eating with the help of spices/sauces, not the other way around."
"Faves: kohlrabi salad, duck tongue, goat belly. Butterscotch Bodoni. Amazing menu. Great service. Follow up: for my last meal dessert: butterscotch Bodoni with pineapple and roasted cashews."
I ate here two years ago. Remember a Brussels sprouts side dish. Found the meal enjoyable
Love the food. Had 4 different things and they all were great. great atmosphere as well.
"Had dinner with my daughter who I was visiting in Chicago. We sat at the counter adjacent to the kitchen which was a lot of fun but a little on the warm side. Â The food was amazing! Â We had a variety of dishes including roasted cauliflower, sautÃ©ed green beans, escargot ravioli, crisp braised pork shank and goat empanadas. Â Every dish was well executed and extremely flavorful with the pork shank and the goat empanadas being the standout dishes. Â We brought a great bottle of Patz and Hall single vineyard Pinot Noir with us and were disappointed that for the $25 corkage fee our wine was poured into stemless glasses. Â I realize that the restaurant is quite casual but the service should match the high quality of the food. If not, the corkage fee should be greatly reduced.The atmosphere was upbeat as the restaurant was bustling and noisy but in a good way as it added an element of excitement to the overall experience.Our server was casual and informative at the same time and provided us with very good recommendations.Even with my issue with the glassware the food was at such a high level that it was one of the best meals that I have had in a long time."
One word: Octopus!
It was very good! Lovely atmosphere and delicious! The roasted cauliflower is a must order!
"My dad raved about this place, so we made reservations in July.... yes, JULY. Of course my father scrutinized the menu prior to arrival well aware of what he was going to order. When I looked at the menu a few weeks prior to flying out to Chicago, I thought; ""Why doesn't anything look good on this menu?""Frankly I was worried since nothing looked especially tempting. Was I simply not hungry that day? When I have ever NOT wanted food? I glanced over the menu again and thought I'll just figure out what I want to eat when I get there. I was worried about the hype that has followed this restaurant, and fearful that's all this place will be ... hype.Well.... WRONG! This place is everything and more! The food, the decor, the fantastic staff -- we couldn't have been happier.My dad instantly rattled off what he wanted; Chickpea Fritter, Roasted Pig Face, and Braised Pork Shank. I just glanced down and saw Pan Seared Diver Scallops and Wood-grilled Broccoli, since it didn't look like we were having any vegetables during our *meatwave* vacation. The scallop dish was a quantity of 2, so they asked if we would like an additional scallop -- we happily accepted. Each item that came to our table was consumed instantly, our last item that came out was the pork shank, and at that point we were actually full -- and it was HUGE! We had the remaining pork shank and broccoli wrapped up to go...... that my father was happily eating for breakfast in the morning. I was so ticked, my stomach was growling all morning thinking about the SAME thing!"
"With over 3000 reviews, I can only add my impressions of the dishes:Best:Octopus (W.O.W.)Taco bread (such an interesting concept...flavors you know well presented in a way you've never tried!)Good:Pig face (I am a pork lover, yet it was SO rich you probably only want two bites...best for sharing!)Beet salad (too heavy on the salt)Goat empanada (I actually tried goat, and it wasn't as scary as I'd feared :) )Pierogies (served almost crunchy, so I'd avoid ordering these and the empanadas together b/c of textural similarity)Oh, and I guess I can also add that this space is so sexy that it seemed to really, uh, inspire the couple next to us to practically climb on top of each other as their meal ended. They luckily left before things got out of hand, but as Jordan Baker in Gatsby suggests, maybe there's something ironically more ""intimate"" about ""large parties"" like the one Girl and the Goat throws every night: it's easier to feel anonymous (and amorous?) amidst the noise and the scene."
"Hmmmm, where do I start. Â A 45 minute wait with reservations is unacceptable. Â So, already the dining experience is off to a bad start. Â While, the actual food experience was rather different, you can't let that overshadow the actual flavors of the food. Â Let's be real.....some of the dishes were good like the pork shank and green beans and some were lacking something like the broccoli and pig face."
"It is hard to get reservations here, and I'm not one to wait around an hour for a table. (Usually, when I get to a restaurant, it's because I'm already hungry.) But this is why you plan ahead. The Girl and the Goat is a great place to treat yourself (and out-of-town guests) to great small plates of food. Every once in a blue moon, I'll show up for a special late-night dinner with a couple of dear friends with healthy appetites. G&G's reservations open up three months in advance, and while most of the dinner rush time slots (7 pm Â - 9 pm) are probably snatched up, as soon as they are posted, I've usually been able to reserve 10 p.m. reservations without much trouble. Since I've usually gone with a group of people open to sharing plates (duh), I've been able to sample a good assortment of the menu.The pig face and pork belly are among the best options on the menu - flavorful and almost soporifically rich although well-balanced by their crisp garnishes. Last time around, the sugo was an escargot bucatini that we all enjoyed, and I remember the roasted cauliflower being great and the chickpea fritters being elegantly light, though thoroughly spiced and fried.I hate to say it, but it's probably the goat options on the G&G's menu that are the most consistently disappointing. The goat belly comes in a pool of sugar-sweet butter flecked haphazardly with lobster. The goat empanadas (a measly two) suffer from comparison with the more generous portions found elsewhere -- and they are merely decent empanadas. Of all the goat options I've tried so far here (and at Izard's much less deservedly lauded Little Goat Diner nearby), none of them really seem to capitalize or intelligently complement the gamier flavor profile of goat meat. (And this is a town where due appreciation of goat is easily found in any number of taquerÃ­as specializing in birria de chivo.)Thankfully, by the end of the meal, we're usually not hankering for dessert, which makes the limited dessert options more of a blessing than a problem. (And they're all very grown-up desserts too, an excellent contrast to the over-the-top confections at Little Goat).Service is always prompt, and with the tapas-like approach of the menu, I'm never too bothered about dishes coming in as they're ready -- the kitchen usually does a good job of spacing these apart, and we've never been overwhelmed by having more than 3 dishes at a time. This is a solid restaurant of consistently high quality. Just plan ahead and use the buddy system (more people = more dishes to try)."
"It was a bit noisy, but, we knew that it would be, ahead of time. Â I wanted to treat my best friend for an early birthday dinner. She LOVEd it ! My other friend has food allergies, so, our waiter consulted with the kitchen and came back with an amended menu for her. Â While I appreciated certain aspects of the service, some of the dishes were a bit salty for my taste. Â My fave was my Horchata Rice Pudding , which is primarily the reason the rating made it to three stars."
"During my 3 day Chicago trip with my girl friends, this was our NUMBER ONE place to try while we were in Chicago. I mean with the most and top rated restaurant in Chicago, who wouldn't want to try this place?With the high recognition and popularity, the restaurant was already filled with reservations and we weren't able to reserve until 11:30PM. But who cares, we scheduled around our reservation to make sure we were here.The service was great, our waiter was SO nice (so sad that I can't remember his name) and recommended all the right dishes for us.I'm actually writing the review a year later so I forgot all the things we ordered but let me tell you... EVERYTHING we ordered was on point. Food is amazing and the ambience is very hippie and casual and opens late.I will definitely come back next time I'm in town."
"Phenomenal dinner and experience!! Food was just as expected... unique ingredients and delicious!!Food- sharing plates (larger than tapas, smaller than entrees). For 2 ppl we ordered 5 dishes, plus brad and dessert. Left feeling full (not overtly stuffed) and satisfied!! Bittersweet chocolate dessert was ah-mazing!!!Ambiance- exposed brick on the ceiling, wood everywhere. Very cool. Very city. Make reservation early!! We were fortunate to get a table for 2, but I've heard (and saw) the communal seating tables. If you're not into that (which I'm not- especially when you are out for an expensive meal)- be sure to make the request."
Just go plain and simple. I promise if you eat meat you won't regret it. Â New to Chicago and it's my favorite place so far.
By far one of my Chicago favorites! Def get the goat empanadas and goat ribs (seldom offered). Make your reservations in advance as getting in can be very difficult unless you find a spot at the bar.
"A place that is famous, always busy, makes a ton of cash, and is generous enough to squeeze you in at 4:30 when it requires reservations? Yes, yes, yes! That is awesome and I love it! They let us sit at a big table with other guest and told us we needed to be done by 6pm, easy enough for me.So they do the shared plate concept here, so it is best to get a few dishes to try. The menu is very unique so I would encourage others to enjoy the creations they offer you.-Beet Salad was very good, had a nice dressing and delicious avocado with it. One of the best salads I've had.-The ham frites were a standard raiser when it comes to fries/frites. Please if you love fries, order this for me and thank me later? They come with two sauces. I could kiss these fries and not feel ashamed.-If you see pig face on the menu it's safe to say you will most likely strike up a conversation with your table and server. Of course we had to try, it's served in patty form, fried potato sticks, with a fried egg, and served with a little sauce. You mix it up and eat it, trust me it is good.-Finally the pig shank, very tender and then fried right before serving. Very good flavor and crunch too it, had two sauces that come with it as well. Really impressed with all of their dishes, I was so full after eating this one.Excellent service from all of the staff members, I had such a wonderful experience here. Can't wait to go back and try some more!"
"Thank you everyone at Girl & the Goat for all the hard work you put in every night to make our dining experiences unforgettable! Hard work is an understatement for these guys... We made reservations around 1.5 months ahead of time and arrived at dinner much earlier than the time reserved. They surprised us by sitting us within 5 minutes at the kitchen (seated for 2) - we were EXCITED... It was great watching the kitchen in action! The hardest part is choosing which dish you want to try. We got 5 1/2 dishes... And we were upset our tummies couldn't bear anymore... We had the chickpea fritters, halibut, escargot ravioli, small side of roasted broccoli (complimentary of the kitchen - I think it's because of where we were seated), pig face, and goat belly for TWO. ALL the dishes were superb... Halibut was a huge winner for us, but all the dishes were so good that if you're from out of town.... I recommend making reservations for at least two nights so you can come back and enjoy the other dishes as well (or repeat your favorites). Bravo, girl and the goat... Thank you so much again!!!"
"Have been there at least 5x. Â Have had everything from pig face to oysters to goat carpaccio from the menu. Â The food is fabulous. Â The service is fantastic. Â The decor is hip. Â The prices are, yes, astonishingly reasonable given the quality of the food served. Â However, one huge slip up, which reduces this from 5 stars to 4: Â we requested decaffeinated coffee after dinner, at 11 pm. Â We received caffeinated coffee. Â I asked the server twice to check to be sure that it was decaffeinated. Â She assured me that she had checked herself. Â It was not. Â We were up, in a hellish way, until well into the morning. Â That was the only bad experience we have had, but it was such a blatant oversight and one that terrible restaurants get right that I have never requested decaf coffee from them again. Â If anything, the servers' opinions are looked at with some suspicion and I prefer to get the dishes I've already had."
"Yum Yum YumMy gf and I beasted here. I placed a reservation a month in advance, and we still had to resort to a late dinner time...9:30 i think our reservation was for 2?We beasted on Roasted Oysters, Goat Carpaccio, Crudo, Dumplings, Scallops, Kalbi Ribs, Broccoli, Pig Face, and Budino.The broccoli was just a bit too much food for us. It was too filling for the lack of protein. Overall, to be honest, I don't remember each of the dishes individually. I just remember they were all yummy and i'll be back again the next time i'm in Chicago.Stephanie Izard - You ROCK!"
This may be my only 5 star rating in my yelp profile. Â And they are worth it. Â  Â This is my wife and I's favorite restaurant and that's saying a lot considering the list if restaurants we've been to. Â  Pig face is a must!!! Â  Â  After two years tonight we are making another trip there tonight. Â Very excited.
"The food here is delicious if you can find a place to sit and eat. If you don't have reservations, then I recommend going with a small party (2 people), so you can wedge your way in at the bar or lounge area. When the wait is too long, I recommend going across the street or down the street. There are a lot of good restaurants in the area. The food is good here, but not SO good that I would wait for more than 20-30min. I love the wood oven roasted pig face and deep fried cowboy oysters. None of the veggie dishes were very memorable the first time. Now I usually stick to the meat and fish dishes."
Went with a friend and her family- food was amazing. I ate 12 different animals that night. Hated myself the next day. Great service and presentation. Great wine list as well
"wowowow those crispy chick pea fritters. they are smooth on the inside and crispy and hot on the outside. I burned the roof of my mouth because they were so fresh. I recommend coming early, eating at the bar or lounge if you can't get a reservation. I also find that eating in smaller parties are better. what's amazing is that you can get half portions on most of the items on the menu! besides the chick pea fritters, the escargot ravioli is outstanding, the kohkari salad was excellent and the halibut was good too. I would not recommend the scallops (no good)."
"Always absolutely amazing!!! The service in incredible! The atmosphere is wonderful! You have to make reservations weeks in advance, but if you go right when they open, you can easily sit at the bar eat there. The cocktails are wonderful! Not a single complaint! Just be ready- the food is super rich, if your body isn't used to that, it may be a little upset in the end. Â No regrets though!And by the way- DO NOT leave there without getting the green beans. seriously!"
Any place bold enough to serve cauliflower as a main entree and have it be the highlight of an already outstanding experience is pretty dope.
I was in the girl & the goat. Portions extremely small you have to order a lot of meals to have 1 meal! And expensive!
"Intriguing and unique small plates with a great ambiance. Always make it a point to come here when back in Chicago. Try to book your reservation early, as they fill up quickly."
"We came here for an early dinner. Â The service was great and overall the food was amazing. Â We ordered:Johnny applecheese bread: Â The bread was good, warm, and fresh. Â The oil was fine but nothing special and the butter could have used more chili. Â Overall, it was not a bad dish but it was not great.Confit goat belly: Â The goat was amazing and worked well with the crab meat. Â I was worried that the goat would overpower the seafood but they actually balanced each other well. Â Wood oven roasted pig face: Â This is tied for my favorite dish. The pork was perfectly cooked and crispy without being dry. Â The cilantro sauce was great assuming you like cilantro (which I do) Â I would have like more egg but that is a minor complaint.Grilled baby octopus: Â This is my other favorite item of the evening. Â the octopus was not rubbery like you get a lot. Â The vinaigrette was nice and refreshing. Â The pistachios added a like of nice texture. Â It was a nice light dish that I would happily order again.Celery root and cheddar dumplings: Â This was my least favorite dish. Â I did not like the texture of the filling, the dish needed more acid, and I did not get any cheddar flavor. Â It was not a bad dish but I would not order it again.Miso-butterscoth budino: Â The texture of the budino was perfect and the flavors was nuanced and not overtly sweet. Â I could eat a whole bowl of the candied cashews alone. Â Overall, it was an amazing dessert."
"This restaurant is superb. As of right now, I am the fullest I've ever been after a meal and it's because that even after my stomach was like, ""No, stop eating, I am full!"" my mouth was still like, ""GOTTA HAVE EVERYTHING."" All of the food was sinfully good. On top of that, great service that was attentive throughout the meal even though the restaurant was quite big and had many diners in it. My boyfriend and I came here mostly knowing what we wanted to try (because I had stalked Yelp endlessly after finally snagging a last minute reservation a few weeks back). We decided on Italian sausage bread with fennel butter and pickled spread (sad that the Applecheese bread was not there), green beans, the broccoli, the trout with clams and goat liver mousse, and of course, the pig face. The bread: filled with delicious pieces of sausage, but I was not as into the butter and pickled spread as I thought I would be. However, the bread itself was so good that in the end I was glad that the butter was so mild because it allowed me to taste the meaty flavor of the bread. My boyfriend, who is really into bread, really enjoyed it as well.Broccoli: SO, SO GOOD. The dish looked deceptively simple but we actually finished the whole plate! There is also a lot of broccoli, by the way. We kept trying to figure out how they made it so deliciously smoky, but we couldn't! The slight tanginess from the blue cheese and the rice krispies added flavor and texture depth. Delicious.Trout: another winner! The fish was cooked PERFECTLY with crispy skin on one side. It fell apart when poked with a fork, and we mixed it with the mousse and clams and it was so creamy, yet not overpoweringly rich. Still super decadent though. I was so surprised at how well it meshed with the slight flavor of goat! Another great dish with flavor and texture depth.Green beans: simple veggie dish, BUT SO DELICIOUS. I think I was surprised at how tangy the sauce was - you can definitely taste the fish sauce! The beans were also snappy, fresh and juicy so they were a delight to eat. Not sure why the cashews were included though - felt a bit out of place.Pig face: favorite dish from the night! So rich and delicious - we polished it off in 10 minutes even though it was the last dish to arrive at the table. Ridiculously, sinfully good. ORDER IT.Overall, amazing experience! The restaurant has such a cool vibe (romantic... but also loud???), definitely a must-visit for any Chicago foodie. I'd come back in a heartbeat... well, after I digest this meal first."
"Oh nom nom nom nom. I lived in Chicago for years but never got to go and finally had a chance when I was in town for a conference. We walked in on a Saturday night and my friend was told it'd be a 2-hour wait. I went back in to leave a number and a table had opened up, with the stipulation that we needed to be done by a certain time since that's when the table had a reservation. Cool with us. I got a taglioni to drink and we started with some johnny apple cheese, which was sooo smooth and delicious. I wasn't the biggest fan of the shishito peppers my friend ordered but then again I'm just not a huge fan of them in the first place. We also got scallops, octopus, quail, and of course, goat -- went with the goat belly. Everything was very well done and presented and although it seemed like the plates were small, we ended up quite full. Don't know how the desserts are as we went to Mindy's Hot Chocolate for that, but I hear it's good! The service was great, very attentive, and they pace out the dishes very well. Bill before tip for 3 people was around $155 and that included 5 cocktails."
"We were lucky and got inside without reservation - premium seats - right in front of the kitchen.Staff was super friendly and professional. Food was exceptional. People inside - friendly and with good vibe.We ordered roasted beets, escargot ravioli, and wood oven roasted pig face. Salad was good, ravioli - yummy, pig face exceeded expectations. I was a little bit nervous about the pig face, thought I was about to see an actual face. What a relief when server brought a dish without a pig head ;)).With every dish servers gave a short presentation of the dish explaining what it includes and how it was cooked. I loved that.After consuming all of the above, we decides to order roasted cauliflower. It was outstanding!I cannot wait to come back!"
"Lived up to the hype. The goat empanadas, the pigs face, the oysters were all delicious and slightly different than what you would get anywhere else- they put a spin on all their recipes! The star of the show however, was the halibut with blueberry nuoc cham. AMAZING flavour combination, I can't imagine how they come up with these things. As a special note, service here was outstanding. Very efficient without being intrusive. The waitstaff worked as a team- if any of them was passing by they would reflll our glasses or take away a plate. We loved our meal here"
"I don't know if we just ordered the wrong thing, but after months of anticipation to finally go here, I left feeling disappointed.The wood grilled broccoli was okay for a couple bites, but the smoke flavor was overpowering and there's no way we could eat the massive plate of smoky broccoli between two people. It got disgusting fast, I wouldn't recommend it. The chickpea fritters which were probably the best part of the entire meal, and our neighbors got the cauliflower and wouldn't shut up about how good it was. We should have got that instead of the broccoli.We also tried the pig face after the rave reviews here on yelp. It was good, I would recommend it if you haven't had it yet, but I don't think I'd order it again. I also wasn't a fan of the scallops here, they were a little overcooked. The goat dish with a berry dressing we ordered was good. I don't see it on the menu now so I don't remember what it was called.I guess I can say I've been here now, but it didn't live up to the hype."
"Having read about this place, Girl & The Goat was on goto list for sometime now. Made sure to visit them during my recent visit to Chi town.First of all it's hard to get a table reservation even few weeks in advance. I opted to get a spot on the bar, had to wait 20 mins to get that spot. They do have a waiting area with comfy sofas while one waits for the table.Ambiance is lovely out here.This place is full of activity and is very spacious. The other side of restaurant has a semi open kitchen where one could see the chefs working hard to dish out the awesome food.The bartender was really helpful and helped me to make selections. The menu is not huge but everything sounds so delicious. Had the following delicacies -* Wood Fired Oysters* Goat Belly* The Pig Face* Date Cake with Almond HalvaThe oysters were baked at the right temperature, goat belly was small but decent. Pig face was a surprise and ended up the most tasty dish which I had. It had that crunchiness which added a twist to it. Loved the dessert too.With all that food and 2 glasses of wine I was $115(with tip) lighter on my wallet. I would come back."
"Where to begin.... We made reservations in February for May, and it was 110% worth the wait. Upon arrival, we were promptly seated at the ""Chef's Table,"" our server greeted us and walked us through how things work. After deciding on a fabulous bottle of wine, we ordered our 4-course meal up front. First up: the chickpea fritters. They were insanity, and I'd come back every day to eat them if I could. We were complimentary given green beans which we probably should've ordered anyway. It was a plentiful serving, so we ate them throughout the meal with smiles on our faces. Next up, from Sous Chef Andrea's suggestion, we had the halibut. It was in this blueberry compote type sauce and it truly melted in your mouth. Each meal promptly followed the next, so the goat empanadas were up. The avocado base really added to the heaviness of the goat. As a meal finale, we ordered the pig face. I wasn't a huge fan as I prefer leaner cuts of meat, but my boyfriend probably would've bathed himself in it daily if he could've. The amazing chefs somehow convinced us to order desert, so we had the butterscotch bead pudding with candied pineapple and bacon, and they also brought out a complimentary rice pudding with rhubarb. Desert. Was. Delectable. The only thing that could've made things better was thanking Stephanie Izard herself for the amazing meal. Hopefully it won't take us another 3 months to get another reservation. This was easily the best service, food, and atmosphere I've yet to experience in Chicago. Do yourself a favor and call for a reservation right now."
"This has been on my foodie bucket list for awhile and I was not disappointed. In town for a meeting so six of us came in for dinner and even without a reservation, had an outstanding experience eating in the bar. The service was on point and the food...annexing. We tried too many things to name, all totally satisfying. Wish I lived here! I'd definitely come here often!"
"Came here after the 2014 Chicago Marathon for a 4:30 reservation and felt that it was a GREAT place! Â I came all the way from Boston and booked this reservation months in advance; they gave us the first seating of the night and our waiter was attentive, knowledgeable, and great and educating us on the menu.The La Paloma cocktail was amazing and they have a great hard cider selection with local ones made in Michigan. Â We had the cauliflower, octopus, trout (which was the best), and the pig's face. I ate everything except for the Pig's Face.The best part of this restaurant is that its actually QUIET and you can HEAR you company. I am only 27 but I still have such a hard time hearing people when out at restaurants + I loved how easy it was to hear my friends and cover comfortably from the marathon over cocktails and good food.I am extremely healthy so found the food a little too greasy for my liking but overall A+ and would for sure come back again! I highly recommend and love how its large, has nice bathrooms, and the wait staff was really nice!For SURE will come back again!Tamara"
"What a fabulous experience!Girl and the Goat is definitely along the most popular restaurants in Chicago. From what I hear, it is VERY tough to get a table. However I went there with a party of 4, no reservation, and were given a table straight away! It might've helped we were going for dinner at 11:00pm... God bless Latino dinner times!The experience is all about sharing. Plates are small, so you'd want to order several. We had so many great things that I can't recall all of them. I believe these are all we had:-Hamachi crudo-Goat empanadas (my favorite!)-Roasted beets-Escargot Ravioli-Oven roasted quail-Pork Shank (second favorite)You can't really go wrong here, everything was delightful. Book in advance. This place is fabulous and has righteously gained its reputation."
"A fellow Yelper was right to call this a Goatgasm. I would have NEVER expected to enjoy this place as much as I did. Many times, the most talked about, hard to get into establishments are overrated or too fancy to fully appreciate. This is not the case with Girl and the Goat. I was blown away with 95% of the items we tried. Even the items I would be inclined to pass on the next time were flavorful and memorable.... And believe me, there will be a next time. We re-booked before we left. I also enjoyed watching the cooks and prep cooks whip it up. There were no measuring cups for anything. They were throwing a pinch of this and scoop of that all night long. Another treat of the night was that a few people in our party of 11 had dietary restrictions (gluten free and Pescatarian). Most of our items could not be modified for them but they prepared a small portion for them when the ingredients allowed them to do so. Of the 30 menu items, we had 14. Including the coveted, pre order required goat leg. Â We also tried all of the desserts. Â And we also ordered 2 types of bread. IMO, bread should be free especially if you spend $600. *shrugsFOOD: Bread - 3 stars; decent but not worth $6Goat Leg - 5 stars (was tender like roast and served with bread, boiled egg and 5 dipping sauces) ...Must be pre-ordered and cost is based per .lb. Fried Pickles - Â 5 stars Roasted Cauliflower - 4 stars Roasted Beets - Â 3 stars (not a beet fan but they were the best I have ever had) Sauteed Green Beans - 5 stars (you absolutely have to get them); served with fish sauce and a lemon vinaigrette. Escargot Ravoli - Â 4 stars Duck Tongue - 5 stars (It was the one of the best dishes of the night) Sugo with Parpadelle - 5 stars (delicious' recommended by the bartender) Hamachi Crudo - 4 stars Diver Scallops - Â 5 stars (* meaty Â and served with pieces of bacon) Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - 5 stars (the other star of the night. Â It was so good. Better than bacon good!) A must try. .... It is a scary thought but one bite will clear your mind of its name. Lamb Ribs Â - 4 Â stars Crisp Braised Pork Shank - 4.5 stars Goat Empanadas - 3.5 stars (good but not mind blowing) DESSERT:I do not remember all the names. We tried the Sticky cake, Plantain dessert and Miso Butterscotch Budino. My favorite was the Miso Butterscotch. It was the perfect sweet and salty combo. COST: Excluding gratuity, we spent about $50 per person (food only). We all left stuffed and we were sent home with lots of leftovers. MISC: The service was great. Our server was on it! She was very accommodating from start to finish. The place is dimly lit. It was pretty but impractical. Reading the menu was more difficult than it is for a person over 65 to read the last line of letters at the optometrist. It was also very loud. Worth the noise though. The $11 valet parking was also a welcomed offering. Parking can be a bit of a nightmare in this area."
"Went here last night without reservations but got super lucky and got seats at the bar. Ordered the roasted cauliflower, halibut (yummy) and the chicken. Â Definitely worth a visit."
"Girl and the Goat definitely doesn't need ANOTHER 5 star review but they sure do deserve as many as they receive. Â The food is delicious and there is so much unique variety in each dish. As thousands before me have said, the shishito peppers, pigs face, octopus, hamachi crudo, and pork shank MUST be ordered. Cocktails are good but I've had better in the city... Bottom line is you come here for the food. This is important: just because the restaurant says they don't have any reservations for three more months does NOT mean you shouldn't just go a few hours before you get hungry, grab a drink from the bar (or from Lone Wolf, or Avec, or Haymarket, or any of the million other places nearby) and just wait it out. The restaurant will be completely packed no matter the time of day, and it is very loud, but always a good time in a lively atmosphere."
"So, its been almost 3 months since my legendary (in my head anyway!) foodie crawl though the Windy City. Â I've never done anything like that before, and I wasn't sure what to expect. Â It turned out to be quite the experience-- great eatin', hospitable people, and a beautiful city. Â My friend and I ended up with the perfect itinerary-- we tried many places but were hardly ever too full and got a lot of walking in between.The #1 spot in Chicago for me, the place that lingers above all others as a food memory (even months later as I write this from halfway around the world in the Middle East) is G&tG. Â The food was SO tasty, this was to be our only evening meal and so we ordered quite a few small plates to share. Â The way chef Izard puts tastes together is so amazing! Â We started with shishito peppers (pan fried with parmesan, sesame, and miso), diver scallops (pan seared with cubano pork, apple mojo, and pepper-raisin relish), and a loaf of johnny applecheese bread (served with chili-cheddar butter and malted oil). Â Yum! To wash it down, I ordered a glass of rose and my friend went with the house (goat) red.Moving onto our next course, we went with the confit goat belly (bourbon butter, lobster n' crab, and fennel) and pig face. Â I hadn't heard of pig face before, but this was the 3rd one I've had this year-- the first was at Animal in LA in June, the 2nd earlier in the day at Purple Pig. Â All delicious, so big fan of the ""Pig Face"" now!! :) Â At G&tG, it was wood oven roasted with a sunny-side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, and potato stix. Â Hom Nom!!We finished with the pb&j dessert-- salted peanut kulfi, concord grape granita, and brioche donuts. Â Perfect finish to the perfect meal.Besides the excellent food, service was steller! Our server, Kelly, was so warm and friendly and we discovered she's originally from Vashon Island in the Pac NW ;). Â After hearing how big of a fan I am, she even asked Chef Izard to stop by our table before she left for the night. Stephanie is as down to earth as I had expected but she looked so tired that I decided not to ask for a picture as planned.Finally, the atmosphere was packed and buzzing, with the kind of vibe of a great (not merely good) restaurant.With an extensive menu which I get a feeling is seasonal, G&tG is the kind of place I'd return often if I lived local, in order to try it all! Â It easily gets my #1 vote of the 17 places we tried... ;)"
"I called three months in advance for G&TG for a 7pm Sat reservation and that time wasn't available. Â Even crazier, when we got there on time, we were told it would be another half hour until our table was ready. Â Given all the hype around this place... Â I sure as heck hoped that it would be worth the fuss, and overall, I think it was.The food itself is what I'd call creative gastropub tapas. Â Lots of small dishes that you and a partner can assemble Kore or less into your own distinct tasting menu. Â The real rock stars we had we the kholarabi salad, the grilled broccoli, the halibut, and last but not least, the infamous pig face. Â Everything else was good, but not necessarily unique.Service is what really what granted G&TG the 5 star nod. Â From the food to the wine, we felt like we were treated like royalty by servers who knew the menu like an Encyclopedia Britannica. Â Honestly for the price, this place is a steal on taste and experience.One word of advice though... Â Skip the dessert. Â All of them were bland and not really up to the rest of the meal."
"I thoroughly enjoyed Girl and the Goat. Best thing: a lot of their plates can be ordered as half portions, so definitely ask in advance about that. I really love small plates, so this was the perfect place for me!Shishito Peppers: AMAZING Parmesan cheese crust. A must try.Wood Grilled Broccoli: These have a really really intense smokey flavor. I would pass on this next time.Chickpea Fritter: We got this because everyone seems to rave about this dish. It was very interesting with a neat mix of ingredients and flavors. Has an east Asian flare.Frog Legs: Yum! Super good...just watch out for the little bones.Honey Sambal Brioche: Definitely get this...the bread is delectable. One of the best plates we tried.Goat Empanadas: Really unique idea and super tasty.All in all, I really appreciated the creativity of this restaurant. I highly recommend this for the ambiance and the amazing small plate options. You can't go wrong with any of the choices, as everything is a little daring with a really nice mix of flavors."
"I live for the French toast here. I worship at the alter of Stephanie izard's soft, juicy moist, slurpy, sweet French .. Uh.. Toast. So what if my cholesterol goes up the wazoo and my heart rate cranks up. Seriously though, service is pretty good and the coffee isn't bad either. My only complaint is the wait for a table. Every time I go here I try to order something else but .... the French toast calls to me. My wife left me because i do this and then, came back because no one else would have her, but I'd trade her for the French toast any day."
"First dinner in chicago with my wife and family. Hands down one of the best places to eat! You have to eat anything that has pork in it! The last dish that came out was on the bone and by far the best meat I have ever eaten! The mood was dim lights and great for a date night or for a group for a high class dinning experience. And the waiter was extremely helpful in deciding what to get! Make a reservation as early as you can, you will not regret it!"
"I was lucky to get a reservation the day of, so it was meant to be! Â The food was so creatively prepared and delicious. Â Kudos to the chefs!We tried so many dishes, and none disappointed. Â The goat wasn't even gamey. Â I definitely want to come back again during my stay in Chicago."
"This is not a restaurant, it's an experience. Typical lively West Loop/Randolph atmosphere and crowd. We started with the trout. This was hands down the best trout I've had ever. It melted in our mouths. Great flavor and textures of food. All the dishes are tapas. Next, we had the crispy short ribs. These were excellent. We followed that with the infamous Pig Face. As much as everyone seems to love this popular dish, I have to say that it was a bit much for me. It's pieces of the pig's face (pretty fatty) with a sunny side egg and maple. Next up was a pork shank. This was very good, but by the time it came around, I was all pigged out. Finally, we finished off with the pork bellies. This actually was a scrumptious dish. But, more than anything else, I will go there for the trout alone. We didn't have the goat, but there are plenty of goat choices."
"Came to Chicago for a food conference and of course had to try this place because of Â so much hype I have heard.I made reservations for Monday night and I was lucky to get a spot.Even for a Monday night , this place was packed.So here was our dinner menu-1) Roasted cauliflower- yummy, very tasty2) Grilled baby octopus- Â tender and flavorful3)crisped bake pork shank - must order .... truly a must.4) goat empanadas- very flavorful and at least must have a goat if you are here5) kohlrabi salad- so delicious, well balance flavor, love the fennel6) Hamachi crudo- succulent and fatty - just what I want.I had a cocktail and wine and my coworker, had two cocktails which were very tasty.Service was fast and very friendly. Ambiance was hip and enjoyable.Definitely a must place for dinner when in Chicago.I will come back here again for sure and bring my suppliers here so I can try the other dishes."
"Like some of the other reviewers, I too have debated whether to give Girl & the Goat five stars. The first time we went, the meal we had was literally a transformative experience -- one of the best meals we've ever had. The last two times, while still good, weren't up to the same transformative standard. Do be sure to get a lot of dishes to share, and don't forget to order one of the breads! The baking is spectacular. Still one of the best in the city and worth a trip. If you can't get a reservation (and it might take you a few months) or are just in town as a tourist, go to Little Goat across the street. It's REALLY REALLY good, Stephanie Izard is also the chef there, and it doesn't require reservations."
"Great small plates and drink selection. I would recommend the goat empanadas - they were incredible.However, I was disappointed that we were given a 1.5 hour timeframe for our meal. That was the first time I've been given a time limit at a restaurant."
"I love this place! When I lived in Chicago we frequented it at any chance we could get (and our wallets could take!). Some advice - be sure to make a reservation a few months in advance, and also know that the timing will be limited. We usually opted for a 10:00pm reservation. Pro-tip: ASK FOR THE CHEF'S TABLE! It will not disappoint. We loved sitting there and asking those in the kitchen what they were making. It's such a fun experience.The price is right on for the quality of the ingredients. We always end up ordering entirely too much food...but how can you not when the menu is so good? Definitely cannot go wrong with anything. My absolute favorite is the pork shank and the peppers. Phenomenal service and wine selection. Go check it out if you're a foodie :)"
"I had a very enjoyable dinner. I would recommend the pork face, confit goat belly, and mt. lassen trout. The sauteed string beans is a very generous portion and it was very filling. beet salad was also very good. Ended the night with miso-butterscotch budino - loved the candied pineapple."
"I had absolutely no idea what to expect from ""Girl and the Goat."" Â Luckily for me, my sister was able to score us reservations in celebration of my birthday and I was able to see for myself. With well over 3000 reviews, I am sure I do not need to add another. Â I, however, enjoyed my meal so much that I feel compelled to write one.Our server was fantastic and indicated that we should order about two dishes per person. We ordered: grilled baby octopus (with guanciale, romano beans, brussels leaves, pistachios and lemon vinaigrette); seared diver scallops (with ginger-chili aioli, shiitake, sea beans and braised peanuts); ham frites (which were like fries with ham dust, served with smoked tomato aioli and cheddar beer sauce); and crispy beef short ribs (with avocado and grapefruit chermoula).We left very full and very happy. Every single thing was incredibly deliciousâ¼!"
Girl and The Goat is an outstanding establishment. Quality service and quality takes on signature goat dishes which will send your taste buds on a Heavenly goose chase.
"I've found this to be common with restaurants in this area but the seats are so close to one another due to the size of the restaurant that it is impossible to have a reasonable conversation without hearing about John Doe and his awful job the seat next to you.That said, the food is great and unique. The portion sizes are not the best but for the quality you get I recommend this restaurant as a great way to celebrate a romantic date or special get together with friends. Wood oven roasted pig face was probably the highlight of my experience. Lots of flavor and great splurge. Great bread samples too."
"I came back to Girl and the Goat in late July, making two trips to this restaurant in two consecutive trips to Chicago. I liked it the first time around, but this second visit really knocked my socks off.Venue was great, service was great, and we were able to adjust our OpenTable reservation up to a decent hour at the last minute (we were only able to get a 9:15 a month in advance). We came with a party of four for Tristan C.'s birthday and had a wonderful meal.The drinks were nice. We had a round of cocktails then broke into a bottle of red wine. I really liked the Tagliolini, a smooth boozy drink with Cruzan aged rum, aperol, zucca, lime, and orgeat. The Bolt Action was another pleasant cocktail, with Old Forester bourbon, Blenheim's, lemon, and Angostura bitters. I forget what wine we got, but it was good.The food was excellent across the board. We had a handful of dishes I loved on my first visit in 2012: the pan-fried shishito peppers, the ham frites, the sugo, and a variation on the chickpea fritter, with ratatouille, green goddess sauce, and MontAmore cheese. Everything else was new to me. We started with the summer tom bread, which was not complimentary. It came with tomato oil and spring onion cream cheese, and I have to admit it was worth paying for. We also wolfed down the spring onion pot stickers and the goat empanadas. The pot stickers were pleasant, sweet and vegetal with ripe corn, rhubarb, dandelion greens, and sunflower seeds. The goat empanadas were a highlight of the meal, one of the best goat dishes I've come across in my admittedly limited goat-eating experience. The empanadas were crisped golden, and they came with a harmonious mix of grilled blueberries, miso-harissa aioli, and a farm veggie slaw. The goat was savory and flavorful but still quite easy to eat.We moved on to some grilled kalbi beef ribs, a fancy restaurant rendition of classic Korean barbecue, served with sweet corn coblettes and a charred okra relish. The kalbi was tender and glazed thick with sauce, and the sides were interesting and very on point. Shifting to seafood, we had some wood-fired scallops and tempura soft shell crab. The scallops were silky and supple, and they came with sugar snap peas and a bacon currant chimichurri, all in an irresistible smoked uni cream sauce. The soft shell crab was also nice, though probably the least memorable dish of the night. It came with sweet corn elote and a shallot aioli.The pan-roasted halibut might have been my favorite dish of our meal. The fish was perfectly cooked, moist and flaky and full of mild flavor. It came with Marcona almond buter, white asparagus, and a hauntingly delicious blueberry nuoc cham sauce. Dinner ended with the crisp braised pork shank, which was probably overkill. It was a huge portion of juicy pork, served with naan, buttermilk dressing, and stone fruit kimchi. It was impossible to finish, but certainly worth a strong effort.We shared two desserts, one of which was comped for Tristan's birthday, presented with a candle. The first was the bittersweet chocolate with Thai basil-chocolate chip gelato and blackberries, an excellent chocolate dessert with an unusual mix of complementary flavors. The sticky date cake was even better, a sweet, addictive, dense little cake served with blueberry preserves and a side of MontAmore gelato. I was really into that light cheesy gelato.We had a great time at Girl & the Goat, and I'd love to come back again on my next trip to Chicago. The restaurant was fun, and the food was innovative and delicious. Can't ask for much more than that."
"This time I came here with my wife (her first visit). Â I have to say that I was a bit disappointed. Â The food was all good but not nearly as good as I remember it being during my first visit.We had the following:Tomorrows Crouton - aka bread with Parmesan butter and a side of caesar dressing - decent starter Roasted Cauliflower - this was good but needed a little salt. Â I tend to like things a bit more salty than my wife but even she agreedGoat empanadas - very good. Â Lite flaky crust and awesome stuffing. Â For sure one of the best bites of the night.Scallops - the scallops were cooked perfectly and were, by themselves, very good. Â I felt the sauce/broth they were served in was a little bitter.Sugo - pappardelle noodles in a meat sauce (bolognese style). Â Very good and we'd order this again.Pig Face - this was probably the biggest disappointment between visits for me. Â I remember loving this dish, but then again on my last visit I had been well served at the bar for about 2 hours before eating! Â My wife felt it was greasy and I have to agree. Â Butterscotch Budino - this is awesome! Â I ordered it last time and it was just as good as I remember it. Â Be sure to save room!Overall, the service was good and the food was well done and good...just not great."
"Girl & the Goat was my first dining experience in Chicago, and boy did they set the bar. Now, I'll be honest, as a New Yorker I usually lower my expectations when dining outside the city. Pretentious? Perhaps. But I'm just trying to be realistic. New York City has some of the best dining in the world, it wouldn't be fair for me to go elsewhere and expect the same. My husband and I arrived, sans reservation, on a Friday night around 8:30 pm.Our First Reaction: Wow. This place is huuuugggee. You mean we don't have to dine in a restaurant where we basically are sharing the table with the couple next to us? Praise Jesus!We immediately found two cozy seats at the bar and decided to post up there for the evening. First of all, everything there on the menu is superb so you really can't go wrong. However, I have to give a shout out to the HAMACHI CRUDO. I have never experienced anything like this in my life. It's basically raw fish and bacon (to put it ever so simply) but it is delicious. I was tempted to just keep ordering the same thing over and over again.After finishing what felt like 12 courses (including booze and dessert), we got the bill and were floored at the price. Less than $150. I love you Chicago, will you marry me?Whether your Gold Standard is McDonalds or Le Cirque, you'll enjoy Girl & The Goat."
"My first and only visit was this past Sunday. I was very disappointed at the overpriced and undervalued dinner. I has the halibut which was overly salted on a mushy messy sauce, and the chick pea fritter salad which was ok, but nothing special. Dozens of falafel joints serve better chick pea fritters. My friend had the scallop entrÃ©e which consisted of TWO scallops cut into quarters! Her goat pate came with some large greasy doughy buns. The small baguette arrived with some cream cheese and pickled rhubarb for an extra charge. The chocolate dessert and the kulfi ice cream were nothing that Ben and Jerry's couldn't top. The best thing about the restaurant is the very capable wait staff. Trevor was outstanding, and extremely professional. Kudos to him, but thumbs down to the Girl and the Goat."
My first review on Yelp and I get to do it for Girl & a Goat. Omg... This place is absolutely awesome. Went in without any reservations (around 4:30) and my palate was definitely wined and dined. We started off with the honey sambal brioche and then moved on to the roasted cauliflower. yum. Then came the pan roasted halibut. That thing disappeared so quick ( and I'm not a huge seafood person). Then came the pig face. If anything... This is the one to get. Delicious! We also ended up get rack of BBQ goat ribs... Which was probably the only meh thing we ate. After stuffing ourselves... We were ready to go... UNTIL the waiter says the following... Any desert? We have this miso-butterscotch budino... And this is the best desert I have EVER eaten... So what do you do? Â You call him out in it... And the result... Dammit... He was right! Fireworks in my mouth. And I am not much of a desert guy... But that bowl was empty when I left... Cudos Girl & a Goat! Had an amazing experience. Thanks for the button.
"I got to try the Girl & the Goat the other night with the gf. I had been waiting 2 months after I made my reservation. However the afternoon of heading to Girl & the Goat, I found out that I was being laid off. Â Heading into the night I was a bit bummed. However my experience at Girl & the Goat helped my mood.I won't go into a long winded review. I will just list the food that I think is a must have / try:-Goat belly- pig face ( my fav tied with)-pork shank (just super amazing)- ny strip tartare- bittersweet chocolate- and if it's the season the pumpkin bread.Amazing place. A must try."
"In our first trip to chicago, i depended on yelp to guide us where to eat.Luckily we were able to snag a reservation at the girl & the goat...and even luckier to eat here for a second time during our short trip (granted they were really early and really late...IT WAS WORTH IT 100%xinfinity).Let me just say girl and the goat has made top 3 meals in my lifetime, and I've tried a good amount of places. From 3 michelin stars, to delicious ma and pops---I would fly to chicago just to eat here. Hell ya PIG FACE! Hell ya GOAT! Hell ya EVERYTHING! try it and you won't be disappointed."
"The almost 3000 reviews do NOT lie. Whenever I asked anyone for recommendations in Chicago, this was the place that came up. I was def NOT disappointed! As you must know, it's tapas style and here's what I ordered:1) Duck tongue (tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, piri piri): tasted exotic but I liked it! I've had duck tongue before and this dish was cooked perfectly. Flavors worked very well together2) Confit goat belly (bourbon butter, lobster & crab, fennel): my least favorite dish. Maybe I just don't have the palette for it, but the bourbon taste was too overwhelming for me.3) Wood oven roasted pig face (sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple, potato stix): This was def the most interesting dish we ordered. I've never had pig face before and although I won't rave about it, I think there is a dish worth trying for all those food adventurers out there!4) Roasted cauliflower (pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint): This was my favorite dish! I am a huge fan of cauliflower and I'm glad this dish was larger than the rest with lots and lots of cauliflower! I def hogged the plate.Ordered a beer on tap. They have a HUGE selection of beers and wines. We planned to get here late to avoid the dinner rush but even getting there around 10:30 still meant at least a 40 minute wait. Good thing we were able to snag 2 seats at the bar! The same menu is served there so why wait? Perfect for 2 people! Lots of space to eat and drink. The bartender was very attentive and made sure to always check up on us and refill our water. We were glad to try 4 of their popular dishes. Although we weren't STUFFED, it was a great meal! Took a bus and walked in the snow to get here, but it was worth it!PS. Their logo of the goat is the cutest thing ever!"
"When Fulton Market might be known as the Chicago Street of fine dining, Randolph St can be considered the hip one. Girl & the Goat is no super fine dining by any means but it's also not the cheapest, and on any given night this place is brimming with crowds and activity. Girl & the Goat has met much success, enough to open additional spawns like Little Goat nearby. We definitely enjoyed our time here in the hip not-too-cheap not-too-expensive restaurant scene.Menu is divided by veggies, seafood, and meats. Figure on buying 2 or 3 plates per person. It's weird because nothing in the menu particularly screamed out at me. It was if I wanted everything and nothing. Most of our picks were based on recommendations.-=-Best Bread and Butter ever-=- We're just starting our meal and already the bread and butter is freaking good. It's your basic onion bread but it came with 2 spreads. Â I didn't care much for the Pepper Chutney, but the tarragon butter omg. That butter spreads so nicely and has a smooth hint of greenery freshness, Dude, what a way to start.-=-Scallops in Curry Sauce-=- This looked more like a stew, but it was good. All the crunchy on top made it fun to eat.-=-Braised Beef Tongue-=- Looks like salad with a few slices of meat on it, with the meat being a crisp beef tongue. Really I preferred the scallops more to this.-=-Shishito Peppers-=- So much parmesan cheese on this, and it made it so good. There was so many peppers in there that maybe 4 or 5 could have enjoyed this plate together. Good filler if you just need substance.-=-Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face-=- The most hyped dish and with an equally alluring name, but you can just consider this like cabeza. For those wondering, there's no actual face looking at you. That dinky egg on top hid an equally dinky piece of meat below. It was still good, but not worthy as the grand finale to this meal. You still need to get one though."
"This is as good as it gets. Â Yeah we had to wait, it's a popular place! Â Luckily, the bar staff were simply incredible and kept us properly imbibed while we waited (it was actually a comfortable wait). Â We ended up grabbing a seat at the bar when one opened up because they were to awesome. Â The food is phenomenal. Â No other way to put that. Â I had the oysters (some of the best), shishito peppers (perfect), and Â then.... the bread. Â I don't know how anyone could make BREAD as good as they do. Â Needless to say, we will be back (again and again and again)"
"We had quite the trek coming from the W Chicago City Center. About mid-way through our walk over, it started dumping buckets of rain. Storm of the century!!! Not a cab or Uber could be found so we continued walking. Our clothes and shoes were completely soaked through!Once we made it in and had some wine and amazing food, we felt a ton better! Every dish completely wowed us except the kalbi which was just average. It lacked a bit of char and smokey flavor but it was tender and had the right flavors. We also tried some absolutely fantastic bread that came with a corn relish. The breads here are a must!I wished I lived next door to this place so I could try every item on the menu over and over again.chickpea frittertomatillo-tomato jam . green goddess . montamorewood oven roasted pig facesunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stixgrilled kalbi beef ribssweet corn coblettes . charred okra relishgoat empanadashuacatay . grilled mushroom giardiniera . queso fresco"
"I've been wanting to get this place for years and was not disappointed. Â Everything we tasted was delicious. Â Our waiter - Trevor, spectacular!He is knowledgeably hands off!, allowing you the customer to enjoy the experience. Â Chicago take note!Satya"
"I finally got to try this place while on a business trip to Chicago. Since I was traveling alone, I was able to grab a seat at the bar and avoid the long wait. In typical fashion, I asked the bartender for a recommendation and he suggested mini portions of the sautÃ©ed green beans, hamachi crudo and goat empanadas. Everything was delicious, but surprisingly the green beans were my favorite (who would've thought?!) I'm not sure I would wait 3 months for a reservation, but I would definitely try to sneak a bar seat again!"
"Girl and the Goat might be one of the few oft-mentioned restaurants that truly lives up to the hype. It is the complete package for a fancy dinner and worth every pretty penny. Getting here takes some advanced planning- takes a while to get reservations and you must order the goat leg in advance. Bring at least 6 people so you can enjoy the goat leg and some other small dishes.The decor is gorgeous, Â with lots of espresso wood and brick and high ceilings. Â The food. The food! Favorite small plates- pig face, Â green beans (how do they taste that good!?), broccoli, and scallops. Delicious but couldn't beat out the others: squash blossoms and peppers. But the goat leg! Â On a wooden board with an array of the fluffiest flatbread, Â sliced eggs, fried onion, dipping sauces, Â and the most tender tasty meat on a leg ever. Oh my goat. This is a must. This ranks as one of my favorite meals of all time. I wish I had the budget to do this a lot. It was pricey but everyone left stuffed and there was even goat left over to take home. If you are in Chicago this place is not to be missed for a special night out."
"Bright side:I got the goat burger and also a lot of stares. The burger consisted of a beef patty, a pile of braised goat, shredded goat bbq, bacon, onion, and peppers wedged between 2 buns. It was at least 10"" tall. And it was delicious. I packed half of it and ate it as soon as I got home. Downside:The server was slow at refilling our waters. The bloody mary I got was not good.i"
"Really liked this place, although I will admit I was a bit scared about a menu item called pig face. Our table service was great, even after a bit of a dismissive attitude with front desk folks. Plates came a nice pace allowing us to enjoy the entire evening and not feel rushed. Delicious food - loved the ham frites and the halibut. While there were some families there, it seems to be a much better place for an older crowd as it's quite loud, but not out of control. Â I'll be back!"
"I LOVE this place from the Shishito peppers to the Pig Face this is my go to Nice restaurant ""when chipotle won't cut it"". Â It has 4K reviews so it's defiantly not my little secret. Hard part is getting a reservation but everything I am there we set up the next couple while in the restaurant"
"Ate there a few months ago. Didn't need a reservation -- a friend and I just walked in one night and were immediately seated. The dishes were generally good, though I wasn't taken aback by the quality of the food. I enjoyed my meal, but I think my feelings about the place are best portrayed by the fact that I don't really remember what I had there. I recall eating the honey brioche, which was decent. I had the Duck Tongues, which were both interesting and delicious. I also had the Loup de Mer with mustard seeds, which I didn't care very much for. I'm not sure what the other dishes were -- I remember having some goat, which was good, as expected, but not so good that I remember the particularities of it. No dish stands out in memory as particularly amazing or commensurate with the hype this restaurant generally gets.I think my ambivalence about Girl & the Goat can be explained by the fact that much of the menu (when I was there) had a subtle citrus-theme to it. I was told that this theme was a subtle inspiration from Mexican cuisine -- I don't know if that's true or not. In any case, I'm generally not too keen on citrus-type flavors at dinner, so maybe that explains why I was not as blown away as everyone else."
"Not only is the food amazing the ambience is really fun. Â Special enough to book way in advance to celebrate something special, but also casual enough to go any time (of course if you can get in!) Â We took my older son here when he graduated HS and every single dish was LOVED by us all. Â And the breads are amazing too!"
"So lucky to have snagged a reservation here! (Or actually, my bf did for mu birthday). In case you are wondering, they dont do anything special for birthdays, but they will add a candle to whatever dessert you order.The waitress recommend we order 2-3 items per person for a full meal, since everything is tapas style. However, id disagree. The two of us would have been plenty full for about 3 dishes between the two of us. We ordered the green bean casserole bread to start, delicious! There was cheese and mushroom baked in, with great sour cream and green bean tapenade sides. The two of us ate the entire loaf, uh oh.Then we got the goat liver mousse with crumpets. They are generous with the crumpets. Everything was delicious, but there was serious carb overload by this point. We only ate one crumpet each and saved the rest to take home.Highly recommended to us by friends were the chickpea fritters. I wasn't a fan. This was probably my least favorite.dish. it pretty much tasted like fried mashed potatoes.The pig face is a must order. It was my favorite of the night. So delicious with just the right fat to meat ratio. The egg and potato hash went really well together with the meat.By this point, we were stuffed.. but had still ordered a pork shank. It was huge. It was OK, but can't compare to the pig face at all. The portion for this was huge!!To top it off, we ordered the caramel budino. Yum yum, highly recommend!I suggest coming with a larger group so you can try more.items. everything is delicious!!!"
"Stephanie Izzard and GATG do it again! Time after time the scene, ambience, smells, attractive crowd, drinks, and most importantly the star: the food are so incredibly overwhelming, they are a constant reminder reservations are booked months in advance. I've eaten here just twice before the heyday of the 3 month reservation wait, then I had to leave it up to finding a seat at the bar. Our first encounter was a party of 10 at technically the chefs table in front of the kitchen. Because it was a birthday party, we had a great time. I fell in love with the goat as it's my protein of choice; given that I am Pakistani and we essentially have nailed how to make goat. Izzard is one of the best chefs in America. Stop by for lunch make reservations if you know you are visiting Chicago months in advance and you will never be disappointed."
"I went to this place last Wednesday... the original plan was to go to Au Cheval but the wait was way too long. Myself and my friend from New York made our way to Girl & the Goat. We all shared numerous plates. I ordered the soft shell crab, grilled chicken, and the octopus salad. Everything was pretty good except the soft shell crab. There was only one crab in the plate and the different tastes didn't seem to match so much. The price is bit on the higher side, which I'm not too sure why the portions are VERY small. You're paying for the location and vibes."
"Overall experience: My partner and I enjoyed this joint enough that we went twice in one week. It's bit on the noisy side even for a weekday dinner. The food is on point and has unique flavors. The plates are novel ideas on crowd pleasing standards. For example we all like a cinnabon every now again when no one's looking. Here you can eat one without shame (or with it if you're into that kind of joy reducing eating) because they are quality made and hit the spot. Their take on the cinnabon is called Ooey Gooey CinnabunThe bad(ish): Nothing bad for me so far. Only maybe that they don't give me an extra stomach when I walk in so I can enjoy more food. It is on the louder side even during the weekday. If you're on a date I recommend the smaller 2 person booths instead the 4 person table, or a seat at the bar-like seating in the dinning room. It will be more intimate. If you have a group, grab a booth but don't expect to hear the person diagonal from you without some work.The good/great: I'll keep this short. It's quality food, done right, and offers unique flavors on foods you already like. Like kimchi (or want to try it)? Like pancakes? You're in luck: Kimchee Pancakes. Same idea goes for their cocktails.Keep in mind/More good stuff: Mostly a 20-30's yuppie crowd as standard in the west loop. Still family friendly. There's a dairy free menu for all you lactose intolerant (milk hater!). They're allergy friendly and will often ask."
"Since there are already so many reviews, I'll keep this short and simple. To be completely honest with myself, I thought this place was a bit overhyped. Everything was good, but none of the dishes blew my mind except the halibut. I'd totally do the pork shank over the pig face. Goat empanadas were a bit too small for me. Peanut butter butter bread I thought wasn't too tasty but filling. Bread wasn't super aromatic/fresh/buttery or anything and the butter I thought could have more peanut flavor and I didn't like the grape bits. It was a little salty. Bill came out to $100 with tip and tax and I thought I had better meals with this price point. However, this place is by no means bad. It's good still, but don't go expecting to have a revelation about food."
Service is def a 2-3I have been to many places in my short life Â and I must say I get that you are busy- but the fact that you act like I'm an invisible wall?! Please I'm wearing red lipstick and am ready to goFood is a 5 But service at the bar a 2. Bartender could care less about a tab close than filling ordersServer?! You're cool but you could give less of a shit because we're a party of twoManager? You should have comped the first drinks but you just got us the bill something that didn't need your attnDisappoint
"Really enjoyed ourselves. Absolutely great food! Squash blossoms - crab rangoon style, superbCalamari bruschetta - perfectly cookedChickpea fritters - piping hot and tastyGoat belly confit - tender Pig face - make sure to mix with maple sauce. So goodAll the flavors worked well. Food was wonderfully executed. Â Cocktails were tasty. The thai one on smelled like thai food :) service was fantastic! Â Our waiter was on point. Â Bus crew was swift. No complaints out of me! Will be back for more"
"One of the best restaurants I've been to! Complex flavors and unexpected ingredients in every dish, and they all worked magically together! Went there on 4/18/15 with 4 girlfriends. My friend booked 4 months in advance and could only get a 9:30pm seating. But, it was well worth the wait! We each ordered 2 dishes to start, which would have made 10 total. By the 7th dish, we were stuffed and they allowed us to cancel the last two! I ordered the crispy duck tongues. It was the first time I saw duck tongues in a non-Chinese restaurant. I was worried my girlfriends might not like it.... It was so good that we devoured it! Actually there was not a single dish we didn't like. The server was extremely friendly as well."
"My first experience with this restaurant was 5 months ago when I was told of this restaurant while here for work. I was curious and intrigued with the concept and quality of the food. I left satisfied and wanted more and look forward to my next visit. I went again a few weeks after and came out equally satisfied. Fast forward 5 months and my 3rd visit to this restaurant was less than what I had hoped for. I came with 4 colleagues who had heard my praises regarding this place. We didn't have a reservation but with luck, we were able to score an outside table instantly. We were seated and ready to enjoy another great meal. But that was not what we were in store for. It started with a very rude and unenjoyable server. His bad language and his lack of patience towards my colleagues was unacceptable. The food was not up to its usual standard. We ordered 11 items from Pigs Face, Pork Shank, Kalbi, soft shell crab, a nice assortment of dishes. No absolute stand out like before. I notice they have updated several seasonal dishes and the staple did not have that uniqueness that had drawn me the last 2 visits. The managers where less than helpful when pointing out our less than desirable server. How times have changed from great food and great servers to ok food to poor service. There are better restaurants with better Â food and service in Chicago. It's time has gone and pass for this restaurant."
"An amazing experience across the board. The service was great. We never had an empty glass, the server's recommendations were perfect and everyone was friendly. The meal timed out well with items coming as they were fired. I tried the local vodka to our server's recommendation and it was great. For food we enjoyed the halibut and spare ribs, both of which were fantastic. We enjoyed the chickpea fritters and pretzel. Dessert was the sticky date cake and butterscotch. Both were good, but the butterscotch was truly amazing.I'd recommend this place hands down to anyone looking for a great meal in Chicago. The price was reasonable considering the value of the experience. The place was packed, even right before close, which created a fun atmosphere, too. Do yourself a favor and check this place out."
"This place lived up to every expectation I have ever had after constantly hearing rumors about this place. Our waiter, Gary, so friendly!Ambience: warm, welcoming and somewhat country-chic. appetizer: started with oysters with a bit of aioli on them. They were my least favorite but an awesome starter. Octopus. Holy moly! Mouth-gasm!side dish: cauliflower. omg. I am such a veggie lover and these were like nothing I've ever had. Who knew cauliflower with peppers and mint could be so tasty?Dinner: goat belly with lobster and crab and duck breast. Dessert: whatever the last one on the menu was. By this time I was so high on the food I can't even remember what it was called.We already made a reservation to return on 4 months. Bravo, Stephanie!"
"My wife was a little remiss to try and eat any animal's face or stomach, but there were still plenty of delicious sounding options. And everything we got was indeed delectable.It's difficult to get a reservation here at a decent time and then they were running behind when we got there so it took a while to get seated. But once we were at our table the waitress was attentive and the food was out quickly."
"Hype....upscale....hipster....yes to all of these descriptors! Â  But the food! Â Wow! Â About 15 line chefs and more in the back dance to the tune of some great symphony to produce some of the most amazing and unique dishes ever. Â The pig's face (really hipster: bacon and eggs) is a MUST! Â The broccoli: Â do not leave this place without ordering this huge plate of heaven-food! Â The copper river salmon was a bit small but delicious. Â We wanted to get the whole fish! Â  The wine is a bit pricey: Â do not order the ""house"" wines: they are the most expensive. Â There are some good wines, so read the list carefully. Â The butterscotch dessert was a sleeper and amazing!A 4 month wait for a reservation? Â No way, no restaurant is that good. Â Just show up 20 minutes before they open and they will fit a ""couple"" in somewhere. Â Very nice about it too. Â The service was absolutely first class!Fun, delicious and you should go......"
"Yeah, it was as advertised. Great meal from start to finish. Those chickpea fritters....,.."
"Absolutely adored this place. I went on a Tuesday night at 8pm and the place was PACKED! I put my name in for 3 and they told me an hour, so I decided to grab a drink elsewhere and come back as the bar was jam packed too. We finally sat around 9:15pm. The place is super trendy and fun, awesome place for a date or girls night out. It was super loud and noisy though, expect that, but they played some super cool 90s throwbacks, which I heard when the place finally started to die down around 10:30pm & it's totally worth the loud noise. They have an awesome wine menu and I was happily taken aback that our waitress, Danielle, knew every single bottle from top to bottom. A+ right there! She also knew the menu really well and was eager to give suggestions on what we should order and what not to order. We started out with the ham frites, which came out right away. OMG were they tasty. Loved the smoked tomato aioli sauce. We ordered way too much food for the 3 of us, but everything was delicious: pan seared scallops, pan fried shishito peppers (yum!), chickpea fritters (delicious), & pork shank (the buttermilk dressing was so good!)In a nut shell, the menu is very fun and eclectic, the food is very filling but delicious, our waitress definitely knew her stuff, ambiance is super fun and trendy. Definitely worth checking out!"
"I was honestly a little disappointed after all of the top notch reviews. My mom and I went together when we met up in Chicago for a weekend. I made reservations ahead of the trip as a highlight dinner. It was good, don't get me wrong, I just wasn't blown away. Highlights were the goat liver mousse and crumpets and the pork shank. Oysters and scallops were just okay. Wanted to try more but although the dishes are small, they are quite filling. The drinks were good as well, as they should be since we were seated almost an hour after our reservation time."
The place is great and the Pig Face is a must. The food is generally very consistent time and time again. Besides the various food options it is the type of restaurant you can make as reasonable or expensive as you wish.
"We had reservations for 6:45 and were greeted by a friendly hostess. Â We were seated quickly and got to chatting with friends that we hadn't seen in several months.We had so much amazing food! They recommend 2-3 plates per person. Â We had a party of 4 and did 8 plates. Â We were severed in this order:Honey sambal brioche - buttery and so good - also a good way for the guys of our party to fill up.Kohlrabi salad - solid, but I would probably try a different salad in the futureRoasted cauliflower - this was so well done it made me love cauliflower even moreHamachi crudo - the only down said is that I wanted more =)Grilled baby octopus - I love octopus and it was so tender and well cookedDuck tongues ** AMAZING. I want this again. You must try this!wood oven roasted pig face ** Yum! Again, I would recommend this highly!Confit goat belly - so much more that we expected with lobster and crab. So satisfying and delicious.My hubby had miso-butterscotch budino and loved it. I had a bite and thought it was great, though I was too full to eat a dessert but had coffee.It was an expensive dinner with wine, but it was so delicious. I want to find another occasion to have an excuse to go back."
One of my favorite restaurants!I have recommended it to many of my friends and they loved it!When I first went here I was little bit intimidated with some of the dishes and the ingredient that went in. Â For me I like trying new things but I was a bit scared. Â I tried it and it was honestly so amazing! We tried many different dishes in the menu since its kind of a tapas restaurants.I like this place because food is good and interesting. Â It is out of the ordinary. Lot of people go here and I like the ambiance. Not classy but more like a loud bar with really really good food! haha However I did have one friend that told me it was a little bit too salty and her and her family did not enjoy it.
"Lovely.Went on a whim with my baby cousin at 4:30pm (knowing that they wouldn't have a seat any later) and were seated right away. Â Ordered 4 dishes and each bite was absolute perfection. Â I'm not going to say what we ordered since the menu is always changing, but everything, EVERYTHING was so damn good. Â Not going to lie--I was always a little skeptical about Girl & the Goat because I was afraid that it wasn't going to live up to the hype, but it most definitely did.The service is great too--the servers are always checking up on you, seeing how the food tastes, and they're all so hipster-chic!Definitely can't wait to go back."
"Dined here on a Monday night, about 8:00 PM with three people. Â Wait was about 35 minutes, so we decided to sit right away at a community table.Ceasar salad with fried chicken was substantial, nothing special. Â My boyfriend is the burger connoisseur, he said it was good/average. Â The best part for me was the drink menu, this rounded out the experience to 4-stars. Â Service was good and atmosphere is nice. Â Good for a group night out with friends and a decent meal paired with drinks."
"The foot and drinks are stellar here! Surprisingly had the best cocktail I've had in Chicago here (the one with cardamom and chamomile syrup)! The worst thing about this place is the wait, but if you can elbow in at the bar or make a reservation then you're golden!"
"Fun place, but rough around the edges--------------------So our group of 6 decided to come for dinner after hearing rave reviews. Very busy place to be sure. No ability to add an extra person to our reservations. We got an extensive, wide spread, from all 3 columns of their menu - V(egetarian), F(ish), M(eat). I'm not going to bore you with each and every dish we got (14 I think), so I will condense the highs and lows.Highs1. James Beard award2. Some dishes were hits. The pork empanada was one of the most delicious on the menu. So was the roasted green bean. The pork cheek was deliciously tender, and topped with a perfect sunny side up egg. The pork shank was again perfectly crisped on the outside, and fall-off-the-bone tender on the inside. 3. No automatic tip on a party of 6. Which is good because other places slip that in - and then have another tip line for unsuspecting patrons. Low1. Didn't turn AC on. Sounds weird given the outside temperature was in the 40's, but don't forget they have multiple sources of heat-generation - ovens, lights, human beings. It was uncomfortably stifling when you put all three together. Â Your clothes smell like food afterwards, which is not the case at other upscale restaurants (see capital grille)2. The olive appetizer has pits. I repeat, they still have pits! Â Yes it's partially my fault for not checking, but examining my food under a microscope is not the first thing that comes to mind when I'm having a conversation with my dinner mates. The lukewarm response from the waitress (oh yeah, they have pits. You ok?) was a classic WTF moment. 3. The ?busboy pouring water spilled all over the table. Accidents happen, but it didn't help that he was speeding through the pour (so my part of the table was partly soaked)65 bucks per person before tip."
6 month waiting period? Are you sure?Walked in. 90 min waiting? Are you sure? Ok. We'll sit at the bar for now. Sat at the bar and we got called to a table within 30 minutes. Wow. Maybe it's just a marketing stunt. Server/Bartender was cool. He seemed very busy. The female that was up there with him seemed much friendlier. The guy didn't smile once. He looked like we were wasting his time. Food here is ok. It's too greasy/heavy/rich for me. They do have a great alcohol/wine selection though! I'm not sure if I would come back.
"This review is about a month old, but I still felt the need to send my voice out into the vast expanse that is everyone expressing how much they love Girl and the Goat. I'll just say: It was everything I never expected it to be. The first time I ever went to G&tG was actually in summer of 2011, with a foodie friend visiting from out of town. I'm ashamed to confess I was barely conscious and severely hungover, and more or less merely a begrudging local companion to my visiting buddy. It didn't help that everything said friend wanted to order was of the heavy, greasy and beefy variety, which is a strict no-no for post-alcohol recovery-mode Irene. Fast forward to last month, when Boyfriend and I flew out to Chicago so we could check out my old grad-school stomping grounds. I wasn't terribly enthusiastic about getting out to G&tG, given the notoriously long waits (we were going for Sunday dinner, too) and my general dislike for traveling to locales west of the river and not on the Red line. The night threatened to start off badly, especially after we got to the restaurant, and a real asshat at the bar was hogging two empty seats, claiming he was saving them for a friend -- two hours later, when we left, those chairs stayed empty. But then a bright light shot through the murky night. Some couch seats opened up just then, and our waitress, a total team player, quickly ushered us into them, telling us, ""Don't mind that jerk."" We immediately started the food coming. Oh my god. The pairings. The textures. THE FLAVORS. SO MUCH FLAVORS. SO GOOD FLAVORS. The duck tongue: crispy, chewy and savory. The confit goat belly: falling-apart juicy with creamy balancing sauce. Our dessert: something I'd never heard of (apparently it was Izard's mother's recipe), but reallyreally tasty without going overboard on either the sweet nor the salt. I honestly think my favorite dish of the night was the grilled baby octopus --Â and not just because the waitress brought it to us for free to ""make up"" for the douchebag from earlier. Just the way the chewy octopus paired with the soft beans paired with the crunchy pistachios paired with the smoky guanciale paired with the dash of soy or whatever it was she used to season the dish was... genius. (For real, this is saying a lot for me, because I NEVER order octopus if I have a choice.)As we were leaving at the end of the night, boyfriend and I were seriously bemoaning not tipping MORE for our experience here."
"I can say one thing for all who dares to go here: Come here expecting you will have to wait 1-3 hours before you get seat in the restaurant or even the bar!Overall, my friend thought the food was A-OK, nothing special. But I will say in my opinion its place to take to impress all your out-town friends, which I did. Also if you don't eat pork, then more than likely the rest of food, will not impress you as it did not for my non-pork eating friend.The goat dish we got was good, which was called: Confit Goat Belly. Interesting flavors of bourbon and caramel, a bit weird at first, but I liked it!Overall, their breads are legit, and so their wine list. Friendly service, but the wait was tooo long, unless you made reservations 6 months ago!"
"I honestly don't think any phrases I can give them will do it any justice cuz they're so much better than what you would associated with ""American"" cuisine. Â All of their dishes are meant to be shared and it's just an incredibly complex set of flavors that you really have to experience for yourself. Â Their signature dish, the Pig face, is the most melt-in-your-mouth pork you will ever have mixed with the crunchy potato fries and the running egg mix together...in the words of Stewie Griffin, ""there's an orgasm in my mouth""."
"My first time here I was alone at the bar. Â How much can a girl eat? Â Well - this time I came with friends from Chicago who had never (but have wanted to) come here. Â So, we did my favorite thing EVER - we ordered almost everything on the menu. The vegetables here rock! Â The Shishito peppers - great! Cauliflower, broccoli and beets AMAZING. Â Pig face, crispy beef shank and sugo were all so delicious. Great service as well - ORDER THE bread - yeah yeah, you pay for it but it's very unique and good. Â This is by far one of my favorite spots in Chicago."
"Favorite ,we go every three or four months and i like it more every time!!!"
"Really long wait. Definitely make reservations ahead of time!The highlights of the meal:- Crispy duck tongue! The strips of fried wonton skins were a good compliment to the dish. And it was definitely well balanced w/ the poke poke.- Oven roasted pig face. Two slabs of crisped pig face sandwiching a bed of potato stix. And that sunny side up egg sitting happily on top? Just let all the flavors melt in your mouth...- Pan-fried shishito peppers. Fried well while mixing in w/ that cheese. Pretty dope. Spicy, cheesy. Yum!- The cauliflower. Wow. Fried & tossed w/ the pine nuts & pickled veggies. A nice tang w/ that crunch.- The pork shank. That meat just fell off the bone & melted in my mouth... And that bread... What a nice warm pillow... *drool*- Chocolate cake. THERE'S CRACK IN THAT BASIL ICE CREAM. Holy crap. What a nice surprise the chocolate cake dessert brings. The flavors are well balanced w/ the berries, cake & ice cream.- The blueberry & peach crumble. Buttery crumble w/ every bite of warm blueberry & peach filling.Definitely worth trying but I'm not sure if you want to wait to be ""waitlisted"" without a ressie so I highly recommend making one or going at 4:30 PM when they open..."
"I came here with my friend and my fiance as a pre-holiday dinner out together. Â The food here is ever cutting edge and top notch, you really cannot go wrong. Â I've entertained clients here before and everyone is always impressed. Â My only complaint is that the food tends to be over salted for my taste and after a couple of dishes, it feels like my taste buds are deadened from salt overload."
"I was a little apprehensive about going here - tourist attraction, overhyped, call it what you want. Â I just feared it would be a rip-off and just not worth all the chatter about it.Boy was I surprised!First of all, I secured a 6:45 reservation, day of! Â Unheard of right? Maybe I was meant to go here!It had been snowing so I cabbed it from Michigan Ave and ended up getting here 15 minutse before my reservation. Â Without knowing it, I walked up to the hostess and told her my party of 2 was here. Â She politely nodded and asked if we would want to hangout by the lounge as our reservation was not for another 15 minutes later, which was around when our table would be ready.We headed to the lounge, and I was pleasantly surprised that they had one waitress dedicated to the lounge area. Â How many times have you been in the ""waiting room"" of a restaurant only to be pissed that there was no waitstaff around?Anyhow, we started with a round of drinks, and before we were even done, the host came over, politely asked if we'd closed out our tab, and led us to our table.Initially, I was a little turned off by the table arrangement, we were between 2 other couples, but the maitre d quickly moved the table so I could shimmy-in my seat. Â Shortly after, our wonderful waitress came over, gave us many good recommendations, and the feasting began!We had: scallops, pork shank, lamb ribs, the most wonderful of salads (which I'm kicking myself for not remembering the name to), and baby octopus. Â All were delightful.We also had 3 rounds of adult beverages, that only made the food taste that much better.When the dessert menu came around, all I wanted to do was order, but my body said NO MORE. Â Sheepishly, I told the waitress I just couldn't stomach dessert, at which point she turned and smiled and said ""for being such good sports all night, I'll have the kitchen whip you up a smaller portion, on me!""Basically one of the best dining experiences of my life."
"This review is wayyyy overdue!!! Â My first time in Chicago and I am in love with this city! Our first meal in Chicago was at the Girl and the Goat. Â Usually I breakdown my meal and rate each course, but with the ever changing menu my suggestion is just to go. Just go!! The food is incredible, ask your server for suggestions. They will sound weird and creepy and you will ask yourself ""what am I going to eat here?"" but trust me...everything will be delicious! Â  Delicious! Â And afterwards you will long for the Goat, it will visit you in your dreams and if you're lucky...someday you will return."
"Phenomenal!!! Â As I always, try to find resto's that either my friends or myself haven't not been. Â Since my friend was coming from Indiana, I wanted to find some place that was easy to get to for the both of us (her being off of work and me being on foot after work). Â When I made this suggestion, he was very excited! Â After speaking with a few ppl, a reservation is needed. Â However, we decided to go early, like 430p, to see if we could be seated. Â We were.Just like the Publican, there is this long table style seating. Â It encourages the sharing of plates and stories. Â The decor is very cool. Â Love the rustic wood tables with the slightly modern/contemporary chairs.With regards to the food, I don't think you can go wrong here as there is something for everyone. Â We ordered grilled cauliflower, hamachi crudo, grilled baby octopus, pumpkin bread, ny strip tartare, and crisp braised pork shank. Â Everything was amazing!Service was amazing, I really appreciate getting us in without a reservation (as I hear they are booked for 2-3 months solid). Â I highly recommend everyone trying this place!"
"Went in to try it because of all the hype I have heard from friends. It has surpassed my expectations. Great place, great food, great staff."
"Not a lot more I can say about this place that hasn't already been said. I want to come back every time I'm in Chicago so I can eventually eat the entire menu.Came here with a coworker super late on a Tuesday (10:55, thanks for seating us guys! You da best) and the place was still bumpin. Our server was a bit miffed to have a table seated so late but she did her best not to be too pushy, not her fault the kitchen was about to close so we needed to make quick decisions.We went for meat on meat and ordered 4 meat dishes to share: crispy duck tongues, lamb tartare, lamb-stuffed calamari (we love lamb, obvs), and the seared scallops. It was all really, really fantastic. I even enjoyed the crispy duck tongues despite the presence of cilantro, which I hate. Hands-down favourite was the lamb tartare, followed closely by the lamb-stuffed calamari. How they manage to keep the calamari from getting rubbery while warming through is beyond me, but they were amazing.These 4 dishes between two people was a relatively light meal, good for a late-night dinner. If you're really hungry you might want to order another 1 or 2 dishes. I had a cocktail with gin and grapefruit that was delicious. I will be coming here for sure the next time I'm in town.Prices were reasonable for an upscale place in a major city. Not cheap by any means but I didn't think anything was exorbitant. Thank you, corporate expense account."
"Truth be told, not my kind of food (I prefer regional cuisines and this is as heterogenous as it gets). Â I give them five stars without discussing the meal -- there are countless notes available on the exciting preparations -- because this celebrated restaurant is staffed by people who are so friendly and helpful. Â From the woman who answered the phone, to the staff at the arrivals desk, the bar-person, our server: Â friendly and unpretentious. Â We felt 5-star welcomed."
"After missing out on dining here last year for my bday I was lucky to get a reservation this time around. Our experience was very positive, the tables were all occupied but it didn't feel stuffed like some places get. The decor was nice as well, it was modern without being pretentious. The lighting was dimmed but reasonably and the tables are well lit so you have no trouble seeing the menu or food as with some establishments. The staff was great, they knew the menu and did an excellent job describing and recommending from the selection.We started off with a couple breads that were nice and warm, one of which had a mushroom butter that melted wonderfully. Next we had the hamachi crudo with crispy pork belly, pan fried shishito peppers, and the kusshi oysters. The crudo was fresh and went well with the pork belly, and the peppers while not spicy had a nice smokey flavor that married perfectly with parmesan. The oysters weren't bad but I couldn't taste what it was served with, possibly due to the smokey peppers I had just eaten. Next up was the wood oven roasted pig face and the lamb ribs. I like how the pork, egg, and potato stix all come together when mixing it all up. The crunchiness, soft egg, and savory flavor made for a nice combination. The lamb ribs were very tender and moist, and the fat wasn't excessive or off-putting which can happen with some lamb rib dishes. The sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette was cooked perfectly with the perfect amount of sauce, not to mention served in a hefty portion for sharing. What I thought was excellent was the buffalo stye pork shank, it was one of the few dishes I've had that attempted to capitalize on the popularity of 'buffalo style' and successfully hit the mark. The naan was soft, sauce was flavorful and not overbearing, and the pork had the fried texture you would expect without becoming too dry. Our server was nice enough to tear the shank apart for us too for easy sharing. Our final dish was the confit goat belly with bourbon butter and lobster and crab. We liked the taste but honestly expected a larger portion. The goat belly seemed more like typical goat meat than belly, but having never had goat belly our expectations were based on pork belly. We finished things off with two desserts and two cheeses, and our server was kind enough to bring an extra dessert with a lit candle after my mom spilled the beans about it being my birthday. The cheeses were Kunik-Pasteurized Goat and Dunbarton Blue-Raw Cow, the blue was really mild with few veins. I highly recommend any of their cocktails, each of us ordered something different and they were all worthy of repeating. Apart from the difficulty of getting a reservation and the limited portions of some dishes I found Girl and the Goat to be a definite hit. If you're willing to gamble on a walk-in and have the ability of doing something else to kill the time I overheard someone with a 90 minute wait. Hey, that's better than dining at 4:45 or 10pm like I was seeing."
"Visiting Chicago from NYC, I had 2 priorities; GnG and lagunitas brewery. The Girl and the Goat completely blew away any dining perceptions or expectations I've ever had. The server, Kelly, was amazing. She knew the menu, was attentive and truly cared about our experience. The food... Well what can I say?! Â I will never enjoy eating again. I have never tasted such well balanced dishes that engage and challenge your pallet the way that they do. And the best part, is each is actually better than the last. Stephanie Izard has created something that every culinary mind dreams of and that everyone would regret if they didn't experience. Truly magnificent experience start to finish"
"Great place! We had just flown into Chicago from California with 2 kids- a 2-year-old and 6-month-old. Any parent knows that taking kids to a restaurant can be rough, but my husband really wanted to check out this restaurant and we were out of town so the kids came with. They had a lounge area that worked out great for us. We ordered the kalbi, snap green beans, chickpea fritters, and halibut. Everything was scrumptious. My 2-year-old liked the chickpea fritters and the corn that came with the kalbi. DEFINITELY recommend. We took advantage of the valet service. Parking in Chicago can be crazy so it's awesome that they have this right outside their door."
"The food is delicious, the service is impeccable, and the ambiance is great (I love the low-lighting). Â We went for my birthday and everything was perfect. Â This is also an awesome first-date place. Â Every single menu item we ordered was perfect. Â Small plates was perfect for our group of 4. The only issue was that we waited over half an hour to be seated even when we had made a reservation weeks in advance. Â There was really no apology for the wait and people who came in after us were seated before us. Â Also it is INCREDIBLY LOUD. Â The room has high ceilings and I imagine some areas of the restaurant are louder than others, but we were in a booth along the wall and it was almost impossible to hear each other across the table. Â Which was especially upsetting since my dad doesn't have the best hearing in the world.."
"Lives up to the hype. Â There are a ton of things on the menu and we ordered 9. Â I can't name all 9 but there are some dishes that are worth remembering. Â Scallops, pig face, goat poutine, beef tongue over fried chip and the quail.Do make sure to try and get reservations because this place gets packed."
"The food here was amazing and I was able to get in by sitting at the bar. The bar tender knew what she was talking about when I asked for her recommendations! Everything I had there was delicious and would love to go back and have some more--I would actually go back for the bartender as well, she was hotttt! Can I give her 5 stars as well?"
"Oh boy...was this place amazing or what! Don't be intimidated by ""pig face"" or other weird names. You just have to jump into it and eat! Be sure to make reservations in advance. I heard they re pretty hard to get. Anyway..the food was delicious. I could not find one thing that I could complain about for the dishes. I went a while back but if I'm ever in Chicago I would go again. I remember the cauliflower tasted amazing and the flavors for the dishes were superb. Be sure to also get the pork belly and goat neck."
"This was our second visit and it was outstanding. We sat at the hot captain seats. From our server on everyone was delightful. All our dishes were unique and flavorful. Presentation was excellent. My personal favorites of the night were the brioche, the shrimp dish and the rice pudding dessert. My bourbon cocktail was light and refreshing and the girl and the goat Verlot was nuanced and complimented the dishes. We made our next reservation on the way out. Chicago on a dry high 60s evening can't do better than that."
"Just like its sister restaurant, the food was good but overly hyped. It is a great place for a date night or hanging with friends."
"For starters, I managed to slide my way into a 6:15 reservation at about 3pm that afternoon, so I guess judging by these other reviews, I was either lucky or people are exaggerating how hard it is to find reservations (I guess both are entirely possible, but I am rarely lucky!)I think its important to come here with at least 3 people, because otherwise you will not really have a diverse array of choices; the dishes are varied enough that coming in a group of 2 or 3 will not really give the full array of choices needed to appreciate the dishes on this menuWith this 3 star review, (more a 3+, but not quite a 4) I want to say that it was a decent meal, but not up the standards of this price point and that it would be unlikely I recommend a return. Overall, the dishes were too heavy, and either salty or oily, lacking delicacy (which although may be somewhat a feature of the dishes and the style of food, but it is a little too much nevertheless)I'll start with the individual rating of the dishesShishito peppers: This was literally a bowl of peppers with Parmesan on top and a pool of salty miso on the bottom. I like peppers as much as the next person, and I hate to complain about large portion size. However, it became a burden at the end to have to eat our way through innumerous peppers (without some other element to break up the monotony of the dish). The peppers at the bottom were soggy and the whole dish was relatively oversalted. I would recommend this if your party is large and you want to each eat like 4 peppers, but it would be a travesty to order this if you are say out for a date night, because get ready to eat peppers.Goat Liver: literally the highlight of my night, I wanted to give a whole other star just for the sake of this dish. the mushroom, pickles and i believe it is kumquat went so amazingly with rich goat liver. My one caveat is that the bread which came with this was overly rich, and it is unnecessary to have so heavy and oily a bread to go with something already so richShort ribs: Not bad, but unremarkable. They were not quite melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the sauce was not lick my plate good. A solid dish, but not one that deserves raving.Ham frites: This is probably my fault in part for having fries ordered, but its fries with a cloyingly salty and rich ham powder sprinkled on top. Again, the dish lacks any element of lightness, or anything to counterbalance the straight oily saltinessDuck breast: this was so disappointing; the sauce was a two-bit teriyaki which tasted too sweet and could have come out of a costco frozen half duck packet. the shrimp could have saved the day if there was slightly more of it, but there was probably 3/4 of one shrimp cut into the dish. the meat itself was not badly cooked, but as was the theme of the night, was unremarkablegoat carpaccio: good dish, solid 4/5 I would say, but again, it was topped with some fried kale (If I remember correctly); fried things become a crunchy crutchgoat empanadas: I was really so unimpressed with this. it was a 14$ dish that had no distinctive feature. the goat? not poorly seasoned but had no ""wow"" factor. The dough part was similarly unimpressive. If I had been handed this empanada off a food cart, I would have been satisfied, but not from a restaurant of this stature. chickpea fritters: I was very confused about how I felt about this dish. the fritters were doughy and delicious, but they came accompanied by what seemed to be an arbitrarily complement of saladoverall, come relatively hungry; four college students could not polish off 8 dishes so at least the portion are relatively good for a ""small plate"" restaurant (but this also speaks to the heaviness)"
"Enjoyed dinner here while spending a couple of days visiting Chicago. I've eaten at a ton of restaurants that would call themselves some form of 'new american', and this is easily one of the best. The roasted pig face is a must order; definitely the highlight among a number of great dishes. We also had the confit goat belly and the escargot ravioli - both were extremely creative, complex and well executed dishes that we thoroughly enjoyed. Often I'm let down by the desserts at restaurants like this, but the miso-butterscotch budino was nothing short of spectacular. Will absolutely look to return here next time I'm in Chicago."
"The food was incredible.We sat outside at a communal table in front. Tuesday night 1030. Still packed. When it was super awesome. And the only thing bad about this place is how loud it is inside. But that's the atmosphere you pay for. Still, one of the best restaurants in the city"
"The drinks are terrific. Â Love the bar area. Â The food, last time I went, was overly heavy on aoli and pork belly-I found the entire menu pretty heavy."
"Good - but honesty nothing too memorable for me. Â Small plate style so be prepared for that. A lot of the dishes tasted like the same succotash over and over. Pretty place, Cute for a date but you will also be very close to other diners"
The dark and gourdy pumpkin rum cocktail their serving right now is DANGEROUSLY GOOD. You could put away 3-4 of those and not notice. Pig face - DuhChick pea fritters - FAVORITE DISH Green beans - a mustBroccoli- I would pass on this againTrout - most flavorful full I ever tasted
"This place was so amazing. I understand why everyone I talked to about Chicago said I HAD TO GO THERE!Since we were being badgered about making sure we got a reservation, my friend and I got the only reservation until September- a 10:45 dinner reservation! I had forgotten that Chicago was an hour behind MI time, so I was starving to say the least!Every dish was amazing! Sadly, the best things came last, and we were so full we didn't get to fully enjoy them!"
"After hearing all the fuss, we decided that we needed to experience Girl & the Goat on our trip to Chicago. Â I was pretty pleased. Â Despite attempting to make a reservation weeks in advance, we were only able to get a table for 4:30pm. Â We ordered:- Johnny Applecheese bread - tasty, sweet, and savory. Â Served with chili-cheddar butter and malted oil. Â This is the only way to eat bread.- Roasted Pig Face - crispy, amazing fatty flavor (but it got kind of boring after a few bites; better to be shared with 4 or more people)- Wood Grilled Broccoli - the broccoli was INSANE. Â I don't even like broccoli but it's the best I've ever tasted. Â Smoky and tender. - Confit Goat Belly - did not enjoy this. Â Too rich and buttery, and they used WAY too much vanilla. Â Lobster was rough and rubbery; the whole dish was a mess.- Braised Pork Shank - incredibly juicy and tender, outside was crispy and fall-off-the-bone. Â Great presentation. Â It came with bland naan, 2 unappetizing sauces (buttermilk and spicy sauce), and their version of kimchee (not edible).We were stuffed by the time the Pork Shank came out, but indulged anyway. Â The service was amazing and spot-on. Â Our waitress was wonderfully gracious, very friendly, and enthusiastic about her work. Â She made some great recommendations. Â They also have a great beer and wine selection. Â And the interior is very cozy and rustic. Â Lots of wood and natural fixtures.My only complaint is that some of their dishes are too flavorful. Â There is too much going on and there is too much contrast within their dishes. Â There is not much subtlety and cohesion so it feels forced and chaotic. Â For example, the Braised Pork Shank on its own was wonderfully delicious and worth ordering, but everything it came with did not fit at all.Overall, I had a great experience. Â This is a great establishment and I would love to come back next time I'm in town. Â I want to try all that Girl & the Goat has to offer."
"Baaaaaah to the goat. Â  Â Condescending elitists that wasted my time.While walking by here the name sounded familiar so I pulled up some reviews. Â Walked in and looked at the menu. Â While they were not open to the public for dinner door was unlocked, I walked in and they took my reservation in person right there inside the restaurant. Â Told me that arriving early would be fine. Â So went home, got dressed and excited. Â  Â Called to move the reservation up a bit and was told that is fine, come on by. Â They rebooked to the earlier of three options. Â Cool.So we jumped on the pink line and were there in 20 minutes. Â Not only did they give our reservations away (violating a verbal contact), the jack ass that told us we would now have to wait an hour at the bar was pompous and snotty. Â  He though it was funny to fuck up our plans with a smile obviously displaying that he enjoyed it.To try to compromise we offered to shop in the area on foot and have them call us as we didn't want drinks or to hang out at the bar for an hour. Â  The snotty condescending jack ass smiled when he said ""we don't have time to call you.""In order to help others avoid this situation I'll probably book a good number of reservations where I may or may not be able to show up. Â If they don't have time to call to confirm, what will they care? Â  Future diners that get the tables I reserved, you are welcome. Â And snotty self important man turning people away with personal glee and a grin, kiss my ass bro."
"HUGE THANKS TO JAMES AT THE FRONT!!! Tried getting a reservation here for 4, but could not be accommodated at our preferred time to attend the Beyonce concert we were in town for. Luckily there is a walk-in section of the bar so we decided to try our luck.When we arrived, we were told there might be a bit of a wait to get seated. A little deflated, we could only wait as we cabbed it there.Thankfully, JAMES at the front was able to get us seated within 5 minutes of stepping into the place AND put in a special request to have our dinner rushed so we could make the concert! THANKS JAMES!! YOU ARE BEYOND AWESOME!!Alejandro was one of the busboys who was very attentive at our table with clearing dishes and especially with refilling water. Each time someone got up, there was also someone who came around and refolded your napkin, which was nice.This was a tapas style place and we ordered 11 dishes. The food was ok, but the service for us was top notch! From JAMES at the front to Alejandro helping our with our table, the service could not be beat. I would recommend this place as it has decent sized tapas for sharing for 4 and gives you the ability to try tons of things!"
"Omg. Â Can you say amazing? Â The multigrain bread is fresh, the food is delicious, especially the escargot ravioli. Â Service was top notch. Â Great for dinner with a fun crowd."
"How can you not love this place? It's perfect for both vegetarians and carnivores alike. So many options that's perfect for big groups. Â  The chickpea fritters and goat empanadas are cooked perfectly and flavorful. I normally don't eat pork but made an exception for this restaurant and tried the pig face. It was delicious. The cauliflower was decent but my friends all liked it. Desserts are all great. Forgot the names but all hit the spot. Overall, a great experience. Want to come back soon."
"the hype is REAL.my cousin was in town & we couldn't get reservations so we went in around 4:30 PM & got seated right away.the server recommended we order 2 plates per person (our party could have eaten 3 or 4 a person lol) so we ordered:roasted cauliflower chickpea fritters pan seared scallops escargot ravioli goat empanadasconfit goat bellyeverything was seriously SO DELICIOUS. even the cauliflower! who knew cauliflower could be that good? the ingredients they've chosen to place in each of the dishes complimented each other so well, it had my taste buds dancing. my tastebuds are tingling even thinking about the food. the service was terrific! our waiter was pleasant. & i liked that they changed your plate out every few dishes. man, I need to go back. *salivating*"
"I was a little hesitant and unsure about what to expect - usually with restaurants that are this hard to get in, they never live up to the hype. This was absolutely not the case with Girl and the Goat. The food was all delicious and a few courses (lamb shank, empanadas) really blew us away."
"Absolutely loved the place, we didn't make a reservation so we waited to sit by the bar area. Everything we ordered tasted amazing, I think my favorite is the chickpea fritters, fired oysters and escargot ravioli. Also ordered the pig face and goat belly because of the reviews, but they were as good as I thought it they would be. Justin the bartender also made us some amazing cocktails!!!!"
"I made my reservation about 3 months in advance and grabbed a 9:30 pm opening for my me and my boyfriend. We had our expectations very high as we've heard of Girl and the Goat for years and have recently heard good things about it from friends, family and Top Chef.We arrived at 8:30 pm, and grabbed a seat on the couch by the bar and had beer. The hour passed by fast and we were seated around 9:20 pm. We ordered (rating):(4) Grilled baby octupus-Great starter dish. The brussel leaves and lemon gave the octopus a unique flavor that surprised us. (4) Wood oven roasted pig face-The pig face melts in your mouth. It is essentially a juicy, tender piece of pork fat with an egg over it and thin potato sticks, that are long thin french fries. I think the french fries took away from the dish- made it a little bit too salty. (2) Grilled marinated pork belly-Least impressed with this dish. The pork belly was firm and thick, not chewy like expected. The flavors in this dish was not very interesting either.(3) crispy beef short ribs-Some of the short ribs were very tender while olthers were dry and overcooked.It was not a unique dish either as it is very similar to a traditional vietnamese.(5) confit goat belly-best dish of the night. Tender goat belly on top of crab! I would get this again.(5) Chocolate chip cheese gelato with sticky cake-I'm not sure if this is actually what it's called but it must've been a special because I don't see it on the menu posted online. I loved how the dessert wasn't too sweet. It was delicious.Drinks:(4) petit verdo blend-I don't know enough about wines, but I enjoyed it!Overall, I was only blown away by 2 of the 5 entrees I had the whole night. Considering the hype and the fact that this meal for two cost ~$150, not including tip, some of the food was a let down. While the actual culinary experience was only about a 3.5, the good service and ambience results in a 4-star rating."
"The only reason this doesn't get 5 stars is the cost vs. the amount of food you end up eating.There were three of us and we were told we should get 7-8 dishes and we got 7 and I went home and ate some beef jerky an hour later....And we dropped $280 in the process. That did include 5 glasses of wine ($12) and two cocktails but still, it's a lot to pay for food that doesn't fill you up. Not that I need Italian family style servings that would make Tony Soprano blush but still, it's a lot of dough to go away hungry. Though in their defense, the waiter did say we might want 8 dishes in total but we stopped at 7...Could have had an 8th. Everything was great though, the bread, broccoli (grilled!) the goat dishes, fish, pork etc. I don't think you can go wrong with the menu. Even things that sound weird like meat with grapefruit ended up being a great combination. Even if you don't think you like goat, order some goat dishes....And pork...And fish...Reservations were hard to get even for a Monday so we had to eat early and got there at 5:30...Which is sort of a good thing since I wasn't very hungry."
"Exceptional all the way around. Â Great drinks, great scene, great food."
"Surprisingly this restaurant had now seafood on their menu than pork or beef! I thought that they were known for something out of the ordinary such as pork cheeks and cow bone marrow but majority of the dishes were seafood with about 1/4 relating to meats. Be aware that all the dishes are small. Like Gerber baby food portion small. Or think of a toddler portion served on a regular size plate. If you go with 4 people, you will get one single bite out of that dish. However, order 6 or more dishes and you'll end up very full and walking out of the restaurant with a major food coma. Don't let the small portions fool you. These are very filling with enough fat and carbs to leave you feeling full until lunch the next day. Everything we tried was amazing and is one of those restaurants you have to try when you visit Chicago. It's a must for any foodies bucket list to try in this windy city. Plan on wearing stretchy pants! Reservation ahead of time is a must. Extremely busy even on weekdays."
"I start by saying that I had very very high expectations for this place by looking at the menu and at the reviews. SO, when I finally found a reservation at a decent time, like 9pm, I grabbed without thinking twice. But, honestly, I do not understand why people like this place so much... On the one hand, the dish are creative. This is why I ma not giving a 1. On the other hand, everything id sooo greasy. I mean, it is not hard to prepare tasty food if everything id fried, right??? I guess to claim to prepare good food, you should not fry everything... The dishes that I tried were the goat live mouse served with crumpet. The mousse was too strong in flavor and the crumpet of course were fried. It was impossible to eat more than a bite. Then, I tried the tongue, ok but nothing special. Then, the cheeks, very similar to the tongue. The octopus was not bad but nothing crazy. And the chickpeas fritter are so much better in Italy... I think that for a lower price, just so to Purple Pig, it is much better!!!"
"After hearing all the great things about this place, we made a reservation to eat here at 8 pm on a Thursday night, 2 hours after we arrived in the amazing Chi City.Luckily we made a reservations because this place was packed. It's sister restaurant across the street was packed as well. We were greeted with very friendly staff and seated about 10 mins after we arrived.The ambiance is on the romantic intimate side. It's dimly lit with candles on your table. Â It does get a bit loud just because of the amount of people around you. The tables are close together too. When our waiter was taking the next table's order, we couldn't squeeze in or out to use the restroom, we had to wait until he finished so we could squeeze between the limited space between each able.Our waiter nicely explained the menu to us since it was our first time dining at the Girl and the Goat. It's broken into 3 categories: m, v, f. M for meat, v for vegetables, and f for fish/seafood. Each category includes appetizers and entrees, which are not distinguished. They menus are paper menus and you can circle everything you would like to order making it simpler. They also have a small menu with their specials listed.What we ordered:1. roasted cauliflower- 2 stars. Pricey appetizer of cauliflower that was burnt. We didn't not enjoy this dish despite all the recommendations by other reviewers. But our cauliflower came out black, crisp, with not much flavor except a burnt charred taste.2. Chickpea fritters- 3 stars. The chickpea fritter was very interesting. It was perfectly fried with a light crispy exterior with the mushy chickpea inside. However, it didn't have much flavor. It was like eating deep fried battered hummus.3. Hamachi Crudo- 4 stars. fresh slices of hamachi along with some fried pork belly. This was a flavorful, fresh, and light appetizer.4. pan seared diver scallops- 4 stars. The scallops were cooked perfectly, nice smooth and silky with lots of flavor. But it was on the salty side.5. NY strip tartare- 4 stars. Overall a great appetizer. The steak was very tender and flavorful. A very simple and delicious dish with complementing textures and flavors to share and start your meal.6. Wood oven roasted pig face- 4 stars. Delicious dish. The egg was cooked perfectly and the pork was tender juicy and very flavorful.7. Crisp braised pork shank- 4 stars. Also a very delicious dish. The pork shank was very tender. The kimchee butternut squash was our favorite though, very creative with a nice crunchy texture and pickled perfectly. Artistically put together, this dish was one of the highlights of our meal.8. Johnny Applecheese bread- 5 stars. Handsdown DELICIOUS!!!!! I highly recommend this dish. We were fighting for every crumb. Perfectly baked bread with amazing flavor and soft fluffiness on the inside with a great crunchy crust. It comes with chili cheddar butter and malted oil, both were delicious. I preferred the chili cheddar butter though. Very different and unique.9. confit goat belly- 3.5 stars. We had to order a goat dish. We wanted the goat leg but they were out. So sad. So we went with the goat belly. The goat belly was delicious, but they only give you a little bit. It can be salty if eaten by itself. But it came with good size pieces of lobster and crab. But it really was like appetizer sized.Their food was good, some dishes more so on the saltier side. However, the portions are like tapas and on the pricier side. We had a party of 5 and none of us left full, but it kept us satisfied for a few hours. They also have a great list of beers and wines to choose from with average prices.Overall, we had a great experience, but we left a bit disappointed. From all the great reviews, we expected something more outstanding. I honestly felt this place was just average."
"Returned last weekend. Great food, great place again. Although I got a last minute reservation, I was seated right away. Packed as usual, but there's a reason for that."
Brilliant Cuisine. Excellent Ambiance. Great conversation with new friends as you set together at communal tables.
Great atmosphere with knowledgable staff...and the best part is the FOOD! It's all great and most of the items get changed out so you are likely to always have a chance to try something new.Only downside is that it's so popular reserving a table can be difficult to get a time that works for you and your party. But I guess that's a good sign right?
I fully enjoyed my dining experience here. The Boo Boo Baise was incredible. The bread and homemade spread app even blew us away.
"With a female Top Chef winner running the kitchen in her newly established restaurant, pressure to deliver is high, but Stephanie Izard does not disappoint. A small plates style establishment with each small plate containing a perfect array of creative flavors, and more importantly, always aesthetically arranged to be pleasing to the eye. I did not have one dish that was merely satisfactory. My favorite is the cauliflower with thinly sliced banana peppers and pine nuts.Must call ahead for reservations. Booked solid for months in advance. May get a spot at the bar after a wait."
Had a date night with my daughter .. loved the food and service .. small plates but very fulfilling .. would love to come back here again !
"My boyfriend and I recently visited Chicago. Everyone told us we need to go to Girl & the Goat. I tried making a reservation but NOTHING was available. We decided to risk it and walked in on a Saturday afternoon at 4:30 pm. We were told that it would be 1 hr 45 minute wait, so we did what we always do, and stalk people at the bar. We were able to get two seats within 30 minutes. Now I prefer sitting at the bar because you get to meet the people sitting around you, plus the bar staff is usually very friendly. This was no exception, the bar staff was superb and explained the entire menu to us. After finally narrowing down our options, we selected the pan fried shishito peppers, grilled ramp marinated shrimp, wood fired scallops, confit goat belly, and crisp braised pork shank. Yes, we over ordered! Â The dishes come out one at a time, which gives you ample time to savor each and every bite. Holly molly everything was absolutely delicious!!! Everything was cooked to perfection and practically melted in your mouth. Before we could even think about dessert, it magically appeared in front of us... on the house... The miso-butterscotch budino sounds a little weird, but the flavors work. We were beyond full, but practically licked the plate clean. Hands down one of the best meals I've ever had. I wish I lived in Chicago just to frequent this restaurant. Do yourself a favor and go!"
Having read so many positive reviews of Girl and the Goat I expected great things about this place. Well it exceeded expectations - everything was delicious and the service was immaculate. Â We made dinner reservations months in advance and actually got seated right at the chef's table near the kitchen so we had front row seats to where all the magic happens. We were told that Jay Cutler and wifey sat in the same seats..oooh...The menu is pretty straightforward and all the plates are perfect for sharing. The Roasted cauliflower and goat empanadas were so good- probably my favorites. Â The braised pork was cooked to perfection. Â We also had Bread with fig and i don't know why but we were given complimentary fries from our server. Â No complaints about that! Â The ravioli escargot was tasty as well. Even though we were stuffed we still had an appetite for dessert so we had gingerbread ice cream for dessert - yummy!! Â I can't think of anything wrong with this place. Â It's busy for a reason- because the food is AMAZING. Â Do not leave Chicago without coming here.
"This place is freaking AMAZING. I'm visiting from California and I really appreciate good food and atmosphere. We had a reservations at 9:45pm, but we have to wait 20 minutes or so since they were so busy. They knew we were getting restless of waiting so they have us complimentary champagne! I was impressed. When we were seated they even brought out a complimentary bread dish because of the wait. Their customer service is definitely on point. And the food is amazing. Try everything. Just do it."
"Amazing, innovative, and really hard to get a reservation. Just go with a group and pre-order the goat leg."
"MOUTH-WATERING food! Â Now I understand why my friends made a reservation for this restaurant so far in advance. Â The place was packed, and the ambiance so energtic that it made me real curious about the menu. Â Our attentive server welcomed us warmly and explained the concept behind the restaurant. Â The idea here as to share as many plates as possible, which is what we did. Â Let me give you my Top 5:1. Roasted cauliflower (5/5) - NEVER (!!) have I eaten cauliflower this good. Â The texture and flavor and the way it was cooked were unbelievable.2. Goat loin (5/5) - Seriously... WHO makes goat THIS great!? Â Tasted like a well-aged filet mignon.3. Pan roasted halibut (5/5) - Thinly crusted on the outside, incredibly juicy on the inside, with a hint of sweetness.4. Seared duck breast (4/5) - Duck tends to be fatty, but nope, not this one. Â Very tender, much like the goat loin. Â 5. Ham frites (4/5) - Never thought of fries as gourmet food, but the cheddar beer sauce builds a strong case.The only ""half star"" deduction I would give is that the portions are a little on the small side for my taste. Â But Girl & the Goat retains its five star rating due to its prompt service and the sheer creative approach it took with all of its offerings, especially the cauliflower and the goat loin. Â I was left very impressed. Â An unforgettable dining experience."
"Crazy hard to get a reservation on short notice unless you do a rather late time like we did (11:30PM, the last seating of the night). We got there around 9:30 to hang out at the bar and were seated around 10:30 outside, which was a plus! They've got really friendly service and they definitely make an effort to get you seated.Food was really good here. Kusshi oyster was to die for! My mom and I are fans of oysters and Girl & The Goat, despite specializing in goat.. did great on the seafood side. We also had the hamachi crudo which was AMAZING - I would definitely order this again, along with the wood fired scallops, which were so tender they almost melted in my mouth. Escargot ravioli was innovative and tasty, but don't think I would order it again.And the much hyped about pig face in all these reviews? We got it and were a bit disappointed. I tasted heavy and not quite as tender as I had expected it to be. I liked the goat shank, but wouldn't say it was to die for. Overall, I enjoyed the seafood much more than the meat courses here.Our waitress was probably one of the most informative and sweetest I've ever had! She was really attentive, checking up on us occasionally without being overbearing, making careful suggestions catered to our tastes, and she was just a really pleasant person. All in all, sharing about 5 dishes cost us a bit over $100, and we were completely stuffed by the end of the meal."
"So delicious! We were served quickly, and our waiter was charming and took the time to talk to us. Definitely order the goat empanadas. Girl and the Goat is an experience! Definitely one of the best restaurants in Chicago."
"When you have a meal at a Top Chef winner, you know that you are going to go in with a series of expectations. 1) It is going to be an awesome meal, 2) It is going to be an awesome meal, and 3) It had better be an awesome meal or else I might cry. Well, when a friend I was visiting suggested we go to ""Girl & the Goat"" I immediately thought, you couldn't get a table at Next or Alinea? Well...the thought immediately escaped me because I am a huge fan of Stephanie Izard and needless to say, it is hard to get a table at Girl & the Goat as well. We started with the raw Kushi oysters with a muscatel mignotte and shaved horseradish. While it might not sound the like the best combination or one that makes sense, it works. It work's really well. The briny flavor of the oysters was brought to life and complemented by the sweetness of the mignotte wine and the shaved horseradish brought a nice heat that toned down the briny flavor you would come to expect. Needless to say, the oyster was beautifully cleaned and shucked. I would eat this over and over again.The beet salad with the avocado creme fraiche and green beans was a nice break to the meal and the earthiness of of the beets were brought to balance with the creaminess of the avocado and toasted bread crumbs brought cohesiveness to the texture. Sweetbreads, calamari, and lamb can all scare a diner on its own. Yet, feelings of intrigue caught our eye because ask yourself, where else would you find a combination like this? It was good....it was really good. I won't even bother trying to describe it, just get it.The Pigs Face was another stellar dish and while the sunny side egg might come across as unrefined, it was rustic. It was flavorful and not one to pass up on. The crispy pork flavor and the saltiness of the egg were brought together with the sweet tamarind and the bite of cilantro.Cocktails were beautifully done and craft styled. The wine list is nothing to sneer at to, however I'd probably pass on it and stick to the good stuff!Service was stellar. From the time we arrived to the moment we left, we felt welcomed. Our server clearly knew the menu and took the time to understand what we were looking for and provided honest feedback which in turn enhanced our dining experience. Water glasses never went empty and plates were carefully cleared away. It showed not just a considerate server, but an attentive support staff.The ambiance was gorgeous and comfortable. The beautiful details and the use of light and natural pieces really made you feel as if you were at the chef's home. The noise level is a little loud, but the feeling bodes well to a celebratory dinner with friends or a romantic moment with that special date. I'm not going to lie and say it was the best meal I ever had, but it is damn up there and you can bet that the next time I am in Chicago, I will be heading to the phone and making a reservation. You'll find me there."
"It was everything I heard it was, wanted it to be, and more.First, the service was impeccable. Â We walked in quite early after driving in from the suburbs on a Saturday night (not knowing if Chicago traffic would be bad) after two months with the reservation, and the place was packed. Â The host took special note of us and said he'd fit us in a littler earlier if he could. Â We grabbed a drink from the bar and he met us there about 15 minutes later with an early table. Â He didn't have to yell out our name or anything else you'd see in a jam-packed restaurant; he came right up to us and ushered us in. Â If you've ever been a host/hostess in a large, packed place before like I have, you know that this practice is not only extremely difficult, but also really professional. Â So kudos to the host staff. Â Way to make us feel great! Â We also loved your tip about the pig's face, which I will get to in a minute.The menu can seem a bit daunting, because for me there were a lot of things on there that I had no familiarity with. Â I like to ask my wait staff for suggestions of what is popular and everyone had been talking about this pig's face. Â I imagined a head on a plate. Â It's not. Â As the host brought us to our table, we had a ""trust me"" moment over this and went for it. Â We are SO glad we did!! Â It was the BEST thing on the menu, and we had a lot of yummy stuff. Â It comes to your table with an egg on top, and the wait staff told us that you are to mix it all up as if it was a breakfast hash. Â Absolutely delicious. Â We also got:The roasted beet salad - the avocado crÃ¨me fraiche was awesomeThe chickpea fritter - this was my second favorite. Â A light, awesome and fresh saladThe goat empanadas - topped with blueberries? Â Who knew these flavors went together? Â It was outstanding and my third favorite.The crisp braised pork shank - this was my husband's favorite. Â And we decided to go with the weirdest sounding dessert on our own because everything had been so fabulous, and we went with the miso-butterscotch budino with bacon-toffee. Â WOAH. Â It was unreal. Â I've never had anything like it before!!This restaurant has everything you'd want. Â Great for foodies, a special night out, large parties, or just someone that wants to feel really, really special. Â I know this is a restaurant experience I won't soon forget. Â I will be back for more."
"I will admit that I was a little skeptical that Girl & the Goat might be overrated, given how much I've heard about it in my time in Chicago. Furthermore, as a vegetarian, one often misses out on the dishes places like these are known for.However, the restaurant did not disappoint at all. Our waiter was friendly and charming, and recommended a variety of dishes given the dietary restrictions so I didn't feel restricted at all. I can't remember the exact dishes we ordered (the excellent wine might have contributed to that), but everything was delicious and full of different flavours. I found myself loving innovative dishes I wouldn't normally have thought I would (given the ingredients), and literally every dish was enjoyable.Our table was so stuffed after that we (almost) didn't have room for dessert, which also did not disappoint."
"So I always think it is tough for a joint when they become famous and people start hearing about it. The standards are raised one notch and through all the hype it becomes difficult to manage. I will not lie in that I had major hopes for this restaurant as we even made reservations a month in advance. We were able to snag a 8:30 PM reservation for a party of six and made our way over in the freezing cold on Thursday night for dinner. The joint itself is very large and the dÃ©cor is great providing a hipster vibe and not being too pretentious. We arrived and were greeted immediately by the hostess who told us it would take a few moments for our table to be set up. After our table was set, we were brought over and our server approached us immediately. She was super sweet and was very helpful in explaining all the menu items including providing her recommendations.After perusing the menu for a bit we first decided on a few bottles of vino which is obviously always a great choice. We then started diving deep into the food and after a bit of thinking we decided to go with the honey sambal brioche, don't curry be happy, pan fried shisito peppers, roasted beets, wood grilled broccoli, chickpea fritter, Hamachi crudo, grilled baby octopus, ham frites, duck tongues, confit goat belly, sugo, and a few desserts. The breads were the first to come out and the honey sambal brioche was just solid. The honey butter was perfect with it and the bread was fluffy and delicious. The don't curry be happy bread was fine and good but nothing that really stood out in my mind. The shishito peppers were da BOMB. Yeah they were probably the best shishito peppers I have ever had with the right amount of spice complimented by the parmeasan. I could eat this dish alone for days. The roasted beet salad was surprisingly solid and I was a fan at how they brought in all the flavors together. The Broccoli was ok but personally I thought the smokiness was a bit too strong which drowned out all the other senses. The ham frites came out and these things were just killer also. Big fan of the tomato aioli sauce and the sprinkling of toppings on top was just perfect. We devoured these pretty quickly. The Hamachi crudo then came out and this sashimi paired perfectly with the pork belly. Again a well executed dish but for me nothing abnormal. The baby octopus was the next dish on the table and this dish was well executed. Delicious and the combination of flavors was perfect and the veggies were sautÃ©ed perfectly. The duck tongues were the next to join the table and obviously most of the folks at my table were a bit scared to try this... but this is pretty common dish I feel. I thoroughly enjoyed the flavors of this and the poke was the perfect pair to this dish. Again this is definitely executed well if you are able to get over the fact that you are eating tongue haha. Be adventurous yelpers!! The confit goat belly was tender and just solid all around. This is not a pretentious place where they spend hours on plating they are looking to make good quality food and they are very good in this space. This place was solid and its unfortunate that were just a few dishes that did not jive with me but the ones that killed it were absolutely delicious. Still a great place to go and it is not overhyped by any means. Definitely a spot to try"
"Made reservations about three months in advance to find a normal dinner-time table for 2 (5-7 p.m.), but it was totally worth it. I've been dying to come here as a Top Chef fan, and while I did not see Stephanie Izard in the open kitchen, that was my only disappointment of the night! We were sat promptly for our 7 p.m. reservation with a great view of the open kitchen. At one point, they may have been adding to/stoking the wood stove, and the restaurant took on a camp-firey aroma, very nice. The menu is split into veggies, fish, and meat, with another menu for breads, a wine list, beer and cocktail menu, and then the specials. Don't forget the dessert menu. That's a lotta stuff to look at! The servers call them ""sharing plates"" and recommend 3 per person, but the dishes are certainly not tapas sized and you could probably get away with 2 per person, or a meat/fish each with a veggie side to share, depending on your hunger levels. Our server Monika was happy to offer suggestions of the most popular dishes, her favorites, and answer questions about the menu. For dinner we had:-Honey Butter Brioche - fluffy, hint of sweetness, with creamy butter that had whole mustard grains blended into it, and some sort of corn relish.-Ham Frites: thin, crispy, fries served with cheddar dipping sauce. Salty and maybe like a bacon crumble almost on top. Good but I wouldn't order again from a place like this, I'll save the room and $ for something I can't get at the local diner. -Cape Cod Mussels in a garlic sauce: HUGE mussels, and I my fiance and I are originally from Boston, so we are incredibly picky about the Midwestern seafood we encounter. I could actually taste the ocean on these mussels! Great taste of home! Plus came with a grilled crostini, and I love grilled bread with dipping sauce. -Pig Face: of course, signature dish. No head or identifiable facial features, just slices of tender, fatty meat with a yolky fried egg on top, and potato stix. Yea, the thin little crisps you used to buy in a can 4/$1. So good. -Goat belly confit: served with lobster and crab; the buttery, springy lobster meat, the flaky crab, and the melt-in-your-mouth goat belly were a delicious bite. Surf and turf win! Add a hard cider and a couple of beers, and the bill was just under $100, not bad for that amount of quality food and drink. I really wish we had room for dessert, because it looked amazing (butterscotch budino or a citrus pavlova would have been my choices, I'll be back) but we were too stuffed. Great food, will be back! (In several months when we can get a table!!)"
"In response to my previous review, the manager at Girl and the Goat contacted me almost immediately and invited my fiancÃ© and I back for a 2nd chance dinner - and they did not disappoint! Â Alyssa, the general manager, made sure we were taken care of from the time we arrived until our dinner was complete. We opted for a tasting-style menu again. This time, the pacing, flavor combinations, and portion sizes were perfect!Highlights of the meal included the fried oysters, the scallops, and the vegetables - yes, the vegetables! I really never knew green beans or cauliflower could be so delicious but they really were! Without a doubt we will be repeat customers after the VIP experience we were provided last weekend."
Truly epic food and fairly reasonable considering the quality; believe the hype!
"Loved it here!I went by myself about 20 minutes after they opened and was surprised to see that the restaurant was already half full . Â I had the pork face dish and it was just: tender, juicy, and so intense on flavor! I also had the escargot ravioli and it was also to die for. I like that this place lets you do half order of certain items, which really helps you save a buck. The drinks are a little pricey, but for the area, it seems about normal. The food was just so good! The bartender was very knowledgeable and was able to answer any questions about items I didn't know, as well as able to suggest his favorites to me, too. I had their honey brioche bread which was so flavorful with the butter that came with it. I also had the goat carpaccio and it was downright delicious! How can you go wrong with smoked roe, fresh olives and raw goat, as well as capers? It was a pleasant experience and i can't wait to go back with friends soon.I recommend come early, if you are coming in a large group, and expect to get about 2-3 dishes, since they are recommended that many as the size is sharing portions."
"My two favorite things here have been the crispy beef short ribs, the buckle for dessert when they have it and the goat liver mousse, which comes with about 5 piping hot biscuits, so it's pretty filling. I also liked the pig face, although it is RICH. The trout was also amazing, and basically all of the vegetables are awesome too. It's great to come to a place like this that's inventive yet approachable, and I truly feel like I can't go wrong with anything I order."
"Sitting with two of my great friends, serendipitously brought together in beautiful Chicago, on a gorgeous 75 degree summer evening, sharing an amazing meal outside as the sun set. I couldn't have planned a better evening if I tried.The inside of the building was cacophonous, dark, and from my relaxed outside perspective quite a shit show. If the weather permits I highly suggest the al fresco option.Our service was fantastic, once our spot opened it was expeditiously cleared and we were seated in a snap.The food and drinks were absolutely fantastic. The Pig's Face, Sugo(meat sauce) with Pappardelle, Goat Empanadas, and the ethereal Brioche bread were so amazingly out of this world. Even the Miso-Butterscotch Budino was complex and richly satisfying. The Ham Fries were the only thing that weren't completely demolished. This was easily the second best dining experience we had in Chicago. An absolute must try!"
"This was my first time at girl & the goat and holy crap it was amazing. Â I honestly ate so much and so well that I was full till the next afternoon. Every course we has was perfect and out waitress was wonderful. I love the look of the restaurant. It was gorgeous and open but not overly noisy. We were treated so well and never waited for anything. The best moment of service came when a dish we had ordered turned out to have oranges in it. My friend was allergic to oranges. The waitress brought a separate dish on the house for my friend to enjoy. I cannot stress how amazing this dining experience was. I'm looking forward to going again. Yes, it's pricey, but it's not something you're going to eat every week."
"Don't come here if you're plan A was Au Cheval but they're too busy and will be a long wait. Cause girl and the goat has WAY less portions and WAY more expensive. If your plan was to get a really good burger and walk out full from Au Cheval then just wait in line and don't bother with this place.BUTTT they have great food here and fantastic service, little portions and you gotta buy many plates to satisfy your hunger. 5 of us hungry dudes had to order 15 plates and our bill was 300ish dollars plus tip. Not complaining but well over what you'd pay for/ and well under what you'd get from Au Cheval."
"Absolutely incredible. Heard about this place while visiting from NYC and was lucky enough to grab a reservation (even though it was art 4:45 on a Sunday). Every dish was absolutely rock solid, and each complimented each other with such a different variety of taste. Best part is - there are so many more I would love to go back and try!Server recommends 4-5 dishes for 2 ppl, which ended up being the perfect amount. Amazing service, perfectly timing the food on the table so there is never too much at once. We ordered:Hamachi Crudo with crispy pork bellyChickpea frittersPig faceCrispy Short RibsGoat EmpanadaWill most definitely be going back next time I am in the city."
G & G. Was so good! Â This is a late review a friend and I were there 2 or so years ago but the experience was so good I still remember how amazing the food was.
"The waiter was right. You can't go wrong with anything you order at this restaurant. It's all very good! I tried the wood roasted pig face, goat liver mousse (more rich/heavy on the liver flavor than other places I've had liver mousse), chickpea fritters, wood fired scallops, and the NY strip tartare (my fav among the dishes). Loved the interior of the restaurant - very cozy and earthy. We were able to grab a picnic table outdoors and enjoy the beautiful summer weather in Chicago!"
"This is probably going to be the longest review I've ever written. Cliff's notes at the bottom. We visited G&TG twice in a four-day trip to Chicago recently after the first meal was one of the best meals of our lives from a food, service and atmosphere perspective. The only reservation they had available for our entire trip was at 10:45pm on Friday. We get there and our table is the best in the house, looking right into the kitchen. The cooks talked to us throughout our whole meal and were an entertainment act in their own right. First we ordered the goat empanadas with a Harissa aioli, grilled blueberries and a summer slaw. Then we got goat cheese and sweet corn dumplings with tzatziki, eggplant, peach and sungold tomatoes. Then the most popular item on the menu: the wood oven roasted pig's face with sunny side up egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple sauce and potato sticks. Our waitress sent us over a free order of sautÃ©ed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews. We order a half portion of dessert, which was bittersweet chocolate cake with some macerated raspberries and basil gelato. Waitress sends us an order of her favorite dessert: butterscotch pudding with sautÃ©ed apples, whipped cream and cocoa powdered cashews. Everything was phenomenal. So naturally we had to come back two nights later. On our second trip, we ordered the fried duck tongues with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, and piri piri chilis. Next, we got the pan roasted halibut with almond butter, white asparagus and blueberries. Then the wood grilled broccoli with smoky bleu cheese and spiced rice krispies on top. Next, the roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts and mint. Then the confit goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster, crab, and fennel. We finished it up with an order of the peach and blueberry crumble with a honey graham cake and goat cheese gelato. Cliff's notes: Everything we ate the entire time was phenomenal. Our favorites were the goat empanadas, the pig's face, the duck tongues, and the peach/blueberry crumble. I wish I could eat here every day. Giving this place a five-star review makes me want to go back through my old five-star reviews and make them all four-star reviews."
THIS PLACE IS SPECIAL.This is one of those places where literally everything on the menu is fantastic. Â Don't bother looking at Yelp reviews to figure out what to get. Â Look at the menu and choose based on what looks good to you. Â You won't go wrong.
"This place is booked up for 3 months for a reason. They have the most unique and amazing dishes in Chicago. I have had everything on the menu and the pig face is my favorite. They only serve craft beer that is mostly international. The dishes are a little pricey but the quality of food is worth it. This food will change your life and is the type of place you bring your wife for your anniversary. But you can also come here a get booth seating and get something fast if you are craving their vegetable, meat or fish menu. West Chicago is the place to be right now and the girl and the goat is a main attraction."
"Girl & The Goat (G&tG) is more than just a restaurant. Â Since its opening a few years ago, it's turned into one of the top gastronomic destinations in Chicago. Â Chef Stephanie Izard has tourists and locals alike eating out of her hand.Knowing all this, I was thrilled when I was able to snag reservations for 2 at 6:30pm on a Sunday evening. Â We arrived ~20 minutes early, and the hostess directed us to the bar, where we sipped on cocktails until our table was ready.I had the ""Longest Summer"" (Beefeater gin, Breckenridge bitters, cherry liqueur, lemon), while my friend tried the ""Unknowing"" (Bombay gin, George Dickel rye, malort, amaro, lillet). Â Both packed a very strong punch but were also super flavorful and refreshing on a warm summer evening.Once our table was ready, we (and our cocktails) migrated over to the dining room and browsed the menu. Â Literally every single item sounded to-die-for, but we found a nice combination of plates to share. Â The food at G&tG is served tapas-style, which was ideal for people like me, who love to taste and share.We shared 6 different plates, which ended up being the perfect amount of food for 2 seriously hungry people:(1) Pan-fried shishito peppers with parmesan, sesame, and miso(2) Duck tongue with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, and piri-piri(3) Grilled baby octopus with guanciale, fava beans, pistachio, and lemon vinaigrette(4) Escargot ravioli with bacon and tamarind-miso sauce(5) Oven-roasted pig face with sunny-side-up egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple glaze, and potato sticks(6) Miso-butterscotch budino with bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashewsI can't even begin to describe how amazing these dishes were. Â Every single one was rich and comforting and packed with flavor (but never greasy or heavy, despite all the pork everywhere). Â Special props go out to the duck tongue, which paired with the wontons perfectly. Â I also swooned over the escargot ravioli, which had a gorgeously silky texture, and the pig face, which took the concept of ""umami"" to a whole new and stratospheric level. Somewhere in the midst of all this food, we also ordered another round of cocktails. Â I had the modified version of the ""Best of Three"" (gin, Pimm's #1, cucumber, lime), while my friend had the ""Taglioni"" (Cruzan rum, Aperol, zucca, lime, orgeat). Â These were both outstanding, and really attested to the top-notch mixology program at G&tG.Service was top-notch. Â Our server was friendly, prompt, and knew the menu inside and out. Â I appreciated his forthrightness about the pros and cons of various dishes, rather than the usual ""It's all great!"" that I get from most servers.G&tG deserves all of its accolades. Â Chef Izard has created a world-class restaurant right here, and I can't wait to be back!"
"My favorite place in the city. Roasted cauliflower, grilled baby octopus, and the bread stick buns are unbelievably delicious. Service is also fantastic and very helpful when trying to decide on what to order. Worth the price and wait."
"How could I not? Â Recommendations from friends, 4.5 stars and 3000+ reviews? Â Ok, I was sold.I was only in Chicago for less than 24 hours. Â I landed at O'Hare and taxi'ed straight (yes, with my luggage) over to the restaurant to get there before the kitchen closed at 11 on Sunday night. Â I ordered the shishito peppers, pig face and the kunik cheese. Â Yes, all for me. Â The shishito peppers were tasty but a bit oily for my liking. Â Pig face, I see what the hype is about. Â Despite staring at Yelp for days before this dinner, I had no idea what to expect. Â Delicious fatty pieces of pork gets mixed with potato stix and egg, yum! Â The kunik is a goat cheese, but not extremely pungent and extremely creamy.Overall, great meal."
"Hands down one of the best meals of my life.We turned up not fully aware of the crazy hype surrounding this place. We almost left as there was a huge wait for tables, but the hostess got us on a communal table outside.The food is utterly unique. Impossible to pin down geographically, there are such interesting combinations of elements and flavors. You basically can't go wrong. I seriously considered eating every meal here during my short stay in Chicago."
"By far one of the most amazing dinners in Chicago I've ever had. Â I went with 2 others and we decided to order a bunch of stuff. Â My favorites were the duck tongue, pig face, and 'dem sautÃ©ed green beans was damn good! Â We also tried the wood grilled broccoli, chickpea fritter, squash blossom rangoon, grilled baby octopus, escargot ravioli, and goat belly. Â Everything was really delicious. Â For dessert we shared the corn kulfi and miso butterscotch budino. Â Service was great and ambiance is really cool. Â My favorite thing about this place is the food - all the unique flavors and different texture in each of her dishes. Â It's truly an experience everyone should try."
"Last night I enjoyed some really great food and drinks at girl and the goat. Everything was excellent... First time and I tried the Sauteed Green Beans ~fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews. I'm not a green bean kinda gal but YOU must try them. I couldn't get enough. Best green beans I've ever had. SERIOUSLY!!! So I'm thinking... Pigs Face, I don't know! The egg sunny side up, ugh! I'm not big on eggs either, especially one that isn't fried . Once again, fooled! It was delicious. So if your reading this review, try the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face ~sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, Â and potato stix. Next up....Crisp Braised Pork Shank~butternut squash-shiitake kimchee, buttermilk dressing, naan. Just ok! Good, but just ok. I was stuffed but had to end with dessert.....Miso-Butterscotch Budino~bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, candied cashews. Let me just say, I wanted to lick the bowl. lol AWESOME!!! Great food, great staff, great cocktails, great, great, great!!!"
"It's amazing. Her vegetables are ridiculously good and I am the person who doesn't like vegetables at all. Â Almost have had everything on the menu and only have had one or two things that aren't AMAZING. Â Which means those two things are still pretty good, they just can't stand up to the others. Â Worth the wait to get in!"
"Best meal that I had while in Chicago. Â My friend is a huuge foodie/yelper and was super excited to try this place - she talked it up BIG time, and I was not disappointed. Â We got extremely lucky with the wait as we did not have reservations for our group of 3, but someone cancelled last minute and our wait ended up being only about 15 minutes (though I would highly suggest reservations!)I don't remember the ins and outs of everything we ordered exactly, but their menu is broken down into veggies/fish/meat, and our game plan was basically to tackle anything out of the norm that we usually wouldn't get to eat. Â It's tapas style where each dish is small and meant to be shared by the group, I think we ordered about 6 different plates + 1 dessert, which left me quite satisfied (in addition to our bottle of wine).Of the dishes we ordered, I was extremely impressed with all of them except 1, which I thought to be mediocre. Â But really, this place exceeded my expectations. Â It's hard to nail every single dish that you're bringing out, and I thought this place did just that. Â One dish that stood out was the Escargot Ravioli - only because my friend literally nursed that plate for the entire meal because she was obsessed with the sauce (she literally licked it clean and we had to tell the waiter we weren't finished about 4 times). Â My 2 favorites of the night were the Goat Belly and the Pig Face. The goat belly definitely had a lot lobster and crab than I was expecting, which was a nice surprise, and the butter tied everything together so nicely - it was a perfect blend. Â The pig face was one of the more unique dishes (not that everything here isn't already unique!), but it was a cool presentation and super tasty, definitely recommend! Â Last but not least - the budino. Â I had never had budino before, and boy was this a good first one to have. Â I was tempted to order a 2nd helping. Every single bite of it was delicious, and now my mouth is starting to water. Â Get it, you will not be disappointed."
"Well, it took a while, by we finally got to Girl and the Goat. My wife surprised me by securing a reservation for my birthday at the last minute. Yes! We arrived at 430pm, the only reservation they had available and the place was already starting to get crowded. We were immediately ushered to our table and had the menu explained to us. Within about 20-30 minutes, the place was full. If you're not familiar, the menu consists of a variety of small portions. They recommend 2-3 per person and then everyone share. I highly recommend discussing your options with your server, since some parings may not go together. Our first options were, accordingly to our server, a bit ""heavy,"" so we made minor modifications. The cocktail list, although basic, is comprehensive. Drinks were served promptly and the service, overall, was great. We opted for the chickpea fritter (average), goat carpaccio (nice, but needed a bit more acid), escargot ravioli, pig face, and the crispy pork shank. We finished with the thai basil ice cream - honestly, some of the best ice cream I've had. Overall, I was happy with the meal and the service. I'm not going to give it 5 stars since I personally thought the food, overall, needed a bit more flavor. I won't go as far as to say it was bland, it just needed a bit more."
Must try the confit goat belly !!! My girlfriend said she had a food orgasm when she had it so I had to try it when I was in Chicago. She was right! Yummy !!! It's an unforgettable dish !
"Went into this meal with a great deal of anticipation and hype. I'm a big Top Chef fan, and all my Chicago friends had rave reviews for the Girl and the Goat. I will say all my expectations were met, and then some. We came on a 4:30 reservation, which we had made 2.5 months in advance. Yeesh. But was it worth the trouble? Yes, it was. Our party of 4 decided to try a number of different dishes:- Summer Tom Bread: Right amount of chew and density, and the tomato oil was delicious- Blue Point Oysters: Came with bacon and horseradish, just the right consistency- Squash Blossom Rangoons: Stuffed with crab, and had a great crispy and creamy texture, without being too greasy- Shishito Peppers: Spicy, but the parmesan had a nice cooling effect. - Roasted Cauliflower: I thought the mint would be too over-powering, but the pickled peppers had a really good acidic balance and thought the the pine nuts added a good amount of texture- Goat Empanadas: Goat was just the right texture and not too dry. The slaw it came with was great and provided a creamy texture that was just right- Pan Roasted Halibut: One of my favorite dishes of the meal. The almond butter, soy, and mushrooms had a very unique flavor and texture that I had never tasted before.- Confit Goat Belly: Delicious, and slightly leaner than pork belly.- Wood Roasted Pig Face: My favorite dish. Pork cheeks were amazing, the potato sticks created a crispy texture, and the egg on top just made everything better.Dessert:- Miso Butterscotch Budino: I'm a big chocolate aficionado, but this was great. The creaminess and candied cashews were just unreal.- Bittersweet Chocolate Brownie with Basil Ice Cream: One of the more unique desserts I've ever had. The basil wasn't too overpowering and went well with the bittersweet chocolate.Service was great with recommendations, and the waiters were like ninjas with the water. While the large painting on the wall was a bit harrowing, the decor, overall, was very simple and I always really like the open kitchen concept.Overall, I would definitely recommend this if you can get a reservation, which doesn't really need to be said with all the reviews on here, but just putting that out there. I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago, if I remember to plan ahead."
"I really wanted to be blown away. We made reservations a month out and we were ridiculously excited. We've been to a few Boka Group restaurants and have become huge fans... unfortunately this wasn't the same experience. Turns out all the hype, is just hype. Our reservation was for 8:45, Friday. Understandably for such a large busy place we weren't seated till a little after 9, thats no big deal - i totally understand people linger and order drinks, and aren't rushing out of a place they put a reservation into a month prior. We ordered the Honey Bread, Green Beans, Cauliflower, and Pork Belly to share. The Honey Bread was good - the butter it came with was great. Bread is bread, I don't think too many restaurants have bread you'd complain about. The Green Beans in Fish Sauce Aioli were good too. They were cooked perfectly, the sauce was alright, but felt a little one note. The Pork Belly came out next and was the biggest disappointment. I've had pork belly at other places that melts in your mouth and tastes like heaven. or unicorn meat. or whatever luxurious experience you can imagine. This was like chewing on rubber bands that sat on a grill. The taste was entirely fat and grill. There was no magic moment, of ""holy crap this is the best thing i ever had"" The sauce that came with it had zero flavor - The only thing that broke away from the taste of rubbery grill was the blood oranges. Then came the cauliflower. After hardly eating the Pork Belly I was looking forward to a flavor other than ""seasoned heavily with grill."" Â The cauliflower was more of the same. It tasted just like the grill flavor of the pork belly, only this time highly salted because of the pickle mix... and salt. I'm guessing the salt brought out the grill flavor even more. We really love eating out, we love big flavors and interesting meals - but this place just really felt like it was all the same. Nothing was great, everything was average at best. I'm pretty surprised given the crowds of people and hype. If you're looking for better pork, try Beatrix. If you're looking for better food overall from the Boka Group, I would try the Boka restaurant. Everything there was phenomenal. This is one place I wouldn't go back to - not worth the wait, or the month long reservation. Sorry."
"One of the best meals I've had. The soft shell crab is the bomb. Also, get the oysters!"
"When visiting Chicago and asking people what are must visits, Girl & the Goat came highly recommended. I definitely was excited to try it and from the moment I walked in the door I had high hopes. The ambiance is just my style. Dark interior mixed with a rustic feel - thumbs up!Food wise... I don't know if it was my palette coming in but everything just tasted way too salty. I think it might of been the Cauliflower because it was WAAAYYY too salty. Overpoweringly salty. Â I couldn't really enjoy the rest of the dishes because my tongue was coated with salt. Pig face - it was ok but tasted salty as well. The actual meat had a bit of an aftertaste kick, but if you like livery types of flavor then this might be your dish. I must say the winner of the night was Crispy duck tongues - YUM. The slices of duck tongues were a treat mixed with the some of the pickled veggies. For dessert the miso-butterscotch budino was fantastic. Definitely muted my palette after such a heavy meal. I loved the bacon toffee that complimented the sweetness of the ice cream. The cashews also gave it a nice crunch!Overall experience was great. Service was great. It would probably be a place I'd tell people to try."
"Dinner with the Husband: I've been here twice. Yes, you may have heard to make reservations ahead of time. If you do that, make two reservations and then cancel one of them closer to date, or gift it with a gift card for a foodie friend. Otherwise, go in and steal a seat at the lounge-which seats up to 40 people, or go to the bar-both providing full service. They don't do wait lists, but your wait can be up to an hour. If that's the case, walk a block down to Nellcote for a drink and come back. A little fib they tell you: 'The meats take long to bring out so start off with an appetizer'. Â Not always true- even on the busiest nights. The breads are okay, I would skip the 5 dollar breads and go straight to the appetizers. Everything you get is delicious, everything you get is different, and you can't get anything you get and say 'it takes like something i've had at.......' because Stephanie Izard perfected the menu, and she continues to perfect it as it does change here and there. The cocktails are STRONG...I would settle for a glass of wine next time because it was hard to drink, and I can take strong drinks. They have a great beer list too. My favorites off the menu were the chickpea fritters, lamb ribs, goat empanadas, and goodness, honestly, don't remember everything else delicious I have ordered. Service is pleasant. The wait staff dresses casually, and they all know the menu real well, and you can definitely ask for their suggestions. More tips: -Try to get to the chef's table. You may score complimentary drinks and tastings and get the secret to how to create your own girl and the girl food at home while chatting with the chef's. -Instead of ordering everything at once, order a dish or two at a time. You may surprise yourself with how full you can get! -Eat slow and share! The dishes are not overwhelmingly huge!Go out afterwards, Randolph street is a great restaurant area! Little Goat across the street has Â a wine bar too."
"Girl & the Goat never disappoints, and Â it is a must stop for locals and visitors alike. Â The staff is friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive (special shout out to Meghan Taylor for being especially awesome). Â The wait can be long, but have one of their tasty cocktails while waiting and you will get over it.For food, the sauteed green beans are a must have. Â That fish sauce, soo good. Â The homemade breads are also not to be missed. Â Really everything on this menu is delicious, so be adventurous...have pig's face!"
"Excellent food, nice casual ambiance, great service!What else can I say which hasn't already been said? Our situation was kinda unique though, because we were sitting outside, enjoying our Goat Carpaccio and Grilled Baby Octopus, when all of a sudden, it started pouring. Freakin' unpredictable Chicago weather! Despite the fact that this place was crazy busy at this point, the staff was able to somehow accommodate us with indoor seats. We had to wait about 10 minutes, but we didn't mind.Once we sat down again, we had our Pig Face and Grilled Cauliflower, both of which were extremely tasty. The Pig Face had a wonderful texture -- a mix of crunchiness from the deep fried pork and gooeyness from the egg.They also have a good selection of beers. I would love to come back here again on my next trip to Chicago and try the rest of the menu (both food and drinks)."
"I wanted to like this place. So much. Maybe my expectations were a little off the charts because I had heard so many raves about how amazing the place is. To me? There are better places in the West Loop that you can find. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't fantastic either. Another yelper had made a comment that if you're hungry, be prepared to spend. Pros: Cute ambiance, friendly staff. Our waitress (I wish I had gotten her name) was very thorough and helpful when recommending selections. Cons: I'm not opposed to dropping money on good food, but to me the food just wasn't worth what we paid. Probably wouldn't go back, but recommended if you're not too hungry and interesting in getting the whole trendy atmosphere/interesting people/place-to-be-seen experience."
"Let's review the food/experience piece by piece here:Bread - We tried the taco bread and it was fantastic. It was served with a delicious cheese spread and salsa. This was my second favorite dish of the night, and it was only $4. Pan fried shishito peppers - These were just okay. I liked them, but not enough to make them their own dish. It would be better if these were just a side that came with something else. Hamachi Crudo - Easily the least value, and least favorite dish of the night. Given that the first ingredient listed is pork belly, I expected to actually get a fair amount of pork belly along with the ""crudo"" portion, but this dish comes with ~3 tiny pieces of pork belly. It came with a few crazy thin shavings of bread, and the raw fish which was pretty bland. Goat Empanadas - These were really good. They came with healthy amount of guacamole that pairs well with the empanadas. The meat inside was tender and flavorful.Wood Fired Halibut - One of the best pieces of fish that I have ever had. Very moist and the sauce was incredible. Order this for sure if you are a fan of fish.Wood oven roasted pig face - This was good, but after all the hype and seeing thousands of pictures/reviews for it on here I thought it fell flat. It just tasted like a bacon and egg breakfast that you can get at any place in the city. Atmosphere - Looks cool on the inside, tables are super close together and it's pretty loud. Depending on the table you get, it can be hard to hear your server. The other part about sitting so close to people is you hear their conversations whether you like it or not. And the table next to us was three women fighting through their entire dinner. Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but a byproduct of cramming tables so close together."
"Amazing!! Â We had the ultimate dining experience (ate at the table in front of the kitchen) and were in awe of the service, knowledge and most of all the food! Â A must visit for foodies!"
"Top notch! Â Long overdue review from Valentines Day of this year. Â We went and put our names in, told it would be about a 40 minute wait but only ended up being 20 minutes. Â Our server was great and so was the food. Â Definitely go with the Pig Face, it's awesome!Repeat customers for sure."
Stephanie and her crew are the best! Always inventive and always fun!
"Ok - so out of all the places I tried in Chicago, this was one of my favorites. To start off, our server was very friendly and helpful in helping us choose what to order. He didn't try to up sell and told us that the 5 items we ordered would be more than enough between two people. I appreciated that. Next, the atmosphere of the place was almost very romantic and fun. You can come here on a date or with a large group. There are big tables for large groups and small tables for twos. It felt very comfortable. Now onto the food. We ordered the goat carpaccio, Kumamoto oysters, pig face, cauliflowers, grilled octopus/squids/mushroom. Everything was cooked to perfection and very flavorful and not too heavy. I can't say too much about the pig face cause .. Well.. It's pig face! I was too scared to eat it! Two thumbs up. It lives up to its hype and of all the highly rated restaurants in Chicago, if you're like me, and looking to hit up all the high rated places, I would not pass on this one."
"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday and oh was it worth making a reservation far in advance. Â The roasted pig face was AMAZING! Â I wish I had my photos uploaded on this computer so I could show how beautifully the plating was. Â The escargot ravioli, grilled marinated pork belly, confit goat belly and crisp braised pork shank were ordered as well. Â Service was quick and very friendly. Â Because I enjoyed this place so much I tried little goat and that was just as grand. Â I love chef Izard! Â Thank you so much for the wonderful experiences we will definitely be back!"
"This is definitely one of the best restaurants I have ever been to, anyway. I recommend going with a small group so you can share MORE. I went with a group of four and we tried eight or nine items. I don't even know f I could pick a favorite; everything I tasted was shockingly, extraordinarily delicious. We has the sautÃ©ed green beans, goat cheese and sweet corn dumplings, hamadi crudo, tempura soft shell crab, wood fired scallops, pan roasted halibut, wood oven roasted pig face, corn fed bread, confit goat belly, and, for desert, miso-butterscotch budino. Everything was amazing (yes, even the pig face)! We sat outside, on the sidewalk, which was nice. You need to make reservations way in advance or you can be a walk-in, but if you are doing that, I suggest you show up before they open, at least on the weekends. They have walk-in seating available outside and in their bar/lounge area."
This place rocks!! Great food and even better drinks! The manager Julio suggested an oyster appetizer for us... Omg amazing!!!! Great service and best Old Fashioned on Randolph!!! We will return with friends! If you want to impress your friends go here!!
"I admit I was a tad beside myself and believed myself the luckiest girl in the world (not really I'm exaggerating) when I got a same night reservation at relatively appropriate time for dinner. The dinner was good, and though the atmosphere was distinct, it did not correlate adequately with the price. The food was better than most I guess, especially the Pig Face. I like the concept of mostly small and medium size plates. If wasn't so overhyped, it would have been more memorable, I think. You miss out on the experience -- because the food actually was quite excellent -- by focusing too much on the reputation."
"When I was in Chicago, everyone said to try this place and I'm glad I did. I tried making reservations, but of course, they were fully booked for 2-3 weeks out so we decided to come by right when it opened at 4:30pm and got a seat at the bar. It worked perfectly and I was surprise that a lot of people were there on the dot doing the same. Our waiter/bartender was super sweet - every single one of them. We had actually been eating right before we came to this place so we weren't super hungry, but wanted to try a few dishes. We got the infamous pig face, wood fired scallop in uni sauce, oysters, and butterscotch miso budino to share. Everything was DELICIOUS - especially the pig face and budino. It was very different from anything I've eaten and I was left fascinated by the dishes and wanting more! MUST TRY IF YOU'RE IN CHICAGO!"
"We'll go back as many times as they'll let us! I can't say enough about the attention to quality in every aspect, while maintaining an inviting atmosphere that in no way feels snooty. The pork face and cauliflower were both amazing. It's tough to get reservations, but you'd be surprised how often something opens up last minute!"
"I love love love this place. Been here on three occasions. The food is fantastic, the beer list is good (and I'm a beer snob), and the cocktails are delicious. I highly recommend ordering at least one dish from each column in order to truly appreciate the culinary skills of this place."
Always great. The difficulty of gettign a reservation is finally easing.
"One of the best meals of my life! I found out about this place from a friend and when I flew to Chicago to visit my boo, I hinted (approx 58933748 times) about wanting to try out this place. We ordered 6 dishes and I almost cried from the dilemma of being overstuffed, but wanting to finish all of the delicious food. The pig face along with the sugo pappardelle pasta were my two favorites. The pig face had such great texture- crispy from the potato sticks, rich from the perfectly runny egg yolk and buttery/soft Â (I don't think it's humanly possibly to find a word to describe the meat perfection) from the roasted meat. The pappardelle pasta was extremely smooth and flavorful with the gooseberries giving it a delightful and exciting burst of fun and sweetness. I'd gladly fly from LA's 70 degree weather to Chicago's 15 degree weather for this restaurant again :)"
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! Still surprisingly hard to get a reservation, even years after it opened. The trick is to walk in around 6/6:30 in the evening. I've done this twice now and have gotten a table within 15 minutes (party of 2)."
Amazing food!
Excellent service and Â tasty cocktails. The goat empanadas served over guacamole with savory blueberries was killer. The wood fired oysters were lame...Butter not melted down. We only sampled the apps. I'll be back for dinner some day
"Had made a reservation for 3 and called a month in advance to preorder the leg of goat or what is commonly known as goat for 6. Â They literally call a select butcher and get a 8-11 lb goat leg that is prepped the day before you eat it and cooked the day you show up. Â Service was outstanding. Â My b school roommates and I had gotten together for a 17 year (holy moly getting old) reunion in chi town and this place was awesome. Â We were drunk from margaritas at frontera grill and had brought 3 bottles of shall I say outstanding personal wines to enjoy. Â We ordered countless apps and way too many sides. Â Needless to say when the goat arrived we all looked at each other like ""what are we gonna do now?"" Â It was delicious - so delicious melt in your mouth perfectly seasoned and not an ounce of gaminess to it at all. Â I do think the sauce election with it could have been more intensely flavored. Â You need some real acid to cut the richness of this meat and also could have used some heat. Â We ended up sharing the goat (and our wine) withy anyone who was willing to try . Â Trust me when I say we were the most popular guys in the restaurant. Â Great food, great service, amazing atmosphere and best of all memories with my boys....thx girl and goat you guys gotta go."
"It's outstanding. There were two of us out for dinner, and we bot seats right up at the bar overlooking the kitchen. In addition to our orders, we were treated to small samples of many other dishes hot off the stove. I of course had to try the goat belly, but I have to admit that I was not a fan of goat meat. Other than that, everything else was exceptional, including the service. Unfortunately, it will be a longtime before I go back. I don't like having to make reservations so far in advance."
"My boyfriend and I recently started binge watching Top Chef and I guess I've been living under a rock because I never knew the winner of Season 4 was the mastermind behind Girl & the Goat! Needless to say, I immediately went on OpenTable to see if they had any reservations open in the near future and luckily I was able to find a table for 2 on a Wednesday at 8:15. Not too bad considering I saw some reservations for 11:45 PM (who would even eat that late?!). When we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately at a small table, which was a little too close to our neighbors for my liking but it didn't ruin the experience at all. For drinks, my boyfriend and I decided to try some beer and wine that we've never had before, so I went with a glass of the Montepulciano/Sangiovese and being from Baltimore, he chose the Stillwater Cellar Door. They were both really great and complemented the meal well. Since I did extensive research on Yelp, I already knew what we wanted to order coming into the night and decided on the sautÃ©ed green beans, scallops, pig face, and confit goat belly. We were also going to order some oysters, but decided to nix them because I wanted to enjoy each dish without being too overly full and make it to dessert! I'm glad we made that decision because it turned out to be the perfect amount of food. The sautÃ©ed green beans came out first and they were delicious. Being Vietnamese, I loved the fish sauce vinaigrette, which was an interesting spin because it somehow did not remind me of Asian flavors. I also loved all the shallots and cashews that were in the dish and I would definitely order it again. The scallops were a little disappointing though because the dish only came with 2 and I couldn't really taste the uni in the sauce. Next came the infamous pig face, which I thought was good, but a little too fatty for my taste. My boyfriend found the texture of the pig face to be too mushy and wanted more potato stix for the crunch and contrast. Last came the goat belly, which I was a little nervous to try to be honest. I've tried some weird things before, but I've never enjoyed them because I kept reminding myself what I was eating. However, I came in with an open mind and boy was I glad I did! The goat belly turned out to be our favorite dish because the meat was tender, but crispy on the outside and leaner than the pig face which was very welcomed. The crab and lobster that it was topped off with was also a great complement and I really enjoyed the surf and turf aspect of that dish. For dessert, we shared the miso-butterscotch budino, which was the perfect end to the meal. The budino was nice and moist and I loved the candied cashews and butterscotch. My boyfriend laughed at me and asked if I was going to lick the bowl clean, but hey, can't a girl just want to scrap out the last of the butterscotch? Overall, the meal was everything I'd hoped it would be with great drinks, food, and atmosphere. After coming home, I later found out that they were celebrating Girl & the Goat's 4th birthday, which made sense since I thought the Happy Birthday banner above our table must have been leftover from a party. Hopefully I will come back soon and try other items on the menu, especially more goat dishes!"
"Friday, 8:30PM.Customer rep: Jill.Looooong wait, opted for communal seating near bar instead. Quickie: +Good food+Amiable service+Clean+Stylin' decor+Hummin' tunesAnd then...?Make reservations. If not, hope for communal seating. Girl & the Goat reppin' Chi!**********Stuffed my face in:1. Goat empanadas Â  Â  +Flaky, meat didn't overpower fried goodness2. Pot stickers Â  Â  +Unique, nice flavor profile3. Scallops Â  Â  ++Hot dang this was good - tender and savory in the right way4. Pork shank Â  Â  +Naan was buttery, soft (amazing) Â  Â  +Interesting sauces (buttermilk and kimchi puree) Â  Â  -Kimchi (lacking some punch)"
Nothing short of excellent. The Girl and the Goat is a foodie heaven. Each dish was both surprising yet perfectly balanced. I could not have asked for a better meal. The wine selection was also robust and we were easily able to find a blend which paired beautifully with our meal.
Love this place - one of the best in Chitown!!
"I've been there for dinner and it was amazing. The honey sambal brioche was superb and I also hamachi crudo. If you are an avid beergoer, then definitely check this place out. They have tons of options! Left that place with a smile on my face. Bon appetite!"
"I went here for my birthday a year ago (I know, that's a long time to wait before posting). It lived up to my expectations. Â Our server was great and the food was adventuresome and tasty."
Can't say anything more than what has been said here already. Great food and service. Poor value due to the small plates and very high prices. The servers recommend that each person order two plates each and then share with your table mates. We were a group of six and that two plate thing just didn't work. The folks at the host station were kinda rude and too business like. Yes we were 10 minutes late but I called ahead and told them. I want to feel like they're happy I'm there spending plenty of my money. My car came out of the valet with a bunch of mud on one side of it...where did they park it??Five stars for the food and service.Two stars for the value. $9 bucks for a small loaf of bread???One star for the host stand.One star for the valet.Next time I'll try the G&G Cafe across the street.
"Girl & the goat was a little overhyped but still so delicious. I wish I could've tried more things but I guess I'll just have to be back. My favorites:- PIG FACE - sooooo good, just order it! I wish I got two- Diver scallops - cooked perfectly and yummy flavors- Bittersweet chocolate - the dessert melts in your mouth and it's the perfect sweet salty mix The decor, ambiance and service are all top notch. If you can't get reservations (because you should make them at least 2-3 months in advance), you can sit at the bar and order the full menu!"
"This restaurant is sort of a must try at least once to see what all the fuss is about. I had excellent service and the cocktails were amazing. I think the flavors were great but I wasn't totally impressed overall for a ""gotta go back"". For me a once a year type of place. Randolph St. has so much to offer. I'll go back for those cocktails for sure though!"
Staff: incredibly attentive- particularly as one was a gluten free pescatarian& they didn't miss a beat- offering substitutions and alternatives.Drinks: love love love their cocktail list - we had 2 each- it is hard to decide though- arrive thirsty!!Food. Omg- even as a pescatarian- wow! The scallops are tremendous!! The meat eaters greatly enjoyed the pork cheek- so definitely try that.What didn't I like? Waiting 3 months for a reservation. But it was so worth it.
"One of my friends who is originally from Illinois recommended this place to me. I had already ready reviews on this place by then, so I was super excited to try it when I went on vacation to Chicago.The food at Girl and the Goat is amazing! Every dish had something special and you could taste all the flavors. A few of my favorites were the salmon and pig face. I normally do not enjoy salmon, but this dish was cooked to perfection! So so delicious with the tomatoes (also another item I normally do not enjoy). The pig face is excellent. It is a little fatty and very rich. I loved it and so did my friends who have never had pig face. I definitely would reccommend trying as much as you can. The plates are small, so order about 3 plates per person. The reviews do not lie, this place is worth the month in advance reservation!"
"The food: 3/5. I feel fairly ambivalent about this places. I've been twice now and the last time I've decided it's not worth my time. We had fries, scallops, trout, pig face and some kind of pork. I know everyone raves about the pig face, but I though it was just average, incredibly greasy and the only flavor and texture came from the shredded fried potatoes on top. Everything else was interesting, but nothing to write home about. The service: 3/5. The service is attentive, but not very personable. Twice now I found the hostess to have a bad attitude. Overall: 3/5. G&G is definitely #1 for the most over-hyped restaurant in the city. I'll have to try a lot of other places before thinking about coming back there."
Breakfast here was so good. The wait wasn't long and the food came quickly. The staff are very friendly and accommodating as well.
"Lives up to the hype. Best strategy: call and make reservations for months from now (you'll have to). Just pick a date. When the time approaches, find someone to go with you. It won't be hard. Interesting and memorable."
"Top chef winner Stephanie Izard's Ã¼ber popular spot is full of energy: party goers packed like sardines, friendly staff and food bursting with happy flavors!Don't expect neat presentations: everything here is relaxed and rustic. The staff know the ins and out of the menu, but sometimes hard to flag down because the place is a buzzin!! Bf made sure to book weeks in advance and we still couldn't dine until 9pm ...on a weeknight.Dishes range the gamut from healthy eats, to seafood dishes and even a classic pasta ragu, but with a twist. Every dish we had was stellar! roasted beet salad with white anchovies and avocado creme Fraiche; the kampachi crudo with pork belly; grilled octopus with guanciale and pistachios in a lemony vinaigrette. Â The surprise dish is a classic ragu piled atop tagliatelle with Rosemary and caper gooseberries -- savory, delectable to the last bite.My fave of the night was a cloud-like goat liver mousse. Light and airy, but really decadent in the mouth. I love love love the croquettes and little accoutrements, so pile it on! There wasn't any space in my belly for either booze or dessert (since we got both at the Aviary prior to coming here) but I'm pretty much sure I would've loved it as well. Five stars all around. Â I'm a happy camper!"
"Amazing. Believe the everything that you've heard!I made a reservation about a month in advance for a Sunday at 8:15. I am at loss for how you get a reservation for a Friday or a Saturday night. I tried Open Table two months in advance and nothing! So, I settled for a fancy Sunday night dinner.First- our waitress Kelly was incredible. I cannot say enough nice things about her. She was kind and patient throughout the ordering process, guiding my boyfriend and I towards what to get. She also helped us decide on drinks and dessert. She checked on us often enough to make us feel like she cared, but not too often that it was too much. My friends had highly recommended the bread. Get it. The Honey Sambal Brioche is the best bread and butter I've ever had. It's perfect to get your appetite started.The plates are small and you order all at once so they pace them out. We got the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face, Goat Empandas, Crispy Beef Short Ribs, and the Grilled Baby Octopus. And once we got everything, we went for the Goat Belly too because, hey! We're only here once (really, at those prices...yolo).I should note here that I am not a super adventurous eater, but had figured if I'm coming here, throw caution to the wind!Everything was amazing, the flavors blended together like a dream. If I had to pick one it would be the Crispy Beef Short Ribs. Everything else is amazing, but the combination of the smokey beef, and the refreshing grapefruit and avocado were to die for.We topped it off with the Miso-Butterscotch Budino. We were debating between that and the Citrus Pavolova but Kelly told us to go with the house dessert. We listened to her and then were presented with a small portion of the Pavolova on the house! Get the Budino. Oh my god, there are no words.Decor makes you feel like you're at home, not at a fancy restaurant. All in all, an amazing experience I can't wait to relive when I win the lottery!"
"Excellenet across the board. I do think it's overrated in terms of how long it takes to get a reservation. That being said, once you're there, it's great."
"Dare I say it: I don't get the hype around this place. Â The restaurant is beautiful, the menu quite adventurous but the flavors didn't deliver. Â If you are an adventurous eater and like to use terms like ""foodie"" then this place may be fore you but I will not be back."
"Too hyped up for what it is. Don't stay too long or you will leave the place smelling like pork. Very good drink selection and ambiance is very fun. Def a must go to restaurant for the experience but not a place I would go back to, again."
"During my most recent business trip to Chicago, I managed to meet with two friends who'd never been to Girl & the Goat. I was excited to share G & the G with them as I had a memorable meal last year. Turns out, this would be my best meal over the weekend, even after dining at Alinea during the same trip.This time, we weren't so lucky just walking in and getting a table. We got there around 7:30 pm and were told a table wouldn't be available until 10:30 and we'd be better off trying to find a spot in the bar & lounge area. We waited 30-45 minutes before two finally left, and the three of us nabbed their spot. I ended up not having space at the table and had to eat off my lap... Nevertheless, the food was amazing.I ordered a glass of Schloss SchÃ¶nborn 2006 Estate Riesling Kabinett, and we started off with two breads, the Gouda Bacon and Busta Rye (both $4 each), and Ham Frites ($7). I preferred the first bread over the latter, since it was served with smoked fat back butter. However, I still like last year's Peter Piper bread better and was disappointed they didn't have it this time. The ham frites is simply fries served with ham bits and smoked tomato aioli and cheddar beer sauces. Pass on that next time.For our mains to share, we got my favorite Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face ($16), Crisp Braised Pork Shank ($25), and Hamachi Crudo ($16). The most overrated was definitely the hamachi and I wouldn't order it again; it was good, especially since it was served with pork belly, but it wasn't all that special. The pig face was just as good as I remembered it, if not better; however the winner of the night was probably the pork shank. Wow. Dressed in buttermilk and served with grilled spring onion kimchee and deliciously pillow-y naan, the meat was so tender and fell right off the bones. I'm salivating just thinking about it. Definitely a must-order.As my motto is ""there's always room for dessert"", I of course, ordered dessert. Per our server's recommendation, I got the Rhubarb Shortcake, which was also amazing. Not too sweet and the ""cinnamon toast crunch"" made for a tasty contrast to the horchata tapioca.Service was satisfactory and pretty good, considering we were sitting in the lounge area. The timing between dishes was perfect for us, since we were sharing our table with others and didn't have much space (which is why I ate off my lap). The most plates we had on our side was probably three at a time, so it was very manageable.Whether you're a local or visiting from out of town, G & the G is a must-stop.Michelin: Bib Gourmand (2014)"
"Really amazing food overall with tiny portions. Â 3 people share a dish is fine. Â 4 is stretching it. Â Great: Â pig face which is great after a few drinks, goat belly, shishito peppers with parmesan, bread with miso butter and relish, miso budino dessert, lamb stuffed calamari which was really tender, roasted cauliflower with pine nutsOk: Â goat mousse was ok but it's worth ordering so you get some carbs, goat carpaccio which was beautiful with all the garnish but so thin I really couldn't taste itExcellent service and waitress paced our dinner perfectly. Â Great wine list with affordable choices. Â No wonder it's impossible to get a table here."
Top 5 meals I've ever had.
"Okay people. You really need to listen to me on this one... If you haven't visited this place ... you need to GO. Call today and make a reservation for as soon as you can, I promise you will walk away with feeling of pure happiness & maybe even in a food coma . Here was our visit: My drink of choice (or should I say what my husband chose for me because I could not decide) was Jack in Detox. It could have been shaken or stirred or whatever a little more because at the top of the drink I thought I was doing a shot every time I took a sip but once I got down a little father, it was amazing. Miso hungry - BREAD heaven! Well, maybe it wasn't just the bread - the butter - OH HOW WE LOVED THE BUTTER & apple saucish (yep, I think just made that word up) - the apple saucish stuff was delicious.. it was a cross between apple sauce and apple butter so I will go with saucish. Warm olives - Interesting and not bad at all but they are just olives, you know? Nothing really to write home about. Fried Naked Cowboy - What? Egg salad & capers on a fried oyster? Who does that? Who thinks of that? The great minds at Girl & The Goat, that's who! It was a party in my mouth.. just different levels of flavor and amazingness. Pig Face - First of all, I have to give our server props, I don't remember her name but she was awesome! That said, someone ran this to our table & our server noticed right away that the proper way to devour this delectable creation hadn't been shown to us, so she came right over & hooked us up. Every bite we took had a different flavor. Unbelievably delicious. A must try!Pork Shank - Hellllooooo beautiful! The pork literally falls off the bone and this sauce that they put on the plate with it... OH My GAWD! So delicious - the flavor is spectacular and it has a little bit of heat, perfect for the dipping of the yummy pork. So - after ALL of that, we were obviously stuffed! I really wanted to try dessert and I am so thankful I did... bittersweet chocolate - um, can I just tell you that is was the BEST dessert I EVER ate! Oh & before tip we were under $100. Yep, I said it under a hundred bucks.. A few of the best things I have ever eaten & it didn't cost a fortune. Girl & The Goat.. thank you for making me a happy foodie :)I can't wait to show my face there again and try a million different things!"
"After researching restaurants on yelp and base on my friend's suggestions, we booked a dinner here at Girl & The Goat. Â We were only able to find a late reservation online. I found out yesterday that if you just walk in, you might be able to be seated early as they reserve some seats for walk-in. Â That's good to know. Â We waited at the lounge area with drinks before being called to our table ahead of our reservation.This restaurant is located in a remote area of Chicago. It's a bit far from our hotel and there weren't much in the area. Â We had arrived early to check out the area only to find nothing around so we went inside.We ordered a couple of beer in the lounge area. Â The restaurant is indeed very popular and packed. Â Everyone seem to be having a good time with drinks, good food, and good company. Â Although big, it felt very cozy inside and I love the music playing.We were seated next to other couples. Â It was very easy to overhear other people's conversations. As others have mentioned here, the dishes are tapa style. Â The price range is not too bad as the most expensive was $25 (pork shank). Â We ordered 6 total and it came to about $100 plus tip. Â Not too bad but it does add up!We ordered a few dishes:Roasted cauliflower: This was a very hearty dish. Â Pretty good price for the amount you get. Â We were full by the time we finished. Â It had roasted cauliflower, pine nuts, mint, and jalapeno. Â The flavors were good.Koni Kampachi Crudo: Â Light and quite tasty. Â There were only 3 pieces of fried pork belly!Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: Â Not quite what you would imagine. Â This was good. Â It tasted like stewed pork belly. Â You just have to get past the idea. Â The three sauces that came with it (cilantro, tamarind, and red-wine maple) were yummy. Â The sunny-side egg was perfectly cooked and went really well with the pig face. I would recommend this dish.Crisp Braised Pork Shank: For the most part the pork was perfectly cook and tender. Â Quite tasty too. There's a few dry pieces. Â I did not like the squash shitake kimchee. Â This was our last dish. We were already full.Goat Blue Bread with fig butter and fennel onion jam: Love the fennel onion jam! Â The fig butter was good too. Wished we could get seconds. Only $4 though.Butterscotch Pudding was so yummy! Â Would have it again.I would probably come back again if they had more selections. There are so many restaurants in Chicago to try!"
"Let me tell you. The 8 pound lamb leg is no easy task and definitely enough for 8 people. Although we only ordered the side veggie dishes, they taste amazing, especially the cauliflower by far my favorite. The green beans with cashew nuts goes well with the lamb meat and brings some balance."
"What can I say that hasn't been said. The servers will definitely try to get you to order all of your food at once so they can get you in and out. Don't be rushed, enjoy your meal. Oh yeah, and get the pig face and the duck tongues. Â You won't regret either of them."
I ordered the fish plate and it was yummy! My friend ordered the special burger. Fun food. Great atmosphere .
"I spent 3 days in Chicago over the Memorial Day holiday and I had a lot of great meals, but this was by far the best.A girlfriend and I were visiting a friend from college who had moved to Chicago not too long ago. He's been here a couple of times and knew to make reservations for us on a Saturday night. We were seating almost immediately. It is quite dim and quite loud inside. I was fine with the noise because we were definitely having drinks at dinner and some inebriated bonding time. The restaurant has the feel of a fancier restaurant but also very personable and cozy. It's not pretentious and I liked that. What we ordered in the order it was served:Bacon gouda bread with butter and romesco - The bread is very tiny, only four slices, but very savory. The romesco was heavenly.Goat carpaccio, trout roe, fried capers, olive-maple vinaigrette - Loved the combination of the thinly sliced goat with the vinaigrette dressed greens and fried capers. This plate is smaller and lighter than most on the menu.Goat liver mousse, picked rhubarb, blueberry, crumpets - I loved this one even though I am not a big fan of liver. Cut the crumpets in half, spread some goat liver mousse, and top with either pickles of the blueberry spread. DE-LICIOUS.Shishito peppers, parmesean, sesame, miso - I'm a big fan of shishito peppers especially when they make it like this at restaurants. However, I thought there was a tad too much parmesan and HOOOOLY SMOKES these were hot! I feel like the really spicy ones are one in a million but I got at least 5 in this little bowl of peppers. We didn't finish half of it because my mouth was on fire and I couldn't taste anything else after.Halibut, almond butter, white asparagus & Cauliflower, pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint - These two paired very well together. Tactfully served, guys!Pork shank, spring onion kimchee, buttermilk dressing, naan - At this point, my stomach was about to pop. The pork was very tender and went well with everything else. I wish I had more room to eat a couple more bites!!It's recommended 2 plate per person. We went with 7 total because the bread and the carpaccio were on the smaller side. The three of us also shared two bottles of white wine (one very acidic one and another Greek wine I really enjoyed). Our server was great and contributed to such an enjoyable dinner atmosphere. He made it a point to get to know us and gave us spot-on recommendations!Girl & The Goat is a must try in Chicago, but don't forget to call ahead!"
Good dishes.But need reservation more than one month ahead if you want your time.
"Another great restaurant on randolph, what can i say. Listen, you need to make reservations ahead of time, i mean way ahead of time. 1 to 2 months. Â If you want to eat at a decent hour. Â My girlfriend and i went for an anniversary, the staff hooked us up with the seats right up to the kitchen. Â Watching them work was so cool and they were very friendly. They will make conversation and are totally chill if you get a chance to sit there. Â They may even five you a small free dish, jackpot.It lives up the hype, most dishes are small and you can share. Was more affordable than i thought it was going to be. Â Ill be back. Â In a month or two ;)"
"My friend and I got to the restaurant at 6pm on a Thursday night, and it was an hour wait. However, the servers also suggested waiting at the bar area because they also serve food there as well. We were able to find empty couch space and ordered our food. Our server tells us that we would need to order about 3-4 dishes for two. But we only ordered two things, as dishes are very pricey here. We started off with the hamachi. This was just ok. I thought there was too much sauce and the pork belly was too salty. And our next dish was the pig's head. It was really flavorful and I liked it. However, the party next to us did not like it at all. They claimed it was too fatty for them. They really enjoyed their green beans though."
"I really wanted to check this place out and figured with all the rave reviews of it would be busy. Then I discovered that it's the restaurant of a Top Chef winner, so thus even busier and more hype. Â Disclaimer: I ate here about a week ago and I don't recall all the dishes.First off, I went there on a Friday at 4 pm (which is when it opens) and it quickly became packed.Service: unbelievable. My rocks sized glass never went empty. Not once.Food: For two people, we ordered a salad and three meat dishes and it was the perfect amount.- Beet salad: honestly, highlight of my meal. I don't even remember what was in it but I know it was crispy, fresh, and delish! I ate here a week ago and I'm still thinking about it.- Pig's face: Served with an egg, this dish was so comforting for some reason. This was my favorite meat dish. And this was one of three that I had.- Duck breast: Served with kimchee.- Goat belly: Served with lobster, it was a delightful surprise.Ok, I don't remember the details of the dishes, they were all great. The beet salad and pig's face was by far my favorite. It was agreed that the duck breast was our least favorite (but still delicious).I'll definitely be back, update my review, and likely try Little Goat across the street (owned by the same chef)."
"Creative and unique menu items. Each dish is eclectic in flavor and absolutely stunning in presentation. Great service for a consistently slammed restaurant, don't try to go to without a reservation, but definitely go!!!"
"I made reservations 2 months in advance. Definitely wanted to try this place since it's so popular. It's Â a cute restaurant and trendy. There was three of us and we got 6 plates along with dessert.In order:1. Short rib was amazing and would definitely recommend it.2. Goat empanda was pretty good3. Bass was so savory and delicious4. Green beans, I wouldn't recommend it. It was okay.5. Pig face was also pretty good but not as great as the short rib or bass.6. Octopus was also okay.it was hard to start off really good and then end with three okay dishes. We did save some room for dessert and I'm so glad we did! We got the Miso butterscotch budino and bittersweet chocolate. The budino was recommended by the server and it was absolutely amazing. I would definitely go back just for dessert. That's how good it was!I think the food was good and the service was excellent. Going there one time is all I would have to do. I think you can enjoy and experience it once, but I probably would rather try other restaurants before I come back a second time."
"4.5 stars, but I will round it up to 5 stars! Make sure you make reservations!!Delicious! Great food, ambiance, and service!!Between 3 people, this was the perfect amount.Ordered: The dishes are served tapa styled, so it is best to order and share!1) Chickpea fritter: 5/5 Wow, amazing! Highly recommend this dish!2) Roasted cauliflower 3/5, a little disappointed; The cauliflower could have been slightly more roasted3) Wood fired scallops: 4/5 The flavors were amazing!! Uni!4) Pan roasted halibut: 3/5 Slightly disappointed b/c there was TOO much going on in this dish5) Crisp braised pork shank: 4/5 Another amazing dish6) Miso-butterscotch budino: 5/5 I am not a fan of cooked fruits, but I was pleasantly surprised how great this dessert was!"
"My favorite restaurant anywhere! My most recent visit to Chicago reminded me why I love this place so much. I wish I lived in Chicago just so I can eat here all the time. The food is amazing. Always fresh, perfectly cooked, and bursting with flavor. There's literally layers of flavor in every bite with every dish. Even if a particular dish isn't to my taste, I somehow just can't help but like it anyway. On this last visit we ordered the crispy beef short rib, scallops, brioche with honey butter, pig face, cauliflower, and pierogies. The pig face is my favorite dish of all of them, it's so rich and flavorful, with the crispy beef short ribs being a close second. But like I said, every dish here is good. I can't wait to go back to Chicago just to eat here again."
"My dining companion and I strolled in for a drink and were told that should we want a table we would need to order food. Â Fair enough, we were willing. Â When our overly aggressive waitress approached our table, she told us that they recommend getting four or five things to split among us. Â Four or five things, four or five things. Â Okay, we've got it. Â We are both college graduates. Â No need to reiterate how many items you suggest we get. Â Message heard. Â Our waitress forgot my drink, yet continued to be pushy about us ordering more. Â If you cannot handle the task you have been given, it does not instill my confidence in your ability to handle more. Â Why should I keep ordering?  We split the scallops, which I highly recommend. Â They are incredible. Â I wish we had simply ordered additional scallops instead of the duck that we did get. Â The duck was tough and the flavor was fine, but not good. Â Cue to our waitress who put my drink down on the table while facing and talking to the table next to us. Â When I finally got her attention, I ordered the cauliflower, which I have had before and enjoyed. Â The inattention of our waitress and time elapsing left us looking for her to ask for the check. Â We had assumed that after sitting there for so long, she had forgotten to put the order for our cauliflower in and at that point it was fine with us. Â We just wanted to leave the polar opposite environment of borderline hostility versus being ignored altogether. Â She displayed a poor attitude throughout the evening. Â I thought she was working for tips?The bill came and included the cauliflower, which she informed us would be coming out soon. Â She seemed to be annoyed that we asked for it to be removed from the bill since we were ready to go at that point. Â Ridiculous, I know.I would advise going for the scallops (the only reason this was not a one star review), skipping the duck, and if you're able, avoid waitresses with bad attitudes."
So overwhelmed by the food!! It is really loud but the great food makes up for it. The pig face and the pork shank were so good so good so good!!! Falls apart at the tip of the spoon and melts in your mouth!
Food wasn't as great as it was hyped up to be honestly. There are much better places to eat in the area.
Food sucks not sure why people giving 4-5 start for this location ? I am a Italian and I grow up with a restaurant owner family we use to have 6 locations in allOver the world I know what good food means
"I really wanted to love this place. It was good but maybe my expectations were too high. We booked our res 2 months in advance since we knew we'd be in the city for our annual Christmas shopping. I figured not all these people could be wrong, right?Here's what we had:Warm OlivesSourdough breadroasted beet saladbroccolisteamed west coast musselsgrilled baby octopusgoat belly confit with lobster/crabbitterseet chocolate with shitake caramel gelatoService-excellentFood-good not great."
"Still five starts for me. Â My second visit this year and still impressed. Great service, even at the bar where I sat this time. .. no reservation. ... got here at 4:30 on a Tuesday and it was a mob scene. Â Ordered the duck tongues, Â they were good! Â  It 's more of a salad, Â can't quite place what they taste like, Â but think crunchy and chewy bacon at the same time. .. would order again. Followed with the goat empanadas, Â good, but I prefer the way they were served on my first visit, Â can still taste that mustard vinaigrette, it made my tongue dance.! Â Also ordered the cauliflower, Â very good. My ""dessert"" was the Bolt Action cocktail, Blenheim and Bourbon, Â can't go wrong! Â  Let me Give them major KUDOS... for offering me half plates since I was dining alone. .. BEST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! !!!"
"Awesome and Amazing! Food, Service, Venue, and Location were all great! Â We had a private event in the upstairs room with use of outdoor terrace. Â Event coordinator and staff went above and beyond to make sure everything went well! Â Would definitely host another event here and/or stop in to eat!"
"Not much to say what hasn't been said. This is a 5 star restaurant and should be on your must visit list if you are visiting Chicago. I made my reservations when I was planning a visit to Chicago. Good thing I guess because everyone I told said ""How did you get in? Did you make them 2 months ago or something?"" Yes I did.So I ended up going solo and the waiter informed me that many of their dishes were meant for sharing. The menu had about 3 main sections, if you count meat/goat as one section, and the server recommended I go with around 3. they offered to do half portions so that I could maximize the tasting. The server was against me calling it tapas style even thought with the small plate multi-course style it essentially is.Here is what I had""Spanish Harlem Cocktail - Perfect mix of sweetness and booze I was looking for in a cocktail. I highly recommend this drink.Goat Blue - Focaccia bread with fig butter and fennel onion jam. It is as good as it sounds. I probably shouldn't have ordered this with all the other food but I saw someone else eating and had to try it.Escargot ravioli - Without knowing that this was escargot inside the ravioli I wouldn't have guessed. So if your not into more exotic food, don't worry it's safe. This was a rich and very flavorful start to my tastingPigs Head - Just like the last item, it is not as odd as it sounds. Just some really tender shredded pork at the end of the day. Very flavorful, a must get item if it is on the menu.Cauliflower - Even if you traditionally don't like Cauliflower like the waiter told me, its phenomenal. I have to put this in the category of a must get item too. Unfortunately I think everything here is outstanding.Butterscotch Miso Budino - What seems like what would be a simple dessert is still executed flawlessly. When the server told me that it came with a butterscotch candied bacon it was a game changer. The dessert was light enough where I was still able to enjoy it while being slightly full."
Awesome! Highly recommend if in Chi-town. We made reservations months in advance and the earliest we could get was 9:30!
"I'd like to start out by saying I'm a pretty picky eater... My list of foods I don't like (or won't eat) can be quite extensive. But HOLY MOLY was this dinner amazing. My husband has wanted to eat here since we moved to the city four years ago so I finally made a reservation, two months in advance, to surprise him for his birthday. Since we were there to celebrate his birthday I told him to order whatever he wanted regardless of my picky tendencies and I would eat it. We had the taco bread, pierogies, escargot ravioli, pork shank, goat empanadas and the plantain cake for dessert. This is where I say HOLY MOLY again. Everything was delicious!! The broth in the ravioli was to die for, seriously. Just writing this review has me thinking I should probably get another reservation in the books...I'd also like to add that I was a little nervous about what our final bill would be, and even after ordering six items and four drinks I was pleasantly surprised when it arrived."
Delicious but everything seems so heavy.
A legitimate culinary experience.Highlights:- Pig face- Smokey broccoli- Parmesan peppers- Old goat cocktailEmily was an excellent server and the entire staff made the experience one to remember.
"Although a little unsure or the menu at first, my family and I decided to go for it and we ordered about 8 different dishes and 2 desserts. I must say.. all of them were fabulous. Everything was cooked perfectly. We loved the combination of such different and exciting tastes. The lemongrass bread and yo qieuro taco bread were so different but a very nice start to the meal. My favorite dishes were their signature Pig Face dish and the Cauliflower. I could've been completely content with just those two but everything else we had was equally as pleasant. For dessert, we ordered the sticky date cake and chocolate truffle cake. I personally prefer the second but both were amazing! To top it off, the vibe of the restaurant is very cool and the staff was awesome also."
"Girl and the Goat called us a week ago confirming our reservation for last Saturday. We originally planned on going yesterday so we had to cancel our reservation :( (when you make the reservation 3 months in advance sometimes you mix up the day you are going). Sooo we decided hey why not just walk in! After reading other reviews we planned on waiting an hour and a half (which was also the est. wait time) so I looked up other places to grab a drink close by. There are so many!!! We went to RM Champagne Salon (so cute highly recommend!). Went back in an hour and grabbed a drink at the bar there. Not even half way in we were called! Now onto the food...I rely heavily on my fellow yelpers so I ordered what everyone recommended. Chickpea fritters, pig face, pork shank, ham frites (that's because I love French fries) and ended with the bittersweet brownie basil gelato dessert. EVERYTHING WAS AMAZING. The best was the pork shank (OMG I NEED THIS AGAIN). The dish we could have lived without was the dessert. Maybe next time go across the street to little goat and get dessert. Will be back again!"
"Try and find something to complain about here. No, I'm serious -- expose yourself for the weird, joyless crank you are.As I was traveling alone for dinner the night I visited G&tG, finding a spot at the bar on a busy Saturday night was seamless, and I floated right in.I braced myself, as I anticipated the possibility of being somewhat ignored service-wise, all by my lonesome. Bah! Mere paranoia. Service hopped right up and I was faced with a lovely, tart Aviator (the Yellow Chartreuse in this cocktail -- AFFIRMATIVE) to accompany menu perusal. I decided to go all out and really MEAL here, not just pick around, all dainty small plate-style. Oysters arrived, and they were like making out with a super hot mermaid who's really into you -- surprising (I'm always suspicious of shellfish in the Midwest), delicately oceanic, boner-inspiring.Kohlrabi salad was tender and an absolute blast to eat, followed by SCALLOP PERFECTION, Â and the NY strip tartare, which -- just, yes. Yes to succulent rich light loveliness. I cannot imagine having to share my food here with someone else. I simply will not do it. I'll stab you in the hand with a fork. Oh, and MY KINGDOM FOR THE APPLE BUCKLE WITH BROWN BUTTER GELATO.So, there ya have it. Thanks, Girl & the Goat for a ginormously fun food adventure, cute and hilarious bartenders, on-the-ball service, and superb atmosphere."
"Girl and the goat lived up to its name. Â We went with a friend for her birthday and ordered a ton of food. Â The combinations that Girl and the Goat put together is so unique. Â Our favorite dish was 1. The mussels 2. Octopus 3. The goat empanadas 4. The cheddar pierogies! Â I read other posts urging yelpers to try the pig face. Â Our table did not enjoy it. Â The meat was very fatty. Â We finished off with dessert the bittersweet chocolate! Â It was amazing! Â Overall, the Girl and the Goat was very fantastic. Â It was trendy with a amazing flare!"
"The food was great! I went with a friend and we tried 4-5 different things, all were awesome. The place was very loud and crowded though. You couldn't have a normal conversation. But I enjoyed the food A LOT!"
"Ok so yes, Girl & the Goat is delicious. I don't think it's 5 star delicious, but it's damn good! Been here a number of times and there's ALWAYS a super super long wait, which tells you that it's good! I've tried a number of items on the menu and everything is consistent. One thing I didn't love was the mac and cheese. Mac and cheese has got to be exceptional for me to rave about. If you try my sister's mac and cheese, which I grew up on, you would understand why I'm such a hard to please mac and cheese snob! Â But, back to Girl & the Goat, great place, cool rooftop and relaxed, casual atmosphere. Good service too!"
"I had a reservation for this place in LATE MAY... made back in FEBRUARY. And I would say that the wait was absolutely worth it. (I've heard from others that you can call and try to get last-minute reservations from cancellations.) Despite the fact that we were crowded in elbow-to-elbow and overhearing other patrons' snarky comments (""I am morally opposed to taking pictures of food,"" said one as I pulled out my iPhone for a quick Instagram snap), I had a very lovely experience here with my boyfriend.I verrry much enjoyed the roasted beets, especially with the extra crunchiness from the bread crumbs! The goat carpaccio was a well-balanced dish with a tinge of sweetness from the maple vinaigrette. At the recommendation of the waitress we also got the tempura-fried sugar toads (puffer fish), which were crispy as well as tender. And of COURSE everyone here on Yelp raves about the pig face (contrary to my expectations, you do not get served a pig head... I have no idea where I got that impression). The plantain cake dessert was diviiiiine, a wonderful concoction with cold and warm textures, and creamy and tart flavors.Hooray for Stephanie Izard!"
"Excellent, friendly service and menu!"
Great halibut - best dish ever! Goat out of town!!! lol. It was exceptional. Who knew green beans could provide an orgasmic experience. My hub loved the pork belly. Looking forward to that halibut dish again - must try.
"What a great dinner! My partner and I went there for our 2 year anniversary and had such a lovely dinner. The Girl and the Goat definitely exceeded our expectations!We ordered the sourdough bread (it came super hot and fresh, with a good crusty outside, chive cream cheese and tomato oil), roast beet salad, and fried pickles (try dipping it in both the sauces at the same time, sooooo good!). We also tried the escargot ravioli, which had a great earthy flavor and was wonderful non-chewy escargot, the bacon sauce for the ravioli was so delicious I could have eaten a whole bowl of it as soup. The best part was absolutely the confit goat belly! It had the most amazing bourbon butter sauce and came with lobster and crab. OMG it was super yummy! I will continue to dream about that amazing goat belly for the rest of the summer. The desserts were great, the beer list was comprehensive and had a wonderful Ommegang dubbel.To top it off, we had a great server. He was attentive without being overbearing. And at the end of the dinner there was a bit a snafu with my open-table gift certificate because I printed out the wrong thing, but the manager was super friendly and very nicely explained what I actually needed to show them, which I found on my phone. For a situation that was probably kinda annoying for them, both the server and manager handled in a kind and professional way that didn't make me feel stupid or silly for doing the wrong thing.For the price, you get a lot more (and all super delicious-and-exceeds-expectations) dinner than a lot of small-plate Chicago restaurants. I highly recommend, especially for a special occasion you are planning in advance."
"Overrated.I don't understand why there is so much hype about this place. Now that I've been there and tried it, probably wouldn't go back again. There are other places that I'd prefer in the area.The decor was nice (industrial hipster style with exposed wood and minimalist lighting) but the tables were close together and kind of dark.. Friendly staff.We had: green beans - okmussels - goodpig face - goodgoat belly - gooddessert (bittersweet chocolate shiitake-caramel gelato . toffee crÃ¨me frÃ¢iche) - interesting flavor, worth a try but wouldn't get againThis is a small plates kind of place, so would need 4-5 plates for two people. The price is comparable to similar restaurants; it was about $120 for 4 plates (free dessert for my birthday!) and 2 drinks."
"Perhaps there was too much hype for G&G but after trying a 14 dishes, I wasn't impressed enough to give it 5 stars. Â But there were some awesome plates:* Pork shank with kimchi sauce - Â The tangy kimchi sauce really made this one shine.* Fried squash blossoms - I could eat an entire plate of these babies.* Escargot ravioli - I've had escargot several times in a traditional preparation but this was the first time in a ravioli. Â The pasta was perfect.* Chickpea fritters - Unexpectedly light and airy!* Goat belly confit - You can't beat pork belly, but good nevertheless.Had I only tried the plates above, G&G would be an easy 5-stars but these plate were a bit of a letdown:* Pig Face - 3.5 stars - I was expected to love this one given the ingredients and rave reviews but it wasn't that elevated from a good breakfast once you mix it all together.* Fried duck tongues - 2.5 stars - Although an interesting protein, the tongues were just crispy bits overpowered by the black bean sauce. Â I'm sure the braised beef tongue would be better tongue dish.* Grilled octopus - 2.5 stars - Slightly tough and I didn't like the combination of grilled veggies.The desserts were just okay for me but I generally prefer sweeter ones. Â I expected the goat cheese one to be right up my alley but it was too tart and goaty for me. Â The atmosphere was classy but laid back and the service was excellent. Â The waitress made sure we didn't order too many dishes for our group."
"I asked for restaurant recommendations for my trip to Chicago and several people recommended Girl and the Goat. This spot is deserving of all the hype and rave reviews. We came with a group of 7 and probably ordered EVERYTHING on the menu and EVERYTHING was delicious. I don't remember all the dishes we ordered, but some of the ones that stood out were the goat carpaccio, the pig face (tasted like gourmet spam), the goat Â tongue (tasted like gourmet corned beef hash), and the octopus. The deserts were also bomb. Will definitely be back!"
"A fantastic restaurant with a variety of interesting and delicious food. Any time I'm near it, I consider returning. For a more extensive review, see: bakingandeating.wordpresâ¦"
"The girl and the goat has an amazing ambiance! The decor was rustic and warm. We had a little issue with the reservations the host stated we had the reservations for the following day. They corrected the issue quickly and we were seated. The girl and the goat states that the serve family style plates/tapas style in actuality one plate could be enough for one person. We had the an array of different meals, the pork shank, pig face, trout, pig belly and beef ribs. I was shocked that the pig face was not my favorite but overall the meal was filling and tasty. We spent $160 on 5 plates and two alcoholic drinks. I will definitely go back to try the goat and more of the fish options."
"This restaurant deserves 5 stars hands down. SO GOOD. Mad respect to the executive chef and Top Chef winner, Stephanie Izard. We made a reservation 2 days before, and the only time left was 11:45pm on Friday (I didn't know ahead of time how busy this place gets). We decided to walk in on Friday at around 8:50 to see if we'd have better luck. The wait was supposed to be 1 hr 45 min, so we found a seat at the bar. Decided to grab a couple light dishes to start: ham frites and chickpea fritter. Both were very good. We could tell right away this was going to be a good experience. After about 1.5hrs, we got seated. Here's what we got and the order it came out:Pan roasted halibut - amazing! Literally every ingredient just melded together and worked so well. We cleaned the plate, including the garnishes. Confit goat belly - my first time trying goat. I was hesitant because I don't like gamy meat (like lamb), and I just had this perception that goat would be way to gamy for me. But oh man, this was cooked so perfectly. If you ever want to try goat, this is the place to do it. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside. And the garnishes, again, really enhanced the dish.Pig face - this was surprisingly my least favorite of the night. Just didn't do it for me. Maybe I don't like eating fat as much as most people here on Yelp). I just can't eat fat. And pig face had a lot of fat. A lot. Crisp braised pork shank - this was also very good. Crispy on the outside. Meat just falls of the bone. Came with two sauces, kimchee, and naan. I wish it came out earlier cuz we didn't do it justice. We were so full by now we couldn't finish it. Miso-butterscotch budino - what is this and why is it so good? A lot of people were ordering this, and the waiter said it's the most popular dessert on the menu, so we tried it. Wow. So many flavors that worked so well together. Cake, butterscotch, bacon toffee, pineapple, cashew. Perfect blend of sweet, tart, and salt.I can easily say this is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to in my life. A little on the pricier side but worth it."
"Finally! I've tried to come here on numerous occasions, but due to Girl & the Goat's overwhelming popularity, reservations need to be planned over a month in advance to have dinner at a normal time. Well... here's a tip. If you don't mind eating early or late, you can probably just walk in without a reservation at around 4:30 PM or 11:30 PM and get seated pretty quickly. Service: impeccable, friendly, drinks always filled without asking, and waiter offered great recommendationsDecor: rustic yet classy, wooden tables, open concept kitchenFood: farm to table, tapas, freaking deliciousWe were told it's typically two dishes per person. We ordered 7 dishes between two people and we finished everything. We were super stuffed, but super satisfied. The menu changes regularly and I honestly think you really can't go wrong with any of the items on Girl & the Goat's menu. Even dishes that you might be skeptical about will win you over with one bite."
"big fan, very generous portions, diner style, varied menu, loud, raucous, just a fun place to be"
"We waited about an hour for a table, which wasn't too bad for a place you had to make reservations for probably a month in advance. The ambiance is very trendy, busy and a bit loud. We tried the beet salad- loved it! I love beets so I thoroughly enjoyed this dish, scallops- were also good! I can taste the fish sauce and the Asian vegetables which I'm very familiar with, the pig face was a bit too rich for me, I like the crunchy onions, and the chicken was moist but I was too full by then to really enjoy it. Everything was very fresh and delicious. The waiters were very informative and they gave us dessert for our anniversary!! It was amazing!! The walnuts and bacon toffee was perfect! I would definitely recommend this place!"
"I heard so many great things about this place. The food is everything you think it would be: delicious, accurate to description and very innovative. The staff on the other hand seems to always be in a rush to serve the food and send you on your way, hence the missing star."
"I have been here twice in the past 2 years has this is definitely more of a special occasion restaurant for me. The last time I was here with a vendor and several of my colleges. We proceeded to basically order the entire menu.Their staff is extremely knowledgeable about the cuisine, sensitive to all dietary restrictions and very very friendly and helpful. They truly have an awesome staff making Girl and the Goat an amazing experience, especially for the amount that you are paying.The food is adventurous by expectational. You should go in with the mind-set that you will try new things and not think too much about it, because it will be delicious but foreign to most people. Many choices for every category and palette. Get the breads - they are amazing and I am still thinking about them."
"I love Top Chef and I love Chicago-native, Stephanie Izard so, I had to come here. Our reservation was at 8:45pm and they called to confirm the day before. I tried getting an earlier time but there was none. There's ample parking in the area. Make sure you go to the right building though since there's Little Goat across the street with a huge picture of a goat on top that will easily catch your attention. The interior was very nice and we got seated as soon as we got there.We tried a few things. Tapas-style for about $12-20 a plate and desserts for $8. We got goat empanadas, escargot raviolo, kampachi crudo, goat belly and pig face. For dessert we had PB& J and bittersweet chocolate.Goat Empanadas:Goat meat, feta, pickled beets and tzatziki. The first dish that was served to us and got us all excited about this place. 5/5Kona Kampachi Crudo:Pork belly, caperberries and chili aioli. From the great empanadas, this dish wasn't as great. Thin slices of kampachi, 4 small pieces of crispy pork belly, some halves of caperberries and 3 paper-thin slices of bread. 3.5/5Escargot Ravioli:Escargot inside ravioli with bacon tamarind sauce. The disappointment continues. I love escargot and this was just too heavy because of the ravioli. Â The sauce was too thin and runny that it wouldn't stick to the ravioli at all. The idea was great but I think if this was served on individual Chinese spoons, it would've been much better - you get the sauce and the ravioli in one bite. 2/5Confit Goat Belly:Goat belly, lobster, crab, fennel in bourbon butter. Lobster claw pieces, chunks of crab meat and a baton of slightly fatty, tender, juicy goat belly. This was one of my favorites from Girl & the Goat. This prevented us from leaving the restaurant. 5/5Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face:Pork cheek, potato sticks, sunny side egg (over easy), tamarind, cilantro and red wine maple. Another winner in my book. Breakfast on a plate. Like bacon, eggs and potatoes. Crisp pork cheek and potato sticks, soft egg, sweet and sour tamarind and added layers of flavor from the cilantro and red wine maple. YUM! 5/5Bittersweet Chocolate:Shiitake-caramel gelato, brownie and toffee creme fraiche. The gelato was great. The brownie was just alright and there was too much of it. I liked the hint of toffee. Marginal dessert. 3/5PB&J:Salted peanut semifreddo, brioche doughnuts and grape granita. I'm not a fan of peanut butter but I was pleasantly surprised by this dessert. Cold semifreddo and granita, and warm doughnuts. The semifreddo wasn't too nutty and the grape granita was perfect with it. Delish! 4/5Service was great. Bread isn't complimentary. Next time I come back, I'll skip the escargot ravioli and crudo...and get something else."
One of the best meals I have ever eaten.Each course got better and betterEscargot ravioli was amazingThe cauliflower and broc was really goodPork head and lamb shank was greatReally great service and just a really good experience.
"Holy goat! Everything we tried was amazeballs!I really wanted to come here for my birthday but we weren't able to get reservations. However, the hubby and I decided we would chance it and wait for a table (which I really, really never do - I am a reservations kinda gal). Â But waiting paid off. We sat on the cozy couches by the window and enjoyed a cocktail while we waited. Â They said it would be about a 45minute wait and they sure were exact. Â We were seated and warmly welcomed by the hostess and server. Â Honestly, we were so hungry that we chose about six different plates (and I don't remember all of them but everything we had was indeed ""amazeballs""). I do have to say that the broiled octopus was exquisite! it had a smoky flavor to it... different... but excellent.Everything we tasted was delicious, the ambiance was cozy and the service was excellent. Â It was worth the wait."
"god menu, and decent portions for a gourmet foodie place"
"Did not live up to the hype, for me. If this is a favorite among ""foodies"" then they are either getting different food than I had, or they need to take a trip to New York and learn what good food actually tastes like. I was so incredibly psyched to go to this restaurant. My first trip to Chicago with my family, I identified this as one of the best restaurants in the area so made reservations. Â I had never watched top chef before, but was so thrilled about going to eat here that I watched the entirety of Season 4 before going to Chicago. Let me say that the service was fantastic. That is the only reason I am giving three stars. We were seated immediately and served promptly. There was also a nice cadence to the meal, kept as such with much attention from the staff. The cocktail I ordered was delicious (ruby don't love). Taco bread. This was ok. The bread was seasoned well. Baby octopus was terrible. The octopus was over cooked (rubbery). The entire dish was so salty that it was impossible to taste anything else. Chickpea fritters. These were bland, like fried tofu. The yogurt sauce really couldn't save it. Green beans. Also incredibly salty. Â I have had better green beans from a crappy Chinese buffet. I don't understand the need for all this salt. The Halibut was alright. Nothing special. Halibut is tough to screw up. (Like sea bass). It's just naturally a very savory dish. The pig face was delicious. It's a bit fatty, but honestly this was the one dish that actually tasted good. Shishito peppers were soggy and bland. Â Dessert was alright but honestly we were so incredibly disappointed by that time that it was tough to really enjoy it. If you decide to go here, I hope your experience is better than ours."
"Well I am being nice! walked into a really cool fun atmosphere on a Tuesday night at 7PM, which happened to be my birthday. We got seated immediately at our table for two on the side that separated from the bar. We were really excited since we had heard all the hype about this place for a couple years now and the thousands of reviews on here. The waitress came right away gave us some recommendations, we got our drinks which were pretty good. And then came the food.... we got the:Ham Frites AKA fries in beer batter and ham tasting with some chilli powder i believe. They were were pretty good. Not sure how you can go wrong with fries though so nothing special.Italian Sausage Bread ($4): Basically a whole loaf of bread. It tasted like pizza, it was really good. Probably our favorite part. Crispy on the outside with chunks of sausage on the inside and dough. Real good. Baby octopus: Well, everyone raved about it and waitress suggested it, and we love octopus. There may have been a total of 2 pieces of baby octopus in there all cut up with a bunch of vegetables and this heavy tangy sauce. Quite disappointed.Escargot Ravioli: 4 pieces, weird texture, again,,,nothing special. the sauce was pretty good though we dipped our bread in this sauce. The Roasted Cauliflower: just grilled or roasted cauliflower. We definitely needed this after all the carb and probably the only reason we finished it because we downed the bread and fries. but definitely nothing special. It will take you 5 minutes to make the same at home. And finally the Pig Face: Fattiest, Greasiest meal of all. Not sure how anyone eats this, It was SOO FATTY! comes with an egg on top and they say mix it all together, definitely tastes like pure oil and putting a piece of lard in my mouth. The waitress noticed our displeased faces on the pig face and was kind enough to take it off our bill. Overall, I was incredibly disappointed by the food and would give it a 2, just because the bread was good and everything else was edible just not WOW I gotta go back. The drinks were a 3 or 4. Ambiance and service 5. I may go back here just if I am in the area and want to grab a drink otherwise I'll let them be for the people that grew up eating tasteless American food and TV dinners, I would understand why they would like this."
"+++- Grilled broccoli was top notch++- Bartenders know how to make a drinik or two, my Old Fashion was amazing- Rhubarb shortcake dessert was all sorts of delicious without that filling feeling- Pig face tasted like bacon- Calamari was good, I liked the presentation (not the traditional rings), and the lamb filling was a tasty compliment+- Gotta get a goat dish, I got the empanadas. It's kind of small, order something else if you intend to share-- Crab rangoon didn't have much crab insideTIPS:- You can eat in the bar waiting area on the side- Food, for the most part is pretty big portion, I'd recommend 1.5 orders pp"
"Best meal I've had in a long time. Really. You must eat here.You have to make reservations but can only do it 45days max in advance. We were late by a day and most of the prime time slots were taken. We settled for a 4:30 dinner. Hunter, our server, amazing! I would like all my servers to be as informative and efficient as he was. He also knew how to suggest balance to our multi-dish dinner based on what we certainly did want to try. *** Love, love, love the Green Beans with fish sauce vinagrette. Perfectly cooked green beans and don't be fooled by the fish sauce vin. It was one of the best tasting things I've introduced to my palate. Goat Carpaccio - such beautiful art on the plate. Flavors and textures were spot on for carpaccio. The goat was not gamey.Dessert: Miso Toffee Boudino - Came back a few days later just to order it to go."
"Can't believe it's STILL this hard to get a reservation here - it's definitely holding onto it's hip reputation. Â Went with a group and we got a bunch of plates to share - they ended up bring pretty hefty portion sizes so I was annoyed that they told us we had to order everything up front... we never would have ordered so many ""small plates"" if we knew their true size - since we couldn't take leftovers home we ended up wasting a bunch of food. Â I understand it's easier on the staff if we order everything ahead of time but I felt we were somewhat misled and ended up with a bigger bill and wasting almost half of those last few dishes. Â Service was very good and attentive otherwise. Â The run down on what we ordered: Â The kohlrabi salad has olives in it! Â Beware!!!! Â I'm not subtracting any points for this because not everybody hates these foul morsels as much as I do. Â The escargot ravioli was very earthy and well-prepared. Â Cauliflower was savory but excessively and unnecessarily oiled. The shishito peppers were ok but also really oily I'm not a fan of pools of oil at the bottom of my dishes. Â Don't get me wrong I eat cream and butter and high fat content but I don't think it's appetizing when the oil is gathered there at the bottom of the bowl. Â If that's where it collects - why not use less? Â Scallops were bomb tho as was the fish. Â Not a terrible meal but a lil over hyped I guess, which is why I went with ""A-OK"" for my review."
"First and foremost, the food is exceptional. Every dish we had was completely amazing; the hype is well deserved.I've been here twice, and what I've learned is just how valuable an excellent server really is. The service on my first visit was capable, but not exceptional. This is the kind of menu that requires guidance and explanation, and a few nights ago we were fortunate enough to have Owen as our server. He was with us every step of the way, consistently checking in to help us pace out our plates so that we weren't overwhelmed. At one point, he even checked in with us to make sure we didn't feel as though we had over-ordered; we had visitors from out of town and were determined to try as much as humanly possible. We were well cared for every step of the way, from Owen to the food runners to the bussers to the host staff. And that, my friends, makes even the most impressive dish taste just a little bit better."
"10 out of 10 - would eat it again. Â So good. Â I have been dying to go to here after hearing rave reviews from people and FINALLY made it. Â Thank you Taste of Randolph for allowing us to walk in with no wait... ya that rarely ever happens.We decided to just go for it and order a bunch of stuff to share. Â I have to say, anything off the specials menu...do it. Â You definitely won't be disappointed. Â Along with the food being most excellent, the drinks were delish to boot. Â I can't wait to go back and feast again. Â Definitely a must for anyone who hasn't been."
"My wife came with me on this trip and she was so looking forward to the goat and it did not disappoint. Â  Wow amazing. Â We ordered 5 dishes and a bottle of wine Wine was her own blend from walla walla Washington. Â Great winery 3 hours from our home in Idaho. Â A fantastic blend. Â Our waitress was amazing to walk us thru our meal. Â Again Vegies were the bomb. Magic beans, cauliflower, and broccoli the Â beans are the best. Had the duck tong loved it my wife thought too greasy. Added a fish so we had the mussels. They were outstanding. Â  My wife ordered the item free bread. Even I liked it. Â Best meal of our foodie trip"
"As far as I'm concerned, The Girl and the Goat is a must try for any visitor (or resident) of Chicago. Just make sure you secure a reservation well in advance, otherwise you will be mad dogging those at the crowded bar area to quickly finish up and leave, as I unabashedly did.I tried two items on the menu. The first was the delightfully complex Kona Kampachi Crudo. The raw fish was light and refreshing, but when paired with crisp pork belly, it became a delicious play on surf and turf. The contrast in flavors, textures, and temperatures was amazing. The chili aoili added spice and richness, the pickled caperberries provided just the right amount of acidity, and the bread crisps gave the dish another layer of texture.The second item I tried was none other than the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. After seeing Anthony Bourdain eat this on The Layover, I knew I had to order it. But to be honest, the dish was little more challenging than I thought it would be. The pig face was really intense, gamy even. The trio of sauces -- tamarind, red-wine maple, and cilantro -- helped to offset the pungent flavor of the meat, but I found the first two a tad sweet, even when mixed up with the glorious yolk of the fried egg on top. Finally, the fried potato sticks added much needed texture. I loved it for its bold (dare I say, in your face?) exoticism, but the sheer decadence of this dish makes it one to share and not hog to yourself.The decor is very hip and modern, and the service was what one might expect from such a red hot spot -- a little vain, a little aloof, a little haughty. But I still had a good time and will surely come back the next time I'm in Chicago.4 1/2 stars"
Excellent all around
Delicious and unusual-- I can't wait to go back!
"Hot spot, jam-packed. Pig face was great, shared about 6-7 dishes between 4 people. Small serving sizes. The beet salad was great."
"One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! Â Stephanie Izard's culinary mind is incredible. Â Part of the BOKA restaurant group. Â Service is impeccable every time I go. Â The menu changes but never disappoints. Â I have sat in the dining room and most recently at the bar, amazing service and experience in both locations. Â At the bar, we had the pleasure of being served by Lily. Â Lily is prob one of the best servers I've had. Â The staff here knows their stuff. Â She was kind enough to go through the menu, recommend a bottle of wine (2006 Basel Cellars), and let us taste one of the beers on tap. Â Perfectly informative! Â Once our bottle was popped it was time to get down to business. Â We ordered....Roasted Cauliflower (half order) cooked to perfection. Â Roasted Beets (half order) that were so fresh. Â Celery root & Cheddar Pierogies (half order, two), kind of a combo between pierogie and empanada, really good! Â Seared Diver Scallops, two come w the order and they are HUGE. Â Seared perfectly. Â Duck Tongues, HOLY DUCK these were delish! Â First time eating duck or tongue and I am glad I did. Â Crispy Beef Short Ribs, like perfect meat croutons. I dream about these short ribs. Â And last but not least we had the Confit Goat Belly. Â The bourbon butter made my mouth water. Â I will not wait a year again before going back! Â They open at 4:30 and have a line by 4:45. Â Either make reservations or prepare to enjoy a cocktail while waiting for your table. Â The house cocktails are on point. Â Most of which designed by the awesome bartenders (shout out to Tony). Â I've seen all kinds of attire. Â Staff wears jeans and t-shirts but the food commands more than shorts!"
"OH MY GOSH. Easily my most favorite place to spoil my stomach. I came here for the first time this past Friday with an under-appreciation for food, and left with a graduated taste palate. I mean, everything just tasted genius. We had the pig face (I was so so so hesitant because the name sounds semi-disturbing, but trust me-- look pass the weirdness and GET IT because Lord have mercy it was MMM good), the monkfish, the broccoli (let's try and be healthy, ok?), and the goat belly. Everything tasted really good, just make sure you take a bite of everything on the dish together because you wouldn't believe how well everything complements each other. It all just makes sense with every single savory bite. The portions are just right, and it's well worth the wait!!! Â Ahhh, please suh, I want some mo'."
"It was ok, but I wasn't blown away. I had read rave reviews about this place and we were planning a trip to Chicago so I made a reservation. The trip was 3-4 weeks away and there was only 1 time available (10:30pm) so we went for it.We arrived 20 min early and were seated right away. The restaurant had great atmosphere, it felt warm and inviting. My boyfriend and I love cocktails and theirs did not disappoint. Food on the other hand was just ok. I had run the marathon and I was starving so we ordered 5-6 plates to share. I honestly can't remember a dish that stood out or that I'd want again. I do remember reading amazing reviews on the pig face and both my boyfriend and I did not really care for it. It was heavy and greasy, I don't think we even finished it. I can't say I'd never go back, but there are so many great spots in Chicago that I'd rather try first."
"If I could have listed this as 6 stars, I would have. Stephanie's team delivered one of the best experiences ever. We sat at the Chef's Table, the closest thing to being in the kitchen without actually be in the kitchen. Our server, Leigh, was perfect. Chefs Chris and Quinten were funny and enjoyable to converse with. The food blew us away! We ate everything: Cauliflower, broccoli, calamari bruschetta, grilled baby octopus, shisito peppers, pig face, chickpea fritters, empanadas. I actually proposed to my girlfriend and I have to thank Lucy for helping orchestrate everything. The entire staff was incredible and we cannot wait to come back. Keep doing what you're doing. Top notch!"
"My wife and I are vegetarian, and they have a whole section of veggie options on menu. We tried almost everything. Really great mixture of exotic flavor in every dish. Portions are huge! I'd recommend ordering only a couple, then adding more as you go along. Great service, and great environment."
"Finally got a reservation here (5:30 pm was all that was available even though we booked months in advance). Had the halibut, escargot ravioli, pork shank, garlic pierogis, roasted cauliflower, and rice pudding. My favorite was the halibut and my husband's was pierogis, but really everything was fantastic! We had also ordered the goat confit belly, but had to cancel it al the last minute when we realized we were getting too full. Next time! Also, the selection of beers was awesome, and I had the best dirty vodka martini I've ever had before, made with locally made Vodka. Last but not least, the service was perfect and out waitress did a great job of guiding us through the menu and helping us streamline our order. Highly recommend!"
The food is excellent. They have a great room for private parties and business dinners.
"This place has been on my list to visit for years and I'm so pleased that I was finally able to go there whilst on a trip to Chicago over the holidays. We didn't plan far enough in advance to get a reservation, so we went just before 4:30 pm when it opened in hopes of getting a table, which we did. I was shocked by how many people were there at that time given that it was a Monday evening (albeit between Christmas and New Year's), but that is just a testament to how amazing it is. I can't stop thinking about the feta bread (freshly baked across the street) that came with hummus and oil, the cauliflower salad, the crispy short ribs with avocado and the grilled octopus salad. We also tried the pig face which was a bit fatty for me, but still good. I want to come back again and again!"
"Well, Â I've been waiting to try this place and finally was able to last night. In one visit I went from curious onlooker to rabid fan. Â I would seriously put this up with some of my favorite restaurants - top 10 for sure - maybe even top 5 - no joke, Â this place was that good. Where to start. .. the decor - awesome! Â Dark""burnt"" timbers form a massive focal point at the center of the restaurant - maybe only upstaged by the vibrant open kitchen. Really beautiful place. The staff and service? Â Absolutely spot - on! Â Everyone we encountered had that service superstar sixth sense of just ""getting it"" - perfectly balancing casual and professional - but mostly just being hip, Â fun and normal. But that all aside, Â this place is ultimately about the food - and their kitchen rocks! Â I won't describe all 13 small plates we ordered, Â but here's a few highlights:- Kohlrabi salad with apples, Â fennel and shiitake- Himachi crudo with crisp pork belly- Pan - roasted halibut with white asparagus- Sugo (like braised beef gravy) over pappardelle- Confit of goat belly with bourbon butter, Â lobster and crabOne was better than the previous - everything melted in your mouth (literally) - the flavor combinations at times were downright stunning! Â Let's put it this way - when I write this much about a place and haven't even mentioned beverage? ! You know I must have loved it - and how could I not, Â when their background music included Biggie, Â Johnny Cash and The Cure? !Great, Â Great restaurant worth all the praise they receive. Â If you haven't tried, you have to!"
"All around....excellent! We did not have a reservation, and they accommodated us very quickly. Â Atmosphere was awesome, service was fantastic. Â If you took a drink of your water i swear someone filled it back up 15 seconds after you took a drink. Â We ordered the chickpea fritters, the pork shank, and the goat empanada. Â All of which were excellent. Â I would have to say the fritters were my favorite. Â The portions aren't huge as most of the dishes are made to be shared by a couple people, but the blend of flavors are awesome. Â Cant wait to go back!"
"I have to say, I was a little disappointed. Maybe I didn't try enough, but nothing was really that outstanding to me. I had the raw oysters (not briny enough for me, but not a reflection on the restaurant), the roasted cauliflower (good, but seemed pretty basic), pan fried frog legs (I liked the jicama, but again, nothing really popped for me), lamb tartare (rye crackers were my favorite part of this), maize and blue roll (I was expecting something more savory and buttery), and the goat empanadas (fine, but I honestly don't remember them). Despite not loving the food as much as I expected, I would definitely return and explore other parts of the menu. I may have just been suffering from unreal expectations. The service was fantastic and the atmosphere relaxing. Also, props to Girl & the Goat for having three women working the line. Always nice to see."
"I went with a friend for her birthday. Our waiter was personable. Everything was delicious, especially the mussels. This restaurant is definitely on my list of favorites."
"5 stars soley for the crisp pork shank. fo reals. i mean, how can anyone deny fall off the bone pork with crispy skin, accompanied by a spicy and creamy sauce? (ok, maybe if you're vegetarian).... Â and yes, the other dishes were good (but this one i still dream about, 3 weeks later).its crowded, its loud. its busy. get over it. moderately priced. go get it."
"Had fun and loved the environment. Â Lot's of choices for a foodie, and for a vegetarian. Â Great wine list!"
"One of the best meals I've had in a long time. I mean it with all my foodie heart.I got lucky because we were driving back from Green Bay after the Packers-Dallas football game (3 hours away) and made a 9:15pm reservations on Open Table (so glad they have this because I wouldnt even thought about going here without a reservation knowing how busy they are!!). The dishes we got -- - Wood fired old 1971: lightly cooked with fresh horseradish and bacon bits. The only 'cooked' oysters I've ever eaten and liked.- Parmesan Cheese bread - amazingly light and tasty!- Hamachi Crudo - tasty and a good dish but there were many more good dishes. - Wood oven roasted pig face - OMG! the meat is crispy and the egg on top supplements the pig perfectly. One of the BEST dishes of the night.- Confit goat belly - If not the best dish but second BEST dish behind the Pig Face but the goat belly tasted amazing with the lobster and crab bites. A well rounded dish!Desserts:Cheese with Honey - VERY good!Icecream with mushroom - dont remember the full details of the dish but it was very tasty and a great end to the mealOverall, I am very very happy I was able to eat here.I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone living and/or visiting in Chicago. I'm sad I live in SF :( Might have to plan a summer trip........"
"I went here with my mom a few months ago. We went during the day so the crowd was very light. She was the perfect date because she did not order alcohol and I know what kind of food she likes. We order the salmon, steak and peas.The portions were very small but the peas came by the bulk. I probably will not come here again, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good."
"This place is incredible and I can't wait to go back multiple times. We waited about an hour and a half for a table but started with a drink and appetizer at the bar. We started with the fried naked cowboy oysters with an egg salad topping. They were incredible, we were talking about them days after we ate them. Then we were seated and our server Trevor was awesome, he came by at the right moments, steered us in the right direction with food choices and made us feel right at home. We shared the escargot ravioli, the crudo hamachi, the lamb stuffed calamari, goat belly confit as well as the passion fruit dessert. We were stunned with every dish. I will be back many times over"
"Absolutely my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Â You won't find better value for food this tasty. Â I've been several times and have never had anything bad, though some dishes do vary in their quality on each visit (the escargot ravioli and pig face are usually amazing, but I've had each a couple times and sometimes they're a little off). Â The vegetables are all enormous servings and are tremendous, especially the cauliflower. Â The shishito peppers are also great, but are really rich and a bit much if you're only splitting for two people. Â Other great things I've had there include the broccoli, chickpea fritters, goat empanadas, goat belly, short ribs (and this from someone who doesn't really eat beef), and the beets. Â Cannot recommend enough!"
Delicious! Â I went for a baby shower and found the food and atmosphere to be awesome! Â I can't wait to go back:)
"I finally made it past the three month waiting period to snag a table at the utterly hyped Girl & The Goat. Â I would highly recommend you to make reservations to avoid the long lines and ensure yourself a table, especially if it is for a larger party. Â I came here with a party of five on a Wednesday evening. Â The dim overhead lighting and wooden furniture gave off a rustic vibe.The rotating menu is separated into three sections: vegetables, seafood, and meats. Â The food is served family style, so the server recommended about 8-10 dishes for our party to share. Â We decided on: Fried Pickles: served with shallot aioli and yuzu harissa sauce. Â The pickles were not overly breaded, so you still have that crunch and sourness from the pickles. Â If prefer a more citrus and creamy texture, dip it in the shallot aioli. Â But if you want a more of a spiciness and tartness to your pickles, go ahead and use the yuzu harissa sauce. Â  Â  Â Sauteed Green Beans: dressed up with fish sauce vinaigrette and topped off with cashews. Â This is definitely one of the top dishes I had tried here. Â The green beans were cooked perfectly, so they still had that crunchiness to them. Â The sauce they used must have been crack because none of us could stop eating them.Goat Empanadas: on top of marinated sheep feta, pickled golden beets, and tzatziki sauce. Â The goat meat wasn't gamey at all, but rather really tender. Â The cheese, beets, and tzatziki sauce gave off a creamy texture to the whole entrÃ©e.Wood Fired Wiley Point Oysters: topped with horseradish, bacon, and preserved lemon. Â I didn't eat this entrÃ©e due to allergies, but my friends did. Â They weren't a big fan of it only because the oysters were warm. Â I guess raw and warm oysters don't go well together.Kona Kampachi Crudo: accompanied with crisp pork belly, chili aioli, and caperberries. Â The presentation on this dish was amazing, as well as the taste. Â The kampachi was really fresh and had a really smooth texture to it. Â I was a little worried that pork belly would overpower the taste of the fish, but it didn't. Â It just gave the whole dish that extra crunch.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, and topped off with a sunny side egg and potato stix. Â Oh my, I think I would have to say this is the best tasting dish of the night. Â Everything about this dish was on point. Â You pretty much have to break the egg and mix everything together. Â The pork was really tender that it just melted in your mouth. Â There wasn't enough of this dish to go around.Braised Beef Tongue: served mixed with masa, beef vinaigrette, and salsa verde. Â I never had beef tongue so I have nothing to compare it with, but the tongue was really tender. Â There were so many different textures and flavors incorporated in this dish: crunch from the masa, spice and smoothness from the salsa, and a touch of sourness from the vinaigrette. Grilled Skirt Steak: served with a root vegetable salad drizzled with cajeta. Â This wasn't the best tasting steak in Chicago, but it was still good. Â The steak was cooked beautifully at a medium rare. Â I also like the touch of sweetness from the cajeta.Overall, my experience here was amazing. Â The Girl & The Goat is definitely worth the wait and the hype. Â The server here was really attentive and knowledgeable about everything on the menu. Â He always had a smile on his face and didn't let the busy environment frazzle him. Â The food here was remarkable. Â There are so many different flavors and textures that will tickle your taste buds. Â If you are on the fence about giving this place a try, just take the leap. Â You won't regret it."
"I have been to this place a few times and never been let down. Â The Pig Face is amazing. Â Also, get the Goat Belly with the Lobster.. FANTASTIC. Â Be open to trying everything on the menu if you can, things look scary but if you are open you will be pleasantly surprised."
"STOP READING EVERYONE'S REVIEW AND ORDER THE PIG FACE.I mean, really. Your mind will be blown.It sounds weird and sure you are expecting a snout and eyes, but it's not.It's all kinds of goodness with a fried egg. Â I made the mistake of not ordering it. I still regret it, but I plan to be back.Tip: If you want a recommendation from your waiter, keep in mind how many times they are asked for the ""what do you eat here?"" Â Ask them what they don't like and go from there.Vegetables, fish, libations, oysters, cheese, it's all good. Reservations are recommended, but there may be a 1% chance you win over someone sitting at the bar (first come first served) and they wink at you to take their place.True story, it happened to me. Sitting and eating within 20 minutes, NO JOKE. Valet parking is recommended although you might score stuff on the street. Â Meatpacking and Stephanie, you didn't disappoint."
"Before we went, we were intimidated by the ""pig face"" centricity of the place. But ended up ordering lots of veggies and they were terrific. Creative, rustic, modern (dichotomy) with a great sound track and top-notch food. Service was somewhat cold. Get this:Modern luxury cocktailTelenovela tequila cocktailChickpea frittersCauliflower"
"First and foremost, I've been in the culinary industry myself for a few years, mainly as a dishwasher. Â So the first thing I noticed was the plates. After plates are used for awhile, they get small lines or cracks in them which is fine. The problem comes in when those cracks or lines turn brownish in color which means they're packed with harmful bacteria, thus the discoloration and therefore they should be thrown out. A lot of the plates I had had those brownish lines. Its really a health hazard. Waiter service here is excellent.Ambiance is pretty nice. Good selection/music mixture.Now onto the food. I really dont see what the big deal is or why I had to wait 3 months to get in here. The food is definitely farm fresh, yet a bit on the oily side. The flavor combinations and textures are typical.For bread we had ghums n roses. The bread was very hearty and came with a honey based spread and apple sauce. My wife and I couldn't taste the honey in the spread but the apple sauce was good.The hamachi cudo had an entree price but was appetizer small. The pork belly they had as garnish tasted fishy without a unique flavor of its own.The lamb ribs were extremely fresh. So fresh that it was almost gamey. I dont know if thats good or bad. They should've soaked it in a little in milk first. They were however extremely tender, just a little fatty though.The sauteed green beans were very good and fresh. I'd recommend them and I never recommend vegetables as the sworn and true king of carnivores. I had the La Paloma, a tequila and grapefruit cocktail, as my drink. Expensive, nothing special, and definately not strong.My wife ordered the goat empanadas. Also expensive, but didn't taste anywhere as good as they'd be at a hole in the wall birrieria in a mexican neighborhood where they give you a gallon of it, birria, for $10.I shant return, but at least I can say I've eaten here."
"The girl and the goat will forever have my heart... Or at least as long as it's open. The place is amazing from the drinks to the desserts.Be sure to make a reservation as they book up very fast or show up early and you can usually get a table fairly quickly. I have had the pleasure of trying almost everything on the menu and I'd say the stand outs to me would be the broccoli, the cauliflower, goat empanadas, scallops, braised beef ribs, the pork shank and the goat belly confit. You literally can't go wrong with anything on this menu. Enjoy!"
"Amazing food, service, and table! We were able to get the chef's table and see all the action in the kitchen! We ordered 5 different dishes and they were all amazing. The drinks were amazing, the dessert was amazing - loved everything.They take reservations (book months in advance) and asks for the chef's table if there are just 2 of you!"
"I feel spoiled. Now that I've had the opportunity to dine here, I do believe Girl & The Goat has ruined me for all other dining experiences. The ambiance is great. It's upscale without being pretentious. Service was impecable. Having done my homework before coming, I knew the menu and had a good idea about things to order based on reviews found here. Surprisingly, some of the dishes I was most excited to try turned out to be my least favorites (mind you, still delicious) and the items I was on the fence about trying, ended up being my absolute favorites! In order of favorites - it goes like this:duck tongues - 5 starswood oven roasted pig face - 5 starskohlrabi salad - 5 starscrisp braised pork shank (this is so high up here because of the onion kimchee, yum!) - 5 starsgoat empanadas - 5 starspan roasted halibut - 4 starsroasted cauliflower - 4 starsgrilled shrimp - 4 starssauteed green beans - 3 starsconfit goat belly - 3 starsescargot ravioli - 3 starsfried pickles - 3 starsHighly recommend to go with a group of people so you have the chance to try a little bit of everything. We were a group of six and that was perfect! Can't wait to return!!!"
"This place gets quite glowing reviews, but the taste can be eccentric to some of the guests. First the positive, we were a bunch of graduating students, and our waitress was fantastic. She gave us great recommendations on food and even offered us some free desserts to celebrate the occasion. These small gestures really go a long way in demonstrating the class of this place. In addition, this place is lively. I really enjoyed the atmosphere, especially that you can see the cooks and the kitchen clearly. Now moving on to some improvements, most of the dishes we ordered were quite good including the octopus and lamb. I was however not a big fan of the goat milk ice cream dish and some of the beets dish. The flavors can be on and off. Some dishes tasted great! Others just tasted a bit forced. Nonetheless, the combination of a cool atmosphere, caring waitresses, and decent food would relax and charm everyone. Pricing wise, this place is also quite decent. The food is meant to be shared tapas style, so order many and share amongst yourselves. Most dishes are between $10-20 and are very decent size for sharing. Definitely ask the waitress for some of the recommendations as I found them to be quite good."
"Maybe it's me, but the older I get and the more I eat out, the less saltiness I can tolerate!!! Don't get me wrong, the food was great! But the SALT! Oh man! You really can't eat too much because you bloat so fast! We had the sauteed green beans, roasted cauliflower, seared diver scallops, roasted pig face, and the brioche. Sadly, no room for dessert! I'm giving 4 stars because the service was so great! We sat bar-style in front of the kitchen, so we had a chance to see all the delicious looking food go by, which is pure torture when you're hungry! But we couldn't decide between the green beans and cauliflower, but we picked green beans, and later, our waitress brought us a small helping of the cauliflower, which I thought was really sweet of her!So 4 because of service, 3 for the food. We ended up taking home the leftovers and I scrambled them with some freshly cracked eggs to cut down on the salty taste a little and had them for breakfast."
"We flew in from Hawaii & our Graduate Daughter @ Columbia College picked this Restaurant for her special Dinner over any other in Chicago!Needless to say after making our Reservation 3 months ago we were led to a table outside next to where everyone would walk past to enter the Restaurant.The 2nd table was a Communal Table & finally we were given a table by ourselves..........Service was spotty with several times waiting awhile for clearing & water.Food was really good except 2 dishes one being very Salty(Green Beans),the other being tasteless/oily (Fried Oyster)The loudness inside is really unacceptable & we had to yell to hear each other........We are sure that if Chef Stephanie was working that the experience would be much different!Also, we were sad that the Staff showed no Aloha.....Would probably come back if Chef was working"
"Wow...This was my first time in Chicago so I was excited to try all the delicious food, and this restaurant really proved that Chicago won't let you down in the food department! We tried the trout, Brussel sprouts and wine...everything was delicious! The service was great as well. I highly recommend the girl and the goat, as well as their cafe across the street."
"This was my first visit after hearing a lot of good things about the food and flavors incorporated in their dishes and it didn't disappoint. We ordered the shrimp & grit bread, cauliflower, cuttlefish, scallops, and spare ribs. Â While they are a self-proclaimed small plate restaurant, most portions were pleasantly large. The cauliflower was enough to feed 5-6 people and had great flavors with pickled peppers. The cuttlefish and spare ribs were both large and extremely flavorful.The only exception to the portion size was the scallops: 2 scallops for $15, seemed pricey, but the flavors were again really good pairing the scallops with a hint of heat and earthy mushroom taste. They tell you to order 4 plates for 2 people, but you really only need to order 2 plates, as long as you don't get the scallops.Cocktails were overpriced $14 for an Old Fashion (Old Goat), but that's kind of the norm in Chicago, right?"
"This is a bit overdue... but that place deserves all the praise they can get! The ambiance, people, knowledge, service, drinks and the food... ahhh, the food. Everything is superb! I threw my birthday party in their private room downstairs a couple months back. Had 19 people and one of the best nights of my life. Yes, it's pricey, but YES, it's worth it - SOOO worth it! Every bite was worth it! The whole process of finding out info/pricing, food options/pairings, drink options, minimums, limits, etc. and then actually booking, was very smooth & easy. Communication with Ashley and Brandi was great and they answered my questions very quickly. Then a couple months passed, and March came.. and it was the day to celebrate. No snow storms can keep me, or my family and friends, away!When I got there, I was warmly greeted and taken downstairs, had a little bit of time to get the room decorated (you can bring balloons and some signs, etc - it made it so much more intimate/personable). Then I was introduced to my waiter for the evening, one of the nicest people I met in the industry, Gary (thanks SO MUCH for everything that evening, Gary - and thanks for letting me throw confetti all over the place!). Full bar (so many delicious sips, by glass or bottle!), 13 course menu (some of the best food I ever had - everything was made to perfection!), amazing company & incomparable service, made the night one that I will always remember. Thank you G&TG - I will definetely be back, as soon as I can get in :)"
"This place is the it place to be in Chicago isnt it? Every time I've walked by it's been crazy crowded. I looked at the resys a month out and usually 10.30 is the seating you can get. Crazyness. Having done a small food run and eaten at a few other places prior. this was the last dinner I'd have on the list. Having flown in from Copenhagen, Im was still a bit on European time but that didnt stop my appetite. Of course the place was full when I walked in but the bevy of hosts said to eyeball the bar and sure enough a spot opened up. I sidled up to a number of crazy characters and even though it was decently deep, the bartender spotted me right away. We were off to a good start. If Im going to a place with goat in the name, im gonna get something with goat in it:Confit Goat Bellybourbon butter, lobster n' crab, fennel Goat and Lobster? Fuck yeah. That's second only to Kobe Wagyu fed Lobster!Make no mistake this was a rich dish and if I hadnt eaten at 3 other places I'd still say so. I washed it down with a Â Chicago Derby: Four Roses Bourbon, Demerara, Mint. Tasty all around. Im not sure how I would have fared with a party bigger than myself but being along at the bar led to many a conversation with people around me and a fellow who was in from NYC and was doing the same food jumping I was. Service is solid considering the crush that they deal with constantly. Bartenders were especially astute and attentive just when they needed to be. Some day Ill try a normal dinner go, but until now I was pretty satisfied and stuffed with my last of the dinners in Chicago."
"Woohoooooo. Girl and the Goat has a secret vegan menu, you just have to request it! Most are items that are modified from their vegetable menu, but our server steered me towards the tempura veggies as she said it is dedicated vegan and it was the shit. The fennel salad & charred broccoli were also super tasty. We arrived around 6 and snageed bar seats and had a wonderful experience, thank you Veronica for being so accommodating, friendly and awesome!"
"After reading all the gushing reviews, I was expecting a lot... so maybe my two stars are a bit harsh but I was really unimpressed.My wife and I went here two days ago. We had been wanting to go for a long time, and we could only get reservations for 4:30pm on a Tuesday afternoon for dinner. I just didn't get what all the hype was about. We ordered several things - chickpea fritters, pig face, ribs, oysters, scallops, and bread. Pig face and ribs felt too rich. Oysters were tiny and not particularly well prepared. It felt kind of cheap that bread is something you order. They had three types of bread, we had the sour one - nothing special. The fritters were good, probably the best thing we had. We had the brownie for dessert, which was very good. The service was pretty bad. We felt rushed the whole time. We had come for a leisurely meal. We had a fairly expensive bottle of wine ($75 - Obsidian 2011, which was great) and wanted to enjoy things. The server kept rushing us. It was clear they wanted to keep the tables moving. She also asked that we order everything at once, and it made us feel like we couldn't order more if we wanted. I probably would have ordered more because we were still hungry, but we didn't ask. Our total bill was a little more than $200."
"Girl and the Goat...much ado about nothing or lives up to the Michelin notoriety or even more esteemed...the highly coveted 5 star yelp views?!The interior was OK. Location is in a chic part of Randolph St.The night started with a bartender whiskey cocktail special not on the menu. SOLID.Had the green bean appetizer, scallops, and two goat dishes, the belly and the empanadas overall. The presentations were HIGHLY DESIGNED.The green beans however were just AVERAGE. I can think of several other spots that can compete and even do much better.The scallops were simply AMAZING. Wish there were more than 3 though. Now to the main reason I came to this place where the fancy title could be out of the Great Gatsby novel. The empanadas... were delish but after all because it was fried and mixed in with a slew of other ingredients that I couldn't really tell if I was eating chicken or goat....except for the pungent odor from the goat meat.Now the goat belly... All I can say is sometimes you eat cuz it tastes superb but other times cuz of the lofty price tag it carries. And this was the latter. Washed it down with some good old reliable whiskey. A disclaimer is that it was my first goat experience.Wished all the hype lived up to my palate expectations. Came with an open mind and with high hopes. Even celebrated a birthday occasion. I will try it one more time. Could have been an off night for both. But I can't help wondering if this place would have been half as successful if it was just the Girl minus the obscure & exotic Goat."
"I had heard so much great stuff about this restaurant- both from Yelp, TV, and other foodies. I hate to say it, but I just wasn't blown away. The service and ambiance were both excellent. Restaurant is decorated well, has a cool casual but still upscale vibe, and an open kitchen is always fun. I also like the menu style, where you order several dishes for the table to taste.I can't remember everything we ordered, but we did go for the goat kebabs and pig face. I thought it was all a solid ""very good."" Maybe it's because we had just eaten at Alinea the night before, but I felt like everything tasted SOOO heavy. Each dish had lots of components and very rich flavors. There wasn't anything that I am dying to go back for or that made me want to lick the plate. I wish I could say it was as amazing as everyone else says it is, but it just fell short for me."
"Girl and the goat is truly worthy of all the praise. Somehow my girlfriend was fortunate enough to nab a 630 reservation on a Monday night and we finally got to eat here. Our server was awesome giving us suggestions on how to order.We started with the kohlrabi salad which was the first time I've ever had an Asian inspired dish with cheese in it. The cheese was subtle and the salad fresh and flavorful. Wouldn't order again though.The tortone was house made sourdough with cream cheese and pepita spread. It was solid but it was nothing compared to the onion bread dish which is a brioche bread. It is crispy on the outside kind of like a muffin and combined with the butter and sweet chutney, it was one of my favorites.We got the escargot ravioli. And for 15 dollars you only get 4 ravioli which is kind of a bummer. The snails were tender with a nice light chew, and the bacon sauce with wonton crisps on top provided a savory crunch.Next came the infamous pig face which was truly like bacon on steroids as another yelper mentioned. It was thicker, softer and more tender than my normal bacon experience. With the egg on top mixed in, it was a winner.Final main course dish was the duck tongue. The tongue was cut and fried into small pieces. Each bit was light airy and fried perfectly. Mixed with the black bean and tuna sauce, it was a great way to finish off the main course.Save room for dessert! The butterscotch budino is one of the best desserts I've had. I don't even know what a budino is, but it was like whipped butterscotch pudding-Amazing. The plantain cake was wonderful too!Girl and the goat is awesome. I'll be eating onion bread and pig face in my dreams until the next visit."
"I made reservations about a month & a half in advance. I'd been here before so I knew to be prepared with a reservation :)My favorite dish to get here is definitely the CRISPY PIG FACE! So. amazingly. delicious. They do such a great job of combining contrasting textures and flavors. When I look for a crazy good meal, I'm all about texture and almost every dish I've ever had here has been done just right.My other two really close favorites are:-Escargot ravioli (my friends didn't like it bc of the idea of it, but I LOVED it. More for me.)-Cauliflower with pine nuts (Lots of flavor)If you're going to Chicago, make a reservation way in advance. Then get there early and have drinks at the bar and their comfy waiting lounge."
"I only had one night in Chicago, and one restaurant to answer all my questions of the city's palate. Â We came in for a late, late dinner at 10:30 pm and the place was still brimming with conversation and delectable scents, the decor rustic yet classy. We get seated, our waiter was friendly and very professional- I was the only one allergic to gluten in our party of four and he managed to answer all our questions quickly and effectively. Â We went with the roasted beet salad, cauliflower, wood oven pigface, braised pork shank, and goat belly, all which I could expand on but I won't because...My personal highlight of the night: THEIR GLUTEN FREE BREAD. It's what drove me to this review. I've been gluten free for a few years now, and have tried lots of different breads and even experimented in the kitchen....there's been many contenders, but nothing like the real thing. Their gluten free bread was seriously the most delicious gf bread I've tasted.I haven't enjoyed bread like that in a long time. Perfect start to what was a lovely and savory meal.A hearty refuge from the winter storm, thanks Girl & Goat for making my one night in Chicago so memorable."
So glad that I did my research before arriving in Chicago so that I could try this great restaurant! Â Really loved the whole setting and our server was great. Â My favorite way to eat is shared plates and I was thrilled to get to taste so many different items. Â My two fav's were the Chickpea Fritters and Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. OMG - fabulous!!
"Girl & the Goat is flawless! My husband and I came here on a Friday night and were seated immediately (with a reservation). The service was outstanding and the food cannot be beat. We ordered a TON and were not disappointed. As other reviews mention, you have to try the pigs face. It is super rich and unlike any flavor I've had before. We also had the miso bread with chipotle butter to start. It came with this amazing blueberry sauce that was to die for. The duck tongue with tuna and baby octopus was also amazing. We made the clean plate club on every single thing we tried. This place is perfect for an anniversary or date night. I have to say, the duck empanadas were just OK. This is one of their most popular menu items and while they were defiantly good/perfectly cooked, they tasted like many other empanadas I've had in the past. They also pack it in pretty tight at the restaurant. We were less than an arms length away from the tables on both sides of us, which I didn't mind too bad, but if you like more privacy/a quiet environment for dinner I would choose a different place. 5 stars for Girl & the Goat! This is now our go-to wedding gift to Chicago couples. We will be back!"
"Believe the hype. Â The food is on point. Â I don't need to give a long review - read the 3,000+ already on here. Loved the chickpea fritters and mussels and cauliflower and fried oysters. Don't get the shisito peppers unless you have a large group (too many in the serving for just 2 people).Had to deduct one star for service. As others have stated, you order everything at once and then the server/kitchen decides the order and pace of service. Â We got our first 3 items quickly, perfectly spaced out. Then had a big lag, with no waiter check in. Â So much so that I finished my wine and wasn't able to order a second glass - even though my husband and I were looking around for our waiter (and the guy shadowing him). Â Sort of unexplainable for a Tuesday night after 8:30pm."
"This is a really special place. Everything that comes to your table is a gift from the food gods. There was nothing but happy eaters at my recent birthday dinner. The server was very helpful and steered us towards good choices. I am a vegetarian and thought I might have a hard time but the veggie options were to die for. I had the grilled broccoli, the chickpea fritters, and the shishito peppers. The feta and hummus bread was soo good but next time I would order at least 2 servings. One is not enough and when it is gone you will wish another was on its way. My friends (meat eaters) had the goat empanadas, the country fried loup de mer, and the scallops. They loved all of it. Would return for a special occasion or when in town and wanting to treat myself. A really nice dining experience. The open kitchen is fun and contributes to the lively atmosphere."
"Absolutely amazing food. The decor is well done; not quite over the top, but very unique.The food is some of the best I've ever eaten. Make sure you get the pig face, and the goat belly."
"Never have I had such excellent service, delicious food, and in such an intimately cool atmosphere. Really loved having the hostess with the curly dark hair like mine. She was super sweet and friendly. Everyone and everything was perfect. Thank you for making my birthday so special."
"Green bean is the best one, cauliflower is tasty also, love their dessert, they are must have!"
"For such a long wait to get in this was totally worth every penny and the time. Everyone that works there that helped us was above and beyond excited to serve us and work there, Bravo!"
"Great food, great drinks and a great atmosphere! Definitely make reservations!"
"Girl & The Goat I made a reservation for you nearly a month in advance and it was well worth the wait. For a table of two the only reservation left the week I was in town was 10:45PM on Tuesday or Wednesday... It was take my pick but I didn't care because I knew I had to try it. When in Chicago... right? We got there around 10:15 for our 10:45 reservation on tuesday and was seated right away. A pleasant surprise. Everything went smoothly and we were on our way to eating some delicious food. Here's what we ordered:Not Campbell's (4/5) Falafel (5/5)Kona Kamapachi Crudo (5/5)Diver Scallops (3.5/5)Wood Fired Walter's Chicken (5/5)Apple Buckle (4/5)Miso butterscotch budino (5/5)Overall 5/5 stars. Diver scallops were a little too rich for me but the cook on the scallops were amazing. Quality control is definitely taken seriously here. Some dishes worked for me and some didn't but that's just personal preference. IMO Dessert was alright but the things that stood out like the butterscotch were seriously amazing. Girl & The Goat has ruined food for me, and in the worst/best way possible. That is I can't eat anything and not compare it to G&TG. I mean really though, how am I supposed to go on eating regular food after eating G&TG?"
"Ok so either this place is way overrated or I had my expectations set way too high.I made reservations months ago after hearing how amazing it is and how hard to get rez. Â Well the day finally came and.....not all that impressed sorry!We tried to order one from each category: got the rye bread- averageGoat empanada- it was good, all components, so ok but just oneRoasted cauliflower- prob the highlight of the menu honestlyRoasted duck with the kimchee- yuck, sorryWe didn't want to end on that note so we got dessert, one was a hit one was a miss.The rhubarb cake was amazing I will say. They have it in this horachata tapioca- wow. So good I would go and just order that next time. Â Then it ordered the date cake with the butter gelato- no. A total miss. Wish I didn't end on that note.My friend and I agreed that Little Goat across the street is probably better than here and you don't have to fuss with advance reservations!Sorry- I'm a foodie and I was expecting so much better. Â Or maybe I need to try other items but didn't look like I was missing out on much else.I will say, our bill was decent even though we ordered quite a bit. Â But anyway I look forward to Little Goat next time. And maybe here for the rhubarb dessert."
"Amazing food, great service, and fantastic atmosphere. The only downside is not having an extra stomach to enjoy everything the menu. My friend and I annually come here when she visits and then, as well as every time I've stopped in between, the service is always great."
I loved it here. One of the first restaurants my bf and I ate at together in Chicago. We had the oysters three way and a few other dishes. I still remember those oysters! We didn't have reservations and they were super accommodating about seating us. Everything we had here from the starters to our cocktails was terrific. It also was toasty which is important in Chicago!
I'm going to keep this short. Tapas style dishes and everything is good. Everything. You want to go to here.
"Eating at G&G is a Chicago experience that cannot be missed. Saturday night; we didn't make reservations so we put our name on the wait list and sat at the bar for a little over an hour (full menu is available at the bar). The bartenders and hosts were incredibly friendly and helpful. The bar environment encourages communication and food envy with fellow patrons in a pleasant fashion. Everyone seemed to be enjoying their wait or their meal. We reviewed the menu while at the bar and decided what to order with input from the bartenders and fellow patrons. We feasted on (in order of most loved):- pig face: easily the best thing we ordered, should not be overlooked notwithstanding the name. - pork loin: crispy skin was delicious. - cauliflower (tied with loin): highly recommended by bartender and was very, very good. - hamachi crudo: small portion but well paired with the pork belly. - goat empanadas (gf felt that empanadas trumped crudo, just sayin): we had to try some goat, wasn't as flavorful as expected and crust was not flaky enough. Nonetheless it was good. - apple buckle (simply desert, not included in rankings)Staff was unbelievably friendly. We had a fabulous time. The hype is well deserved."
"I went here about a month ago and I'm anxiously waiting to go back. The atmosphere is wonderful- how do they manage to make you feel like you're in a small town restaurant yet classy at the same time? And I had a great view to watch Stephanie Izard in the kitchen (open kitchen). We only made reservations a few weeks earlier. (Call, they have a lot more tables than it says on opentable).I ordered several dishes - they were ALL amazing. However, the only thing I remember is the pig face. This is not because the other items weren't good- it's just that the pig face was so insanely good. Don't worry it doesn't look like a face. In total, my boyfriend and I shared four items -I wish my stomach was bigger because I was painfully full. Maybe don't get four meat dishes like we did and you'll be okay. Just Go. And make sure you try pig face and goat."
"I really liked Girl & The Goat and would surely return when in Chicago again. Fabulous, energetic, buzzing atmosphere with friendly staff at every turn.We arrived on time for our 745P rez (made via OpenTable a night or two prior). Our table wasn't ready so we grabbed a couple seats at the bar, before we could finish our drinks the hostess had come to let us know they were ready to seat us.As first timers we ordered some of the more popular menu items:- Roasted Cauliflower (pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint) Â delish!!! - SautÃ©ed Green Beans (fishâ sauce vinaigrette, cashews)  Â  the fish sauce is quite flavorful but may be a little much for some palettes- Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix) Â  the mix and mash concept of the pig face with the sunny side egg was fun, the thought of these two words ""pig face"" are what inevitably prevented me from finishing this dish, tasty nonetheless!- Goat Empanadas (marinated sheep feta, pickled golden beet, tzatziki) Â Simply delish! Great texture and flavor- Bread w/ Spelt grain Â  too heavy - pass! Unless you show up shit faced and are looking for the absorption factor- Scallops (sweet curry, sweet onion-bacon, papadum) Â  sampled these from the kitchen but didn't order. Tasty! but not sure I'd need an entire order, may be too much unless you really like scallopsThe cauliflower and goat empanadas were my fav out of the above.Great beer/wine and cocktail menu.Skipped dessert because we were too full from the above and a couple drinks.Restrooms downstairs were tidy, valet was helpful and got us into a cab within seconds of exiting.Great place! the entire vibe reminds me very much of one of my most fav restaurants in LA. Tapas style dining is always a good time!"
"Anything in this restaurant that is fatty enough to give you a heart attack is amazing. Just swallow. The bread, oh the bread. Each of them comes with a specific dipping source. The source is like the bread's soul mate. They are meant to be together. It's that matching. Pork belly is really tiny. There were like three drops of pork meat. Each of them was about the size of my nail. But they tasted delicious! And the pig face. Damn the pig face. The pig face was the reason that I only had the capacity for one dessert at the end. My colleague and I were in Chicago for a three-day conference. We decided to leverage every single meal we could possibly have in the windy city. Girl & the Goat was our first spot after landing. It was a great starter."
"Great service! We loved our waiter - it was a very busy night and he took time to talk to us about the city (we just moved here). Had wonderful recommendations and went through the menu thoroughly. The food, however, didn't live up to the hype or our expectations. We got 7 different dishes and didn't find any of them truly remarkable. We left saying everything was ""okay"" and feeling we spent too much money."
"I guess I do not get it, or I am a little jaded. I do not call myself a foodie, but I have dined out allot and allot of places. Girl and the Goat is definitely a place that has to be experienced, and the chef/owner deserves every bit of the praise she has gotten. My girlfriend had been there before as had our other couple. She was not keen on returning, but I made her, because I had not been. The room is causal, vibrant and busy. The hostesses are pleasant and inviting. The wait staff is personal and attentive, and everything is crack professional. The food is hit and miss. The 4 of us had 8 shared plates. The halibut was the best I have eaten. The scallops were great. Fritters were OK, the skirt steak tough and OK, the pig face was interesting and good, but I would never order again, and the lamb stuffed calamari was god awful. Someone was definitely Â having a 420 afternoon when they shoved some lamb into some scrap squid laying around and called it a dish. lamby and fishy at the same time. Beer selection is good, as are the drinks. All in all, expensive and you will leave hungry. Dinner for 4, $246."
"Love: - extensive cocktail/wine/beer list- knowledgable and attentive waitresses - their dishes are tapas sized and sharable - menu is divided by veggies, meat, seafood, etc - I love my cider- PIG FACE - with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix. They instruct you to destroy it completely to oblivion...- ARCTIC CHAR! - SCALLOPS!- Goat carpaccio was not gamey and was surpringly tasty- DUCK TONGUES! SO GOOOOOOD. I still dream about it. - Save room for dessert -- gelato, cheese galoreIf you know you're going to Chicago, make reservations ASAP! lifeonmacro.wordpress.coâ¦"
Highly recommend the goat empanadas and pig face. Â The taco bread and beet salad were average. Overall good experience but kind of over priced and the portions were small.
Loved this place! My party of 3 walked in at 2230 to try our luck and surprisingly got seated immediately!! Â Our server was very friendly and gave great tips. Â My favorite dish was the Pig Face. Â Mmmm....just thinking about it makes my mouth water. Â I also enjoyed the roasted cauliflower and goat empanadas. Â Will definitely be back again!!
AMAZING! My husband and I had been trying to get reservations here for the last two years when we visited Chicago. Finally on this trip we got an early reservation . . . we walked in and were taken to the chef's table. Â This was two seats with a bird's eye view of the kitchen. Â I don't know where to start with my raving about how fabulous the food and service were! We had the beet salad that melted in our mouths. Â The waitress then sent us a mini goat empanada. Â I will get the full order next time. Â Every dish we had was better than the next. Â I have nothing but compliments and hope to get to go again soon!
"Polar Vortex 1 was the best thing I could have asked for the day of flying back to Chiberia from California for one reason. No reservation dinner at Girl & the Goat.Best meal we have had in a while, this restaurant is unquestionably phenomenal.Obligatory roasted cauliflower, grilled octopus, lamb ribs, goodies from the goat menu, specialty breads, all amazing... no further suggestions are needed because I'm sure everything on their menu is incredible!!!"
"Amazing service, awesome atmosphere, delicious beverages and tasty food. If you're going there on a date request the chef's table, well worth it."
Finally made it to this hot spot in Chicago and I have to say I could have skipped it Â  It is way overrated Â  The food was just ok and far too expensive for what it was Â  Â Neither my friend of I loved any of the dishes we had Will not go back Â  So many better places in this amazing city
"I went in on Thursday for a date night with my hubby. Â We arrived about 5:30 and were seated immediately (they told us we had to be gone by 7:15, but that was more than enough time for us). Â I haven't been here in a long time because my first experience here wasn't exactly stellar. Â This experience was probably worse, but I spent less money this time so I wasn't quite as upset. Â I don't get this place. Â Seeing all these rave reviews really shocks me because I don't think the food is that great. Â Yes, there are weird things combined together, but that doesn't great food make. Â For me the food is just ok, the service is terrible, the ambiance is ok (minus the microscopic tables). Â If the tables need to be pulled in and out for people to go to the bathroom that means there's to many tables crammed in there. Â Anyways about the food, we had the apple smacks bread which was actually delicious with both of the accompanying spreads and for me was the highlight of the meal. Â We also had the goat empanadas which were my second favorite and the sweet goat cheese wontons and the Skatewing which were just ok at best. Â The service was horrendous, I had the three in one cocktail to drink which was ok, but not great. Â The waiter took forever to bring that and my drinks. Â Then he disappeared before we could even order. Â When he came back he commented about how he had been away forever. Â Duh! Â It wasn't really an apology, but more of a statement of the obvious. Â This was frustration since we had been given a time limit by the restaurant and our waiter was moving at a snail's pace. Â Overall, I will not be back. Â I like little goat and I will patronize that restaurant but this one is just not for me."
"We had a very enjoyable meal as a party of four. Vibe is energetic and a bit noisy. Food comes out fast once you order but not all at once. The plates are shareable and I'd suggest getting a variety to sample. Our highlights were the:1. Pork shank - delicious and plenty for everyone to eat. 2. Pig face - waiter said it was popular. Pretty much fancy bacon and eggs. 3. Green beans - simple and tasty4. Goat appetizer special - if you go there, you should at least order one goat dish. Make reservations or you could be waiting a long time. It's very busy. And for good reason. Excellent food!"
"Absolutely fantastic! Came in with high expectations and definitely was not disappointed. Was able to get reservations for a Friday night a week before, apparently that's pretty rare, and I can see why! The atmosphere was very nice. Classy, yet casual feel to the place. The service was fantastic! Everyone was so attentive and never let an empty glass or finished plate sit for too long. Something I really enjoyed was how one plate was brought out after another, and not all at once, and when they brought a plate, they would tell you exactly what was in it.Now to the best part.... THE FOOD. Everything we had was phenomenal! For four people, our waitress recommended seven or eight plates, which ended up being the perfect amount because everything comes as ""small"" plates to share. Here's what we ordered:Miso Hungry Bread: Great way to start! The bread was so fresh and warm and paired perfectly with the pickle relish.Squash Blossom Ragoons: Really great flavor. The crisp outer shell went together perfectly with the soft, warm crab filling. The almonds were a nice addition in flavor.Could have done without the green goddess sauce, though. Spring Onion Pot Stickers: These were really good as well. There was a perfect filling-to-dough ratio.Ham Frites: I'm not a fan of french fries, so I didn't try this one, but the other members of my group said they tasted like french fries with bacon, but better. Oven-Roasted Pig Face: Oh boy. This was amaaazing! The crispiness of the pork with the creamy texture of the egg made for a heavenly combination. I read a couple of reviews that said this dish was too salty, but I didn't think so at all.Roasted Cauliflower: Probably the best tasting cauliflower I've ever had. Seasoned perfectly and roasted so it was soft, but not mushy. Grilled Skirt Steak: It was grilled to perfection, but the sweet cherry tapenade made this dish great. It's funny because they are two flavors you woudn't expect to work well together, but gosh was it great. Pork Shank: My favorite of the night, hands down. Melt-in-your-mouth delicious! I could have eaten this whole thing by myself. For dessert, the rest of my table ordered the bittersweet chocolate and loved it! The chocolate mousse, blackberries, brownie, and basil-chocolate chip gelato paired together quite nicely. We will definitely be coming back to try the other dishes!"
"I was so excited to go here for the first time, and was devastated when 2/5 of my dishes were so unappetizing that they were not even worth eating, and i wasn't even inspired to ravenously finish my dessert. The pig face, however, was great. Too much hype, not enough great food. Next time, i'm going to publican instead."
"Absolutely stunning. The food. The ambiance. The service. It's no wonder that this is Chicago's top 5 reviewed restaurants. It's best to make a reservation here a week in advance if you want a table. If you're just with a small group and don't have a reservation, arrive promptly when they open at 4:30. The entire restaurant and bar gets packed by 5:30. I would definitely recommend the Hamachi Credo if you like hamachi (sashimi style) to start off with. So many good dishes. And if you like beer, get the Rogue's Hazelnut. Best beer. Ever. Ask your server or bartender for food recommendations. They're all pretty friendly and know their stuff. Expect to pay about $35 to $60 per person on food alone. Definitely worth every dollar though. Just arrive early roger a reservation!"
"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the states. I would've never thought I'd enjoy something with the words ""pig"" and ""face"" in one sentence, especially when those two words are right next to eachother, but let me tell you, if I met Piglet and Eeyore one day, Eeyore would be PISSED 'cause I'd have just eaten his buddy's face off."
"I put in a reservation for Girl & the Goat about a month ahead for a late night (8:45) dinner. I had heard so many good things about this place and, for someone who cooks at home a lot, decided to treat myself with a night off. After reading several reviews, I wasn't surprised to see how busy it was in the restaurant on a Tuesday night. My first thought was, wow--the servers must make BANK at this place. Our own server greeted us, but she never told us her name. She was really knowledgeable about the menu, including the beer and wine. She explained that 4-5 dishes for two people are typical, so we went in that direction. We started out with the honey sambal brioche with honey butter and pomelo fresno relish. This bread was delicious--made with sour cream and melt-in-your-mouth good. Then we tried the pan-fried shishito peppers with Parmesan and sesame and the wood-grilled broccoli with bleu cheese and crispies (AKA Rice Krispies). Â Again, really good. And you get A LOT. We skipped on the seafood options this time around and opted for the roasted duck breast and the confit goat belly. While I found the duck breast to be too salty, the goat belly was my absolutely magical. With rich bourbon butter and lobster and crab, you really can't go wrong. Usually I find belly to be too chewy/fatty, but seemed to have the texture of a short rib. By the time we tried everything, we were too full for dessert. For two people that have big appetites, we ordered too much food. Our server had suggested 4-5 dishes, but had we known that the veggie plates are generous portions, we would've cut back or not ordered the bread. I see us returning to Girl & the Goat sometime in the future to try the infamous pig face."
"CHICAGO: I was excited to come here! Â Fun, packed ambience. Â Pretty loud but it was part of the charm, and there were a ton of people here, no one to blame. Â Small dishes meant for sharing. Â I took recommendations from the server.I had the goat empanadas (5 stars) with feta, tziziki and pickled strips. Â Delicious. Full of flavor, warm, a mixture of textures and really complex.The cauliflower (3 stars) is the most popular vegetable, with Parmesan and pine nuts. Â It was complex and flavorful, but tasted too much of rye and had an unappealing aftertaste. Â It just wasn't happening for me.The Pig Face (4 star) is equally popular: a fancy take on ham, egg, and hash brown. Â It was good, but not more so than getting a hash at a great breakfast restaurant. Â Just yummy hash browns with ham and egg!Escargot ravioli is awesome (5 stars) brown butter and crispy onions with yummy pasta. Â Extremely savory, craveable, and memorable. Â I'm excited to have it again.Looking forward to the next visit!"
This restaurant is very good and their quality of food is excellent but however they do overprice their food by a lot. I don't think it's worth the type of food they serve and the amount of food that you get that's for sure. If you don't care how much you pay for food but are looking to get some samples of good quality food this is your spot.
"Finally. Waited for 2 months and still the only slot available was 9:30 a Tuesday night. Despite awkwardly long reservation times, I was thrilled (and hungry!) when we finally made it there. Although we arrived on time, our table was not ready and so we waited in the bar with a cocktail. Had my usual lemon drop martini which, to my disappointment, was made without sugar rim. But perfectly tart and for sure made with real lemon juice.We went on to pick 5 courses to share among the two of us. Nothing was bad, and one course was outstanding: a goat with bourbon butter and lobster. The sauce was to-die-for and we even found ourselves pouring the remaining vegetables on the plate to cover then with that beautiful flavor... Without embarrassment. The lobster, however, was to my taste quite abundant.One other course I remember was wood oven roasted pig face which without doubt was delicious, but would have suited way better as a hung over breakfast a late Sunday morning.I probably wont go back since I find it ridiculous to wait for a table for two months. But, if it wasn't for that. Sure, why not."
"Great ambience! Â Was expecting the restaurant to be more low key and intimate but I loved the lively atmosphere and music. Â Surprisingly, Â it's a place where lots of friends and colleagues get together for a bite and drinks. Â Seating was definitely tightly squeezed in together. Food is small plate but delicious. Â I would recommend at least 5 dishes for 2 if you're hungry. Â Average small plate is about $16 for meat dishes and $10 for veggies. As for the dessert, the sticky date cake is something I wouldn't normally order, but it was amazing! Service was excellent from the hostess, to the waiter, and everyone else!"
My BF took me here for my birthday because I am a big Top Chef fan and have wanted to come here for almost 10 years and though the build up was large it didn't disappoint. Everything was lovely and indulgent. Definitely not where you want to go for a light meal but that's not my style. No complaints.
"We got so lucky - it was 3 of us and we were quoted a 1 hour 10 minute wait. We walked around outside for about 5 minutes and returned back to the restaurant to settle in for the long wait. Less than 10 minutes later, we were able to be seated at one of the large tables in front of the kitchen and had a great view of the hustle and bustle. This luck doesn't affect my rating - I just had to brag that we came without a reservation and had less than a 10 minute wait!Girl & the Goat is solid - everything is very good and some of awesome. But, I don't get blown away by the whole meal , which is the reason for the 3-star review.What we got:Bread with mushroom soup and tomato ""dips"" - AMAZING, and surprisingly so. The bread the thick and does taste like broccoli cheese. The mushroom soup ""spread"" is heavenly. I'd love to have this all day, every day.Cauliflower - very great play on some different flavors. I can see why this is so popular; it's a solid vegetable dish and different from a basic cauliflower dish.Escargot Ravioli - the miso-tamarind sauce is great, but where was the bacon? And the actual ravioli didn't taste like anything - literally it was like I was chewing on dough. The ravioli needed to have it's own flavor, especially stuffed with Escargot. It shouldn't be carried by the sauce.Goat Belly - Surprisingly, Goat Belly is not at all like pork belly - it's drier and more like a brisket. It was nice to find chunks of lobster in the sauce, but the flavor didn't really stand out. This dish was pretty unassuming.Pig Face - The meat is more like pork belly and is cooked very well - the pork is super tender (or fatty?!). Nothing was wrong with the dish, but like a few others, the flavor was just kind of dull. I did like the potato stix though! I have a sneaky suspicion people like this dish because of it's name. Dessert was a miso-butterscotch budino - this was delicious and I don't even crave sweets or really like butterscotch! It was a perfect balance of custard and bread-pudding-like texture. I couldn't really tell what was bacon or pineapple, but I think the flavors just all complimented each other so well that it tasted like one cohesive dish.In writing this review, I think I've realized what my general issue is with Girl & the Goat: the flavors are great and creative, but a little dull. I could use a little more flavor explosion like I got with the bread. Maybe my taste buds are just dulled :( It's good and I'll bring out-of-town visitors in since it's such a popular restaurant, but this isn't one of my go-to places. But, Little Goat is OUT OF THIS WORLD..."
"You will not get a reservation unless you call light years in advance. Â But 10:15pm is usually open but note, the kitchen will rush your food out because they all wanna go home by 11:15. Â There are cabs parked outside to take you home if you don't have a car. Â Warning, this is a very gluttonous eating. Â Prepare yourself for fatness and high cholesterol. Â I came here because of all the hype and was some what let down. Â There were just so many fried items, aiolis, and bread on the menu. Â Maybe I just ordered wrong. Â All my dishes came w/ some sort of bread/pita/crumpet, 2-3 different aiolis, and a fried component. Â Anybody can put an aioli together and toss everything in the fryer... Towards the end, my stomach yearned for some healthy salad or vegetable to soak up all the oil and fat I just consumed. Â Just go and see for yourself but if you're in for variety and timely, well executed meal, go check out The Purple Pig. Â It's out of this world."
"On my second visit, I've figured it out.Girl & the Goat's formula is this...Bland food + Powerful sauces = HypeVirtually every dish on the menu is tasteless, unless you soak it in whatever butter, sauce or syrup comes on the plate. Â To me, that's a failure. Â It's almost like the kitchen was out of spices, oils or marinades.I even took a stab at the famous pig face... and it tasted... like nothing.The broccoli tastes like it was soaked in water that had been filtered through a campfire. Â ""Extra carbon with your veggies, sir?""The ham frites were an awesome concept - fries garnished with ham dust. Â But there's only so much vaporized ham you can eat before the novelty wears off.Just like my first visit, this place is *loud*. Â I simply nodded and smiled at my friend across the table. Â I hope he wasn't talking about anything sad. Â His body language didn't seem to indicate so.This emperor has no clothes. Â I'm done with this Girl and her Goat, too."
"Went there for Valentine's Day, as a surprise of course :), and I was very impressed. I was in love with every dish they brought to us. The broccoli, calamari and pigs face was one of the best meals I have ever consumed. Bam. Definitely would recommend and definitely would come back and the staff are very polite and informative."
"Quite possibly the best restaurant I've ever been to. You have to go with the Pig Face when you come here, it was outstanding and unique to anything I've had at any restaurant ever! When you come here, the wait staff usually tells you to order 3-4 things and then they'll pace it out for you in the best order to eat it. The atmosphere here is top notch for me. It's noisy, but not too loud. The kitchen is fully exposed and it's quite the experience to see all the hustling and bustling around back there. Personally, I thought the music collection here was excellent. I heard everything from old school Snoop Dogg (think Gin and Juice) to the Doors (People are Strange). Even if you disagree with me that this is a 5-star place, I'm sure you won't leave unhappy either!"
"In an attempt to take advantage of a Monday birthday, the boyfriend and I came by G&TG around 6:15. When I asked how long the wait was, the answer I received is that we could be seated right away, if we were done by 7:45 for a previously made reservation. Um, yes I can easily be done eating in an hour and a half and NOT WAIT at Girl and the Goat! So we were seated immediately. It was magical.Our waitress came over promptly and took our drink order. I went with the Old Fashioned and the boyfriend ordered a Bolt Action, complete with bourbon, lemon, angostura, and who knows what else. Both drinks were incredibly delicious. At G&TG, you order everything at once and they course it out for you. The timing was perfect as was the order of the items. To start, we went with their tomato bread that came with a fresh green onion cream cheese and tomato oil. Both the bread and the spreads were fantastic, definitely recommend ordering one of these as they rotate seasonally. We also went with the soft shell crab with corn elote and confit goat belly. Both were incredibly unique dishes and very well-prepared. You may be tempted to overlook them, but ordering veggies at Girl and the Goat is a must as well. We went with the green beans and were not disappointed. Favorite dish of the night had to be the pig face. I can't even tell you what's going on in this dish, but the components gel together perfectly and in my book, it's a must order.We rounded out the night with the bittersweet chocolate dessert that came with (obviously) bittersweet chocolate, basil chocolate chip gelato, and blackberries. The gelato legitimately tasted like fresh basil and complimented the tart berries and sweetness of the chocolate. I'm not sure how Stephanie Izard puts together these creations, but she absolutely rocks. I know G&TG is ""small plates,"" but be aware it can get expensive for a full meal and drinks for two. However, 100% worth it. Overall, we were blown away by every dish, every cocktail, the atmosphere, and the service."
Dined here while on a business trip to Chicago. I absolutely LOVED IT!!!! The menu is quite eclectic and I LOVE how the portions are for sharing. I can't wait to get back to Chi-town and have another go
"One of the best spots in Chicago. Â The food is great, unique and reasonably priced. Â Winning combination"
"Simply amazing. It is not an understatement to declare that every dish hits every note of a wonderful and well-balanced dish that is only achieved by great chefs. Recommendations:-Roasted Cauliflower Â is a must try. It comes with picked peppers, pine nuts, and mint. Crunchy, salty, savory, and delicious. Nutty, minty, perfectly cooked-Sugo, similar to braised beef gravy over pappardelle-Crisp braised pork shank: Dressed in buttermilk and served with grilled spring onion kimchee and deliciously naan. Meat was very tender. Roasted Pig Face: this dish is to be celebrated and a must try. A dish I want to try everytime. Super tender meat, Wood Grilled Broccoli: rogue smokey blue, spices crispiesGrilled Baby OctopusPan Roasted Halibut - cooked to perfection earthy smoky, sweet savory. Another must order. Braised Beef Tongue - salty crunchy sour from the pickled vegetable, herby...Miso butterscotch budino - bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, candied cashews."
"Finally I made it to Girl & the Goat. I've heard so much about this restaurant and I lucked out finding a 6:30 PM Wednesday night reservation a week and a half earlier. The ambiance is great! Lively and energetic. You can tell people are excited to be there and are having a good time. I'll just rate all the dishes my friend and I shared in order of preference.A+++ - Pig Face - This is the staple dish and my GOD IT IS WORTH IT! If nothing else go to the restaurant, sit at the bar and order this one dish. There was quite a bit of meat (not really a tapas size in my opinion, more like an appetizer) but it just MELTSSSSSS in your mouth. I was embarrassing my friend because I just kept saying, ""Omg... omg!!!"" Literally the whole time.  - Goat Belly - This was also a MAJOR YES! It is another dish that you should go to the restaurant and if nothing else order this dish! I believe there was crab meat mixed in with some butter but it also just melts in your mouth. A rich complex flavor in my opinion. Delicious!!!A- - Jack'o'Lantern Bread - To be honest I didn't get the concept of ordering bread. I have never experienced that another restaurant but it was kind of fun! It's a great way to start the meal. The different toppings and butter made it fun and it's a good size for 2 - 3 people to share.B - Goat Liver - This is a HUGE portion in my opinion. You get five crumpets which are like five big biscuits and about half a cup of the goat liver puree. It was a good dish, lived the flavor of the GL but it was just too much food for us at that point in our meal. We only finished about 2.5 of the crumpets. I'd recommend this as an appetizer for a group of 5!B- - Chickpea Fritters - Did not understand the hype on this one. It was good but it was not great. I mainly liked the tomato and cheese mixture that accompanied the chickpea fritters.Overall I'd go back for the Pig Face, Goat Belly and Jack'O'Lantern bread and try a few other dishes to see what else I like. :)"
"Not sure is was worth the 2 hour wait, the Girl and the Goat certainly seems to be the ""it"" place in Chicago. Â We ordered the chickpea fritters, beef tongue, loup de mer, roasted broccoli, and budino for dessert. Â Beef tongue ended up being a true miss, served with tortilla crisps that were no longer crisp and rather soggy. Â We had to send back the broccoli, as all 4 of us agreed that it had a chemical smoke flavor that was very off putting. Â Highlights were the chickpea fritters and the budino. Â We just don't think that this place lives up to all the hype."
"I don't know how they do it! This place was amazing! My father and I walked right in and got seated at a communal table. We love the concept if communal seating, because we love to interact with the locals and chat with them about the area. We ordered Paloma's to drink, and they were awesome! Instead if rimming the glass with salt, they add a little salt right into the drink! Brilliant! We shared small plates including the green beans, scallops and Arctic char. All amazing dishes! Those green beans deserve an award! The flavors! Just delicious! Service was great, and the atmosphere was awesome!"
"WOW. Where do I start?!I was visiting my friend who moved to Chicago from Miami this past Labor Day weekend and she suggested we go to dinner at Girl & the Goat. She made reservations on Saturday and the only available seating was at 5:00PM. We got seated promptly and were attended by the nicest server (wish I remembered her name). She took our cocktail order while my two friends and I debated what to order.Our server suggested her favorite dishes and we took some of her recommendations. We ended up ordering the summer tom bread, roasted beets, goat cheese and sweet corn dumplings, grilled baby octopus, pan roasted halibut, wood oven roasted pig face (overhyped) and the goat empanadas. For dessert, we ordered the peaches and blueberry buckle with goat cheese gelato (SO good) and our server delivered us the miso-butterscotch budino on the house! (Thank you!)Plate after plate we were in awe of how delicious everything was. Easily, one of the best meals I have eaten in the past years; a true culinary adventure.Stand out dishes were the goat empanadas and the halibut (best fish I've ever had, hands down).This place is a MUST if you are visiting Chicago. Incredible food, trendy vibe and attentive staff. LOVED IT!"
"Visited Chicago last weekend and we had to try this place. We had no idea we will be in Chicago last week so didn't get to make a reservation. We waited about an hour and half and it was totally worth it. We had pig face, Â and goat belly as main. We also had green beans and cauliflower as side. It was one of the best dishes I've ever had! Service was spot on. Everything was perfect"
"Perfect spot for a special night out, hip but nothing obnoxious. Loved every dish that came to us--perfectly-sized portions for two people to try something and then get to go back for a little more. Our favorites were the roasted broccoli with blue cheese and the sugo pappardelle (a three-meat ragu sauce), but each dish had something about the mix of ingredients that was a unique taste and unexpected. Our server (Jorgen?) was top notch, plates were brought out well-paced and very attentively. A great soundtrack was icing on the cake--early Jay-Z, Nirvana Unplugged, Hall & Oates covers. We're moving to Chicago this summer and Girl & the Goat has bumped the West Loop to the top of our neighborhood wish list."
The food is great though the price is a bit high. It is high end and near impossible to get a reservation at. Their beef tongue and goat belly are delicious.
"My husband took me here on a date, and we sat at the chef's table. He isn't a foodie, and even he could tell the food was above and beyond fabulous. Our favorite was the trout, but even the homemade bread was noteworthy. I so hope to return on my next trip to Chicago."
"One of the best restaurants in Chicago. Great meats (see: Pig Face), but don't sleep on the surprising veggies (Cauliflower. Really, cauliflower).Because this place is so amazing, it's fairly difficult to get in without a reservation."
"Holy f me shizzles. Where to start? Great cocktails by JUSTIN the bartender, made some gin cocktail that was spicy and sweet, perfectly balanced. Paired a glass of rose with the calamari bruschetta. Genius. We ate raw oysters, fried oysters with egg salad and capers, above bruschetta and goat belly confit with lobster and crab meat with bourbon butter (can die now). Craft cocktails were delicious! We didn't have resos and ate at the bar, which worked out just fine ;) loved it, will go back."
this place is ah-maze-ing!! be sure to make reservations weeks ahead of time. I went with a group of 6 and it was perfect. it's tapas style so I could recommend ordering a bunch of different plates and tasting each one. every plate is unique and flavorful. best experience ever. will def visit this place when I come back to Chicago. in my picture I circled what we ordered.
"My husband and I were trying to get reservations at Girl & The Goat for months to get a decent time for dinner, however whenever we checked, the only reservations available were always after 10pm even during the week. Â So finally, we decided to make our reservations two months in advance for my birthday. Â After going to dinner last night, I am SO glad we finally had dinner at Girl & The Goat. Â The experience was everything and more.Our service, food and drinks were all amazing. Â We were also pleasantly surprised how affordable it was for the quality of food that is served at the restaurant. Â We can't wait to go back! Â We ordered the below items and we absolutely loved each and every one and would easily order it again. Â Raw Kusshi OystersRoasted CauliflowerPan Roasted Arctic CharDiver ScallopsWood Over Roasted Pig FaceCrisp Braised Pork ShankMiso-Butterscotch BudinoPlantain CakeWe had an awesome server who was very knowledgeable and very nice. Â He heard it was my birthday throughout the course of our dinner and surprised me with a second dessert with a candle which was very nice. Â If you haven't already been to Girl & The Goat, make the reservation even if its a few months in advance and go! You will NOT regret it!"
"I started with the Goat Carpaccio Â (I kind of had to have something goat). Â This was a fresh, complex appetizer full of nuanced flavors and balanced textures - this is an appetizer portion for 1. Â  I followed this mild flavor profile with much bigger and bolder Â flavors that included the Shishito peppers and the Striped bass. Â The peppers arrived first; plenty to share. Â The peppers are probably too spicy for those that like mild flavors only, but for me, this was a very, very compelling dish of veggies - YUM. Â Everything about the meal so far was excellent, but the Striped Bass took the flavor profile to a new level of complexity. Â The Bass was by far the most delicious dish I've had in months.Kudos to the kitchen and thanks to the bartenders for the perfect mix of friendly service and space. Â I rarely give a 5 star rating; Girl & the Goat delivers. Â I could easily have had 8-10 different dinners and likely have been just as satisfied. Â I hope to come back soon."
"Wow just wow. This place is incredible. Came here with my gf for dinner, we made a reservation which I recommend because it gets crowded pretty quick. The place itself is pretty big and the decor is pretty nice but enough about that and let's move on to the food. We got the braised beef tongue, roasted pig face, goat carpaccio, and the goat shank. The beef tongue was cooked to perfection and it was perfectly tender and crispy on the outside. The goat carpaccio was probably the weakest dish, it was very vinegary and I didn't get a very good feel of the goat flavor from the dish. The roasted pig face was absolutely out of this world and is now one of my new favorite dishes that I could eat everyday. Seriously. Decadently rich with a nice dressing that cuts through the richness and melds perfectly with the entire dish. And finally the goat shank finished the meal off perfectly. Rich and meaty, it was fall off the bone tender and it was full of goat flavor. Absolutely cannot wait to go back to this restaurant and try more new dishes and eat more pig faces. Service was also excellent."
So good. So so so so good. And the service was absolutely fantastic. Worth every penny.
"This is one of my all time fav places to eat! Â Great vibe, professional and well trained staff and the food is AMAZING! Â The pork sandwich here is not to be missed! Â Great brunch options too!"
"Been here 3 times now and think I can give it a fair review. Â Girl and the goat was hyped up from the get go but met my expectations. A lot of great dishes but they were hit or miss. Dishes that really stood out were the grilled broccoli, escargot raviolli, the octopus, lamb ribs, Â all the raw dishes (oysters, himachi, trout tare tare).Some of the other dishes had too many flavors going on that didn't mix well or just had bacon randomly thrown on. The diver scallops were extremely salty the one time I had them. Â Breads are not essential. Just filler but the spreads for them can be nice. As for the goat dishes, not a big fan. That and the pig face are much more a novelty. Try it once and that's it. Definitely a place to go but I don't know if I'll be going back for another pass anytime soon."
"So my actual star review would be 4.5, and it comes very close to being a 5. The ambiance is great, it's lively but not overwhelming, you can definitely tell this is one of Chicago's hottest restaurants, and it does live up to the hype. We ordered 4 dishes for our meal, but abstained from cocktails and dessert (too full for dessert), the portions were good sized (especially the vegetables) and we felt it was more than enough food for two healthy appetites (I am a relatively large man and my dining companion is a petite woman). For our meats we ordered goat belly with lobster, and lamb ribs. For vegetables we ordered cauliflower and green beans. We also ordered onion bread to munch on before our meal. Both my dining companion and I agreed that the vegetables outshone the meat dishes. While the meat dishes were both very delicious, the vegetables had more exciting flavor combinations, especially the green beans which had a deliciously acidic fish sauce vinaigrette. The cauliflower was also extremely good, with great flavor and a little spice. The goat belly was tasty, with a sweet flavor and good texture. It was interesting paired with the lobster meat, I wouldn't have thought those two proteins would go together, but it worked. The lamb ribs were more disappointing. While good, they didn't pop like the rest of the meal did, and it was a little hard to eat, especially since all the dishes are made to be shared. Overall, I highly recommend this place, and think it deserves its reputation. Next time I go I definitely want to try out the dessert menu."
"I was very excited last spring to have snagged a reservation for two, as I wanted to surprise my mother who was visiting and take her here.Service was top notch. Â We were seated right away, the waitress was helpful and polite.However, I have to say that both of us walked away from Girl and the Goat a bit disappointed.We tried a lot of items, but here are the ones that stuck out the most.First, we ordered a blueberry salad which sounded amazing. Â The reality? Â A sad small bowl with a handful of spinach drowning in dressing (every piece was completely soggy) with a small sprinkling of blueberries and I believe almonds. Â We couldn't finish it, there was just so much dressing.We then tried the ham frites. Â They weren't bad. Â But they weren't all that great either. Â Just very normal, sort of salty fries with some halfway decent dipping sauces. Â We had a few other items as mentioned that were also forgettable. Â We then had the quintessential Pig Face everyone talks about. Â I mean, it was good. Â However, it just wasn't all that special. It was essentially super thin/crispy hashbrowns with pork belly and a runny egg on top with a maple sauce drizzled around the plate. Â I guess I thought it would just be more...flavorful maybe? Â Special? Â It just seemed average.Girl and the Goat wasn't my cup of tea, but I do love Little Goat Diner across the street!"
"Dined 01/15/2015 for and as we'd been trying to get a table in this restaurant for 2+ years to say we were anxious is an understatement. Â First, impeccable service (hats off to Calvin). The roasted pig face we were absolutely dying to try. I should know better trying to order any bbq pork product north of the Mason-Dixon. Â It was average at best and Im really being overly nice saying that. It came out like some sort of over cooked, read ""dry"", pork shoulder that was closer to carnitas than other thing. Unfortunately the pierogies and deserts were highlights, which shouldnt be the case in such a high-profile establishment. Â All in all this was very average overall. The dÃ©cor and service help quite a bit, but there are far better dining options in Chi-town."
"Walked in on a Wed night (10:30PM) and got seated at the bar right away. Halibut and lamb ribs were cooked to perfect doneness and tasted excellent.But can do with out the hoyty toyty PhD garnishes - almond butter with white aspargus morcora churm what??? Â Service was very friendly and beers good. But room, music, and scene too hip for this old fart that wandered in just for a midnight snack."
"We didn't have reservations so we got there about 5:30. Â We ordered drinks at the bar and because someone cancelled their reservation, we were seated at about 6:00. Â We ordered the brioche, trout and cauliflower. Â BEYOND. DELICIOUS. We are still dreaming about our meal weeks later. Â It's cool to have seen Stephanie Izard on Top Chef as well as the The Taste. Â She knows her stuff. Â She's very talented and we can't wait to return."
"4.5 stars!Super cool place, the decor is awesome, you can feel how this restaurant prides itself in it's food the moment you walk in.Notable for being excellent were: Roasted Cauliflower and the Pig Face.I did not give it the last half star because the food was extremely heavy and greasy. Considering how much fat is naturally in the meat this restaurant serves, it becomes excessive when the veggies are also bombs.But this was an excellent restaurant and great for couples on anniversaries, birthdays or other special occasions!"
"""You're going to Chicago? You HAVE to go to Girl & the Goat!""--said 9 different people when I told them I'd be in Chicago. I'm always wary about a place that gets so much hype but it's well deserved. Reservation: The only option available on a Tuesday was at 10:15PM (!) but I called them that day around 3PM and they said I could just walk in right when they opened at 4:30PM and they'd have a seat available. Note** The bar/lounge is first come first serve and serves the exact same menu as the dining room. They open at 4:30PM but we got there at 4:15PM and within 2 minutes, there were already 11 parties lining up to put their name down (or had their reservation at 4:30PM, I don't know). Anyway, this place clearly is aware of their popularity so getting seated was very easy. FOOD (mostly ordered what everyone on Yelp recommended and more..)1. Roasted Cauliflower: Good side dish, really heart. I love cauliflower so I love this dish2. Fried pig face: I wasn't expecting a lot but this is pretty damn good and worth ordering3. Goat Belly Confit: Can't come here without ordering goat. I think this was good but it wasn't very memorable to me4. Jonny Applecheesebread: They have freshly made bread and while I'm not one to be so excited about bread, it was actually really good. If you're visiting from out of town, make sure to make reservations well in advance if you want an ideal time (or be flexible and take their 4:30PM or 10:45PM reservation spots)."
Amazing experience! There were three of us and we ordered 12 small dishes and every single one was on point. The flavors were amazing and something like the roasted cauliflower would seem ordinary was extraordinary. Â Drinks were delicious. Dessert did not disappoint. Ambiance is rustic cozy. Â We raved for days.
"This place lives up to the hype. Delicious food, delicious cocktails, delicious atmosphere. If you go at 5pm and sit at the bar you do not have to worry about a wait or reservations and much preferred it there than at the tables which are quite close to each other. Â Order the broccoli. I don't know what crack they put into it but I am still dreaming about it. So delicious. Also the price is not as bad as you think honestly. I shared with my boyfriend and we paid about $80 for four plates, drinks and tip. It's so worth it. Go!"
"We had a special occasion to celebrate and made a reservation for a Tuesday night. Â It was bustling in there, for sure. Â We had a very short wait, and were seated at a great table. Â The wait staff was knowledgeable about everything from recommendation on number of plates for our table to ingredients. Â They selected a reasonable wine for us as well.I can't say enough about the food. It was simply delicious. Â Each plate had enough for a bite or two among five people, and it was perfect. Â We were able to try a good portion of the menu and walk away full. Â I did not have a dish I did not like! Highly recommend the restaurant."
"So I finally was able to eat at this restaurant because someone else was a no-show. To be honest, I was a little disappointed because this place is so hyped up you'd think you're eating gold. The atmosphere- super nice. The presentation- amazing. The taste- I wasn't so impressed. We ordered the honey bread brioche, the grilled octopus, the shrimp, the cauliflower, the chicken and the crisp pork shank. The two things that were flawless were the bread and the shrimp. The octopus was too salty, the pork shank had some sort of indian spice mix with naan as the side- so it tasted like masala, the cauliflower needed a bit more seasoning and the chicken, although did not come out as the photos posted on yelp, was decent but not extraordinary. Between girl and a goat and purple pig- I'll wait for the two hours to get into purple pig. It was an experience but will definitely be a one-time thing."
"Overall experience was pretty decent.Food: Â 3/5 Â  Truthfully, the food itself was just good but for the hype of the restaurant not great Â Aside from the great expectation that I had coming in, Â i was expecting decent portion and more elegant presentation. It is a bit overpriced. I ordered crisp braised pork shank. Â lamb ribs, and config goat belly. Confit goat belly portion was really small. It seemed like they were trying to make you order another one. Â However, it had great texture and flavor. Â Pork shank was cooked to perfection. Â But the lamb ribs was overcooked.Service: 4/5. Although it was super busy, the service was great. Â We had a waiter and its assistance waiting us. Â Atmosphere: 4/5 aside from the awful parking situation, the atmosphere is great. It does have some bizarre pictures but it is well themed to it. Â It is Not too loud."
"One of the best restaurant experiences I've ever had. No wonder they have a James Beard award + 4.5 stars on Yelp!The inside looks modern with a wooden interior, lounge chairs, open kitchen, and private bathrooms downstairs.My fiance and I came in on a Monday night around 7PM and were quoted a 1+ hour wait time. Luckily, we found 2 seats at the full service bar and opted to eat there. Justin, the bartender, was awesome. He was talkative, gave great food suggestions, and even dessert on the house! We ordered oysters, the beet salad, beef tongue, skirt steak, diver scallops, and escargot ravioli. My favorites were the Beef Tongue & the Skirt Steak which were both super tender! I wish I could have ordered more because everything on the menu looked delicious! Next time, I'll try the cauliflower and goat mousse. If you are ever visiting Chicago, this place is a must! But try to make reservations in advance!"
"This is not super vegetarian friendly. I'm not sure what everyone is talking about. They will make a few options vegetarian by request, but the menu is quite limited. HOWEVER, the few vegetarian options that they did have are DELICIOUS.I had the chickpea fritters, green garlic pierogies, and the honey sambal brioche. The bread was actually the best part. It was heavenly. I would recommended this to anyone just because everything was absolutely delicious and the flavors went so well together. The service was really great too, even though we were in the lounge as we didn't get a reservation."
Wow really great service and real good food. Remember to save room for the butterscotch desert. It was great and I don't like butterscotch.
"Girl and a Goat did not disappoint! We sat at the communal table and were able to see a variety of the dishes. The green beans were amazing, big enough to easily serve 4 or more. Don't miss the lamb shank, falling off the bone with excellent buffalo sauce. Everything we tried was delicious"
"My girlfriend and I decided to come here for dinner during the holidays and it was packed. We had to wait about an hour until we were seated but we were informed that we only had an hour and half to eat because of a previous reservation for another guest. However, the restaurant's waiting area was used as a seating area for guests who did not mind eating with other guests at the table.Ambiance: Very dim lighting with a hip atmosphere. Spacious restaurant with comfortable walk space. Decor was interesting and gave us a comfortable feeling.Service: The restaurant provides a coat check service and valet parking. Staff was attentive and offered recommendations. Halfway through our meal, we were given new plates for us to enjoy the next dishes.What annoyed me was during our wait, I was given their ""full menu"" to look at. We wanted to order an appetizer while we waited but noticed there wasn't any appetizers listed on the menu. I asked a waiter if they had any appetizers. He informed me that what I had in my hand was the ""full menu"" and that they did not have any appetizers. As soon as we were seated at our table, our waiter hands me a separate appetizer menu.Food: We started off with goat empanadas that tasted amazing. The escargot ravioli came next which was even more amazing. Then the oven roasted pig face, which was recommended by many, was just incredible. I was expecting it to taste a bit crunchy but instead I was able to easily slice the tender, juicy pig face with my fork and enjoy the great tastes. It just literally melts in your mouth. Finally the wood fired wild striped bass came and it was great but nothing could beat the pig face."
"WOW!!! This is only the one word! Our food was absolutely incredible! We were fortunate enough that we did not have to wait long to get served; however, it would be worth the wait! Honestly, I am not a very adventurous eater and was concerned that I was going to be starving by the time everyone else ate and was planning to have to just stop by somewhere when we were done! Boy was I wrong!Food courses:  Â  -Cauliflower: This was incredible, all the flavors blended so well together, I loved the banana peppers cooked in! Â  Â -Grilled Baby Octopus: I was a first timer in this arena and was very skeptical about this. It was hard to get past the curling tentacles, LOL, but I just buried them and it was amazing! Â  Â -Pork Shank: This was so tender it just fell of the bone! It was juicy and full of flavor! The pita bread that came with it was soft and the side of dip (can't recall what it was) was a perfect addition to the dish.  Â  Â -Pig Face: Now again, I was freaked out about this, but after the octopus I felt like I could conquer anything! This came with a sunny side egg and we were told to mix it all up so that it looked like hash. So after all the mixing I tried a bite and was amazed at how wonderful it was.  Â  Â -Red Flintstone Bread: This was so crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. The spread that accompanied the bread was also delicious! Â  Â -Goat Liver Mousse: I was definitely going for gold here! Why not try more at this point? Maybe it was the wine? NO, it was so delicious! The combination of the biscuits,toppings, and the mousse were awesome!Overall, I can say that I would recommend anyone going here! From the point of view of a person who does not try a lot of varieties I would tell everyone to adventure out of their comfort zone and the Girl & The Goat is the place to do it!"
"I am long overdue for updating my Girl & the Goat review after having dined here on three occasions now as well as having had the privilege of enjoying Chef Izard's cuisine at various Chicago food festivals such as the Green City Market BBQ and a few Sunday Goat Suppers (on various Sundays she holds family style dinners evolving around a different theme in the private dining room above Little Goat Bread - these are such incredibly fun experiences and the perfect end to the weekend; to find out about future events follow Chef Izard on Twitter or like Little Goat on Facebook).Tonight my wife and I were fortunate enough to dine at one of the chef's tables at Girl & the Goat; comfortable bar stools at a counter gazing directly into the kitchen. This was such an amazing experience; you could feel the heat of the wood burning grill while watching the chefs work diligently to to churn amazing dish after amazing dish and are able to interact with them (as is Chef Izard, they were such a friendly, down-to-Earth group of people).Our entire meal was fantastic. Virtually everything on the menu seemed enticing and we wanted to try it all; as such we ended up ordering far more than our server recommended and it all was so outstanding we did not leave a morsel. The biggest highlight was the fried duck tongue (if you are squeamish about organ meats this is the perfect entry dish; if you had not read what it was on the menu you would never know you were eating tongue and would just fall in love with the flavors and textures). Other favorites on the night included the melt-in-your-mouth goat loin, the decadent chickpea fritters and the miso butterscotch dessert with the most heavenly pork toffee. The two biggest complaints I generally hear about Girl & the Goat revolve around the food being too salty at times or the dishes being too busy. After three meals here I have experienced only a single dish to be too salty for my palate (and I normally am fairly averse to very salty foods). I also love that Chef Izard is daring with combining unlikely ingredients together and developing extra layers of flavor; sure a lot of dishes are rich but to me she melds ingredients masterfully, elevating the dishes and making them unique without taking anything away. The only slight negatives I can conjure for Girl & the Goat would be that during my meals where I was not at the chef's counter the regular tables are rather close together and the dining room on the noisy side - while the ambiance manages to be nice with an air of elegance alongside the energy, it is not quite on par with the cuisine that is undoubtedly worthy of top notch fine dining fare. Likewise the service while friendly is not quite as polished or personable as some of Chicago's other elite venues. Girl & the Goat despite no longer being a new venue is still packed on a daily basis and deservedly so; this is a venue where the experience matches if not exceeds the hype. The more of Chef Izard's cuisine I consume the more impressed I become and she definitely has evolved into one of my favorite chefs. In 2013 Michelin made amends and starred some deserving but previously snubbed restaurants; now Girl & the Goat is Chicago's best restaurant that is not starred (and is superior to quite a few that are); let's hope that Michelin finally awards Chef Izard a well earned star this fall.

"Amazing place!Try the pig face!!! Whatever in your mind, JUST TRY THE PIG FACE!!!!!Um... the wood fire oyster is also great. They are smoked lightly with bacon and lime. Â Smoked flavor is added at the same time the tenderness is maintained. Amazing.The chickpea fritter is good, lighter than traditional falafel.Confit goat belly is ok.We had two desserts but it was 6 months ago I really could not recall more. But I promise they are all good."
"Food 4, service 3. Service started out strong and dropped off towards the last leg of our meal. Didn't check to see how our last 2 dishes were which, is unfortunate because we didn't care for them. The water service was on point though.Between the two of us, we ordered 6 dishes. 3 apps, 3 entrÃ©es...and a 3 floyds. Â The challah bread, goat heart, and kohlrabi salad were great. Goat heart, awesome. Â Then the scallops were interesting and tasty, but the low points were the two pork entrÃ©es, Â the pig face and pork shank.The pig face. I can see how people find the texture interesting. Because it is. Crunchy, soft, buttery...but man, the salt level is out of control and there is nothing to balance it out. I tasted it but couldn't eat it. Then the pork shank...also, can see why folks might be intrigued by it. Moist, tender, crispy skin...cooked really well but again just too salty and the sauces and sides that came with it made no conceptual sense. Butternut squash kimchi, kimchi bbq type sauce, buttermilk ranch type sauce and naan. This is the kind of fusion that doesn't work because it's just confused. A Â confused dish should not cost $26. Take it off the menu until all its identity issues are figured out.By the time we faced the dessert menu, our server had stopped asking us how things were tasting. So when we passed on dessert and asked for the bill, he finally asked how we liked everything. Â So I told him basically when I wrote here, the good and the bad. For a $$$ restaurant (even $$) if you're not satisfied, there's usually an attempt to address the issue. Not here. If you don't like it, too bad.We mentally justified the last two dishes ($16+$26) as a donation to the local farmers that supply the meat and produce. Because otherwise, we would have had to deal with the bad taste of overly seasoned food and mediocre service in our minds for the rest if the week. Plus it was my birthday dinner. Bummer."
"WOW! I love this place, I really wish my stomach was big enough to try EVERY dish at this place, but since I don't have a stomach that big, I had to pick and choose wisely. :(We started with escargot ravioli, followed by ham frites, roasted cauliflower, confit goat belly, and crisp braised pork shank. There's nothing that I didn't love. Everything was delicious. The service was pretty awesome, too. Our server gave her honest opinions on which to choose when we couldn't make up our minds, she was good. Make a reservation if you can, I'm glad that I did because it would have been a painful experience when you have to wait and stare at all the good food walking past you."
"I am really terrible at remembering names, so the fact that I remember the name of our server, Taylor, really speaks measures about not only the food but the incredible service we received at the Girl & the Goat. She truly took care of us as if we were old friends. My friends and I were eating the menu with our eyes so we really tried to order everything on the menu but Taylor actually advised us to order less because she felt that it would compromise our dining experience as a whole if we overloaded. So we eliminated a couple of dishes and she tailored our courses from lightest to heaviest and sent a sommelier over to our table to suggest some wines for us. We were so vague on what we wanted for our wines since we are completely new at drinking it that I'm surprised he was able to pick a bottle for us. We basically said we want something ""funky"" after having a so called ""funky"" wine that was suggested to us by the server over at the Purple Pig (also another great Chicago joint!). He didn't bat an eye at our complete lack of knowledge, thank you sir. Perhaps it's a cliche to say it was ""so hard"" to pick a favorite but I honestly can't think of one dish I wouldn't order again. Okay maybe the broccoli but that's only because we were in a carnivorous mood at the time, not because they were cooked terribly. If I had to pick a couple of the things we ate and recommend I would go with - Diver scallops - Pig face - the pork shank In the middle of our meal we had asked Taylor about local places to grab a drink and she said she would brainstorm some places. She actually wrote down a list of places and explained the highlights to each bar.We were the last people in the restaurant and at the end of our meal, we hugged Taylor and thanked her for the best dining experience ever. It's been a couple of weeks now since our Chicago vacation and I can't stop thinking about the Girl & the Goat. I truly can say that you can't go wrong with ANYTHING you order here. I am now a disciple of Stephanie Izard and I will spread her gospel as far and wide as I can. Please eat here, and Stephanie if you're reading this PLEASE COME OUT TO LA/OC area and I promise I will single-handedly keep you in business!"
"Dinner - 10.03.14Had a rsvp for 1045pm, that I made a month ago! Â Read many great reviews and, although they don't need mine, I need to leave one...Service, from the hostess, Â to the person that sat me, the server, food runners, Â & busser, was 5 stars. Â  I started with Escargot Ravioli, which was incredible. Â  Several items are available as half orders, and that makes it so much better for single diners...Rest of dinner included Ham Frites, Roasted Cauliflower(awesome), Goat Belly(surrounded w Bourbon butter, lobster, and crab), & the Budino for dessert....it's interesting to describe, so just order it...even though I had half orders of some items, Â I made sure to take leftovers, just so I could eat dessert.Food does not take long and that was a plus. Â  If you don't have a reservation, Â the wait can be long. Â The bar is open for first-come basis. Â This place sits with the top meals I have had in my life..."
"Amazing experience. Every bite and sip was wonderful! Save room for an amazing dessert! We had a large group and the server was honest w small plate numbers, we ended up with the perfect amount for 6 people."
"Long wait to be seated; but worth it. We finished half of the bottle of a delicious Amarone while we waited. The baby octopus was perfectly prepared. I would also recommend the pork shank. I usually eat so much that I skip dessert, but G&G creates great ones. I loved their rendition of PB&J. Peanut butter ice cream, frozen jelly of some sort... Delicious!The wine list is a little limited; but they did have a bottle that worked out splendidly."
"I fell in love with Chicago one magical weekend several summers ago. Â Girl & The Goat contributed no small amount to my affection for this city.The pig's face dish stands as a monument to flavor and creativity. Â Even now, I remember mixing the yolk in so that each bite was a mind-blowing mix of crunchy texture and savory bits of meat. Â We came back the next day, with no regrets dining here twice in a 3-day weekend. Â When we let the waiter know how excited we were to be back again, they gave us an extra dessert (on top of what we had already ordered), which we certainly did not need but greatly appreciated.If I ever fly to Chicago on a whim, perhaps stumbling upon last-minute deals, it will be to come back here."
"I loved it. The place is huge, and lots going on, and yet, it just did not skip a beat."
"Loved the food (bread and spring onion butter, grilled broccoli, cauliflower and warm olives) -- truly over the top! But, our server, however well intentioned, projected the attitude that we were lucky to be eating at this restaurant instead of being the customer. Serving staff needs to be reminded that they are providing the ones selling their service and that they should be more thankful for their customers!"
"Some of the most decadent food I've eaten. Goat confit and escargot ravioli were very rich and my favorites. Service was excellent, hard to get a reservation especially on a weekend. Luckily, a friend knew someone who worked there. I would avoid waiting for bar seating especially on a weekend, it was crazy crowded."
"Came here because I heard the hype but didn't believe it. Â I am from. New York City. Â We have GREAT food. Â Since Chicago pizza really can't stand up to New York pizza , I thought this place was just hype. Â But I have to admit when I am wrong. I SKIPPED DESSERT AND WENT BACK TO TE MAIN MENU BECAUSE Â IT IS THAT GOOD. Â  I in Chicago for work so I dined alone. Â I ordered : Roasted cauliflower. Â Top top notch. It is so full of flavor. It literally Â fills your mouth with full on taste overflow ! Â  It smells like a craving you didn't know you had until just now. Â Then you taste it. Â It is full. It's salty but not too much. Â The pine nuts add a smooth nutty balance. Â And then you taste the hint of fresh mint. Â That was just the roasted Â cauliflower. I think because the cauliflower was a very taste bud overload, the next plate paled in comparison. The confit goat belt with lobar Â and crab came next. It was indeed great but when tourists is already so excited from the tasted cauliflower , anything that follows will def not compare. Â The goat belly was good, very good but it didn't blow my mind. So the waitress asks me if i would like dessert. Â I say no....gimme back the main menu! Â The best culinary decision I made in my life. Â Because I am sitting here by muskeg, I have been yelping this place. Â Talk about the duck tongue prevails. Â So that's what I order in lieu of something sweet. Â  And I was wowed ! Â The piri piri sauce was perfectly balanced - full, salty enough to bring out all the flavor! I done a lot in NYC, but this Chicago dish beats them all. Ducks tongue. Â It's so tender and mixed Â with fresh bits of tuna and died wonton strips. Â Just do it. Order one of the best dishes you'll ever have. This New Yorker will def be back at the girl and the goat. Â I can't wait for my next culinary experience here!"
"Everything was fantastic about this place. The food was delicious, the ambiance was laid back yet fun, the music selection was on point, and the service was great. The only downside to this place is reservations are hard to get. Â Since the portions were small, my friend and I ordered 6 dishes (as recommended by our server). Â Each plate was phenomenal. Â We had the chickpea fritter, roasted beeets, hamachi crudo, goat empanadas, pan seared sea diver scallops, and the beef ribs. Â We also ordered freshly baked bread and ended the night with the miso-butterscotch budino, which was heaven in my mouth,I can't wait to go back!"
This was incredible! My friends and I got a last-minute reservation and everything was great. The pates and the roasted cauliflower... just amazing!
"My favorite dinner spot in Chicago! It is worth every penny. The food was fantastic! I recommend trying the empandas, wood smoked broccoli, pig face and the shank."
"Went about 1 to 2 years ago. Great drink list! Good food. It was a little over the top with everything being cooked in the wood burning oven (kind of unnecessary, somethings came out too chard, others not cooked enough), but everything was still very tasteful. We went for an anniversary dinner, but due to the noise level we had to sit next to each other instead of across from each other. Not a big deal, we like to be close, but I know some couples prefer their space. We also could not talk too much because we could not hear each other that well. Once the place started to clear out, the noise level was still high but dropped significantly.Down side: Even though we had a 9pm reservation, we were not seated until 10pm and we did not start eating until 10:30pm. Take this into account whether you are walking-in or have a reservation. If your expecting to be seated and start eating within a half hour (reasonable) plan ahead and eat before you go. Better yet, sit at the bar (first come first serve), you will get your food faster and probably enjoy the rowdy atmosphere more. Generally not very romantic. But great drinks and good food."
this place is def one of a kind! you won't get food like this anywhere else. make sure you make reservations cause they get crowded fast! they say they take walk-ins but i wouldn't take that chance.
Don't believe the hype! Food is fine but the service makes you feel like you're dining at Benigans. For $80/head at a shared plate restaurant you'd think they'd occasionally swap out your dirty plates. Not so much. Or the coup de grace: my wife and I went to use the bathroom at the same time and came back to our dessert in the middle of the table and our napkins gone. They're getting fat off the tourist trade and you shouldn't indulge unless you like paying for hype.
Service was disjointed in formula and execution. Â Food was meh. Â Friendly folks and good cocktails get two stars. Â The bread was amazing! Â We came for the food and left disappointed.
"Girl & the Goat is an amazing restaurant! Â Its one of the most unique restaurants in Chicago! Â Unless you get there for an early dinner around 4:30pm or make reservations one month in advance you'll have to expect to wait a long time to get seating. Â The environment was energetic and the food was a full of flavor and deliciousness! I'm not the biggest fan of shared table seating and the last time there we were sitting across from complete strangers making it awkward eating in front of them...however the food makes up the seating arrangements. Â Some of my favorites include Pork Shank, shishito peppers and grilled octopus are absolutely amazing!!! Â Also don't forget the fries!"
"**INNOVATIVE AND EXCELLENT FOOD IN CHICAGO**With all the high accolades and reviews, I was looking forward to this particular dinner. TAXI====Around $10 from downtown.AMBIANCE=========Spacious, dark, and trendy.Casual upscale.FOOD=====RAW KUSSHI ($12 for 4)Muscatel mignonette and tarragon went well. Sweet with a tang.RATING: 4/5GRILLED BABY OCTOPUS ($15)With guanciale, favas, radish pods, pistachios, and a lemon vinaigrette worked out perfectly on our taste buds.

It's loud here. Not ideal for romance (if you wish to talk to each other for example), but great for groups.Chicago is winning us over.HIGHLY RECOMMEND."
"love this place, lucked into a table. Â Good recommendations from the servers, actually afordable for a dinner out, fun vibe. Â Love."
"Booking in advance is a must. Â This place is popular.The restaurant is located on a busy Chicago street. Once inside, the vibe is industrial, hip, chic, etc. In my opinion, slightly pretentious. Â The waiters and waitresses seem slightly judgmental, and obviously there are not many families here. Â I would also recommend slightly dressing up for a meal here. The food is fun and excellent! With unique combinations and flavors that are tough to find. Â They recommend 2-3 dishes per person. As a group of 4, we ordered 8 and found that to be plenty. Â They pressure you to order all dishes at beginning of the meal, but as you go along you realize how full you're getting. Â You can always order more, don't let them pressure you into ordering more food than you need at the beginning.Enjoy the ambience, savor the flavors, and note the awesome presentation."
"I'm gonna get nasty looks for this but......I don't see the hype of this place. I guess I'll chalk it up to being too simple to appreciate it. I've brought 2 dates here and they loved it. The scene is smooth and hip so that's good. Getting a reservation short notice =D good luck with that so plan ahead. The service is amiable so hats off to that. The dessert here is good I'll give it that. I've tried most of them but here's the deal, I can't really recall any of the dishes or entrees....they just were not memorable for me. A previous GF of mine was an exceptional cook who dabbled in spices, she loves this place maybe because she can appreciate the delicacy of it . Me? this place is just way over my head. I would go back just for dessert. If you do go try to find the seating in front of the chefs, they are nice enough to provide samples and even full dishes for you and your date to try. Definitely makes it a fun experience if you can land that."
Service was extremely slow and two of the items we ordered were no longer available by the end of the dinner even though we had already ordered them. Â Expected much more from such a highly regarded restaurant.
"Just came back from girl and the goat and the service was exceptionally good. Â We had an early dinner around 5pm and the place was already half full.It didn't take us long to order four dishes. 1) the pig's face ($16): the best dish we ordered. Â The meat was so tender and the yolk on the egg gave the dish some dimension to the taste. Â 2) sugo ($16) papardelle with goat, pork, veal sauce. Â Least favourite because the pasta was on a warm to cool side. Â I was expecting the dish to be a bit warmer. Â 3) johnny Apple cheese bread with malt oil and chilli butter ($4) Very dense bread but was hoping a bit more chew to it. Â Nothing too special. Â We wanted some carb but we could have ordered something instead.4) baked quail ($16) you get about 3 quail legs. There are oyster mushrooms and some veggies I can't tell. Â Average dish but better than the papardelle5) bittersweet chocolate ($8) with shiitake chocolate and gelato. Â Very unique combination. Â I can see this dessert is not for everyone. Â There's a strong mushroom taste to it and you must like it to enjoy it. Â Personally I really love this because the shiitake chocolate is nice and crunchy and paired very well with the brownie and icecream6) miso-butterscotch budino ($8). Â Another asian inspired dessert. Â The custard was great but I'm not so sure about the cake in the middle because it's on a dryer side for my liking Overall I felt that this place offered a great food experience. Â Would come back again."
"This place was...alright. I'm thinking more along the lines of 3.5 stars. I think I was expecting more based on reviews and recommendations, but it was still a good experience. My boyfriend and I came here and we ordered the beet salad, the oysters, some fish (I think it was halibut or cod..?) and of course we had to have some goat! Honestly, I don't even remember what the goat dish was called, but it had some shrimp, lobster and some onions on top of it. It was good, but incredibly small. I think my favorite thing was actually the beet salad, surprisingly. We also ordered two Old Fashions and those were strong and tasty. Overall, the meal was good, not great, but extremely over priced. The service was good, too, and I'm glad I finally got to try the Girl and the Goat, but I don't think I'll be back anytime soon...My wallet can't handle it, especially when my tummy is left wanting more."
Local artist friend took us here and it was great! Liberal use of Kimchi eclectic yet delicious! Not always the case at other trendy tratorias.
"Girl And The Goat. Normally it takes 2-3 months to get a table reservation but a local told me to head here early at 5 pm for their bar and lounge for their walk in sitting. Did not have to wait at all since they open at 430. Their food is amazing!! I had the chickpea fritter to start, main course of Wood Oven roasted pig and for dessert the Miso Butterscotch Budino. All delicious. For beer I tried their Girl and the Goatee IV. Definitely a must place to visit in Chicago."
Love what this restaurant has done for the neighborhood over the years. So many memories. Everything about this restaurant has been said many times over. Pork Shoulder and Cauliflower will always be the favorites.
"My wife is a big foodie, and I am not. Â I prefer down home cooking, of the kind you might find at any of a hundred cornerside burger and hotdog places in Chicago. Â But, I am down with the Girl & the Goat. Â It's one of the high dining places that we can both enjoy. Â Win."
"I feel so bad for writing a 3 star review for Girl and the Goat. I came here last Thursday with the boy for our anniversary. Along with a bottle of wine, we ordered the grilled oysters, scallops, lamb tartare and pig face. We were pretty disappointed with the oysters and lamb. Ruxbin has better grilled oysters. The scallops were quite good and the pig face was alright. The wait between the oysters/lamb and scallops/pig face was pretty long. Service could have been a bit more attentive. However, they did provide a complimentary dessert for our special occasion which was nice. Maybe I've just built this place up so much in my head that I was bound to be disappointed. I just thought that with such a standout place like Girl and the Goat, anything we ordered off the menu would be fantastic?However, I am willing to try again! Preferably with more people so we can try more of the menu."
It went here for my girlfriend's birthday. Amazing spot.
The food was great and they gave us some shishito peppers and date cake on the house :)
We ordered:Jack o lantern breadkSauteed green beensRoasted beetshamachi crudoSteamed cape cod musselsPig faceRaw kushi oystersBraised beef tongueEverything was good but a little too fatty for our taste. Â Bread was great. Â Beets come in a huge portion. Â Hamachi we had to order two since it was so good. Â Pig face was a little overrated in my opinion. Â We tried it based on many recommendations on Yelp but I wouldn't order it again. Â Mussels were good. Â Tongue was also good.With every dish servers gave a short presentation of the dish explaining what it includes and how it was cooked.
"I have been looking forward to coming to Chef Stephanie Izard's restaurant for so long. I loved the vibe of this place, cool music and relaxed atmosphere. Everything we ordered was superb but I have to say the stand outs were the Pig Face ( don't get intimidated by the name because this dish is magnificent) and the scallops. The roasted beet salad was very refreshing and if you are a fan of bleu cheese then I recommend the broccoli with bleu cheese. I don't know if you actually can go wrong with any dish here but I look forward to trying them all some day. Happy eating!"
"Octopus and cauliflower and absolutely amazing! Â Had the short ribs, peppers and some oysters...highly recommend this flavor adventure!!"
"Hands down one of the best if not the best restaurant in Chicago. From the staff, decor, music and all the amazing food options. Came in on a Sunday night and sat at the bar to dine alone and the bartender was so kind he gave me all half dishes so I could even try more! Â If you have t been, GO!!!"
"Finally made it here - for my birthday - after hearing so many rave reviews from friends not in the restaurant industry, and mixed reviews from those in it. Even though I am in the industry myself and should have heeded the warnings, I was super excited. Everything was SUBPAR. Actually, service was downright terrible. After I mentioned to my server twice that I was saving room for dessert, at the end of entrees, she just dropped a check and walked away; no asking if we needed more drinks, coffee, dessert...terrible salesmanship. I guess that was okay, though, because halfway through the meal, I got really dizzy and super nauseated. Like, I was getting really drunk, really fast even though I was barely through my first cocktail. Not exaggerating: the only other time I had ever felt that way was when I was roofied in college (and luckily was saved before anything bad happened). Not saying that I was roofied, but something was super funky! The food was good, but not to die for, the way people rave about it. Nothing stood out as special.The second I walked into my house, I started vomiting like crazy and puked like I have never puked before for the next 8 hours. Food didn't get any better the second time around. So, happy birthday to me, I guess..."
"Absolutely worth all the 5-star reviews. Excellent food, service, and price. The summer tom bread, chickpea fritter, pork shank, and peaches 'n cream dessert were flavorful and perfectly sized. Will bring any friends visiting Chicago here again!"
"All in all a very good dining experience.While there was a bit of a wait for our table - the restaurant was packed - our reservation was handled cheerfully and professionally.We started with the kohlrabi salad, which was a nice, crunchy, mixture of sweet and savory.This was followed by the hamachi crudo - my wife's favorite dish of the evening - where the freshness of the fish was accented nicely by the richness of the crispy pork belly and the aioli.Next on the menu for us was braised goat neck. Â I loved this dish - because I really like goat - but it was a bit one-note and there was a LOT of meat. The pig face was a bit of a surprise - more of a hash and a bit smaller and less crispy than I expected. Â Still, it was a good dish and mixing the egg yolk into the dish made for smooth yummy porky bites of food.The only things that make me rate Girl & the Goat four stars rather than five are 1) the restaurant wasn't quite as good as I expected and 2) the wine list, especially by the glass, was pretty mediocre. Â I would have expected a much more extensive and interesting wine list to pair with the unusual and rich food.Service was friendly and prompt, and it was a fun evening."
"I heard there's a 2-3 month wait to get a reservation here, but I was looking for a place to eat on Open Table and I got a reservation for four that night. So keep checking online this place is worth it. Here's a list of what we got: -Hamachi crudo (crisp pork belly, chili aioli, caperberries) - This came with four tiny tiny pieces of pork belly..and I mean the size of a small paperclip. It was delicious but I wish the pieces were a lot bigger. -Diver scallops- delicious, but it wasn't something so unbelievable or unique that you can only get here. -Duck tongues - this sounds unappetizing, but you have got to try this. It freaked me out that they were shaped like tongues, but you'll get over it because it tastes amazing!-Wood oven roasted pig face - also delicious! We got two for four people which was more than enough because it got a tiny bit too salty towards the end. -Roasted cauliflower - good! This helped balance everything out.For dessert: ""coffeecake"" semifreddobittersweet chocolatesticky date cakemiso-butterscotch budinoJust get them all! They were all delicious, I especially liked the coffeecake."
"Not that Girl and the Goat needs my review, but I thought it was a great dining experience. The food was very good, especially the crumpets and the hamachi, but everything was above board. I also found the decor extremely charming. If I could move one of those giant wooden tables and chairs into my own house ...The service was also impeccable. Waiting months for a rez may be a bit excessive (especially since I think hype can kill your experience), but I hear you can get tables on shorter notice if you're willing to eat early or late (read: 10 PM)."
no reservation but got there at 4:45pm on a thursday for dinner and was seated outside. it was packed inside already!shared a bunch of plates-escargot ravioli-pig face with egg on top-stuffed zucchini blossoms-goat empanada with blueberries-forgot the name of the dessert but it blew my mind. lots of different textures and complimenting flavors. flan/cream/candied almonds/cake. yum yum yummm
there's a long wait here for a reason.I had my birthday dinner here. I booked my reservation 3 months in advance for a party of 4 at 8 pm on a friday night. Got seated right away when we got there. Here's what we liked and what we didn't. Liked: The ambient. classy yet casual. good lighting makes people look better. We all really liked the pig tongue and the cauliflower. The bill was surprisingly more reasonable than expected: $55 each with drinks + tips and we left full. Didn't like/could be better: Our waiter was competent but still not great. We got our bread randomly towards the end of the meal. The desserts were just average. The famed pig-face was a tad too sweet; we actually thought it was one of the not-as-good dishes of the night. This was not the best meal I've had in Chicago for a similar price range (Dusek currently takes the crown). It's up there to deserve 5 stars on yelp though. They make vegetables taste soo good.
"Came here for dinner with some friends. Ended up getting a table at the bar at around 9:00 pm on a Sunday.Ordered cauliflower, shishito peppers, duck tongue, pig face, pork shank, grilled octopus, and frog legs. Their signature pig face dish was all our favorite!! Loved the shishito peppers, which are baked in a ceramic bowl with Parmesan cheese encrusted on top. Duck tongue had a nice texture with a citrus flavorful taste. Pork shank was crispy yet tender and came right off the bone. Frog legs were very small and tasted similar to chicken. most of the dishes had little bacon bits and were a tad bit on the salty side, but each dish had a different and unique flavor. Did not order dessert, but I will come back again =]"
"Look at the reviews! Would you look at the reviews?!This is one of those places I wish I'd known nothing about so I could keep my expectations in check. But since they require reservations TWO MONTHS in advance, I had no choice.The place serves their meals tapas style. With a small menu split into three parts (V: veggie, F: fish, and M: meats), you choose 1-3 plates per person.The three of us opted for:+Roasted cauliflower: served with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. Delicious! (Great shot, Rho T. yelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦)+Kusshi oysters: a bit too fishy for my taste, but I usually like kusshi oysters.+Steamed west coast mussels: served with perilla, winter squash, with a garlic crunch on top and some grilled bread. Tasty!+Wood oven roasted pig face: rich, porky goodness, served with a sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro with red wine-maple aioli. Surprisingly food... for a pig's face. Great shot from Jennifer N. yelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦+Bread with mushroom butter and tomato oil. Well documented, Victoria W. yelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦. The tomato oil was divine!+Dessert: PB+J with peanut butter ice cream with conchord grape granita and brioche donuts. Kare C. knows what's up: yelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦+Drinks: Blood & Goats (Monkey Shoulder Scotch, Leopold tart cherry, Savannah Madeira, and orange) and the Lake Effect (Journeyman rye, F.E.W. gin, Koval chrysanthemum honey liqueur, and lemon--thanks, Samantha E. yelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦) were my favorites."
"Happening place with cool bar and excellent small plates. Tough to get a table even during the week, but there is the chance you can grab a seat at the bar IF you get there early. We had two specialty cocktails that we liked, and there's a good selection of beer. But they only had a handful of wines by the glass, which is a crying shame.However, the food is a delight, with layers and layers of big, robust, irresistible flavors. The roast broccoli was great, on a creamy bed of (mild blue?) cheese that made it rich and satisfying. The grilled octopus brought many other textures and taste to bear. The skirt steak was tasty, but had WAY too much salt on it--still, hard to resist. Our favorite of the night: the roast chicken. Boring choice, you say? Oh no--not when it's on a bed of potatoes draped in a wonderful pan sauce. The depth of smoky flavor had me convinced they'd infused it with bacon fat (they didn't). I can honestly say this is the BEST roast chicken I've ever had in my spend-too-much-on-food life.Sadly, there isn't one in L.A., because some of the items blew the doors off of similar dishes we've had in good restaurants back home. Kudos to the Girl, the Goat, and to Chicago."
The Â & the Â offers an amazing mix of Â adventurous small plates! Business dinner with foodies... So we sampled MOST of the menu! Izard's creativeness with flavors makes for a unique palate experience! Great personalized service too!
"Everything you could want in a restaurant: great food, great service, inventive menu, and a vibrant atmosphere without being so loud you need to shout to be heard. Â Also, props to whoever crafted such an eclectic wine list. Â A can't miss place in Chicago."
"Very unique dishes, and a really fun place to try. I think it was really tough to live up to all the hype, and in my opinion, it just falls short. But don't let that discourage you from going here! If you order the right things, you'll probably have one of the better meals you've ever had.Came here at 5, got a seat at the bar right away. If you want an actual table...good luck, unless you had a reservation 3 months ago. The bar is just as good a place to sit if you have a small party (2-3).Heather P.'s review on here probably nailed the food ratings...except for the green beans. I would rate those much higher. I think the key here is to be adventurous. The vegetable dishes are usually large and seasoned VERY well, i would get at least one. I really want to go back and try the duck tongue because that sounds really good. Pig face is usually a good bet too. I would skip the escargot ravioli."
So crowed there. We waited for a long time and got seats near the bar. Food were so tasty. We enjoyed everything!!
Great food and professional service! Need a reso months in advance or chance it at the bar or lounge area. Top 5 spots in chi-city!
"My roommate and I were lucky enough to land a reservation at the Goat last Friday night- what a fantastic night. We walked in and were immediately greeted by the hostess who welcomed us with a smile. She was quick to find our name, and told us we would be seated shortly. We decided to grab a drink at the bar.... Which let me note, this place was packed to capacity; it was 9pm. Unlike other over crowded bars, G&G gave off an electricity that I felt privileged to be a part of. The Bartenders moved behind the bar as if they were dancing- I was amazed how they weaved in and out of the wells while greeting guests, shaking martinis, and tapping beers. I enjoyed a spicy tequila drink that was new to the menu... perfect. We were seated shortly after we checked-in, and greeted by Danielle. The service was impeccable. She took us through the menu, noted a few of the house favorites, and answered all of our questions with ease. Shortly after we ordered, Ryan, G&G's Sommelier introduced himself. His knowledge on wine was impressive... He obviously is passionate about wine and takes his role very seriously. I won't get into the details, but the food and was fantastic... the Broccoli... try it! Can't wait to go back for more!"
"Great food, but don't over order. One to one and half plates is great per person unless you're starving. Bring friends so you can share lots of different items."
"I dined here in late summer, but I have been meaning to post this review here ever since. Â My Girl & The Goat reservation that I scheduled two months before the date was at 4:30 p.m. We arrived promptly and didn't leave until 7:45 p.m. That is three hours and fifteen minutes of sheer gluttony. Our server, Hunter, didn't mind at all. Â In fact he encouraged it. The dining experience is mainly tapas (small plates), meant to be shared and enjoyed over time. It is best to start with the lighter fare, and to work your way up to the heartier, meatier dishes. We did just that. Our starters were the pan fried Shishito peppers, served with parmesan, sesame and miso and the ""Corny Goat,"" which is French bread served with goat cheese butter and corn relish. Next was the grilled baby octopus, which included guanciale, favas, radish pods, pistachios, and lemon vinaigrette and cofit goat belly, served with bourbon butter, lobster 'n crab, and fennel. So far, so good. We were off to a fine start, and I was already starting to feel satisfied, yet edging towards full. Now comes the heavy lifting. We opted for the wood oven roasted pig face, served with a sunny-side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple, and potato sticks. It was tender and flavorful. We also opted for the Pinn Oaks lamb tartare, prepared with sweet corn tapenade, tuna aioli, and water crackers. Although I was on the brink of exploding, I was extremely satisfied and felt very content. I sat back in my chair, closed my eyes, and savored every last bite. To finish our meal, we decided upon the miso-butterscotch budino: bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashews, as well as the milk chocolate and galangal napoleon, served with blackberries and passion fruit.Throughout our meal, we tried a variety of different drinks: ""Blood and Goats,"" a concoction of Monkey Shoulder Scotch, Leopold Tart Cherry, Savannah Madeira, and orange; ""The Lake Effect:"" Journeyman Rye, FEW Gin, Chrysanthemum Honey Liqueur, and lemon; and ""The Foghorn:"" also FEW Gin, Cocchi Vermouth, Luxardo cherries, and orange bitters. My two-month wait time for a reservation was well worth it. Â There are so many more places to explore and eat in Chicago that I believe I would be perfectly content finding a new spot, every night for one year. Windy City, I don't know how you manage to do it every single time, but you really do blow me away."
"After a few failed attempts of coming here (just not calling early enough for a review) my boyfriend surprised me with a Girl & The Goat dinner reservation for my birthday! Â We had reservations at 6:45 on a Thursday, and arrived right at 6:45 and were seated right away. Â We were very close to the people on either side of us, which wasn't really an issue...but could have been annoying if you didn't want to sit so close to someone! Â The bench was really low, which made me feel so tall sitting in a ""regular"" sized chair. Â All that aside, the ambiance was really fun. Â The waiter took a long time to get started with taking our drink order and telling us about the menu, so we were a little confused about that, but once the meal got started he was great. Â He timed the food and even drinks perfectly! Â We started off with some bread with baked sun dried tomatoes on the inside and a tomato oil and green onion cream cheese, so good! Â I guess it's the trendy thing to do now to charge people for bread, which I think is silly when you're paying so much for the food...but what can ya do (Save for not ordering bread, which would be even sillier!)?! Â We got a goat carpaccio off the daily specials. Â All the ingredients and sauces (which I can't remember) were exquisite together! Next came the sauteed green beans. Â There was a heaping portion, which we didn't even finish. Â The sauce was amazing! Â My boyfriend really liked them, but thought the beans were too crispy, but I thought they were perfect! Â  We then got the squash blossom rangoon - basically crab rangoon with a twist, hard to mess up - so it was also quite tasty. Â Last item we got was the wood oven roasted pig face. Â I was a little hesitant at first but since my boyfriend's friend and the waiter recommended it, decided let's do it! Â It was tasty, had a bit of a gamey taste to it (to me), but it was good. Â The waiter came in and showed us how to eat it by mixing it all up for us...glad he did that to get all the flavors and sauces in each bite. Â I had two glasses of pino nior which were good and a dessert drink, which I can't remember what it was called - but it was really good! Â My boyfriend had a few old fashioneds which he said were good. Â Overall a great experience and great ambiance. Â I will absolutely come back again sometime!"
"I've been interested in checking this place out for quite some time and finally was able to make it in on a recent Thursday evening. Â There were four of us, we had a reservation and our table was ready when we got there. Â The space is a lot more casual than I was expecting and it's pretty loud. Â Some of the tables are communal and all of the tables long so you end up slightly further away from your companion than you normally would be.One host was extremely friendly while one of the hostesses had a dead look on her face both times I walked up to the stand. Â All staff was extremely friendly and attentive.We got a pretty good variety of items off the menu. Â Some were great, others were good and a couple of things were just average. Â The octopus we got was way, way too salty. Â The oysters that were on special weren't great either. Â The Korean inspired beef ribs were definitely a pass. Â They were expensive and not great both flavorwise and quality. Â Some of the highlights were the escargot ravioli, an onion potsticker , roasted cauliflower and corn fed bread. Â I liked the braised beef tongue but no one else did. Â It was very much in the vein of a Mexican style preparation and I really liked that. Â I think the menu changes seasonally so this stuff may or may not be on there.The dessert I got was good too. All and all it was nice, slightly more of a scene type environment than I would usually prefer for dinner and probably not some place I am eager to return to any time soon."
"Excellent service & always a fun & lively atmosphere. I normally don't love small plates (mostly bc I've done it SO much), but this menu serves well as small portions. It's a great way to try dishes you'd never order as an entire meal."
"So my colleague and I came here because everyone in this city told us toChick pea 3/5 at first I didn't like it, for some reason it tasted a lot better when it was colderPeppers 4/5 my colleague didn't like it, he said it was bitter. I loved It Halibet 4/5 it was soft and full of flavor Scallops 4.5/5 the second best dish of the night. Â Probably the best scallops I've had but there were only twoGoat empanadas 3.5/5 the were nice and they could of used a little more spice Pig face .5/5 I'm polish and I eat a lot of pork and my colleague didn't have any because he's Muslim but that was just burnt pork with egg. I was told to smash it all together and for this being the famous dish I was extremely disappointedGoat ribs 5/5 best meal of the night. Wow the goat fell right of the ribs and it was full of flavor. My colleague is from Jamaica and eats a lot of goat and considers this the best goat ribs everVibe of the place and staff are great and 5/5 I will def be coming here again, just not anything pork related. Just goatI want to give at least a four maybe a five but that pork faced wasn't good. Â :("
"This place is so good. My friend and I came here during our trip to Chicago. We didn't make a reservation (as it was nearly impossible to make a reservation unless it was made months in advance). Instead, we waited for seats at the bar (which is first-come, first served), and we were waiting like hawks. About 20 min. later, we got seats. Overall, the food and ambiance is amazing. I would definitely want to come back for the other dishes that I didn't get to try."
Foods are delicious!
"I've been hesitating on writing a review for this restaurant because I had so much to say! Overall, the restaurant was phenomenal and exceeded any expectations I had. All the dishes were crafted with such casual mastery--the simplest menu items when combined became exquisite and well-balanced dishes. I was amazed at the thoughtfulness of each dish. Â Dish descriptions: Roasted Beets with green beans, white anchovy, crÃ¨me fraiche, and bread crumbs. This dish was light and refreshing. I love beets so I was happy, but the bread crumbs added a slightly weird texture.Chickpea Fritter. I am not really sure what was in this dish but it had an Indian food taste to it. Our two Indian food companions were impressed and overjoyed. Mmm... so savory.Trout Tartare with marinated clams and remoulade. This dish went quick. I have never had trout tartare so this was quite a treat--fresh, vibrant, with a hint of tartness.Grilled Baby Octopus with guanciale (Italian cured meat--Googled that one), pistachio, beans, and lemon vinaigrette. When our dinner companion, who has a quieter demeanor usually, took a bite, he slammed both of his fists to the table, and screamed ""This is so good!"" For me, this dish represented the genius of the menu. This hodgepodge of ingredients came together and did a lively square dance in my mouth. I can't even begin to describe the magnificence of this dish--every bite was a little different and never ceased to impress me.Confit Goat Belly with lobster and crab, goat butter, and fennel. We wanted to be a bit adventurous and also to partake in the namesake of the restaurant so we tried the goat belly dish. This was a nice rich dish with the butter and belly, but was not too memorable for me.Wood-Fired Walter's Chicken. I have no idea what was in this dish, but it was spectacular. I usually don't like to order chicken at restaurants but this dish was out of this world. The chicken was tender, moist, and rich with comforting flavors. Pig Face. Mmm... with a name like that, how could you not order it? This was a fun and playful dish that brought tons of meaty goodness and gooey egginess. From now on, I feel like no visit to Chicago is complete without The Girl and the Goat."
"I've gotten a lot of flak over the last few years for remaining steadfastly ehhh on Girl and the Goat. Â So I went back again, armed with a gift certificate and a more optimistic attitude. Â We got to the restaurant around 5:20 and was quoted 45 minutes for indoor seating, which gave us time to sit at the waiting area and order some cocktails and a Johnny Applecheese bread. Â (Incidentally, I saw a lot of people just having their dinner in the waiting area, which made me wonder if a table was necessary.) Â The wait actually was 10 minutes more than expected, but we were filled up a little on food so it wasn't bad.Dish reviews:APPLECHEESE BREAD - This was delicious; warm with the perfect amount of flavor, and the malted oil and the chili cheese butter were perfect complements. Â Highly recommended.CAULIFLOWER - Great; roasted to a delicate crisp and supplemented by the crunch of pine nuts. Â The pickled peppers (I felt like I was in a tongue twister) was my favorite part. Â Large helping of veggies, way enough for two people.BROCCOLI - The server recommended this but both my boyfriend and I found it a little less amazing than the cauliflower. Â The blue cheese was a little overwhelming and I was put off by the very strong smokey smell. Â It really did ""taste like a campfire.""ESCARGOT RAVIOLI - They were fine, but not outstanding. Â The escargot flavor was too delicate for my taste, and the tamarind-miso sauce could be a little thicker.MT LASEN TROUT - We really, really loved this dish, even though I'm usually skeptical of fish not cooked the Chinese way. Â The pumpkin base really pulled the whole dish together, and the pomegranates softened the slightly bitter crunch of the brussel sprouts.PIG FACE - I mean, come on. Â The boyfriend was the skeptical one this time, but even he loved it. Â Must have.Summary: Â Unlike the last time I went, I felt like the food was not overly salty this time around, but it was still not enough of a value or a stellar enough experience to warrant five stars. Â Would I come here again? Â Yes. Â But with all the great new restaurants in Chicago I have yet to try, it may be a while before I'm back."
"Believe the hype; this was probably one of the best meals I've ever had (and was only under $50 pp! What?!). The location is a bit random and awkward to get to (why doesn't that bridge have better pedestrian crossings?), but the restaurant itself is huge and industrial-feeling (including a small sidewalk patio), yet with a homey comfortable vibe that seemed to suit everything from a fancy date to a casual bite with friends (I even saw some kids there, so I guess it's good for families as well?). Our waiter was attentive and welcoming, and helped us navigate the menu. The drink menu has some cool cocktails and some nice local beers, so we tried a few to start and were pretty happy with our selections (try the Cross of Gold beer). The food menu is comprised of small plates divided into a few different categories (bread, meat, seafood, veg, goat, dessert). Between three of us, the waiter recommended we order six dishes, so we started off sharing the Summertom homemade bread and then each picked one dish for the table and one dish to primarily keep for ourselves, including: kohlrabi salad, spring onion potstickers, squash blossom crab rangoons, halibut, goat empanadas, pig face, and then for dessert, the Thai basil chocolate brownie dessert to split between all 3.I doubt you can go wrong here, because I didn't eat a single bite all night that I didn't think was absolutely delicious/fairly unique/well-executed, but the standout for me was the halibut (which happen to be my 'personal' dish)... the fish was cooked to perfection, and the sauce and accompaniments were so out of this world that I physically had to stop myself from licking the dish after the food was gone (I have no idea what was in that sauce, but it was very umami and very addicting). I was so distracted by how amazing the food was that I didn't even think to take any pics or record the menu, and barely remembered to take a pic of the receipt so I could remember exactly what we ordered (and how damn cheap it was compared to some other lessor restaurants I've been to). I don't think the three of us even really spoke much, we were so focused on how good everything was and I think the extent of our conversation was like, ""OMG try this!"" and ""holy wow, that's fricken good"". So, yeah, Stephanie Izard definitely won Top Chef for a reason. I was rooting for her during her season, and now I'm an even bigger fan. If you're a also fan of hers, or Top Chef, or awesome food, or even just cool restaurants in general, you need to come here ASAP.Pro-tip: arrive just prior to 4:30 when it opens (early bird special, what what) and you're likely to be able to secure a table without waiting months for a reservation."
"Love this place. Been here twice and have enjoyed every drink and every dish I've ordered. Service has always been great too. (Also dined 3 tables away from Jane Lynch when I was there 2 weeks ago... it was hard not to keep looking!)You absolutely do need a reservation. When I know I have friends or family coming to town, I make reservations as soon as they book their flights (months in advance). Walk-in wait times can be 2+ hours, if available at all. The other good thing about this place is that it is a great value. Other top-notch restaurants in Chicago will easily be 3 figures per person after drinks and food, but Girl & the Goat is much more approachable for the average foodie."
"We only come for special occasions because getting reservations is a bit like winning the lottery. But if you get in, the payoff is worth it. Had the best birthday here ever. I blabbed that it was my B-day thinking Id get a piece of free cake or something, but what I got was so much better. They sat us right in front of the kitchen so we got to watch and interact with the amazing cooks there. They put on such an awesome show of skill, it was a joy to watch. On top of that they were super friendly, and you can tell they were proud of their work.Have you tried the food? Holy cow, it's so good. Try the duck tongues, pig face, broccoli, shishito peppers, goat carpaccio. The list of outstanding menu items is about as long as their whole menu, so you cannot go wrong. I'm stunned that it's not more expensive. Of course it winds up costing a lot when you attempt to eat your own weight in food (we have to since we don't know when we'll get back in!)Overall, just an awesome time. The waiters, hostesses, even the water guy are all super cool and friendly. Can't wait to come back and eat more!"
"I called a month in advance to make reservations and they were booked for 2 months! That should tell you everything you need to know.We decided to try our luck and walk in- there was an hour and a half wait at the bar but the hostess told us two people had conveniently not shown up so we were seated immediately! I honestly couldn't tell you what we ordered. We asked the waiter to bring out his favorite items and he delivered with 5 amazing dishes- all for a reasonable price of about $150 minus the tip. I do remember the ravishing escargot ravioli and the rich pig face topped with an egg (amazing).I recommend this restaurant to adventurous people who enjoy trying different things. If this review applies to you- then ""The Girl & The Goat"" will not disappoint!"
"Food is good but expensive and small. Not good for a family for sure , parking is a problem"
"This place is incredible. The service is amazing, truly spectacular. Our server told us ""you can't go wrong with this menu"" and damn she was right. The highlight of our meal was the escargot ravioli and duck breast. Incredible food, even more incredible service."
"Finally made it to Girl & the Goat. Had to make late, weeknight reservations weeks in advance - it was either that or do a weekend months from now. We ordered 6 small plates for 2 hungry people who wanted to try a lot. The pan-roasted halibut was definitely the best thing we ate - moist fish and gorgeous marcona almond sauce. The crispy fried duck tongues were a close second, and the hamachi crudo and beet salad were also nice. We tried the goat carpaccio from the goat section, and it was a tiiiiny portion, but good and not too gamey. The service was friendly enough and quick, and of course the dishes were inventive, but with all the rave reviews, I guess I just expected more, to be honest. It was SO LOUD, so dark, and the tables are right on top of each other. Maybe this is just a case of a place being way over-hyped - nothing we had was BAD, but the ambiance was lacking and it just seemed too in love with its own hip reputation."
"Really loved the atmosphere of this place, loved the cocktails and the service can't wait to go back to try the food. It's a perfect date night place and def get reservations, we were lucky enough to find a seat at the bar but there was a bunch of people waiting to get even bar seating!"
"The atmosphere was really nice. The best food items were the cauliflower, goat empanadas, sliced steak something was VERY good and a must try! All the other reviews say to try the chickpea fritters and I did l...but they were very heavy and tasted cheese filled. Don't be deceived by the portion sizes as they are small but very rich/flavorful aka heavy so it will definitely leave you full.The chef is amazing, very much so a different place that we haven't ever tried before. If you can't get a reservation you can eat on the lounge couches and it actually is more fun there.The menu has a lot of pork items and if you are allergic to nuts you have to be very careful it definitely narrows your choices down. If you are visiting Chicago it is a really cool place to try!"
"We had been wanting to try this place from all the hype we had been hearing from friends who had gone and finally got a reservation (3 weeks later) for a 530 dinner on a Thursday night. The atmosphere is very laid back and good oldies hip hop playing in the background. It's tapas style and we got the cheese and bread (best thing I had). We also got squash Rangoon, escargot ravioli, ham frites, roasted pig face, and the ribs. Â The Rangoon was tasty and had a very good sauce with it. Â The escargot had a lot of flavor and was very enjoyable. Â Ham frites were delicious. They are just regular fries with dry ham sprinkle on top. Â The pig face seems like a step and run dish but is actually a very delicious course served with egg and other things that was great. Â The ribs were plain nothing great. Â We got a dessert but don't remember what it was but it was delicious. I'm sure they all are!!!"
"Had a great dinner here as expected. Every dish we tried was excellent. Pig face seems to be everyone's favorite. It wasn't my #1 of the stuff we had, but it was very good. I liked the goat empanadas and goat shank the best. Also we all really liked the chickpea fritters. We got green been and cauliflower vegetable dishes which were also very good, for green stuff. The only one I didn't much like was the pork shank, I thought the buttermilk ranch and the other spicier sauce were a weird combination and didn't go well together or with the dish. I can't comment on dessert because we skipped out and headed back for Jeni's Ice Cream.. again. The place is hyper popular, so if you want a reservation you'll probably have to make it months in advance (or at least weeks in advance if you're ok with 4:30 on a weekday). We just walked up around 4:30 however and were one of the first to put our name in, and ended up getting seated after 15 minutes. Walking up during peak hours would be a different story though."
"I am so happy we were able to get a reservation at the Girl & the Goat! Â Apparently the owner was a winner of American's Top Chef three years ago making it a challenge to secure a seat, but WOW. Â Considering the quality vs. price, you just can't beat it! Â  Here was the experience:- Â service: Â one of the best I have EVER experienced at any restaurant I have been to- Â location: Â  Awesome!- Â food: Â scallops - 5 stars (they only gave two but were amazing), goat empanadas - 4 stars ( only two as well...I am not sure I really like goat, but the flavors were nice), crispy lamb shank with naan - 5 stars (the lamb was RIDICULOUSLY amazing..served with two sauces that weren't even necessary because the meat was sheer perfection!), desert chocolate brownie with gelato and basil...ehhhhh most of it was good, I am not sure we liked the basil, but it was a light desert for chocolate! Â We also ordered homemade bread with special spreads that we really enjoyed.- Â total bill: Â food, 4 glasses of wine $148 which we felt was reasonable!Thank you so much for a wonderful experience - we were so delighted to go to this restaurant!"
"G&G lived up to the hype! Â The loads and loads of good hype. Â Rustic chic decor, amazing service, beautifully luscious flavorful food - and the buzz of a really great spot that people are excited to be dining in. Â This was a delightful dining experience all around. My man and I dined here on a Monday night, and it was swarming with a full waiting area. Â A Monday night in frigid February, mind you. Â That in itself is very telling - that, and the thousands of excellent reviews... Just go. Â Make a reservation for whenever you can get in, soak it up, and eat your face off.We thoroughly enjoyed everything we tried: Chicken little bread (fresh baked bread with chicken liver mousse + carrot oil)Escargot ravioliGoat belly confitScallopsCauliflowerSticky date cake"
Service was fantastic. Food was amazing. Just a wonderful experience overall. Worth the hype. Can't wait to go back!
Loved the decor and the food. The service was exceptional and everything made was delectable.
"This place is amazing. If you don't get reservations in advanced, though, they do allow walk-ins and that's how we got in on a busy Friday night. We had to wait a little but they have a nice seating and standing area as well as a bar, so we grabbed some drinks. They were a little pricy but they had a decent selection. The atmosphere is great and so is the food. Come hungry, though, because you will be trying a lot of new things. When you order you choose a few different plates and they are brought out in waves (think tapas if you've had them). I actually didn't try any goat, but I will next time! I can't speak highly enough about the pork shank, though. Â It's the best pork I've ever had and my mouth is watering just thinking about it! Another one of my favorite dishes was the oysters. Also, try the pig face as everyone says, even just to say that you have."
"Below is a copy of the review I posted om Google+Well we haven't had a chance to taste the food, so below review is strictly the ""walk-in, wait, walk-out"" experience.We arrived at 8:30 on Friday with no reservation and were told it will be 1.5hr wait. No problem! Place seemed popular and wait time reasonable.We set down at the lounge and had a few drinks. Several couples that arrived after us sat next to us and slowly one by one were seated. Okey. No problem... Finally after 2+ hours of waiting and a few reminders from us that we are still here we were seated.Great.... but not THAT great. We were seated right on the merge of two couches that moved every time you move your butt. Seating there comfortably was not possible. There were a number of open tables around us and we wanted to move to one right next to us. Same table, open, comfy seat, well we told we couldn't do that... Why we no longer cared. We walked out of the place and had a LOT of fun in the restaurant right next to it.If you are looking for great customer service Girl and a Goat is a place to avoid!"
"The dinner experience here was awesome. Â The food was so great. Â Cool design and ambience with a see-through kitchen. Â The scallops and pork belly were definitely my favorite. Â If you have the chance, don't pass up an opportunity to visit, even if you're squeezing in drinks and appetizers at the bar."
"I'm with the majority. Â This place rocks! Â You will dream about the pork shank... and you will probably smell it coming from your pores for a couple days after you eat it... EAT IT ANYWAY. Â The pig face is SO good... I don't understand HOW you can't like this... Â  Other things I love there: Â Shishito Peppers, cauliflower, empanadas... Okay, lets be serious... Everything is awesome. Â Just order one of everything off of the menu. Â You won't regret it. Â As everyone else has said and the rest of the world knows, it's near impossible to get a good reservation/time - but worth waiting for the table if you feel like having some cocktails at the bar while drooling over the food passing by.."
"Heard many great things about Girl and the Goat....who hasn't? This restaurant has been on my list ever since it opened up. Friends keep talking about how wonderful it is and how I have to try it out. I can say that I finally did and my friends weren't lying. Because it takes months to get reservations and my out-of-town friend wanted to eat there during her visit, we just popped in on a Sunday night and were told that the wait would be an hour and a half. We would've waited that long, but we were also offered to sit in the front area with the low couches and coffee table. We opted for that instead because we were hungry! My friend and I ordered about 5 small plates and the waitress shot us a look that blatantly asked ""Are you girls sure about that?!"" We were very sure and couldn't wait to eat. Each dish came after one another, there was not a single dish that we were not satisfied with. We had the grilled baby octopus, pork shank, the oven roasted pig face, and 2 others that I forgot. Nonetheless, everything was delicious! The pig face was amazing...all the different textures and flavors meshed wonderfully together. I would definitely love to come back again, but would like to actually sit down at a table. Need to make those reservations now!"
Went to check out if Girl and the Goat would live up to the hype. It met and exceeded my expectations. We were a big group and ordered each entree so we could sample pretty much everything and all of it was amazing.
"For the price - I expected more! A lot more. Not so much in food quantity, but perhaps a lower cost for the same amount of food.I also expected acoustical tiles to soften the noise. It was too loud!Okay! I guess were supposed to be there for the food - who needs to talk with your guest? I do! I like talking with friends and family.The food was tasty, but again nothing to write home about. Since, I'm not a beef or goat or pork eater, (I do eat seafood), I expected phenomenal veggies Â and really, on a good night I've cooked just as well. My rule of thumb when dining out - don't eat what you can cook at home.The waiter, was pleasant, but didn't so much attend to me - I think he had me pegged for just a guest of the other folks - when actually, he should be pleasant and kind to everyone, not those who are having glasses of wine.The chefs were interesting to watch - it had to be hot in their kitchen - which was open, so in that regard it was entertaining, but again not worth the price of groceries for a month and half. Perhaps the problem is me. I need to pick places to dine, rather than my adult children who are trendy - I'm just not with it.Another place not to bring mom and dad or the crew that's over 50."
"I'll keep this quick. Â I am not a real foodie but I love to eat good food.The food here was amazing, and for the price it's a MUST TRY. Â Chill atmosphere and the plates are small and meant to be shared. Â Came with 8 people and got around 14 dishes.For sure get the:-Pig Face-Pork Shank-Scallops"
"Have been here twice. Â Truly a gem. Â Roasted cauliflower is out of this world, and I generally shy away from cauliflower. Â This place is very sought after, so a table is extremely hard to get by. Â Requires a lot of planning or an extremely late dinner."
"What can I say that hasn't already been said? I've heard a lot about this place and was excited to try. The pig face was amazing, best thing we tried. Everything else was good and had pretty great sauces/flavor. So going back to my original question, what can I say that hasn't already been said. That would revolve around the service. One way to judge true quality is not based on how a place does when everything goes right, but how a place does when everything goes wrong. Halfway through our dinner a girl was walking by our table and started to fall over, I hopped up grabbed her and set her down as she started having a seizure. I called the ambulance and helped until they came. After everything calmed down, the manager came over, introduced himself, called me a hero :), and comped half of our entire tables bill. I was taking a couple friends to dinner, so this was awesome and much appreciated. The restaurant handled everything in a very professional manner and kept everything running smoothly. Well done."
"Girl & the Goat was slightly disappointing. I didn't think it set itself apart from all of the many other Contemporary American restaurants that exist in Chicago. There was no dish that really stood out, and yes, I did try all of the dishes that were recommended on yelp, by friends, etc. I'd rather go elsewhere since Chicago has so many options for this kind of food."
"I came here by myself for an early bird dinner on a Thursday night last month. The place is a cool hipster, divey type place with lots of wood as their interior. It is a loud place, so don't expect to hear people using indoor voices. My server was young, energetic and always pleasant. He and the rest of the staff were quick to refill my water and to check in to see how I was doing throughout my meal.I ordered 2 tapas dishes: the goat empanadas (uh-mazingly done, especially given that I don't really like feta cheese or Tzatzki sauce); and the roasted pig face (loved the sunny side egg up, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple and potato stix accompaniment- all the flavors worked perfectly and provided a blend of sheer deliciousness). For dessert, I ordered the miso-butterscotch budino, which is a mix of bacon toffee, glazed pineapple and candied cashews. It was so worth all the calories; I wanted to lick every last bit. My meal costed $44.20 including tax ($16 for each entree + $8 for dessert). Sure, the portions are tapas portions, but my meal was worth every penny. I started developing withdrawal immediately after I left the restaurant. I can't wait to come here again and/or to try their sister restaurant Little Goat. Stephanie Izard, the executive chef, won Top Chef for a reason. Definitely make reservations and try this place out even if you are in town for a day. You won't be sorry that you did."
"This place is up there alongside Jean Georges and Daniel as one of the best meals I've ever had. My friend scored a 10pm reservation about 5 months ago. We came in for the weekend from NYC and between 7 of us ordered 15 dishes one better than the next. The string beans were perfection, we tried duck tongue, which was a standout and the pig face was the best thing ever. The goat empanadas were also tasty as was the hamachi. I need to save room on here for dessert - the butterscotch budino with pineapple was heaven in a bowl. I need to go back and congratulate Top Chef alum Stephanie Izard on graduating to next level cuisine unlike anything else out there."
"Sit back and let me tell you about one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. We waited a while to get in, and our reservation was not until 10:15 pm but we were still excited to try it out. Since we are impatiently ladies we went in around 9 pm and scored a spot at the bar. We both had the best of three cocktail (which is awesome, awesome and strong).We were ravenous at the bar so we ordered a few snacks before we got our table. I have never had goat before so I saw it fitting to try. We split the goat empanadas and the chickpea fritters, both were the bomb!After being seated and reading the menu for an hour we were beyond excited to eat. There were two of us, and each dish was the perfect amount to split with one other portions. (The veggies could probably serve 3-4!) we had the cauliflower and the broccoli, and oh boy if someone doesn't likeVeggies this will for sure make them change their ways! We also had the diver scallops and the coveted pig face! Everything we tried was memorable!! Don't overlook the veggies and do not skip the goat empanadas!Take it after us, if you don't score your ideal reservation like we did (10:15) head there early and grab some seats at the bar to pass the time."
"My fiancÃ© and I went to Chicago for my birthday and had a list of restaurants we planned to visit. So glad Girl & the Goat made the cut. We did not have reservations but arrived half an hour before opening; once they were open we decided to sit at the bar. It was a great experience. The drinks were delicious and the food was extremely savory. Everything we ordered was tasty, some dishes however (like the shishito peppers) I could do without. Check this place out when you get a chance!"
"This was the first restaurant we went to on our girl's weekend and it held up to all of our expectations!!!We went on Valentine's Day (so romantic...) and walked in around 9pm and ended up getting a place at the bar around 9:30 but would have had a table by 10 if we hadn't. Â For it being Valentine's Day, I was impressed with their wait time for get walk-ins. Not to mention the extremely friendly staff - everyone we encountered including the hostesses, waiters squeezing through us as we waited by the bar and bartenders who had the extreme patience of two single ladies drawing out their Valentine's Day dinner by ordering plate after plate.Drink:- Old-fashioned: Strong as hell. Seriously (pronounced srsssly by the end of two of those) but amazing and I wouldn't have wanted anything else paired with the foods we had.Food:- Goat empanadas (marinated sheep feta, pickled golden beets, tzatziki). I would never have imagined this. Ever. I would never have changed anything on it. Nothing at all. I didn't want to finish this - the crispy outside and the soft shredded goat inside was insane. Goats feta is the only feta i like and this one was crazy good. I know I am throwing out huge words nonstop but that's srssssssly how we felt! Damn.- Goat Carpaccio (smoked trout roe & olive-maple vinaigrette) This was great. Loved the flavour but it was the meat itself that was crazy fresh and delicious. It fell apart easier than any carpaccio I've had before. The trout flavour was a great pair with the carpaccio, again so different and lovely.- Kusshi*my favourite oysters* (raw; muscatel mignonette, tarragon). Loved it. Just loved it.- Baby Octopus (guanciale, beans, pistachios, lemon vinaigrette) THE BEST ITEM WE HAD. HANDS DOWN. So lemony and delicious with perfectly grilled octopus and crunchy beans. Atmosphere:I found it great at the bar, I love sitting at the bar I find it's so much more fun to interact with the people around you and get the entire experience out of the restaurant. We got to enjoy the decor of the restaurant from here. The shelves above the bar have these pieces that were so beautiful and each are a little different. We were told that they are from fireplace screens from an old mansion (I think mansion...if not, some other building - I think the drinks were done at this point). It was such a unique piece I loved it. Something about eating the best food in Â a beautiful restaurant started our weekend off on a great foot :) We walked across the street to find a bar and decided on the Lone Wolf...that's another review."
"AUGH. So amazingly good!! What an awesome time. I had really wanted to come here during my long weekend in Chicago, so my friend and I decided to take our chances and stop in. Other than being treated like a second-class citizen for not having a reservation (total wait time = 2 hours, with the hostess insisting almost the entire time that she couldn't give us an accurate estimate of when we'd be seated), this was a great experience and one I was happy to wait for.We got an adorable table for two in the middle of the restaurant and started our feast with bread with chipotle butter and pumpkin, suuuuper yummy. The plates we chose to share were the squash wontons with mushroom ragout, sauteed green beans, diver scallops, roasted pig face, and confit goat belly. Both of us agreed that the goat belly was our favorite dish, but really ALL of the food was just delicious, with intricate combinations of flavors and textures that worked so well. I also loved the squash wontons...the mushroom ragout isn't what you traditionally think of as a ""ragout,"" but a tasty broth-based sauce filled with a variety of delicious mushrooms. And I loved the pomegranate in the scallops dish...so amazing.Those 6 dishes, plus two glasses of wine came to about $100 which was NOT BAD. I will absolutely be back for a subsequent foodgasm the next time I'm in Chicago, though I will make my best efforts to score a reservation ahead of time. Until then, I bow down. Check out the food porn/photos!"
"I am from Los Angeles, and with my 8yo son had dinner at the Girl and the Goat. Â There is no ""Kid's Menu"" and my son is a true foodie, so it worked out great. Â We started with the escargot ravioli; and my son description that it's ""just alright"" is accurate. Â It is escargot after all. Â The halibut was wonderful....two thumbs up from my son; while the short rib was again very good, but my son gave it only one thumbs up. Â Our last dish was the duck breast, and it was amazing!!! Â My son gave it ""two thousands thumbs up."" Â We tried two desserts and they were both very rich and we couldn't finish them. Â The atmosphere was wonderful. Â I have to love a place that plays Cake and the Grateful Dead during fine dining. Â This place is a must for locals and travelers alike. Â It's obvious that they don't encourage the attendance of families and younger diners, however the staff treated us great and we never felt out of place. Â A wonderful time was had by both of us."
"I hadn't had any dental work done in quite a few years when I moved to Oak Park. Â I found the staff at Lawrence R. Fine & Associates invariably pleasant, helpful, and efficient. Â Dr. Kostal did some superb restorations on my teeth that were long overdue, with the very best of new techniques and first-class materials. Â They went out of their way to accommodate me and get all my work done before the imminent turnover of my insurance deductible. Â As far as dental work is concerned, I couldn't have asked for a better experience."
"We moved to Chicago in July and soon decided we would be hosting a big group for Thanksgiving of family and friends from all over the country. Â As soon as people RSVP'd to come, I immediately hopped on to look for a reservation for 10 - and lucked out that one was available the week of Turkey Day. Â Granted it was months in advance and at 5:30, we were really excited. Â We had wanted to go since we arrived, and were looking forward to sharing the experience with friends and family. Â We were seated at one of the huge rustic tables that are right in front of the kitchen. Â Lush, comfy chairs, such a table for community and conversation. Â I loved where we sat - it started the meal of perfectly, and that theme continued. Each person picked 2 dishes for the table and I tallied them all up on the menu. Â Then the bloodbath began. Â Granted this was a couple months ago, however there are a few dishes that I can still taste when I think about them. Roasted Cauliflower, Ham Frites (Fries dusted with ham dust!!), Skirt Steak, and the Sugo were my faves, although I think we had almost everything on the menu and everyone seriously loved and tried everything we ordered. . Â The cocktails and desserts were also amazing! Â I keep waiting for the craze for reservations to subside some, but it doesn't seem to be happening. Â I think its a testament to the restaurant. Â Atmosphere, quality and imagination, yet comfort of food, and impeccable service. We loved the experience and so did our family!"
"Loved it, call ahead and make reservations everything was great we had the pig face and duck tongue dessert was great too!"
"Love this restaurant! Menu changes with the Season. However we've noticed a few favorites remain like the Pork Shank, yum!!! Reservations a must! Price average. One off favorite restaurants downtown."
"4.5 stars for sure. Love the hustle & bustle of the place, it's oozing with style. Craft cocktails with perfectly balanced complexity. Food that speaks for itself, Stephanie Izard has got some game. We had about 12 dishes total, & most were pretty fantastic. Service was great, helpful hands at every turn for whatever you needed. It was very much what I expected my first visit to be. It seems the only bad reviews I read were people who really didn't know what they were getting into. ""Loud...man food...not good for children...expensive...plates coming out in an order we're not used to etc etc."" This is one of the most renowned farm to table/small plate restaurants in Chicago, and by extension, the country. Did you think it was going to be cheap & quiet? The only thing that really missed for me was the dessert. We had 2 items & they did not seem to be anywhere on par with the rest of the place. But no biggie, it was all well worth the 3 month advance reservation so we can make some friends jealous."
"Make reservations ahead of time. Â If you really want to try this place based on the number of reviews and stars and cannot get reservations, I'd suggest going there before they open otherwise, you'll have to eat at the bar or the lounge area, which is not that comfortable, in my opinion. Â We ordered:Green beans - addicting, salty, vinegary and mayonnaiseyGoat empanadas - I was scared because I've never tried goat, but it was pretty much like shredded pork. The shell of it was very crunchy. Â Reminded us of a taquito.Scallops - if you love scallops (or even like scallops) these were bomb diggity... period!Pig face - Delish! Â It had a lot of flavor. Â I think the egg added to the flavor or the pork.Shishito peppers - These were OK. Â Too much stuff on it, a little less would've been more.Everything we ordered was about $10-$20ish."
"Get ready for an experience. Be advised that a reservation may take a couple of months. Just reserve it and the day will come. The servers are very knowledgeable and they will not steer you wrong. You will walk out with almost a food coma, but we'll worth it. Everything is out of this world from the beginning to the end.One of the best restaurants I've ever been to."
"I hesitated to write a review for Girl & the Goat, I mean this restaurant has over 3000 reviews and 4.5 stars, can't get better than that and what can my review possibly add? But I decided to write this review anyway, is it more for myself? Is it for you all? I think the real reason is that I really liked the place a lot and this is my way of paying tribute to a great dining experience.First let me get the ""bad"" out of the way. This ""bad"" was minimal but I still remember it, and I shouldn't. I should only be remembering the amazing broccoli or the baby octopus. So, here goes. You guys refill customers' water glasses every 5 minutes, which is great, but when I went to the rest room the toilet was soiled. I recommend you clean the restrooms at least half as often as you refill the water glasses. Also, we arrived 20 minutes before our 7:30 reservation and were asked to wait, totally understandable. But why then did you seat us at 7:44? Not acceptable, sorry. And the music was way too loud. I could still converse with the 3 people in my party, but it was not effortless. I know some restaurants keep the noise level up to keep the customers pumped and ordering more drinks etc (it's true, look it up), but this is such a late 90s gimmick, come on. Finally, we once asked one of the bus boys if we could have another order of the bread and we were told ""you must ask your server"", verily?Anyway, everything else was amazing, starting with Taylor, our server. She was perfect. Polite and knowledgeable, fashionable and pleasant, nonintrusive and helpful, cheerful and genuine. Wow, thank you Taylor, and thanks for the great explanation of the meaning behind the big painting of the girl, goat, baby octopus and walking beer bottles (see? Now you have to come eat here to see what I mean!). Taylor is a huge asset to this place.The food was amazing. My comment is ""what they said"" (all the other great reviewers on here). I left thoroughly satisfied and happy, and I'll be back, hoping that the music will be a tad lower and the restrooms clean."
Tapas Style. So. Delicious. Everything!! Just a tip- the goat leg is 10 pounds so make sure you have a group to finish it :)
"In my Top 10 restaurants of all time...If you visit Chicago, you owe it to yourself to eat here. Â Brilliant cocktails are icing on the cake."
"About a month prior to visiting Chicago, I tried to book reservations for our party of 6, but there were no available reservations. So I informed my group that we will just arrive when it opens at 430pm and hope for the best.... and it looked like a lot of others had the same idea. We arrived at 425pm and there were several other parties waiting to be seated and people just kept coming in... and for good reason. The food is phenomenal and I would def come back to Girl & the Goat each time I visit Chicago.Our waitress Lindsay (who was so cool and fab, by the way) told us that we should typically order 2-3 plates for person. It really depends on the plate because we had 6 people and ordered 7 different plates, but 9 total and we were stuffed! Dishes by order of deliciousness:1. wood oven roasted PIG FACE Â (don't expect a pig face though - the name is deceiving, but still my fav dish)2. goat neck2. wood fired rappahannock oysters2. goat liver mousse 2. confit goat belly3. kona kampachi crudo 4. diver scallopsI know I have several dished listed as number 2, but I couldnt decide because they were so awesome. Pig face gets number 1 spot by itself because I was tempted to come back the next day and order it to go for my flight home.The atmosphere was so casual, yet trendy. It was laid back, but you wouldnt expect to see any bums there. I highly recommend going when they open if you dont have reservations. The place gets packed and bumping very quickly. The interior is beautiful. The host and hostesses were friendly even when I came in with my group of 6 and no reservation. Girl & the Goat.... I will be back!"
"Girl & the Goat is amazing, rivaling any niche food and cocktail joint that you would find in NYC.Start with some amazing vegetable dishes like grilled cauliflower with pine nuts, pickled peppers, and mint.Follow it up with some deep friend crispy duck tongues over tuna poke (seriously who buys duck tongues in bulk?)Then move to some escargot ravioli (this is the second place i've seen this month with escargot ravioli so let's hope it is a trend catching on)Go on to some baby octopus. Â I have to say, this was the only near-miss that I tried. Â The octopus was fine, though a little chewy for my tastes, but there's so much other stuff in salad that it is too heavy and overwhelming for what should be a light and delicate seafood dish.Move then to some confit goat belly topped with butter poached lobster and crab. Â HOLY CRAP THIS IS AMAZINGFinish it off with a miso butterscotch budinoThe cocktails here are great and the bartenders are the best you'll find in the midwest, so when you want to go off menu and challenge them with some special requests they have no problem. Â They have a nice selection of micro distillery liquors to work with like Fernet Leopold, Dorda, as well as some late harvest Tannat from Uruguay. Â They can do some interesting things with what's behind the bar so don't be afraid to push them!I can't wait to come back and try other things like the goat liver mousse and the goat carpaccio."
"Came here on a whim and basically had orgasms in my mouth the whole meal. Made a reservation for 2 on open table 2 days before going (super lucky, think somebody cancelled their reservation and I swooped in on it), and got seated quickly at the area by the kitchen. Best spot, just saying--got to see all the action AND we got a few dishes on the house (win!). Service was great, truly friendly and considerate, but let's talk food:Portions weren't that big, but I definitely felt stuffed at the end. Bread appetizer: I forgot which one we got, but it one with goat cheese. I thought it was good, but nothing special, so I wouldn't recommend getting this--waste of stomach spaceBeet salad: I'm usually not a fan of creamy salad dressing, but found this one to be yummy. It didn't have the rich/fatty taste, and was refreshing and flavorful. We saw the chefs make the Kohlrabi salad the most, so maybe that salad's the real deal, but the beet one was pretty good regardless.Lamb tartare: Delicious, but portion was a bit small. I liked that they put some veggies/greens in there with the meat, it complimented it well. Definitely left me yearning for more. Recommend. Pig face: The famous pig face! delicious, creamy, and melt-in-your-mouth. And of course, that fried egg on top just makes everything 100x better. Like a high-end spam, but with a pig tongue/cheek-y taste to it. Sauteed green beans (on the house): Cooked with an asian twist, but I found it to be a little too salty. Wasn't anything special.Goat loin: Oh my lord, this was seriously heaven in my mouth. Even though by the time this came out I was about to explode from all the prior delicious food, I had one bite and I was like ""Man, I need more of this!"". I would die happy if this was my last meal on earth. Cooked so well, the meat was so smooth and the sauce that came with it complimented it so nicely. Nice and tender, medium-rare-ish. Such flavor, much mouth-gasms. Portion was larger than I had expected, which was a nice surprise. Highly recommend, best thing I ate that night :) Desserts: Got the butterscotch miso budino on the house and ordered the rhubarb shortcake. They were good, but I wasn't wow-ed by any of them. I might have put high expectations on dessert though, since the rest of our meal was soooooo good. Price: For all of our food and a beer, it was $100 including tax/tip. I was surprised because I thought for the amount we ate, the tab would come out to be over 100. Although it is pricier than your average McDonald's dollar menu meal, I think it's reasonable for a special night out. I'd definitely come back. Not sure if I'd try coming without a reservation, so make sure you plan ahead!"
"3 of the best hours I've ever spent having dinner. I will begin with the service, from minute one is will impeccable and only got better. The GM and our server Monika made us feel as if we were there only table (speaking if that - although crowded and tables are close you feel like you are in your own little world) and they prepared all day for us to have a fabulous dinner. And dinner was fabulous...it was delicious...it was an experience. So let's talk food! The Kohlrabi salad was our starter and much to my surprise one of the best. The flavor is exceptional. Same with the goat empanadas - serious flavor punch! Speaking of goat (since we were at Girl & the Goat) the goat liver mousseline with crumpets - simply no words to describe. Simply loved it. As we did the octopus and scallops. The only bummer is by time we got to the green beans I was do full I could only eat a few - and those few were pretty darn tasty. We did a dessert sampling - it was very good. Lets just say bacon toffee with pineapple...With three of us ladies all flying in from different parts of the country to celebrate a 40th birthday all I can say is having dinner at Girl & the Goat made a special weekend all that more special and memorable. We will not forget this dinner!!!"
Food was excellent and service was impeccable. Â Creative menu that doesn't disappoint.
"Dinner at Girl & the Goat was one of those meals where you're happy to pay the bill when it arrives. It's a beautiful space, buzzing and busy, with an open kitchen. The service was great.Everything is small-ish plates served family style, which is my very favorite way to eat. All the food was interesting, original, and delicious. Some favorites were the Sauteed Green Beans (fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews), which were perfectly crisp-tender and ridiculously flavorful and Sugo (pappardelle with meat sauce, rosemary, and cape gooseberries).The Bolt Action cocktail (Wild Turkey Rare Breed, Blenheim's Ginger Ale, lemon, Angostura bitters) was amazing! And this is after having drinks at The Aviary, so it's saying something. The Spanish Harlem (Olmeca Altos Plata Tequila, Combier rose liquer, lemon) was nice as well.Overall, a really enjoyable evening."
"For the service I would give 2 STARS, our server was condescending, dismissive and non existent. She kinda ruined our experience there, made it unpleasant, and I'm not sure I will return.The food however was 4 stars!The hype about the food is real, everything is really delicious!My favorite items were the Octopus and the Pig face, really flavorful, I enjoyed every mouthful."
"A great bar. A great meal. The staff was casual and fun but smart and flawlessly well informed about the menu. Most plates are small, almost tapas size, so order a few to share. Everything we ordered was delicious, creative, innovative. The signature menu item was Pig Face and it was delicious. Don't be afraid of the name, it's the delicious cheek meat and the truly best part of the pig. Also, as the name indicates, there are several goat dishes. Try one. They are great. Classic craft cocktails made perfectly and served by stylishly tattooed, t shirt wearing bartenders without a hint of pretension."
"I had my favorite meal ever at Girl & the Goat. The environment was perfect from the start. The boyfriend and I didn't have a reservation, but we were more than content sitting in their bar/lounge area for a drink and appetizer while we waited. We were seated promptly. Our server gave us a great customer service experience. He really seemed to care, and that really strikes me as awesome. The drinks were impressive and tasty. The margarita hit the spot perfectly. The way that the food is meant to be had is for your party to order many of the small dishes and share. Everything that we ordered was absolutely amazing. The food was creative and beyond delicious. I can't recommend this place enough."
"I have to say overall, it was a superb experience.I didn't want to let all the hype surrounding this place influence my decision, so I let the food do the talking.Environment: very nice. Dark and I'd say a mix between rustic and industrial.Presentation: excellent!Let me start by saying that David recommended 4-5 for a table of 2. The dishes aren't small but also are not traditional dinner plateHere is the food we ordered and order it came out (NOTE: typically Bread would come first but I ordered it a couple minutes after David took our food order).1.Loup de Mer2.ham frites3. Johnny Applecheese Bread4. Pig Face5 Confit Goat BellyThe Loup de Mer is a seabass with sweet and sour sauce. This was awesome! One of the best tasting fish I've had.Ham frites - just an all around great combination especially with the aioli and cheddar beer sauce!Johnny Applecheese- that cheesy butter was amazing, however I probably could have done without the apple oil.Pig Face - Oh man, this was some damn good pig. Right amount of fat and meat. Great job on this!COnfit Goat Belly - Their version of surf and turf. To be honest, I wasn't in love with this. The crab and lobster was pretty good, but not great. The goat was merely okay. I felt it was over salted, and didn't have a wow factor. I do believe that maybe the Goat following the Pig may have made it difficult to appreciate the goat, but there really wasn't any thing that made the dish stand out to my girlfriend or I. To follow dinner we had the peaches and blueberry buckle. Fantastic choice!Overall, the experience was phenomenal, and David's service was a big part of that; he made my Girlfriend and I feel very welcome on our anniversary. I hope to visit again soon!"
"Had an amazing time here for an anniversary dinner. The service was great, and the food was even better. We were feeling daring, so we went on a Sunday night without a reservation. We were quoted about a 30 minute wait, and went to the bar for a drink. We hadn't even finished our cocktails (both very good, but the recommendation was a bit off for my boyfriend's, and he found his to be too sweet) when we were shown to our table. Significantly less than 30 minutes! We were very impressed, as the place was extremely packed.Our server was helpful in helping us navigate the menu and find a good amount of food to order. He guided us, and made great suggestions without it seeming like he was trying to upsell us.Everything was super delicious, I had the smoked broccoli with rice krispies, and I truly believe everyone should try it. It was one of the most unique flavors I have ever experienced. Â I'll admit that I was prepared for this meal to cost about 2x my monthly budget for food, but the bill was surprisingly well under what we anticipated, and it was a nice treat for us without breaking the bank.The overall decor and vibe of this place was very trendy and cool, but without the corresponding cooler-than-you attitude these places can sometimes embody. I would definitely return for another special occasion!"
"We went here with a group of 9 girls and had Danielle as our server. First of all, she's AMAZING, and took such good care of us. Secondly, she's incredibly knowledgable and helped our lactose-intolerant diner navigate the menu with ease. Because there we're so many with us we did the ""chef's choice"" and had the kitchen send out the dishes without us actually ordering anything. Highlights included:EmpanadasPig facePork shank (to die for)HalibutCauliflower Budino (for dessert)But absolutely everything was amazing! I highly recommend this place!"
"Another great dinner and drinks here. Pork Shank all the way & the fries are crazy good. Â They have these peppers that I could eat all day, everyday.. So yummy!! We had the scallops that were good, and the blue point oysters.. It was a mistake on my part. I assumed the oysters were small, but they were bigger than what I normally like. Great staff & ambiance. Overall.. Another great evening"
"The sauteed green beans are like no other green beans you have ever had before! Â The apple and miso butter with bread was yummy. Â The escargot ravioli was sublime and the pig face was to die for. Â Extremely busy and crowded place so make sure you have reservations well ahead of time. Â Also, the small plates are meant for sharing because sharing is caring. :) Â It gives you the chance to try a bunch of things. Â Oh! Â Almost forgot...they serve Stumptown Â coffee!!! Â I was super excited to see it on their menu after days of drinking Starbucks in the windy city. Â Looooove the little Northwest coffeeshops and excited to see the caffeine shared across the great distance."
"100% worth the hype. My three friends and I had a reservation at 5:45 which we had made months in advance. The place itself was beautiful and was already packed. The service was great and very nice.Onion bread - this bread was delicious and fluffy. Both the tarragon butter and the pepper chutney were delicious.Pan fried shishito peppers - these were great, but not a highlight. I liked the combo of the parmesan and miso.Roasted cauliflower - one of my two favorites (the other being the duck tongues). I am not generally a cauliflower lover, but these were seasoned perfectly and a bit spicy.Roasted beets - we had these without the anchovies, because we were dining with a vegetarian. The crunchiness of the breadcrumbs really added something.Chickpea fritters - delicious. Fried perfectly and not greasy at all. The texture was almost tofu-like. Highly recommend these.Grilled baby octopus - this was the table's favorite. I loved it as well, but I felt that the mustard taste (must have been mustard greens?) came on slightly too strong.Duck tongues - absolutely amazing. The duck tongues were fried and crispy. They were combined with raw tuna and black beans. Oddest combination, but amazing.Beef tongue - the beef tongue itself was cooked perfectly, but I thought it was too much with the masa. I thought the masa paired well with the salsa verde, and the tongue paired well with the salsa verde, but the tongue and the masa were too much together.Wood fired wellfleet oysters - the only thing I thought was mediocre. Wouldn't recommend these.Goat loin with salsify and kumquat - the goat was perfectly cooked at medium rare. The jus was perfect and I thought the salsify was a great match. I thought the kumquats overpowered the goat and salsify, but I think that's a personal thing, because I always feel kumquats overpower whatever they are in.Sticky date cake - delicious. The cake/almond halva/whipped yogurt combo was amazing. Again, I felt the kumquat overpowered the rest, but I just set it to the side.Epic dining experience, and I would go back in a second."
"Excellent place for creative and wonderfully delish food. Most of the times I have been here has been with friends or my significant other. So reservations are necessary. One should plan to get them as soon as possible. Otherwise, a good tip is to pop in and see if the lounge has seating. It is first come first served. Many of them people who sit in the lounge are waiting for their tables. The pig face is excellent. This week I had goat neck, which was a amazing. All of the vegetable dishes were innovative and delicious. The squash bloom rangoons were yummy!!! Â Drinks are excellent too!"
Would go back in 1 second! Amazing experience!!! My husband and I celebrated our anniversary and it could not have been more enjoyable! Such unique and tasty food! LOVED LOVED LOVED it!!!
"The pig face is amazing. A friend and I came here and after we ordered our first pig face, we ordered ANOTHER one when our server asked if we wanted dessert. It's that good. Also order: - The goat empanadas - The summer tom bread"
"Food was amazing. Smells, ambiance were incredible. Service... good. I'm a fan of the pig but the goat was yummy. Too bad ""the girl"" was in Taiwan. We would have loved to see her in action."
The best dining experience and food in my life. This will be a staple on every Chicago trip. Never had a meal so good.
Amazing place. Get plates to share. Nothing is off limits. Friendly staff helps. Great atmosphere too!
Where can I start without sounding like a windbag. All around great service with even better dishes to match. This place came highly recommended by a great friend and did not disappoint. Do not miss out on the Pig Face...
"Tasty, tasty, tasty! Also saw the owner, Top Chef winner, Stephanie Izard as she was standing next to me at the bar for quite a while, mingling with her friends. Â Had to get the famous pig face! Â Was it delicious, yes it was! Small portion, but if it was any bigger, it would be too heavy! Â Also had the cauliflower (too much cheese), baby octopus (delicious!), goat meatballs with a blackberry cabbage slaw ( not memorable), fried pickles (way too much batter) but superb dipping sauces, Sticky date cake (YUMMMMM!) and the butterscotch budino (interesting, but not worth getting again).I think I could have had a way better tasting experience by ordering a few other dishes, but the few ones that I did have that were amazing are enough for me to rave about this place and come back when in the area!"
"Got reservations over 2 months in advance and was so excited to try this place! Â Had an amazing meal! Â Kohlrabi salad, roasted cauliflower, pig face, & goat confit - all amazing and unique dishes. They even gave us complimentary goat empanadas which were fantastic. Service was impeccable and our server was super helpful and personable. We got seated at the kitchen counter and had a great time interacting with and watching the line chefs do their thing. Â The food truly was exquisite and the price surprisingly very reasonable."
"Was in town on business and took the advice from 4000 Yelpers. What a feast! Pig Face, pork belly and goat bellow were unbelievable. The butterscotch desert was great as well. You probably could not go wrong to blindly point your finger at the menu and order whatever your finger lands on. Great restaurant."
"I went again over the weekend since my family was visiting from out of town. The entire experience was one of the family favorites for their visit!We arrived at 4:30pm. WAY too early to eat, so I just put our name down and we grabbed a drink across the street. By the time we got back, it was 5:15pm and they said it would be a 2 hour wait. WHAT??? Uhmm...OK. We'll just hang around and see if spots open up at the bar. Oh wait, what? Someone cancelled? OK! We're down to take that spot! It was right in front of the kitchen area, so it was cool watching all the cooks do their thang. I enjoyed my Best of Three last time, so I had two of those to enjoy with my dinner.Since we had more people this time, we were able to order a lot more dishes to try. The pig face is still my favorite out of all the dishes. HAHA. But all of them were excellent! We had to go with the bread, pig face, and cauliflower. Our server recommended the green beans, and I am SO glad that he did. It was my next favorite veggie dish.The sea bass was delicious, flakey, moist, and very well balanced with all the other ingredients on the plate. I don't even remember what was on there, but it was gobbled up in a hot second. The roasted chicken came with deep fried pickles -- we weren't too impressed with the chicken, and it was red. We are ok with a little bit of pink, but we weren't comfortable with that amount of blood on our poultry. We sent it back and asked them to take it off our receipt. I wish they would have been a little more apologetic about it (because everything else was excellent)...we're not the types to be all finicky with that kind of stuff. Eh. Whatevs. Overall, we had such a great experience that it didn't dampen our spirits.I almost forgot. We got one of the goat dishes. I am not a huge fan of goat, so I only tried a taste of the Confit Goat Belly. I'm sure for goat lovers out there, they would have loved the dish. My dad certainly did."
"I've been meaning to get to this spot for quite a while and it lives up to all the buzz. Â Everything is set up to share and my friends and I started with goat liver pate which is severed with a peach jam and some pickles. Â The shishito peppers and roasted cauliflower came next and were fantastic - tons of flavors and our waitress provided solid beer suggestions. Â We indulged in the grilled octopus, escargot ravioli and grilled beef ribs and loved every bite. Â Glad we left some room for dessert as the miso butterscotch budino was amazing! Â Hoping to get back soon as it was a great experience."
"You have over 2K reviews on this place. Nothing new for me to say other than it is awesome. Everything you eat will touch on different flavors and my 9 year old son loved it too. Not to mention that its not stuffy but very friendly even toward our little guy.I had to try the espresso since I had seen how they went to great lengths to find the perfect coffee bean. It was delicious. Reminded me of Cuban coffee but smoother. This is hands down a restaurant that should be on your bucket list to check off again, and again and again."
"Have been here three times in the last three years and felt that it was worth the wait/money each time. First time was a date night, with reservations made well in advance. We were hesitant about the restaurant's high profile, as we don't consider ourselves ""foodies"" (although, we totally appreciate good food!) but were surprised at how laid back and not at all pretentious the environment was. Second time here was a spontaneous decision with some family visiting from out of town on a warm weekday evening-- we opted to wait in the bar area for some space to open up at an outdoor table and were seated within 30 minutes around 6:30pm. The most recent visit was for a work outing with two other couples. Each experience was unique, regarding the company (date night, family meal, work colleagues), food (seasonal menu) and personal tastes around the table. Even though the menu is not very big, it seems there are always several options that will appeal to everyone, and that worked so well in a larger group. The indoor and outdoor space is warm, inviting and great for everything except intimate conversation, as it is pretty loud inside. But even on our date night, we loved the ambiance. The waitstaff are so knowledgeable and always seem to make great recommendations. On our visit with family, our server brought us a large plate of oysters on the house, which was a great touch. Memorable plates (can't remember the menu names, and some of these are from menus years back):BREAD -- I loved going with a big group, because it meant we didn't have to pick just one. Sooo good.pork bellypig facegrilled broccoli - we still talk about this, and have also tried recreating it at homegreen beans in fish saucequaillamb shankI've never come here and not tried something that was totally different than anything I've ever had. And as far as I can remember, the result has always been delicious. If there was ever a dish that was not satisfying, I've forgotten it :) Overall, I've always left feeling like it was an excellent dining experience worthy of the top-notch reviews."
"I heard this place gets crazy packed so I did what any crazy person would do....show up exactly at opening hours which was 4:30. Â Okay, I also finished exploring everything on my schedule and had nothing else to do =/I guess nobody eats this early because it was somewhat empty. Â Anyway, I sat at the bar because that's what I've been doing during my trip here in Chicago. Â Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face- So tender and flavorful. Â Goat Belly- DeliciousService was just as good as the food."
"The best cauliflower dish I have ever had! I don't eat meat, but I was more that satisfied by the veggie options they had. There were some potstickers that sucked (the skins were too thick and mushy) but everything else was delicious."
"The opinion of this tourist from Los Angeles, This was perhaps one of the best dinning experiences I've ever had. I was in Chicago on business and wanted to check this place out. I made my reservations a month in advance and it was totally worth it. As a friend described on my Instagram ""this is some sexy ass food."" I couldn't agree more but indeed it taste even better than it looked. If you're going to be in Chicago, you need to put Girl and Goat on your ""must do"" list alongside Wrigley Field, Signature Room and an architectural boat tour."
"Can't say enough good things about Girl & the Goat! Called on Friday early afternoon (weekend of the Chicago Marathon, so super busy tourist time), and asked about reservations. The person on the phone mentioned they were all booked, but suggested we swing by earlier in the night around 5-5:30 and said we should have luck sitting at the bar -- and we did!Ordered five different items all at the waitresses suggestions: green beans, pig face, fried oysters, duck empanadas and dumplings. For two this was PLENTY of food. All came spaced apart and perfectly timed for us to enjoy each item and not feel rushed - did I mention each thing was absolutely delicious? The must have's: pig face, fried oysters and green beans.We then said we were too full to consider dessert but we're surprised with an ""on the house"" small order of the apple buckle came. The best dessert I've ever had, ever. I don't care how full you are after dinner, order the apple buckle.Thanks again to the fun, energetic, amazing staff for the delicious, unforgettable dinner!"
"Goatgasm. That's what I had. That's not the technical term for the dish, but I think that's a word that best describes what I shoved in my mouth and savored. Heyo!We had a couples' night out consisting of six people. Our friend was gracious enough to coordinate everything, so we wound up with a reservation at 10:30pm on Friday, December 14th. The spot was secured in September... You read that right. If you want a goat leg dinner, be prepared to wait up to three months for it.But it's worth it. Oh God, is it worth it!We started off the evening with the Pretzel Bread. Bread comes at additional cost, but you get so full on the other items that you really don't need that much. A little loaf was enough for all of us to sample and I discovered that I really enjoyed the mustard spread that came with it, despite the fact that I typically do not like mustard.We each ordered a small plate to share and a couple extra plates. My favorites were the Pork Cheek and the Parmesan/Goat Cheese Peppers. We also had Crudo, Roasted Cauliflower, Goat Empanadas, Baby Octopus and Duck Leg. I enjoyed everything. Everyone agreed the peppers were definitely worth ordering again.The table favorite for cocktail was the Best of Three. There's a ginger cocktail that's also very good and they have a nice beer menu.The star of the show was the goat leg. As I mentioned, you must order it in advance. You can make reservations as they roll out and you don't need to specify if you'll be getting the leg at that time, but you do need to give them a decent amount of advance warning that your group will want this. We ended up with a 6 lbs goat leg. It comes bone-in, but there really isn't that much meat missing from it after you take the bones out. We were sufficiently stuffed because they serve it with a side of pocket bread and a ton of dipping sauces.Dessert, for me, was a bit of a let down. I ordered the Pumpkin Pie Gelato. It was tasty, but the consistency was a bit strange. Everyone was a bit put off by it, so I'd skip that next time. However, they change their menu quite often, so maybe there will be a dessert I absolutely love the next time around. And I do intend to come back as soon as possible."
I have been 5 times. Each time we attempt new menu items and specials. Reservations have not always been easy to get at peak times but its worth waiting for.
"as good as expected (even with a Tuesday at 9:45 pm reservation made months ahead of time!) pig face is a must, just like heaven and no where near as repulsive looking as it may sound. it's just beyond delicious! escargot ravioli seemed quite random but was actually really good. would love to return and go deeper into the menu, at an earlier hour :)"
Took the lady out to girl and the goat for our 1yr anniversary and had an awesome experience! The host even congratulated us on our 1 yr mark. The staff was very nice and friendly and I have to say it was the best service I've received thus far. The chef even complemented us with desert on the house! This is how a restaurant should run. Kudos to girl and the goat. Definitely will be stopping by there again soon! Oh and can't forget about the food. Everything was amazing and had all kinda of flavors.

"Wow we are so lucky! Got a reservation through Opentable 2 days before our visit! Whenever we visit Chicago, this restaurant is always on the top of our list. I have been here at least 5 times.... And I live in California. I go here more than some restaurants in SF. The signature dishes that are a must: braised pork shank, Roasted cauliflower, & Wood oven roasted pig face! (You can read more in my previous review.)They are always good & You will never be disappointed... Ever! Service is top notch. Will I ever come back? Heck Yeah!!!!Thank you Stephanie!"
"Wow. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this place?!Girl and the Goat is one helluva place to get into... but if you are lucky enough to get reservations, you definitely wont regret this dining exprerience. The decor of the restaurant is relatevely rustic looking and casual. I am currently living in Munich, Germany - but I am originally from Chicago. Girl and the Goat opened a little before my fiancee and I moved to Germany, and unfortunately we were not lucky enough to get reservations prior to our depature. HOWEVER! This summer we were back for a visit, so as soon as we booked our flights I went to OpenTable to see if I could get a reservation. Sure enough I was able to get (what looked like) one of the last slots for a Sunday night - at 5:30 pm. Please keep in mind that I made this reservation for 4 people, approximately 5 months before the reserevation!Anywho, our server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful. She explained that we should get 7-8 plates to split between the four of us. After looking at the menu, we did not need any arm pulling to push us to order 7-8 plates - almost everything looked exteremly delicious. We ordered raw oysters, green beans, goat belly, chickpea fritters, scallops, pig face, fried zucchini flowers, and lamb stuffed calamari... as well as two bottles of wine :). The oysters were beautifully prepared and melted in your mouth. I did not get any briney taste - which is one thing that I missed a little, but the garnish of ginger and other spices made up for that. The green beans... HOLY MOLY - so delicious. They are served in this sauce that is delicious enough to want to bathe in. We later found out (at the end of our meal) that this sauce is also sold by the bottle - naturally, we bought some to take with us ;).Out of all the dishes we had, I would have to say that the confit goat belly was the most disappointing. On paper, it looks absolutely delicious, but when you tasted it... well, it was strangely sweet. Although it did not say on the menu, it tasted like there was vanilla added to the dish - which mixed with the bits of lobster was actually off putting. The chickpea fritters were probably my favorite dish of the night (or at least tied with the green beans and the pig face). They were served with a variety of pickled veggies - which my friends (who had been there before) said were different from when they were there last... so I assume they change the veggies based on the season. The wood fired scallops were cooked to perfection, and also were melt-in-your-mouth delicious. The zucchini blossoms were relatively standard... nothing to write home about when compared to the other dishes. The Pig Face.... mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. What an amazingly tastebud frenzy of excitement! Everyone needs to try it. I don't really want to go into too much detail about the dish, because everyone should go in not knowing what to expect. However, know this, it is NOT an actual face. The lamb stuffed calamari were good... calamari were not over cooked, and everything was seasoned nicely. All in all it was a GREAT culinary experience, and I would most definitely go back again... and again."
"It's as good as it gets in the west loop. The second time here proved this place to be amazing. I came here on a last minute reservation made the day before by a friend for another friend's birthday party - service was wonderful, food was delicious and also at the perfect proportion so while we stuffed ourselves we weren't uncomfortably bloating. Definitely ask your server for recommendations because they know better than most and in general keep an open mind about the food! Don't not order something just because it's ""pig face"" and you feel yucked out by it. This is a vibrant restaurant perfect for a weekend night or just anytime you want to escape mundane life and indulge in some good food. The first time I've been, I reserved three months ahead of time and was super excited, but somehow did not end up ordering the right food. It was slightly above average for new American food and the atmosphere was enticing, yet the food we ordered was a little too greasy for my 10 p.m. stomach and while I enjoyed 80% it wasn't as spectacular."
"What a great experience. Â Great upbeat atmosphere, concise yet non intimidating beer list, great variety featured on the menu, and great service. Â That menu could be a bit daunting, but the servers were right on the game, and knew exactly what they were talking about. Â Some top shelf training right there. Â I love the family style dining options. Â We could have tried more had we been there with more than just two people, but we were still able to try 5 or 6 dishes, and each were quite amazing. Â Each dish was comprised of numerous components that really came together nicely. Â Individually, some of the flavors on the plate were lacking, but once it was all consumed together, you can see where they each fit.Very hard to get into, but I think with a little foresight you will have no problem getting in. Â And I would highly recommend it!"
"We really had a pleasant experience at the restaurant. It is a bit eclectic and the menu is certainly different from most, having options such as duck tongues and pig face. However, we had a group ready to try different things, so the interesting menu options were exciting to us.Our large group ordered several options from the menu, which is like a variety of appetizers. This included the above two items and others from the fish and veggie options. All of the items came quickly and were prepared very well. Portion size was average, but everything we sampled was excellent and the service was also top notch.The restaurant is highly recommended and I suggest that you try some things that you might not otherwise do!"
"Been trying to have dinner here for a couple years. It's got to be great since they are always packed, right? I was not very impressed. The food was tasty, but extremely fatty. Â The atmosphere was upbeat, but the tables are so close together that the tables on both sides of us were completely into our table's conversation. Service was great. The valet was awesome!We had onion bread, kohlrabi salad, goat empanadas, escargot ravioli, fries with beer cheese and pig face (you're a pig face!). Most of the table did not enjoy the pig face- it was all one texture (flabby) and super fatty. Â The consensus was the goat empanada was the best dish. While I would totally be willing to go back with a group that really wanted to try it, I don't think it's a restaurant I will ever seek out again."
"My friends and I visited this place over the weekend. Â We were unable to make reservations, so we braced ourselves for a possible 2-hour wait. Â We got there and were informed that it might be a 45-minute wait. Â We went to the bar, ordered drinks, and maybe 15 minutes later were told that we would be seated because someone had cancelled a reservation. Â Great for us! Â We ordered the shishito peppers, the pan roasted halibut, goat empanadas, soft-shell crab, and peanut butter bread. Â The shishito peppers and the halibut were AMAZING! If I were to rate Girl & the Goat solely for these two items, I would give 5 stars.The empanadas were good, peanut butter bread, and crab were good, but I probably would not order them again."
"Such a great meal, I hope to go there again soon!"
"Any time I had visitors in the city I took them to this amazing restaurant.Make sure you are willing to have a culinary experience and open your palate to try new things, feel adventurous and I can guarantee you will love it.Make sure to make a reservation or be ready to wait for around an hour on weekends, you can also go across the street for a drink while waiting for your table."
I came here once with my boyfriend. By the time we left we were making reservations to come back here again. Fast forward 2 months later and we got our second reservation. The food here is fantastic. The cauliflower will seriously blow your mind. The pig face was delicious and so was the pork shank. I will definitely be coming here again and will recommend this place to anyone!
"I was pleased to have the opportunity to eat here during my stay in Chicago. Â After countless hours of researching restaurants in the windy city and narrowing the places where I was to eat at down to a select few (countless hours = religously reading yelp reviews for a month), Â it was decided that Girl & the Goat was going to be the dining highlight of the week (Alinea, I'm coming for you next). Â Reservations had to be made months in advance, as this place is still one of the biggest hot spots in the city. Â The restaurant's interior was fun. Â Kind of a weird adjective to describe a restaurant but it was a very energetic and hip atmosphere. Â The food was excellent. Â Tapas sized portions is the name of the game here, and we ordered a good 7 or 8. Â The waitress was great at explaining each and every aspect of the plates on the menu, and gave us her tidbits on what both she enjoyed the most, and what patrons enjoyed the most. Â Beet salads, chicpea fritters, blueberry sea halibut, oven roasted pig face, quail, everything was delicious here. Â Chicago is lucky to call this restaurant their own. Â Side note: Â Imagine an out of towner's disappointment when it is discovered that Zombie Dust does not flow like water at every bar and restaurant in the Chicago area. Â Settling for Gumballhead isn't a bad consolation prize."
"I just got back from a long anticipated visit to Girl and the Goat. Â I made reservations two months ago and I have to say this place was a real disappointment. Â A great experience starts with a great server. Â Our server was just okay, she didn't go out of her way to make recommendations. Â We basically had to pull teeth to get some suggestions from her. Â We ordered the chickpea fritters, if you've ever had Indian food these fritters tasted just like under seasoned pakoras in a fancy bowl with fruit. Â We also ordered the goat empanadas which had no flavor and not to mention two small pieces for $16! Seriously? Skip the empanadas because there is nothing that made our palettes dance with excitement. Next, we decided to order the calamari bruschetta, which was a few pieces of french bread with calamari rings and green tomatoes. Â By this time, my husband and I were ready to run out the door.........the calamari bruschetta was just okay, nothing that we would order again. Â Lastly, we had the crispy pork shank. This entree was probably the better of the four that we ordered. Â The buttermilk dressing didn't have any flavor and the accompaniment of naan bread didn't make a lot of sense. Â The pork did have a nice crispy outer skin and the orange sauce did have some flavor. Â Our server just came over once to check in on us........really sad. Â When we got our last course, I asked the busboy for new plates (since they gave us new plates for each course before) and he glared at me like my request was unacceptable. Â I dropped over a $100 for small portion sizes and food that lacked flavor. Â Folks, don't fall for the hype. Â Save your money and go to a place that has stellar service, a welcoming atmosphere and food that will have you coming back for more, Â I certainly won't be coming back here again,"
"I was able to get into this place because I jumped into a reservation that was made by someone well in advance. This place has so many rave reviews that I knew there was no way anywhere could live up to the expectations. It was still very good. Since it is always so packed, it's very loud and we were sat at a shared table. Out of the appetizers I tried, I liked the cauliflower the most. I have never even thought to pickle it, but I am glad they did. The scallops were cooked perfectly and very tasty. My favorite part of the meal was the goat empanada. I am very happy about this too, as goat is in the title, so it better be good. To be honest, this is a good place but all the hype surrounding it, makes it into a tourist trap and I know there's other great places to try in the city."
"Yes. It is everything you can hope for in a restaurant. From the moment you come in till you leave you are in a whirlwind of fantastic food and drink. Food wise you can get a little bit of everything. Oysters, mussels, octopus, goat, pork, chicken, and beef. This place is a carnivore's dream. But on the other end you have an amazing selection of vegetarian options. The last time I went I got the celery root pierogi and I have to say it almost beat the delectable pig face that is the star on the meat section of the menu. The pig face alone is worth coming. It it everything that is good about pork:Fatty, salty, meaty, and delicate. Topped with a egg sunny side up it may be the best thing I have ever eaten. They also have a fantastic drink and beer menu and a knowledgeable staff that is quick to serve and please. Really one of the best places you can eat on the planet. Worth the price and the wait. Start looking for reservations now!"
"WARNING: Â NOT EVERY DISH IS DELICIOUS- CONSULT YOUR SERVER BEFORE ORDERING!!!The atmosphere is fantastic. Â I love being able to look at the kitchen!Not every dish is delicious. Â Talk to your server. Â Our server knew it was our first time but just took our order and left. Â He actually said- circle what you want on the menu. Â Didn't explain anything. Â We were fooled into ordering some things that were gross. Â Some dishes were unexpectedly fantastic.Nice atmosphere. Â Is it worth the 6-month wait for a reservation? Â Probably not, but reserve anyway, and when the date comes, go and have fun. Â Just make sure to talk to your waiter before you go crazy ordering everything."
Hmm - heavy heavy heavy heavy is the best start to reviewing this one I can make. The staff was fantastic - the vibe inside is great. Drinks are awesome. Our awesome bartender said 4-6 dishes for us two - and that was his only poor side of information for us anyway. We got through 1/2 of the 4th plate and almost threw up - have not been this full since my last recklessly painful thanksgiving. I'm writing this the day after and I still don't feel right. I get it - cool collaborations of ingredients on a single menu. But the price of heavy recipes is something to consider before ordering in bulk. In hind sight this was a night to get a couple plates and drinks and see how it goes from there. The 2 stars are for the effort - but I can do without the heaviness. Â I would hate to see the nutritional information on this place.
"It's so often written in reviews for places with a high number of them (this would be the 1,947th) ""What can I say which already hasn't been said?"" or ""I don't think I have anything to add, but..."" Well, I think in spots like this which change their menu often, drop items, add new ones, and tweak their few standard dishes frequently it's helpful because it provides fresh intel (ex: I believe the item we ordered is prepared differently each season).Girl & the Goat and Chef Izard are highly acclaimed. We were in the area and after speaking to a delightful employee outside decided to try it. The vacant seat on the sofa was snaked by a couple so we sat at the bar. Since we had just ate a wonderful dinner and it was late we got a nightcap and snack. The bartender told us the Pig Face and Goat Leg were their signature dishes so we went with the Pig Face. We also ordered the Best of Three cocktail (with Russian Standard vodka, Pimms #1, cucumber and lime) and a Cider. The Best of Three was delicious. Very refreshing and we both liked it. The cider he didn't care for so I finished it. The wood oven roasted pig face comes with a sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro sauce, red wine-maple, and fried potato stix. You swirl it all up and dig in. All the elements reminded us almost of a breakfast dish. The meat was cut into pieces and vaguely bacon-y taste. The sweet of the red wine and maple infused the potato stix. The cilantro sauce was almost more of a garnish, which is good since that taste can over balance an already intense dish. We liked the inclusion of the egg. It was rich, sweet, and salty.The service here is very friendly and knowledgeable. I had a fun conversation with the manager (a GQ looking man). He mentioned when I asked the Pig Face and Cauliflower are standouts on the menu and we talked a bit about the Goat and Little Goat. The atmosphere is lively. My companion felt the decor and lighting reminded him a bit of a steakhouse. I liked it is low-key and modern. The music is an interesting mix of modern alternative. I heard Phoenix and maybe MGNT. They have chefs tables at a bar facing the kitchen which would be fun to dine at. From were we sat we could see into the open kitchen which was cool seeing them gracefully make magic.The menu has a lot of accessible ingredients presented in innovative ways. I look forward to trying more small plates, enjoying a yummy cocktail, and the terrific hospitality."
Great experience. Make sure to go with people who are willing to try adventurous food! The green beans were a favorite.
"This is my favorite Chicago restaurant!!! Â  We first fell in love with the Chef (Stephanie Izard) during her appearance on Top Chef so, while in Chicago, we naturally had to try it! And we are glad we did. Â I have been there multiple times as I always dine there when in ChiTown. Â I love their ambiance. Â Great dÃ©cor and the place is always buzzing. Sat at the bar for dinner once with a buddy while visiting Chicago for a Miami Heat game. Â We had a blast!!! Â This place is always crazy busy and you will wait for your table pretty much every time. Â But the bar area is solid and the staff does a phenomenal job getting to you while you wait. Once seated, go for it. Â I can't remember ever ordering something I didn't enjoy. Small portions so go crazy. Â We always do!!!As for wine, the restaurant has a nice list of wines in all price ranges. The Special Select Rocco for $80 is a must if it's on the list. I believe they also have a $25 corkage fee. Verify and if they do, bring your own bottle of wine. Â It's well worth it."
"Two words... PIG. FACE. The food here is inspiring. The dishes are so thought out and flavors so developed. The food is not unique just for the sake of being different. It's unique because someone thought outside the box when building this menu. Service, cocktails, atmosphere and food are all money. I can't wait to go back next time I'm in Chicago."
"We had heard good this about this restaurant, so we made a point of making an Open Table reservation here during our short visit from California in June 2014. Â It was a Thursday night and super crowded. Â It did not start off well. Â Despite our reservation, made many weeks in advance, we had to wait for over 30 minutes for our table. Â We stayed close to the front desk so they would clearly see us the whole time, but that didn't help, and the host/hostess staff seemed very unfriendly and unhelpful, despite the fact that they forgot about us. Â A management person seemed to intervene and was very apologetic, but it was inexcusable. It got a lot better once seated. Â Gary, our server was really good. Â Two of the four our us are gluten-free, and he was really helpful with explaining ingredients. Also, they comped us a dish of goat empanadas as a nice gesture since we had the delay.The food was really good. Â We never had goat before, and it was tasty. Â The non-goat dishes were especially good. We had: roasted cauliflower (really good), chickpea fritter (excellent), gouda and bacon (really good), pig face (excellent), goat shank (good), confit goat belly with lobster & crab (really good), broccoli (good), The beer choices were quite extensive. The gluten-free bread was really good.For dessert we had the budino, which was okay. Â The decaf coffee was really good. Â On the whole, the great food more than offset the problematic host/hostess crew. Â The food was quite memorable, I would definitely come back if we come out this way again."
Everything is delicious... Veggies... Bread... Halibut (maybe the best ever)... Oysters... Pork... Dessert... And the cocktails are strong! Yum!
I tried this as I heard this is a restaurant by a top chef. This place is really busy and food is great. The dishes we ordered had a lot of flavor combined together.
"I had the pleasure of eating at Girl and the Goat last weekend. It was amazing, the waitstaff was so great and helped my party of 10 with everything that we needed. Â The music and vibe were very fun and perfect for a fun night out. Â The goat leg was AMAZING. Â I am usually called a picky eater but I had to try this menu option. Â It was the best decision that I could have made. Â Highly recommended!"
"I would give this place a 5 stars if the wait to eat here wasn't 3-6 months long. In any event, I couldn't leave Chicago without eating here and you betcha that this girl was on a mission. I called to ask them when there business slowed down and they told me 9pm. Quite honesty, I check my phone a few times to see when it died down a little bit and I say that it was closer to 1030 than 9pm. We went on a Monday night and had four girls. They told us the wait for the dining area was between 1.5 to 2 hours for walk in. So we went to the lounge/bar area and see if we can have better luck there. After waiting for about 20 mins, we managed to get bar seating. SCORE!! I went to yelp to see what was good to eat way ahead of this trip and always wanted to confirm that was still what i wanted when I looked around to see what people ordered. Now I don't remember word for word their dishes and I was starving so no photos either. Plus it was too dim so quality would have been poor. 1. Grilled octopus - wow, the lemon flavoring with a Mediterranean touch. Really really tasty yet light. I can eat this all day. Cooked to perfection2. string beans - more like crack beans - I don't know exactly what they used to cook this but I can tell you that I couldn't stop eating this since it landed on the table and it was actually a dish that nearly 90% of the restaurant ordered3. Pig face - don't ask, just order it and you will not regret this. I love the flavor and the crunch! Make it as messy as possible with the sunny side up egg. The messier the tastier. 4. Goat ribs - at first we were told that they ran out and we were so disappointed but the kitchen still had some. WOW. This was all of our favorite dishes. We never had goat ribs and it wasn't gamy at all. It fell right off the bones...omg I'm still dreaming about this. 5. Pork shank - I'm extremely disappointed how full we are were that we actually had a few bites of the shank left. We didn't do the pork shank justice because we didn't devour it like we did with other dishes but if it came out first, you betcha. I recommend that you mix the buttermilk ranch with the buffalo chick sauce and dip the shank...ah!! so delicious. My mouth is watering. So I know I came here yesterday but I'm already contemplating if I should go one more time this week because I leave Friday. Also, I told the waitress to tell her head chef to open a restaurant in NYC and the West village because it would be most suitable there. I love love this restaurant. My #1 favorite in all of Chicago. Hands down! Keep up the great work!!!"
"One of the great dining treasures along Randolph Street, I would highly recommend making reservations for this spot during your next trip to Chicago! Reservations are hard to come by but if you end up getting a less ideal time, I'd still recommend to make the effort to visit! The setting is very intimate but a bit loud - not a great date place but a great place to bring your friends and get your ""Pig Face"" on. Here are some brief comments regarding the dishes we had that night :)Bread - Pretzel with Smoked Salmon Spread (really delicious and light spread that complemented the saltiness of the pretzel bread well)Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (many different flavors onto one plate - I love the tamarind undertones and who can hate a sunny side egg to top it all off?)Wood Fired Scallops (DELICIOUS, my favorite dish of the night - comes with a smoked uni cream delicious asparagus and rhubarb bacon chimichurri - I loved the woody flavors and the slight caramelization on the scallops, truly delectable)Crisp Braised Pork Shank (FALL OFF THE BONE PORK, mmm mmm this came by the end of the meal and I was stuffed, but the bits I tried were really awesome, it came with this really great kimchi that cuts the fat a little bit with the sour - if that makes sense... the naan it came with was less than ideal, a little to thick and didn't complement the pork that well... the pork itself would have been sufficient :)) Great service as well, we did have to wait a bit even after making reservations but this place is a local favorite and worth the stop!"
"OH man. OH MAN! Two words: Pig. Face.The pig face is the best think you'll eat ever. EVER. Get two. Everything here is delicious. The cocktails are top notch. Every dish I've had here has been spot on. The staff is super friendly. They were more than accommodating with my food allergies. Right off the bat I was offered a menu that listed nut, fish and gluten allergens present in each dish. Their gluten-free bread is also amazing. Magical kiss in the moonlight with a perfectly timed shooting star that even comes with it's own chimes sounds, amazing. I'd recommend getting this to go, because it tastes just as good the next day, and you'll want to save room for all that pig face you're going to be noshing on. Secret: eat at the bar and you'll never need a reservation. Three out of my four visits here were done that way and I never had to wait more than 5 min before a seat opened up. FTW."
"I give this more stars than I personally would give it because I believe I am the wrong demographic for this place. If you are an adventurous carnivore and pig snout gets your digestive enzymes flowing, then this place is calling your name.I hear it takes months to get a reservation at this restaurant. I was in Chicago on business and 4 of us just walked in and were sat within 45 mins. My suggestion is just go! The cauliflower was delicious and the kohlrabi salad was so good that I reinvented the recipe at home. Kohlrabi is a unique vegetable and Girl & The Goat used it perfectly."
"Phenominal. Â Great to do as a group, because you can share many dishes. Â The service was unbelievable. Â They perfectly timed when our dishes would come out, and kept our drink glasses full. Â We were never too full because we ate in small portions and stayed for over two hours. Â What a creative and wonderful meal."
"Just wonderful! Â In Chicago on business with colleagues...two of whom had been recommended to try it. Â We were warned about long waits but wanted to try it anyway. Â On that front we really lucked out - walked in and they happened to have had a canceled reservation and offered it to us. Â 2 people and we ordered 4 dishes plus a bread dish off their menu. Â It was plenty of food. Â We had been to another small plates gem the night before with far smaller portions, so this was a pleasant surprise. Â Each dish was more delicious than the last. Â The service was great - they took our order and built the meal for us, specifically to let each dish shine by way of the order they were delivered. Â They were spaced out so we didn't get bored or hungry, and the table was never overly cluttered. Â Crispy short ribs...would eat every day. Â Open in NY, pretty please!!"
"Everything about my experience here was great. It's a fun restaurant with a great atmosphere. I went on a wed evening and it was packed! But why wouldn't it be? Their food is great!!! Everything I tried was delicious. It's all small plates so it can get pricy and you need atleast 2-3 plates per person. I had the pig face, grilled kalbi beef ribs, and wood grilled broccoli! Highly recommend this place!"
"I like to think of girl & the goat as chicago's version of state bird. They serve a lot of interesting dishes tapas style. Everything here is fried and heavy, but they all had a lot of interesting flavors. It was extremely hard to get reservations here, but probably not as hard as statebird in san francisco. We were able to get a table for 4 at 10pm on a week night. If you can, try to make a reservation early for this restaurant and explore all the interesting foods they have. They have an interesting take on beef tongue & duck tongue. I'm more use to the asian preparation. Never had it fried before."
"Worst experience ever. Â  All the dishes we order were extremely salty! Â The Baby octopus taste salty and had a rubbery texture. Â  The short ribs were burnt and not edible. Â  The only dish taste decent was the mussels and red beets. Â The scallops were ok. Â  Overall all the dishes had too much salt. Â  However, when I told the server about our experience he gave no explanation or consideration. Â  The total bill was $144 including tip."
"I don't think you can pick the wrong dish on the menu. This is how you should order food from their menu:1. Blindfold 2. Darts3. MenuThen throw the dart at the menu to pick what to eat- and enjoy. While I will admit I haven't sampled everything on their menu we did have:Roasted Beets - my father said he doesn't really like beets, but loved this dish, so it changed his mindWood Grilled Broccoli - BEST broccoli EVER!!Kona Kampachi Crudo - an elegant, flavor packed in a small package dish if I ever had oneDiver Scallops - cooked to perfectionWood Fired Walter's Chicken - wonderful glazedesert(s)-Sticky date cake - yum yum yumBittersweet chocolate - a flour-less cake I actually enjoyed (was skeptical before eating)Miso-butterscotch budino - pineapple and bacon toffee made this AMAZING!!If I had infinite money I would explore their menu more often, but for now it will be for only special occasions.PS. How can you not like their logo!?!! Too good all around."
"Believe the hype! Awesome flavor and texture, I was amazed at how creative the flavor and texture profiles were. Â I would fly back to Chicago just for this food. Still drooling over the cauliflower and goat belly dish. And the complimentary birthday dessert, I received, was divine. And by the way, I loved the music. Best birthday dinner ever :)"
"Since my last review, I've been back two more times, and think I've found my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I just love their menu and the staff are amazing!! Most recently, we stopped by after taste of Randolph and it was packed. We stood by the bar for 5 minutes and, perfectly, another party of three exited for their dining table, score for us!! We snagged the seats and sat down for drinks and a few shared plates. The bartender rocks! Their cocktails are amazing and when my friend mentioned the Paloma was a little sour for her tastes he remixed it for her and it was perfection. I had the pimms cocktail and the hubby stuck with old fashions. For food, we had the grilled oysters, which were amazing, the shisito peppers, goat carpaccio, and lamb stuffed octopus! Everything was on point and yummy! What I also really like is that they ask before the food order goes in, if there are any dietary restrictions. Love it!"
a bit overrated.. food is decent.. dont get what the hype is all about?
"I happened to have a meeting in the area and thought, why not. I was able to find a seat at the bat within 15 mins, it was a Thursday around 7 and you don't need a reservation for that. Â The waiter was very friendly and made some good suggestions. Everything I ordered was just too salty I had the green beans and the duck with kimchee. The duck was good but the Kimchee was just bad. I've never eaten anything so salty in my life, my tongue literally hurt by the end of the meal. Â I really wanted to like everything because I had built it up so much in my mind, but it just didn't work for me. Im not gonna lie I will go back with a group, just to be able to try different things."
Food is insanely good. You MUST save room for the dessert Miso Butterscotch Budino.There are NO words to describe.... OMG!
Was finally able to dine here with a reservation. Innovative dishes and good help. It is very crowded though.
"OK. I am a changed woman.I came to Girl & the Goat several years ago right after it opened. After waiting three months to dine here, my expectations were pretty high, and I left feeling rather let down. Our table sucked, the food was just okay and overall, I thought this place was a little over-hyped. But then I came back. We almost sat in the exact same table, but luckily, we were able to move to another table that had more room. This completely changed the entire experience and this ended up being one of the best meals I have ever had.In addition to several of their specialty cocktails we got:OystersGoat BellyPig Face (just do it -- you won't regret it)Halibut It's hard to explain, but damn, these flavor profiles just WORK. You can tell there is some true ingenuity behind each dish. I don't know if it was me or this restaurant that changed, but wow, I have definitely been converted and I definitely will be back!"
"does it live up to the hype? no. is it good? yes. been here 3 times now. first time was absolutely awesome. 2nd and 3rd times the food was exceptionally salty. cocktails were pretty weak, but tasty.ill go back if i have to, but you should go if you haven't."
You know what the best part of your dining experience at Girl and the Goat can be.. When you walk in the door and a seat at the bar opens right up! What a win. I was happy like a kid who just got candy.. And come on its justified! So many times I've given up on waiting cuz im starving and gone elsewhere. But moving forward I refuse to ever do that. So many Chicago trips have gone by and I hadn't been got g&tg out of sheer laziness and just like one my coworkers put it (Swastik I hope you're reading this) it really did feel like I was cheating on them!! So I decided to go big or go home and got the Goat Shank. The server mentioned that they have the rib instead.. I didn't see anything wrong with that. And there definitely wasn't. Yes it was a bit fatty.. But it's ribs goddamn it. Every piece just fell off the bones.. Oh the tender juicy goat.. Melting into a burst of flavour in your mouth. Sigh I'm in love. I'll be back sooner G&tG. Never cheating on you again. PS. This review is not just for this trip but at least 4 more and they were all perfect.
"Overall, I had an amazing experience at this restaurant. First, the food was presented extremely well. Not only that, but the food was cooked and seasoned perfectly! I'd say that we got a great deal for the price paid.Second, the service here is amazing. Our waitress was very knowledgeable of the menu. At one point, I didn't like one of the items we ordered, so she quickly recommended a different dish which she promptly brought out. On top of that, she didn't charge us for the dish we didn't like.Other things to mention would be the artwork. This place had some really weird art, but that's not a bad thing!"
"Girl & the Goat lived up to its amazing reputation. Â While it is a spendy restaurant, the food and drinks were worth every penny. Â We had a beer, cocktail, and shared about 5 plates. Â Our check was just under $100 before tip. Â I made reservations in September for mid-November. Â My only options, for a Thursday night, were 4:30 p.m. or 9:30 p.m. Â If you want a prime dining time, you are going to have to book really early. Â We were running very late and didn't arrive until after 5:00 p.m., but I called ahead to let them know and they said that our table was secure. Â We received outstanding service from the time I made the call until the moment we left for the evening.Our waitress made us feel very comfortable and welcome at Girl & the Goat. Â She even graciously took a photo of my husband & I (like total tourists, we are!), and she made some recommendations from the menu. Â Here are the dishes we tried:Goat Bleu Bread. Â A dense bread with robust blue cheese flavor, carmelized onions and I believe a bacon jam. Â I generally despite onions, but I could not get enough of this bread or the onions & jam.Pork Belly. Â The size of the dish was deceiving as it was the most ""artistic"" looking of the bunch. Â Our waitress recommended it when we told her that we like sushi. Â Every ingredient in all of the dishes are chosen intentionally and you could really taste it with the pork belly.Goat Empanadas. Â How do groups of more than two share these? Â These were my favorite dish. Â It's a good ""starter"" dish for anyone who is fussy about their food. Â Basically it is goat meat (which isn't at all gamey or weird) in an empanada crust.Pig Face. Â So crunchy, so flavorful! Â I will never look at a pig's face the same again. Â When served, it is not actually on the pig's head, so the faint of heart need not worry. Â It's just another part of the pig, and quite possibly the BEST part.Cauliflower. Â The best vegetable I've ever eaten. Â I believe it was made with parmesan, pine nuts, and some other stuff. Â The portion is huge and definitely enough for four people. Â The cauliflower had a surprising spiciness to it as well.There is a short list of cocktails and beers, including Three Floyds Gumballhead. Â Thanks to Ericka A.'s recommendation, I had the ""Best of Three"" cocktail which was light, refreshing, very slightly fruity and complimented my meal well.I would go back to Girl & the Goat in a heartbeat. Â Usually with spendy restaurants, I go once and check it off of my list, but this place is worth attending regularly. Â Three ladies at the table next to us (on a Thursday) were inquiring with the waitress about reservations on Sunday, only 3 days later!Amazing service and food. Â Definitely consider Girl & the Goat for a birthday, anniversary, or ""just because"" kind of night."
"You are always promised a good meal at G&TG. Can be more difficult for people who have a more limited palate, but I have always been able to find something to eat though I do not eat beef, pork or other meats where the animal walks on all fours. I'd go more often if it was not as difficult to get in."
"I'd give this place a NO star, but yelp doesn't give me that option...oh well. Good thing I didn't hear about this place until moments before I found out my boyfriend, his family, and I had reservations to dine there in celebration of his birthday; this is to say, I'm coming from an objective point of view and didn't have any expectations. We flew all the way from CA to try this place out; my boyfriend raved about this overrated restaurant and wanted to celebrate his birthday there. First of all, our seemingly inexperienced waitress, TAYLOR, encouraged us to order at least 2 plates per person as it's served tapas/family style. We were a party of five. Come time to order, we ordered a little more than 2/3 of the menu. That's about 3-4 plates per person!! You'd think she'd be pleased, afterall she is working for tips. Rather than being the obedient, do-what-we-say-waitress, Taylor judges our food choices, said we ordered too much, that we wouldn't be able to finish all the food and cited our choices were unbalanced. We caught ourselves explaining our choices as if we needed to explain them to her...WTF!!! Customers should never have to explain themselves and it's especially none of her business how much we eat!!! This ain't Jenny Craig!! Anyway, it got awkward for the whole table for the whole evening, and screwed up everyone's excitement for the restaurant. In addition, the food was just okay, or perhaps our waitress' attitude was so bad that it made our food taste mediocre. Personally, I'd rather go to a hole in the wall Mexican joint or a Korean bbq joint - the food would be just as good, the ambiance just as loud, however the service would be better...and that's not saying much! Â If it wasn't for the Sacramento Kings winning against the Pelicans that night, our evening would've been a botch! They have some marketing geniuses behind this joint because this Girl Goat restaurant certainly does not live up to its hype. The bill came out to $230. My party tipped her 15 percent which was generous as I lobbied for 8 percent!!!"
"Really hit and miss with the food! Â Service was great, but prices felt a bit high since not all the food was impressive.Let's start off from ""good"" to ""meh"" :Confit Goat Belly ($19): Bourbon Butter, Lobster, Crab, and Fennel. This was the highlight of the night! The goat belly was very flavorful and slightly salty, but the sweet lobster and crab pulled it all together. Â Recommended :)Goat Empanadas ($16): Marinated Sheep Feta, Picked Golden Beets, Tzatziki. This was one of the favorites of the night. It was a great blend of flavors, but the portion size was a little small considering the price.PB&J ($8): Salted Peanut Semifreddo, Concord Grape Granita, and Brioche Donuts. This was perfect! Love all the individual tastes...but combined, it's the perfect mix of sweet, salty, and tangy all at once. Â Yummy!Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face ($16): Sunny Side Egg, Tamarind, Cilantro, Red Wine Maple, and Potato Stix. This tasted like breakfast in each bite lol. Just like bacon, eggs, and hashbrowns. Â It was good, but I wouldn't order it again.Kona Kampachi Crudo ($16): Crisp Pork Belly, Chili Aioli, and Caperberries. This was ok..everything tasted good, but the combination wasn't perfectly orchestrated to me. Â I'd pass on this one.Escargot Ravioli ($13): Bacon and Tamarind-Miso Sauce. This was just ok...the sauce was a bit runny and didn't compliment the escargot in my opinion. Pass! Bittersweet Chocolate ($8): Shittake-Caramel Gelato and Toffee Creme Fraiche. Just like it sounds...bittersweet. It was a little more on the bitter end for me...I'd pass on this one too! So if you have better luck than me, you could have a better experience. Â But since not all the food was up to par in my book, I started thinking about the money being spent. Â Great food could merit the over $120+ tab...but this did not. Â Pics :"
"Surprisingly hip & a scene for such a well-regarded foodie restaurant. Â Reservations were a bit hard to get but if you check late the night before on Opentable, you may be able to snag a last-minute reservation.We loved the confit goat belly, the Vietnamese-inspired green beans, and the miso-butterscotch budino. Â The the pig face, wood fired oysters, and crudo were just okay. Several dishes were overly salty -- we wish we ordered bread. Service was surprisingly good for a restaurant with such a boozy young vibe; we'd definitely revisit to try more items, especially on the goat menu as we rarely get goat outside of specific ethnic restaurants.More details on my blog: Â pekoepeony.blogspot.com/â¦"
Full star! This place is legit from the first dish to dessert. I really liked their goat empanadas and escargot raviolis. The warm the sticky cake makes me so happy too
"Loved the menu and the service! The manager even took the time to mark up a menu with the chef to accommodate a food allergy of mine. The goat carpaccio was amazing! Drinks were tasty though ""Chicago"" priced - mine was $13 for basically an old fashioned. I want to go back for coffee and dessert. The only suggestion that I have is not to order as many dishes as they suggest - we had way too much food and spent a LOT of money. Most small plates restaurants let you order as you go - they did not seem keen on this idea. We ordered 5 plates for four people - plenty for us. (They recommended 8-9.) oh... And order the pigface! Outstanding!"
"Here's how you get a table at this place for 2....make a reservation at least a month in advance! Â It's really hard to get a quick reservation... but once you've made it, you're golden. Â Lucky for me and my bf, we got a reservation a week before, only because I was watching the reservation page like a hawk and I managed to squeeze us in at 4:45 on a Monday. Â But it was delicious!! Â We got:-apple smacks - ginger butter and apple sauce with nice warm bread. Â Since it was fall, this was a great appetizer that incorporates all that warm fall flavor. Â The bread even had pistachios in it!-the roasted cauliflower - it's more complex than it sounds!! Â There's so much in it! Â Pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint, cheese.. you'll love it. Â SO GOOD!-lamb ribs - its one of the larger plates that this restaurant offers and definitely one of my favorites. Â The lamb meat literally fell off the bone! Â It was nicely marinated and omg.. soo soo good.-wood oven roasted pig face - OMG... Â i know its a must to get a here and I had to try it.. but they're right.. it's a must try! Â It sounds weird.. but you don't really see the pig face.. it's more of a portion of it. Â It's very well done and the flavors are amazing. Â I was like.. where have you been all my life?If you're wondering why we got so many plates for 2 people, but this place is family style, so they don't really give you big portions. Â This was just enough for the 2 of us. Â We left feeling full and satisfied. Â I highly recommend this place.. DELICIOUS!"
"I know I know............. it doesn't make sense to review a place which has one of the longest waits for a weekend reservation.Just 2 words: Pork ShankYou'll thank me for this ;) and of course the chef.......hahhaPsst.........to skip the long waits, make a weekday reservation. & please don't thank me for giving away the secret...... :P"
"I cannot...repeat...cannot...say enough wonderful things about this fabulous find! Â My husband and I dined at the Girl & the Goat last night and it was the best meal we have ever had...ever. Â I know that sounds a bit dramatical, but it really was super impressive on every single level. Â Our server, Gary, was warm and funny and eager to point us in the right direction (as if there is a bad direction on this menu). Â The food and drinks were spectacular and the ambiance was perfect. Â GET: Â the hamachi crude, the chickpea fritter, the shishito peppers and the miso-butterscotch budino. Â Holy sh*t. Â We're going back on Friday."
"Tonight was my second time at G&G. Â The first time I went thought it was OK, but tonight confirmed that G&G is really not for me. Green Beans: Covered in a very sweet mayonnaise or ""aioli"". Â I didn't know if I was eating a veggie or a fry. Â Fried Peppers: under cooked and crunchy, covered with a sweetened breadcrumbs. Â Ravioli Escargot: Very good, well prepared. Â Light and not overly salted. Sashimi - Great presentation of mayonnaise with fish and pieces of bacon. Â :( Goat Belly Confit: Â crispy meat with lots butter and a sweet sauce soaked crabmeat. Â It was OK.Drinks: 1 Negroni and 1 specialty drink. Â Meh...Staff: Very good. Well trained and they know the menu inside and out. Â Bottom Line: Go there just to say you went"
"Went on a Saturday at 4:30pm without reservations. It would have been an hour to wait for the dining area or find an open spot at the lounge or bar area. We sat at the lounge just the two of us and it was nice. The sofas were comfy.Waitress and waiter we had weren't very friendly or smiley at first but warmed up to us as the meal progressed.Rice should have came with the food :) but that could be just the asian in me. Also every cooked dish was just a tad too salty.We orderedHouse blend juice: yum! Make sure to mix!Bread: there was a cheese bread that was deliciousRaw oysters: hubby enjoyed it. i don't like when it is even a little fishy and leaves fishy aftertaste which is what happened.Goat belly: very tender, one of the best entrees we orderedRoasted pork belly? a bit too crisp for my liking and not the best here. would rather eat it at an authentic chinese restaurant or over ramen at santouka.Grilled baby octopus: second favorite dish this evening. the octopus was cooked perfectly and not too chewy! yay! would be good with rice.Goat carpaccio: meat was good and tender. dressing on top was too sour for me. i think i am still more of a beef carpaccio fan.Roasted cauliflower: third favorite dish this evening. i could do without the sprinkled cheese? on top but still very good. and we got a lot! we saved it to eat with the cooked meat dishes we ordered. it would be good with rice too."
"I was SO excited to come here... and was finally able to snag a 8:15 PM spot on a Sunday evening. I had heard so many amazing things about this place. Two of my friends even told me it was the ""best meal they ever had"", so my expectations were really high. I ordered 5 dishes: -bread: it was the first dish that came out and surprisingly (and a bit sadly) may have been my favorite dish of the night. Although it was a bit oily, it was absolutely delicious and the two spreads that came with it were amazing as well. AND it was only $4!-goat belly: disappointing. I paid almost $20 for a tiny slab of meat which was good, but not THAT good... and the sauces were overly buttery. Did come with a few pieces of lobster/crab but it wasn't enough to make up for the mediocre nature of the dish.-green beans with fish sauce: sounds really plain, but my friend and the waitress ranted about it, so decided to give it a go. Definitely one of my favorite dishes of the night! The tangy sourness of the fish sauce was perfectly complemented by the more earthy flavors of the vegetables and cashews. A definite must get - portion was generous and it was only $9.-pig's face. So.... what's the big deal about this? I really don't get the hype... sadness. Pretty much some tender meat with some cilantro sauce and ""fancy"" french fries with a sunny side up egg all mashed together. This is their most popular dish?-diver scallops: I really liked this dish... only two scallops were given for the $17 I paid but they were decently big. I really enjoyed their twist on kimchi as well!Overall, I would give it 3.5 stars... Food was good, but definitely did not live up entirely to its hype."
"The Girl and The Goat started my husband and my 1 year wedding anniversary weekend and it was incredible! We could only get reservations for 10:15 pm and we made them two months prior to going, but it was well worth the late night meal. The waiter was knowledgable and told us exactly what the best items were on the menu after asking us about allergies and likes/ dislikes. The Goat Empanadas were out of this world as were the short ribs. My husband believed the short ribs to be ""ridiculous"" and the best he has ever had!It's a bit pricey, but again, worth it! The only complaint is that it is very loud and the menu is mostly tasting size dishes and they bring them out quickly to get you in and out. Other than that, incredible!"
Quite good. :) all the goat items are very creative! Get the Bodino for dessert. I also really enjoyed the braised beef.
Came on a weekday evening and sat at the bar. Atmosphere was great and food was delicious. We had vegetable and seafood dishes and everything were excellent. Cocktails were great as well!
"Truly enjoyed our experience. Â We walked in without a reservation and were seated at the bar. Â We received great, efficient service from a server, then when we moved over to make room for another couple, we transferred to the bartender Diana. Â She was able to be more personable & fun to watch shake a drink & stir another at the same time. Â Cocktails were a highlight. Â Food was fabulous, yet quite rich. Â Beef tongue & cheese course with lovely garnish were my faves."
"I have been waiting to try out Girl & The Goat for years, my plans to travel back to Chicago never seemed to allow me enough time to go so this time I made a point to get reservations way in advance, so I called over two months before my trip. I still ended up with a 4:30pm reservation on Friday, which was better than the only other option for 10:30pm on that Saturday! Anyway I was still really excited to try out the food as I have heard nothing but great things from friends and based on reviews.Our group of four showed up at around 4:25pm for our reservation, the lobby was already filled with people who had reservations and with those hoping to get in early enough to not have to wait long for a walk in table. We were seated within 10 minutes of arriving. Our server seemed nice but wasn't as helpful as I had hoped. Our group of four was split as far as our food preferences go; two of us a little more adventurous and the the other two a little more tame which makes it hard for us to all agree on plates. I explained our situation to our waiter as he suggested we all share plates and that we should order about two plates a person. We decided we would just break off into two groups and share with the other person with similar preferences.My fiance and I ordered the green beans, diver scallops, lamb ribs, and confit goat belly. I really was hoping that our waiter would let us know if were headed in the wrong direction or if he thought we would be going too one note, but he didn't.The green beans arrived, our friends also ordered them because we were afraid that there wouldn't be enough for four people based on what our server had told us. There were more than enough green beans to go around, I really enjoyed the complex flavors that were put into the sauce but after a few bites I was looking for something else to eat as well. After 5 minutes or so our next dish arrived, the scallops. The scallops were rich and I loved the pumpkin butter like sauce they were served in, the brussel sprouts and pomegranates were nice compliments to the dish as well. There were only two scallops so that dish went quickly, so I went back to the green beans for a little until the next dish arrived, the lamb ribs. The ribs were probably my favorite dish of the night as they were so rich, juicy, and moist. This was our third dish and we were starting to feel a little overwhelmed by the richness of each dish and they were starting to feel almost one noted because of the similarities on the richness scale. I really wanted to love my meal here and it would have been better if our server mentioned that all of our dishes were going to be really rich and maybe could have recommended a lighter dish to break them up. By the time our fourth plate arrived, I didn't even really want to eat it, I was full, but not full of food but just that rich flavor and eating goat belly wasn't going to be anything but more richness. I had to try it though since I wasn't going to be able to come back anytime soon. The goat belly was interesting and had a unique taste to it, the crab and lobster sides were good but I wasn't sure how they really complimented the dish so I was confused as to how I felt about ending our meal with it...Our friends ordered the green beans, the ham frites which seemed to be french fries with dried ham or a ham like powder on them, and the sugo which my friend described as a grown up version of chef boyardee which isn't necessarily a bad thing and I enjoyed the few bites I had of it.Overall I really did enjoy our food and our experience, next time I will ask about some of the lighter options though."
"There is nothing I could but amazing things about this restaurant. Now that I've had the food, I know why is so hard to get a reservation. Every part of the meal was amazing from the expert service provided by Kalee to the excellent food. Â 2 dishes stood out above all the ones we had. Â The pork shank and the goat empanadas are must have dishes.The creative desert also put a capper on a great night. Â It was so go I can't wait to good again."
"Overall a very good experience! I had a party of 4, so we were able to split about 8 dishes. We each got about 2 spoons of each dish, but it was enough and made it more like a tasting menu. The prices are totally reasonable for the quality of their food. I was impressed with every dish and was not disappointed. By the way, they sell their sauces to-go, so don't forget to inquire about them! The only negative thing is that it is very difficult to get a reservation here. I went on a Tuesday night and it was still hard to get a reservation for a table of 4 at a reasonable time. I kept checking OpenTable everyday and eventually a 7:45pm slot opened up, so we lucked out. Next time I'm in Chicago, I would definitely come back!"
"All that can be said about food has been said, so my friends and I have only two words to say--sexy bathrooms. (As in if you totally hit it off with your date, you could steal away for a quick make out session in one of the dimly-lit spacious bathrooms in the hall downstairs.)"
"The cocktails were strong. Â The service was good. Â The chickpea fritters were excellent as were the short ribs. Â But then. Â I love grilled octopus but this dish had just too much going on without focus or great flavor. Â The mussels were large but stringy and overwhelmed by the accouterments. Â We arrived early (5:15 reservation). Â By the time we left (about 7) we couldn't hear each other - it was just too loud.In general an ok place, but not one I'd rush back to."
"It took 3 months to get a reservation. Â That says something.Quality chow. Â A lively (noisy) environment. Â Casual, in a nice way. Â Small plates, and they come fast.Almost everything comes with a dipping sauce. Â Big points for that. Â And a decent beer list.2 people, 6 plates, 1 beer, dessert and coffees: $130 total. Â Not bad for a place in such high demand."
"We are vegetarians... So I will only be mentioning vegetarian food that we tried..There were a lots of vegetarian options! Â They did mention they also had a vegan menu as well. Â We tried the following: Honey Sambar Brioche Bread Roasted CauliflowerPan Fried Shishito PeppersChickpea FrittersFresh juice CocktailOut of those Roasted Cauliflowers were our favorite. Â I didn't know you can actually make cauliflowers taste that great! The portion for this plate was also large. Â I highly recommend it. Honey Sambar Brioche Bread was also really good! The flavor was sweet with a little spice to it. The chickpea fritters were also also nice. Â A lot of people we know love the Pan Fried Shishito Peppers, so we had ordered them. However, we thought they were okay. Â We had couple really spicy ones comes so it was hard to eat more, but we were told that usually doesn't happen. They also took them off our bill which was very nice of them. There are also lots of peppers in one plate, so it was hard for 2 of us to finish them. Â Also, if you are looking for a virgin drink, they do have a very nice fresh juice cocktail. Â Overall, the service was great and food was excellent. Â I would definitely go back! The only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because we had asked for a table by the windows, Â but they said no even though there were many open."
"Great food that is perfect for sharing with another person. Â  You can fill up pretty quickly because the portions are reasonably sized to share with another person or two. Â You must try the Pig Face! Â It sounds strange but it is probably the best thing on the menu. Â  Their desserts are also pretty amazing so don't leave with out having one. Â  I would suggest making a reservation pretty far in advance, otherwise, it might be tricky to get a time that is in between 6:00 pm - 8:30 pm, the most popular time to eat dinner."
This place was one of the best places I've been in a really long time. All the dishes we ordered were small dishes that would be best ordered and shares by two people. We started out the meal with the kohlrabi salad. The server told us the salad was not ordered often and that is was a shame. The salad was as exceptional as he has said. I would suggest it to anyone. Our second order was the smokes goat rilette empanadas. Â They we're absolutely fantastic. Next was the hanger streak. It was cooked fantastic and was extremely tender. Per the servers instructions the roasted cauliflower was then served. Loves it and the portion was huge. Lastly we got the roasted pig face. It was really good but pretty fatty. The atmosphere was fantastic and the service was excellent. I would recommend this plane to anyone in Chicago looking for a really good night.
"My mom made reservations two weeks in advance to get a dinner spot at 7pm. Street parking was not too bad. When we entered the restaurant, every table was booked including the bar areaWe sat at our two table spot and checked out the menu. The menu is divided into veggies, meat, and fish? You'll see. Everything is tapas style, then again some courses are a lot bigger than others. My mom kept asking me what's good here, I told her, because the reviews are amazing, anything is good, let's pick not what everyone else eats, but what we are interested in eating. So we did that, we ordered the miso bread, how can the bread taste that good, the goat pate, how can the biscuit be so light and buttery, the blueberry jam that came with it was gone in seconds. The Soft shell crab w/ elotes was unreal and so was the beef ribs with corn. Seriously, anything you order will make you smile :) Stop reading this review and go eat this place."
menu was a bit too eclectic for a business dinner.
"LOVED LOVED LOVED this place. Perfect for shared plates. Everything was perfectly seasoned. The goat spine was fabulous. The servers were all professional and friendly. I HATED HATED HATED the noise. We were a table of four and were hoarse by the end of the evening trying to talk. I would say to come to this place as a couple because it would be easier to talk but then you would have less plates for sharing. May I suggest, like on some commuter trains how they have a cell phone free car, a music free night. They were playing terrible music in this place. I don't understand why they play music in a restaurant when it's already too loud to talk. Talk? People were yelling at one another. The food was wonderful though."
great food - nice to sit in the bar area
"When we came in to ask for a table of 3 the host asked us if we would be done by 6:30 because there's a party coming later and they might need the table. I was with a party of 3 and they sat us down at such a small table we all could barley fit. I asked the waiter if I could put two tables together and said no. The table was so small for 3 people our feet were awkwardly touching eachothers feet and my foot wasCrammed sideways under table. Getting in and out of the table was a struggle because everytime I got up I was bumping the people next to me and I watched their table shake cause the tables were so close! Almost like if I was eating dinner to the people next to us! I felt rushed from the beginning when the host asked us ""how long you think you'll be here, because we have a party coming at 6:30""BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE! And seating 3 adults on a small table that barley fits two is ridiculous!! On top of that the waiter recommended 6-8 plates for us...how the hell will we fit all that on our table! The table was crowded! We knocked over things and got my $500 sports coat dirty with all the reaching and knocking over things! Did I mention CROWDED table not only with the food but with me and two other guests figuring out where to put our drinks and food. It was more work figuring out where to place everything and didn't truly get to enjoy the food more time organizing the table around!First and last time I'll be going there, foodWas OK and pricey for what you get."
"If you are looking for an amazing place for tapas style food this is where to go. Its a lot of fun to eat your way through the menu. My favorite was the goat empanadas, Â i never had goat before and this was such a great first experience! Our waiter was super attentive and extremely friendly and genuine. We were sat in the corner booth area and it was perfect because in a relatively tight restaurant we had space as well as the ability to look at what everyone was getting. I can't wait to go back!!"
"Best restaurant experience ever. Sat at the kitchen seats. Loved environment,chefs,food, and waiter. No wonder reservations are hard to get"
"Amazing food and staff. We were seated at the Chef's table for my husband's birthday. It was a unique experience that we won't forget. The cauliflower, octopus, pig face and goat confit were delicious. Every dish is fresh and balanced and savory. We ended with the butterscotch dessert. We will be back."
"My friend's friend couldn't make her reservation, and because she didn't want to cancel it, she gave it to my friend who invited me with a few others (five total).The only thing that impressed us was the pig's head. Other than that, everything was just blah. The peppers were delicious, and I think out of the fifteen I ate, only 2 had a spicy kick. They had a delicate balance of oil, freshness, sweetness, and crunchiness. Service was great and attentive!As for food, I'm not sure if I would come back for it. It doesn't fit my palate (it didn't match the hype or the food). I like the small-plating idea, but I think our group of five should have ordered more of each dish because we could only manage one bite of each.(We went last year.)"
"I was visiting Chicago from NYC and gotten a rec from a friend about the Top Chef legacy restaurant, girl and a goat.Oh. My. God. So we decided to actually come here last minute, and on valentines day, so we knew for sure the place would be booked. My bf and I arrived right as it opened at 430 hoping we could maybe get a seat at the bar. Luckily they said that they were taking first come first serve walk ins as long as we give the table back before the 6pm reservations started (that was the earliest options for reserving).The restaurant itself was so cute, which I can best describe as fancy vintage barn style, and much larger than I had imagined (though I have gotten used to the ny hole in the walls). The couple tables are placed kind of close together but nothing unbearable. The service was impeccable with the staff having various professional uniforms distinguishing different types of wait staff even. All were super polite and charming.The food. Ohhhh the food. We settled on what seemed like classics according to the yelp reviewers and got the chickpea fritters, pig face, and goat belly. The waiter helped us choose our last dish which turned out to be my boyfriends fave, the trout. The trout came first, cooked on the rarer side, to perfection. The hit home was the sauce which seemed to have a tomato base and rosemary, a new flavor that was bursting and indescribable. Second dish that came out with the goat belly, with lobster and crab. The portion was pretty small, especially since I was sharing with another person, but mostly because I loved it so much I wanted to keep eating it for days. The belly was supremely tender and fatty and paired wth the lobster/crab was the unexpected butterscotch base sauce. Holy mother of goats, it's like an explosion that melts in your mouth. The pig face was next, and was a more standard taste to me. The actual meat was delicious and tender. We were told to break the egg and eat it like a breakfast hash type deal, and it was definitely savory yet I wouldn't say it tasted like a delicacy like the first two dishes. Finally the chickpea fritters which had also been highly raved about. It didn't really meet my expectations. Don't get me wrong, it was definitely an interesting dish, but after the previous dishes, it didn't really compare. Tasted like an exotic salad of Indian/Greek fusion inspiration with emphasis on exploring food textures rather than taste. We had plenty of room for desert since we didn't choose too many of the main dishes (they recommend for two people to get 4-5). We couldn't decide between the plantain cake (seemed to be missing from the yelp menu) or the butterscotch desert, but the waiter said to hands down get the plantain cake. This dish is more for people who like tart flavors, as it had a strong passion fruit cream sauce paired with the plantain cake. The waiter was extremely generous to also give us a small comp'd sample of the butterscotch pudding. My taste favored the butterscotch in all it's creamy buttery bitsofcrunchy goodness so I would recommend it more, but really both deserts were unique and well worth trying.This is seriously one of the best meals I've ever had, and compared to ny prices, it didn't seem to be too bad for what we took from it. It can only be described as a foodie's magical journey, a dream wrapped in a wish, kissed by a juicy goat. It has changed my yelp ratings game now that I truly know what five star can actually mean. Well done, top chef, well done."
"It obviously takes weeks and weeks to get a table at this place, but luckily I had reserved a spot on Open Table a couple months back. It was packed as usual even on Â a Monday night at 9 pm, but the service was great and we were immediately seated at our reserved time.The food was seriously delicious. We ordered close to 10 plates between the 4 of us, and there wasn't a bad dish among the lot. The highlights for me included the escargot ravioli, the smoked chicken, and the delightful scallops. The roasted cauliflower was also a surprisingly complex and delicious dish despite cauliflower being so easily boring in its natural form.Definitely check them out if you have the chance. The price is also completely reasonable for the product. Yummmmmm!"
"I'm not going to lie: we came here because my husband and I are huge Top Chef fans. And I was nervous after getting seated at a super-small, super-cramped table that they actually have to pull out to let one person sit down (I'm guessing this is a Chicago thing, because we've seen it more than once this trip). But our waitress was warm and friendly, my water glass was never empty, and nobody gave me grief when I only had one glass of wine.The plates are offered in categories, so we just decided to pick one from each. We started off with the pretzel bread and smoked salmon cream, which was OMG good. There's nothing like fresh-baked bread, is there? And there was nothing fishy about the salmon cream - it was just rich and lovely.Next up were the wood-grilled oysters, which were cooked perfectly. I've only just discovered that I loved oysters (after a trip to NOLA) - they were buttery soft and just super tasty. The chickpea fritters were different from expected, but not in a bad way - they just melted in your mouth. Our goat empanadas had a light, crisp exterior and were everything good in the world. We got adventurous with our proteins, opting for the braised beef tongue (my husband's a fan of tongue; I'd never tried it before but am SO GLAD I did) and the fried frog's legs (he was terrified, but we're both converts). It was all so so so tasty.Of course, we couldn't leave without dessert. We went with the rhubarb shortcake and plantain cake. There was something a little disconcerting about the latter, but again - not in a bad way. There was just a bit of bitterness to offset the sweet, and I decided after eating most of it that I liked it (took me a while - it was just a really complex dessert!). The rhubarb was awesome, too, all kinds of sweet and tart and crisp.As a little bonus: right before dessert, I watched Rob Reiner walk into the restaurant. Totally thought I was hallucinating or making things up, but no, the waitress came by after seeing my shocked face and said, ""You saw him, right?"" Apparently he comes there regularly. No one sitting near us seemed to recognize him by face, but hello, this is Mr. ""When Harry Met Sally"" and ""Princess Bride."" (I died a little. Seriously.)The check was way less than I had anticipated, which was another nice bonus. My husband joked that G&tG did restaurant-ing the way Tyra Banks does modeling: H-to-T. Everything about the place was wonderful - the decor, the staff, the food. Even the bathrooms were perfect. Oh, and did I mention the music? When the Eels ""Fresh Feeling"" came on, I knew I was home (it was the song I walked down the aisle to at our wedding).I vow to return to this restaurant every single time I'm in Chicago. Seriously, I loved it that much."
"We had a party of 7 for a Saturday evening meal and everything could not have been more perfect. The servers were attentive and quick to bring out fresh plates after each course we ordered. The uniqueness of each dish contributed to overall excellence. The real winners of the night were the marinated beef tongue, duck liver mousse, and yellow fin tuna crudo. We had a chance to try nearly everything on the menu and nothing disappointed. I highly recommend for anybody looking to be adventurous and exciting meal. The ambience and noise doesn't lend much for a romantic evening, but it's great for group meals."
"Our group of 4 ordered 2 orders of bread and 8 plates of food. Every dish was better than the last and came out in an order that seemed to build on top of the last. I'd have to assume this is planned to complement the food as well as the experience. The stand-out dish was the pork shank which was probably the best pork I had ever had in my life (no, that isn't hyperbole in the slightest). Our waitress was fantastic and the food runners did a good job explaining the dishes and answering questions as it came out. A great experience to which we will return whenever we are in Chicago."
Fantastic. Really great drinks and apps! Can't wait to head there for dinner in the near future.
"Just yum. Totally worth the three month wait where we could still only get in at 9.15 on a Sunday. Â Seing as there are already 2100+ reviews, I won't ramble on...The beverages are great. The food is excellent. The service is excellent. Just go already."
"I'll keep this one short and to the point. Â Does not live up to the hype. Â Place is good not great. Â Service was good and atmosphere was pleasant but none of the dishes we had really made us say ""Wow""."
i had one of the most amazing dinners here at girl and the goat! i was seriously so lucky to experience this amazing culinary experience. my friends and i were visiting but didn't have reservations and we just decided to walk in late at night around 10pm hoping to maybe grab a seat at the bar but they ended up having a table for us! what we ordered (and loved!)-crispy pork shank with kimchi puree and pickled peaches (this dish was amazing! my favorite dish of the night. it was perfectly crispy on the outside with just a thin thin layer of skin and tender and juicy on the inside. the pickled peaches was an amazing touch and added an balance of flavor to the meat)-crispy pig face with sunny side up egg (wow!)-green beans (seriously took green beans to a whole new level)-diver scallops-hamachi tartare-bread (very delightful corn relish as spread)the kitchen is open so you can see the magic in the back. i highly recommend going here if you're visiting chicago. they also have a full bar and serve up delicious drinks as well.
"Not a surprise that this places is well deserving of the 5-stars I'm giving it. Girl & The Goat easily has an incredible take on fusions and creativity on their dishes. Not too many places offer the diversity and risky ingredients like pig face on their menu. As a foodie, I welcome these risks.The G&G really lives up to its hype and experiencing it firsthand you'll understand. The environment really lends itself to a family style setting which is influenced in their portions. So best come hungry and with a horde of people to taste everything. Â I recommend three dishes: Escargot Ravioli, Goat Belly with Lobster and Crab Meat, and Oven Roasted Pig Face. The escargot ravioli will nail you with an experience that you haven't had ravioli before. I mean a miso tamarind broth? What the shit?! That's French-Italian-Japanese fusion dish right there. Its got that good good. I won't even describe the other dishes because it's really pointless to write how amazing this shit is."
Phenomenal. Every time. Food. Service. The bomb dig.
"One of my top five dining experiences, ever. We were happily seated at the chef's table, which is a two top bar seat right up against the sautÃ©e station. I have no idea if the menu changes seasonally, but we had sourdough bread, shishito peppers, frog legs, duck tongue, goat belly, cheese... Not to mention drinks and coffee. Service was great.An absolute testament to how awesome this place is: we made Saturday night reservations at 11pm and the place was still packed when we got in there. It's expensive, yes. For the two of us it was roughly $200 (including tip). Worth it."
"I can't believe that I haven't yet reviewed this restaurant, despite having been there about 5-6 times. After our latest visit this past weekend, I just had to write about it. In the past, our experience was hit or miss in terms of dishes (2-3 would be good 2-3 would be just ok). Service has always been great. We started out with one of the breads, which was very good (although a larger portion would have been appreciated). We then got the crispy beef short ribs, which may now be one of my favorite dishes of all time. We serious considered getting another order--that's how good it was. The roasted cauliflower, our usual standby, was excellent, as were the shishito peppers (but mostly because of the cheesy sauce). Â The only real miss of the night was the grilled marinated pork belly. I was expecting something like bacon, as usual, but what we got was a tough, almost skirt-steak like dish that lacked the usual pork belly flavor. That aside, we are already plotting our next trip."
"I was blown away by Girl & The Goat on my first visit last year but this time, not so much. Â The place is still packed and you still have to stalk OpenTable to get a reservation but instead of being this new place where locals hang out, it seems like it's become the place for tourists who think they know the ""secret"" restaurants that only locals go to.My biggest complaint is that the menu hasn't changed in over a year. Â In fact, when the waitress asked us if we had been here before and told her it had been over a year, she said ""Oh good. So you're familiar with the menu"". That was a bad sign. You have a restaurant that is supposedly run by an award winning chef who is always on the lookout for new dishes and your menu hasn't changed in over a year? Not good. The pork shank was still incredible but everything else was average and boring. Duck tongue tasted like some sort of fried meat but was way too acidic. They proved once again that seafood is not their strong point with the ahi tuna. While the tuna was decent, the mushrooms ruined the dish. Bread was boring and desserts were sub-par. Your ""newness"" has worn off, Girl & Goat. So many other places are doing what you're doing now but instead of changing and keeping ahead of everybody, you've decided to settle for ""middle of the road""."
"A close friend of one of my classmates was in town, and we wanted to take him somewhere special in Chicago for the night. We didn't have any reservations in advance, and called a few places. (Somehow) Girl and the Goat had space left for a same-night reservation that Monday! I've heard that people have had to get reservations months in advance so I guess we just got super lucky.I immediately liked the rustic/country feel of the restaurant, and I was impressed with the good service. Our waitress told us that for four people, we should order between 8 and 10 dishes. However, being poor med students and not too terribly hungry, we decided on 6 - two appetizers and one dish selected by each of us. This turned out to be the right amount. We followed the style of sharing the dishes family style, but some of them were seemed hard to share just given their structure. We tried:1. Crisp Braised Pork Shank2. Wood Fired Walter's Chicken3. Seared Tuna4. Spring Onion Pot Stickers5. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face6. Ham FritesWe tried to decide on a favorite dish but couldn't really agree because they were all so delicious. If I had to choose a personal favorite, it would have to be the Pork Shank. The meat was so tender that it melted in my mouth, and the bread that came with the dish was just astounding.I would have liked to rate them four and a half stars, but decided to round up to five rather than round down. Although the food was delicious, I wasn't really surprised by anything I tried. It was about what I expected it to taste like. All in all though, Girl and the Goat is a must-try for any Chicago resident. Just be sure to make reservations a loonnggg time in advance!"
"When you leave Girl & the Goat saying, ""That cauliflower was ridiculously awesome!"" you know their food is good! Â Yes, cauliflower. Â You've eaten cauliflower and other foods on their menu all your life but you will rave about the unique and delicious flavors they combine to make it the best you've ever had. Â I'm not saying that you must go there and get the cauliflower, I'm saying that anything you order here will be a memorable experience making you HAVE to make your reservations to return as you leave the restaurant. Â  Speaking of reservations, schedule ahead ladies and gents! Â It's like scheduling your dentist appointments- 6 months out or their best dinner times will be taken and you'll have to go at 4:00pm and sit at the bar or lounge area when they open (and yes, I have done this)."
"Let me start off: I made reservations in January for myself and 4 friends for a 6:45 dinner on a week night. Two months later we were FINALLY able to enjoy great food and drinks. We were seated in a cozy round table right next to the door overlooking the street. I was a bit apprehensive at first as I thought it would be chilly but of course Girl and the Goat did not disappoint we were cozy the entire meal.Our waitress encouraged us to order 10-12 dishes to share...we ended up ordering 10 with each of us picking too. My favorite hands down: ham frites, escargot ravioli and the crisp braised pork shank. All the dishes were full of flavor and unique. Then were dessert we ordered 3 dishes. I loved the bittersweet chocolate dessert.We even saw Stephanie Izard in the back making sure everything was running smooth...very cool to see the action live! Even though the bill was definitely on the pricier side I think a splurge once in a while is definitely worth it. I will be back this summer to try even more amazing dishes."
Most unique . Great wait staff. Matt was best. Lucked out with end bar seat. Â Be ready for different and unusual.Be adventersom.
"As a foodie who has travelled and tasted some of the best foods in the states - from San Diego, Los Angeles, San Francisco, DC, Boston, New York City, and even St Louis... And still has only just started w her food adventures, almost every dish here was extremely underwhelming and bottom line disappointing. Every bite left your mouth either salty or w a layer of grease...For one of the most highly rated places in Chicago w the most reviews, the food was not up to par and did not even come close. We tried all of the most raved about dishes - the goat belly w lobster chunks & vanilla bourbon sauce - the highest recommended dish by our waitress, roasted cauliflower, sea bass, pig face, broccoli w blue cheese and rice crispies. My company and I did not enjoy anything here, even after a couple of drinks. We are glad to have at least tried this place to satisfy our curiosity but that is the only thing we will leave satisfied with today. I will definitely not be coming back."
"Yum. Â We had reservations for 11:30pm, but decided to chance it and arrive three hours early. Â Voila! Â A spot opens in the lounge. Â We lunge. Â Seats secured. Â I will say That my experience here ranks high, with all three criteria hitting the mark: Â Service, decor, and FOOD/WINE. Â Diver scallops with fried brussel sprouts was the standout, and of course the goat belly. Â  This is not to say that the other dishes weren't completely awesome. Â But I have a sweet spot for seafood and bellies. Â I've had many iterations of goat, and almost all of its ""parts,"" usually in Oaxaca or the Navajo Nation. Â So my dining companion and I were pleasantly astounded by what Chef Izard did with it. Â Try it. Â It's been described here numerous times so I won't bore you...The cauliflower was spicy browned perfection. Â The green beans/roasted beets had a hint of anchovy swimming in the avocado creme. Â Perfect. Â Would get them again. Â And here's the clincher: Â I usually don't like desserts, especially non-chocolate ones. Â But my companion and I had a disagreement, she won, and we got the butterscotch budino. Â OMG LIKE OMG LIKE OMG. Â (ok, enough of my inner twink). Â It was absolutely stunning. Â I have dreamt about it since. Â  Service was excellent, friendly, and attentive without being formal or overbearing. Â Interior space is nice. Â I would opt for the lounge again.OK, while I may be a some-time foodie, I had no idea Chef Izard was a Hollywood star...despite this, her food was awesome."
"Lately, I've had to go to Chicago for work rather often. I have absolutely 0 complaints about it. I love food and Chicago is a town that is known for food. So this time around, my boss said that we had to go to Girl and the Goat. Obviously, I've wanted to go for some time, but have never had a chance. She went to make a reservation (3 weeks out) only to find that the only available time was 10 PM. So we decided to take our chanced and brave the bar.The clock struck 5:00 and we bolted for the train and speed-walked to the restaurant. We arrived and there were 2 seats left at the bar (note the entire lounge area was open at this point, but I'd take a bar seat over a couch to eat on any day). We ordered a couple drinks and dove into the menu. The final score was1. Shishito Peppers - The sesame/miso crust was amazing. I could eat those things every day.2. The Green Beans - Again, amazing, though they did get a little bit salty after a bit and the portion on them was huge. She ended up taking the remaining home (jealous).3. The Hamachi - YUM. I think this may be over looked a lot, but it was amazing. It was so light and balanced, and necessary in a meal that was otherwise pretty heavy.4. The Seared Scallops in the Uni Cream with bacon and rhubarb - This may have been my favorite dish of the night, to be fair though, I'm a scallop junkie and LOVE uni, the 2 together with bacon? Absolutely dreamy for me.5. The Ham Frites - We were on the fence about this one, but we did it. And no regrets! When you are at a restaurant like this - go big or go home! The fries were nice and crunchy and the sauces were great. The ham dusting on top gave them just enough flavor without being too much (which I think is a problem with ""fancy"" fries these days)6. The Pig Face - because DUH, how can you go somewhere and see Pig Face on the menu and NOT order it? It ends up being really just the pork cheeks, but it is so melty and rich with the fat making the meat sooo soft. The potato sticks give it a little crunch and the each adds just a little bit more richness.At the end, we were too full to order dessert, but the meal was a full blown foodgasm. Totally amazing. Had there been a wait, would have been worth it!"
"I've been wanting to go to Girl & the Goat since it opened. Â I made reservations in September for January 5. Â Mine and the BF's anniversary is January 7, so, the timing was perfect. Â I could've made reservations sooner, but wanted this meal to be something special. Â He totally got into it also, which was awesome.We arrived at around 8:15 for our 8:45 reservation. Â While we were waiting for a cabbie to move from the valet spot, Stephanie Izard walked out the front door of G&G, assumingly to head to Little Goat, which just opened across the street. Â So, what does my boyfriend do? Â Rolls down my window and calls her over. Â He introduces himself and then me. Â She was super friendly and nice, thanked us for coming, and wished us a Happy New Year. Â How cool was that?We checked in at the host stand and stood by the bar and had a drink while we waited for our table. Â A group of ladies was getting up from the bar and offered us their seats, (which other patrons around saw) and as we thanked them, the couple who had been standing next to us swooped in, gave me the stink eye, and stole the seats. Â Whatever, if you want to prove you have no class, go right on ahead. Â If it's that important for you to sit, sit. We were seated earlier than our reservation time (which is always appreciated.) Â Our server attended to us promptly, making suggestions on how to order, and explaining how the menu worked. Â We ordered oysters right away, and sat to peruse the rest of the menu and decide.The oysters came up quickly, and we ordered the rest of our meal, after taking into account the servers suggestions, and the fact that I'd been not-so secretly studying the menu online for weeks. Â We ate:wood fired wiley point oysters: horseradish. bacon. preserved lemon. Â Still raw (which I wasn't expecting) but amazingly delicious. Â The bacon had the perfect amount of crunch and salt, the horseradish and lemon were creamy.roasted beets: green beans. white anchovy. avocado crÃ¨me fraiche. bread crumb. Toss up for my favorite dish. Â The flavors and textures were perfect. Â The table next to us was debating ordering them, because ""anchovies are scary"" (I disagree.) I assured them that there is no anchovy taste.steamed west coast mussels: perilla. winter squash. garlic crunch. Â Perfectly cooked, paired well with the ham frites, which the server had suggested.ham frites: smoked tomato aioli. cheddar beer sauce. Â Honestly, we ordered these by accident. Â The server had suggested pairing ""the fries"" with the mussels, I thought that ""fries"" since I hadn't seen them on the menu, were just an add-on with the mussels, not the ham frites that were on the menu. Â They were delicious, and I'm glad we got them, but by the menu description, I wouldn't have ordered them, because I thought it was *ham* and not *frites.*diver scallops: Â xo. pork sausage. shiitake. bok choy. butternut squash. Â Again, toss-up on my favorite dish. Â The scallops were HUGE. Â I'm talking, I got 5 bites out of one scallop. Â They come 2 to an order, so if you're going with more than one other person, plan accordingly. Â Perfectly seared, flavors, again, spot on. Â Melt-in-your-mouth delicious.mushroom ragout: sweet potato agnolotti. shroom crÃ¨me fraiche. capers. Â Bummer, we didn't like this one. Â The BF battled through and ate the mushrooms out of it, but the agnolotti was mushy and there was a spice throughout that I can't place that neither of us cared for. Â womp womp.wood oven roasted pig face: sunny side egg. tamarind. cilantro. red wine-maple potato stix. Â This was the one thing I said I HAD TO try. Â Even after I saw the video on how it's made on seriouseats.com and that it includes tongue... I had to try it. Â It was SO RICH. Â Perfect to have as the last course of the meal, but I almost couldn't eat more than two bites because I was already getting full!Things that were excellent: Â Service. Â Attentive, but not overbearing. Â Water constantly refilled, drinks offered, check-ins at the appropriate times.99% of the food.Ambience. Â I like the layout and dÃ©cor of the restaurant.Things that were still good, but not amazing:There was a little bit of lag between some of the courses. Â I enjoyed not feeling rushed, I knew we were welcome to stay as long as we wanted, but it seemed that between the mussels and scallops there was a lot of down time. Â We munched on the frites in the meantime, but I think that led to part of my full-ness of not being able to fully enjoy the pig face, and we had zero room for dessert.I agree with others that the music was just [thismuch] too loud.All in all, a stellar experience, and I CANNOT WAIT to go back, and neither can the BF. Â The price was more reasonable than I was expecting, and I can totally justify several return visits!Personal note to Stephanie Izard - I hope you got a kick out of the guy and girl in the white escape on Saturday night waiting for valet, and didn't think we were creepy!"
"By some stroke of luck, a group of 6 of us were able to find a reservation the day prior. Â Our waitress was very helpful and helped us navigate through the large menu and the variety of palates in the crew. Â Being a vegetarian and a self-proclaimed foodie can be a curse especially when you go to a restaurant with a menu of goat-related items. Â However, this place had more than enough vegetarian-friendly items that were thoughtfully made and full of flavor. Â In fact, of all of the items, the vegetarian items were devoured first. Â Do not forget to try to broccoli!! Â The meats looked amazing as well. Â My group ordered the pork shank and pig face as well as a few other items. Â I mention the pork since if I were to ever break this childhood tradition of vegetarianism, it would have to be pork...especially if it looked like what they served here!Lastly, do not forget to try their cocktails. Â Channeling my inner mad man, I had 2 (err, maybe 3) old fashioneds. Â They were fantastic."
"Expensive , and the food is not my style. Would not try again."
"I've heard a lot about this place and wondered just how much of it was hype above substance. I tend to avoid overly-exclusive places because I just don't care to plan my dinners months in advance. A lot of things can change in that amount of time... as was evidenced by the conditions under which I did eventually go: someone made reservations for four, only to eventually be unable for any of them to go, so the reservations were handed off to my date, who invited me along with her friend.The seating situation is a bit unimpressive for a place considered to be so desirable -- we were seated at a large table with two other groups of people, and found nothing about our experience to be at all intimate. However, that is really where my complaints stop -- everything else about the experience was pretty damn good.We tried grilled baby octopus, escargot ravioli, duck tongues, roasted cauliflower, and confit goat belly, and all of it was impressive. The amount of flavor packed into everything was quite unexpected. Would I make reservations and then spend months anxiously waiting to use them? No. But I might consider making reservations repeatedly just to afford myself the luxury of deciding whether or not to actually use them when the time comes around.Not much for ambiance, and a bit awkward getting seated, but this place certainly won't disappoint your taste buds."
"The best meal I have had in a long time! Â I went to Chicago for a long weekend from Louisville Ky. Â I will be coming back soon to dine again at the Girl & the Goat. Â The duck tongue was amazing! Â I thought the food, price, and ambiance were all on point. Â The pig face dish was delish too. Â Don't skip on dessert! Â It is a must! Â Love this place!"
"Can I write a 5-star review because of a salad? I don't care, cause that's what I'm going to do. The kohlrabi salad rocks my world - seriously, I could eat it every single day. Oh my gosh, and the bread. So good. I could live on bread and salad and if I did, it would be the bread and salad here."
"Coming to Chicago I was told that this was a must...restaurant to go to. I finally was able to get a reservation. Ummm....Great vibe and cool atmosphere. The service and presentation was great, the food was above average but not great. In a city, such as Chicago where you can get amazing food at every price point, I feel I overpaid for tapa style, above average food .Would I go back again, sure if someone who had not been wanted to, however I would not say "" you must go"""
I was expecting it to be great because of all the good reviews.. And it wasn't great it was a little less than okay. I was very disappointed .
Waited 3 weeks to come in on a Saturday night and it was worth the wait! The girl and the goat lived up to its hype 100%. My husband and I loved everything we ordered. The names and descriptions were comical. Â I love oysters and we had 2 orders of the cowboy oysters! To die for! Broiled pig face sounds raunchy but sooooo good-- a must try! The cheese gelato went perfectly with the rest of our wine. I love dining in a place that has great food and even better service. The place is rockin' and definitely one of my favorites! Wish there was another location in the suburbs!
"Boyfriend and I went to dinner to celebrate my birthday on Tuesday. I made the reservation, so we didn't get any birthday perks or anything but that's fine. The service was excellent, and our meal was timed out perfectly. We ordered: Summertom bread- hearty bread with tomatoes and served with cream cheese & oil. Super tasty!Green beans- omg delicious. Big portion, which was more than enough for 2 people. Scallops- my personal favorite. Sweetness of the scallops and sauce was balanced with crunchy snap peas. Goat empanadas- these were really tasty. Flaky crust, well seasoned meat, served with crunchy veggies and grilled blueberries. super unique dishPig face- not my favorite of the evening, but really really good. We didn't order dessert, partly because nothing on the menu looked particularly worthy of a birthday dessert. Overall, would definitely go again! fantastic food & service"
"Well, This place blows all the fan fare out of the water. They are putting out some stellar food from that kitchen. The servers know it because they walk around with some swagger. It helps to know that the food is always going to be great. I had tried 4-5 times to get in this place. It has to be the most exclusive place i've ever ate. So, the anticipation was pretty high and the chance for me to be let down was way off the charts. It's almost hard to believe that I wasn't let down. Yeah.. Food was bad arse.I had 6 dishes, all were amazing. I won't bore you with the details, there;s 1200 other reviews that detail every single dish. I'll just tell you this..... You have to come here. You have to make that reservation WAAAAY in advance, like... months, and you have to be prepared to eat like a Boss. You'll drop a couple hundo, no big deal. It's worth it."
Best restaurant in Chicago! S many innovative dishes and flavors. Yum!
Green Bean Casserole Bread.Roasted Beets.Chickpea Fritters.Hamachi Crudo.Grilled Baby Octopus.Oven Roasted Quail.Crisp Braised Pork Shank.BELIEVE the hype!!!! LOVED e'rythang!I wish we had enough time to check out Little Goat Diner.
"I don't understand the high review. Decoration is too over the top and cheesy. Food....oh god. Asian fusion? Yeaaaah. all the dishes had waaaaayyy too strong and conflicted flavors. I guess they were meant to have complex and rich flavors. But I just felt a battle in my mouth and all the favors blasted out, just chaos. I didn't get layers. We just kept on drinking water and drinks.. They were either too salty or too wired to swallow. We ordered 5-6 courses for 2 people and we couldn't remember even one at the end. We came here to celebrate my birthday and ended to be very much regretted of the choice. Never will come back."
"Blueberry pancakes with oat crumble topping is unbelievably good, and large enough to split, if you are so inclined, particularly when you add the mandatory bacon and hash browns!"
"Small dishes, done right, at the right price. Â Definitely a fan of small dishes. Â Hard to get a reservation, but we eventually made it happen. Â House Bread with Tarragon Butter and Pea Puree: Â A+The bread itself was to die for. Â It was a buttery pastry. Â Tarragon butter was incredibly flavorful and went well with the pea puree. Â Would order again.Kale, Beat, Frisee Salad with Avacado Creme Fraiche: Â ALots of flavors going on in this dish, but not overwhelming. Â Flavors worked very well. Â Ingredients were extremely fresh. Â Great stomach opener dish for dinner.Goat Carpaccio with Capers, Trout Roe, Frisee, and Fried Fingerling Potatoes: Â A+Another great appetizer dish with alot going on. Â Flavors were explosive, but meshed well together. Â Really like the use of the trout roe and the gaminess of the carpaccio being neutralized by the capers. Â Terrific use of strong flavors.Escargot Ravioli: Â A+Handmade ravioli with fresh escargot. Â The ravioli skin was cooked perfectly. Â The butter sauce was amazing. Â The escargot was tender. Â Simple dish, a bit heavy on the sauce, but worked very well with the natural richness of the escargot.Beef Tongue, Corn Chips, Frisee, and Pickled Onions: Â A+Beef tongue was divine. Â Cooked to perfection, sliced incredibly thin, and almost melted in your mouth. Â Great flavor offset by the crunchy texture of the corn chips. Â Amazing.Diver Scallops with Hazelnut, Guacamole, and Bok Choy: Â B-Scallops were overdone and rubbery. Â Seared only on one side. Â Too many flavors going on in one dish. Â Dinner was a great culinary adventure until we hit this dish. Â Both of us did not enjoy it. Â There was way too much going on, with barely any flavor of the scallops coming to fruition. Â Pork Belly with Over Easy Egg and Caramel Pesto: Â BPork Belly was deep fried. Â Egg yolk added a nice consistency with the crunch of the pork belly. Â Very rich and flavorful dish. Â A little too much sweetness from the caramel. Â Wish there had been some more pesto on this dish to combat the sweetness. Â It was almost sickening. Â Overall a great dining experience. Â Definitely lives up to the hype. Â Really looking forward to come back again. Â The only true letdown was the diver scallops, but thank you for a great dining experience."
Excellent food. Very sincere chef. Great combination of diff ingredients made great flavor! Â I wanna come back!
"We didn't manage to get a reservation but decided to take a chance and walk in... Girl & The Goat (@StephAndTheGoat) being ranked really high on a lot of US best restaurant list, this was a must try for me. We decided that we wouldn't go to high end restaurant with $200 tasting menu on this trip which I don't mind since I tend to like more casual hip restaurant better.We arrive at dinner plan and was told that there was a one hour wait, but after 20 minutes of wait or so we were given a spot at the communal table Â by the kitchen with a 2 hour limit. It was definitely a bigger space than I have expected, love the huge open kitchen along the back wall with the wood shelves for all the different plates and bowls on display. Love the goat icon on everything from the paper napkin ring, the back of the men and t-shirts of the staff which have a different saying about goat on each of them.Stecca $4~ Love the house cultured butter and the lemony sauce but the bread was very very oily... ~ so oily that you don't really want to touch it and you'll notice that ""oily"" is a theme here. Roasted Cauliflower $11~ pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint~ This seems to be all the rage these days with all the restaurant serving these, so I have to order their version. ~ Although tasty, I find it extremely oily.Escargot Ravioli $15~ bacon, tamarind-miso sauce~ Love the intense sauce, love the fresh pasta and escargot ravioli was a rather strange combination, yet everything work really well together here.Confit Goat Belly $19~ Bourbon Butter, lobster n' crab, fennel~ Again this sat on a pool of oil, why why why all this oil? bourbon butter?.... ~ you could taste the goat flavor really well which we liked but thought it needed a bit of salt, it was rather bland especially with all that oil which tasted disgusting after a bite or so. ~ I found the lobster and crab rather unnecessary since it didn't really go with the dish or meat, Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face $16~ sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red-wine maple, potato stix~ I was so happy when this arrived since it doesn't look that oily but again it was rather bland, dry and that's all I could remember about this dish.Sticky Date Cake $8~ seedling blueberry preserves, montamore gelato & chips~ Dessert was probably the best part of the meal, love the warm date cake with the cheese ice creamBittersweet Chocolate $8~ toffee, shitake-caramel gelato, shitake gastrique~ Are you kidding me shitake gelato, we just had to ordered this. ~ Love the dark chocolate and the shitake actually work and you could actually taste the earthy mushroom flavor. Verdict:~ Loved the space and the service but didn't really like the food.~ I'm not sure if we are spoiled by Toronto food scene or Chicago people have different taste in food since this place was packed to the brim on a Tuesday night.~ Definitely though this was overrated and I don't think I would come back"
"I've been waiting to go here for years now but I've never been able to make a reservation because you need to do it 3 months in advance and I never know my plans that far out. So I finally decided to just go early at 5pm and wait for a table. Luckily there were 2 seats open at the bar so we took those instead of waiting 1+ hours for a table. The bar was nice and the service was good so it was no problem. Like I said, I've been wanting to come here for a while, so I had big expectations for this place. Overall the food was really good, but not as amazing as I had expected. Steamed west coast mussels: 5/5 Â My only complaint is that they give you 2 little pieces of bread and there's so much delicious sauce to soak up! We tried asking for more bread but they won't just give you a few slices, they make you purchase one of their specialty breads.Goat blue bread: 5/5 Although originally a little upset we had to purchase more bread for our mussels, it was worth it. The fig butter it came with was delicious and creamy...I might have even taken a few small spoonfuls of it when the bread was goneEscargot ravioli: 2/5 Super disappointed with this one. I normally like escargot but whatever was in this made it literally taste like dirt. Avoid this dish. Â Sauteed green beans: 5/5 Â SOOO GOOD! If all vegetables were this good I'd be a vegetarianPig Face: 4/5 Flavorful dish that you mix up like a hashGoat shank: 4/5 Tender and fell right off the bone"
"4th visit and a annual pilgrimage when we come to visit. From groups of 4 to groups of 14, the food and service are always spectacular and keep you guessing. Some of the standbys that are on the menu every time keep some favorites while trying new ones each time.The shishito peppers are an all-time favorite and order them to start the meal every time. Not spicy at all!"
"I could go here every night and not be disappointed. Â The only problem is that I have to stop myself from licking the plate. Â We had the recommended 5 dishes. Â The bread called Corn Fedhad corn and bacon in it served with goat cheese butter and a side of corn kernels. Â Delicious. Â The roasted beet salad was good but not my favorite. Â  Scallops were excellent with a great sauce. Â Goat empanadas had sliced carrots, beet chips, and blueberries. Â  Pig Face was my favorite. The combination of crunchy potato sticks, cilantro, and pork made this yet another dish that I could have every time. For dessert, there is no better choice than the Budino - miso, butterscotch, bacon toffee. Â  The best dessert anywhere!We shared the meal as most in the restaurant seemed to do. Â Well worth going to!"
"his is one of the great new american culinary institutions.

"Hands down best restaurant in Chicago. I was working in Chicago for the summer and I had the pleasure of dining here twice. Due to dining here twice, I was able to taste almost everything on the menu. First of all, I highly recommend getting at least one type of bread. Not only is it homemade, the spread is homemade as well. The waitress recommended that we skip on the bread for other dishes on the menu, but honestly splurge and get the bread. You won't regret it. I found that the most recommended are the dishes seen on Anthony Bourdain's show and in most food reviews, and it's difficult to pinpoint one dish since it changes seasonally, but of course the pig face is a must try. I ordered both times and both times I was not disappointed. I think the goat belly is also highly recommended on yelp, but in my opinion, I could skip the goat belly for a couple vegetable dishes; notably the shishito peppers and the broccoli. The broccoli on the menu at the time was an oven roasted dish with rice crispies and it was phenomenal. Next time I'm back in Chicago, I am definitely eating here."
"First off: Didn't make a reservation five months ago before you knew you were going to be in Chicago or even wanted to dine at Girl & the Goat? Well, then show up about 15 minutes BEFORE the restaurant opens, and they will seat you right away once they're actually opened. You can also grab seats in the lounge or at the bar where food is still served, but honestly, get there early, and you can still score an actual table, even on a weekend. Just make sure you are there EARLY because you will not be the only one trying to do this. Still, as long as you're there by the time they open, I think you should be good.Secondly: The food is quite good, but portions are SMALL and pricey. They recommend 2-3 dishes per person (to be shared amongst the table), and that doesn't include bread or starters. This can really add up, but hey, it's fine dining, so what do you expect.Third: As for specific recommendations, I'll just start from the beginning and go through everything we ate. We tried the ""ghums n' roses"" bread. Skip it. The bread was too hard and crusty, and the spreads were nothing to write home about. The table next to us ordered a different type of bread, I think maybe the onion, and it looked WAY better. I was simply suckered into the ghums n' roses bread by the enticement of rosemary honey butter, but it did not live up to expectations. The oysters, however, were good, but they were oysters. Nothing above and beyond really. Next up were the duck tongues. Decent but not my favorite thing we ate. Next was the arctic char. Now THIS, on the other hand, was my favorite thing we ate, at least outside of dessert anyway. This was cooked and seasoned and accompanied so well. I wish we had ordered two! Definite must try. The halibut, however, which came recommended by the server, was a complete letdown. Very bland and unflavorful. Go with the arctic char instead. Confit goat belly was also a bit disappointing. It was very citrusy actually, and while it was tasty, there was more lobster and crab than actual goat belly. It was good, but I just wish the proportions had been better. Goat loin was tasty too. Slightly gamey, but not too bad. Pretty tasty. And then we got to the pig face - one of the main reasons we came here. It's supposed to be eaten as a sort of hash, with the egg, pig face, and other accompaniments mixed together. The men really enjoyed this, but I'm not big on really fatty pieces of meat (I prefer leaner meats) so this was not my cup of tea. Finally, dessert. The miso-butterscotch budino is an absolute MUST. It's basically a butterscotch pudding/flan-like dessert, but it's the bacon toffee pieces that absolutely make this dish. You need to ensure that there is crunch in every bite, and you will seriously swoon. Delicious. The plantain cake was good too, but it just couldn't hold a candle to the incredible budino.Finally: Valet is $11, which for Chicago isn't too bad. Street parking in the area was kind of confusing, so I'd just recommend going for the valet. The restaurant itself is nice but laidback. You can dress up or you can wear jeans. Unless you're in tattered rags, I can't see them turning anyone away, but perhaps at least make yourself look presentable. Oh, and the cutest part of the restaurant? The doggie bag has a picture of a goat with a doggie hat/mask on. Very clever.Overall: I would definitely recommend trying it for an experience, but I will say that it wasn't everything and more than I expected it to be. Good food, but be careful what you pick, and expect to pay a pretty penny."
"When we decided on coming to Chicago, this was one of the must-do items according to the wife. Reluctantly, three months to the day in advance I was able to snag a 9:15PM reservation. I think I did this at 9am, so there were clearly some other trigger happy people ready sitting on OpenTable. I am someone that is definitely very skeptical when said level of hype is achieved.Girl & the Goat ended up being a delicious, and fun, dinner. Walked in and the place was going seemingly bananas for a restaurant. Jam packed restaurant, loud music, bar was also packed, everyone trying to look cooler than the next person. My wife immediately fell in love with the place.Service was casual, completely cool and not cheesy or stuffy. Food came out of the kitchen at lightning speed. Drinks were delivered promptly.Food highlights: My personal favorite was the escargot ravioli, which came out to the soundtrack of Jadakiss blasting on the speakers (thought that was pretty awesome). This is why it was so amazing: I usually think escargot is completely disgusting and inedible. When a restaurant achieves fully changing my mind about something in one fell swoop, I'm impressed. Pig face was okay. Pork belly was awesome.Come here, it's a good time and great food. Not too expensive, either."
"Busier than a one armed brick layer in a war zone.But the wait (2 hours) was well worth it. They have such an amazing array of foods to share. There really isnt much more to say than what everyone else is saying, :""Get your arse here and eat some good food!"""
"Okay yum. This place is just straight up amazing- here' s a little recap of my experienceOur food (for two):- tortone bread- brioche bread- kolhrabi salad- pig face- escargot ravioli- duck tongue- miso butterscotch budino- plantain cakeI loved everything. The bread is worth the $8 because the spreads make it taste so fancy and gourmet. Â I loved both the tortone and brioche. Â The kohlrabi salad was very nice, though much lighter and best as a starter. The infamous pig face was insane (bacon on steroids, yes), and when it was served the waitress gave us a little summary of the dish and advised us that it's best chopped up and eaten like a hash. We took the suggestion and practically licked the plate clean. Â The escargot ravioli was the only thing I probably wouldn't order again. You get 4 ravioli under a bit of sauce and veggies, and while it's a really fun concept, it actually just tastes like escargot inside some pasta. It's well done and definitely worth a try though, especially for escargot-fanatics. Next, I wanted to order the duck tongue because I wanted to have a new weird food to tell people I've tried! I was a little nervous because it does not exactly sound appetizing, but the rave reviews about it convinced me :). Â And my verdict is... it was delicious! Duck tongues indeed look like little mini tongues, but they are also fried and served with some more delicious sauce. The server was very knowledgeable and helpful, and they put your order in according to how they think the food will taste best. Our server wanted us to have the lighter dishes first and get richer and more decadent as we went along, so that is what we did! And we loved it. Dessert was fabulous, especially the miso-butterscotch budino! This is THE Chicago must-try restaurant."
"This restaurant is amazing and the waitstaff is attentive. I went here with my husband a couple years back for his birthday dinner. We still say it was one of the best meals we ever ate. Â We had the Korean pork that was bone in and cauliflower dish, octopus mix and some other dishes. Every dish was delicious and left us full and leftovers for another meal."
"My mother and I went here this evening for the first time and might possibly be the last time. Check-in was fine. Ambiance was way too loud. Staff was very nice. Only item to write home about out of the dishes we tried (chickpea fritters ($14), escargot ravioli ($15), pig face ($18), and goat belly($19)) was the pig face. If I decide to go back I will be getting that again as well as trying the cauliflower, goat empanadas, and goat leg (which must be preordered)."
"We have been here countless times, and each time I love this restaurant more and more! I cannot begin to tell about each experience or plate we have had so many. We have had intimate two person dinners, family dinners and birthday parties. Â We feel we know some of the wait staff who have been around since the opening and it's always funny to have that recognition when dinning. Their wait staff has always been insightful in explaining any changes to the menu and making recommendations. I also like how they stagger the dishes and time them perfectly throughout the experience. They have a food service system that works despite the obvious, they are always slammed. Over our visits a few of the dishes had remained on the menu, they are just so good! My overall favorite I get every time are the SautÃ©ed Green Beans! I just cannot get enough of the warm beans marinated in the flavorful fish sauce. I also recommend the Shishito Peppers and the Chickpea Fitters. They are fun dishes to share with the table (or keep for yourself!). My boyfriend and I usually stick to the fish dishes on the menu because he does not eat meat. As these change all the time I cannot specifically list the best here. However, we have never had a dish we did not like. I do eat meat, however, and feel it a duty to try some of Stephanie's interesting meat creations. I have tried the pig face (pig cheeks) and a pork belly dish. As expected, no complaints from me!Depending on how hungry we are we always try at least one of the bread and butter pairings, many times we cannot make up our mind and just get all three. On to dessert, just order dessert! I had one of the best desserts I've ever had at G&G. It has been on the menu twice and if it ever reappears, get it! (a dark flowerless chocolate brownie with caramel and topped with shitake mushroom gelato (yes shitake mushroom). The flavors worked so well together it was amazing). I asked for this dessert once when it was off the menu and the staff checked in the back and at least brought me some leftover shitake gelato. Â Score!Last, G&G also has a knowledgeable revolving beer menu for the craft beer geek in our group and a nice wine list for the more refined. Make reservations in advance or take a chance to find a seat at the bar. I've never seen the restaurant empty or with room to move around. The smells and dark wood create a warm welcoming atmosphere that's laid back but still remains a part of the go-to-be-scene crowd. Have fun, try new things and enjoy yourself!"
"I went in expecting the food would be weird, but good. Â I came out knowing the food was weird and bad. Â Everything was VERY SALTY and the anchovies in the beet salad made the whole thing taste fishy. Â  I love vegetables and tried most of them on the menu I'd have to say the cauliflower and green beans were the best but still NOT GREAT. Â Oh and the Salmon was the saltiest dish I tasted.Don't get the broccoli it tastes burnt and smokey. Â The La Paloma cocktail did not taste like grapefruit.Wait staff was friendly, atmosphere was nice but I would not go back."
"Maybe my expectations were too high, but I've had better. For the food I would give it 3.5 stars but .5 extra for the atmosphere and the very stylish decor. We had the pork shank (MY FAVORITE), pig face (very fatty and decadent) and the trout (just okay). I thought the dishes were manipulated to the point where the taste is up there but I didn't feel like I was eating the true flavor of the ingredient, if that makes any sense. It was trying very hard, maybe too hard. However, this is for sure one of the top places to go for an overall great dining experience, and the menu items will start some conversations for sure. The only other negative I would say is the acoustics - it was very hard to hear dining partners above the din."
"I'm going to keep this short because there are enough reviews about this place already. Pretty much everything is amazingly good here! The worse we had was the roasted cauliflower and mushroom ragout, but it still was good. The best is hands down the pig face. Everything about this is so so so good. The pork is perfectly cooked and the egg is the icing on the cake.Other things I recommend are sautÃ©ed green beans, diver scallops, steamed west coast mussels, and kona kampachi crudo. Definitely come here with at least 4 people so you can make the best out of it. The portions are small and they are meant to be this way. Pretty much, the wait for the reservation is worth it!"
"I lOVE this place. The food is really adventurous and delicious. They were accommodating to my husbands nut allergy and made it a really special evening. We were given the table at the kitchen counter which was great as we got to watch our food being prepared and chat to the chefs doing it. I've not yet had one dish I didn't like, but particularly notable is the Wood-Grilled Broccoli which we ordered as we felt we should have at least one vegetable and it was sooooo good. Obviously the other dishes are great but this one just surprised us. It is tough to get a table here but trust me, it is worth the wait."
"What a culinary adventure! It started at 4:30pm at the bar. We were among the first to arrive, as we did not have reservations.The bartenders, as well as all of the servers, were laid-back, passionate about the food and wine, and impeccably professional. Part of the fun was ordering the small-plate items embellished with ingredients which I could barely pronounce. Everything tasted simply delicious and was creatively plated. It was fascinating to watch the quick-paced activity in the kitchen, while taking in the complicated taste sensations at the happenin' bar. Girl & Goat was one of the best all-around and memorable dining experiences ever."
"It's been quite some time since I've eaten here since I no longer live in the city, but this place is fantastic."
"Had a great Mother's Day dinner with friends here. It's a little loud, but the food is great and it was fun to share the taste of things with everyone in out group. We had a reservation and were seated promptly; the service was great. Would return."
"Managed to waltz in here one night without reservations at around 10pm, woo! Love the inventive menu. We totally over-ordered. The waitress suggested two plates per person, 3 plates if you're a vegetarian. I accidentally ordered 4 plates because I didn't think bread counted. Turns out it was 2 plates too many. Next time I'd just get one of the bread dishes plus one veggie.The ""not Campbell's"" bread was amazing. Broccoli cheddar bread served with a salty mushroom butter and delicious tomato oil. I think it was only like $4 too.My other fave thing was the grilled broccoli. Almost as good as The Publican's take on broccoli. Such flavorful, charred goodness.The mushroom ragout was a bit of a disappointment--I found it to be too salty. Seemed like it needed more of ravioli pieces to balance it out. I enjoyed the chickpea fritters, but they seemed particularly pricey at $11 for two little fritters.The cirtrusy, spicey Tempest cocktail was fantastic. Friendly server, though we thought it was a bit odd how she never asked us how the food was. Looking forward to returning and ringing up a much smaller bill now that we know how few plates we can handle!"
"Drinks were aaamazing. Â Got the earhart. Â Sister got a concoction the bartender made which was ""little bit of lemon and all booze"" really yummy (pink in color- not on the menu). The bartenders are knowledgeable about both food and drinks. We got here at 8 PM and was an hr and half wait. Thankfully, we stalked people at the bar and got 2 seats and ordered dinner. We got the pig face...so yummy. You have to break the yolk and mix it all. We also got a goat dish. Unfortunately I can't recall the name but it was the last item on the goat menu (with tamarind). Â That was really yummy. Lastly we got the pork shank. We both agreed that it wasn't note worthy. The red sauce made the dish salty and if you eat the pork alone, it is bland. However, after we had a couple drinks and the first two dishes, the pork shank was too much for us to finish.  I'd def come back again."
"This place was incredibly amazing! Â We walked in at 630 sat at the bar to have 2 drinks and waited about an hour for a table. Â Atmosphere is trendy cool and fun. Â Cocktails were delicious. Once we were seated we asked our waitress to choose for us and ended up with the magical beans, pig face, scallops, belly and pbj dessert. Amazing...you have to have to have to try this place!"
"I visited Girl & the Goat a year ago when I was in Chicago for a wedding/vacation with my boyfriend. I made a reservation 2 months in advance through OpenTable since I was looking for a place to treat my boyfriend for his birthday which was around the same time. I could only find a reservation at 10PM but decided to book it anyway. I also requested to be seated at the chef's table if possible mentioning that we were celebrating my boyfriend's birthday.We arrived a little bit early. The decor is very pretty inside with a nice ambiance. We sat at the bar and ordered some drinks until our table was ready. I wasn't sure if the restaurant received my request via OpenTable since it was never confirmed so I was super happy when the waitress led us to the chef's table and then wished my boyfriend a happy birthday (without me mentioning anything). It was nice to know that they try to accommodate your requests and even made a note that we were there for a special occasion.Awesome service!!! Our waitress was fantastic, very friendly and prompt. She recommended that we get about 4-5 dishes for us which turned out to be the perfect amount of food.The chef's table was also a great experience - you're seated right in front of the kitchen so you can see all the dishes being put together. The food was amazing - seriously one of the best meals I have ever eaten so far. We ordered the shishito peppers, grilled baby octopus, pig face (that egg!) and pork shank. We also received a free dish - escargot ravioli. I don't think I would have ever ordered it on my own accord since I never tried escargot before that dish but I would definitely recommend it and probably order it again. At the end of the meal, our waitress brought out a mini dessert dish with a candle for my boyfriend's birthday which was really thoughtful (and delicious).I can't pick a favorite dish because I enjoyed all of them so much! If only I lived in Chicago and could return to try everything else on the menu... It is definitely pricey but well worth it!My boyfriend and I had a memorable meal and experience at Girl and the Goat. He still mentions this place once in awhile. If we're ever in Chicago again, we will definitely be back!"
Unusual and delicious food.
"What can I say about Girl and the Goat that the 2525 other reviews at time of writing haven't already said? Â Admittedly probably nothing, but I feel like I need to tell someone about the amazing meal I had.Lets cut to the chase here. Â Yeah, it's ridiculous that you pretty much need reservations a few months in advance. Â We decided to make this my birthday dinner, and made our reservation for November 10 in June. Â But you know what? Walking in the door 5 minutes prior to your reservation, brushing past the group of tourists and suburbanites that decided to try their luck on a Sunday evening, only to approach the host stand and be taken to your table immediately is the greatest feeling in the world. Â Seriously. Â And you know what a reservation gets you? An actual table. Â Not a seat at the bar, or in that weird lounge thing in the corner by the stairs to the bathroom. Â A real table. Â So just do it. Â Make a reservation. Â Forget you have it (they'll call you multiple times to confirm the week and day of!), and when your time comes you'll be glad you did!The food, as everyone else has already gushed, is fantastic. Â I'm not one for over exaggerating, and I'll be first to tell you if I don't think what I paid was worth it. Â That meal was worth every penny. Â I want to go back, because there are so many more things on the menu I want to try. Â I want to get a big group and order the goat leg. Â I wish I was eating here right now.So here's what we had:Goat Bleu Bread -- Delicious. Seriously, I'm still dreaming of it. It was a focaccia type bread with bleu cheese and onions baked in. Â Served with fig butter and some sort of onions. Â Outstanding on it's own, great with the spreads as well. Â Goat Empanadas - deliciously smoky tasting goat meat inside of empanadas. Â Seriously, how can you go wrong?Ham Frites - this was my ehhh choice but the boyfriend loved them. Â Fries seasoned with, well, ham. Â Tasty, but I just didn't feel like they fit in with our meal.Diver Scallops - Outstanding. Â Deliciously seared scallops in a pumpkin sauce with pomegranate seeds and something else I've forgotten. Â Absolutely delicious.Green Beans - Oh, the green beans. Â In a fish vinagarette with cashews. Â We had them, the tables around us had them. Â They were practically orgasmic. Â Seriously, the girl at the table next to us was pulling a When Harry Met Sally while eating hers. Â If I could just swing by and pick up a to-go container of these and the bleu cheese bread, it would be a heavenly meal. Â We actually had leftovers of these and took them home -- just as delicious when cold. Â Just so unbelievably good. Â Seriously, if you go, and don't get the green beans, I don't even want to be your friend.Apple Buckle - delicious apple crumble with brown butter gelato on top. Â So delicious.And regrettably, a dessert whose name I've completely forgotten. Â It was something delicious though, with pineapple and other things I can't name. Â By this point I was so full (and a little drunk, damn them drinks is strong!) I was just shoving it into my gullet because it was there. Â So deliciously there. Â That dessert came waiter recommended -- he insisted we order it over the PB&J and I'm glad we did. Â Oh dessert, what were you?All of that, plus several beers and a cocktail ran us $120. Â I'd do it again in a heartbeat.The service, on top of everything else, is fantastic. Â Our server (Dan I think?) was hilarious, and didn't hesitate to tell us if he didn't agree with a choice from the menu. Â I have a lot of respect for servers who will tell you if a particular dish isn't as good as everything else. Â There are busboys quietly hovering, ready to take an empty plate or fill an empty water glass as soon as you set it down. Â In retrospect, I wish I'd tipped more than I did, they all deserved it. Â I was concerned going into this meal that it would not live up to the hype, and that I'd walk away disappointed. Â Instead, I toddled off, wishing I was still hungry (I wanted the pig face! Oh well, next time). Â I'm already planning our next reservation, this time with friends involved so that we can justifiably order a larger selection of dishes.So believe the hype. Make a reservation and go. Â You'll be pleased."
"The food here is to wait for, and if you want a normal dining time, wait you shall... For about 3 months. So make your reservation VERY ahead of time unless you want to go before 5:30 pm. Â Ambience: Â Very open restaurant and pretty casual. I love the woodwork everywhere. Â The noise level is average to loud, depending on how crowded it is (it's normally very crowded). Â Service: Â honestly, the host and hostesses were a bit unwelcoming. Â They were very short with us even though we were the only ones in the entrance area. Â But our waiter was pretty hilarious.Food: Â every time you go, the dishes will impress you. Â The only problem is that the portions need to be a bit larger... Â Oh, make sure you share!!!! Â Although after one bite of the lamb ribs or pig face, I'm not sure if you are going to want to share..."
"Small plates... huge, stunning, glorious flavors!!!Love, love, love this place... I would consider moving back to Chicago just to eat here more often. Â THIS is what a restaurant should be... creative cooking... consistency... courteous staff... a true celebrity chef... but one who lives up to they hype and the... dare I say it... genius. Â Everything is so clever and well thought out... the flavors meld and burst and just make me happy.This time there were four of us, so we got to order many more dishes... While some rise to the top, slightly more than others... everything is superb.When I was here last summer I fell in love... Nice to know some relationships can go the distance...Pan Fried Shishito Peppers With Parmesan, Sesame and Miso - This was on the menu then and is a must have now... So tasty. Â I love these peppers simply and traditionally grilled with soy sauce... but this combo is stellar.Sauteed Green Beans With Fish Sauce Vinaigrette And Cashews - Yeah, we all agreed this would get anyone to eat their green beans. Â And we had this last time, too. Â So good!Squash Wontons With Mushroom Ragout - Simple... Delightful, but got lost a little bit because the other dishes were so much bolder. Â I could have lived without this one.""Falafel"" With Peanut Hummus, Cucumber, Apple Salad, Crisp Pita and Marinated Mozzarella - Another really good dish, with a lot of flavors, though the first two will overshadow most things.Grilled Baby Octopus With Guanciale, Beans, Pistachios and Lemon Vinaigrette - Could have used more octopus, but this was one of the evening's favorites.Diver Scallops With Pumpkin Brandade, Fried Brussels Sprouts, Spiced Pecans and Pomegranate - Man I love scallops and I think we all liked this dish the best of all! Â This was just a perfectly balanced plate, where each flavor lifted the next Â to amazing heights.Kalbi Beef Ribs With Sweet Corn Coblettes and Grilled Okra Relish - Another super tasty dish with great flavors.Crisp Braised Pork Shank With Butternut Squash-Shiitake Kimchee, Buttermilk Dressing and Naan - The meat literally fell off the bone and was the second favorite dish of the night. Â Tender, stunning and so tasty. Â Mmmm...Confit Goat Belly With Bourbon Butter, Lobster n' Crab And Fennel - The portion on this was a little small and would have been a better split for two instead of four, but damn was it delicious. Â Thought we might fight over this one... almost did.For dessert we got two things...Miso-Butterscotch Budino With Bacon Toffee, Glazed Pineapple and Candied Cashews. Â This was sweet heaven.And while I was initially not excited about the PBJ Dessert With Ice Cream And Donuts, it, of course, won me over!!!Once again, from perfect start to perfect finish, this spot has proven to be one of my most favorite dining experiences... EVER!"
"Love this place!They take reservation, but we didn't plan it early enough to be able to make a reservation during my short stay in Chicago. Â However, we went there for an early (5:30pm) dinner, and the receptionist recommended that we can wait for app. 45 minutes for a table, or sit at the bar or lounge. Â People, if you don't have a reservation and didn't want to wait: take the lounge! Â It's the most comfortable space ever. Â Yes you might have to share the table with someone else, but who cares, being stuck in a table at the corner with someone sitting next table to you elbowing you is probably worse. Â And their lounge couch is so soft and comfortable.We ordered the pork face--it's phenomenal. Â Must try, period.Chickpea fritter is the softest and probably one of the most delicious creative dishes I've had. Â Another must try. Â We also had the loup de mer. Â It's simply cooked but full of flavor and texture. Â Highly recommended.I had a chance to visit Purple Pig and Girl & the Goat almost back to back. Â I hate to compare them but I personally liked Girl & the Goat a lot better, because their food is a lot lighter, and their flavoring and creativity in combination of indigents are big wins!"
"AMAZING! One of the most enjoyable meals I've ever had. We got the taco bread, oysters (don't remember which ones - boyfriend is an oyster fan, not me), the goat empanadas, escargot ravioli and pig face. I'd recommend them all, but DEFINITELY get the pig face! It's so savory and also has a touch of sweetness to it. And make reservations early - I got this as a last minute recommendation right before my vacation and was luckily able to get a reservation at 10:30. Last recommendation - save room for dessert!"
"I was recommended by many of my peers to give this place a go since I moved from Cali. My friend and I ordered the roasted pig face, beef shank and 2 other dishes I dont recall. My goodness the food was amazing! I figured small dishes werent my style but I was actually full after the meal. The atmosphere is very friendly and intimate. It is easy to make friends and all the servers are extremely informative. They also serve your food in a particular order to provide some sort of theme that elevates your food experience. Definitely, take some time out and try this place!"
"The only reservation over a MONTH in advance was at 11:30PM. Â Bananas. Â Better be good. Â Better not be a complete salt lick. Â Many of the items were. Â I can see why GG is popular: great energy, maybe too much? Â We had a group of overgrown cougars cackling over our table, yes they attach small counters on the side of some tables. Â URGH. Â Prices, can't be beat, I think it was about $150 for 9 items, two glasses of wine and a beer. Â My problem? Â Too much creamy sauce, too much salt and too many fried toppings. Â Overdone comfort food. Â I really enjoyed the pig face, beef cheeks and cauliflower. Â The rest were really heavy and the escargot ravioli, the flavor of the bug were lost. Â Would venture back, but only if an early time were available and would only order a few bites."
"(Come on #Chicago- is that all it takes to impress you?!) #GirlandtheGoatGirl and the Goat is (supposedly) all the rage in Chicago. I had to see for myself what this venue had to offer. It was hard to schedule a table with only a few days to pick from, but not impossible. So far so good. They also let me change our party reservation from 2 to 3 at the eleventh hour. Good stuff. The dining space was warm and well lit but very noisy and tight on space. We never got comfortable especially where leg room was concerned. Â As soon as we were seated, water was poured and the waiter started to explain the tapas style menu. We asked about their recommendations and popular dishes, but with a revolving menu, it is plain to see what favourites have made a lasting impression on city diners.APPETIZERSWe opted for the MUSHROOM BREAD variety and enjoyed the moist warm bread, and the tomato olive drizzle almost as much as the mushroom paste. Nothing extraordinary, but a great alternative to regular bread paniers. They recommended the hummus version but we went against the grain on this one, pun intended. THE GOAT EMPANADAS were next up. These were slightly too salty but well dressed with a cream cheese onion and tomato garnish that dialed down the sel. Pretty good. GOAT LIVER MOOSE- This was a popular dish. We ordered it later because we realized we had more room after our entrees, but I'm glad we did. The crumpets were warm and gooey, and the grilled orange-rines compot was my favorite spread. The pickled cawliflower and regular pickles were not a delectable match at all. The Goat Moose jam, was just a-okay. Â  Truthfully, Â I could have eaten the biscuits on their own so this item is still worth the buy but not the fuss.THE BABY OCTOPUS also failed in my eye. Greatly in fact. This new addition to the menu needs to be taken back to the drawing board. The shallots, beets, and bean salad was too acidic, though I liked their treatment of the green and white beans (blanched to perfection). The octopus had no taste, especially after our wonderful octopus treat at Carnivale the night before (see my full review).ENTREESTHE BEEF CHEEKS are actually on the entree menu but the serving is so small, even for a tapas approach, that nearly marked it down as an appy. I really enjoyed the fun textures here- slippery beef, crunchy oniony stix, all swimming in a broth bath. This was one of my favorite dishes but I was the only one so satisfied. The rest of the table did not enjoy this plate at all. Â ESCARGOT RAVIOLI- The snail was tender and chewy, and well seasoned, but the sauce was, again, way too salty. We could barely finish this plate, small as it was.Going by previous yelpers' enthusiasm, I knew I wouldn't leave without trying the infamous WOOD-ROASTED OPEN PIG FACE. As per usual, the waiters encouraged us to mash it all up for a full flavour explosion. Â I did enjoy the combo of the fried eggs, potato stix and the barbecued meat, but this is nothing you couldn't pull off at home, and that says a lot about a dining experience. Bold creation, puttered execution.DESSERTMISO-BUTTERSCOTH BUDINO- When it came time for dessert, we had room for one and only one pick, to be shared three ways. We took Antonio's recommendation and gave the Budino a try. Â I liked the marriage of bacon toffee and cashews, and the feel of foamy whip on candied pineapple, but I didn't get butterscotch in my spoonfuls. Â It was a nice finish but didn't taste as good as it sounded or looked, a theme for the night I'd say.Overall, the fusionistic approach to menu and meal creation is admirable, and service and staff give you a pleasurable dining experience , but most of the courses didn't impress us, and NONE impressed ALL of us.Everything comes in a small portion and I can't help but think this is part of the marketing genius behind this restaurant cause we could not have eaten many bites of any of it. I will add that this was a midway value given the number of courses we had and our $60 bottle of wine- three diners parted with $75 each after a handsome tip. Not bad. At the end of the day, fancy titles don't mask what's really going on here. An interesting menu born out of a creative mind but not worth more than a free trial. Even the waiter had to admit the ''drip coffee'' was nothing more than coffee on marketing steroids. I RECOMMEND: The empanadas to meat lovers and the breads and cheeses to vegetarians.EXTRA TIP: Ask your waiter what's new on the menu since it changes, and stick to the old!"
"It was a good place to share food with friends since they do tapas style. We had corn fed bread, roasted cauliflower, escargot ravioli, pork shank, goat empanadas, and bittersweet chocolate. They were tasty, but not so much as expected as I read overwhelming reviews about how awesome this place is before trying it.They food was a bit too heavy and salty for me, but full of flavored indeed. Do not recommend the escargot ravioli. It tastes different from regular ravioli and is a bit weird.Very friendly and helpful service from the waiter."
"Service was great, food was great. I seriously have no complaints. It's a place everyone should go at least once."
"This place is awesome! Â I made reservations for a birthday and much to my surprise when we arrived they provided us with a spot at the chefs table. To watch them work and prep the food was an ""awe"" moment. The food was great, the service was also great. Can't wait to go back."
"First time went out with a group of friends. Ambiance is lovely and great. The food is definitely good, but not as exceptional as I been told. Everything is a tad heavy, but is expected. The goat empanadas are definitely worth trying. Ham frites and short ribs were good, but did not wow me. The goat empanadas were definitely my favorite. I will come back, as the service was amazing."
"Oysters, pasta, and shishito peppers= delicious! The pig face entree left something to be desired, as I wasn't a fan of the sweet syrup on it, but if you're into a sweet + savory breakfast-style dish, you might like it. Â Overall, great!"
"Fantastic experience. To our pleasant surprise our waitress was our former waitress from Miami. She is always great. The food was spectacular. Each dish showcases finesse, and true Chef skill. If was nice to see Chef expediting the restaurant. Â Great place."
"Girl & The Goat provides an excellent dining experience. Make a reservation now so you can enjoy all of its goodness in like, 3 months. My friend and I were both in Chicago for the weekend and luckily -- scored a reservation from a local friend who decided he didn't want to go to G & G. Score. The service was impeccable. We received honest recommendations from our server-- much appreciated guidance and direction for the two of us who were having trouble making decisions. 4:15 to Georgia and Bolt Action -- both delicious. Miso Hungry - seriously, I didn't think bread could taste this good. We loved everything: crudo, kohlrabi salad, empanadas, chickpeas -- but the sugo paparedelle was really the highlight. A ragout done perfectly -- I don't think I've had pasta this delicious since I was traveling in Tuscany. It was that good. (Note - I found the kohlrabi and empanadas to be a bit on the salty side. Not totally unacceptable, but dangerously close) The meal was completed with a perfect dessert (the chocolate one) -- my friend believes it's the best dessert she has had in her life. That's a big statement, but it was this perfect collision of sour, sweet, salty goodness. And, a rarity (at least, I find), a perfect, unburned espresso at the end. Le sigh. Â Yahoo! Get there, you'll love it."
Went here for a girls night..great food overall! We all ordered two entrees each and sampled everything. Each dish (although small in serving) was filling and so tasty! Service was great and they even gave us an extra entree on the house. They were also playing awesome music and the overall vibe of the place was great for a girls hangout. Def coming back! If you have eclectic taste in food and love trying new things....come to Girl and the Goat!
"I normally do not even consider going to these types of fancy food places that emphasize meat because the veggie options are so weak and boring it isn't worth the effort or price. Â But a friend of ours gave us a gift card so we ventured out. Â Everything was stellar. Service:We made reservations for a weeknight several weeks in advance, which is annoying, but our table was ready when we walked in. Â The server was very prompt and friendly, but not too stiff, and was able to joke around with us. Â I never felt too ignored or too intruded upon. Atmosphere: It is dark and cozy which is nice. But they do really pack you in so expect to be able to overhear your neighbors conversation. But in the end it is loud enough and once we settled in, I felt comfortable and not too cramped. Â i am not sure I would have said the same thing for the table of three smooshed together on the table a few down from us. Â Food:There is a nice cocktail list and my husband loved his whiskey concoction. Â Again I had had my worries about ordering here as my husband and I have a strange assortment of dietary restrictions right now. He eats no meat, I eat no grains and only fish for meat. Â But despite these restrictions, it was very easy to find something to share and have for ourselves. Â We shared the kohlrabi salad, which was a unique and refreshing way to start off the meal. My husband then got his pot stickers. I tried the sauce and could tell it was very smokey flavored. Â Then the famous green beans. Â Huge portion of cheesy salty caramelized onion cashew goodness. Â But the highlight for me was the halibut. I was not sure how almond butter and blueberries were going to go with fish, but IT DOES. This dish is what I wish all food experiences could be. Â Nothing on the dessert menu spoke to us personally, so we ended quitting there."
"The food here blew my mind. Â Green beans in fish sauce with cashews. Â Roasted beets. Â Halibut. Â Wood-fired Scallops. Â Every dish was spot-on. Â Portion sizes were just right for two people to split. Â With two glasses of wine, our bill was $100--really reasonable for a great meal in the city. Â I can't WAIT to go back. Â I will, however, go when I can make a reservation; our service in the lounge area wasn't bad, but it definitely wasn't personal or particularly noteworthy."
"This entire dining experience was an assault on all of my senses in the greatest possible way! The only reservation we could get was at 4:45, so we arrived on a bright afternoon to dine. Cocktail list may need a little work. I also wasn't super impressed their only vodka offering was Tito's. I'm not really into places that are trying to make my drink decision for me. The wine list had some decently affordable options.We ordered:Oysters Rockefeller- nice presentation, tasty but not life-changingFried Pickles- served almost tempura-style, with great sauces.Grilled Baby octopus- Our ""salad"" choice. Very tender, and a great lemon vinagrette.Goat Empanadas- I've never felt bad about choosing an empanada with anything inside.Kona Kampachi Crudo- I learned what a caperberry is on this dish. Great fish and the slivers of pork belly were a fun addition.Lamb Ribs- Amazingly tender meat, great sauce and the lamb was a nice rib change.Pig Face- My favorite on the menu! I liked it so much I ordered a second one! The best parts of the pigs face cooked to perfection, topped with a sunny-side up egg and with the tiniest of potato slivers.Cheese Plates- Another highlight. I enjoyed the jam parings that came along with the cheese. The perfect way to end this feat.I also really liked the layout of the restaurant. Typically if I'm engrossed my my food I don't pay too much attention but I loved the industrial warehouse turned warm fireside dining room. The music is a great hip-hop influenced vibe and everything from that to the waiters really just made me want to stay here much longer and soak it all in."
This was an interesting experience. Â What I'm most perplexed by is the hype around this restaurant. Â The food is ok. Â The service is good.They have a very interesting cocktail menu that I suggest you go for. Â  I was told to try the cauliflower. I did. Â I still don't get it. Â Nothing special about it. Follow the hype if you must. Â I'm here to tell you that it's not as amazing as you hear.
Hubby and I went on a date night here and had a great time. Really fun ambiance and a diverse menu with lots of unique options. Our faves were the goat empanadas and the scallops but everything was really good. The service was prompt and friendly but not overbearing. It's not the best food I've had in Chicago but definitely in the top 5!!!
"I was coming from Toronto to celebrate my partners birthday who was looking forward to dining here. Unfortunately they were booked so I emailed them to explain and less than 24 hours I received a reply advising they can squeeze us in. Well, I would have to say one of the best meals of our lives! Once we arrived we were taken to the chef's table and what an amazing view of the kitchen, kudos to all the chefs who did an excellent job! Our waiter was superb, very friendly and attentive. We started with an order of the brioche buns which were so fresh and yummy. We ordered the broccoli and cauliflower dish- now I love vegetables as it is but man, these were so delicious! Our meat dish was Walters chicken which was filled with flavour- it was so moist and tender. Our waiter then surprised my partner with a dessert for her birthday. Overall, a beautiful experience, great restaurant, great staff and amazing food! I know that the next time I go to Chicago I will book ahead and this time I'll be dining there more than once!"
"How many times can you say ""MMMmmmmm"", ""YUMMY"", ""This is the best food I've ever had in one night""? I'm not sure, but I think I broke a record last night.Girl & The Goat deserves all of the hype and is certainly worth waiting a whole month to go to.6:30 reservation on a Tuesday night, promptly seated (early!), great table (read: not really near anyone else and on the raised level).Service: On Point. Explained the menu, answered questions, checked in the perfect amount of times.The suggestion of 2-3 plates per person is right. We had one diner who didn't have a huge appetite, so we could have gone with one less dish or maybe swapping it for something lighter.Their pinot noir by the glass was wonderful. I skipped the cocktails after reading that they were just OK.Here's what we ate:-Miche Mash bread. Multigrain, hearty and a little sour. Served with a delicious cream cheese-Warm Olives. Exactly that.-Raw Kusshi Oysters. Didn't try, but my co-diners approved.-Chickpea Fritters. Bursting with flavor, not too greasy.-Goat Liver Mousse. Intense flavor, served with huge, lightly crispy crumpets.-Diver Scallops. Only two for the table of four, but large and perfectly cooked.-Grilled Shrimp. This was my least favorite and by least I mean, it was still delicious, but would have sacrificed it to try something else. Eat a bite with the blood orange. DO IT.-Wood Fired Walter's Chicken. JUICY. Perfect crispy skin, Plantain mash was delectable. The coconut really made this stand out.-CRISP BRAISED PORK SHANK. This is an absolute must. Fall off the bone, served with buttermilk ranch and korean style buffalo sauce. WHAT.-Plantain Cake. The cream cheese chocolate chip gelato stood out more than the cake itself.-Miso-butterscotch Budion. (Complimentary birthday dessert!) This is THE dessert to get. The waiter described it as a mix between butterscotch pudding and pineapple upside down cake. He was right.I think our only fault in ordering was not realizing how much starch came with a couple of the dishes, including the crumpets with the mousse and the naan with the pork shank. Coupled with the fritters, we unintentionally filled up fast. Also, the noise level is a factor. Between the music and the din of a full restaurant, it's nearly impossible to hear the person across from you without raising your voice. I would not consider this a ""romantic"" dining experience, just FYI.I hope I get the chance to come here again, as this was truly one the best dining experiences I've ever had."
"I was aware that Girl and the Goat was incredibly popular, but was dining alone in Chicago on a Thursday night, so I decided to give it a try. Predictably, they were slammed. I thought about trying somewhere else, but decided to wait at the bar for a seat. What followed was almost a perfect dining experience.I got a seat after about 5 minutes. The bartenders were attentive throughout the dinner, chatting about food options and drinks even though they were busy. The food was amazing. I had green beans, goat empanadas, and the pig face. Also had a great butterscotch pudding dessert.I wasn't surprised by the amazing food, but the service was a pleasant surprise. They are a seriously well-run operation to deliver such a great experience even when really busy."
"I know I was supposed to go insane over G&TG, especially since I've waited a total of 8 months to finally get here (a combination of the time it takes to get a good reservation and one reschedule on our part) but I would have to say it was just ""good""...Girl & The Goat was Good. Â We arrived with our party of eight - a group of foodies who have been eating their way through a variety of food genres for more than 5 years. Â We were seated 10 minutes early at an amazing table with comfy chairs right by the open kitchen so we could see the ""ballet-like"" precision that goes into making a restaurant like this one so successful. Â I really liked the vibe - driven partly by the music, room decor and engergy of the staff when you arrive. Â Our server, Lyndsey was very good too - helpful and very suggestive about options we could order since it was our first visit (for three of the couples). Â We started with some drinks and onion bread. Â I didn't taste the bread but I enjoyed the flavor of my La Paloma cocktail regardless of the fact that they probably used an atomizer to add the alchohol. Â  After getting overwhelmed by the option of everyone at the table throwing out suggestions for what to order, we decided that each couple would pick a few items to share and the rest of the table would dig in as they felt compelled to. Â We told Lyndsey about our plan and I asked her, if we really enjoyed a particular item and needed more, we could just order more, right? She responded with ""the kitchen asks that you order everything all at once"" - well then....we'll stick with our plan and take our lumps. Â She also told each of us that we probably didn't order enough food - ""is that ok""?? Â  Yes...15 small plates for the table will be just fine...and it was more than enough. Â I'm not sure how much people actually eat at G&TG but we felt more than adequately served and comfortably full - so don't succumb to the pressure to order more than you really want - unless you feel like taking home leftovers. Â  We ordered the Green Beans, Halibut and Pig Face (because that's all I ever hear about when G&TG is mentioned). Â The others ordered multiples of ours and additional plates like the Roasted Cauliflower, Pork Shank, Skirt Steak, Lamb Ribs, Goat Empanada, Mussels and a few of the salads. Â My favorites were the Goat Empanada and the Halibut along with the vegetables (beans and cauliflower). Â I was unimpressed with both the pork shank and the pig face which to me tasted like charred thick cut bacon, eggs and hashbrowns mixed together. Â The Halibut was actually the most uniquely flavored and interesting meal of the evening with an amazing sauce and what looked like enokitake mushrooms - amazing. Â We followed up our meal with coffee, tea and a few desserts. Â I thought the prices were reasonable for the portion sizes and quality of the food and experience. Â Most of us agreed on the way home that it was a good experience - but not one that we feel the need to repeat very often."
"As other have said, really what's to say that hasn't already been said? I thought I'd add my two cents by ranking everything I had and saying what I most liked about it so here goes!Ranked from favorite to least favorite: 1. The Green Beans. I know, it's a veggie! How could it be number one on the list? It's the most flavorful, crunchy green beans I have ever tasted! Very savory and delicious, just fullllll of flavor! My friend and I could not stop eating this dish. Absolutely get it! 2. Close second: The pig face. Wouldn't have ordered it had it not been for all of the magnificent reviews about it! Our waiter and the chef recommended that we just mix everything (open the egg and mix it all together) instead of splitting it down the middle because if we do so, we might miss some of the flavors. Great recommendation! A great mix of sweet and savory, and melt in your mouth pig face! As others have mentioned, it definitely doesn't look like pig face, so no worries there. Anyway, definitely delicious!3. The miso butterscotch budino. Delicious!! Our waiter recommended it and we were a little skeptical because the description wasn't very compelling, but the description definitely didn't do it justice. It had a nice sponge cake and all the flavors (the candied cashews, the whipped cream, the cake, the toffee, the pineapple) all came together to give a nice flavor that wasn't too sweet. Since my sweet tooth is not as prominent as that of some others, this was the perfect dessert for me (although I didn't taste the bacon...not necessarily a bad thing, just a note, it's not a strong flavor). 4. The goat blue bread. Soooo delicious. Very savory bread with lots of flavor. I love goat cheese so this was definitely the bread for me. I wasn't crazy about the onion jam, so I preferred the fig butter with it. Very good! 5. The miso hungry bread. This was a little bit toned down compared to the miso bread. The apple sauce spread was delicious! The bread was great, but not as good as the goat blue. So you can't really go wrong, but it depends on if you want a bread that has a more subtle flavor (miso) vs. one that is packs a nice punch (goat blue).6. The goat empanadas. I may have eaten this wrong, since there were a lot of toppings and elements to it that I didn't really get to incorporate (I took the one on top and my friend took the one on the bottom). It was good, but I felt the goat filling could have been a little more seasoned. It tasted a little plain, but I was still quite impressed by everything! Will definitely be back! Next time I will try the cauliflower since I heard that was also an amazing dish. Also, the service was great. The chef came out and described all the dishes in great detail. The waiter was super nice and friendly and gave us recommendations Â when we asked for them (and great ones at that!). Loved our experience there!! I highly recommend it!"
"Tasty selections impeccably executed. I'm more than impressed. Hard to get a reservation but if you can eat closer to 10pm, there's always hope.Duck breast with kimchee, pork shank with lobster, cauliflower, grilled octopus, goat belly with lobster, miso butterscotch bacon pudding to end it gracefully."
The general consensus seems that if you don't have a reservation just stake out a spot at the bar.. if you go early/ right when they open you'll probably be able to grab a seat immediately.. during peak dinner times the bar area is completely crowded and people start waiting around you while you're eating so they can grab your seat when you leave..was in chicago for the weekend and one of our friends recommended this place so we had it on our list of places to eat at before we left.. my friends and i sat at the bar about 10 minutes before the place officially opened.. for three girls we ordered about 6 dishes.. the waitress said it was a tapas style plating system and ~2 plates per person is enough.. 6 dishes for 3 girls was MORE than enough food.. we were so full by our 4th plate... but we had to keep eating so we could try everything.. some of the foods are a bit on the saltier side.. but all in all it was a highly enjoyable meal.. the more memorable thing about this place is their bread.. order one of their bread dishes.. the accompanying sauces are so delicious!!!!! i think i dreamed about the bread that night.
"Honestly, Girl and the Goat lives up to the hype. It was one of the best dining experiences I've had. I think it took about a month for my sister and I to get a reservation but it was worth it...even though it was at 430 on a Monday. Anyway, it was cold and snowy outside, SO atypical of Chicago in February. Street parking was hard only because of the piles of snow and ice not being plowed but we survived.My sister and I were seated right away and of course at this time is when the restaurant just opened, but there was a good trickle of people coming in after us. Hunter was our server that evening and he was great. He recommended about 2-3 dishes per person and actually stopped us when we got to five, but we ended up with 7. Oops.I loved the beet salad: cool, citrusy, and crunchy. I think there was enough for 2-3 portions between my sister and me. The grilled baby octopus was not chewy and cashews added some nuttiness to the dish.I cannot wait to come back here, especially now that the weather is warming up and they have some tables outside. Love, love, love."
"Not really sure what I can add here that 3300 other reviews haven't mentioned. All the dishes I tried were excellent, my favorites being the scallops and pig face (note: while you see what the pig face looks like in the pictures, what they tell you to do is to chop it into a hash). Also tried the sea bass and wood fired broccoli. We had seats in front of the open kitchen, and it was fun to watch the cooks do their thing. The desserts were outstanding and the service was real top notch. Everyone on the staff who interacted with us was very friendly, helpful, and overall the place has a great vibe. One last thing- the prices were much lower than I thought they would be. Definitely a place to try to get reservations to if you can."
"Good food. Nice atmosphere. Chill yet happening. Dark wood paneling. Servers wearing t-shirts w/ funny pork puns, but they really know their sh*t. Also seems to be a happening post-work dinner spot for a the finance crowd - I came w/ my parents but were surrounded by guys in suits. Our server, who was pretty cute I'll admit, did spend a good amount of time flirting w/ them. I understand though - gotta make rent!MUST-HAVES: Diver Scallops, Pig Face, Pumpkin Pie Gelato!!* double barrel - 2.5 stars (cocktail: old forester bourbon, pierre ferrand 1840 cognac, blenheim gin, lemon, angostura bitters. $13)I told our server what I like (light, refreshing, tart cocktails, maybe w/ ginger) & she recommended this bourbon based drink. However, it was just WAY too strong for me (I am a lightweight, but I can normally at least handle a heavier drink!). She was kind enough to replace this w/ my second choice below.* best of three - 4 stars(russian standard vodka. pimm's #1. cucumber. lime. $13)Much lighter, more refreshing, tart than the double barrel - I liked it!* chickpea fritters - 3.5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦cross-section: yelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(stewed apple-tomatillo . prairie fruits chevre)Nicely done, great flavors, the fritters are incredibly soft & moist. Just wish there was more texture/crisp to the fritters - it ends up being more of a 'mushy' dish, as delicious as it is. I just usually associate a good crunch w/ fritters.* diver scallops Â - 5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(pumpkin brandade . fried brussels sprouts . spiced pecans . pomegranate)WOW. Every bite was an orgasm in my mouth. Not only were the scallops themselves seared perfectly, but EVERY SINGLE ingredient added a unique twist the melded together to form this multiple-orgasm of a dish. * escargot ravioli - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦cross-section: yelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(bacon . tamarind-miso sauce)A little disappointing. The crunchy pieces were good for texture, but the ravioli itself had very little filling (you wouldn't even be able to tell it's escargot - tasted like mushroom). The broth is very thin & simple, w/ a strong savory flavor. Just not much to brag about.* goat ribs - 3.5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(ancient pepper-grape relish . goat chorizo . brussels)A unique mix of flavors. There were only 2 ribs, which made it hard to share between the three of us, but the meat that was on the plate was pretty good - tender, great flavor. * sauteed green beans - 3 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(fish sauce vinaigrette . cashews)For how much people rave about this, I really don't think it was that great. Yes the green beans themselves were nice & crispy, but they were also very oily, & the fish sauce added a kind of sour tang that I really don't think is the best for complementing this vegetable.* roasted cauliflower - 2.5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint)Once again.. I was disappointed. Maybe the bar was just set really high for these two veggie dishes w/ everyone recommending it in their reviews. The cauliflower I found to be a little on the soggy side (I'm Chinese & Â prefer my vegetables crispy) & the flavor not particularly memorable. * crisp braised pork shank - 4 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(butternut squash-shiitake kimchee . buttermilk dressing . naan)The meat = GREAT. Tender, soft, hearty. The dressings - delicous. The naan - OUT OF THIS WORLD! Fresh out of the oven it seemed, chewy-gooey with a good crisp. The kimchee - meh, pickled flavors aren't my thing.* wood oven roasted pig face - 4.5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stix)Oh this one IS worth the hype. The meat is super savory, super crispy, super good. Definitely get it!* pumpkin pie gelato - 5 starsyelp.com/biz_photos/girlâ¦(spiced cake . spiced pecans . blackberries . thai whipped cream . left hand milk stout)HOLY CRAP this was so good!! Another orgasm in my mouth.. but sweet & pumpkin flavored!"
"Love this place. Everything we ordered was perfect!I was surprised we were able to make a reservation. I checked on a Saturday for a reservation for the upcoming Monday.. And we found something! Granted it was a 5pm reservation. But what the heck. We went for it. My favorites were the Pig Face, Skirt Steak, and Goat Empanadas! Â You must order these dishes! The drinks were good.. Nothing too out if the ordinary. My husband ordered the old fashioned, my best friend ordered the Paloma, and I just ordered a glass of wine. Be prepared to spend some money.. The dishes are priced a little high and the portions are small. But definitely worth it when you have a taste of each dish."
"Absolutely Incredible!! Â The food and service was beyond our expectations!! Â Everyone we dealt with was very knowledgeable about the food. Â They explained the various dishes in great detail, how much too order and how to serve up certain dishes. Â Everyone must try the pig face!! Â It is PHENOMENAL!! Â It just melts in your mouth!! Â James the Maitre'd is awesome!! Â He was very kind to assist us with a reservation and was extremely accommodating!! Â We will definitely go next time we are in Chicago!! Â  I highly recommend anyone visiting the Chicago area to stop by and try it out!!"
"I don't know what I can say about this place that hasn't already been said, but I can agree that it is an AMAZING, transcendent dining experience. Getting a reservation in a timely manner is hard, but it's worth the wait. As a vegetarian, I did love everything on the menu (except the wontons), and so did my vegetarian dining companions. The desserts were to-die-for. The dessert wine was to-die-for. This is a place that is good for groups, and great for sharing. And the server on my first trip here, Brendan, made our experience truly truly magical. As I said, transcendent experience."
"Came here based on recommendations and all the hype. Â The food was good, but overall a very hurried rushed experience. Â They warned us ahead of time that we would only get an hour and a half at the table due to a reservation coming after us. Â We were finished in 45. Â The plates came out almost the second we ordered them. Â I can't remember a dining experience that was so rushed and forced. Â The guy at the table next to us even complained that his food came out to quickly so it clearly wasn't just us having that experience. Â I can understand a restaurant wanting to turn tables quickly but a little warmth would go far here. Â Was more of a quick bite than a great dining experience unfortunately."
"Oh how I wanted to love Girl and the Goat! Â I was sure this would be a slam-dunk winner winner chicken dinner! Â However, while most everything I ate was good, this place just plain doesn't do it for me.The seating IRKS me. Â We were so close to the tables next to us that we had conversations with couples on both sides of us (LOL and even shared some food!). Â It was good to stay on pleasant terms with your neighbors, since each time you want to get up the table next to you gets a close up shot of your ass as you wiggle on out. Â Also, since there's no room for the server to approach your table, while they're talking to you they're behind one person who either has to Exorcist their head around or just accept that they can't look at the person who is talking at them. Â We were in Chicago for a week and saw plenty of places pack 'em in, but this place was the worst.We ate the pretzel bread, which was great, the goat mousse which was tasty but way too rich to be served with the monstrous crumpets, a very yummy chick pea dish that ended up being the favorite, scallops which were just plain too salty to eat, and the pig face which we also found way too salty to enjoy. Â This was the richest meal I have ever eaten! Â I eat dessert 99% of the time when dining out, but I had to pass as I was about to enter a food coma. Â I wish that the menu had made more sense - some items were small and some were ginormous. Â I think maybe I would have enjoyed my meal more here if I had ordered differently? Â Unfortunately there was nothing about our visit that would warrant a second trip so I'll never know. Â I loathe being a hater, but Yelp has only very rarely led me astray and this place was a serious let down.3 cocktails, bread, and 4 dishes was $112 for anyone wondering about price. Â It would have been a fine price to pay had two of the dishes been a whole lot better."
"The first time I went to Girl & the Goat, one of my friends had made reservations months earlier and invited me at the last minute, so I didn't have to wait. Â I made a reservation on Open Table in September for mid-November at the first normal dinner time I saw. Â I heard that you could get reservations quicker than that, so I stalked Open Table pretty regularly. Â On a Monday night a few weeks back, I found an opening at 6:45 for two days later. Â Score! Â I met my boyfriend there, and we were seated immediately at table in the corner against the wall that was pretty isolated. Â We both ordered cocktails (a Manhattan & a Best of Three) and and began to pour over the menu. Â I only eat seafood, and he's a meat-eater, so it is always a little challenging to order at shared plates places. Â I had dreamed about the broccoli since my last visit, so that was high on my list.The cocktails were pretty standard; I'm going to be a little bit more adventurous next time. Â And, I wish I had ordered a glass of wine with my meal. Â Oh well, there's always next time. Â For food, the server recommended that for two, you order about five plates. Â We went with the fried pickles, the wood-grilled broccoli, the steamed West Coast mussels, the country fried loup de mer, the pig face, and a goat empanada. Â I didn't try the last two dishes, but I was told they were amazing. Â The pickles are homemade and were out of this world good. Â The broccoli was just as good as I remembered and was a huge portion. Â I wasn't impressed by the West Coast mussels. Â I mean, they are good, but they are not the best I've ever had. Â And, the country fried loup de mer was amazing. Â It was definitely my favorite dish of the entire meal. Â The flavor of everything is just outstanding. Â The order in which dishes are served is perfect. Â The service is great. Â Overall, it was a perfect meal.We left super, super full, and both agreed that Girl & the Goat lives up to the hype. Â I just wish reservations weren't so hard to come by. Â I have heard you can walk in or call for other tables they hold for reservations, but I haven't tried that yet. Â I can't wait until next time!"
"The fact that you have to wait longer for a reservation at this place than Moses waited in the desert is an ominous harbinger. Slowest service ever. I don't know if our waiter was taking smoke breaks or getting lost in Narnia, but hell, I could've read Homer's ""Odyssey"" just waiting to get my water refilled. My poor mom almost missed her flight, and we intentionally scheduled dinner THREE HOURS before her boarding time! I've seen ceramic pottery solidify faster than my food was prepared. Ridiculous."
"I've been here twice and already made my reservation for a third time, things that you HAVE to get in my opinion:-smoked broccoli rabe-pig face-one of their bread and butter selections-beet and avocado saladI ordered all the recommended menu items the first time I went and tried new ones the second time, including the chickpea fritters and tempura loud de mer filet, both would go but I'd stick with what people are consistently recommending to order, especially if you've waited three months to get inSIDE TIP: I read on yelp to request the chef's table or kitchen side table, whatever you call it, my mother and I were lucky enough to request it when we arrived for dinner and snag it and it was a once in a lifetime experience, we basically sat with the chef's making the meal in our lap and received free samples and three free dishes during the night, we got to sample so much of the menu and it was amazing, DEFINITELY REQUEST IT IF YOU CAN, keep in mind its only available for parties of two"
"Overall - the chef takes risks that work out for the most part.We are from LA and we come to Chicago once a year during the brutal winter to spend holidays with the family. Â Since we are LA wimps, we pretty much only make it out of the hotel room to eat and drink. Â That said, every meal must count and we FINALLY got a reso at Girl & the Goat (after failed attempts last 2 years)First surprise was getting seated at the CHEF's TABLE. Â I think there are 4 seats total - 2 on each side of the kitchen line. Â If you are a party of 2, I would recommend putting in a request to sit at one of these seats - it is very cool to watch the kitchen at work and you can see all the food that people order!Now to the food...KOHLRABI SALAD - I was not expecting to order this, but it was recommended by our server and it was UNIQUE and DELICIOUS.BAY SCALLOPS - smoky and tasty.ESCARGOT RAVIOLI - I was very excited about this dish b/c I love escargot, but this was our least favorite. Â It wasn't bad, but definitely least impressive of all the dishes we tried. Â I would have just preferred eating escargot the classic way with garlic/butter.GOAT EMPANADAS - this was also recommended by server and was quite tasty.PIG FACE - this dish appears to be highly recommended by most, but we thought it was just ok. Â A bit on the salty side. Â MISO BUTTERSCOTCH BUDINO - a bit busy.. Â but still tasty.Bottom line: Â We would come back and get the kohlrabi salad, scallops, and goat empanadas again."
"Probably the most fun I've ever had eating a meal. The food was ""different"" but very well prepared. Our waitress was knew the menu top to bottom and gave us some great recommendations. The duck tongue was by far the biggest surprise of the night, delicious. And the goat heart didn't disappoint either. 5 of us shared 10 different plates. The pierogies under impressed but being used to homemade ones in Pittsburgh it's hard to top them. Do yourself a favor, take a group, order a few bottles of wine, and check your inhibitions at the door and you'll have a great time."
"The food was ""ok"" i think it was a little overly hyped. I had the pig face which was good and the confit goat belly but did not like the sauce on it that much."
amazing place....very nice decor...the food is extremely flavorful! They have a unique concept of small plates...which is great as you get to enjoy many items...each item has a unique taste...so you enjoy their individuality. Cocktails were a dampener....both the cocktails were low on alcohol....and it was easy to make out that the other items were more than the alcohol. But that didnt reduce the overall enjoyment. The person serving us was great on customer service...we told her that it was my wife's bday....and when we didnt order any deserts (we were way too full)...she got a complimentary cake/ice cream which was very innovatively done. Overall hugely impressed. This was our first time. Will definitely go again.
"Believe the hype! This place is legitimately one of the best restaurants I have ever been to in Chicago. It was perfect from beginning to end! I started with the ""Best of Three"" cocktail. It tasted and smelled awesome! My group treated the food as a Tapas so I will put down my favorites. I found reading Yelp reviews helped me pick out the right dishes! Pig Face (not as gross as it sounds) Lamb Ribs Sauteed Green Beans Ham Frittes Pan Fried Peppers PotstickersAny of the Desserts! I wasn't a big fan of the fish dishes, but then again I am not a big fish eater! Our server was phenomenal and recommend the perfect amount of food. I also liked that she came off as sincere and not a pretentious hipster. The only real downside I could find was the price. Some things are worth the money, but a $9 Alagash is a little out there! I would rather give this more like 4.5, but I would give it the benefit of the doubt! Believe me, it is that good!"
"This was honestly one of the best meals I've ever had. Â My husband and I visited Chicago for my birthday and he made a reservation at Girl and the Goat. Â We sat at the chef's table looking into the kitchen so it was great to talk to the chefs and get all of their wonderful recommendations. Â We had the wood grilled broccoli, escargot ravioli, pan roasted halibut, pig face, horseradish oysters, goat empanadas, and the plantain cake and budino for dessert.I'm not even that adventurous of an eater (especially with meats) and I can say the pig face and the goat empanadas were two of the best things I've ever had. Â My very favorite was likely the halibut (recently added to the menu). Â If I were to go again I would skip the oysters and the plantain cake (not bad just not as good as everything else we had), but the budino was so amazing! I seriously loved everything I had to eat and our waitress was fantastic. Â Since we were so close to the kitchen we found the chefs to be so engaging - they recommended most of what we ordered and were happy to answer any questions we had (even telling me how to make the delicious broccoli). I really can't say enough good things about our experience at Girl and the Goat!"
"We dined here last night and were impressed. The restaurant is beautifully designed and the service was great. We had the honey sambal brioche, marinated olives, and the grilled pork belly. We loved the bread. The accompanying spread and ""salsa"" was delicious. The olives were good and the portion was huge. The grilled pork belly was okay, but the flavors didn't seem to complement each other. A beautiful place and fun atmosphere!"
"I went here in December for my fiance's birthday. We had an 8:30 reservation for a Monday, his birthday, and the restaurant was full as if it were a Saturday. Â We were still seated immediately. Â Our server was friendly and at our table when we wanted him, and left us alone when we didn't need him. Perfect balance. Â The meal was well-paced and took just under 2 hours. Â The food was good. I can't remember everything we got, but the stand-out dish for me was the lamb ribs. Despite the restaurant being very trendy, not one staff member we interacted with was pretentious, and the price was fairly reasonable for 5 small plates and 3 drinks total.A funny observation about the other patrons: everyone was on their A-game in terms of food snobbery. Â We overheard snippets such as... ""The shiitake in this gelato adds a certain je ne sais quois and really makes the chocolate sing,"" and, ""In my culinary tour of Yemen, I became accustomed to..."" Â It was hilarious, especially because the staff themselves were totally normal and really seemed to create a relaxed, homey vibe."
I am in love with G&G!!! I have been here a few times and it never disappoints. I always thought of it as one of my all time favorite restarants ever but the true challenge is when I took my super foodie friends from NYC! They loved it! =)Here are my tips on what to order:- Pig face. Sounds weird but trust me it is fantastic- Duck thongs. simply delicious- Green beans. who knew that veggies can taste so good- ScallopsI hope you enjoy it!
The food here is absolutely amazing! Worth the wait and the visit!
"They do what they do well. Â The service was nice. Â The drinks were on point. Â The dishes were well balanced and comforting. Â The Pig Face was very good.You could probably sneak in to one of Â the common areas without a reservation if you like being risky or arent too hungry yet.Is it worth all of the hype? Â Kind of. Â Again the food is balanced and comforting, but nothing really made me saw wow. Â Frog legs were the only meh of the night.Thing is I wouldn't really need to go back."
"Get ready for a flavor-explosion-party-in-your-mouth! Â We got lucky and got reservations last minute! Â Make sure you get a reservation ahead of time, like in days.. Â The wait was long, but well worth it. Â Packed with friendly service and great ambiance, a hot place to be to hang out and enjoy! Â We had a great time and our server made it even better! Â We had the following:- Pretzel bread with thousand island sauce; this was awesome, but we had to lay back on the bread to eat what's in store for us!- Roasted Cauliflower: consists of pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint; honestly this was okay, I actually did not want to continue to eat it because it was not that great- Kona Kampachi Crudo: crisp pork belly with chili aioli and caper berries; delicious and great on textures, very light- Diver Scallops: served with XO, pork sausage, shiitake, bok choy, and butternut squash; delicious scallops, but can pass on especially for the delicious meats here!- Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: consists of sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix; OMGee delicious! Â talk about a flavor explosion of delicious and a great contrast of textures, a MUST ORDER!- Crisp Braised Pork Shank: consists of butternut squash-shiitake kimchee, buttermilk dressing and nann; another OMGee! Order this delicious and tender piece of meat thingy, you will not regret it, if you do not like it, just go ahead and ship me the leftovers ;)- Confit Goat Belly: with bourbon butter, lobster and crab, and fennel; Â also very good, how can you say no to goat belly??Ah, I was so, so happy that I got a reservation here last minute, very so happy."
"Much anticipated dinner reservation during a weekend trip to Chicago. Certainly not dissappointed. We had the hamachi, cauliflower, goat belly with lobster and crab, and pork shank. Food was outstanding. -1star: SERVICE... Hostess was welcoming, but waitress was in a rush maybe due to the fact we were a late dinner reservation. She even told us to put all our order in from the first time... Ok.. I did not let that bother my decadent experience with all the mixed flavors we picked. Too bad people's attitude sometimes can damage a restaurant's excellence. Management should keep an eye on this."
Pretty awesome. Â Grilled octopus was perfection! The sauce was beyond heaven. Â Wish this restaurant was in NYC.
"My husband and I had a very nice dinner last night at Girl & the Goat. Â We made an 8:30 pm reservation about a month and a half in advance but arrived around 8 and were seated immediately (the weather was terrible, so they'd probably had some cancellations - if you're looking to walk in without a reservation, go during a snow storm!). Â The servers ""course"" the meal for you - you basically order whatever you want, and they decide in what order you'll be eating. Â I understand the point of that, but as there were some dishes my husband was really interested in and others that I was more interested in, it would have been nice to have a little more control and get more than one dish at once. Â Maybe we could have requested that... but we'd never been before so didn't know how it would work out!We didn't waste any time with bread and instead went for the good stuff:1. Hamachi crudo with crispy pork belly - delicious! Â This was a close second to our favorite dish of the evening. Â The hamachi was very high quality and the pork belly, sauce and other garnishes were just perfect.2. Â Grilled pork belly - awesome!! Â This was our favorite dish of the night; the pork was very thinly sliced and perfectly cooked, and the veggie , blood orange pieces and pesto style sauce served with it were incredible. Â If we went back, I think we'd get at least 2 orders of this!3. Â Pig face - interesting and good. Â Very reminiscent of breakfast - the dish involves shoestring potatoes, the pig face, which is sort of like a pork sausage, and a sunny side up egg on top. Â We observed as the table next to us expertly chopped up the whole mess and mixed it all together, and we followed their lead when ours arrived. Â The flavors worked well together; it wasn't amazing but it was good and quite filling (my third favorite).4. Â Roasted duck breast - this was my husband's third favorite; I thought it was alright but nothing special. Â The preparation involves roasted duck (nice and crispy on the top/outside) in a bowl with some sort of broth, onions, broccoli rabe, other assorted veggies and (I think) chopped up pieces of shrimp. Â I thought it was all just too much - the duck was good though not amazing, but the broth/soup situation wasn't particularly appealing. Â I would skip this for more pork belly!5. Â Roasted cauliflower - this was an accidental delivery to our table; we pointed out the mistake (we'd actually ordered broccoli) but they let us keep it. Â It was ok - cauliflower has never been one of my favorites but as cauliflower goes this was decent. Â It was served with pickled peppers and mint which made kind of a weird flavor combination, but not bad.6. Â Wood grilled broccoli - a good veggie choice in my opinion (one of the few that didn't come slathered with some sort of sauce or other weirdness). Â The broccoli was well cooked and not overdone, flavor was good and blue cheese was a nice touch (I could have done with a little more!).7. Â Braised pork shank - totally underwhelming. Â The presentation is epic and they clearly viewed this as saving the best for last but we were unimpressed. Â The pork had a nice crispy crust, but was seriously lacking in flavor!! Â Two sauces and naan were provided; one sauce was sort of a buffalo sauce and the other was like a very bland buttermilk ranch - we didn't really like either. Â I think the pork was well cooked, tender and juicy inside, etc. but it just had no flavor at all. Â We briefly discussed taking it home and putting the leftovers on buns with BBQ sauce, but decided not to bother. Â The waiter couldn't believe we didn't want to take the leftovers to go (particularly since we only ate about a quarter of it), but it just wasn't worth it. Â As one of the more expensive items on the menu, we really expected better!8. Â Citrus pavlova - the perfect desert! Â Very light, great flavors of blood orange pieces and ice cream, yuzu curd and a hard meringue. Â After a pretty heavy dinner this was just ideal.Overall we had a great meal and it was actually pretty reasonably priced - about $165 with tip for all of the above, plus a coke and one cocktail. Â I'm not sure it was quite worth the hype or the month and a half wait for a reservation, but we'd definitely go again for the hamachi and pork belly, and would like to try some of the other menu items."
"I had the most wonderful experience at this restaurant!! From their wait staff to the ambiance to their delicious food...everything was exceptional! Very reasonable prices for the sharable plates and boy were they tasty!! Also, I experienced this place on my birthday and the desert they gave me was superb!! Just wish I could remember the name of it. Definitely recommend this place to ppl touring Chicago. And if you already live there well...you're just lucky! Great city to be in minus the treacherous winter lol!"
"Impossible to ever get a reservation here so we always just drop in and grab a seat at the bar. Â Sometimes a table will open up and we'll be lucky to get into the dining room...other times we just eat at the bar. Â No matter where, the service and food is always incredible. Â The pig face while at first sounded peculiar after the first bite I was hooked...and they do a fantastic job with vegetables which is great when someone at the table is vegetarian! Â Bread always welcoming and very unique and creative desserts. Â Can't say enough about this place...just one of those restaurants you never get tired of as they're always changing things up."
"I can write a whole novel about this place because I feel like everyone needs to know how great this place is. I think part of the mystery is to just go for it and order what makes you smile! To be honest, everything I ordered was nothing short of extravagant! I did not order a bad plate at that place, so that is why I want to leave it to you to do the ordering. I do have to say that we did get the Budino for dessert and it was absolutely life changing. At least for me it was... the texture, the depth of flavor, and artistic presentation is incomparable. Every time I go back to Chicago, my first reservations I need to make is for this spot! One of the best places I've ever eaten at! I've only said that about one other place!"
"Very fun. Delightfully surprising flavors that all worked. It doesn't sound like much, but I highly, strongly, emphatically recommend the cauliflower dish. Also, the chickpea fritters and the escargot ravioli were favorites at our table. The plates are meant for sharing tapas style, so they recommend ordering 2 dishes per person. That makes for a fun dining experience and lots of variety. The namesake goat Â dishes did not strike me as particularly appealing. We had the goat empanadas. While they were good, the meat inside really could have been anything. The restaurant was quite loud. We sat at the edge, so it wasn't too bad, but I would not have wanted a table in the middle."
"Ambiance of this space is beautiful. It's classy, but not pretentious at all. Here's what we ordered (table of 5) and ranked in chronological order of what we liked best:1) Sweet corn goat cheese wontons - Of the 13 dishes we ordered, this was my favorite and I normally don't even like goat cheese! The mix of the sweet corn, tomatoes and, popcorn (yes! delicious and unexpected) was perfect. 2) Escargot ravioli - the tamarind-miso sauce gives this dish a very rich flavor.3) Roasted cauliflower - in the span of 2 days I had 3 different roasted cauliflower dishes: Purple Pig, Gilt Bar, and here. The cauliflower at Girl & the Goat was definitely my favorite. 4) Kona kampachi crudo Â - dish is small, but the fish was so fresh5) Pig face - it was good, but I can't say it was my favorite dish. We weren't sure how to eat the dish. The waitress told us to mix everything together: ""the messier it looks, the better it will taste!"" Truth. 6) Crisp braised pork shank - fall off the bone delicious. The meat is a great pair with the naan and sauces7) Kalbi beef ribs - very tender and the okra was a nice addition to the plate8) Culture club - we started off with the culture club. The bread (baked in house) was so soft and paired so well with the butter and pickled raisins. 9) Grilled baby octopus 10) Confit goat belly 11) Fried pickles - the shallot aioli and yuzu harissa (2 sauces it came with) tasted odd on its on. Dip the pickles in both sauces at once; they taste better combined. 12) Sugo 13) Diver scallops - dish was still very good, but nothing specialLast note: do not skip out on the miso-butterscotch budino. I came with very high expectations and left incredibly happy. All the dishes here are solid."
"two and half years living and dining in Chicago and this by far the best restaurant in this city. I have also worked in the restaurant industry for nearly a decade and am by nature incredibly critical of everything from food to service to flatware. Girl and the Goat takes the cake, every time. Im totally blown away by a parade of dishes that seem to come straight from heaven topped off by perfect on point service. Bravo."
"Came here on a friend's recommendation. The menu looked unique. Upon first entrance, there's a great energy here. Lots of people. Â Friendly. Fun atmosphere. The back tables near the kitchen are great for large parties. I was solo and sat at the bar. First, Joshua - behind the bar is super friendly and he's a mixologist. There are bartenders that pour drinks and then there's those that mix them. Loved the Bolt Action. Try it. But, then he made me his signature Manhattan. He's got serious game. The lamb tartare was outstanding (Josh's reand a perfect single or to-be shared dish. The roasted beet salad was ok. I was expecting some golden beets and other varieties other than just red. The white anchovies were a good add and not to overpowering, but not my taste.The kusshi oysters are delectable. The Lamb Calamari is one if thee most unique dishes ever. Get it'"
"Amazing. You are well taken care of even if you are a walk in without a reservation. The food and cocktails have great flavors. I recommend the best of three cocktail with grilled octopus and the pork shank. The escargot ravioli was delicious and our dessert, bittersweet chocolate cake was the perfect end to a fantastic meal! Great atmosphere I highly recommend an evening at The Girl and the Goat!!!!"
"All I can say is wow! I had an truly amazing culinary experience at Girl and the Goat last night. My friend and I arrived at about 20 minutes early for our reservation and were immediately seated at the Chef's Table! I've never eaten at a Chef's Table before and eating at the Girl and the Goat's Chef's Table as my first try will definitely be hard to beat... My friend and I decided to try five different menu items and chose to go with the sauteed green beans, wood grilled broccoli, grilled baby octopus, braised pork shank and duck confit. I loved how when we ordered our waiter told us he'd know the best order to bring everything out in, the order he served them totally surprised me but I ended up loving it!All of the food we ordered had so many amazing and unexpected flavors. Highlights were the smoke blued cheese sauce that came with the grilled broccoli, the fish aioli on the green beans, and the amazing acidity of the grilled baby octopus. We were also lucky enough to get two dishes on the house including the empanadas and a chocolate cake dessert served with mushroom ice cream. The empanadas were my favorite dish of the evening and I loved the tzatiki sauce that they were served with.Additionally one of the best parts of the meal was being able to sit at the Chef's Table and talk to the chefs as they prepared our fabulous meal. Finally, the service was fantastic and it only made an already great experience better. It was truly a joy and definitely one of the most unbeatable dining experiences I have had."
"Often times I have found in the past that I'm going to places with fantastic food, but it's either very quiet or I'm under dressed in anything but a suit. Â So when walking in, the vibe was relaxed but ""quality"" was in the air. Â The attitudes of the the hosts and waiters were relaxed but still top notch. Â Even when migrating from the bar area to our table right near the kitchen, our waitress knew my drink when it was low and asked if I wanted another one. Â Just as something was needed...new plates, water, napkin...someone was there to provide it.Now the food itself was also outstanding. Â While I never figured that goat stuffed calamari would be a good combination, it worked perfectly. Â Duck tongues were delish and even the beet salad was great. Â The one thing I would probably pass on ordering would the escargot ravioli. Â It was a great dish but I think I would just go for the escargot on its own without the pasta. Â But that's just getting nit picky.The one negative would be the drink size. Â One of the members of our table ordered the seasonal cider they have and it was poured to about the level or less of a glass of wine. Â Typically cider falls into the ""pour like a beer"" category in my book so that was the one and only downfall."
"Don't get me wrong...everything was very decent. But for the amount of hype behind this place as well as the price, I expected more :("
"The dining experience was excellent, but not perfect. To be fair, it has something to do with personal taste and the order our food was served.Now, in the order of serving:Florida frog legs - a solid 10 out of 10. Crispy outside, tender inside, as good as it gets. Jicama and perilla? A new combination to me but it was so savory.Wood fired scallops - very nicely charred on the outside without hardening the inside. Â The rhubarb bacon was killer and the dish paired well with asparagus. However, the scallops were too salty, which was my major complaint of that evening. With bacon on the top, perhaps no extra salt should be added?Green beans - a recommended dish and I loved it. Fish sauce vinaigrette, cashews and green beans. Simple ingredients do synergize!Pig face - blew me away just like the frog legs. Crispy and kinda melted in my mouth. The potato stix bedding was delicious.Goat liver mousse - well prepared but turned out to be a mistake to order. The liver mousse had a very strong alcohol presence, and wasn't really my taste. It was so rich and heavy that I had to skip dessert afterwards, which bummed me out a little.The service was exceptional. Friendly and helpful waitress, timely refills, and the serving was very well-paced.Will definitely come back to try the other dishes whenever having a chance.Oh, don't forget to pair with wine. Pinot noir should be a safe choice."
"Clearly, Girl & The Goat doesn't need another review, but I feel the need to add my 2 cents anyway, because, why not.We tried for months to get a reservation at a normal time, and were never able to. So finally I had a random Tuesday off of work, we got there at 4:45pm and were seated immediately prior to someone else's 6:15 reservation. Luck was on our side.Everything was delicious. I had a punch-you-in-the-face cocktail (Jack in Detox) and boy, did it. So great. We started with the miso hungry bread plate, which was great. We also ordered the green beans, shrimp, scallops, goat empanadas & pork frites. My favorite dish was the shrimp, but honestly, everything was just amazing. We had a gift card so that helped with the $$$, and I can't wait to go back again."
"Was lucky enough to get a reservation at this highly recommended place! Well it did not disappoint!!! The atmosphere was very vibrant and hip, our waitress Marnie was awesome and the food was exceptional!!! We left our dining experience up to our waitress and every dish was more unique and tasty than the next. Highly recommend if you can get that reservation!"
"At this point a 5 star rating is almost redundant, but I have to update my review for this last dinner experience.This was my fourth time at G&tG and this time we were seated at the Chef's table. Â I didn't even know they had a Chef's table.We had:- roasted beets - beets are so in right now (apparently), and this was an excellent presentation.- chickpea fritters - I know I should try new things, but every time I come here I get this. Â The texture and flavors make this a must have. Â - confit of duck leg - the duck was good, but I loved the bok choy & maitake. Â Maybe it's the Asian in me. Â - goat empanadas - gotta get something made w/ goat here and this is another dish I always get. Â Perfect outer shell, tender goat meat inside, and delicious sauce accompaniment.- not campbell's bread - okay, how do you make bread that soft and melty on the inside? Â I don't even want to think about how much butter goes in there, but it's worth it for every moist and delicious bite. Â The spreads of ""tomato"" and ""mushroom"" soup are also beautifully inventive.- pan fried shishito peppers - this was gift number 1 from the kitchen. Â There were a few peppers in the bunch that had a nice heat to them. Â It was like finding a delicious spicy treat. Â A little heavier than I usually want my vegetables though.- sugo - this was gift number 2 from the kitchen. Â My favorite part was the balance of flavor from the gooseberries. Â The pappardelle was perfectly cooked and the gooseberries nicely balanced out the meat ragout type sauce.- pumpkin pie gelato - ended our night with this dessert number. Â It's not too sweet and the cayenne (I think) gives the sweet a nice kick of spicy. Â It wrapped the night up nicely for us.Whenever I try to explain to someone how much I love G&tG, they always ask, ""what kind of food is it."" Â I have no idea how to describe the flavors, mostly b/c I don't know what half the ingredients are. Â But I have yet to bring a friend here who wasn't impressed.How this is a ""bib gourmand"" and not at least a ""1-star"" Michelin makes me question Michelin's methodology. Â Get it together guys!"
"Do I really need to write a review for this place? Â Wifey made us a reservation for my birthday dinner about a month in advance, since it is hard to get last minute reservations. All I can say is. Â WOW. Â I am not much of a fan of upscale restaurants, they are usually too snobby for my taste, but this place is really down to earth. Â The server was extremely knowledgeable and nice and she crossed off the items on the menu we couldn't eat because of our dietary restrictions. So we basically ordered everything else. Â She said it takes about 5-6 items to satisfy 2 people, and we ordered 6 dishes, an order of oysters and a bread. Â Here I am eating the leftovers for lunch, and damn it was just as good as last night. Â We ordered: Fried Oysters- wowFried Pickles, not the best ive ever had but the pickle itself was awesome.Roasted Cauliflower- Â Heaven on a plateThe grilled shrimp- Â DAMNBeef Tongue- Â This might have been my favorite, wifey hated the idea then I had to pry my share from her clutches. Lamb Ribs- Â mind blown, the sweet and savoriness of this dish is out of this world. Wood Fired Walters Chicken- Â to die for, and the plaintain mash was insane. I cant believe it took us this long to try this place since we moved to chicago a year ago, and thank god it took this long, or else I would have hit this spot monthly."
"Had my birthday dinner here and my goodness was it great! Â Thanks so much Girl and Goat for taking care of me last night and filling me with tons of yummy food. The entree's favor profiles were out of this world. Â Flavors you may never discover unless you visit The Girl and Goat. Â And wait the service, was perfect! Cant wait til next time and looking forward to your spin on Chinese food Stephanie Izard!"
"I was planning a trip to Chicago, and eating here was my #1 priority. I made a reservation as early as OpenTable would allow (100 days in advance). Though it was a good meal, in the end I have to say that for me Girl and the Goat is overrated.These are the dishes we got:Fried picklesPig faceScallopsCauliflowerKalbi ribsSkate wingSquash blossom RangoonThey were all... pretty good. I liked them. Were they what I expected of a place getting national buzz? Not really. Our group was split on opinions of the fried pickles, the pig face was fun (because it's fun to say pig face). The kalbi was fairly fatty and oily - I know these are part of why it's not a prime cut, but the portion we got didn't seem like it was cooked at the level of the rest of our dishes. Â Sorry I don't have more details; on our brief trip to Chicago we ate very well, and I have to say none of the dishes here stuck in my mind in the days afterward.Our waiter was nice and went along with our people-from-out-of-town schtick. However, I think there are some serious issues with their allergy menu philosophy. The gluten-free menu was a version of the regular menu with a bunch of asterisks that basically mean they have gluten in them (took a few trips to the kitchen to figure it out). Might be fine for people with a mild sensitivity, but it's depressing to see a majority of dishes have malt vinegar and soy sauce on a gluten free menu (both are solidly not gluten free). It seems clear they did their gluten free menu as a sop to fad dieters and not to serve people with actual dietary needs, and have not trained the staff on food allergens. On the plus side, the gluten free bread they brought out was good.My expectations my have been unrealistically high. But honestly the next night we went to Farmhouse in River North / Near North and I liked everything about it more than Girl and the Goat (they even have a direct competitor in the above-the-neck pig parts division, a great pig ear dish that beats GatG's pig face hands down). If you're looking for a Top Chef restaurant worth traveling for, Talde in Brooklyn is way better as well. I wish I could have as glowing things to say as everyone else, but sometimes the dream doesn't match the reality."
"I'm pretty sure I could have eaten the entire dish of Shishito Peppers all on my own. In fact, I might have, I'm not sure. I was too busy eating them to notice that a certain someone was sneaking bites of my spare rib. OMG. It was all so good. That being said, Purple Pig and RPM knocked this place out of the top two of food-ventures. That doesn't mean I didn't love Stephanie Izzard's place. It just means I loved the other two that much more. Take it as you will. (For those following along, yes I did gain something close to 10 pounds on this trip alone.)"
Visited for the first time and really enjoyed my meal! Â I brought 4 out of town friends and we all had a great time. Â This is a perfect restaurant for a group - each of us ordered two items as recommended which gave us each 10 dishes to try. Â They were fantastic! Â The prices are also quite reasonable. Â The short rib and the pork shank were the favorites of the group.
"Another incredible visit -- must share the new things I've triedBread bread bread!!!Goat empanadas- small portion, but unrealMussels- so flavorful and super garlicky!!! this stood out as a favoriteCauliflower- greatShort ribs- good but nothing to write home aboutStaples: kohlrabi salad, green beans, shashito peppers Surprisingly did not love or really even like the chicken!"
"The food and ambiance in this place is amazing. The menu is tapa style and very eclectic. We ate things I never thought I would try such as (if you're a vegetarian stop reading) duck tongue and pig face. The braised short ribs are by far the best I have ever had. If you go, definitely order the first bread on the menu (I wasn't crazy about the third one), short ribs, hamachi, peppers, goat empanadas, scallops, duck breast and duck tongue."
Asian influence indeed. Â The duck was moist and green beans were crunchy. Â Bartender was super nice.
"Goat....goat...goat.....Goat....goat...goat.....Goat....goat...goat.....You do not go wrongWell stocked bar.....good service to begin with....had Carpacio..good....Lamb Shank...amazingMet this couple from Toronto, Â great evening"
The best veggie brunch this part of chicago. I will totally recommend this restaurant to anyone who wishes for good medium priced food with amazing drink options.Make the best of the situation and remember to order either the veggie quesadillas or the paranthas burrito.
"After the 2nd visit to Girl & the Goat I am more blown away than the first, both in terms of culinary execution and service. The waiter recommended about 2 plates per person to share which worked out perfectly for our group of 5. Some of my favorite dishes were:1) Roasted Cauliflower - Absolutely the best vegetable dish I have ever eaten! The cauliflower was perfectly charred and seasoned. I went back for 2nds and 3rds. 2) Scallops - Cooked perfectly. The char on top nicely offset the silky meat. Light and satisfying. 3) Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - A must try! I was slightly terrified on my first visit but ordered it because of the great reviews and was not disappointed. The meat has a bacon quality with a sunny side up egg served on top. We ordered it on my 2nd visit as well with a separate group of friends and everyone loved it. 4) Crisp Braised Pork Shank - The presentation had everyone at the table reaching for their phones to take a picture. The meat is fall off the bone tender and it's served with a buttermilk dressing and triangles of naan bread which make it easy to construct mini pork sandwiches. 5) All of the breads - These aren't your ordinary breads and should not be skipped. If you can only pick one I highly recommend the Honey Sambal Brioche. 6) Miso Butterscotch Budino (dessert) - They had me at bacon toffee and sealed the deal with glazed pineapple. I don't know how to describe it other than saying it was a party in my mouth. Great mix of salty and sweet. Not so favorite dishes:1) Pan Fried Shishito Peppers - You get a large bowl which was too much for our group of 5. I ate one or two with some of the meat dishes but in comparison to other options on the menu they didn't have the wow factor. 2) Roasted beets - To be fair I'm not a beet person, but thought if anyone could change my mind it would be Stephanie Izzard. Sadly I'm still anti-beet. However, the person at my table who likes beets loved them and took the rest home. If you're a beet person this is a must order dish. I can't wait for my 3rd visit to continue eating my way through the menu!"
"Undeniably phenomenal. Every bite was an experience. This is a meal you won't regret! Favorites were the beef short ribs, monkfish, and the chocolate cake dessert with shiitake. I want everyone I know and love to experience this place!"
"I was super excited to visit this place from the rave reviews I've heard but found that the experience was just mediocre. I have no complaints about service, everything was good on that front, but the food was just....blah. The octopus was bland and the roasted pig face which was highly suggested was so fatty it's very unsatisfying. The hamachi crudo was my favorite dish we ordered; the flavor combinations were great! Overall, I felt that the ideas were there but the execution was a bit poor. I'm not in any rush to return."
"I was in Chicago and was able to get a late reservation (9:15pm) on Open Table the day of! Â (Previously the earliest available was 10pm). Â The place was packed for a Monday night, and I was actually surprised how large the restaurant was (although the ambience remains vibrant and intimate). Â There's a great bar area as well.While Stephanie herself was not there (apparently she's spending a lot of time at her new diner down the street), the service was awesome -- low key, knowledgeable, and comfortable. Â We had a leisurely, relaxed dinner -- great pacing -- and shocking how fast some of the dishes came out yet we didn't feel rushed at all. Â All the dishes came out super fresh and hot.Some favorites:Goat empanadasFried oystersShishito peppersFried picklesKampachi crudoPig face (not really a pig face, actually not sure what part of the face we ate)Duck tongue!Desserts were also fun and seasonal. Wine and beer list is very extensive and interesting. Â Definitely worth trying to get in!Tami"
"Every single dish that came out was exemplary and struck a beautiful balance between clean, bright flavors with richer, heavier ones but I've got to give special recognition to the goat liver mousse and crumpets; they were to die for! Was also very impressed by the octopus and the squash blossom rangoon. Service was fantastic to boot. Can't recommend this place enough!"
"First The Girl: Lindsay, our fantastic server ROCKS!Next, the ambiance: sit outside for the best experience(The inside noise level is deafening) 3rd: the food: if you can be ""in love"" with a vegetable, then I want to marry the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts and mint, it's that good folks!Last but not least, the beet salad is unBEETable.This place does everything right...treat yourself!"
"Amazing!!!! Me and hubby's favorite spot in Chicago. The food, ambience and drinks are unreal. Highly reccommended. My faves are the pork shank, chick pea fritters, grilled broccoli.....actually anything you order will be great. I cannot wait to back again and again."
"Fantastic meal! Â Great beer and wine selection. The scallops, pig face (with egg), and goat belly were superb. Â The noise level seemed a bit too high for my tastes, but will it not stop me from returning. The staff was pleasant and helpful.I look forward to returning."
"After hearing so much about this place, we had to check it out. It was really good. The hubs and I shared everything. The only bad thing is the seats, they were not comfortable at all.The best part of the meal was the dessert- and I'm a dessert snob! Definitely one I recommend!"
"Just...wow. Had the best experience here last night!The hubby and I decided to try our luck at GG without reservations. Got there at about 715, and our expected wait time for a table was 45 minutes. We went to the bar and were immediately able to find two seats. The bartender was attentive and made me a delicious champagne cocktail! My favorite! Our table was ready after 20 minutes- score. Started with the tortena bread, good, but nothing mind blowing.The pig face and lamb ribs- OMG. Literally the best things I've eaten ever. I'm not an adventurous eater, so was nervous about it, but Get them. You won't be disappointed. If you have to choose, pig face is better lamb rib. But hopefully you can get both. Hubby is a vegetarian- he got the spring rolls, roasted cauliflower, and chickpea fritters. Good, but nothing amazing. I would get the cauliflower again. Long story short, get the meat here! I'm drooling thinking about it. Service is great, ambiance is trendy/romantic, food is excellent. Burned a small hole in the wallet but totally worth it!"
This was my birthday dinner choice... it was amazing. I highly recommend the goat neck. I was a little nervous but it was the best
Great food! Â The roasted cauliflower is a MUST order!
"Fell in love with this place before I gave up animal products, and I am happy to say that it still woos me. I did some research before returning and found out that they have a separate menu of their veganized food which was surprisingly long and varied compared to most places I frequent. The service was amazing and attentive. I was impressed (and flattered) when my friends ordered a veggie dish to share (with cheese) and our server returned to the table with a dairy-free version for me at no additional cost. My friends enjoyed everything they ordered and I loved my dishes as well. I tried the roasted cauliflower, roasted beets, and pan-fried shishito peppers. The latter being my absolute favorite. I'd take a star off for their outrageously priced cocktails if only they weren't so damn delicious - ""Thai One On"" was my guilty pleasure concoction. The only other downfall was that I didn't have any dessert options."
"Called two weeks in advance from LA as I was planning my trip to Chicago and easily got a reservation. I'm not sure if this was pure luck because I've seen the reviews about calling for reservations months in advance. My friend and I arrived about 15 minutes early and our table was ready and we were seated without any delay. I also had my baby and they were kind enough to seat us away from the bar, which is one of the loudest areas in the restaurant. Our server, Kelly, was absolutely fantastic. Her energy and excitement about the menu made us that much more excited. She suggested four plates between the 2 of us, but we picked seven. I figured I'm not in Chicago every day and really wanted to try all of the popular items. The menu is divided into three sections - vegetables, fish, and meat. We selected the sauteed green beans and the wood roasted broccoli from the vegetables section. Because we were ordering so many items, Kelly suggested half orders of the vegetable dishes (this option isn't listed on the menu), and those were perfect sizes. The green beans were to die for. The combination of the fish sauce vinaigrette and the cashews and the green beans was amazing! This is a dish I can totally see myself craving and wanting to go back for. Yum. Skip the broccoli. Both of us like broccoli and blue cheese, and neither of us were satisfied with this one.From the fish section, we ordered the wood fired scallops and the grilled baby octopus. The scallops were cooked well and not overdone as they tend to be in so many restaurants. The grilled baby octopus was more for my friend, but I had a few bites and liked it. But, on to the stars of the night... the meat plates!So we had to try the famous roasted pig face, and we also ordered the crisp braised pork shank, and the confit goat belly. We had initially chosen the goat ribs over the goat belly, but sadly they had run out. OMG, the pork face! They recommend breaking the sunny side egg on top and mixing it well with the rest of the dish. Every bite is crispy and gooey at the same time and it's heaven! The pork is crispy on the outside, but it somehow melts in your mouth and has the perfect amount of fat to make this dish so rich. Get it! The pork shank was fall-off-the-bone tender. This is a larger sized plate, so it is incredibly filling. It was served with fresh-baked Naan which was delicious, Â but two sauces that I did not feel paired well. There was a buttermilk ranch and a hot sauce, neither of which I felt enhanced the meat, but my friend felt differently. The confit goat belly was seriously like dessert. I was tasting vanilla mixed in with my meat and lobster chunks. It was a very unique dish.We both agreed that our favorites for the night were the green beans and the pig face!We had no room left over for dessert at this point, but we both left hugely satisfied. We had a great meal and a really wonderful server, and I can totally see why this place is such a hit in Chicago!"
Girl and the Goat was as good as all the reviews I had read!!! Â Roasted pig face was delicious and the cocktails were awesome too!!
"Seems like overkill to write a glowing review for a restaurant that has so many of them so I'll keep it short and sweet.The place has a great vibe. A big space that feels intimate. The food is outstanding. Each dish better than the next. The cocktails inventive and the deserts were insanely good.Wait staff was attentive and since one of our friends had a nut allergy, they were careful to point out any dishes that had nuts and let our friend know if they were the kind she was allergic to. Nice touch. Food was excellently paced as it's the kinda place where you order small plates to share. Be careful if you go hungry as it's all soooo good and you'll over order. My advice is start small (6 dishes for 4 people would have sufficed. I think we got 8 or 9.)So is it worth the hype? Yup. I'm no foodie but it's the best meal I've had in ages. Hands down. With tax, tip, drinks, food and desert we spent $140 per couple. I've spent the same or more for food not nearly as good so while it's a splurge, you won't be disappointed."
"Yuck! Not impressed!What's all the hype for? We've had better eclectic food at the Purple Pig. My husband and I tried a few dishes. A couple things that were just okay: oysters, crab. The beef tips were flavorful, but mostly bone. The two thirds of the duck breast that were cooked thoroughly were flavorful, but seeing that we didn't want to spend the night in the hospital for salmonella poisoning we opted not the eat the center portion.We dropped a lot of money for this food and the sad part is we left hungry.We do not recommend this restaurant to anyone!"
This is what every restaurant strives to be. I've been here 4 times and I have enjoyed every single thing. It's one of those restaurants that can change your outlook on certain foods. I have never liked green beans but the green beans at Girl & the Goat are one of my favorite foods. Â Duck tongue? Octopus? All amazing. I would say the only drawback is that everything sounds so good you'll probably end up spending a lot.
"Food here is obviously amazing, goes without saying. What I didn't realize is it is American food with an Asian twist, which I don't actually like but my fiance loves, and how perfect as the dinner was his birthday gift. I called an hour and a half before our reservation and told them it was his birthday. When we were seated (which was 15 minutes late but that's OK) the hostess said happy birthday; our waitress said happy birthday; and a server brought over a piece of cake and said happy birthday. Great customer service. Usually in a restaurant this packed the service is lacking and there aren't enough staff but I thought the ratio of staff to customers was perfect."
"Believe the hype...really believe it. Â We ordered 5 courses and 3 desserts (yum) and each one of them was special with flavors that popped and combinations that we never had before.1. Â Goat empanadas 5/5 - while the goat isn't the star of this dish the dish is still tremendous. Â Tasted like a twist on a gyro with incredibly barely cooked corn that popped in your mouth. Â highly recommended!2. Â Ham Frites - 5/5 - SO GOOD. Â crisp fries with ""ham"" powder on top instead of salt with cheese and aioli dipping sauces. Â 3. Â Grilled baby octopus - 6/5 - probably the best dish of the night. Â So complex and with flavors we never expected. Â It had pistachios and brussel sprouts and grilled baby octopus in a lemony sauce. Â Never expected the baby octopus to be so tender but it was. Â 4. Â Pig Face - 5/5 - perfect breakfast dish. Â lovely sunny side up egg on top of some kind of pork (my wife was scared there was a snout hiding underneath but she ate it anyway) with a tamarind sauce. Â The sweet/sour sauce with rich pork and drippy yolk were a perfect combo.5. Â Lamb Ribs - 5/5 - very good. Â Paired with pickled onions and smoked potatoes. Â My wife doesn't eat lamb normally but she ate this one. Â So very good...one nitpick here though is we wish the fat was rendered a bit more...a bit too much fat on the bone.Dessert1. Â Shitake mushroom chocolate cake - 4/5 - weird but good Â the shitake caramel was confusing and my wife didn't care for it. Â I get the combo with the dark chocolate but the shitake didn't add much to the party2. Â PBJ - can't find it on the menu, it had brioche donuts, peanut dust and concord grape granita i think. Â Very good...4/53. Â Budino - some kind of caramel custard with bacon toffee so goodTIP - you need to have a reservation, we arrived at 945 and it was packed till it closed at 11pm. Â The good thing is that cabs wait out front since this is a very happening spot and you won't have an issue getting a cab on the way home.Awesome. Â We will be back!"
"Ask any one of my friends and they'll tell you that Girl & the Goat is one of my top three favorite restaurants in Chicago. What is a vegetarian thinking making that kind of claim? With such an extensive selection of vegetables that are hearty enough to complete a meal, it's not that far-fetched. I have no shame for my frequent shishito pepper cravings and often convince friends to make the trek down Randolph to satisfy this. I miss the Jonny Appleseed bread and hope it'll make a return soon. In the meantime, I'll just live in my state of cauliflower/shishito pepper/apple buckle bliss."
"For my weekend trip to Chicago, I was desperate to eat the best of what the city has to offer. I tried making a reservation one month in advance, only to realize that it was already fully booked, except for the 11 PM time slot. Seeing as I'm typically sound asleep by then, we decided to just try our luck at 4 PM on a Friday. It was raining, and the hostess graciously let us wait inside before their official opening time. Before I knew it, my name was called, and I felt like I had won the lottery. We were seated at a communal table facing the kitchen, which I appreciated because we could see our dishes being prepared. The space was dimly lit, which makes it difficult to take any food pictures, but creates an intimate atmosphere. We ordered the green beans, goat belly, and pig face. The green beans dish was HUGE. It had a strong Asian influence to it, maybe fish sauce? The two of us barely finished half of this dish, and I definitely tried, since I needed my daily serving of veggies. My boyfriend asked me if we should offer some to our table companions, but I thought that might be creepy, so we refrained. The goat belly was one of their specials that night. I was worried that it would be too heavy, but it was surprisingly refreshing, and didn't taste fatty at all. The star of the show was the pig face (which our waitress assured us would not look like an actual face- phew). It was served on a bed of crispy potatoes, topped off with a fried egg and a mysterious green sauce. We were told to chop it all up, mix it together, and get a little bit of everything in each bite. Â I know this dish has been raved about plenty, but OH MY GOD I can't even begin to explain the flavor explosion that took place in my mouth. The pork was melt-in-your-mouth tender, and combined with the runny yolk and the texture of the potatoes, reached absolute perfection. There's this scene from Ratatouille where the grumpy food critic takes a bite of ratatouille and is immediately taken back to his childhood memories. Strangely enough, I was reminded fondly of my mom's Chinese braised pork dish.There was no way we were passing up on dessert. Our server recommended the miso butterscotch budino with no hesitation. It was layered with cashew cake, bacon toffee, miso butterscotch pudding, pineapples, and whipped cream. The pudding was at the bottom, which I didn't realize until after a couple bites in, but it elevated the dessert from great to phenomenal. Food, service, and atmosphere were on point. I'd absolutely return for more, with reservations 2 months in advance ;)"
I've been back and this place doesn't get old. Love that it is super casual but food is still some of the best. You will feel stuffed and somewhat uncomfortable if you do this place right. Try new things! Go crazy!
"To quote my waiter tonight, She's either mad or a genius! Well awesome waiter (Brennan was totally great as was his trainee), Stephanie Izard is an evil culinary genius....minus the evil part! They don't let just anyone win Top Chef.It's been a year since my last review so thought it was time for an update! The pig face remains my favorite dish at Girl & The Goat. Do not skip this when you go! Topped with a sunny side up egg & other yummies, this dish is mouthwatering and every bite is out of this world.Tonight I tried the bloody mary bread which I'd never had before and it did not disappoint. They bake their bread perfectly with every bite being so soft with scrumptious worcestershire butter to top it off. You must get one of their breads when you go! They always offer three choices for $4 Â - ever changing flavors, and those ever changing flavors are so unique. I also tried the sugo tonight which I had never had before. Personally I'm not into the gooseberries but sans that touch this dish was delicious!We shared five dishes + bread between the two of us tonight and left completely stuffed beyond belief. Note to self for next time: Four dishes + bread will suffice---- it's just so hard to pick between trying new things and sticking with my tried & true favorites. Our bill including tax & tip was $52 each, not bad at all for a fantastic meal!Girl & The Goat remains not only a Chicago hot spot but a top culinary destination for amazing food and service. I recommend it to all tourists and people who live in our fantastic Chi City who haven't gone yet...What chu' thinkin!? Get there now!"
"Returned again.... Been here several times now and always solid. Â Couple of items left the menu I miss... stuffed calamari. Â The trick to getting in is to skip reservations and just do a walk in during the week a bit early. Â If you can arrive at 5:45 you stand a good chance of a walk in as long as you make it clear you will not linger after dinner. Â I have done this maybe 3 times now where we arrive early Tue-Thurs and grab a table at 5:30-5:45 and they basically let us know we need to be out by about 7:15 as the reservations start coming in. Â Also party of two makes it easier, I have not tried the walk in with 4 or more but suspect that may be more difficult. Â Forget about any walk in on Fri or Sat unless you happen to be walking by and want to see if anyone bailed on their reservation."
"There is only one way to eat at Girl & The Goat.Read the menu, hand it back to the waitress, and say yes."
good pig face; i'd get again. chickpea was only okay. goat belly was average. lobster was okay.
"I had originally bought my 2003 Echo from Oakbrook Toyota back in 2003 as a new vehicle and had all of my oil changes, everything done at this dealership through the 12 years I owned the vehicle. Â I was happy then and I was sure I would be happy again. Â I wouldn't go anyplace other than Oakbrook Toyota. Â I stopped by on July 2, 2015 to just look at new vehicles. Â Mustafa greeted me as the sales consultant and I explained that Anita Gomez has spoken with me on the phone and then he had Anita introduce us. Â Syed Mustafa couldn't have been a better sales person. Â He was kind, explained the difference between vehicles, and suggested one which he felt would be a perfect match for me. Â However, it was not in the color I was interested in. Â He approached Alex Syed the General Manager who stated that they had just gotten in new vehicles which were not on the lot and that he would get that one brought up for me to test drive. Â I did and I was hooked on the Toyota Camry SLE. Â It was everything I wanted and I loved the feel of the drive in that vehicle. Â Especially since I was trading in my 2003 Echo. Â I Quite a change. Â Mustafa then introduced me to Steve Niechcielski, Business Manager, who took me through all of the paperwork and was also very kind and funny as well. Â I was able to get my car with a $500 and a $750 special cash toward purchase as well as a wonderful trade-in value for my Echo. Â I also wanted heated seats as well as a remote start and Mustafa told me that wouldn't be a problem to have installed on the car either. Â I drove my new car off the lot that very night and brought it back on Monday, July 7th to have the heated seats and remote start put into the vehicle. Â I got a free loaner car and then picked up my car again on Monday July 8th. Â I couldn't have been happier. Â I will be going to Oakbrook Toyota for everything I need to have done to the car in the future. Â Thank you Oakbrook Toyota for the excellent sales staff you have working for you."
Absolutely a cluster dealing with their reservation policy. Wanted to take a friend out to celebrate their birthday. Arrived at 7 for drinks. Had a 8:30 reservation and was not seated until 9:15. Â No wait staff even approached taking our order. Walked out after 2 and 1/2 hours. Btw: a first for me in 40 years. Â Major Suckage.
"Was surprised by the size of the dishes. While they recommend 2-3 plates per person, I felt like 1-2 was sufficient or there's no room for dessert! We ordered the zucchini bread with hummus and olive butter which was amazing. Fresh bread always makes me happy but the condiments were quite interesting and tasty! The beet salad was good but wasn't that memorable in my opinion. I felt it had too much acid. The goat liver mousse was divine! The muffins that were served with it along with the watermelon pine nuts, jam and pickles complimented the mousse quite well. The pig face, sugo and braised beef tongue were amazing. Each so special on their own. Definitely will return!"
Green beans. Delish! Cauliflower Â  - the the best ever Beet salad. Â Well balanced and yummy. Â  Fried pickles. Â  Small bites. Â Great sauces. Â Bread of the day. Â Yum yum Ham frites. Â A fave. Â Duck tongue. Â DO IT! Falafel. Â OMG. Â Skate wing. Â Smallest portion. Squash blossom. Â Creamy goodness. Â Corn kulfi. Â Great flavors. Â Could have 3! Budino (bacon) dessert. Â Creamy. Â Can't taste bacon. Â Every. Â  Single. Dish. was absolutely absolutely delicious. Â  We were dining w a chef friend who also had only positives and not a single issue. Â Fast and hot. Â Perfectly seasoned. Â This was all our 5th time here. Â Never does this place disappoint. Â  With drinks our bill was 160 for the 4 of us. Portions were great. Â Will be back!!!
"Incredible entrees, with combinations you would never imagine. It is a definitely one of the better places to eat in Chicago."
"I was really excited to try this place but was a bit disappointed. The drinks were good but most of the dishes were only OK. The pork belly was hard and chewy, not melt-in-your mouth. The goat heart was very chewy and mostly tasted like the sauce. The shisito peppers were nothing special. Maybe our expect ions were too high but nothing wow-ed us. Service was fast and friendly."
"I pretty much wanted to eat everything on this menu. Peter Piper: Bread with fennel butter and chili cream cheese. I could eat this all day.Squash blossom rangoon: I've had better squash blossoms, these were a bit limp. but that chive yogurt was wonderful!Diver scallops: They served the goat on the side since my companion doesn't eat land meat. How accommodating of them. And they were delicious.Shishito peppers: With sesame. So good.Caulifower: This was something everyone told me I needed to order. It was good but it's just like my family makes it (ie: easy). If you're Sicilian, you know what it tastes like already and it's skippable. If you grew up thinking cauliflower is only served boiled, then do try it.Chickpea fritters: These were sort of strange and soft, like silken tofu with a tempura crust. Not what I expected. They were okay, the accompanying caponata made it worth ordering. Frankly I thought their drinks were overpriced and just ok. The bartenders were really awesome though, very efficient and PATIENT because let me tell you, eating at that bar is kind of a zoo."
"My ex-boss (that's a thing, right??) gave me a gift certificate so we decided to check this place out and see if the three month reservation wait was worth it.The short of it: worth the time it takes to get a table! Skip the scallops, don't skip the bread.The long of it: bacon and Gouda bread was freaking amazing! Would you judge me if I said it was nearly the best part of the meal?Smoked broccoli was delicious-- just when you think the smokey flavor is going to become overwhelming, you get a nice sweet bite of blue cheese.Stuffed calamari: well done. Nice flavors and textures!Scallops: super salty and actually kind of gross. They were well cooked and the texture was perfect, but the scallops themselves had a gross salty flavor. The asparagus with this dish was perfectly cooked - I wished this dish had had more asparagus.Goat ribs: they were out of goat loin, we were sad. The waitress said they had goat ribs as a substitution -- sold! Nice flavor, very, very tender! Very happy boyfriend.Side note: when your waitress tells you that you've ordered too much food-- trust her judgement, don't do what we did and tell her that you're ready for a challenge. It just ends in epic thanksgiving level fullness!"
"Ahhhhhhmazing (if you get a reservation). The service was great, the atmosphere is trendy, and the food is brilliant. This place gives you the fine dining experience without the fine dining price!! My absolute favorite was the escargot ravioli! Holy cow was it good!"
"After hearing all my friends praise this eatery, I finally had the chance to experience it for myself. My wonderful Wife treated me for my Birthday. And what a wonderful treat it was.  This restaurant is beautiful. The modern decor is easy on the eyes. And the service was top notch. Our server was not only prompt and attentive, he was a lot of fun. Its always a pleasure to dine at an establishment where the staff enjoys their work.  The food experience was what I like to call the tale of two dishes. We started out with the fried pickle appetizer. It was good, but I can't say it was anything to write home about. But no worries, the entree easily made up for it.  For my entree, I ordered the roasted pig face. With a name like that, how can you not order it? Pig face sounds like a villain in a Batman movie. This delightful dish of Swine was one of the best things I've ever eaten. It was a combination of cheek, jowls and chin served with potato sticks with a fried egg on top. This combination of flavor just explode in your mouth. It was a entree to remember.  I'm also going to reveal a little secret for all of you who still haven't tried this fabulous eatery. Its affordable. I would guess based on our bill, the average food tab (without booze) is $30.00 per person. Its one hell of a bargain.  Here is the delicious bottom line on Girl & the Goat: If you haven't tried this place yet, your an idiot. Its one of the best dining experiences in town. And it won't dent your wallet. You may have to wait a few months after booking your reservation, but its well worth it. Stephanie Izard, you have a new fan."
"We made our reservation about 2-3 months in advance. It's a cute place...gets pretty noisy even at 10pm.We started off with their freshly baked bread, mushroom soup butter & tomato sauce dip, and a bacon butter. I really liked the mushroom soup butter. The razor clams were flavorful but only came 3 in an order. The escargot ravioli was nothing special. I'd rather have escargot without the pasta. Â The white fish was in a creamier sauce. It was nice and crispy on the outside and flakey on the inside. The sugo was ok. It did come with a good portion of meat though. Â Confit goat belly was good. The smoked wings had a nice smokey flavor, but I wouldn't recommend getting it here when you have all the other foods to try. Â The pig face, which everyone recommends, was delicious. The crispiness of the pork was perfect. The braised pork shank was a sizeable portion and was very flavorful as well.I already made a second reservation for this restaurant and will be back here this weekend!"
"It's one of those places that's on most of my friends' must-visit list, and I do want to see them, so I've ended up here many times over the last couple years. Â The food's been consistently good, and I do have a fav dish, so I'm ok returning. Â Once we did a walk-in and got a table right away, but we've mostly sat at the bar, and that's been much more enjoyable for me. Â It's a casual and comfortable environment, everyone's been very friendly.The menu changes often, but the goat menu is pretty consistent. Â The empanadas are tasty, the beet salad is great, soft shell crab, roasted cauliflower, etc. Â Have liked everything there, but my hands-down favorite is the goat liver mousse which I get every visit. Â That's a whole entire meal, since no-one ever wants to try it, and I get it ALL to myself. Â Those pillow-soft crumpets are sooo delicious. Â The plates are a decent enough size that 2 or 3 people can get a good taste."
"Really great dinner. Â Good beer list, nice selection of cocktails, and wines. Â Ruby dont lie to me was great cocktail. Â Ordered lots of food. Â Highlights were the pierogies, goat empanadas, skate cheeks with mushrooms, pork shank, and pig face. Â Dessert was ok, apple crumble was a little boring and chocolate brownie with porcini and caramel ice cream was good, would have been better if plates were hot!, so ice cream melted!"
Simply incredible. Great food and the bartenders were awesome. Â Had the goat heart and the shank and they were both amazing. Â Definitely recommend
"VFM, baby!!! All day, Er'day! (A girl can only wish...)We took our chances and walked in at opening on a Saturday and immediately nabbed seats by the bar. BLOODY MARY BREADThe cocktail-turned-fluffy loaf was surprisingly on-point and spiced with accompanying pickles. Mmmm, I love me some good pickles before a meal.CAULIFLOWERHighly recommended by our server, and of course we had to oblige. It was only okay, our veggies were drowned in a pool of oil, Â 'twas too greasy for me.CONFIT GOAT BELLYGet in ma bellay, goat! Luscious! I could've eaten just goat belly for the rest of the night; however the fennel with the crab and lobster was best described as biazarre and off-tasting.DIVER SCALLOPA tribute to seasonal vegetation. Scallop was prepared perfectly with nice cuts of pluots/plums, hierloom varieties plus bok choy. One of my favorites!PIG FACE('D) [pig * feyst](verb) To gorge oneself on indulgent G&G piggy parts with potato stix and flavorful sauces. Used in a sentence: Â ""Man, it was a bad day-- let's go get pig face'd"" It's one of those dishes that make you forget about all of your troubles and then some.MAMA'S ZUCCHINI CAKEWe had enough room for dessert and picked the most intriguing thing on the menu. I don't like desserts that are overly rich. Great way to end the meal as it was light, soft, with just enough sweetness. Mama liked!Time yourself for opening, cross your fingers and hopefully nab those impromptu seats. Get pig face'd with a bunch of other fixings on the menu. ""Cause honestly, how can you decide?"
Amazing food and stuff
"After having been to Little Goat and being a ... wait for it .... little disappointed, my expectations for Big Goat and Girl weren't high. And that was a good thing.My wife and I came here on a whim Saturday evening (that's a stretch) at 5 p.m. I knew they had one or two tables reserved for walk-ins (reserved... for... walk-ins? Whatever.) so we took our chances. Chances were not taken, however, because we got a spot at the bar for two right when we walked in. I don't usually dine at the bar because it can be cramped, but my wife sat next to a huge wooden pillar so that meant only my side was met with another tush. The major pro of eating at the bar was the quick, attentive and lovely service. We never had to wait for anyone to come to our table, take our drink order, leave, come back, etc. It was brilliant! Loved it! Might even do it again!!!The food lived up to every standard I heard of G&TG. Except one dish... the roasted cauliflower. Seriously. How can roasted cauliflower be so freaking DELICIOUS??!! It's a bulbous bland bunch of white.... that exploded with flavor bite after bite. Other standouts included the octopus (so tender!), corny bread and empanadas. The skate wing was in a too-rich-for-my-blood cream sauce, but wifey loved it. The only downfall for her, though, was the SURPRISE! chili flakes nestled between some bites... being that she doesn't do spice, it was an assault on those tender taste buds, so some time had to pass before she could resume the good chow.I definitely recommend Girl & The Goat. And while we didn't have ANY goat, or any beef... pork... meat-things, it was a fantastic experience. And vegans - fyi, they have a vegan menu if you ask! For the two of us with 5 small plates, dessert, two beers and one glass of wine it came out to $50/each. I think that's a damn good price for one of America's most-talked about restaurants. Oh, and ps: It's really pretty inside."
"I had many spectacular meals in the four days I was in Chicago and I have to say that this was my favorite. A friend and I went after The Aviary which is a convenient walking distance away. We ordered a crap-load of dishes and they were all super tasty. My personal favorites were the skate wings, scallops and pig face. The atmosphere here is very fun and I enjoyed all the music they played too. Service was spot on. This was a hard act to follow even though we had reservation for Alinea the next day.Pro Tip: make reservations early, come hungry, spend lots of money, leave happy. Oh, dishes are definitely on the salty side."
"I heard so many good things about the Girl and the Goat, so coming here for the first time was a HUGE deal for me! With that said.... I really need to not get overhyped about restaurants. BUT, the Girl and the Goat took me by surprise with each dish :]1. Goat Blue Bread with fig butter and fennel onion jam ($4): You might be thinking... who pays for bread? But it was really interesting freshly made bread that was kind of similar to foccacia but was topped with cheese and onions through it. When slightly salty bread eaten with both the sweet fig butter and fennel jam, it sounds like a peculiar combination but the textures and flavors blended beautifully together. 2. Ham Frites ($7): Least favorite :/ I am a French Fry Fanatic (Triple F) I like trying fries everywhere. But the very thin fries here were completely OVERFRIED- to the point where fries become translucent because it's so drenched with oil. To top it off (literally), the fries were sprinkled with this grainy, powder-like version of ham (kind of like pulverized bacon). It was SO salty, we couldn't finish it. 3. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face ($16): FAVORITE - there is a reason why there are so many reviews for the pig face - in the dish, there is a pig face, crispy potato stix, with tamarind and cilantro topped with the sunny side egg. Everything needs to be mixed up and eaten in one bite... and WOW Absolutely heavenly and perfection in your mouth. I could eat like 3 of these myself. forreals :}4. Crisp Braised Pork Shank ($25): This is one of their bigger portions of the meal which was a very tender, meat-falling-off-bone shank, that came with a slight sweet/spicy butternut squash-shittake kimchee, creamy buttermilk dressing, and hot puffy naan. There was an array of flavors and textures that just played together quite well. By this point, we were tooo full but it was still nice to try. 5. Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster/crab, and fennel ($19): Confit means that the meat is fried in its own fat. So.... Of course, that sounds appetizing! Ah, I dont even know how to start describing this one. It had the most INTERESTING combination of sweetness from the lobster/crab, with the tang from the fennel and herbs. It was the most ""fresh-tasting"" savory dessert I've ever had. Definitely a must-try! General comments:Cons: Price and Parking - Most of the dishes were quite salty... some more bearable than others. I would definitely want to try other dishes but coming here our meal for 2 came out to ~$90 with tax and tip. Price is always an issue but eating fancy only happens every once in a while! The atmosphere was very dark and loud so I could barely hear anything besides myself. Pros: Our waitress was very attentive and stopped by often. I had a very pleasant experience with the food, service, and presentation. Apparently food is delivered in the order that is most ""suitable"" for your palate. Overall, the food was goood! If I came back, I would only reorder Pig face again. Maybe I'll come back in a few years when I have funds for this extravagant dinner :]"
"It was perfect. I'd say top 5 dining experiences of my life.After months of prowling opentable, I secured a late Thursday night dinner, 9:30pm, and the place was PACKED... and stayed packed well past closing time too. We were graciously seated at the chef's table.. or as close to it as we were gonna get. Our waiter was lovely, as was the friendly grillmaster who managed to chat us up while cooking up a storm. I am so deeply sad I am terrible with names... because they were truly wonderful.We ordered the whitefish, goat belly, pig face, beef tongue. Also received complimentary oysters, cauliflower, and cake!! Everything was like ""oh wow.. this is.. how in the world did they.. this is so freaking amazing"" good. I don't think you can really go wrong with ANYTHING on the ever-evolving menu. Everything was so different, and our waiter was knowledgeable and thoughtful enough to sequence it alternating the rich/heavy with the light/fresh dishes. Only regret is that they'd run out of goat ribs right before we ordered, and we weren't able to fit more in our bellies!Thank you, thank you, thank you, Girl & The Goat for a seriously wonderful and memorable night."
"Lived up to the hype. Â Our waitress, Emily, was one of the best I've ever had. Â Really friendly, great recommendations, kept the flow of the dishes perfect (which can be hard when you have 13 family style dishes coming out).Highlights for me were the Escargot Ravioli, the Pig Face, the Green Beans, amongst others. Â For what it's worth, we ate at Alinea the night before and all agreed that the food at Girl and the Goat was hands down better."
"Shishito peppers were mild and delicious. Forget using a fork, just grab the stems with your fingers and nibble the peppers off. The wood fired conway cup oysters were the perfect starter. The Confit Goat Belly (special) had a nice sauce made with bourbon butter and morsels of lobster and crab, topped with ribbons of fennel. Charred pork belly had an intense rich sauce and would've been terrific with a bowl of white rice. Had to try the pig face because of the previous reviews. I rank that fifth out of five. The bread for starters was crusty and soft on the inside, with a slight sourdough taste. Perfect for two. Go with the intention of sharing dishes because its more fun and you get to try a greater variety."
"Loved it. Â Didn't have reservations so decided to go before dinner opening and got seated quickly. Â Everything we had was delicious. Â From the pork shank, green beans and duck tongue. Â Def worth going"
"Yes! Â Finally went, and it totally lived up to the hype. Â Open Table reservations for Girl & the Goat open up three months in advance, so I'd recommend searching for a date as soon as it opens. Â I was able to get a decent time for dinner on a Friday night by booking three months out. Â The meal is definitely an experience, so plan to hang around for a few hours.Service: Â Our server was wonderful. Â We asked her a million questions, and she was very patient with us. Â I like when you can ask the server her opinion and she doesn't just tell you to get the most expensive item on the menu.Food: Â Amazing! Â If you are not usually an adventurous eater, this is the place to step out of your comfort zone and try something new. Â The dishes are on the smaller side and designed for you to order a few to share. Â For the two of us, we ordered the green bean casserole bread for starters, 4 dishes, and dessert. Â I thought it was the perfect amount. Â My two favorite dishes were the goat empanadas (if you've never had goat, try it!) and the beef short rib. Â The short rib was not at all what I expected, but it was a pleasant surprise. Â The pieces of beef were off the bone, tender on the inside, and crispy on the outside."
"Where do I begin? I guess it's best to begin at the beginning.I love Top Chef and I think Stephanie is totally rad. When my family decided to visit Chicago for the first time, the LITERAL first thing I did was to go onto Open Table and do trial and error until I figured out how many days in advance I would need to book my Girl & the Goat reservation. (It's 100 days, btw.) I then set up a reminder on my calendar to make sure I secured a reservation for the weekend we would be there.Fast forward to the night of my reservation. We arrive at G&tG about twenty minutes early. My family all orders drinks at the bar which were quite enjoyable. We're seated at our table on time and all seems to be going splendidly. We get our menus and I make sure to talk to my server immediately, since I can't eat gluten (I have celiac.). They happen to have a gluten free menu, which was a delightful surprise!And then, it all went downhill. The gluten free menu had gluten on it. I'm not kidding. There was an asterisk indicating items with soy sauce in them. Soy sauce has gluten in it. I double checked with the waiter to clarify what the menu meant (I thought that they must mean tamari, since why would gluten-filled soy sauce be on a GF menu???) and he checked with the kitchen. Those items do indeed have dark soy sauce with gluten in them...""So WHY are they on the gluten free menu?"" I asked him. His response was that if I wanted to be safe then I just shouldn't eat them - no explanation as to why they were on my menu... It was clear that our server had never been trained on food allergies and what is safe/unsafe for customers with various issues. Restaurants that have gluten free menus but whose staff know nothing about gluten make me very, very nervous. So eliminating all the of the notated dishes on the GF menu left me with approximately 3 dishes that were safe to eat... To be honest, the best part of my whole meal was goat cheese butter spread that came with my loaf of GF bread. Our group of 6 ordered about 8 dishes and all of us were underwhelmed by the experience.Eating at Girl & the Goat was such a disappointment for me. I have eaten at a number of restaurants that Â don't even have gluten free menus and have felt more accommodated. At no point did a manager or someone from the kitchen offer to step in and assist our floundering server answer my questions. If I wasn't so shocked and upset and flustered, I would have asked to speak with one of them. My suggestion to G&tG would be to get a consultant who knows what they are doing to look over their menus and create an accurate gluten free menu. Then train your servers on that menu and how to answer questions for customers who have food allergies."
"I stopped into Girl & the Goat for a quick bite and imbibe after a Bulls game, though we'd originally intended to grab a burger at Au Cheval after walking over from the United Center; the latter had a thirty-plus-minute wait for two, while the former could seat us immediately. Â Considering how hard it can be to secure a short-notice table at Girl & the Goat, I was pretty pleased.That's about the last bit of the experience that wasn't, at least in some fashion, disappointing.First, and generally, the various facets of ambience and atmosphere seemed to me mismatched--relative to the ostensible goals--to an extent that seemed almost chimeric, but not really in a good way: it's haute but/and casual, intimate but/and open, formal but/and the servers are all wearing t-shirts with baby-goat caricatures. Â But whatever: that's a minor stylistic disjunction that would have been--aloof from any other confusions and disappointments--either obviated or unworthy of note.Second: the drinks, the problem of which really reduces to that old saw: the quality versus price matrix. Â Considering the specifics of the brewed fare, each was overpriced by a few dollars (I paid $7 for a bottle of Lagunitas' basic Pale Ale); meanwhile the wines appeared overpriced by a bit more than a few dollars. Â Most damningly, however, was pricing-scheme of the cocktails: Violet Hour prices (to the cent: $13 per drink), sans the Violet-Hour-level conception or execution, and much skimpier moreover. Â For example: my friend had the ""Lift Ticket"", which I generously sampled, and, while it wasn't terrible, neither was it very well-balanced; it had an odd cocoanut expression that didn't really fit the apparent concept, and the rocks serving-size was shockingly scant.But whatever: I came here for the cuisine. Â And, unfortunately, that's really where the preponderance of my criticism resides. Â Indeed, I ultimately found one of the main problems to be similar to that of Little Goat: the menu *reads* very well--if a bit too zeitgeist-inflected, or too unoriginally original, as it were--but execution doesn't meet conception, and the actual dishes don't fulfill their abstract potential.Since I'm going somewhat against the grain here, however, I'd like to really elaborate my grievances: -- Fried pickles: Very good, crisp cucumber chunks, as opposed to slices, which worked well for the fry--and with a side of skin retained, which was a nice touch. Â The batter & fry itself was very nicely done, as was the tasty but not-as-noteworthy-as-anticipated yuzu sauce; the harissa was nothing to text your sister about, but served its spicy purpose, I suppose.-- Goat carpaccio: This was the real travesty. Â I was exorbitantly eager to try this: I love elegant raw-meat preparations, and goat was a bold choice even in spite of the putative goaty promise of the place. Â But this plate was overburdened, mixed-up mess: not enough goat (small, chunky slivers as opposed to thin, wide slices), not dressed right (a sherry vinaigrette whose sweetness overwhelmed the soft gaminess of the goat, the note that should have predominated), and muddled by conflicting, strident flavors (fried caper-berries; green-olive matchsticks; crispy-fried wonton strings; frisÃ©e; salmon roe). In the final tally, the goat falls pretty far from featured element: it operates almost solely at the margins, a background and not a backbone. Â It's like a raw-meat dish for people who don't like raw-meat; a carpaccio for diners who'd like to taste all the flavors but the carpaccio.-- Octopus: Parts of this cephalopod were very well grilled, but others were too small and (thus) too burned (Coetzee would say this is where ""burned"" becomes ""burnt""). Â The haricot vert tossed into things was too al dente for the mÃ©lange; the bitter, roasted lettuce--and I usually really enjoy grilled or roasted leafy greens--detracted rather than added, accentuating the pieces if octopus that were burnt. Â All together another dish--like the goat carpaccio--that by being too much ends up not enough.-- Escargot ravioli: This was at least very tasty, with succulent escargot, wrapped in a well-rendered ravioli dough, served on a nice subtle-yet-hearty, rich-but-not-thick sauce. Â The onion-crunch topping was also a nice textural touch that enhanced the bite of the ravioli, and it functioned well in the flavor-matrix of the sauce, pasta, and filling. Â Yet, even this dish was marred: four snail-stuffed ravioli for fifteen dollars, when--as good as they were--I could eat a full plate of the best escargot in Chicago at Watershed for $11. Â Or, if I just happen to be on that stretch of Randolph, I could head to Maude's for likewise-excellent escargot, much better drinks, and a lyonnaise salad that blows any item I had from Girl & the Goat decidedly away.To top it off, our server was a bit lame, and a bit more than pushy.How sad. Â I had been so eager to try this place."
What an amazing food experience. We sat at the bar & Lily really took care of us!
"This review is based solely on the food. I thought everything was too salty (and i usually tend to like salty food but it was too much), it was over priced and I left hungry. I don't mind paying for a nice meal, but I don't like leaving disappointed and hungry. This restaurant was overly hyped for food that isn't worth it. I felt like the chef was trying to add a lot of different tastes and styles that does not compliment the dishes. The 4 of us come here on a Monday Night, I had reservations at 9:30. It was pretty busy when we got there and we were able to get seated right away (which was nice). What we ordered:I started off with a glass of Malbec, and the amount of wine that was given was very little... not a good way to start off my meal, but i still had an open mind on the food.We started off with $4 bread... yes $4... i think the bread that we chose came with apple butter and a rosemary butter side. It was good, but it wasn't Â $4 good for 6 pieces of bread.Salted Green Beans - Â It was salty and it tastes like something you can order at a Chinese restaurant for much cheaper and the portion would be much larger. Hamachi Crudo - Â 4 little pieces of fish. it was not up to par for the price that they were charging usPan Fried Frog Leg - too salty and the meat was dryWood oven roasted Pig Face - Â One of the better dishes (only because of the sunny side up egg on top), the portion was ridiciously small.Wood fried Walters Chicken - Â for the price that we paid for it, it was too expensive for such little chickenConfit Goat Belly - it was just okayCrisp Braised Pork Shank - Â pork was dry and it was just okayMaybe we came on a bad day, but I dont know how majority of the dishes can be that salty. I was not satified with this restaurant."
"Great restaurant for a special occasion ($$$), just be sure to make the reservation at least a month in advance! Atmosphere is trendy casual, and the service was fantastic. The cocktail I ordered was one of the best ive ever had in my life. It's small plates, so we ordered a bunch of dishes and split them. The goat empanadas were my favorite. Broccoli was surprisingly out of this world. Make sure to not skip the bread either!"
"I was extremely impressed with this location. Â We ordered 8 'mains' along with 2 of the oysters, a bread, and every dessert item. Â The bread was a bit forgettable as were the fried oysters. Â The 'bacon' oyster was excellent. Â A good way to start. Â The goat empanadas were excellent, the blueberries extremely ripe. Â The lamb tartare was also excellent, blended with peas and a light sauce, it went well on the thin crackers. Â The escargot ravioli was... forgettable, but hey. Â The pig face was also excellent, but somewhat standard. Â The cauliflower vegetable dish had an asian element I was craving. Â The flank steak was also quite tasty. Â There were 4 deserts and we tried all 4. Â I enjoyed all of them, but the cinnamon sugar cracker in a rhubarb Â shortcake was quite the finish. Â The bacon butterscotch was scary in concept but may be the best item all night. Â I have not been impressed with little goat next door, leading to negative expectations headed in. Â However This was really as good as it gets, Â We ordered 2 bottles along with our extensive meal and paid $110/pp. Â Would do again. Â Quite affordable given the quality of the food we received. Â Hands down, better than grace which has a $400 pp degustation 3 doors down.It should also be noted the tapas style ordering improved the experience for the 4 of us as we got to be personal in dividing each others food. Â Its a nice element for a date."
The halibut here was simply delicious! The green beans were the best I have ever tasted... However in could pass on the pig face! I came here for my birthday and it was worth the wait! Definitely check it out.
"This place is probably one of the most Yelped about restaurants in the world. As a result, the reviews are a little all over the place, and generally depend on one thing: expectations. The Girl and the Goat is NOT a fancy restaurant. It's a modern, open-kitchen machine that turns out small plates/tapas-style for tables to share. If you're up for a loud night of cocktails and sampling with a group of friends, this is a perfect place to go. If you're looking for excellent food to impress a significant other, I probably wouldn't go here unless your date is a sucker for creative foods. It's loud. Very loud. Even at midnight when the doors shut and prevent further patrons from entering! We got our reservations on Open Table about 6 weeks in advance after I had stalked the website for awhile. I think going at 4pm is also another viable option for procuring some space.I'm surprised by the reviews that purport that flavor was lacking in these dishes. To me, the unique and powerful flavors were the hallmark of this food. Every dish had a very distinctive flavor profile that was unusual in some way -- and most of it worked, although on one dish it didn't. As for each dish:Pig face: slow-cooked pig cheek, and it was very good. It's basically a glorified roast pork. But the best part about the pig face was the little fried potato straws and the fried egg on top. The textures came together in a wonderful, crunchy, mushy way that I really enjoyed. This is definitely a dish worth getting. On the salty side.Roasted Cauliflower: Roasted and slightly carmelized cauliflower tossed with heaps of parmesan cheese, olive oil, pine nuts and mint. Mint!! This really gave the vegetable an unexpected kick, and those dainty pine nuts knocked it out of the park. The downside to this was that it was swimming in oil. It was way too greasy. Gives me great ideas for making cauliflower at home.Squash blossom: A hollowed out piece of squash stuffed with crabmeat, dipped in tempura and flash fried. Of course, delicious. Lacking body in flavor though. The filling was kind of bland. Texture was great. Only two pieces in a serving. Wouldn't necessarily order it again.Goat confit: Strange combination of confit goat belly (small piece, preparation similar to the pig's face, slow-cooked), lobster, ginger and some other bright citrus/cilantro flavor that didn't quite work in the end. Enjoyed the goat belly itself, but thought that the accompaniments detracted from the main attraction. Maybe they are afraid people won't be used to the strong flavor of goat?Butterscotch budino: Probably the best dessert I've ever had. GET IT!! Even if you're full, just get it. It's so light and refreshing. Light-as-air whipped Italian custard with cinnamon, carmelized cashews, butterscotch sauce and pineapple chunks. It was incredibly refreshing and the mix of creamy, tart, crunchy and sweet were perfect.Overall, we enjoyed our meal at Girl and the Goat. I didn't enjoy the fact that it was a loud machine. It wasn't a relaxing meal. But definitely something I'm glad we did!"
"I can't begin to say how much I loved Girl & the Goat. We are from Vancouver and this was the only place on our must try list. I'mSo happy we made it here because it in no way disappointed. We had to sit at the bar because all the seats were full but I'm glad we did. Our bartender and server Tony was so fabulous he competed with the food. He suggested four dishes (green beans, cauliflower, country fried loup de mer, and goat ribs) we tried all but the cauliflower and wow! This has to be on the list of best meals I've ever eaten. But besides that I need to mention Tony. He made our visit better than amazing. He spent the time to interact with us, get to know us, and even suggested some amazing places for us to visit for the rest of our trip. If I could eat here every day I would. Go! You won't regret it. P"
"Wonderful! Everything we had was delicious, food and cocktails included. Escargot ravioli was interesting. Only (big) downside is how hard it is to get a seat here at a normal hour. Who wants to eat at 10pm?"
Was here during RSNA and fortunately we had reservations months in advance. One of the best meals I've ever had. Had everything from broccoli to pig face (which was phenomenal). Definitely worth some advance planning. Cheers.
The grilled octopus is the singularly best dish I have ever tasted in my life! Â The rest goes precipitously down hill fast. Quit the reservation sham. Â Most importantly don't go here if you are hungry unless your the size of Barbie or G.I. Joe. Â I am really torn because the grilled octopus was like a religious experience but that is where it ended.
"Recently stopped by for light appetizers before a dinner reservation at another awesome Boka spot. The manager took such exceptional care of us that we will be back again and again. I forget her name, but she picked out the perfect items for shared plates. We had four women and the highlights were the oysters, the tuna, pork shank, yes a little heavy for an app but none the less so delicious and inventive as it was served as a ""build your own taco"" plate. We were a little full but oh so worth it!"
"My gf keeps taking me to all these expensive restaurants even though i'm perfectly fine with eating fast food. $10 as opposed to $130 sounds great to me, but I actually don't mind this place. Maybe it's the hype, she was on Top Chef so has to be good. Or could be the positive reviews from friends and other elite members, but I've been here twice and I don't mind paying that much (well I mind but I'm just a tad more ok with it). Went here in April and came back last weekend for my GF's birthday. Plan in advance, you have to make reservations months ahead of time. This review will just be for this most recent trip since it's still fresh in my mind.The menu changes slightly (last time I had the pork shoulder but now it's pig face) but this is what I had. Ordered the sweet corn goat cheese wontons. Really good, liked it a lot. No meat though but exactly what you would expect. Also got the grill seared shi tuna. That was alright. Pretty much just raw tuna that is slightly cooked covered in a sauce. The diver scallops were delicious. My only problem there was that it was $17 for 2 scallops. Yea they were big but whoa, 8.50 for one. yikes.Kalbi beef ribs were next. They were alright too. I like the taste but I mean you could go to a KBBQ place and it would taste the same to me. Last was the wood oven roasted pig face. Our server said that was the most popular thing on the menu. To me it was alright. I'm not a fan of yolk so I don't like runny eggs. I also don't like tamarind. So whenever I tasted those (you just mash everything together) it was eh. But the pork was really good though, as was with the shoulder last time.Got the Budino dessert. Forgot what was in it but there's bacon and toffee in it. Delicious. Got it last time too and didn't even want to try anything else. Def recommend that one. For drinks I got an iced tea and I don't think it's free refills since once she took my glass, I never got another 1, so be aware of that. And that was like 4 bucks already. Overall it was $130 for like 5 things, a dessert, iced tea, and a glass of wine. Special occasion so I was ok with it but whoa, quality over quantity for sure. Love the service here though, both times it has been excellent. From the waiters to the bus boys, everyone is on point."
Tried beef heart for the first time and I was pleasantly surprised!
"Definitely one of the great Chicago restaurants. Â Hard to say much more than has already been said. Â To me, the two must have dishes are the fried oysters. Â I am not normally a fan of fried oysters but these were great. Â The other must have, and I am the ultimate carnivore, is the green beans. Â Great taste and very ample portion. Â Pigs face was a very solid selection but I didn't think it was earth shattering, reminded me of corn beef hash.My only disappointment was the PB&J dessert. Â Only dish where I didn't feel I needed to lick the plate."
"I feel like I won the lottery! Â I came, I ate, I loved!Since moving the Chicago, Girl & The Goat has been the one restaurant I always wanted to try but never thought I would actually get to. Â I mean who knows what they are doing 3 months from now that they can make a reservation that far in advance?!? Â Okay, I might be exaggerating a bit...but this place is in serious demand. With just the brother-in-law in town, we decided to see how busy it was. Â It couldn't have been later than 8pm. Â It was BUSY. Â But we were feeling lucky. Â We were hoping to grab an open seat at the bar. Â First come, first serve. Â The bar was completely full. Â No more than five minutes went by when somehow by luck or magic, a couple finished right before our eyes. Â I felt like I was sliding into home, for the WIN, as we slid into our coveted bar seats. Â We started with a cocktail, from the Aged barrel list...my BIL is fancy like that, he's good people to know. Â We ordered a variety off the menu; roasted cauliflower, escargot ravioli, pork shank and goat empanadas. Â Every dish was rich with flavor. Â I loved everything, but the pork shank was probably my favorite. Â The meat was falling off the bone it was so tender.Pricey?...You betcha. Â Worth the month long reservation wait?...Um, how bout a late night walk-in attempt?Worthy of the hype?....Hellz Yeah!"
"One of my new favorite spots! We made a reservation and it took them 25 mins to seat us but they made up for that by giving us a glasses of champaign, and an additional dish on the house. Everything we had was amazing, must try the green beans, cauliflower and the octopus, but everything else we had was excellent as well. Already made another reservation!"
"I have mixed feelings here. The food is outstanding and creative! The interior looks fantastic (exactly the way I would furnish my apartment as well). That's why 4 stars is absolutely deserved!BUT.. it was extremely loud - both the noise from the other people in the room as well as the back music. We could almost not hear each other!! AND after our meal we wanted to order another course, because we were still hungry - and the waiter just said 'oh, the kitchen just closed' - even though she just took the order from the table next to us!! And so the couple on that table got their order while we were still hungry. No clue if she lied to us or if there is a good reason for this - but we were very angry and felt like a fool. So therefore, I'm inclined to only give 3 stars.. but well, the food was outstanding. So maybe that was an outlier. I would probably give it another try when we're in the city the next time."
"Dear Girl and the Goat,Although I may be your 2,258th admirer, I would like to declare my love for you regardless of the competition. I don't write love letters often, but you are worth it! Everything was amazing. I sat outside in a communal table and shared the space with five other of your fans. Tried the octopus, oysters, a few cocktails, and your famous Pig Face. You impressed me with your creativity and innovation. The food was absolutely sexy. When will I come back to Chicago to see you again? I hope very soon.Please accept my upmost love and admiration.Love,Gloria C."
"Seriously, one of the best dining experiences ever. Everything you order will be nothing short of phenomenal. I was hesitant to try the goat (I know-weird for an Arab) but dang was it melt in your mouth delicious!"
"Girl and the Goat has been HIGH on my foodie hitlist since Stephanie Izard beat out Richard Blaise to earn the title of Top Chef Season 4. Â I knew this wunderkind woman would be a force to be reckoned with once she returned to Chicago to conceptualize what any local or tourist alike would call bomb.com comfort food. Â Corny goat bread with goat cheese butter and corn relish (Peter Piper with fennel butter and chili cream cheese, not pictured). Â They make all their house bread with accompanying spreads and this was the PERFECT intro to what Girl and the Goat had to offer. Â I fell into a deep carb coma with just one bite and spread myself all over that table like creamy butter on a piping hot loaf of lalalalLOVE. Â Roasted beets with green beans, white anchovy, avocado crÃ¨me fraiche, and bread crumb. Â This summer salad's exactly what you'd crave after a long, hot day scoping out Chicago sites. Â Crisp and fresh with the slightest citrus tang to balance the sweet beets, my new FAVE way to consume the root. Â Sooo over the simple roasted variety tossed with arugula, the crunchy beans add the PERFECT amount of texture to a superb salad.Goat liver mousse with pickled rhubarb, orange marmalade, and crumpets. Â Effing RIDICULOUS made-fresh-to-order buttery baked crumpets fork-split for THE.MOST.SCRUMPTIOUS mousse you will EVER taste...like EVER! Â This excessive use of hyperbole is not an exaggeration as I loves me some crisp carbs with a pate salad. Â The accompanying sides make for a mix of sweet and salty, tangy and savory. Â The perfect late-night snack after clubbing and Chicago shenanigans.Sweet corn goat cheese wontons with sungold, apricot, ratatouille. Â This dish was my least favorite since I half expected an actual Chinese wonton to come out instead of high end ravioli. Â The wonton skin was soft and mushy, not at all al dente with a coagulation of meat and cheese at the chewy center. Â Had this been a soup-based variety, it may have hit. Â But soggy and overcooked definitely missed. Â Although the flavors were decent, the execution missed the mark for me entirely.Grilled baby octopus with guanciale, favas, radish pods, pistachios, and lemon vinaigrette. Â Beautiful bowl of summer colors punctuated by the crisp sliced radish and the gorgeous char of bite-sized chunks of octopus. Â I'm beginning to really enjoy how Izard maintains the fresh raw focus of all the organic veggies while highlighting the protein in a rich and thoughtful way. Â Makes for a beautifully balanced dish and this one was aces in my book!Duck tongues with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, and piri piri. Â HANDS DOWN my FAVE dish of the night. Â The crispy, chewy sliced duck tongue was INCREDIBLY savory with its fatty bits mixed in with tender meat. Â The texture was akin to deep-fried pork intestine (Ruoc heo chien don) a favorite since accompanying my dad on many-a-drinking-with-his-buddies (Nhau) outings when I was a wee little lass. Â Now biting into this duck salad brought back nostalgic memories for me bite after bite. Â Love it when food has that hold on you, some moments you never forget.Crisp braised pork shank with grilled spring onion kimchee, buttermilk dressing, and naan. Â OMG look at that honkin' piece of shank and tell me you're not instantly salivating at the sight! Â About the size of a man's fist, the tender meat literally fell off the bone as our server broke it down tableside for us to enjoy. Â Meant to be sandwiched between the baked naan with a bit of tangy Korean slaw, creamy buttermilk dressing, and a hint of red buffalo sauce, the balance of smoky ranch flavors made for the most gluttonous dish of the night! Â Ahhhhh heaven on a stick indeed!*Insider's tip: Â Who visits Girl and the Goat without ordering 8 luscious pounds of goat leg made to order? Â Our party of 4 sadly enough. Â I mean can 3 girls and 1 guy each finish 2 pounds each of aromatic mutton in one sitting? Â Doubtful, but by the time the scent wafted through the air at neighboring tables, I half-regretted it missing in action. Â Word-to-the-wise: Â Try booking a table with a party of 8 or more. Â That way you get to sample everything on their seasonally changing menu and that luscious goat leg could be dessert on a stick. Â Reservations book up FAST (I tried calling 2 months in advance, couldn't reserve a table, and opted to try my luck at first come, first served bar seating) and completely scored having arrived at 4:35pm to nap the first open table when they opened at 5pm. Â What I learned from the Chicago foodie scene: Â The early bird gets the goat honey. Â I half-patted myself on the back for a close call and sank my teeth into this delectable, delicious, all-consuming meal. Â One of my MOST memorable to date!*Bon appÃ©tit mes amis!"
"I've been to GatG a number of times now and my ultimate feeling is that it's just so-so. Â Which is contrary to Little Goat, let me say. Â The food is just a little too left of center as in, the flavor profiles are great but it's just not executed quite right. Â The best dish is the pig face by far. Â I also like the cauliflower dish. Â The hamachi is a bit on the boring side. Â The octopus I've tried twice and wasn't good both times. Â And I don't really remember the rest. Â It's just not worth the expense. Â They also make you wait even though you've made a reservation. That part annoys me. Â As does some of the seating. Â I always feel like I'm dining with the couple next to us because we're so close. Â This isn't New York."
It was lucky to get seated right away tonight since we didn't madd rsvp!!! Food was great !! The service was great and attentive. Highly recommend! Only complaint is the parking was very very hard to find.
Why Oh why are the portions so dang small yet so delicious! Not fair! This place was definitely worth the month long wait. I went with a small group and ordered a few different dishes which we all shared. Everything was full of flavor and delicious. The restaurant had a lively atmosphere. The staff was very friendly and attentive. I'm definitely a fan of this place.
"Food: Â We ordered the cauliflower, open pig face, salad, and pork shank. Â Open pig face was super awesome...I dropped my fork after the first bite. Â These food are meant to be shared so the serving is small.Service: Â Friendly servicePrice: Â Expect to pay $16+ per plateOverall: Â Best restaurant I tried in Chicago. Â I don't give 5 stars that often so this place deserves it."
"Probably the best food I've ever put in my mouth!!!!!!! I mean really what's not to love about this place?!?! Everything from the food (obviously), to the service and ambience was extraordinary!  Â  Â Let me begin by saying that I made reservations as soon as I booked my trip to Chicago, which was a month or so in advance (which I recommend, cuz this place fills up fast!).  Â  Â  Â Some stand outs of the night were the goat empanadas which were beautifully crafted and tasted out of this world! One of the most unassuming dishes of the night but definitely one of he best, was the green beans (which we tried to recreate at home, but, much to our chagrin, were unsuccessful).It may not be the sexiest pick on the menu but I guarantee you have never had (or ever will) green beans this amazing! Now, the escargot ravioli in the miso-tamarind broth! Holy Mother of God!!!!!! I think my exact comment to the server was ""I just want to climb inside that bowl and live there!"" The Pig face was ridiculously good but that is to be expected - I mean who doesn't order Roasted Pig Face when they see it on a menu! And finally, the miso-butterscotch budino!!!!! (Cue the angels singing) Not only the perfect way to end our night, this dessert was like nothing I've ever had in my life! Inexplicably, unbelievably great!!!! I could try to tell but you just have to try it for yourself!  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â As we were leaving the restaurant I went ahead and made reservations for the next time we would be in town. My wife informed me that that the next time we would NOT be sharing the budino - she would have her own!"
This is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. It's difficult to get into but if you go early you may be able to score a seat at the bar.
"I'm heartbroken that this is one of my last weeks in Chicago, but it was made a little brighter by this incredible meal. The ambience is rustic and dark, but I really appreciated the fun music selection.The wine list is very comprehensive and has a lot of interesting options. Their cokctials all looked great too - I opted for the best of three, which was light and balanced out the rich foods wonderfully. For three people we ordered the following (listed in order starting with the best): Goat Empanadas:the goat was so flavorful and the empanada crust was crispy and dense, but not too greasy. served with grilled blueberries and amazing saucePig Face: Â incredible, definitely can't pass this up - it's like the best breakfast you've ever had for dinnerGreen Beans: I want to recreate these at home - the portion is huge, but we ate the whole thing because they're fantasticGhums&Roses bread: perfect portion for three people and served with honey butter/applesauce spread. I want to try all her breads after this oneBroccoli: pretty good, but it's very smoky and heavy on blue cheese, so if you don't like blue cheese maybe skip it. Grilled octopus: also very good, loved all the crunchy things it was served with, but I'd probably try something else next timeFinally, we got an AMAZING butterscotch budino dessert - bacon toffee, cashews, whipped cream. I'll be dreaming about it the rest of the week. Long story short, go if you can!"
"For all of the hype, I was underwhelmed. Minus the hype, I would have been intrigued, but not impressed.The atmosphere tries to be awesome, but there are a few issues that wreck it. The tables are really large, which is great for having lots of plates on the table, but annoying because you feel the person sitting across from you is abnormally far away. The restaurant in general was loud, which added to the difficulty in not being able to hear each other. However, I could hear every word of the guy's conversation whose table was 4 inches from ours.The food was rich, and heavy. Some plates we ordered that I thought would be on the lighter side were not light. I described it to my boyfriend as ""man food"". I dont know. It was ok."
We were expecting a lot better experience with all the hype but were a bit disappointed. Interesting dishes but only a few really stood out. All in all underwhelmed.
"Food, drinks, and service were all a win. The service was quick, attentive, and full of excellent recommendations. The cocktails are well-balanced, and food is delicious. The food packed a significant punch in the flavor and texture department with each course out-doing the prior. The waitress did a phenomenal job pairing off our shared plates so that they were served with items that went well together. Recommend the goat neck, delicious!"
I wish there was one in Seattle! The Roasted Pig Face & Roasted Cauliflower were the top dishes we got! Could eat it every day!
A long wait but totally worth it!
"Got a late night reservation day of on a Wednesday which was nice. Â My brother was in town and I thought I'd show him the food that Chicago has to offer since he's in the industry. Â Brought a bottle of Alexander Valley Vineyards Cab at the cost of a $25 corkage fee (which did not end up being charged). Â The highlights included the Rye Bread, Skirt Steak with strawberry. Â The goat confit was also nice, but almost too rich. Â Brother said the Sockeye was great, I thought a bit dry. Â Brother also liked the duck - I thought it was very moist, but I'm not big into the flavor. We had the broccoli as well which we both though was a bit to rich on blue cheese flavor and too heavy. Â The interior very nice - both modern and rustic. Â Our server was excellent - attentive, knowledgeable and there about the right amount of time. Â I've probably had better food, but overall, it's a 4.5 for me with my brother's opinion moving it to a 5."
"This is without a doubt a foodie experience. Everything we ate was original, Â tasty and fun. There are too many options to explain all of them but I recommend going with something you haven't had before...goat belly? Pig face? Try it! You won't be disappointed. Get some bread too, the specialty butters are worth it. All plates are meant to share so get around 2-3 per person. Lots of specialty beers to go with a full compliment of wines and cocktails.Vibrant and energetic scene too...this place is noisy and full of life. Not the place for a quiet conversation. Reservations can be made through Open Table but given the demand, you will have to do it a few months ahead of time."
"Awesome, fully lives up to its reputation, intense confluence of flavors and tastes in every dish. Moderately priced, classy service. We tried the pig face, goat belly, chickpea fritters, and the spence bread."
"Made dinner reservations 2 months in advance and the only time slot available for a Saturday was 4:30! Â I was pretty skeptical and tried to manage my expectations, and this place is definitely worth all the hype! Â The menu is so diverse and every dish was excellent! Â We ordered 9 dishes for 5 people. Â This was a good amount of food, but we did have a couple beers before heading there so keep that in mind. Â Chickpea fritterGrilled shrimpDiver Scallops Escargot RavioliDuck Tongues: SO GOOD!!! MY FAVEPig Face: MY OTHER FAVEPork ShankGoat Empanada: SO GOODGoat Belly: MY OTHER OTHER FAVEDon't get me wrong, all the dishes were amazing and you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Â But, those 4 dishes were standouts that I would order again and again!"
"We didn't make reservations but managed to get a couple of seats at the bar. Â There were seats open at the bar almost the whole time we were there. Â I suggest a reservation if you want guaranteed seats. Â Also, parking isn't easy. Â We had to drive around and walk a ways to find a spot. Â Although we didn't use it, they do have valet parking as an easier option. Â We loved the decor and ambiance. Â The warm, generous and friendly service was also 5 stars. Â  In fact, I'd give them 6 stars if I could. Â Tony explained every dish and made outstanding recommendations. Â Jesse entertained us with good conversation and kept our glasses filled. Â We started off with the Pan Fried Shishito Peppers with Parmesan, Sesame, Miso. Â The peppers were seasoned well and tasty. Â Next arrived the Wood Grilled Broccoli rogue with smokey bleu, spice crispies. Â We almost sent them back because we didn't order them. Â It was a surprise from Tony and Jesse who were kind enough to give us this dish on the house. Â Thanks guys! Â The Wood grilled broccoli was my favorite of the night because of the smokey big bold flavor. Yummy! Next came the Goat Heart in some sort of exquisite savory and slightly sweet sauce. Â It was unreal. Â I was a little nervous because I am not usually a heart type of guy but you have to live a little and trust your servers. Â My friend Molli ranked the Goat Heart number one of all the dishes we were served. Â Next came the Escargot Ravioli with bacon, tamarind-miso sauce. Â The pasta was unbelievable -- freshly made melt in your mouth and cooked to perfection. Â It was once again, a great dish. Â Next came the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face with sunny side up egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix. Â Pig face sounds weird but again you have to trust your server and I'm so glad we did. Â It was exactly like Tony said ""a combination of breakfast lunch and dinner"" Â Yum! Â Molli and I both rated the Pig Face in our top two dishes of the night. Â Next came the Miso Butterscotch Budino with Bacon Toffee Glazed Pineapple and Candied Cashews. Â This dessert was out of this world good. Â Molli and I both raced to get the last bite. Â It was absolutely heavenly! Â If I could only have one dessert for the rest of my life -- this would be it. Â Tony and Jesse also brought us out a second dessert, on the house -- Sticky Date Cake with Montamore Gelato and Blueberry Preserves. Â The gelato was to die for. Â I don't think there's a bad dish on the menu and everything was fairly priced. Â My compliments to Stephanie Izard and her whole staff. Â I'd eat an old shoe if it was Stephanie who was preparing it. Â Outstanding job! Â Molli and I had a great food experience and can't say enough about the service. Â You hired good people Steph. Â Thank you to all-"
"Still amazing!Went back a couple of months ago and was equally impressed if not more than my first time a couple of years ago. This time around had Friday night reservations. The only available time was for 10:30pm. It worked out. We hung out at a blues bar first and then headed there.It was crazy busy with no sign of winding down. The decor is outstanding in a hip industrial style. I would say GATG is basically infinitely trending. It's always like it just opened except it has been open for a while now. We started with the onion bread and ordered the goat cheese tortellini, shrimp ceviche, scallops, octopus, escargot ravioli and pork ribs. Yes, it sounds like a lot but it really is not. Portions are small and meant to be had tapas style. We had the quatro leches for dessert. Everything was unusual and delicious as usual. Ms. Izard did not disappoint again. Make sure you check out the very cool bathrooms downstairs!"
"One of my favorite restaurants ever. The food is perfect, great ambiance, terrific service."
"I can see what the hype is about this place. They take ordinary dishes and make them so flavorful and creative. It's definitely a unique dining experience. Really loved the chickpea fritters, fried Brussels sprouts and the tempura. Great service and seated quick! Bit pricy overall though!"
"Everything about this place is amazing from the food, to the ambiance, to the service. Our waiter, Hunter, was very kind and patient and checked up on us frequently. He also took the time to introduce their very seasonal menu which could be confusing at times to amateur diners. I particularly like their focus on vegetables in addition to catering to the most voracious carnivores. I had a beet's salad that was very refreshing and balanced the goat belly and pork knuckles I had perfectly. Even though Hunter checked up on us often, he was not the only person serving us. Other people frequently came to clean up our table, take away empty dishes, change plates, and pour water for us during our entire stay. I left full and very content.P.S. the desserts here are great too!!"
The food is fantastic! Â  Standout was the tartare and the Pig face. Â  Best dining experience we had in Chicago.
"This place was the f*ckin bees knees. Not a huge beer selection, but the food...oh my god the food. Came here after one of the Lollapalooza nights.I don't even remember all the things we got, but I do know...the goat empanadas made my mouth happy. And the service was friendly. And I just...was so happy after I ate the food. I'd definitely go back here and eat all the other things when I get a chance."
"Went to Girl & the Goat two years ago and LOVED it. Chef Steph was serving the kind of punchy, acidic food that reminded me of what Joe Dobias called ""Angry American"" at his New York restaurant Joe Doe. Five Stars for the 2012 combo of food, service and ambiance.So I was very excited to go back earlier this month. Unfortunately, the 2014 version of G&G seems to have lost some of its zip. Still good, mind you, but I wanted to be bedazzled. And, yes, our reservation was in the very non-hip 6:30 Sunday time slot, but even so, I was shocked to see... I can barely write it... families. Families with Children. Oh, Girl & the Goat, what has happened to you? So, the food has slipped, the ambiance has slipped. The service still rocks. Huzzah to the service team! Unfortunately, I can give 2014 version of Girl and the Goat only Three Stars.Five stars in 2012, three stars in 2014. I'm going to average it and go with four. And next time I'm going across the street to the Little Goat instead. Maybe that's where the charm now resides."
"One of the best meals I have ever had in my life.A friend and I shared the pork shank, octopus, goat belly, scallops, and a veggie dish that I can't recall. In summary, the food is absolutely incredible. How good? I can assure you it will be one of the best dining experience you've ever had. The pork shank and octopus were unbelievable. The scallops and veggies were only a fraction behind the pork and octopus. And the goat belly, while not as memorable, would have been a star in its own right if it weren't for how amazing the other four dishes were. And cost? After ordering 5 dishes for two people, we ended up paying around $130. Not bad at all.Want a comparison? You're getting one. The night after eating here I had dinner at Longman and Eagle in Logan Square. Longman and Eagle is the restaurant that has the Michelin star...so it should be better right? Puhlease. I don't know who is in charge of giving out these Michelin stars but Girl & the Goat is several tiers above Longman and Eagle. It's not even close."
"Okay seriously, I have lived and traveled all over the east and west coast, and I have never been to a better restaurant! Â While in Chicago, I got to yelping and found this little gem, which I had remembered from Top Chef. Â I tried to get a reservation that same week and the best I could get on a Friday night was an 11pm reservation. Â No problem - my party of 4 would cruise around downtown Chicago, grab a snack and have a late dinner. Â Around 8pm, after 3 rounds of drinks, we decided we were getting hungry and maybe we could snag an open bar spot and get some grub before 11pm. Â As luck would have it, we did just that! Â The bar has great open community tables with plenty of seating, stools, couches, etc and an atmosphere that probably tops the dining room. Â Laid back, relaxed, swanky, rustic and inviting all perfectly describe this restaurant. Â Even the bathrooms were cool! Â Everything here is served family style (yes!) and two of my non-foodie friends were pretty skeptical when I wanted to order all the ""weird"" dishes on the menu. Â We ordered the cauliflower, grilled baby octopus, pig face, goat liver mousse, and pork shank. Â Seriously, each dish was better than the next! Â Top that off with a few bottles of wine, a fabulous wait staff, awesome 90s music, friendly patrons, and you are in shear foodie heaven! Â We devoured everything and with tax and tip, everything came to about $50pp. Â SO WORTH IT! Â We were so stuffed when we left and everyone agreed that this was one of the best meals we had ever had. Â We couldn't decide which dishes were our favorites as they were seriously all outstanding. Â This place doesn't miss a beat! Â Reservation or not, get here!"
"Finally managed to get a reservation at Girl & the Goat during my trip to Chicago! My reservation for 2 was made about 3 weeks in advance for 8pm on a Monday night. We came on time and were seated at once. Service:The service was really good - our server was very friendly and helpful. She was animatedly walked us through the menu and was very knowledgeable about each of the dishes we asked about. Also, between dishes, our plates were promptly cleared once we were done and the timing between each dish was sufficiently spaced such that we were usually just about done before the next dish was ready to be served. Food:1) Escargot Ravioli ($15)I liked it. It tasted like an escargot filled dumpling and it was earthy and juicy. I don't think there was cheese in it, so that definitely appealed to me. 2) Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face ($16)A must get! Basically this dish comprises of meat pulled from a pig's face that has been roasted for many hours. The meat is very succulent (just imagine how soft and tender the cheek of a fish is. same goes for a pig). It's topped with a sunny side up (break the yolk and mix it all around) and the little potato sticks gives a slight crunch with each bite. 3) Grilled Baby Octopus ($15)I've tried the grilled baby octopus at both purple pig and quartino, and GATG does this dish very different from the aforementioned. This dish is more of a salad with grilled baby octopus bits mixed in. 4) Confit Goat Belly ($19)This was an interesting and delicious take on surf and turf. The goat belly was tender, but it was the bourbon butter and chunks of lobster and crab that made the dish for me. I felt that the goat belly did not stand out as much as the other elements did, but the dish worked cohesively.5) Hamachi Crudo ($16)This was my favorite dish of the night. The hamachi was super fresh and it complemented the pork belly so well. I loved how there were so many different textures with each mouthful. So glad that I ended my meal with this dish! So we spent about $50 per person (we did not order any drinks or dessert) and left full. GATG serves fantastic food, has excellent service, and is definitely deserving of its long list of awards. We'll be back if we can plan a trip far enough in advance!"
"Delicious, trendy and almost as good as Avec....but not quite. Great dishes to share, albeit some were a bit salty. Great ambiance"
"Had a great time here, it was worth the wait (3months). The decor is beautiful and the food is amazing. Every dish is excellent, you will not be disappointed. Enough said try Â this place, even the service is on point!"
"I love the ambiance of this place - not too crowded but lively, background noise without being overly intrusive to your conversation, and an open kitchen that isn't overwhelming the space. Their selection of drinks on the menu was just right - enough variety without excessive page after page to search through. The service was prompt despite a 10:30pm reservation, and the food was delicious. The lemon vinaigrette on the the grilled baby octopus was a bit overpowering but the octopus itself was soft and not chewy. The trout was a little disappointing in that I was hoping for more of a sear to it, but the quail was absolutely the best course of the evening - full of complementary texture, taste, and visual appeal."
"This has been on my restaurant ""bucket list"" for a while, so I was obviously pretty excited to check it out. Even on a Wednesday night, the wait was pretty long, but unquestionably worth it. (With Haymarket just down the street, no wait is bad.) Our server recommended 5 or 6 dishes for the two of us, but after getting 6, I'd say you could do nicely with 4 for 2 people. Just a thought, and would vary depending on the size of the dishes, of course."
"My first time ... Lake effect was tasty cocktail, next time dinner"
"I had a previous review where I wasn't a fan but I went again and ordered completely different items and was very happy. This time I went with a friend who is a James Beard chef so she did most of the ordering. The Goat Empanadas are insanely good. We ordered so much food that I'd have to review the menu to remember it all. Chefs like to taste everything. All was excellent. The vibe is great, good music. Â Previous review: I had the Goat foie gras which was just a weird tasting foie gras, liver. Bacon Bread was fine. Cauliflower was kinda gooey, the halibut was small as hell and just fine. The butterscotch dessert was way too sweet but that's a Chicago thing, the sugar here is kinda ridiculous as well as the dressing on salads so no more desserts for me and dressing on the side. Â Espresso was fantastic as well as my Martini. Oh and the olives were very good."
"Like I do with any first date, I had many high hopes for this place, probably to the point that I put it on a pedestal, from which the fall is far. Â  Walking in on the first rooftop patio day of the season (a Tuesday around 8 p.m.) there was of course a loooong wait for the restaurant but seats at the bar (score!). Â The lovely bartender promptly noticed us (me and my first date companion) and gave us just enough (but not too much) time to peruse the drink menu. Â We each had perfectly executed cocktails (although at this point I can't remember what we had). Â Now onto the food...if you are at all a picky eater (I've gotten better but I still have my preferences), have food allergies (I'm allergic to shellfish), or are a vegetarian/vegan (or a meatatarian), then this place is tough for you. Â There is so much crossover- shellfish in meat dishes, bacon in fish dishes, weird stuff with other weird stuff, etc, that it makes it tough to avoid. Â And since this was such a highly regarded place (and I didn't want to seem like THAT girl), I didn't ask for any modifications to the dish.Everything was good, but I had a hard time finding something I could eat. Â I was disappointed in the ham frites which I thought WOULD have meat in them but in reality was just fries. Â My vegetarian companion could have none.I'd come back for drinks and the service, but I don't know if I could do the ""Where's Waldo"" of things I could eat again."
"Don't understand the hype. Maybe a lot of diners/daters are desperate for something different. If you like dining as an experiment, you may love this place. Me, not so much. We enjoy cooking our very healthy and fresh meals at home most of the time. GATG didn't compare. Their food was more like throwing paint at a canvas than a thoughtful composition."
"Love the rotating menu. Â Love the attention to detail. Â I love that you can get incredible, well transformed food for affordable prices. Â Stellar."
"I always feel like I am missing something when I come to really hyped up restaurants. Â I think my expectations are just much too high. Â So we made a reservation in November and finally got to dine at the Girl and the Goat in March. Â The restaurant is cute but it is crowded. Â We were seated by the bar which was packed with people that are hanging out without reservations eagerly awaiting a cancellations so they can swoop in. Â All the food we ordered was good, it was fresh and some was unique. Â But nothing stood out that three months later while I write this review, can I recall what I ate.I do remember the service being great and the bathrooms being an interesting concept(a ton of individual ones... smart thinking there). Â Maybe Little Goat would be more my speed?"
"To this day one of the best meals and experiences I've had dining out. Service was superb, food was absolutely delicious, and the vibe was great. Still dream about the pigs face, Johnny bread, and bittersweet chocolate dessert with mushroom ice cream. Those who haven't been, must go. Â And though a walk-in may wait 2 plus hours, it is more than worth the wait!"
"I was here with 4 other friends. Â Our waiter, Peter was awesome. Â We were overwhelmed with all the amazing choices so he did a great job walking us through our options. Â We got about 10 dishes, and drinks and it only came to $60/per person. Truly delicious meals. Â Food didn't taste the same for a week. Â Thank you Stephanie Izard and staff for making incredible food."
"My mouth has never been so happy. My friend and I arrived 20 minutes before our reservation and yet we waited no more than 5 minutes before being sat by a very nice and informative host. Our amazing server (I do believe her name was Lee) was at our table within minutes and so began our excursion. We started with the Green Bean Casserole which was delightful, moved to the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (absolute heaven), ventured to the green beans (crack!!) and ended the savory portion of our meal with the Crisp Braised Pork Shank which was prepared so perfectly. As if all of this delicious food wasn't enough we moved forward with dessert: the Apple Buckle (oatmeal-graham streusel with brown butter gelato) and the Miso-Butterscotch Budino with bacon toffee and pineapple...hours later and the sweet, sweet taste still lingers. The ambiance was perfect: low lighting, rustic wood furniture, walls and floors, jamming music (think Alt Nation), and even lovely, super clean bathrooms downstairs. Although the tables are near one another I never felt cramped or congested; my BFF and I had perfect conversation without ever hearing anyone else's. Perfection."
"I was quite disappointed with the Girl and the Goat, perhaps because my expectations were too high. The roasted cauliflower was hard to bite and we had trouble finishing it. The duck tongue was fairly interesting and the citrus in its sauce complemented the crispiness of the tongues well. The goat belly was a disaster. It was very hard to chew because it was overcooked. The dish was not cohesive - the lobster did not go well with the goat. The dinner was saved by the pig's face though. This dish was very good, despite the egg's being a tad overcooked. It reminds me of Sisig, a Filipino dish made with pig's face."
"Let's just start from the beginning. We walk in, and guess who's standing right there at the front talking to the staff? Chef Stephanie herself! So awesome. She's pretty much my hero. It's a Friday night, and it's not like this place is brand new, but the wait is still an hour long. No problem, we'll just have a few cocktails at the bar. To make it even more fun, the bar area is first come, first serve, and dishes out the full menu too! So we meander over to the bar, get a few drinks, and check out the scene. The setting is dim, the decor is awesome, and it's just bustling with activity. We actually find a couple getting ready to leave two spots at the bar and snag some seats to eat sooner than we expected. Moving onto the food...everything just seems so delicious! We had a hard time deciding what to order, so we just asked the waitress to bring us out 6 plates of whatever she recommends as the best. We definitely weren't disappointed. Surprisingly enough, I think the corn fritters and green beans were my favorite! We stuffed ourselves, had a wonderful time, and really enjoyed a great start to the night. One and only downside...definitely on the pricier side, but totally worthwhile to check out at least once!"
"I have trusted yelp over and over for restaurant reviews. Â Well not on this one. Â I love unique foods and love to try new things. Â Wow did I get burned on this one. Â It was like a novice was in the kitchen; the flavors are developed by a heavy hand of salt, and huge ladle of fat and butter, yuk. Â To me sometime less is more when if you start with good quality fresh food.Another disappointment was how slow the service was and how unknowledgable the staff member was of the menu and ingredients.I left there and drove myself right to the cardiologist."
"Yelp let me down on this one. The concept of the place was great but food was horrible. Way over rated. Maybe a great place if you only ate fast food and frozen dinners your whole life. Actually I rather have a bowl of cereal at home then to come back here again.the water and ice tea were good! Also the warm olives were great. The two salads we tried: the beet salad was not yummy but you can tell they tried to make it contemporary and unique. It was not! The other salad which I don't recall it's name was like a basic salad you would get anywhere drowned in mayo. It had a weird smell right when it came.The pig face was horrible. Tasted like bacon and eggs. Some of the pieces of the face tasted more ""gamey"" then other pieces. Another over rated item on the menu.Lastly: the pork shank. The red sauce and the vegetable thing in the side where good. Also the bread was okay, a little too buttery for me. The shank it self: 1/5. It must have been over cooked and it didn't even have much meat on it. Some of the outside pieces were so crispy that you couldn't even swallow it. Overall a horrible experience and a waste of a night. The waiter tried her best and was nice. No complaints there. She actually removed that ""mayo salad"" off the bill for us. I was not in the mood but the only thing we should have really payed for should have been the ice tea, bread, red sauce and vegetable that came with the shank. Do not come here if you are looking for quality food. I don't understand all the great reviews. Just to be clear, I really tried liking this place as I am a foodie and love quality, innovated and delicious food. We left this place hungry and feeling disgusted! True rating: 0.5/5 stars"
"Food is too salty, none of the 5 dishes we had was really great. Service was good. Among the food the roasted cauliflower was the highlight - that says it all."
"Came for my bday dinner with my amazing boyfriend. Had to reserve one month in advance! Place was packed, but surprisingly not too loud. Service was awesome and fast. The food: We had the challah bread with the salmon Â dip. Yum. Not too fishy and the cream cheese was whipped so light and fluffy. It was like a dreamier version of a lox bagel. Super light and just enough to rev up the appetite.Next we had the chickpea fritters which were so creamy and delish with a Â golden fried crust. The salad underneath was tasty too. Nice balance of acidity and savory.Who would have thought a vegetable could be so comforting. We devoured the escargot ravioli. My man ""never had snails"" but ate every pillow of stuffed ravioli. Pig face. Super savory! Very tasty. Loved the egg on top.The duck breast was by far my favorite dish. Perfectly composed and balanced. Cooked to perfection. We also had the old fashioned's to drink and they were hands down the best in the city. My lovely boyfriend surprised me by secretly working in cahoots with the general manager and other staff members and had them prepare a flour less chocolate cake as a surprise. I mean they went above and beyond. It's refreshing to have a dining experience that is so fulfilling. Alyssa Patt was so awesome to take the time to assist my boyfriend in surprising me. You would think this restaurant that has become so popular might have a pretentious attitude like so many others but they all made us feel like we were dinding amongst friends and family. Loved everything about this place and can't wait to go back."
"FOOD:Sugo - best dish of the night. home made pasta, similar to a super mature refined bolognese. had really soft stewed goat meat, and some cheese. Scallops - delicious, came with two pieces, and had some unique flavors dressing them. some green sauce.Goat belly confit - surf and turf concept. this was good, but i wouldn't order again. Too much meat on one plate. They had goat and crab and lobster on it! Really rich and fatty sauce as well. Kohlrabi Salad - fennel, gooseberries, almond, cheese - great texture, very small dish, interesting flavor balance w berriesDrinks: - bf got a mixed cocktail, and he said it was deliciousWine - I went with wine, but didn't know which one of the two lighter reds to get. Waitress was kind of enough to bring two small samples. I couldn't decide between their pinot noir and mencia. went with the Mencia, it's delicious spanish wine!Dessert: Galangal chocolate dessert - really interesting textures, crispy wafers, chocolate, and ginger ice cream. similar to a decomposed snickers treat.Creme brulee in a jar - beautiful but alittle too rich for me. great burnt first layer though.SERVICE:Great, as you can expect in a nice restaurant, waitress really took care of us. she was definitely busy and she either misheard or forgot that we ordered the kohlrabi salad. however she apologized right away, and brought us out a free extra dessert at the end of the night. what a nice treat. also amazing that she brought out two wine samples for me. They space out all your dishes, from lighter to heavy, i love when they pace it for you.ATMOSPHERE:very hipster, exposed brick/exposed exhaust loft style, very happening on a Sunday night, lots of people, we went at 8:45 seating, but peopl were still coming in at the past 10 pm seatings, so don't worry if you come late. There are booths and tables, and we fortunately got a cute corner booth.RESERVATIONS:harder to get than most restaurants. I did the surfing the open table route, i'd click randomly for dates in the future till I found an opening! I recommend looking at weekdays, or later seating times, and smaller group size. maybe if you have a specific schedule in advance you can call ahead and snatch that table?OVERALL:Finally visited Girl and the Goat. This was a restaurant that I had heard much about while i was in LA. Now that I moved to Chicago, the first stop of many delicious restaurants in restaurant row was GG! The food was great, and atmosphere even better. I had a good time and will go back again!"
I was scared to order the escargot ravioli only because I had a bad experience Â with escargot when I first had it at another restaurant years ago (think of the pieces of shell that are in a bite when they don't shuck oysters well...the same happened with escargot shells). To my surprise the ravioli was very tasty and didn't have that nasty chewy consistency. The goat belly had a nice crispy outside to it and paired great with the crab and lobster. The service is of a luxury restaurant. Our table was always cleaned and our drinks were always replenished right away.
"I would review this place more, but all the other five star reviews have taken all there is to say. It is amazing. Take your time with your server to ask questions and listen to suggestions. They know what they are talking about and are kind about it! If you are on a date, try and snag the chef's table, it's awesome and adds a level to the experience. Relax and enjoy the experience, these people know what they are doing and do it well!"
"Living in Chicago- you have high expectations for dining period. So when a place like the Girl & the Goat gets so much hype- the bar is set very high. I have to tell you- this place did not knock my socks off - at all. I found it to be very overpriced for tiny small plates that were meant to share- esp when some don't even have enough for a table of four to share. The food is tasty but not out of this world tasty that makes me say- Oh I have to come back and have that again, The service is impeccable-- our server was not only very attentive but very well versed on wines and the dining selections- if I could rate it on service alone- it would get five stars. but sadly their dishes fall far behind the quality and excellence of their servers.I am glad I went - in saying that, I've done it and I don't have a need to visit it again,"
Service and food was amazing!Our waitress was also amazing. She give us 2 different things to sample without charging us. No wonder this place has just high reviews. This place is a must if you are in Chicago.
"This is it guys... my LAST review from my trip to Chicago. I know some of you were wondering when it was ever going to end, but here it is... the end of the line. Just in case you were wondering, I saved the best for last. ;)I called G&G in advance to get a reservation and they wouldn't budge. Every single day of my trip they were completely booked. I figured my only shot of dining at G&G was to come here early and thank god it worked. My friend and I came on a Thursday at 5PM and we were immediately seated. They did tell us that they needed the table back at 6:30. No big deal, we eat fast... sorta. The atmosphere open and I really liked the decor. It's sort of dark and woody but it all looked very nice. There were a lot of great sounding items on menu, but we narrowed it down to a handful of dishes. Like a lot of restaurants these days, plates are meant to be shared here... haha well, we would've done that anyway.Sauteed Green Beans - Best freaking green beans I've ever had. If you don't like veggies, this dish will make you start. Even though I was stuffed to the max, I couldn't stop eating these.Pan-Fried Shishito Peppers - If you like shishito peppers, you'll probably like these. Unlike the usual sprinkle of salt on them, they're smothered in this creamy sauce which actually goes quite nicely with the peppers.Royal Red Shrimp Ceviche - I don't think I've ever had raw shrimp, but this dish was BOMB. It was the first thing that came out and we devoured it in like 30 seconds. I highly highly recommend this one.Diver Scallops - Scallops are always good, aren't they? G&G's scallops are good too, but I'm not too sure if there's anything that separates them from the rest.Grilled Pork Ribs - Tender meat that comes right off the bone. There's nothing more you can ask for. This was the last thing to arrive at our table and by this time we were slowing down.On top of great food came great service. The manager came by to make sure we enjoyed our food and thanked us for coming by. It's always a plus to see when the management cares about customer service. You MUST come here if you are visiting Chicago. If you live in Chicago, you MUST try this place. Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm heading here first. It was the definitely the best meal I had during my trip!"
"amazing food for an amazing value. Â We over ordered and ended up having to cancel the last coupe of items, including the famous pork face. Â So now I'm dying to make it back to Chicago to get back to this restaurant. Â  being a Kentucky girl, I usually have low expectations when it comes to Old fashioneds outside of Kentucky, but theirs was exceptional. Â Our total for 4 people with drinks and way too much food was $200. Â  We left happy and reeeeally full."
"TOTALLY WORTH THE WAIT! I heard you can sometimes get luck with walking in and get a table in an hour. We were able to make a reservation for 7 a few weeks ahead of time and it was one of the best experiences we've had. The entire group was thrilled with the food, craft cocktails and wine/beer selection, and service was excellent. Can't wait to go back when I'm in Chicago next."
"Absolutely amazing! I was so excited to finally eat here and it completely met all of my expectations! The fried pickles and cauliflower were delicious (best fried pickles I've ever had!). Seafood is all super fresh and delicious! The pig face was amazing...and I'm not a big meat eater...and the thought of pig face grosses me out....but none of that got in my way from going in for seconds(and thirds). Â The whole menu is very intricate and different....the biggest downfall of the whole place is that I can't afford to buy one of everything on the menu....but just to clarify...if I could...I soooo would ;) Great ambiance, terrific service. Truly a wonderful experience!!!!!"
"We thoroughly enjoyed our dinner at G&tG last night! Thanks Al Green for making us feel like celebs! Great service, outstanding food. Never in my wildest dreams would I say that pig face and goats neck would be my favorites! Can't wait to go back!"
"I have been to G & G twice, and if I had a ton more money I would go way more! Here is what I have had:Awesome:Sauteed Green BeansRoasted BeetsDiver ScallopsBraised Beef TongueGoat EmpanadasGood:Pan Fried Shisito PeppersKona Kampachi CrudoWood Oven Roasted Pig Face"
"Every dish is thoughtfully and carefully executed resulting in unique and creative dishes. Every dish provides great taste, texture, and balance to set off all the senses. First course: bread. Where can you find homemade, artisanal bread so soft on the inside and crunchy and rustic on the outside. It comes with interesting spreads you didn't even think to put on your bread. Second coarse: goat empanadas. If you're concerned about eating goat, it doesn't taste weird or gamey at all. These are not the greasy or doughy empanadas you find sitting under a heat lamp. The garnishes sprinkled on top were exquisite. The light radish and sprout garnishes balanced out the rich cheese sauce and meat to perfection. Third coarse: grilled octopus. If you want to know what perfectly cooked octopus should taste like get this dish. Good grill flavor is nicely perked up with the lemon vinaigrette. Fourth coarse: roasted pig face. Probably our least favorite. The meat is a little bitter and hard but presentation was beautiful. Dessert: plantain cake. Really, really interesting in a wonderful way. The cake is light like air but with one bite it surprises you with a mouthful of passion fruit. How in the world did they infuse those modest looking pieces of cake with all that flavor? The gelato was a bit too dairy tasting for me but it was quite a unique dessert. I'm not sure where the plantains were because I didn't see it. I would have never known there were plantains somewhere in this dish. I haven't even talked about the service. They run this like a well oiled machine. As soon as you finish one dish someone cleans it off the table and voila, someone brings out the next dish. Their timing couldn't have been better. Very efficient and fast service. It's a good idea to make a reservation for an early dinner before it gets real busy."
"Atmosphere was fantastic, cocktails were innovative and delicious, and the food...to die for! Â Duck tongues were very interesting and tasty, pig face ( yep, I said pig face) delectable, Â goat empanadas...whoa, octopus was delicious. Â I could go on forever! Â Fantastic experience from beginning to end."
"My flight to Chicago was delayed for 2 hours but it did not stop my husband and I come here for our reservation at 10:45PM even though we had to drag our luggage here due to delay. We cabbed here right after the airport because once we missed it, we would not be able to get a reservation for another month! Our effort was paid off. First of all, I was shocked the restaurant was HUGE. It looks like it could be an old warehouse-turned-restaurant and still, you have to wait hours to get a table and month to book a reservation. The bar scene is very vibrant too with tons of people at the bar drinking. The restaurant is pretty noisy so I would not categorize this as an upscale dining spot but the food is undoubtedly top-notch.We started our late dinner with their homemade onion bread. It is a fritter I think because it is so buttery and crusty and their homemade butter dip and tomato spread were beyond the world amazing. It is a must get on the menu. Then, we got the the Ham frites. They are the bomb! I could totally taste the ham-infused juice in the fries and they are crispy and smell of delicious ham. We also had the grilled baby octopus with snow peas and they are delicious as well. Then, we shared a plate of green beans drilled in some mysterious sauce with some walnut. They are very good but I think it is a little too salty. For entree, we got the Pig Face like everyone else raved about and were delighted we listened. The pig face comes with really soft and slow cooked pork with sunny side up egg and crispy taro fries. It is absolutely to die for. We also got the goat belly and it is equally amazing. Too bad we were too full and too tired to order desserts. Till next time!"
"Took my fiance there for her birthday. Â Made reservations 2 months ago. Â Place just has it all working ya know. Â The cocktails, the salad options and we had a Oh and our wedding went out the window with the sourdough bread and spread optionsRoast beet salad was awesome too. Â Drinks were real good"
"I had made reservations 3 months in advance to go to this restaurant after hearing and reading some rave reviews from others. The dishes sounded imaginative and I thought we were in for a good night of deliciousness.The wait staff was great and were attentive and helpful with the menu. The atmosphere was loud and bustling, but again, seems to be the trend in Chicago dining right now so whatever. I was expecting that.The food was disappointing. The chef should take some notes from Coco Chanel and remove one accessory before sending the plates out into the world. The flavors were too busy and we found ourselves saying to one another ""this would be good if xyz ingredient wasn't added on.. why is this here?""Honestly I'm really not sure why this restaurant has been getting such high reviews because our food was very mediocre and we never plan on going back. Don't feel bad if you pass this one up or never eat here. It's nothing more than hype."
"The Good...or rather the truly out-of-this-world (6 out of 5 stars): Â THE VEGETABLES!! Â Yes, all caps...that's how good they are. Â If you love well-prepared broccoli, green beans and cauliflower, you will not be disappointed. Â Never have I ever tasted vegetables so tasty. Â Neither will you.The Bad...or rather the uninspiring (2 out of 5 stars): the meat dishes. Â Had the goat empanadas, scallops and pig face. Â My overall opinion: ""meh."" Â The goat tasted range-y, not sweet. Â The greens on the scallops tasted dirty and I did not like the blueberry flavor in combination. Â And the pig face was only okay, no tang, no spice, just bacon-y.The Ugly...and surprisingly disgusting (-2 out of 5 stars): skipped the desserts at G&TG and walked across the street to sister restaurant, Little Goat. Â Tried the Choco Taco and Turtle Pie. Â Get this, the choco taco is made with ""sour cream ice cream!"" Â Foul stuff. Â I ate the whipped cream off the top and left the rest. Â The turtle pie was not actually pie but more of a tart (this was no brownie as advertised). Â A rock hard chocolate cookie tart with slimy brown sauce and cashews on top. Â (Hello! Â Anything called a ""turtle"" is made with pecans!) Â My daughter ate half of the Turtle Pie. Â I am not a pastry chef, but one look at me will tell you that I've had my share of desserts. Â So, an expert of sorts. Â And, these desserts were created by someone who does not appreciate dessert and is TRYING TOO HARD! Â Make is simple and it will be better. Â I would suggest heavy emphasis on good quality chocolate, caramelized apples, vanilla ice cream, raspberry sorbet, etc....Overall (2 stars): not worth the $130 for two (one beer each) for the evening. Â But, my daughter is leaving soon for her two year PeaceCorps service in Togo, West Africa and she really wants some nice dinners before she leaves. Â She is overall less critical because she is young and not paying the bill."
"I enjoyed it. I went there for the first time for my birthday. The ambiance was great. The food Â was good to great. I wished I had ordered a veggie because everything I ordered was so heavy. Â I had the goat empanadas, the pig face, ham frites and short ribs. The short ribs were my fav."
"This was one of the best dinner experiences I've had in Chicago. I went here last night with a group of 6, and the portions were perfect. We ordered tons of dishes and every single one of them was delicious. The one thing that stuck out to me most was how well timed the waiters were. They brought the dishes out at the perfect moment every single time. The mixed drinks and wine Â were great as well. They have their own vineyard, interesting fact."
"I am a big fan.That said, I want to direct the attention of the staff to a singular problem that I keep facing at some fine dining venues. Salt. Whenever I visit, I usually graze the entire menu (almost). By now everyone knows how everything tastes, so little point in getting to the details of the dishes.But, the Squash wontons and the skirt steak are where I stumbled. For the wontons themselves, they were quite flavorful. The sauce was overseasoned though. And when you are pairing it with wine or a sugary cocktail, the salt content seems very strong. Similar experience with the skirt steak where the meat was wayy to salty. Now, I imagine this is some of my problem. So I have decided to let the server know about my singular exception to too much salt. But the service was as usual quite spotless. Our server was very accommodating. I would brave the -27C again for the food and the warmth."
"Hunter is an awesome server!This was our second visit and much better than our first, when we ate in the private dining room downstairs. You don't get the same experience being down in the basement.When rating a dish we use a simple system - ""Yes, I'd order it again"" or ""No I wouldn't"" We're both pretty picky so a ""Yes"" is a big deal. We give everything at Girl a big YES! Here's what we had:Kohlrabi salad: Generous size. At first I thought ""why waste space on a salad"" but it was a solid salad. Â Hamachi crudo: A very small portion but delicious. Don't be scared off by pork belly being on a fish dish - it's just a few small cubes. Make sure you get a piece of fish, bread crisp and pork belly in every bite That's true for every dish we ate - it all tastes better when you combine all the flavors. The caperberries are small slices - I would have liked a few more but no biggie. Â Green beans: Yum yum. Giant portion, we brought some home. Pork Shank: Mmmm. Crispy pork. Ask for extra buffalo sauce right away. Â Pig Face: You gotta get this because of the way the eyes follow you around the room. JK. It's really just a small, delicious plate of pork (like bacon), egg and potatoes. Â  Budino: Pudding with crispy stuff. I like crispy stuff. All of this was accompanied by a delicious bottle of Malbec. We got home and made our reservations to return."
"This restaurant has a versatile environment...good for large groups or first date for two. We ordered four plates: sweet corn goat cheese wontons with ratatouille (one of the best meals of my life! The unexpected popcorn in this dish really made it stand out...delicious), roasted cauliflower, pappardelle with goat, and roasted pig face (meat from pig face with sunnyside egg and potato sticks). Again, the wonton dish was by far my favorite and really, the only dish I enjoyed of the four. Even though I consider this dish one of the best I've ever had in my life so far...I probably wouldn't dine here again as the menu in general did not have a wide array of appetizing options. My partner and I had a difficult time just deciding what to order as both the dinner and dessert menu simply lacked enticement. The decor was outstanding...wonderfully intimidating, inviting, modern rustic, elegant."
"The food was amazing,recommend everything on the menu because of how fresh and great the quality of the food is and the originality of the chefs. Â The pigs face is a must and so are the bacon fries. I had a road trip over the summer from LA to Boston and I took a detour that added three hundred miles just go eat here. It's amazing flat out better than any restaurant in Los Angeles, Boston or New York."
"Made reservations months in advance for my wife and I. Great ambience and great scene of what one would expect from a top Chicago restaurant. The experience left a little to be desired. Our waitress, Allison G., paid more attention to the patrons seated to the left and right of us. She took the time to thoroughly explain the dishes in great detail. With us, however, she seemed a little rushed and curt. She also failed to explain how our orders would be brought out - not simultaneously for each of us to enjoy our meals together as a couple, but one after the other, with the intent for us to share each dish. However, what I ordered isn't necessarily what my wife would be interested in, and vice versa. This created awkward moments where I would eat my meal while my wife watched, and vice versa. I would try this place again, but not in any rush to return. The drinks were great, though.Another complaint is that I made these reservations through OpenTable, and did not earn any points! Ridiculous. Customer service aside, the food was worth the 2-month reservation. Pork and Goat belly was great."
"This place is amazing! A must stop when in Chicago. Â Come with a group of 4 or 6 so you can try lots of dishes. Â They are small but great to share. Â Pig face, duck tongue, goat belly...sounds intense but everything is delicious. Â You just have to eat it to understand. Â Make Â your reservation today!!Desserts are worth saving room for as well!Valet parking for $10 is pretty convenient."
"Bring the credit card and go, do not pause...or think twice..just make a reservation.Bring a few friends and try the whole goat leg, it is a must for our next visit, and my friends, there will be a next visit.We brought our own wine, and it was worth it to pay the corkage with the jewels from our cellar.But you must start with a cocktail, we had rye Manhattans, and they could not have been made better by Tony (my fiancÃ©) who makes the best Manhattans in life.Though everything we tried was unique and good, I would not order a few of them again, the one time novelty was just fine.But.....the raw trout and muscles Â was outstanding, it did NOT need the tartar sauce that came with it, take my advice, enjoy the fish without the goop.The goat cheek was the standout dish...a foodgasm in your mouth...though we had many other good items, those two I would walk over hot coals for..Of course we tried all the deserts, again..nothing outstanding but all good."
"I can't even explain this place. Hands down best food I've ever encountered. All the dishes are small plate so 3-4 is plenty for two (especially if you're saving room for dessert). The goat dishes are all great, pork shank is absolutely insane, the broccoli, green beans, scallops are all amazing. Bar and lounge are first come first serve so if you can't get a reservation, walk on in and grab a stool or a couch. Great bourbon and wine list and lots of fun cocktails to get you started. Bartenders were great, super helpful with good allergy questions. I'm sure they laughed when I asked for Crown on the rocks. Cheapest whiskey there is Makers!"
Worth all the hype. Â Must go with a large group to get many plates to try as a group. Â We went with 4 and ordered 13 items perfect amount for 2 guys and girls. Â Most were excellent and our server's suggestions were some of the best. Â Would have been 5 star except desserts were 50/50.
"I can't lie, I've been looking forward to coming here for a while now. First of all, reservations are super difficult to get, so plan a small party and aim for bar seating or seating in the side areas on the couches. Also, get there right when it opens. Second, though advertised as small dishes, most of the dishes we got were pretty sizable (great portions). Definitely a plus.On to the food:- Wood oven roasted pig face - My favorite dish! So good! Mix the sunny side up egg and the pork cheeks all together to get an awesome flavor combination.- Charred pork belly - Melts in your mouth.- Wood fired Walter's chicken - Delicious skin, moist chicken. Interesting flavors.- Braised pork shank - Falls off the bone!- Diver scallops - Scallops perfectly cooked, and the kimchee is a nice sour/spicy addition.- Grilled baby octopus - Deliciously done. The octopus is not rubbery at all. And there's bacon in it!- Roasted cauliflower - Nice smoky and minty flavor.- Miso butterscotch budino - Love the texture, crunch, and well balanced sweetness. Overall a home run.Anyway, I don't think you can really go wrong here so just order and enjoy."
"The food and the service was great. I ordered the chickpea fritters, pork shank, the pig face and the confit goat belly. The goat belly wasn't my favorite though. Â I would say the pig face was my favorite. For dessert I had the apple buckle. The best part of it was the crunchy oatmeal chunks with the ice cream."
"If you're willing to suspend your sense of self-preservation for one evening, Girl & the Goat is the place to do it. This wasn't a meal so much as a stampede of flavor-detonating dishes.There is, of course, the mirthfully titled roasted pig face, so savory in its porcine essence that your palate pleads for a respite. The pappardelle sugo proved to be the most intensely satisfying bowl of pasta I've had in recent memory: wide noodles of unearthly satin were draped over a meaty pork and goat-based ragu, all of which was punctuated by tart gooseberries.A plate of goat belly, lobster and clams hobnobbed with vanilla as if they were lifelong comrades. To conclude the savory offerings, out came an utterly clutterless bowl lined with salsa verde, which served as the perfect vessel for my fork to conduct a series of adventures piling slices of beef tongue and pickled onions atop crisp shards of masa.And then there's the service, which was exceptional throughout the two-hour dinner, certainly better than I expected, and far better than it needs to be. Patrick, my tattooed server for the evening, exuded an infectious enthusiasm and couldn't have been defter in pacing the courses. But it wasn't just Patrick, for every member of the front-of-house staff I encountered seemed to be a bliss merchant.By the meal's end, I'm convinced I wore a look of fatigue and satisfaction, as a server who was overseeing another section of the restaurant stopped by to congratulate me on my feat of imprudence.I can't recall the last time I was so bowled over by a restaurant's food and service. Actually, on second thought, I can, and it was in the three-star Michelin institutions of Eleven Madison Park in New York and The Restaurant at Meadowood in St. Helena. Girl & the Goat is a restaurant worth crossing borders for, and I'm only too happy to report that I've found my go-to restaurant whenever my travels take me to Chicago.For photos from the meal, see the link to my blog: degustingdiary.wordpressâ¦"
"Blood pressure meds required after eating here!! Holy salt, everything and I mean everything was way too salty. I actually like the flavor of green beans and scallops but these were doused in a mystery salty sauce. Â The cauliflower and broccoli were no better only with cheese to top them as if it needed even more salt! You'd think desert would be spared from the salt machine. Nope, chocolate cake crumbles with salted caramel! I swear a drank a liter of water over the many courses we had. Only positive I can see are the drinks, service and interior design. Those are top notch. Too bad after waiting 3 months for a reservation only to have mediocre food is disappointing!! I'll go back but for drinks only."
"Sometimes writing a review is easy. Â This is the case with the instantly likable Girl and the Goat. Â As i step out of the cab i notice that outside is rather stark. Â It's typical of Chicago though. Â The decor, while not really remarkable is clean and efficient. Â Major props to the open air kitchen with seating for couples on either end.G&G is continually busy. Â It's a blessing and a curse. Â The atmosphere is aided by it but the food timing is not. Â I waited over 20 minutes between my amazing raw oysters in a muscatel mignonette with tarragon and the amazing wood grilled broccoli. Â The diner to my left had two dishes in this time.If the service from the host to the bartenders where not so engaging this would have lost them a star.When the wood grilled broccoli arrived I was underwhelmed till I smelt the aroma from the earthenware bowl. Â Served with a spoon I dove in. Â Amazing! Â Blue cheese, spice crispies (yes u read that right) rogue smokey bleu cheese- take me to heavenNext was the delectable diver scallops sitting over goat stir fry and a sumptuous plus tapenade. Â This dish showed depth and a masterful approach at mixing cold and hot to stimulate the pallet.My final course was epic. Â Wood oven roasted pig face covered in matchstick size potato sticks which where topped with a perfectly cooked sunny side egg. Â The plate was coated with red wine maple, cilantro and tamarind. Â Goat - please send this to me once a week!If you have not been here before, you must go. Â If you have - I'm jealous.Until next time - Dine fine."
"Went to dinner , sat at bar. Â AWESOME FOOD!. Â Had goat empanadas, duck breast, escargot ravioli, and chickpea fritter. Â  It was all so yummy. Â Get half portions 2 try different dishes. Â Knowledgeable staff. Â Definitely need reservations for a table. Â I want to go back to try rest of menu. Â  My only regret is I did not leave room for dessert."
"The waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person. We were at first unsure whether to take her up on the offer, but eventually realized the plates were relatively small or ""shareable"" portions as they put it. But the food was overall really delicious with very interesting mixes of ingredients. Â We got the lamb stuffed calamari, escargot ravioli, pan roasted halibut, wood fired scallops, lamb tartare, duck tongues, and pig face. I would highly recommend the duck tongues. Afterwards, I would say the pig face, ravioli, and halibut. The calamari and lamb tartare were tasty but did not really stand out. Finally, we found the scallops to be too salty and actually sent the dish back. The chef said that the dish was correctly made, so perhaps it just did not suit our palate."
Great food! Only go if you are adventurous and want to try different kind of food. Very nice atmosphere and fair price
"Ive yelped good and bad before and specifically about little goat....tonight I ate at girl and the goat. Â Wow. Service was quick, well informed, overall perfection. Â Good was great and I'm more the carnivore...the veggies here are to die for. Each bite develops more flavor and I find my self quickly going back for more. Â Great menu and staff."
"Just returned from my 4th visit to G & the G. I don't know when I will stop. For a restaurant in Chicago open almost 4 years that still need about 10-12 weeks out for a reservation to keep delivering the caliber of food you receive each and every time is a true accomplishment. I'm about 80% through the menu (which changes often) and I still die for the beet salad, octopus, pig face and pork shank. With the Little Goat across the street I also love that I can buy the bread! Just always a great dining experience. Adding to that experience is the staff of cooks and front of house experts. I've been lucky enough to sit at their expo ""chef"" seats three times and they really hire exceptionally talented and inviting chefs. I love watching them in action and asking a million questions on why they love working there. Last night we went to celebrate a 60th birthday. Our 7:15 reservation was pushed back nearly 40 minutes due to tables not wanting to leave (a terrible trend in the West Loop) and they could not have been more accommodating. Not only were we given a great table, but they also gave us our first round of drinks on the house. In such a busy, large space each and every person makes you feel like a VIP. Aside from the food - they are the reason I always return. Hats off again and again."
"I really love giving 5's, but I just can't do it for Goat.Really nice meal, Â the green beans are good because they loaded up the cheese and salt on top, and the pig face was literally breakfast with maple syrup (of course that's going to taste good!), but there wasn't a single stand out for me. I had 6 dishes, all worthy of enjoyment, none worthy of celebration.If you do have a wine / cocktail I recommend something fresh and cutting to balance the creamy and salty dishes. Good, not great."
Felt like this place was over-hyped. For some reason every dish had to be overly greasy. I mean it tasted good but not in a very healthy way.
"There is so much hype around Girl and the Goat, with the changing menu and impossible-to-nab reservations, but it definitely lived up to all of it! Â We were seated at the Chef's table at my request, and everyone on staff was AMAZING. Â My boyfriend recently broke his leg, and the host, servers, and valet were all extremely accommodating. Â Our server was so wonderful, friendly, and knowledgeable. Â She made us feel very comfortable and recommended great dishes. Â The food was out of this world, and both my boyfriend and I decided it was our favorite date we've been on thus far. Â Thank you for such an outstanding evening.Be prepared to share and spend a bit...each dish ranges from $6-$25 and they are small plate style (like tapas). Â We always enjoy this because we get to try different things, but end up spending more.Oh, and the roasted cauliflower is a must."
"Girl & The Goat is AMAZING! Â  I'm a Top Chef fan and a friend recommended this place, so I hopped on the L and walked the rest of the way. Â  It was absolutely worth the trip. Â Stephanie Izard is a master at putting together flavors. Â Here's what I had:The wine - Blended in house, so I asked for a recommendation. Â It was fruity and light and so yummy. Â  The meal - I ordered the goat enchiladas, not really thinking about the fact that tzatziki has dill (which I hate). Â I was a little worried when it arrived and I spotted the dill sauce, but it was great. Â There were so many layers of flavors in the dish that the dill fit right in. Â Every bite was a little different, and I ate the whole thing in no time. Â  The portion is smallish, but I felt like it was worth every penny. Â  The dessert - The bartender recommended the miso-butterscotch budino with bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashews. I had really no idea what to expect, but it was great. Â A weird combination of flavors that was just perfect. I would definitely be more adventurous on a return trip. Â In fact, I could easily eat my way though the entire menu, including the pig face. Â  My neighbor at the bar ordered it and it looked amazing. Â (PS...you wouldn't know it was a face unless someone told you)."
If youre ever in Chicago you need to eat here. After hearing so many great things about this place I decided to make reservation here for dinner. We order five dishes and each one was amazing. Our fav is def the Pig's Face.
It's all been said. One of the best restos I have ever had the pleasure of eating at. Very fascinating menu. Food is spectacular.
"It was wonderful! My faves were the steak tartare, green beans, scallops and cauliflower! The pug face was ok-wouldn't order that again but the staff was friendly and service was great."
"This place definitely lived up to the hype. Before going to Chi town for a weekend getaway, I asked friends for restaurant suggestions. Girl and the Goat was suggested by all of them. It was meant to be when I was able to get reservations while we were there. Here's what we ordered: - hiramasa crudo - delicious! perfect mix of crunchy with cracker, freshness of the fish Â and the pork belly was a nice touch - fried oysters - who would've though egg salad and fried oysters Â go well together? this was really good and pretty light for being fried - grilled baby octopus - one of my fav dishes of the night! super flavorful with an amazing mix of textures using really fresh veggies and nuts and perfectly tender octopus - roasted cauliflower - you can't go wrong with roasted cauliflower. the pine nuts were a nice touch - goat empanadas - this was the least favorite dish. too gamey - grilled pork ribs - perfectly tender, meat-falls-off-the-bone pork ribs with a delicious sauce - pigs face - didn't know what to expect when we ordered this but was pleasantly surprised. it was delicious! we just wish it didn't come at the end when we were all super fullthe desserts were a little disappointing. we got the red tea creme brulee and berry cobbler. we weren't super impressed by them and didn't finish them. you know a dessert isn't good when it's not gone.prices were pretty reasonable, drinks were good and service was great. i wish they would open one in LA so i can eat here all the time!"
"Girl and the goat is OVER-rated. Period. I'm not saying it's not good, it's better than average. But for a place with over 2000 Yelp reviews and 4.5 stars, I definitely expected to be blown away, and that didn't happen. Maybe it's too popular to keep its quality? Or maybe it's the branching out into little goat that distracted chef's effort and talent? To be clear, this is not the first time we came to g&g. We came here when it first opened in 2010, twice within a month, because back then reservation was WAY easier and we were simply amazed at how great the food was and how talented chef Izard was. Fast forward to present, it's near to impossible to score a reservation within two months, and the food we had really wasn't that great. Here's what we had: - Bread with tomato oil and mushroom butter: this was the best dish we had all night. The combination of tomato oil and mushroom butter reminded me of dipping the bread in tomato soup. The bread was amazing, not too hard, not to soft, perfectly fluffy. 5 out of 5 stars. - Oysters: I could be biased, but those were west coast oysters and I hate west coast oysters. We got the uncooked ones, so all I could judge was the little pickles on top of the oysters and they were OK. 3 of 5 stars. - Beets salad: this was extremely average. I regret getting it. It's beets salad with dressing and breadcrumbs. There's no complexity to it, maybe it's the point of salad? But I was eating it and thinking did girl and the goat really just serve me such an average salad? I refuse to even review it. - Escargot ravioli: the sauce was very tasty. However, we didn't think the concept of escargot ravioli works--it's a little too dry if you just eat the ravioli by itself. The escargot needed more butter, needed more salt, and the dish didn't give me enough sauce to compensate for the lack of butter or salt. 3 of 5 stars.- Goat belly confit: I don't like goat, so I ate the lobster on the plate. But this was a really one dimension plate--gamey goat, creamy sauce, lobster meat in some other creamy sauce. There's no contrast in either texture or flavor. And quite honestly goat and lobster really just didn't agree with each other. 1 of 5 stars. - Pig face: yes, this used to be my favorite and it has been on their menu since the day they opened. It's still very good, even though it was indeed on a little heavy side, I enjoyed every bite of it. 4 of 5 stars.- Miso butterscotch dessert: It was actually quite yummy. But I can't candidly judge anything butterscotch because it just simply can't compare to the unbelievably amazing miso butterscotch shake that I'm in love with at Allium. 4 of 5 stars. Â So overall, I was tempted to give a 2 stars. But one thing made it up a little--somehow, there's record in their system that we had food allergy. Even though we haven't been here in a LONG LONG time, they remembered. And our lovely waitress also made sure to confirm with us in the beginning. I'm a sucker for this type of attention to small details. OK, I will give it 3 stars."
"I don't know why I wasn't as impressed as others. Maybe it was the hype. I do admit that my expectations were really high but one taste of the salty food brought me down several notches. I really didn't like that we waited months for reservations and then also had to wait for a table when we got there. Â The only thing I really liked was the the veggie dishes. Â Order the roasted cauliflower! I wasn't blown away by the meat dishes we ordered. We had the Pig Face, the chorizo flatbread and I can't remember what else. I would probably come back though."
"Why read my review out of the + 2100 reviews? Well, because I don't say ""nom-nom"", ""delish"" or ""nummy"" in my reviews. With that said, let's begin. The decor is fantastic as was the service. Perhaps a bit pushy so as to ""turn the table"", but very friendly and casual. I would suggest that you order in the following manner:(1-2) Fat bread ($4.00) and Warm Olives ($7.00) which were a terrific way to start. (There were 15 types of olives for the olive lovers out there). (3) Chickpea fritter ($11.00) which is hard to describe, but I wouldn't order again; (4) Escargot Ravioli ($15.00) - she didn't care for it, but I loved it, especially the tamarind-miso sauce. (5-6) Finally, the green beans and pig face. A fantastic combination. Small plates yet, but I left satisfied and that's saying a lot for this big eater. Looking forward to going back soon."
"Came here on a whim the other night- I thought it was going to be impossible to get in, and the dining room had an 1.5 hr wait but luckily the bar/ lounge is first come/ serve and a couple got up and we sat down right away. SERVICE/ ATMOSPHERE: Sometimes the service in lounges can lack but my experience was anything but! Veronica was our server, she was as sweet as could be and constantly made herself available- I never had to wait more than 10 seconds if I needed something. She made great recommendations and her level of care really made my experience exceptional. The amazing quality of the food is a given at this restaurant but really good food can easily be ruined by inadequate service. Needless to say, she more than complimented the quality of the food. The only problem was as she was wiping the wood tables down in the lounge, she got this horribly huge splinter. She didn't make a big deal of it in the least and kept her face through the pain, but I saw the piece of wood that went into her hand and it was huge! I mean for the amazing ambiance, food, and service, sand the dang tables! I like the dark atmosphere but I was afraid to touch my hands to the table wondering if the same thing would happen to me. FOOD: Started with the Hamachi Crudo. Wonderful quality, extremely tasteful accompaniments with a variety of complimenting textures. I know it's an expensive fish, but the portion size did seem to be a little small for the price.Did a pork-trio with Ham Frites, Pig-Face ""hash"", and Pork Shank. Frites were incredibly innovative with a pork ""dust"" that wasn't overwhelming but definitely came through. The pig-face and pork shank were so unbelievably tender and again came with sauces, and starches that were a perfect compliment to the protein. OVERALL: The fact that I could sit down right away at a restaurant that typically has Â reservations full for a month and 2 hour waits (even on a Monday) was beyond amazing. The fact that our server, Veronica, was so awesome will definitely make me come back. It's so important to me that a restaurant of this food-integrity backs it up with quality service and my expectations were exceeded. We also finished with southport coffee- from seattle and not easy to find in this area- which was incredible. So even if you don't have a reservation, I recommend coming here and sitting in the lounge/ bar which was also super comfortable and right by the windows. Overall outstanding!"
"I've had this review as a draft for a couple weeks now, but it never seems quite right. Â I'm giving up and just going to contribute to the other 5 star reviews, because Girl & the Goat lived up to the hype, in my eyes.When my friend canceled on me last minute, I was sad. Â I had a long, draining week and after 3 months, the one thing I was looking forward to was dinner at Girl & The Goat. Â Luckily, another friend came to the rescue and I'm so happy she did.First of all, I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Izard shortly after she was announced as the Top Chef winner. Â She came into Whole Foods and instead of being calm, cool and collect, I stopped working and walked right up to her and started babbling. Â I don't even know what came over me, but you know what? Â She was one of the nicest people I've ever met. Â She laughed, chatted and was extremely down to earth. Â This was refreshing, as a few people who know me know which other ""big chef"" I've run into numerous times that I cannot stand. Â Regardless, I've been wanting to come here since before it even opened....and then once it opened, well, I was just really lazy and couldn't find anyone to go.Fast forward to a few weeks ago. Â Our server was lovely. Â She was patient and funny and explained everything in detail. Â When she suggested 4 plates total, I kind of scoffed at the idea, because I wanted to try so many things, but even 4 plates was a little too much. Â Then again, we ordered the ""Not Campbells"" bread, but by the time the 3rd item came out, we were nearly stuffed. Â Here's why I should have written everything down...I cannot remember the 1st plate we shared. Â It was a fish of some sort with crispy pork on top and caper-something. Â Everything about it was perfect. Â The flavors complimented each other nicely and those caper-somethings (not capers, I know that much) were not over powering in the slightest, just like our server promised.The next dish was shishito peppers with parmesan and, something. Â (See, this is why I should not be allowed to review places, my vocabulary becomes non-existent). Â This was a little bowl that seemed endless. Â I'm not even joking. Â We ate MAYBE 1/3 of it and had to stop because we had 2 more dishes coming out. Â Also, the heat was starting to kick in. Â These were great and our server suggested a box for them, and I'm really glad she did because I continued to eat them for a couple days after. Â The next dish was pork. Â Yeah, I'm not even going to try and pretend I remember what else was with it or how it was cooked. Â I just remember that as someone who doesn't eat pork nearly as much as I do fish or chicken, I wanted more. Â Then came the ham frites we forgot about. Â That was laughable. Â We ate some of them, mostly to try the sauces, but by that point we were full. Â I enjoyed everything we had and almost everything about Girl & the Goat. Â I could have done without the obnoxious people standing right over our table eating and drinking with their annoying conversation, but it could have been worse. Â If you're ordering bread and it's only 2 of you, definitely consider that as one of your plates, because as our server said, ""they're small plates, but they're not tapas....they're plated for two."" Â Also, much more affordable than I expected. Â The drinks are definitely where you'll spend your money."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago!! I have been here numerous times and every time I leave feeling impressed. Â Yes, the food is that good.Reservation at a decent time are hard to come by, but if you pop in at off hours you can usually get a seat at the bar. Â Try as many things as your stomach will allow, there are so many exciting flavors on the menu. Â A must every time I go is the grilled octopus. Â It is amazing. Â Now stop reading the reviews and book a reservation, you will not be disappointed."
"As someone who doesn't have the foresight to plan 2 months in advance for a dinner with friends, I did not secure a reservation to Girl & The Goat. However, rest assured that it's still possible to eat here without a reservation if you are willing to do bar/lounge seating and willing to come right when they open. We arrived at 4:30pm on a Sunday evening (or er, late afternoon) and it was already packed! Fortunately though, we were able to grab the lounge area at the front for our party of 5. Tip: come early if you don't have a reservation!I could go over everything I had (which was a lot) but I'll just note some key highlights for me to keep it short (i.e., THIS IS WHAT YOU MUST GET!).- wood oven roasted pig face. One of the most memorable dishes I had. Pig face! It's very rich and flavorful and was my favorite non-dessert small plate.- crisp braised pork shank.- budino. bacon toffee . glazed pineapple . candied cashews. our party of 5 ordered 3 of these, nothing else. 'Nuff said.Overall this was a great dining experience. We ordered tons of food and nothing here disappointed."
"We stopped in for appetizers and a glass of wine and were very much pleased with everything, especially the Cauliflower dish. Â The Jack O Lantern Bread also was quite good, as were the Chick Pea Fritters, Beets and Green Beans in a fish sauce."
"We had a good experience here, though we had to make reservations months in advance. The wait staff was very attentive. Our waiter asked about allergies, which I considered very thoughtful. I don't like onions so he pointed out some dishes to avoid. Very personalized. We started with some rosemary bread. It was ok. Our scallops came out next and WOW were they amazing. They were paired with some roasted Brussels sprouts. Mmmmmmmm. We had some peppers as well. They give you a lot of them, so we weren't able to finish the whole dish. Just when I was thinking about needing a new plate, the server brought us some. Good job. Next we had the goat belly with crab and lobster. Get the ham frites and dip them in the butter sauce. So delicious.Dessert was a split decision, so the semi-sweet chocolate and the butterscotch dishes were in order. Great way to top off the evening."
"Hard to get a decent time reservation without planning well in advance, but sooo worth it! Â Super unique small plates, so delicious. Â Cool atmosphere as well. Â Yum!"
"All the hype set my expectations hgh for Girl & the Goat. I can only assume, based on all the rave reviews, that our experience was out of the ordinary. Service was TERRIBLE; 15 minutes for the server to make first contact with our table, 10 more minutes for her to return to take drink orders, 10 minutes to come back to take food order, 40 min after being seated, we had drinks. Server seemed unfamiliar with the wine menu and haphazardly recommended the most expensive bottle available. The sommelier served the wine, so I was further confused as to why he had not been available to explain the wine selection from the beginning. The food was simply OK; certainly not what I had expected by the amazing reviews and hefty price tag. The Hamachi Crudo was great; albeit a very small portion. The wood fire scallops were delicious and perfectly cooked, but only 2 scallops per order. The music selection, a mix mash of pop, classic rock, and 90's alternative in combination with odd decor nuances, godawful girl and goat painting with glitter and skulls, Â ultimately Â the aesthetics of the restaurant Â lack cohesion and a clear point of view.The food runners were fast, friendly, and informative, the manager was friendly and apologetic for our less than acceptable server, but the poor service and lackluster food do not make a me jump at another opportunity for a dining experience at Girl & the Goat."
"It's exciting to indulge in a meal that lives up to the hype, the wait, the aura of fulton's market. I've been here thrice. Â Each time just as good as the last. Â I keep Girl & The Goat as my official ""Extraordinary treat to myself and loved ones"" here in Chicago."
"Will you marry me Stephanie Izard? That is defintely one of the top 5 restaurants I've ever eaten at in my entire life.. look through my reviews and I've visited tons of places. I didn't really think much when I was about to have dinner here on my 2nd night in Chicago. A very busy Thursday night here and we were seated 10 min after we arrived. We were seated right under the Girl and the Goat painting. The menu separated from Veggies, Fish, and Meats. We weren't sure what to do so we went with our server's recommendations. We ordered the Pig face, pork shank, green beans, goat leg and two dessert dishes. And blown away we were.Pig Face - It sounds disgusting but it tastes wonderful. Full of surprises and a lot of body to the taste of the food. The egg on top covers the pig face but when you mix it up and get your first bite..everyone begins fighting for more.Green beans - Typically I hate green beans but this one is sauced up so well that I fell in love. Goat leg - damn goat is so good! You can't go wrong here seriously..Pork Shank - with the naan bread that it comes with you are biting into this bread like no tomorrow. The pork is so tender and flavorful. The presentation is okay but the taste is something else. The dessert dishes.. one more fruity and the other chocolatey.. I forgot what it was called but damn!!! Recommendation: Order the whole damn menu.. Stephanie Izard put together a masterpiece of foods"
Made reservations about a month and a half in advance and the wait was definitely worthwhile. Started off with the Pig face and goat empanadas. Pig face was Cooked perfect with a nice crunchy texture. The empanadas were also different and tasty. Scallops were so so (not a big scallopsf an) and the cauliflower was really good as well. Def worth all the hype. Very cool atmosphere and moderate prices.
Some friends and I were visiting Chicago and made a reservation at the girl and the goat. I'm so glad we did. It was one of the best meals I've ever had. The restaurant is modern and very open. It was pretty busy and lively on a Monday night. We ordered 6 dishes between the three of us and it was plenty. Our favorite was the wood oven roasted pig face. It was so good we ordered another one immediately after. SautÃ©ed green beans and beef ribs were very delicious as well. Book your reservation early! It's a must try if you are visiting Chicago. I can't wait to go back!
"This is one of my favorite places to eat in the city and I consider myself blessed to live within walking distance of the place... Because, apparently it is difficult if not impossible to get a prime time reservation at this place. I'm rarely able to plan weeks or months ahead of time for dinner reservations, so when the mood strikes me, I just walk over. If I'm lucky, I'm seated, if it's not too bad I find a spot at the bar and wait (or eat there), and if it's unforgivingly busy, I walk back home and try my luck another day.With that being said, the menu is all delicious and inspired with a fusion of flavors in each dish. My usual favorites include the grilled baby octopus, crisp braised pork shank (with naan and a creamy kimchee sauce... Omg) and the sautÃ©ed green beans. The servings tend to be on the smaller side with the intention of being shared tapas-style. It is a similar concept to Purple Pig also, in the downtown area. My advice is go with a couple of friends and order different inks so that everyone can try all the awesomeness the menu has to offer.And every good meal needs a good beverage to accompany... They have a full bar with a short list of craft beers and the cocktail drinks are all strong and expertly prepared by the mixologist bartenders. The decor is trendy with a conversational ambiance. There is a modern rustic look to the place which I love. There are plenty of couches to sit on while waiting for a table with cocktail service. The bar is beautifully set up and the kitchen is set up so that you can get a peek at the magic going on behind the scenes. Worst case scenario, you don't have a rezzie and the place is packed... You can always go across the street to their sister restaurant, Little Goat, or check out the tons of other fabulous restaurants on Randolph St.Bottom line: Make a reservation. Take some friends. Order a lot. Enjoy your night. You won't regret it."
"We were lucky to score a first-come, first-serve table at Girl & The Goat attached to the bar. Â Our waitress was very patient as we scoured the menu for dishes that worked for everyone in the party. Â We got the following:Pan fried shishito peppers Wood grilled broccoli(They were out of the chickpea fritters)Goat EmapanadasConfit Goat BellyDiver ScallopsEscargot RavioliCharred Pork BellyCrisp Braised Pork ShankWood Fired ChickenHighlights were the broccoli, empanadas, diver scallops, ravioli, and pork shank. Â Good lord the pork shank was good. Â They also had a few really good draught beer selections. Â The reasons for a 4-star instead of 5 would be the chicken was a little dry, they ran out of the fritters, and I can't say I remember the goat belly (I was a little tuned up I guess).Definitely go here if you get an opportunity!"
Loved it! The good was terrific and we got there right when they opened and they squeezed 5 of us in no reservation at all on Saturday ! Can't wait to go back again
"We made our reservation like a month in advance!! We had a big group of I think 12 people. They don't seat you until your entire party arrives, so we had to wait a bit. Nbd. Drinks while we wait. First of all, come with an open mind!!!! I could very well be one of the pickiest people, but I'm learning to try new things. Try it once at least, then you can say you don't like it. But the food at Girl & the goat may make you reconsider what you do and don't like. Pig face - When I heard pig face the first time, I was like f no! that sounds terrible! They don't actually bring you a pig's face. At least not intact. It was good! I'm still a little reluctant to admit that but it was. Sauteed green beans - loved it. baby octopus - tried that for the first time as well. some pieces were chewy and others were soft. roasted cauliflower - this one is a MUST HAVE! Chickpea fritters - it tasted like tofu... I'd probably pass on this one if I came back."
"yes. perfect. everything was delicious, service was amazing. i wish i lived in chicago so i could come here all the time. the halibut was perhaps the best thing i've ever eaten. portion sizes were actually bigger than anticipated."
"Finally made it to Girl & the Goat on our most recent trip to Chicago and it was 100% worth the wait of being unable to snag a reservation in years past. Hands down, it was one of the best meals I've ever had from start to finish.We completely lucked out and were seated at a two-person spot facing the kitchen, right next to the expo line where Stephanie herself was running the show. Watching the food being prepared and sent out was one of the best parts of the night, largely because it was just so much fun to watch the staff do what they do so well. Our server, Hunter, was super friendly and seemed really excited to give us his recommendations of favorite menu items.Our food was timed perfectly. We started with the honey sambal brioche (I had to refrain from eating the honey butter straight at one point) and wood fired oysters (I'm not a huge oyster fan, but my husband said they were great). The cauliflower was absolutely out of this world (the mint!), to the point where we were both still talking about it the next day on our long drive back to Ohio Â (""Y'know what I could go for right now? A bowl of that cauliflower...""). We had debated between that and the pan fried shishito peppers for our vegetable dish, so we were thrilled when one of our new chef friends fired us up a mini bowl of them and slid them across the counter with his compliments. They were equally delicious, and we decided that the vegetable dishes might have been the two best that we ate all night. We also tried the crispy beef short ribs (the grapefruit was subtle, but such a great addition) and the pig face (because how often can you say you ate pig face?) and loved those as well. Dessert included the miso-butterscotch budino as well as another complimentary dish, some sort of blueberry cake (the fact that I can't really remember what it was doesn't mean it wasn't delicious, I think this is when my food coma really set in...).We had such a great experience here, totally agree that this is a must when visiting Chicago!"
"Over.Rated.I went there for my birthday with some friends. Â While a few dishes were stand-out yummy (like the pig's face - one of the best things I have ever eaten) - the portions were so ridiculously small and overpriced it was a joke. Â Drinks were tiny and weak. Â I mean, for 13 bucks I want to be knocked out of my chair with the alcohol, LOL. Â Our server was very good, but while we were in the bar area, some of the servers came off as very snooty and pretentious Â Don't do me any small favors by bringing me a menu, sheesh.Overall, while I loooved the pig's face, not sure I would go again. Â Maybe if I hit the lottery and can afford to spend 100 dollars on a meal - cause that is practically what it would cost to get full off those portions."
"Quite possibly the best dining experience I've had since being in Chicago =)I was lucky enough on a Thursday to get reservations for the next Friday evening at 8PM! Got there and they sat us at the best seats in the house, right where the kitchen is at the chef's table! We got to watch where all the action takes place :DFood was AMAZING!! Tapas style, everything is to be shared :) There's the appetizer menu which has different types of breads, oysters and goat. The main menu has 3 sections: V (veggies), F (fish) and M (meat). Duh. Also a drink menu with a few good cocktails and beer selection. What we ordered and got to try:Fried Naked Cowboy Oysters - not bad, it reminded me of deviled eggs in oyster Â form, nicely breaded with a creamy sauce.Beets Salad - was delicious! Everything in the salad mixed beautifully together with the beets. Drool.Green Beans - i LOVE green beans! And this simple dish was yummy! may be a bit saltier than I'd like but it was GREEN BEAN PERFECT! And the tasty sauce they drizzle on top had a great creamy/spicy kick to it. Diver Scallops - Cooked perfectly! Loved the texture of the scallop and the flavor.Escargot Ravioli - first time eating snails. It wasn't as chewy as I expected and it wasn't rubbery too. Reminded me of squid/octopus all inside of a ravioli. Not bad at all and the ravioli sauce was good, not too heavy.Confit Goat Belly - tastes a lot like pork belly, but sweeter and not as salty. Great dish to try if you want to try goat =) Â comes with lobster/crab meat, all so yummy!!Pig Face - didn't taste like face, not that I know what face tastes like. It did taste like short rib to me. Be sure to mixed everything all up before eating! It tastes good that way, especially with the crunchy potato stix and the egg yolk. Lastly, dessert!! Butterscotch budino, butterscotch pudding, cake, whipped cream, candied pineapple, cashews,crunchy bacon-toffee pieces. Holy moly it was fantastic!! Loved every bite of it. Made me melt..yummmm!Everything was amazing about this place! The people cooking behind the counter and everything we tasted, loved every moment of it. Seriously, I can't wait to go back!! Really recommend this place to anyone visiting Chicago!"
"Took the time to find the reservations for my boyfriends birthday a few months in advance. Glad I did, this is a restaurant he has been wanting to visit, and cross off the list. We arrived early, and the place was crowded - expected, but I was excited and it was a friendly and energetic ambiance. We checked in and figured it wouldn't hurt to ask about the chef's table. The hostess was nice and gave us a time measurement, and regularly checked in with us. We waited a bit longer than we wanted, but it was totally worth it. As soon as we sat, our waiter arrived - Brennan who was just wonderful. So very wonderful. We started with drinks, eagerly looked through the menu, and asked the advice of the chefs in front of us. WHAT A VIEW!!! We decided upon the oysters, the confit goat belly, the green beans (easily my favorite), baby octopus, and the crispy pig face. The pig face is a must! It is crispy, fatty, deliciousness that just melts in your mouth! Our waiter brought over some empanadas - because we JUST had to try them. We ended the night with the bittersweet chocolate cake things with shitake - carmel gelato. It makes no sense, but its delicious. I'm tempted to start looking for another reservation now just so I can return in a few months when the menu is different because of seasonal change! Love this place, wish I could be a regular."
"It's my Birthday! That really has nothing to do with this review, I just thought y'all would like to know. Okay, maybe it has a little to do with my birthday. You see, I had originally made reservations for G&G back in 2010 for March 30th, 2011. My reservation was later cancelled for an unknown private event that they were hosting on that date after my reservation had been taken only by mistake. I worked at a restaurant at the time and though I felt a little sour, I understand how mistakes can happen. Plus I drove by on the night of my B-Day last and found out that the secret private event was the Top Chef finale.... Okay fine, I guess that might be a little more high profile than little ole me... and it only took another year before it all ended up working out. Yesterday I was treated to one of the nicest dining experiences I've had in a long time (Thx, Mark S!). Coming from a serving/bartending background, I always appreciate when servers look comfortable at work- ie, super cute goat guy on a thin black tee and jeans. They basically had me at their uniforms, which are pretty damn similar to my everyday attire of a bunch of stuff with animals on it, and nothing to fancy schmancy. The food on the other hand... a little more dressed up. Like, I thought I looked nice until I saw what my dinner was wearing. Our server said that for 2 people 4-5 plates is usually plenty... so naturally, we went with 6... and a dessert. Here's the birthday run down:- Fresh baked bread with coffee spread = whoa. Whoa-ho-ho. Unbelievable. Eating this reminded me of Halloween time and seeing one of your friends in a costume where you might see them everyday in regular life but in costume they're barely recognizable... and they look so good you can't stop staring and creep them out. It's like that. How could this taste so much like coffee and not like bread or artificial coffee flavoring and why can't I take my mouth of it? And then I start creeping out other diners with my enthusiasm for eating it. By far, my favorite item of the night... and I don't really even like bread. - Fresh baked maize bread with avocado yogurt... Daaamn is all you need to know. - The famous cauliflower: Parm cheezy and delish. I preferred the bottom bits without the cheese and with the mint leaves, but my cauliflower hatin' counterpart LOVED the cheese and scarfed his portion down and then some with jubilant fervor. - Warm marinated olives. Whodathunk olives would taste even better warm? I guess they work on the same level as salted nuts. You MUST get an order of these bad boys to munch on throughout your meal. Plus, a million of them come in an order so it's a nice little time sucker... and they don't forget to provide you with a little pot for the pits so you don't end up with a plate full of spitty, gnawed on pits. - Roasted beet salad with crunchy-ness and green bean biz-nast. Okay, obvi that's not what it was actually called but I've been working a lot and sleeping a little so my mind was in a bit of a daze but what I liked about this beet salad, as the world's biggest beet fan, is that it wasn't a bunch of mixed greens with a few beet bits- it was 100% Beet by volume and only had a light sprinkling of mixed greens on top for color. Just beet it? Don't mind if I do. - Artichoke... something? I dunno. I just glanced at the menu quickly and when I saw olives, beets, and artichokes (3 of my top 5 favorite foods) I know which plates would be called upon. If I had to describe the artichoke dish I'd say it was like a pasta that looked like individually wrapped candy packets filled with nutty goodness. Hehe... she said 'nutty goodness.'To be honest, I didn't really read the full description of anything I ordered. There was so much going on as far as atmosphere and the best playlist ever! Seriously, I think I looked around and at some point in the night, I'm pretty sure every person in there had uttered the word's 'it's like I made this playlist""... sure you did, buddy. I was thinking the same thing about myself and then while I was looking around I realized that though I LOVED every song, I'm just not nearly cool enough to be able to devise a playlist of that magnitude. It was a scene alright, but still cool enough that you can pull a mix of really dressed up people to really casual peeps and still have everyone feeling comfortable. Then again, it's dark and loud as f*ck so everyone seems about the same level when you've got those two things going. And I probably don't have to mention this but I will anyway- the beer list was quality, my Tequila Fleur got my kulo buzzed, and our server was a God damned peach if I've ever seen one. It would take a plague of epic proportions to keep this (now 1 year older) Miss away from G&theG for too long. In fact, I actually logged onto Yelp and made my OpenTable reservation while I was only 2 plates into dinner at GG. I'll see you in 3 more months when I celebrate my 2_ and a quarter birthday."
"Got a seat at the bar and ordered the trout, escargot and chocolate dessert. Trout was awesome, escargot was just a check mark off of my bucket list - tasted like a chewy mushroom."
"I have a serious crush on chef Stephanie Izard, but I gotta say that I've experienced better than Girl & the Goat from both her and many other restaurants. Maybe it's her focus on her national food truck tour or the galloping success of the Little Goat, but Girl & The Goat isn't an obvious reflection of awesome.We went again last night and were seated in the same section as before (by the windows) where it is cold. We had the same server who worked like a wind-up toy on crack (all smiles but impersonal, jerky movements, and an uncanny knack at recitation). His steam must have started to run out partway through dinner because he checked on us less. My friend commented that they could have flipped our table much faster if he checked on us more, brought us the dessert menu, and served us faster. And it seemed obvious they were in the business of flipping tables as the hostesses came by with clip boards taking notes on the status of all of the dining guests.We thought the food was not nearly as mind-blowing as our first time. Once again, I thought everything was extremely salty. It was a lot harder to taste all of the flavor layers for which Stephanie Izard is renowned. My sister (who would salt her salt) loved everything except for the cauliflower. I would say the best things we had were:- bread- ham frites- pig face- pork bellyOh - and of course my cocktails.I am planning to go again in a few months. I made that reservation for a party of ten. I expected to give my debit/credit card number to secure the reservation but I was upset when they emailed me an authorization form to complete and sign. The authorization form says that I will pay $35/person if we don't show up or if we cancel within 48 hours of our reservation. There was something about having to sign a form and having to pay $350 for a no-show/late-cancellation that I found to be extremely off-putting.It's nice that Girl & the Goat is so popular, but now I think that it's over-rated. There are many other restaurants that have better food and have more genuine service (i.e. The Little Goat)."
Everything on the menu will excite and improve your food experience. The crispy cod to pig face to goat belly to date cake ... You have to try everything. Recommend big groups for sharing. That's the duck tongues
"Amazing. Make reservations, go with a large group, and try everything. My absolute favorite was the trout dish. It was delectable!"
"First time here and I am really disappointed. Â As soon as you enter the scent of swine suffocates you from the kitchen. The chef is obsessed with adding pork to appetizers, Â seafood, and the few goat items they have on the menu. Â The scallops and octopus I ordered had to be made with no bacon. The scallops were chopped into tiny pieces and were quite good, but won't make you come back for them. Avoid the octopus! What was pretty good was the roasted duck breast. That was really delicious. My clothes still reek of the swine and I don't think I can go there again."
"Some of the food tasted great and the portions were small. I left there a little hungry. It's around a 100.00 a person when you put it all together. We had several vegetables dishes and they seemed a bit salty. The place was crowded and the volume level was high. We had a infant.... My niece. Not good for families with young children. Glad to experience it but it's not ""the best"" I have experienced. If your coming to Chicago and want to go with the hype then this is the place for you. :-)"
One thing: Wood Fired Walter's Chicken. PERIOD. It will give you life. So delicious that I could've eaten my fingers with it.
"The hype is warranted. Called months and months in advance for a summer Saturday night to celebrate our 10th anniversary with friends. We'd gone to Tru the prior evening so it had a lot to compete with, but we very much enjoyed our meal at G&TG even more. Everything we ate was delicious, fun atmosphere, seated immediately at our reservation time. Great evening."
Fantastic food! Started with the sauteed Green Beans and it just got better from there. It was a taste explosion. Highly recommend this restaurant. Hard to get a seat. You will have to wait for 1-2 hours. We ended up sitting at the bar which was also fine for us.
"I've been to this restaurant a few times. Â In all instances, I feel that there are some really great highlights and then there are some points about the experience which are simple, ""EH"". Â Nothing can be said that is particularly ""bad"" or horrible about the restaurant. Â The food has always tasted great, the service is really spot on even when they are slammed with customers (which usually is the case). Â The last couple of times we were there, I was really surprised that they didn't have the entire goat leg which is offered on their menu. Â The first time this happened all of us in our group were a bit bummed out, but we made the best of it and order other things off the menu, all of which were really great. Â The second time we went as a group, we tried to order the entire goat leg since we had enough members in our group to handle a meal that large. Â Once again, they didn't have it. Â It was on this second visit that the waiter explained that in order to ensure that we'd have our goat leg ready to order, we'd have to have ordered it at least a day in advance and preferably two. Â I was kind of surprised about this considering that goat meat is in a good portion of their menu items. Â One would thing that having goat as one of the main ingredients and which is also part of the name of the business, that at the very least, you'd have the very item that you say you specialize in?!?! Â Anyway, our group took the disappointing news in stride and just ordered other items off the menu. Â All of which was pretty good."
"One of the best restaurants I've been to in the US. Incredible service, awesome ambiance, spectacular dishes and great flavor combinations.Some of the most unexpected or unfathomable dishes are also the mist memorable. The duck tongues are fried to crisp perfection and served with a generous portion of delicate tuna sashimi. The piri piri sauce at the bottom elevates the dish to a multilayered masterpiece. The beef heart is marinated and grilled over an open fire, soft on the inside and crispy on the outside, almost reminiscent of octopus. Even the applecheese bread, where little chunks of apple are the exact color and texture of the bread dough, was extremely memorable.Amongst the desserts, the best was a sort of chocolate brownie served with a shiitake mushroom ice cream. It is as unimaginable as it is delicious.Of the many marvelous restaurants in Chicago, Girl and the Goat still stands out as one of the most memorable, experimental and downright fun. Also helped that we were seated at the two stools right in front of the kitchen, chatting with the super friendly chefs and seeing all our dishes be meticulously put together. Our clothes might smell a bit like everything on top of the restaurant's blazing stovetops, but I still wouldn't replace our front-row spots with any other restaurant seats."
"we snagged a 4:30 reservation super last minute on a weekday and were seated in the best seat in the house, right in front of the kitchen. our server was AMAZING, i forgot his name but we ended up eating an extra three plates that were served on the house so we basically needed to be wheeled outta there. we ordered the one of the breads, beet salad, grilled baby octopus, pig face, goat shank, and ended up with three more items including goat empanadas, the roasted cauliflower and a creamy peach dessert. i really can't put into words how delicious everything was so i will leave it up to other yelpers to try it!by far THE BEST dining experience i have had in chicago!"
"Living in Chicago and being a huge Top chef fan,I had to check this place out. Now,after dining here 15 plus times I have to say that I never get bored of it.Food is very creative, the ambiance is great,the cocktails are fantastic. We definitely drag all of our out of town friends to Girl and a goat and so far,we had nothing but positive feedback."
What an Amazing experience!! From the beginning to the end!! Seated in less than two minutes without a reservation and we were treated like royalty! If I lived in Chicago I would be here every other day!
"This is one of the toughest Yelp reviews I've ever had to write. I had been looking forward to dining at Girl & The Goat for months and the food ended up being extremely disappointing. The only thing that saved our experience was the way that the staff handled our complaints. I have so much respect and appreciation for the manager and our waiter the night we dined here because they really made a difference in our dining experience.After months of waiting, my boyfriend finally scored a dinner reservation and we came for my 30th birthday on Saturday night. We ordered several dishes on the menu and each can only be described as SALTY. I do not consider myself ""salt sensitive"" and I can appreciate salty foods. I expected that many of the dishes we ordered would be salty due to the ingredients but everything was so overly salty that everyone at the table felt sick by the end of the evening.To be fair, we knew the roasted beets contained anchovies and the sauteed green beans contained fish sauce. I get that the dishes should be salty but we could not finish even one of these dishes between three people. Each dish ordered after these two should not have been salty but the roasted cauliflower, pan roasted arctic char and pork belly tasted extremely salty. At this point, my boyfriend brought up the issue with our awesome waiter, Brennan. He seemed surprised that we weren't enjoying our meal and couldn't finish any of the dishes we had up to that point and let the manager know. Aaron, the manager, immediately apologized to our entire table and said he would take care of everything. The chefs were advised to go easy on the salt for our final two dishes, the confit goat belly and the pig face. The pig face was delicious, perfectly crisp and seasoned just the right amount. I wish I could have enjoyed it more but by this point, I was already feeling sick from the previous dishes. The miso-butterscotch budino was wonderful as well.Throughout the rest of our meal, our waiter continued to check on us and make sure we were enjoying our food. He was genuinely hurt that we didn't enjoy the food and assured us that Stephanie Izard herself would be speaking to the chefs the next day she returned to the restaurant. The manager even took care of our food bill because we were unable to finish any of our dishes.I'm unsure about giving Girl & The Goat a second chance but will definitely try to keep an open mind. I really appreciate how the staff here are so passionate about the quality of the food and making sure everyone enjoys it."
"I ate at Girl and the Goat while visiting Chicago for work. The food was amazing and the restaurant is very comfortable. There's communal seating, so be aware of that if you're going and that's not your thing. The goat sausage is delicious and the chickpea fritters and the goat empanadas. Everything was great, but I'd recommend those. I also have some pretty strange food allergies and these guys were incredibly helpful. Our server worked with the kitchen and made at least 7 different alterations so that I wouldn't have to worry about things I can't eat. I've never seen any other restaurant be so accommodating. Definitely will go back next time I'm in town."
"Vegan menu?! Â Dairy free menu?! Â Waitress that is totally respectful of what I am willing to and not willing to eat?! Â FINALLY, a popular/trendy/foodie establishment that truly likes my money! Oh, and the wood grilled broccoli was the best broccoli I have ever had. Â The octopus ""sans butter and dairy"" (as proclaimed by the server as she set down the plate) was incredible! Â Thank you. Â A thousand times THANK YOU!!!"
"This place is delicious!!! Â We went in a group of 6 and ordered together so we could get a taste of everything. Â We all picked 2 items off of the menu to share and it was the perfect amount. Â The highlights for me were the pig face, the pork shank, and surprisingly the roasted cauliflower. Â The cauliflower has mint and pine nuts and it is one of the best sides I have had in quite a while. Â This is a great place to take tourists in town for a visit or to enjoy with a group of friends."
"I've been a huge Top Chef fan since the very start and of course, I was impressed with Stephanie's cooking on the show (but let's be honest, didn't we all think Richard Blais was going to win that season? But I digress...)I couldn't get a reservation to Girl & the Goat the last time I went to Chicago so I made sure that I would get in this time around. Unfortunately, we had a 4:45 reservation and I had to be at the airport by 6:15 for my 7pm flight so we had a speed-dining experience. Everything is a little muddled my in mind since we didn't have any time to talk and barely enough time to chew and swallow but here is what I do remember:-In general, the flavors were really bold; almost a bit overboard. You really need some bread or some sort of palette cleanser between courses.-The roasted beet salad was good but I've had better in LA.-The sugo with pappadelle was delicious but not very ""special""-The highlight dish was the pig face-The confit goat belly was tiny and I wasn't quite sure why it needed so much lobster. Of course, it was rich and delicious.-The onion bread was incredibly yummy. It may have been the best part of the meal.-Our waitress was super accommodating and made sure we were fed quickly.-We didn't order drinks and the meal for 4 was $150; that's pretty fair.-I made it to the airport with plenty of time to spare."
"Loved this place so much, one of my favorite meals!! My boyfriend and I came here with serious appetites. We ordered over 10 dishes to share to try as much as possible and I have to say just about every one was on point. A lot of variety. Everything on the menu sounds (and is) awesome. Creative (not too creative) flavor combinations. Great service and cool atmosphere (open kitchen). Stephanie came out to say hello and was really nice. Good beer selection. I'd go back here in a heartbeat which I don't say very often. Go here!!!"
"Hellllllo, life changing.Thankfully, I'm not referring to one of my BFF's turning 30. Â (For those of you that are curious, there were no tears shed at the dinner table. Â Surprisingly.) Â My meal at Girl and the Goat was phenomenal....and probably one of the best meals I've ever had. Â I'm still raving about it to people weeks later. The birthday girl decided to order enough food for like 8 people (as opposed to 5), but that was cool with us as we got to try everything. Â The dilly here is that you're supposed to share plates, so make sure you come with people that you actually like...or else this meal could get awkward. Â All the dishes were beyond delicious, but my three favorites were the pig face, goat empanadas and the scallops. But, honestly? Â Pig face. Â Amazing. Â For as popular as this place is, the atmosphere is so NOT pretentious. Â Employees are extremely friendly, knowledgeable and accommodating. Â One of my friends is on a tragic gluten free diet and was afraid she could eat nothing on the menu. Â However, our waitress was super helpful in explaining what she could/could not eat. Â My friend was ecstatic, to say the least. Â  It now makes complete sense why these reservations are hard to come by. Plan ahead, people -- it's SO worth it. Â And, if you can only score a 10:15 reservation...on a Wednesday night...the day before a major meeting, TAKE IT. Â It'll be the best decision you've ever made."
"G&GT is a tapas style restaurant, so order three dishes per person. We waited 30min over the 1.2hr estimated wait. When we were being seated we were asked to finish up in 1.5hrs so the table can be ready for a reservation. Ordered Country sour bread which was a brick but the hummus was good. Hamachi and scallop dishes were great! We also ordered the pork shank. It was good but not great. I felt the grease on my lips for the rest of the night. Overall this is place over hyped! Would not come here again (even if there was no wait)."
"I have been drooling over Girl and The Goat for years now, sadly, I live in California so it has not been anything more than something I could hope for someday. I will admit right now that Stephanie Izard was my all time favorite contestant on Top Chef, I have no shame in my reality TV game. Her food always succeeded in making me long to try it even without smell or taste as a conduit. Just the look and descriptions had me going crazy. Plus, I just really admired the way she conducted herself and saw her as a real inspiration in the typically male dominated chef world. I mean, I love me some Anthony Bourdain as much as anyone, but I have to support my sisters. I did go to a women's college afterall. Anyway, my husband wanted to go home to Indiana for Thanksgiving as our only vacation this year, so I managed to talk him into a few days in Chicago beforehand. Of course, I wanted to take my kids to all the tourist sites, but the thing I was most focused on was getting to Girl and the Goat! The ONLY reservation I could wrangle a couple months in advance was at 4:30pm for 2 on a Monday night. I knew my mother would appreciate the food more than my husband, who labels bok choy an ""esoteric vegetable"", so I left him at the hotel with the boys. Book your visit early. I was almost foiled when upon leaving The Museum of Science and Industry at 10 minutes to 4 we got held up by a police road closure as no fewer than 22 cop cars whizzed by. When we finally got back on the road we had less than 20 minutes to get to the restaurant and traffic was slow. I was getting worried and called the restaurant to let them know. They were super friendly and understanding and put a note in the book to hold the reservation. We ended up 20 minutes late, but since it was early it wasn't too much of a problem. It was definitely busy, but nowhere near as packed as when we left at almost 7. Immediately I loved the restaurant, cozy with lots of dark wood, glowing lights, exposed brick and quirky art. Just my style. We were seated quickly and our heavy coats checked for us. Our waitress greeted us right away and let us know that she would be there to answer any of our questions. She was friendly and professional but with just the right amount of warmth and casual grace to make you feel right at home. My mom and I figured since we were taking cabs the rest of the night we could split a bottle of wine, so we went with a sparkling brut rose from Spain that was just delicious and paired well with everything. Everything is served here basically tapas style and our waitress suggested four to five dishes to split between the two of us. We were not super hungry and wanted dessert too so we decided to start with three plus bread and see how we felt from there. Everything is split into vegetable, meat and seafood and the menu changes daily and with the seasons. They also have a side menu of goat specialties. They have several dishes that even I would label ""esoteric"" like pig face. I was not brave enough to order those, maybe if this was a local restaurant for me I would come back and explore a little. Ah, I wish! We ended up ordering the homemade bread (they have Goat Bread just down the street) with pumpkin puree and chipotle butter (OMG! Heaven! My mom and I could have eaten that bread and toppings for days, but we love our carbs even if they don't love us.), squash dumplings (good, but not my favorite), scallops (to die for) and skirt steak (perfectly cooked, melt in your mouth). We loved every bite of everything we had, just a superlative dining experience. We finished off with the bittersweet chocolate cake with the innovative shiitake caramel gelato. I loved it too, but my mom was not too fond of one of the flavors, probably the shiitake. She didn't mind letting me finish as she was stuffed anyway. Three plates plus bread and dessert ended up being perfect for us, but like I said we were not super hungry, so you may need more. Surprisingly our bill ended up being way less than I had feared when I originally booked this restaurant. Â The bathrooms are located downstairs and are also pretty interesting (four cute little individual unisex rooms), make sure you check out some of Chef Izard's James Beard Awards and other accolades on the landing at the bottom. As we waited for our coats near the front door I surveyed the buzzing kitchen in the back, where there is a dining bar you could eat at and watch the chefs' artistry. I was impressed that there were no less than five female chefs amongst their ranks. Overall I was just thrilled I got to come here and try this amazing food and can only dream of returning someday."
"Um... Amazing. Â Well designedWe'll runClassyRespectfulEdgyDeliciousSexyBeautiful.Nuff said?Just go, you won't be disappointed in any level."
Oh my god I love this place! I have heard about it for thousands of time. The fries are good! But my FAVOR is the pig face! The waiter told us to make them as mess as we can. And we did a great job! Will come back again!
"""Girl & The Goat: Where the vegetables smell like meat!""Just kidding, sorta. As a mostly veggie, we ordered nearly everything off the veg side of the menu and it was delicious... and ""rustic"" smelling. Serving sizes were much larger than anticipated so we got to take home leftovers to enjoy a second night of G&G.Reading all the reviews about the lengthy reservations makes me believe that the stars aligned for us because we walked right in without a reservation around 8PM and were seated immediately. Â Granted, this was on a FRIGID Monday night on the week of Valentines day sooo great timing!"
"Wonderful atmosphere with great esthetics, very enjoyable staff and incredible dishes. You need a reservation as we've experienced variations of availability. This is a pretty packed establishment, but well worth it. Great start to an evening downtown."
"If the first 1300 reviews didn't sway your opinion...I'll toss a pebble into the pool, it's that good.Daphne L. procured reservations on a Sunday Funday, but we decided to forgo those and sit at the raised bar, which was great. The Lounge Area is always first come, first served, and we enjoyed the sight lines and the social aspect with other diners.Super Highlights:Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face- (see pic) this dish came with special instructions to break the fried egg and swirl all of the ingredients together. The meat was as tender as oxtail, and the dish was worth the visit alone!Grilled Pork Ribs- big meaty ribs with perfect seasoning, this was one of my choices, and it did not disappoint (and I've been all over in Memphis, trust me). Goat Carpaccio- Daphers' husband was eyeing the carpaccio on the menu, and it was a great choice. Who doesn't like a carpaccio? Very good.Escargot Ravioli- the last of our truly standout dishes was the Escargot Ravioli. The sauce was so good we didn't leave any behind. Dishes that did not blow me away:Chickpeas Fritters- were just okay. I had read so much about them, Â but they just seemed out of place at Girl & the Goat. Hiramasa Crudo- Fish! At a meat restaurant! This dish was good, but again, slightly out of place here. Sauteed Green Beans- My Facebook was blowin' up when I asked what I should order at GatG, and Green Beans was second only to the Pig Face. What? I'm a passable cook and I've learned how to saute green beans in coarse ground pepper, Â sea salt and lemon juice or a splash of white wine vinegar too! Nah, not that amazing.The drink menu is really stellar and the Firestone IPA paired well to cut through the meat and richness of the sauces. I forgot to mention our server on the Sunday night we were there, she was working the bar and lounge area, and was great! And others that brought dishes to us never did the dump and run, and everyone was so professional and friendly. Well, except maybe the slight cattiness from no less than four hostesses, that could probably be done away with. Everyone else was the tops!There, pebble thrown in the pool, now get yourself to Girl & the Goat!"
"Alright, first of all- NOMS. Second of all, NOM NOMs.Okay, so I went here for brunch recently and I was really shocked I hadn't written a review of it yet. This place is great-- the reviews really are all true. Dinner I think is actually less worth it than WEEKEND BRUNCH...So weekend brunch-- delicious grits? yes please. with an egg? moreso.Dinner is good but in my opinion, a little pricier than I want to go. The brunch though is great because I think you really do get more bang for your buck-- and the food is just as good. Prepare yourself for a wait though-- I went on a weekend and waited 1 hour 40 minutes at 10am. But... was it worth it? Meh...probably. One star off for waiting and pricing for dinner."
I made reservations here 3 months in advance of my Chicago trip because I have heard so many good things about this place.The food was really good- the goat empanadas were so good and decadent. The green beans so refreshing and addicting with the addition of fish sauce.I enjoyed my experience here and would recommend to anyone who visits Chicago to try this place. You will be so happy you did!
"We went this past weekend, and it was one of the best dining out experiences I've ever had. Â Not only was the food excellent, but our server made it her mission for us to have a great time. Â Everything was paced the right way, and they even gave us an extra dessert for our anniversary (which was amazing, by the way - the Thai basil chocolate brownie, I think it was called). Â I highly recommend going there; it definitely was worth the wait."
"I came here for my birthday a few weeks ago & was a tad disappointed. In their defense, they might've been having an off night. The ambiance was really nice, trendy, & just what I was expecting. That was probably the best part. We couldn't get a reservation until 9:30, & the server seemed like she was definitely ready to go home for the night. Most of us had never been there before, & she was pretty short with us & tried to sell us the most expensive things on the menu instead of what was good. We started with the bread which my friend was raving about. She had peanut butter & jelly dips when she went, so I was expecting something unique & delish. They change the dipping sauces with bread, and the night we went, they were totally boring- butter, garlic, tomato cream. We also got the pig face, which was good, & a couple different veggie options. The wood roasted broccoli tasted like it was doused in lighter fluid. Everything else was just okay. I hate to say it, but I really don't see what all the fuss is about when it comes to girl & the goat."
"I was so looking forward to this place for such a long time. My partner and I were spending a few days in Chicago from Dallas and are fans of Stephanie from Top Chef. The food definitely did not disappoint. The creativity in the dishes is superb and every dish that hit our table was award winning! Starting with my favorite: Â Pig Face, then the Trout, then the goat belly, the oysters, even the bread was phenomenal. Bravo on the food!Thank goodness for the food, because the service and environment was sub par. There was an air of snootiness all over the restaurant which was very off putting. Our waiter was cold and inattentive and couldn't care less about our experience. The chairs in the restaurant were the most uncomfortable I've sat in in quite a while and you're smashed up next to other diners. The waiter was almost insistent about how much food we were supposed to order, which we would've done anyway, but back off man. It was almost like, ""this is how much you need to order to make it worth my time to serve you."" At the end of the meal, he disappeared and we waited forever to see him again. Then he was put out that we didn't want dessert. And as we walked out of the restaurant, not one of the four people standing at the hostess stand thanked us for coming or even acknowledged our presence. No matter how good the food is, you always remember service that makes you feel unwanted. I enjoyed my experience way more across the street at Little Goat. The food was just as wonderful and the entire staff was so friendly.."
"My colleagues family dragged me to this place and the drag was very well worth it. The place is very unique IMO and we had a blast sharing plates of delicious food - from the very first piece of bread to the deserts I didn't really want to share - everything tasted GREAT!The place was as clean as any and met my requirements for that and the staff wasn't just knowledgeable on the menu - it was if they could read my mind and suggested exactly what I wanted.Though I think it is a bit more pricey then most places of similar menu and food selections - Stephanie made it worth the extra cents. I was amazed that she was able to come out and chat with us as busy as the place was, but I loved getting to know her a tad bit!We were walking around town so I am not sure about parking, but the place was mobbed so I assume parking isn't an issue. TIP - try as many different dishes as you can!"
"The stars aligned on Superbowl Sunday (RIP in peace, Denver Broncos) and I was finally able to come here. I love me some bar seating (second only to open kitchen seating) and that appears to be the only way to get food here without going through the whole reservation thing. Even with the Super Event though, the place filled up decently.Everything we ordered was good (bread, scallops) to great (green beans, cauliflower, chicken, drink). There were some timing/course hiccups but they went above and beyond to recompense us. Plus we were sitting at the bar, where service is usually less than good, but this was still one of the better experiences I've had. Anyway I appreciate the high standards they set for themselves.I suppose pricing is a tad expensive, but it's called Girl and the Goat, not Girl and the Goat for Really Cheap Prices. I suppose the pricing is on par with some of the other, similar restaurants in this category and seeing as we didn't have any duds, it might be worth the money.My only regret is that they seem to be busy all other days of the year, so there will probably not be a return visit until the next Superbowl. With some luck maybe it will be the Bears playing, so it'll be even less crowded."
A go-to for anyone living or visiting Chicago. Highly recommend the pig face and the green beans! The bread/butters are also really good.
"not worth the hype or the wait, Â waited 3 weeks for a reservation that was before 11PM. Â The atmosphere is too noisy and there is just too much confusion going on. Â Some of the dishes were good, others were average at best. Â they act as if they are feeding us for free. Â For the price and the attitude of the hosts there are far better places in chicago. Â Don't waste your time or your money with this place."
"This is a small plates restaurants, and between the 3 of us, we probably ordered about 8 dishes. Â The menu changes frequently, which makes it hard for me to remember what we got. Â There are a few dishes that I'd recommend: Â The roasted beet salad, the shisito peppers, the BREAD and mushroom spread, but my favorite was dessert. Â I had a peanut butter jelly doughnut dessert that I'll never forget. Â It was comprised of sugared doughnut holes, peanut butter ice cream or mousse, and grape granita, all topped with some crunchy sweet streusel. Â It's a popular restaurant, and packed and loud. Â The decor is very chic, with what seems like charred wood walls. Â Low lighting."
"Perfect perfect perfect meal. Â One of the all time best meals I have ever had. Â I enjoyed it more than Trotter's and more than any of the Michelin starred places I have eaten at in NYC. Â The things we enjoyed the most:The beer selection -- I hate beer, but once I tried what my bf ordered, I got the same for myself. Â Sugo -- delicious. Â The bf declared it the best thing he had ever eaten and ordered two additional servings to go.Mussels -- simply perfect. Â I've been on a huge mussel binge the last year and these made me want to weep with joy and never eat another mussel again unless it was here. Â Service -- attentive and very friendly. Â In a place like this, it would be so very easy for the servers to get snotty, but that isn't the case here. Â Icing on the cake! Â Things that did not meet our (admittedly overinflated) expectations:Pig Face Â -- partly due to food exhaustion. Â This was the last thing that came out and we just couldn't enjoy it. Â It was good, but not life-changing.Wood grilled broccoli -- I think my expectations were too high on this. Â Still good, but not something I'd order again.Bread with duck fat -- had high hopes for this, but it was the weakest thing we ordered and we would definitely skip it next time. Â How much did we like this place? Â After eating here, the bf and I decided that we didn't need to try Le Bernardin and Per Se in NYC and would rather save our money to fly back to Chicago and eat here again. Â I cannot recommend this place highly enough. Â Of everything I've given 5 stars here on yelp, this stands head and shoulders above them all."
"I'm going to be this person :( I didn't enjoy my meal very much. Everything was weirdly sour and the flavors were all oddly matched. I'm guessing we just ordered the wrong stuff because every other reviewer gave Girl & The Goat 5 stars. Also, my boy Anthony Bourdain came here, and he can do no wrong!!! I would recommend the bittersweet chocolate cake for dessert. The shiitake ice cream was pretty cool. I also felt like this place was suuuper pretentious. I dunno. I guess I'm just not fancy enough.."
Amazing food.
Girl & the Goat is worth all of the hype! Everything we had was amazing and the plates are meant for sharing! Our server was knowledgeable and made a lot of great recommendations. This restaurant is a great setting for any ocassion and I would recommend it to everyone!
"On a recent trip to Chicago, my husband and I, both vegan, dined at the Girl and the Goat. We were lucky enough to get a 6:45 PM reservation on a Monday night, and we liked atmosphere created by the high ceiling, the wooden table, and the dimmed lighting. We were impressed that the restaurant had a vegan menu, though most of the items on it are adaptations of non-vegan dishes.Here's what we had:. Tahini bread with hummus (we asked them to hold the tsaziki and the bread was still very good, although the hummus was just hummus)Kholrabi salad (also very good, subtle but very fresh)marinated olives (okay to good)shisito peppers in miso sauce (very good to excellent)vegetable tempura (the stuff on top made it excellent) smoky grilled broccoli with crispy rice (terrific!)The couple seated next to us told us that the broccoli was one of the signature dishes, normally served with blue cheese which was held off to veganize it. Another signature dish is the green beans with roasted onions and some kind of cheese -- this one we didn't have.For dessert the only vegan choice was blood orange sorbet (pretty good but not as wow as we were expecting). The server had told us it was a tapas style restaurant but the portions were larger than we expected, so we came out very, very full. The most amazing thing may have been the cost of the meal -- just $54 for all that food!This was at least a four and a half star dining experience for us, and we would happily go back if we are ever in Chicago again."
"If you can ever get the goat ribs, do it. I also had bacon and gouda bread with backfat butter and it was amazing. Sadly, the menu changes quite often and so it may no longer be available. The only bad item was the scallops, which were a little salty and a disappointment."
"My first time at girl & a goat and all I can say is WOW! Our server Emily was awesome and kept the meal roll along from one fabulous plate to the next. The portions were perfect for a taste of everything, because you will want to try everything. The most memorable meal I've had in a very long time. You always expect the first bite to be wonderful, but every plate was better than the last. We had the brioche, fried naked cowboys, raw oysters (OK we love our oysters), pig face (never had it before but it was unbelievable) and shortribs (had them before, this was one of if not the best preparation) and the budino. No words can describe the budino - I made noises like when Sally met Harry and had the tiramisu - wonder what she would have done with the budino? Two drinks each, tax tip and a fabulous meal for less than $100 a piece. I can't wait to go back."
"I went to girl and the goat a few days back for dinner and made reservations at 11pm on a Friday night. I arrived there an hour early thinking that I might get seated a little bit earlier than 11pm but NOPE. I waited for an hour and got seated around my reservation time. It didn't really bother me though since I had a bottle of wine and my boyfriend to accompany me in the waiting process :) But anyways! We got the wood oven roasted pig face, sautÃ©ed green bean and sugo. All their dishes were on the saltier side but it was pretty tasty! The pork meat for the wood oven roasted pig face was tender and juicy and the green beans were a little but on the greasier side but full of flavor. They do have a sister restaurant across the street from girl and the goat so I guess if the wait is too long here, try there? Overall, the waitress/waiters were really nice and I had an enjoyable experience here:)"
Love this place! Every month I am there to see whats new.
"WOW!This is one of the best dining experiences we have had!The place is big and hip and neat. It reminded us of Searsucker in San DiegoWe arrived a little early for an 8pm reservation, and went to the bar. Despite being very busy, the bartenders were friendly and informative, unlike our experience at Avec earlier. We had an Old Fashioned which was prepared traditionally and the Bolt Action. Both were delicious! We were then greeted by a very friendly hostess who asked if we would like to sit at the prime table facing the kitchen. We said absolutely! What a great way to dine! We watched the amazing chefs rapidly and skillfully preparing incredible dishes! Micah was so friendly and she answered all of our food questions while working.We had a bottle of Girl and The Goat Petit Verdot from Walla Walla, which was delicious and priced reasonably.The food was simply amazing. Watching it being prepared right in front of us was a bonus! We had the duck tongue to start and it was delicious. Served with fried won tons added a nice contrast. The Â green beans are a must and the spicy drizzle gave such a great kick to them. Next we had the pig face! As all of the reviews have stated it is truly amazing. Basically a jowl prepared oven roasted with a sunny side up egg on top. As all of the reviews have stated this dish is amazing. Perhaps the best single dish we have had anywhere. We were then treated by the chefs by a scallop, prepared perfectly. Finally we had the empanadas. The were delicious. Empanadas are often too dry if not prepared well, but these were perfect and quite tasty. I cannot wait to go back!!"
"Why I love Chicago: non-godzillionaires can get amazing gourmet food in a non-pretentious environment. Â White GATG is pricier than our normal fare, considering the food quality and notoriety, I found it quite reasonable. It cost about $100 to split 5 dishes and have 1 beer each.We started with the roasted beet salad with avocado creme fraiche. Â Then seared scallops, they were juicy and the sear was perfect. Â The best thing I've ever eaten: GOAT BELLY! Â Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside, and a heavenly bourbon butter sauce. Â Then, PIG FACE with a perfectly runny egg. Â For dessert, we had mushroom gelato, sounds weird, but it was so yummy.Also, the staff makes you feel very comfortable, and the decor is simplistically lovely. Â Unlike a few other high-end restaurants, I didn't feel like I didn't belong or that people were there to ""be seen."" Â Mazal Tov, Stephanie! Â I rooted for you all along in ""Top Chef!"""
"KenScale: 9.0/10Girl and the Goat, a New American restaurant by Stephanie Izard (winner of Top Chef season 4), is a remarkable dining destination in Chicago. Being from New York, I've been looking for a restaurant on my visit to Chicago that offers something I can't experience in New York, and the restaurant fits the bill perfectly. It demonstrates a lot of thoughtfulness behind blending seemingly incompatible ingredients into tasty dishes.The restaurant has menus divided into vegetable, fish, and meat sections, and also has a separate section for goats as well. Some standout dishes include: garlic potato wontons (with ramps, shiitake mushrooms and other vegetables), goat empanadas (goat meat was incredibly flavorful), and roasted cauliflower. Salmon was a bit salty, but the effect of adding strawberry into the dish mitigated that effect somewhat. For dessert, I had miso-butterscotch budino (with bacon toffee and glazed pineapple), which was the best dessert I had in Chicago.The restaurant has a pretty casual atmosphere, and the staffs, who are dressed in T-shirts with the restaurant's logos, were friendly and very helpful in choosing the right dishes. This is one of the hottest spots in Chicago, so getting a reservation will be quite a task. The restaurant does set aside tables on the lounge for walk-ins, and serves food at the bar as well, so if you can't secure a reservation, show up early and try your luck there. I came in for walk-in, and was very lucky to be seated at a tiny counter right in front of the kitchen."
"I understand the reason for the hype! Went last night for dinner (after making a reservation about 4 months ago) and had a blast! I was a little unsure when I saw ""Goat Face"" and ""Goat Belly"" on the menu, but figured it was a good time to expand my senses. Both were phenomenal! The cauliflower was also an excellent ""goatless"" addition. Â What really set the experience above most was the staff! They were all so so nice & fun to talk to. Just a very fun & enjoyable experience all around. Make a reservation now!!"
"Amazing dining experience. Excellent food, ambience, beautiful contemporary decor. Not pretentious whatsoever."
"This place was highly recommended by both my friends and family so my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out during our vacation in Chicago. This place definitely lived up to our expectations. The host was welcoming and we were seated right at our reservation time. Our server Gerson was very nice and open to the questions we had about the menu. He was also helpful in recommending what to order. My boyfriend and I enjoyed everything we ate (bread with apple cheese dipping sauce, oven roasted pig face, escargot ravioli, and pork shank). Our favorite overall was the oven roasted pig face so when you come here it is a definite must try!"
"Girl & the Goat literally blew my mind. Everything from the decor, to the service, to the drinks, to the food was phenomenal. The waitress recommended two plates per person but we opted for three each and I'm glad we did. The restaurant is tapas style so the plates come out as they're prepared, which was great because we were able to pace ourselves. I definitely suggest the following: Beets, Goat Cheese Dumplings, Goat Empanadas, THE HALIBUT, Grilled Octopus and last but not least their infamous Pig Face. The Halibut was my absolute favorite but everything was spectacular. As for dessert, we ordered a Peach Blueberry dish with GOAT CHEESE GELATO and were given (on the house) the Miso Butterscotch dish; both were ridiculously good. The drinks were also on point, especially the Never Ending Summer and Taglioni. Great experience and I can't wait to go back, but make sure to make reservations this spot is popular for a reason!"
"Went back again almost 2 years later and was able to order a few more courses since our crowd was larger.--Goat empanadas: YES, get these... Get 2 orders if you'd like because they are that good.--Peppers with miso: Surprisingly good. I love hot stuff and peppers but this is something I have never seen on a menu. Literally hot (but not too hot) whole peppers with stems covered in a little miso and light parmesan. We were scraping the bottom on our last bites.--Grilled octopus: I loved this dish but some counterparts thought that Rustic House had better. Delightfully lemony with some peanuts mixed in.--Escargot Ravioli: 5 raviolis, could have eaten more. These were darn good.Wine pours are small but whatever."
"Believe the hype. Â This is one of the rare places where literally everything is good. Â Choose dishes carefully, however, as two main dishes may be too much for two people if you also order bread and other appetizers. Â The goat ribs and pork shank are especially delicious, but honestly the Johnny Applecheese bread was the highlight along with the pan fried shishito peppers."
"For sure, one of my all-time favorite meals. We enjoyed a variety of small plates; each one thoughtfully prepared and delicious. The Girl and the Goat is definitely not a vegetarian oasis; however, there are several vegetarian options on each seasonal menu. While the meal was outstanding in its entirety, the Bittersweet Chocolate dessert stands out in my mind more so than the rest. So, yeah, bittersweet chocolate, toffee, shiitake-caramel gelato, and a shiitake gastrique. He frowned when I ordered it for us to share; however, his spoon returned to the plate repeatedly. Very energetic atmosphere (read: loud), Â her beer. The beer list is fab."
"Drinks: get the ""The Earhart."" Main ingredient: Yellow Chartreuse, an aromatic liquor aged with 130 herbs, plants, & flowers perfected by the French Carthusian monks in 1764. Also, the goat empanadas are divine."
"My friend was celebrating her birthday, and when she told me it was Girl & the Goat, I mentally twerked. Â I had tried on several occasions to get a reservation at this spot, but they were always booked. When we got there, a Regina Spektor song was playing. Â Now, you don't understand, but I feel like Regina and I are secret best friends and you never hear her in any establishment, so I felt like the planets were aligned and me and the restaurant were connected. Â We waited for about 15 minutes to be seated - no biggie. Â The place had this ambiance, similar to Hub 51. Â I wore my little black dress, only to see everyone dressed down, which made me like it even more. Â Franklins and flannels. Â We sat near the open-kitchen, which I enjoy, because I like to watch the chefs and I Â take tips in my mental notebook.I was a geek and asked if Stephanie was there, but sadly, my visions of stalking were shutdown. Â Our waiter was really cool and suggested that we all order 2 plates a peep (there were 11 of us), and that should be more than enough. Â I was feeling a bit selfish and snobbish, thinking, ""I don't want to share my Hamachi Crudo and Grilled Baby Octopus in exchange for Beet Salad and Calamari."" Â Unfortunately, I had to sacrifice my bitch feelings in the name of birthdays. Â The Beet Salad came around - pass. Â Then my Hamachi Crudo came out. Â It was delish but there were only 3 small pieces for about $15. Â I can't really expect more, but in my mind, I wanted to. Â I also tried the Grilled Calamari, Grillled Skirt Steak, the Braised Beef tongue, the Wood-Fired Walter's Chicken - Â all were less than amazing. Â I don't want to say it was mediocre, but they were all items, I wouldn't go back for. Â I assumed every thing that came out of this kitchen would be the second coming. I mean, the Wood-Grilled Broccoli was good, but then again, would you go somewhere just for broccoli?This girl said that the top recommended item was the Â Wood-Oven Roasted Pig Face. Â We were expecting something along the lines of the Texas Chainsaw Massacre, but it was your basic pic cheeks, topped with an egg. Â A little too gamey for me. Â The drink list was great, but I played it cool and stuck to Allaghash. Â Jay-Z and Stone Temple were Â playing, and we're talking Jay-Z - the college years. Â It was like my iPod was playing. Â We were there for about 3 hours, and it didn't feel that long. Â I'd consider going again, but maybe with a smaller group of people or date night."
"I recently dined at Girl and the Goat early on a Tuesday evening with two lady friends. Â They had originally made the reservations for two persons many weeks ago, but were able to add me as the third person to their party awhile back. Â Boy am I glad they did, as we all enjoyed an extensive and delicious 2+ hour dining experience. Â The interior is cozy, and the cutesy goat logo appears on the servers' shirts, menu cards, and paper napkin rings. Â We were able to get a table at a good location, so we were not crammed next to other diners. Â This is a small plates type of dining experience, and the personable servers were great in keeping new plates coming, maintaining filled water glasses, and giving us spot-on recommendations. Â  We ordered goat empanadas, pork shank (the largest portion of our selctions), beef short rib, a bowl of warm olives in assorted colors and sizes, chickpea fritters, and mushroom ragout. Â All ranged from good to excellent. Â There was an extensive list of goat items along with the famous crispy pig face, but we were very happy with our slightly mainstream selections. Â We also split two desserts, a sticky cake with blueberries, and a butterscotch budino. Â I also had a Ayinger Celebrator Doppelback, a tasty German beer that I have no idea if it went well with our selections, but it all worked well for me. Â The meal had a wide variety of flavors and textures, and overall it was just filling enough. Â Sure it's a bit of a splurge, but it was well worth it as a special occasion dining experience."
"This has to be my favorite restaurant in Chicago hands down. I have been going since they've opened and pretty much go at least once a month. I know, I'm so indulgent!I have pretty much enjoyed everything at this restaurant except for the goat belly, but I find that goat in general is too gamey for my taste. Everything else was delish though.Some of my faves: scallops, green beans, pork shank, chickpea fritters and pig's face! Great flavor, unique textures, fast and attentive service. Always a good experience!"
"A culinary delight. Absolutely amazing service, food is phenomenal the perfect of pushing your comfort zones and deliciousness! Menu is always changing, and prices are pretty reasonable for what you get! Highly recommend making reservations on advance, the wait is worth it!"
"I live in Saint Louis and come to Chicago often for both business and pleasure. Every time I've been in the Windy City for the last two years I have tried to get a reservation here at the Girl & the Goat. Each time I was meet with disappointment, as no tables were available. Â This visit I was determined to get my G&TG fix. I already had an early dinner at one of Chicago's chic new restaurants, but thought why not at least visit the Girl & the Goat for a cocktail. My hotel was only a mile from the restaurant, so I enjoyed a Â nice evening stroll. When I arrived, I shared my story with the host and said I just wanted to sit at the bar to experience Girl & the Goat.When I took my seat at the bar, I knew I was in trouble. The aroma of the food, the hustle and bustle of the servers going by with incredible looking plates was so tempting. How was I only going to have a cocktail? I glanced over the cocktail menu and being a fan of vodka I quickly ordered a ""4 in the same"". After my bartender presented me with my refreshing cocktail, he asked if I'd like to see a food menu. I responded, ""sure why not"". I figured it couldn't hurt, but boy I was wrong. Once I started reading, the more I wanted to eat dinner again. I knew I could not eat big, but now I really wanted to eat at least ""something"". Being a big fan of mussels, I thought that would be a safe and good way to go. They serve their steamed mussels with ""goat sausage croutons"", which are amazing. I loved the mussels, they were huge and the croutons had flavor beyond belief. I have never had goat before, and now I can not wait till my next time. The croutons and the mussels were a perfect tease until my next visit."
One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. They food is all wonderfully prepared and meant for sharing. Â Get the broccoli. It's like a campfire in your mouth. The smokey taste is fantastic.
"I came here with a friend who made reservations months in advance but his girlfriend had a work emergency and could not go... luckily I was invited. I must say this place is nice and fancy, and their food and service is pretty good, but I regret coming because the only way I would spend this amount of money is if I am on a date and trying to get lucky; also it did not help that it had a romantic setting and it was me and my buddy, although it was quite a funny dinner when the waiter asked us multiple questions as if we were a couple."
"I like this place, it really is a fine dining establishment, but don't come here if you are really hungry because they give you tiny portions.. Regardless the service is great, the food tastes amazing, and there is a reason it is hard to get a table reservation here. If you are coming here make sure it is a special occasion because it is fancy and the food is great, but you are definitely going to be dropping some cheddar."
"Two conclusions:1) Most dishes were tasty but because of the high fat content and extremely liberal use of salt.2) If you're dying to dine here, look for a last minute cancellation. Otherwise, it's not worth waiting hours for a table or dining during extreme off-peak hours (4:30pm or 10:30pm).The drinks were amiss; we sent two drinks back. I ordered from their wine menu. I'd avoid white wines or lighter reds here since the dishes are so heavy. We came with a group of 5 so we got to try a lot of things:BREAD: we ordered two types of bread. Yup, that's right, they charge $5 for a mini loaf. A bit ridiculous.BROCCOLI: a very tasty broccoli dish. Broccoli haters will actually love this because of the richness. Extremely flavorful but not too salty. It's topped with Rice Krispies. That type of thing is played out - putting pop culture foods on dishes. Anyways, still a very good dish. Â GOAT NECK: tasty but very, very salty. This is a very large dish; a good option to split with four or more.OCTOPUS: this was a hearty octopus dish, which was surprising since octopus is usually served in a lighter sauce. We liked the richness of it though it was too heavy by any means. PIG FACE: fatty and salty. It sounds more exotic than it looks or tastes. It just looked like pulled pieces of pork. Such a hipster dish. ""I tried pig face last night"". If you hear someone say that, you should correct them. It should be, ""I tried meat that was taken from parts of the face of the pig.""GOAT BELLY: the belly was delicious but I don't get the point of it being made with lobster and crab. The belly just overpowered the seafood.SCALLOPS: cooked beautifully but way too salty. PORK SHANK: delicious and recommended. While the shank - served in its entirety - seems like a cool, new concept, those of you who have traveled and dined in Central and Eastern Europe will have had something like this."
"As a native of Portland Oregon, living in the south suburbs has been a struggle in many ways. The main struggle being that my dinner options consist of Chili's and Outback Steakhouse rather than the locally owned and sourced style of restaurant that I'm used to. After a few months of dinner in the suburbs, my fiancÃ© and I decided we needed some new scenery, and after hearing so many rave reviews we made our reservation. Upon arrival we were quickly seated and given water. Our server was quick to take our drink order and make recommendations despite how busy she obviously was. The menu looked so good we ordered much more than we probably should have, but everything was so amazing that we managed to eat it all. The pig face, confit goat belly, and the hamachi were amazing. The quail was one of the absolute best things I've ever eaten and the miso butterscotch budino was easily the best dessert I've had in my entire life. We ended up ordering a cocktail each and splitting a bottle of wine from the impressive wine list. The Thai One On cocktail is a must have, but no matter what you order here whether it is food or drink you will not be disappointed. That is a guarantee."
"I would like to take the time to write a thorough review but just need to point out that in my three experiences here, ambiance is excellent but the actually although tasty is way too salty. No good for those who have diabetes or if you eat here frequently, don't be surprised if you do get it."
"Finally, we got a reservation at this hot place!!!8 of us were well prepared to enjoy Girl and the Goat. We ordered: 1 Â whole goat leg: Â  although it was a little bit expensive, the taste was good , the souce was good, the bread was good.2. pig face: Â never had that before, it was crispy and sauce was great. my husband was a big fan. 3. cauliflower: Â the best vegi Â I have had in the United States restaurant. no kidding. 4. green bean: Â sauce was fantastic.we also order wine according to the server's recommendation. Great choice. Atmosphere was great. and We could see the chef/sous chef preparing the food. Service was great. Â Patient explanation about the menu and warned us not to order too much stuff since we had a whole goat leg. highly recommended."
"Fan-flippin-tastic.Somehow my mom squeezed us in because of someone's last-minute cancellation. Â Super lucky. Â 3 of us shared a bunch of stuff. Â I really appreciated our waiter's insistence on not neglecting the vegetables. Â The broccoli was one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. Â The pig face was amazing as well.I also liked that the waiter was enthusiastic about the food, had great suggestions and was so chill that he really allowed us to enjoy our meal."
"No way another 5 star review for this place? You have to be kidding me. Everything is great. Service is great too. Â I'm pretty sure if you find anything 'wrong' with G&tG, you are a sub-human."
"My husband and I went to the Girl and the Goat after waiting a little over three months for our reservation - It was worth the wait. Â Wow! Â Our reservation was on a Monday night at 6:30 and you would have thought it was a Saturday night. Â The place was packed.We ordered diver scallops, crispy duck tongues, kalbi style beef ribs, wood oven roasted pig face, bread with pecan butter and apple butter, confit goat belly with lobster and crab and smoked goat rilette empanadas. Â My favorite was between the scallops and the goat empanadas. Â  My husband's favorite was the beef ribs. Â  Although they were my favorite dish of the night, they were the best ribs that I have ever had hands down. Â  The duck tongues were great. Â I loved the roasted pig face - so delicious!! Â The pecan butter and apple butter with bread was also delicious, almost like dessert. Â I also loved the goat belly with lobster and crab! Â  Â  We did not have actual dessert because we were happily full.The service here is excellent. Â  Our waitress was extremely attentive and offered good recommendations. Â  Stephanie Izard was there and it was cool to see her and get a picture with her as I am an avid Top Chef fan!I highly recommend this restaurant! Â  Plan ahead! Â You may have to wait several months :)"
"Now this is the type of restaurant I really like. Â The kind with sharing plates, so you get to try a bunch of dishes or just have a reason to pig out. Â I've been wanting to try G&G since the joint opened and glad I did. Â The food, the service, everything was great. Â It sucked that it took a 2 month reservation to get a table, but not a big deal. Â I also tried randomly going without a reservation on a weekend night and there was a 3 hour wait. Â Yup this place gets packed!Their menu is exciting, with a lot of interesting dishes to try. Â It was tough not ordering the entire menu, but we still ended up ordering a lot. Â Order a few large plates and a bunch of small plates.My favorites:- Old Fashioned Bread w/ bourbon butter & orange-thyme marmalade - freshly baked bread and tasty spread.- Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face- Sauteed Green Beans- Hiramasa Crudo w/ crisp pork belly- Fried Pemaquid Oysters w/ egg salad & capers- Escargot Ravioli- Â Confit Goat Belly w/ lobster n' crab & bourbon butterThe Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face was so damn delicious! Â The only downside is the dish only has a few bites. Â Next time I'll know to get a second serving. Â Can't wait to go back and see what's new!"
"All my wife and I can say is this place is fantastic. Drinks were excellent and some of the best we have ever had. Scallops were so tasty. Wife who is from Colombia (Empanda Capital of the World), loved the empanadas (and I). The pig face was the the best dish of the night. Â Staff was excellent and very courteous. Overall, we are extremely please with our time here. Â Recommend this place for those who love to try something unique."
"This place lives up to all the hype! Worth waiting for the reservation. There is a shared plate theme which is a lot of fun and each one delivers a special punch. A bit on the expensive side but completely manageable. Extensive drink menu with unique cocktails and a wide variety of beers and wine. Atmosphere is fun, not too noisy but definitely buzzing. Â The restaurant itself is beautiful."
"I'll get to the point: Â We ordered nine dishes to share. Â Most of them were just...okay. Â Not good, not horrible, just kind of missed the mark. Â Overpriced for what you get, and sorry but, boring dishes. Â Nothing spectacular. Â So many better restaurants in Chicago in that price range."
"This restaurant was very interested the the menu had items that I would have never seen in any other restaurant. The food was good, but lacked that extra ""BAM"" effect. I would reccomend the sagu. However, our server was not to friendly when she learned that none of the people in my party was going to be drinking. Otherwise, great place."
"Thankfully a friend scored last minute reservations on a recent business trip. (Note to self: always check Open Table at 4PM!)Hamachi Crudo: RefreshingPig face: TastyPork Shank: OutstandingShishito Peppers: AddictiveGrilled Baby Octopus: Something I could eat EVERY damn day.Went here with 4 friends and together we ordered about 16 plates --the waitress was also great about adding an extra piece or two where needed. I could be nitpicky (fried pickles were meh, and the lobster and crab overpowered the confit goat belly), but 5/5 definitely describes my overall experience: great cocktails, great beer, and excellent food.My favorite meal in Chicago to date."
"It was OK... I wasn't overly impressed. Â Everyone talked this place up that it was the best place in Chicago and you HAVE to go. Â I wouldn't agree. Â It was a nice atmosphere, great service, good food, but nothing out of this world."
"After a couple visits to Girl & the Goat and eating more than half of the dishes they offer (Shannon didn't wear her fat girl pants to the restaurant to have a light dinner) I figure I can offer up a brief opinion. Â Brief opinion = LOVE, LOVE, LOVE!!!!!For real though, I'm not going to go into huge detail because of all the other wonderful reviews but I do want to share a few of my favorite things.Veg:Roasted Cauliflower is the clear winner in this round. Â I've never pined after a vegetable dish as much as I do this one. Â I tried 3 of the others and this one was by far everyone's favorite.Fish:Hirimasa Crudo ... with pork belly?!?! Â Do you mean like bacon and sushi on the same plate!??! Â Win! Win! Win! Â Delicious.Meat:Pig Face, obviously. Â ----- Got this on both visitsPork Ribs were ridiculous. Â I grabbed the bone off the rib and a fork to take the meat off (so i could eat all pretty like, duh) and it literally fell off the bone. Â I was kind of shocked when after no effort I had a clean bone in my hand and a pile of the most tender meat EVER on my plate. -------- Also got this both timesEvery oyster and goat dish I tried was phenomenal. Â Actually, all of the food I tried was fun and delectable. Â The desserts were kind of crazy but still very good and every last bit was eaten. One of my favorite things about the restaurant is the atmosphere and the service. Â I think Girl & the Goat does everything right. Â I love that it can be one of the best restaurants in the city, one of the best meals I've had and still maintain a laid back and cool vibe. I came once in a dress and heels and another time in jeans and Converse and felt at home both times. I can't imagine anyone feeling intimidated or uncomfortable sitting and eating here because of how open the space and the people are.For me and everyone I dined with there wasn't one bad dish. I would gladly eat all of it again ... AND I WILL!!!!"
"Man oh man this place is good. It lives up to the hype, it really does. My boyfriend and I were lucky enough to snag a dinner resi on Monday March 2, and Leigh was our server. She is awesome, for starters. Super friendly and chill and cool. We followed her suggestions and got the pig face, surf n turf (goat belly and lobster), green beans, and cauliflower. My boyfriend just about went into conniptions he was so in love with the goat belly. He definitely got the vanilla sauce all up in his mustache :) I could not get enough of the green beans. Super bright with the fish sauce. And the dessert, oh god. I didn't think the meal could get better but Leigh explained the pudding-like dessert with cream and miso....it was one of the best desserts I've ever had. People, go here. Just so flipping fun and good. Thanks for taking care of us, Leigh. Service, food, ambiance, wine, everything was fantastic!!"
"I was recommended the Girl and the Goat months before coming on my trip to Chicago. Luckily I booked my reservation at that time, because I have heard it can be difficult to get reservations here. The place is a cozy, open spaced atmosphere with pleasant staff. You feel comfortable and not at all rushed when you are eating. The drinks are flavorful (and strong). Â  DInner is served tapas style, so it is good to go with a few people to explore more of the menu. Everything I tried below was delicious: chickpea frittersdiver scallops grilled baby octopus escargot ravioli wood oven roasted pig face oystersgoat empanadas I would definitely come back next time I visit Chicago. Just plan ahead with reservations (though I heard there is bar seating that does not require reservations)."
"The food was fantastic! We tried as many dishes as possible and they were all wonderful. I had the escargot ravioli and it might just be my favorite dish ever. We tried the tartare too which was excellent. We had an array of appetizers too that were also awesome. We couldn't get a reservation and there was a 2 hour wait so we staked out the bar and nabbed two seats after waiting for about 20 minutes. The bartenders were excellent!! The service was great and they were really cool people. Really made everyone there feel special even on a super busy night. The caramel/chocolate dessert was also amazing and we even got a complimentary dessert that was super yummy. Overall, great experience and I can't wait to go back."
"Girl and the Goat is all about a dining experience. From the expert way in which, the dishes are prepared to the sexy and swanky atmosphere down to the service, there's no mistaking that this place put a tremendous amount of thought into every aspect of the restaurant . Each plate was meant to be served alone without any other other competing dishes on the table so, that you can enjoy each creation in its' own fantastic and well executed way. The plates your dining on are changed after every new dish so, the complex flavors are never mixed. Girl and the Goat is truly edible art and we were certainly impressed.We ordered:Grilled Baby Octopus with guanciale, wax beans, romano beans, radish, and pistachio-lemon vinaigrette - I really enjoyed the ingredients used in this dish. Because the octopus and beans are generally more mellow in taste, they really can take on whatever flavor profile you want to add to it. However, the pistachio-lemon vinaigrette was just too overpowering making the entire dish too tart and salty.Braised Beef Tongue with masa, beef vinaigrette and salsa verde - I thought the chef had such a creative play on the traditional way beef tongue is prepared. Thin slices of the tongue with fried masa, this was like a deconstructed (and fancy) taco. The masa was a wonderful contrast to the strong flavors of the vinaigrette and really balanced out the whole dish. Diver scallops with bok choy and shitake mushrooms - My favorite plate and more mellow dish at Girl and the Goat. Don't underestimate it's subtle flavor though because these meaty and perfectly cooked scallops spoke for themselves. The delicious scallops were served on a bed of shitake mushrooms that were absolutely divine and a perfect complement. Grilled Pork Ribs Â with a tomatillo-mushroom slaw and grilled scallion vinaigrette - Â These pork ribs were fantastic. They were fall of the bone tender and had a sweet glaze that won us over. Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster and fennel - The goat belly was so smooth and velvety it practically melted in your mouth. The only downside of this dish is that we felt it was a bit unreasonably priced for what you were getting. If it's your first dining experience though, it's worth a try. The goat belly was excellently prepared.Hen of the Woods Mushroom Ragout with Sweet Potato Agnolotti, Shroom Creme Fraiche and Capers - Very similar flavor to the Grilled Baby Octopus..I really liked the Sweet Potato Agnolotti, it was so delicate and smooth, my goodness it was amazing. I would have enjoyed it alone without the tart and salty flavors of the ragout and capers. I thought the flavors of the dishes were incredibly complex and though some of the plates were a bit too overwhelming, I still have to give credit to how much work the chef put into creating such a multidimensional menu. Well done, Girl and the Goat."
"Our first time to Girl & the Goat for our 1st anniversary celebration, and we will definitely be back again soon with family and friends. What can I say that hasn't already been said, the service was top notch and the food was amazing. Loved the atmosphere and music. Definitely fulfilled and exceeded expectations on every level, something I certainly did not expect for all the hype that surrounds this Chicago gem. Compliments to Chef Stephanie & Crew!"
"I had dinner at Girl & the Goat during a trip to Chicago last week, and it easily stood out as my favorite restaurant on the entire trip, and I would say that it's stiff competition for any restaurant anywhere that I have visited in the last year. Everything we ordered was delicious, the service was great, and the interior design is incredibly chic. Highly recommended."
"There's enough reviews of this place that you can tell it's the real deal but I'll break down the dishes because that's always helpful. It reminds me a bit of Cochon in nola. Mushroom Butter Bread -Pretty amazing little loaf of this slightly mushroom flavored bread with a mushroom butter spread and Goat Belly Confit with bourbon butter, fennel, and crab and lobster - Ok, no joke but this tasted like vanilla cupcakes with some super rich goat mixed in. But in like a totally good way.Pig Face - Super famous and deservedly so. Super rich in the way that only a pigs face wrapped in on itself and roasted could be. They do a great job mixing in different textures and is amazingCauliflower with pickled veggies, pine nuts and mint - bright tasting and a nice change from the meaty meat meat meat.Pork Shank - but let's go back to the meaty meat meat meat. Roasted very well with some tasty burnt ends and caramelized connective tissue. The accompaniments are kind of random and unnecessary but work well enough nonetheless. I think if it came with some sort of limey bright sauce it might be better but this is nitpicking."
"I like the food, but I really hate the wait here. Probably explains why I postponed writing this review for about 3 years.Though the service is top notch and they make it really, really hard for you to hate them, I just can't say this restaurant is in my repertoire of ""go-tos"" in Chicago. The throngs of people clamoring at the door combined with the fact that I'm not sold on every menu item here make it absolutely impossible for me to 100% rave about Girl and the Goat. I'm sorry! I just can't do it.Once they called me on the day of a meal to cancel my reservation, but then offered us a redo any day/time of our choice. They then sent us 2 comped plates on the house, which was a wonderful way to try more of the menu than we would have liked. Plus, on our check, it said ""Friends of the Goat"" on our discount, which put smiles on all our faces. Things I remember from my first visit a few years ago include that pig face and fantastic squash ""rangoons"", as well as some great oysters. Admittedly, the desserts didn't blow me away. I came home with leftovers.I won't be so arrogant to think I might share something here that the past ~1800 reviews haven't. But in a nutshell: Wood burning = korean bbq. Don't wear anything here you don't want smelling like awesome smoke after. It's worth a trip to see what all the hype's about, but that's A trip - singular. My return trips are due to out of towners demanding we try it. Maybe this place will eventually be less popular and I'll be willing to brave the masses. Who am I kidding, I said that 2 years ago and it's still going strong...enjoy the wait, guys. This is one less Asian girl you have to fight for a table."
"Went here for my gfs birthday. Â We had about +12 girls and pretty much ordered everything on the menu here. Â What can I say - everything was GREAT!!! Â Service was nice and food came out fast. Â Plates are small so we ordered 2-3 plates of each. Â Not bad for the price, especially since we ordered a lot."
"Man (and woman - I'm an equal opportunity exclamationist)! This establishment came highly recommended, and the Yelp reviews were superb. Which made it all the worse when we came in, snagged a seat in the lounge, and were then treated to a subpar meal. Which is really too bad. The service was good, the ambiance (especially in the lounge) was welcoming but upscale and almost intimate. Oh, and make sure you don't take the recommendation of 2-3 dishes per person. That was way too much food, and we only ate about half of everything. Imagine if we'd liked it. Oh, the food. The broccoli-cheddar bread: chewy. Underbaked maybe? Goat and lobster dish: eh. Lobster wasn't cooked well, neither was goat. Escargot ravioli: couldn't finish it (and this was two hungry people). Shishito peppers: Kind of like mac n cheese topping on peppers, which could have been good, but was really just heavy and slimy. Mushroom ragout: also slimy and heavyChickpea fritters: mediocre at bestKohlrabi salad: probably the best thing we hadMostly, the food was heavy, bizarre in texture and overall disappointing. Admittedly, we are from California and perhaps have different taste-buds than Chicagoians? Regardless, I'd steer clear of this place. Unless you wanted to sit at the bar for a beer. Probably can't go wrong there."
"Not that this place needs another 5 star review, but I can't deprive myself of re-living a perfect evening celebrating my birthday with my family at Girl and the Goat! Our son lives in Chicago and insisted that this was THE place to celebrate when we came to town. He made a reservation 3 months in advance to be sure that we were taken care of for my birthday. A week before our reservation, we found out that my brother and his family were going to be in town and wanted to join us. Thanks so much to the G&G staff for accommodating this last minute request. Our party of 7 was seated at one of the few round tables in the dining room - perfect!I am 100% confident that anything you order will be fabulous, so I will just highlight a few of our favorites: goat neck (a huge portion), chick pea fritters, sautÃ©ed green beans, duck tongues, and wood oven roasted pig face; everything was ahhhmazing. And I would be remiss if I didn't include a huge shout out for the bread! The chicken little bread with chicken liver butter and carrot puree was beyond amazing; this chef thinks up things that make my taste buds sing. I would suggest dining with at least four people so you can have the opportunity to try a large variety of items from the menu. Our server was fabulous at suggesting how much to order. I love the way they serve the shared plates here; they stagger their delivery so you don't end up with 12 plates in the middle of the table! Another cool piece of the evening; they have you mark the menu with your selections and then let you take the menu home!I can't rave enough about the service...and the food...and the atmosphere!Atmosphere ""10""Service ""10""Menu selection ""10""Food quality ""10""Food presentation ""10""Food taste ""10""Evening at Girl and the Goat celebrating my 50th bday....priceless!THANK YOU!"
"Guys, the goat empanadas and the sticky date cake were both practically religious experiences. Trust your servers recommendations."
"I'm honestly quite torn between a 3-star and 4-star review.... some things were SO good that I can't imagine giving only a 3-star review, but some things were significantly underwhelming.The good:- Crispy pig face......... do not ask questions, just order this. OH MY GOD. It might be the most delicious pork dish I've ever eaten.- Miso hungry bread....... I know, I know. Some folks probably wouldn't even waste the space filling up on bread here. Trust me..... the Miso hungry bread is WORTH IT, and the table next to us equally raved about the Goat Bleu bread. Unless you are really carb averse (if so, I am sad for you).... bread = more worth it that you may think.- Steamed mussels..... good. Did not blow me away (for blown away, see pig face above), but a hearty portion size, and the garlic crunchies garnish seal the deal on this dish. Â - 4:15 to Georgia cocktail...... gin & citrus with a hint of peach...... down into my belly. Good thing it was a work night; b/c I could have swilled down about 8 of these.The mixed review:- Skirt steak: Was unfortunately served to us stone cold. Pretty surprised/disappointed by this. The server was apologetic and took it back right away. When a new dish was presented to us ~5 minutes later, the steak was sizzling hot and crazy delicious (I would order this again).... but the root vegetable hash with it was STILL ice cold. Very confusing. - Goat empanadas...... the filling was delicious, but the crust tasted like cheap vegetable oil..... the tatziki sauce served alongside the empanadas was phenomenal. Honestly the tatziki was probably the best part of this dish.The not-so-good:- Fried pickles........ soooooo greasy. I'm spoiled, my bff lives in North Carolina and I've had some bonkers good fried pickles down there. I will never order these again; they honestly just are not good. - Apple buckle...... I heard the desserts here were borderline better than the entrees.... seriously, the most ""meh"" apple crisp ever. It wasn't even warm. All in all, this place is good and I'm happy to have checked it out. However, I now really have nothing more than a big eye roll towards 2.5-month in advance reservations."
Fantastic. One of the best meals of my life. Get the broccoli!!
"How does this place almost have 2000 reviews? Â I'm blown away.I'll keep this quick.1. Getting a seat without reservationsHere's a secret. Forget reservations. If you have a small group, just show up at the bar area and you'll have a table ready in 20-30 minutes. There's a neat couch seating area by the bar and it's super cozy.2. DishesChickpea - order itGrilled Octopus - felt that they overcooked this, not that greatMushroom Rangoli - maybe Roasted Cauliflower - order itScallops - maybePig Face - order itTwo dishes per person is a good gauge."
"Great place serving (fairly) consistent good food. A little precious about taking reservations, but then it it's always packed - weekdays are no exception. Dropped by on a whim, on a Sunday, and still ended up at the bar, which wasn't too bad. Had the oysters and the soft shell crab, and was still hungry so I opted for the scallops, as it was one of the few main dishes that you could order a half-plate. It took forever, and while the forst two were excellent - this last one was a tad ""meh"" - the scallops seemed undercooked, and the sea urchin broth a bit overpowering... and that's something because I can eat sea urchin on toast any day.Loved the ambience Â and the vibe and definitely want to go back to try other dishes... if only I can get a table this time."
"it was pretty pricey, and i had noooo idea what i was eating half the time, but it was pretty good! the service was very, very fast when you were actually at your table. if you don't like close sitting, this place isn't for you :( but, the actual small plates were awesome and their dessert was lovely. i'd probably choose the little goat over this place, because i'm more into diner food versus small plates/sharing. however, the atmosphere is great and the service is quick.i suggest that if you have a reservation you don't get there too early! you're going to have to wait until the time of your actual reservation :)"
"Went here during our girls weekend, and loved every minute.We ordered 5 dishes and dessert. We couldn't decide on a few of the veggie dishes, so the waitress suggested getting Â half orders. We had the kohlrabi salad, which was possibly the best salad I've ever tasted. Next, the chickpea fritters. Don't skip these, they are incredible! Then broccoli and goat loin. Both were great and full of flavor. Although, our last dish, the pig face, was shut the front door good. I mean, common. Perfect amount of fat and meat. Don't skip this. To finish we had the boudini, which was very interesting. A great combo of sweet and salty. All in all, this place is worth the hype. Great atmosphere, excellent service, and some of the most interesting food I've ever had."
"I could go on and on, but suffice to say all the dishes we tried were excellent and the service was top notch. Get your reservations early!!!"
"Everything good you've heard about Girl and the Goat IS TRUE! It's casual and loud, but the service is good and you WILL appreciate the food, if you know how to appreciate good food.I would recommend making reservations at least 24 hours ahead of time. Two friends and I walked in at 6:30pm on a Thursday evening (today!) and were seated immediately (our time limit was 8:15pm - we were 'sneaked in' between reservations, we were told). We took about 15 minutes deciding what we would order; 5 to 6 dishes should be good, we thought, but ended up ordering the following 7 because everything sounded appealing!ham frites - the beer sauces that come with these deliciously crisp and thin frites are the highlight of the dish. The tomato based sauce was a favorite, we asked for more!diver scallops - not a standout dish, but well done and presented. The bok-choy complimented the well cooked scallops.sugo - pappardelle folded over tender pulled pork with hidden gooseberries that burst in your mouth with a sweet tanginess are a fantastic surprise against the meatiness of the pork and is just absolutely delectable! It set the mood and expectation for the rest of the meal.beef short rib - crispy fried rice neatly layer the top of three pieces of short ribs, with the heads of small mushrooms peeking through them. The beef, quite unexpectedly, melts in your mouth. Literally. I could feel the meat gently come apart, soft and perfect.mushroom ragout - small mushrooms blended with creme fraiche and capers adorn rectangular agnolotti that confine buttery mashed sweet potatoes waiting to burst in your mouth and send your taste buds into a frenzy. This was my favorite dish - I love mushrooms and ravioli and sweet potatoes. The sauce in this dish is a sort of gently sweet tomato creme concoction. It makes you almost want to cry.wood grilled broccoli - not my favorite, but then I've never liked broccoli, though I still managed to finish my serving of these smoked stalks over, what I'm guessing to be, whipped cream cheese with spices and garnished with little (pumpkin?) toasted seeds.crisp braised pork shank - a highlight that everyone must try. A shank of pork served with spicy kimchi sauce (which I only just tasted because I can't stand spicy food), kimchi, flat bread and yogurt mixed with cooling spices.The meat stays together as you cut and serve, but the moment your fork latches onto a piece and places it in your mouth is when the symphony begins. The meat is perfect. The skin crisp. It just soothes and hones your palette at the same time. Top it with a jot of the kimchi sauce for a glance of sweetness that gives way to a rolling wave of heat. Fantastic way to end the meal, I think.We were happy, full and completely awed by the food. As much as I would have loved to try the date cake, I could not have managed another bite so we concluded our journey of food ecstasy for the evening.I'd go back here just to try out the other dishes. Everything is presented well and is meant to be shared. I think it's great for groups of 2/3 - that way everyone gets a good portion of the a single plate and you get to sample many dishes."
"Fabulous restaurant. Â Great atmosphere and even better food. Â Definitely one of the best meals I have ever had. Â I came here recently to celebrate my boyfriend's first marathon. Â I had made reservations months ahead of time and was super excited about the meal. Â  Â My positive review is even more remarkable because I started the meal agitated being left to wait well past our reservation and then being initially sat at a counter basically in the kitchen when there were open tables the whole time. Â Some people may dig this, but we definitely wanted a standard dining reservation. Â I felt a little bit like they were trying to pull one over on us, but they were accommodating when we asked to be moved."
"Great food, definitely lived up to the hype Â (I recommend the scallops, green beans, goat empanadas, and beef short ribs) however keep in mind portions are small.. Great atmosphere too!"
"We had our department holiday party here and I can't begin to describe how much I was looking forward to it. From the moment we arrived the staff was wonderfully attentive, warm and welcoming. Chef Izard was on hand (not gonna lie, I am a huge Top Chef fan) and personally oversaw the food being prepared. From what I understand, there were some items we had that they were trying out for the first time. Every bite was perfectly seasoned, lots of bold flavors that blended so well, I was in heaven! Apps included crispy short rib bites, escargot ravioli, goat empanadas, Â mini pierogis, pork belly with blood orange, mini veggie spring rolls, bay scallops with mushrooms, clam on brioche (I think it was brioche?), a raw bar with two types of clams,muscles and grilled shrimp, fried oysters, I think there was more, but can't recall. Main course was kholrabi salad, sauteed green beans, roasted cauliflower, sauteed shrimp on a mustard seed vermacelli, roasted goat with crispy shallots and six sauce options and assorted breads with six spread options. They really pulled out all the stops and everyone agreed, even those folks who have been with the company 20+ years, it is far and away the best place we have ever gone for a holiday party. Chef Izard was kind enough to pose for pictures with those of us who requested them. The experience lived up to the expectation and exceeded it by leaps and bounds. I cannot recommend this place highly enough. It should be on everyone's bucket list."
"Had a great time here, nice ambience food and decor. Will recommend this place to friends"
"Fabulous experience! Â They gave my wife and I the two top overlooking the kitchen. Â The chefs working the line were friendly, engaging, and were genuinely interested in helping us with the menu. Â Service was excellent and the pace of courses was perfect. Â Food was outstanding! Â The crispy goat belly was unreal."
"Well finally a restaurant lives up to its hype! Â Fabulous. Â Love the decor, their logo, the pace of the meal. Â Only thing is -- they have crammed the tables way too close, it's almost like you're sitting on top of other folks. Â However, the food was definitely worth it -- we had broccoli (best I've had), scallops, pig face (yes, pig face). Â Everything had such a great flavor and unique spices. Â Unique mixtures of food. Â And not as expensive as I expected! Â Wonderful evening, and I look forward to returning."
Food is really good however on the greasy and salty side what definitely hit the spot :-) . Their deserts are awesome and basil and chocolate combination is just wonderful. Unfortunately Â our bartender didn't pay attention and swapped my credit card with another client what resulted with 250 dollar charge on my credit card. Although food is great staff needs to pay more attention to details and customer service.
"They have a really small waiting area for people who are waiting to be seated... That being said, the food was AMAZING!!! Everything is shared so my friend and I ordered a few things. We had the roasted cauliflower, grilled baby octopus, wood oven roasted pig, and the goat liver mousse. Every dish was super good! I have nothing bad to say. Each dish was made extremely well and the flavors melded together really well. The next time I go back to Chicago, I will definitely be coming back!"
"I've been waiting to write my review of Girl & the Goat because I felt that I needed a second experience. Â For a restaurant that has so much hype and yet also seems to have so much inconsistency, I felt it was only fair to base my review on multiple visits.My first visit was last year, probably about 8 months ago. Â We made a reservation in advance, salivated over the menu, hyped up the experience, looked forward to it all week, and were completely underwhelmed. Â The chickpea fritters were meh. Â The seafood dishes were just okay but nothing spectacular. Â The bread was downright hard, dense and disappointing. Â My fiance had just been a few months prior to that trip and said our visit was nothing like his first visit (which he describes as one of the best meals of his life). Â Everything was fine. Â The food was fine. Â The service was fine. Â The overall experience was fine. Â But it was nothing special and nothing that came close to qualifying the hype that surrounds this restaurant.This past Saturday, while on a walk around the west loop, my fiance and I hopped in right at 4:30 on a whim and managed to snag a table for an impromptu early dinner. Â It was like a completely different experience. Â G&G keeps a revolving menu of items, but they also change the way they create their permanent items. Â So the chickpea fritters that we ordered last year were nothing like the chickpea fritters they were serving this time. Â We ordered 5 items between the two of us, and could easily have stopped at 4 with very full bellies.Course 1: Chickpea fritters - absolutely amazing. Â A great mixture of okra and tomatoes with the chickpea and heavenly crispy blocks of goat cheese were on top. Â Absolutely delicious!Course 2: Grilled Baby Octopus - another delicious hit. Â The chefs at G&G have this amazing ability to push a taste to the limit. Â And the grilled baby octopus pushes the flavor of lemon all the way to the point of extreme, without going over the line to make it overpowering. Â The pistachios added a delicious crunch that went well with the charred flavor of the octopus. Â And the lemon tartness brought all the other flavors together and smoothed them out.Course 3: Driver Scallops - this may have been the only mediocre dish of the night, and by mediocre, I mean it was only very good instead of amazing. Â I've had perfect scallops in a variety of places, and these scallops were perfectly cooked but there was nothing special or unique about this dish. Â The kimchee and the rapini is a tasty accompaniment, but to be honest, I was tempted to leave the rest of the dish when the sepia came out and just focus on the new and shiny dish at the table.Course 4: Grilled Sepia - I had never had sepia prior to this visit and it has a very firm consistency similar to octopus but the taste of this dish was so different, we had no problem with ordering both. Â The tomato base of this dish was very tangy and tasty and again there was the presence of extreme lemon. Â It was tough to choose a favorite, but I think this might just be my favorite of the night.Course 5: Charred Pork Belly - This dish was just for my fiance, but I tried a bit of the flavor and it was excellent. Â A nice robust charred flavor that was not too hearty or overwhelming. Â He loved the dish. Â Pork belly by nature is extremely fatty so he left a good deal of the fat pieces left on the plate, but he certainly licked the rest of it clean.Service was wonderful. Â We were at a communal table 4 unrelated parties of 2 all seated together, but it still somehow felt intimate enough for just me and my fiance even though we were sitting next to each other. Â It was a friendly atmosphere and we enjoyed conversation between ourselves, as well as with the other patrons at the table. Â Our waitress was very helpful with advice and recommendations. Â The chefs sent out some complimentary fries with various dipping sauces for the table (to promote the social atmosphere) but the ladies in the corner seemed to think it was only for them and sequestered the plate between the two of them. Â Clearly, they weren't locals.5 courses and 2 drinks came out to under $100 for the two of us and we easily could have gone with one less item. Â I was so happy to finally experience the food that lived up to the hype at Girl and the Goat, but I have heard from many that they also have had the same inconsistent experiences. Â The only reason this isn't a 5 star for me, is because with the frequency with which G&G is constantly changing their variety, they seem to lose a little bit of credibility for always being consistent in their offerings. Â I'll happily come back in another 6-8 months and look forward to whatever batch of creations Stephanie Izard has come up with at that time, but I'm not sold yet on G&G being a dependable mind-blowing experience in every visit.."
"What can I say about G&tG that hasn't been said already like a BUNCH of times?long waits? yephard to get a rez? you beta bit crowded and loud? uh huh.BUT:not a thing on the menu disappoints? better believe itworth the wait? 1,000%excellent service? without questionupshot: This is one place where the cons are directly in result of the pros. Â It is crazy busy hard to get into and crowded because Ms. Stephanie Izard is one talented lady and her food is stupidly good. Â Seriously EVERYTHING. Â Even dessert. Â Take that Top Chef, Steph isn't afraid of dessert.Side-bar: I came here for NYE, and it couldn't have been a better evening (met Stephanie too). Â Although, i take that back, it would have been better if I had a multiple-stomach situation to accomodate the MOUNTAINS of food that never ended.If you're freaking out about the wait or the impossible to get reservations? Go early. Â You'll get in eventually."
Totally worth the wait. After having a 2 month advance reservation this place is exceptionally great. Being a vegetarian you do have good amount of options...a must try!!!
"I came here with high expectations. Â Who wouldn't?!? We booked 2 months out, and all people do is rave about it. Â The food was FIVE STARS!! I am a vegan and I loved every single thing I ate. Â The flavor depth was beyond explanation! Here is what I had: The tempura vegetables. Â The waitress said this was the only custom vegan thing on the menu (everything else was adaptations from the regular menu). Â The vegetables were perfectly fried and the almond butter they were in gave the perfect little zing! Â We also got the cilles relanos. Â SO GOOD! and the cauliflower, which was very good and flavorful, but I've had better cauliflower. Â I took two stars away each for a reason. Â First: it was SO LOUD in there!! We sat in a row of communal booths, and you would say well that is why, but I have been places like (slurping turtle) where is works and the crowd isn't so loud. Â Also the table next to us was appropriate for 2 people, but they put three people there, so there was very little buffer room between us and the next table. The second star I to away was not for the service, but for our server. Â She was very rude at times, and pretty sure she used the word tacky like 3 times when we asked about the corkage fee. Â I have read all these reviews from vegan bloggers that the serve staff was very accommodating to them, but I didn't feel that way at all. Â The way she spoke about the vegan menu and to my boyfriend as if I was ruining his experience. Â she was older that the rest of the wait staff so maybe she isn't as open minded. Â I would go again knowing the food was worth all the other unfortunate things about my first experience."
"FINALLY!!! I got to eat, try and taste this place.....allowing me to put this off my bucket list! hahaHad reservations at 8:45 on a Monday night (might I add it was pouring rain outside) and it was jammed packed inside!!!!Fortunately, we came early (8:00 ish) and as I checked in, the host stated he could seat us immediately! How can I say no to that?!?!Immediately seated, our server was Monika. Super friendly and welcomed us with a Â smile!Food:- ""PIG FACE"": HOLY SH%T THIS WAS SO DELICIOUS!!! A MUST HAVE!!!- Tempura loup de mer filet: I can't describe how delicious this was....its like a fancy fish n chips but tastier by 100 folds!- Kona kampachi crudo: The yellow tail fish deliciousness packed a lot of flavor with freshness.....so buttery!- Steamed west coast mussels: This was soooo good! Looked plain at first glance...but was buttery and garlic-y flavor!- Grilled Baby Octopus: Good, but wasnt wow to me...(Purple Pig's Octopus beats it out...sorry G&TG)- Kohlrabi salad: never had/tasted a salad with so much flavor! So gooood!!!There were some other plates and a dessert that had bacon crumbs...yes, bacon crumbs...that we ordered that was so heavenly! (sorry I can't remember)- Drinks: Best of Three (refreshing!), Before & After (nice citrius-y refreshing taste)Overall: great experience, glad I was able to eat, taste, sleep the experience! Definitely a must ""try at least once in your life"" restaurant!!!!"
Amazing food! Lucked out and was able to get an online reservation the night before...couldn't believe it! Had high expectations and was not disappointed in the least. Was only in Chicago for Â a couple of days and was so glad we were able to get in and I will definitely try to go back if I am ever back in Chicago. We ordered 6 different items and every one of them was outstanding! Service was great...you place your entire order at one time and the server just keeps it coming.
"All I can add to this place is that they deserve the 5 stars. The staff is so wonderful; and so I'd the food. I tell everyone visiting Chicago, that this has to be the must go place."
"This is absolutely one of the best dining experience I've had. Both the food and service were outstanding. Highly recommend the wood oven roasted pig face, the goat neck, and the confit goat belly. The other dishes, the goat liver pate, and crisp braised pork shank were also great, but clearly we ordered way too much food. I really can't say enough good things about this place. GO if you love great food."
I was in town last weekend. just 3 days. I read about this place and wanted to go but it was booked. My girl n I got there at 4:45 sat at an open bar (didn't last long). greeted by a very great bar tender. We had drinks and asked what we should eat. started with chic pea fritters (OMG) then sea bass (the most beautiful awesome dish ever) we then had the PIG FACE. it is the business it was incredible. we killed 5 glasses of wine each and had the most brilliant time.we then went dancing at Kingston Mines (recommended by bar tender)I LOVE CHICAGO NOWif you miss girl and the goat your killing yourself.Get there!!!!!!jeff
"We went early, before 5:00, and were able to get in write away. Â Nice mix of different things on the menu. Â I think it would even be better if they could add some lamb. Â The pan roasted Halibut, Pig Face, and Goat Neck are all must order items. Â Fun place to eat with a group."
"After hearing so much about the Girl & the Goat, I HAD to try this place out. The Girl did not disappoint; she lived up to the hype. My friend and I arrived on time for our 8:15pm reservation, but we were told that the restaurant was running a little late. We decided to get a drink at the bar. Whatever I had, I didn't like it though. We got seated at around 8:30pm, and we ordered the following:Corny goat bread-- Delicious goat cheese spread with corn relish. Worth the price? Maybe not, but it was a great starter.Wood fired wiley point oysters with horseradish, bacon, preserved lemon-- I like this too, but I also think that I could have done without.Goat carpaccio with tongue-olive vinaigrette and smoked roe-- This was one of my least favorite dishes. I got all excited because I thought it'd taste like a steak tartar, but it didn't really, and I just didn't really like it. Sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews-- Yum! Worth the price? Probably not. As someone who practically grew up on nuoc mam, I loved this dish. It was a bit salty though. The cashews were great with the green beans, and I suddenly felt the urge to add cashews to my regular cooking ingredients. Wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro and potato stix-- Possibly my least favorite item. I felt as though my fellow Yelpers steered me wrong on this one. It wasn't anything special, and it tasted like bacon and eggs to me... It might just be because I'm generally not a breakfast fan. Who knows. I didn't really like this dish.Confit goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster, crab, and fennel -- My absolute favorite dish. I think my friend would agree with me on this one, and I'm glad we ended our meal with this. It had the right amount of buttery and savory goodness. Just oh, so good! If I was rating just the food itself, I'd give the girl four stars, but the experience that night was just dream-like. We had an excellent server, and I loved our next table neighbors. I normally don't end up chatting with my dining neighbors at all, but there was a strange coincidence that night. My friend and I bumped into a lady that sat right next to us at The Purple Pig just a day earlier. Funny thing? Her name was Jennifer. I was never a Jennifer, but I usually love people with a similar name. Ha! Our neighbors on the other side of our table were fantastic to talk to too. I'd love to come here again one day."
very very loud!
"3.5 (rounded down cause I had such high expectations for this place!). Had Girl & the Goat on our list of must-dine places for our trip to Chicago and though not bad, it didn't quite live up to its hype.Upon arrival, we were told that there was a 2 hour wait and I couldn't help but laugh when the (very nice!) hostess offered to make us a reservation in May. We put our name on the wait list and returned to the hotel as the restaurant is located in a pretty desolate area. Our server, who had an awkward air about him, was okay and suggested several dishes to try. The dishes ordered:1. Bread w/ duck fat butter- nay.2. Pig face- yay.3. Grilled sepia- yay.4. Artic char- nay.5. Kholrabi salad- nay.6. Sauteed green beans- yay.7. Roasted cauliflower- nay.8. Short rib- yay.As expected in a Tapas restaurant, the dishes were small and with a table of four, essentially one bite a person. Some of the dishes were good (or halfway decent), others not so much but was it worth the $160 tab at the end? Absolutely not as many of the ""yay"" dishes were nothing to write home about. But hey, we get to say we tried it Â :)On a side note, get the Three Philosophers if you like dark beer."
"I have been trying to get into this restaurant for my last few visits to Chicago with no success...but this time was different! Â I was able to plan in advance and we hosted a baby shower for 8 people here tonight. Â Everything was perfect - great wine selection, amazing food, great atmosphere and feel to this place and excellent service!We tried too many things to list them all, but I highly recommend the goat empanadas, the cauliflower, chickpea fritters, the beet salad, the tempura loup de mer, the scallops, the beef short ribs, the chicken, all of the desserts and the berry meritage tea...ok, so everything is really good, seriously!Plan ahead and get a table...this place is worth it!"
"Having just returned from my second visit, it's astonishingly coincidental and dare I say...cute, that my greatest restaurant of all time (GOAT) is now decidedly Girl & The Goat.This time around, I had a more laid back experience dining at the corner of the bar. Â The Double Barrel and Double Standard have rotated out for a handful of newcomers including my To The Nines - an unexpectedly well-balanced concoction of Old Weller 107 Antique, amaro and sweet vermouth. Â Lo and behold, I had my mind blown when I learned that dishes could be had as half orders. Â Armed with such knowledge, I went to town and racked up a couple cruciferous veggies, some seafood and a hunk of goat.The lauded Roasted Cauliflower was enough to add another definition to the vegetable. Â Rarely do the ingredients in a dish complement each other so beautifully the way the vinegary tartness of the pickled peppers and sharp minty finish of the leaves did for the cauliflower. Â In a different savory realm, the Wood Fired Broccoli soaked up the flames to the point where I could quite literally taste the embers behind each floret. Â Combined with the smoky notes of the creamy bleu cheese underneath, the flavors made for the most deliciously complex iteration of this green yet.This theme of achieving deep complexity was evident in the Diver Scallop immersed in an amalgam of XO sauce, pork sausage and butternut squash amongst other contributors.Now the crowning jewel...an absolute BEAST of a rack of Goat Ribs. Â I must have had an episode of transient exophthalmos upon first sight of this mass representative of all that is good in the world. Â Sadly, I was only able to make my way through half of the behemoth...until I digested enough a couple hours later to kill the rest. Â The roasting job seemed to be impeccable as I found it very difficult to believe that the ribs of such a lean animal could have such fatty tenderness. Â In this regard, it was on par with braised pork belly plus a smattering of sinewy texture.And as the saying goes, there's somehow always room for dessert! Â Bittersweet chocolate and shiitake-caramel gelato drizzled with shiitake gastrique - Godliness reminiscent of the raw chocolate gelato at O Ya.Oh Girl & The Goat, how I love thee!"
"Pig face? Â Pig face!Yes, please, and I'll have mine with some favre beans and a nice Chianti. Â There were six of us (includes 8 and 11 yr olds) and every one of us was pleased. Â We gave ourselves over to our waitress and had her pick from soup-to-nuts. Â In all we had every part of the menu and would definitely go back.Well done!"
"Great food. Not mind blowing, but def 4 or 5 star Yelp worthy. If you rate less, that's madness, and you're probably a hater and a miserable person. Cool decor. Great service. The month long waitlist is kinda ridiculous, but definite bucket list for Chicago restaurants."
"If you are in Chicago you HAVE to eat here, you'd definitely be missing out if you skipped this one. I had reservations for dinner since it was a Friday night and pretty busy! We started at the bar with a cocktail while we waited for our table. The place was PACKED! My husband and I love to eat tapas-style, so this place was a hit! I can't remember everything we ordered but here are the dishes that i do remember:grilled baby octopusescargot ravioliwood oven roasted pig faceramp butter and toastgoat liver mousseI am usually not a fan of anything sheep/goat, not cheese, milk, and especially not meat...but of all the above items, my absolute favorite was the goat liver mousse. It didn't have that 'goat' flavor to me, but more of a rich umami flavor - almost like an aged Parmesan. I couldn't stop eating it! Second favorite, which I think is a seasonal item, was the ramp butter. Being from the Bay Area on the West Coast, we don't usually see ramps too often on menu's, so when I saw this I jumped at the chance to try it--and it did not disappoint!"
"I've tried to go here before I moved away from Chicago (sniffle sniffle). So I knew when I came back for a visit, I wanted had to use that opportunity. There were so many great things about this place, I don't know quite where to begin. The place is swanky with a capital S. Dark woods, dark atmosphere, and beautiful people. The service was spot on. The waitress was super friendly and no pretensions. She answered all my friend's requests regarding her allergies and even provided a menu with the ones that my friend could enjoy. Â You can tell when people are excited to work where they work.So being a table of four girls, we tried tons of dishes. I think that's the way to go but if you have only two, I suggest ordering 2-3 dishes so you can try a bunch of things. The dishes that stood out were the crispy pigface (salty, crispy, delicious!), the green beans, the mushroom (they were very savory and rich) and the pork shank that came with kimchi butternut. I cannot say it was kimchi, but it was the perfect accompaniment for the rich dense, savory pork shank with fresh crispy Indian bread-naan. Â Oh yeah, I also loved the goat confit. I know the girls were squeamish about trying goat but you cannot go to Girl & the Goat and not try a namesake protein. It was so good!The drinks were spot on too, they had a great selection of wines and cocktails. Being a glutton, I had one of both and tried the Goat red wine. What can I say...it had nice balance and freshness that helped the meal. Yes, it's loud. Yes, it's crowded. Just go there an experience for yourself. Â You will enjoy it if you give into the experience."
"February 14, 2014I usually try to do reviews chronologically, but I had just finished my OpenTable review and just lazily copy and paste most of it here! Â Hehe.I've always heard about this place and wanted to try it out. Â As a fellow culinary arts student and knowing future graduates of Le Cordon Bleu join the team regularly, I know I'll be much inspired by the delicacies here. Â None of these dishes had disappointed me and each dishes had their unique sense of style. Â The only similarity with all the dishes is how each dish intensely dances on your palate.Service is definitely a five star experience in a quick, relax, and enjoyable aura. Â The tapas style here certainly eliminates the high pressure of a standard meal course and timing procedures while provides each patron the flexibility to enjoy each dish as they quickly cruise onto the table.A successful business definitely cannot continue without an awesome team! Â Each staff members were extremely wonderful from the maÃ®treD to the auxiliary staff to the server to the kitchen even with the wonderful, knowledgeable, and almighty Antonio. Â Each service members also stand out individually, yet somehow discreetly blends into the background when the cuisines shine onto the table.I made this reservation on the opening day (November 14) and the hottest times (between 5:30 to 9) are gone since it's Valentine's Day. Â Regularly, it's at least month in advance. Â Check back regularly for openings since sometimes people cancel last minute and there is a first come first serve at the bar area.If you have a movie or a show to catch, you better forget about it since the experience here is definitely better! Â Still, you can make it to the show since each dish do dash out your way. Â If you have a dietary restriction, I think they can accommodate, but I know it's not the same kind of the dish anymore especially know how people like to epically and completely change the dish.Therefore, if you have a dietary restriction with I know for sure most of the time a prude, rude, and sound like you'll die attitude, I recommend you just learn to cook at home. Â No offense. Â By the way, a food preference is not an allergy!Pricing here is quite decently affordable and consistent throughout the year comparatively to other places on Valentine's Day where they will jack up the price.Most of all, I must thank the staff members for being so gracious and awesome! Â They definitely deserve a raise or an incentive!Lastly, since I do not have the time to individually go and trash all the 3 stars or below ratings due to my extremely busy work schedule while I took my precious time to read your childish and prudish reviews, you simply were not wholeheartedly ready. Â You were either supposedly wanted to go somewhere else and ended expecting the same experience here since you do not have the audacity of patience to wait 30 minutes for a burger, expect large portions even though staff members mention it was tapas style while perhaps you were busy on your phone or chatting away and assume large portions like Olive Garden, can't afford ti indulge since probably you just got out of college or is in graduate school and feel the need for the finer things in life though not classy enough to enjoy it because you feel entitle and somewhat cultured even though book smart cannot buy you class, or you're just a prude in general. Â Anyway, spread the love and not the hate.I usually defend most businesses unless they totally piss me off and I'm a usually pretty mellow, chill and relax guy. Â Just saying!"
"My dining partner and I had been looking forward to Girl & The Goat ever since we rooted for Stephanie during Top Chef Season 4, but the dishes we had were a mixed bag; while some were excellent, some were surprisingly unpleasant.We started off with their housemade lemonade and ""Happy Juice,"" a fruity ginger ale. Â The lemonade was very good, but the Happy Juice was just okay; the server described it as a strong ginger ale, but it was on the weaker end of ginger drinks I've had.These were the dishes we were able to try:Escargot ravioli (with bacon, tamarin-miso sauce) - A nicely balanced dish accompanied by crispy onions, which gave the dish a good textural balance. Â The sauce was rich but delicious. Â Braised beef tongue (with masa, beef vinaigrette, salsa verde) - The beef tongue was tender and paired with some pickled veggies which brought a bright acidity to the dish. Â The salsa verde was on the edge seasoning-wise.Wood oven roasted pig face (with sunny-side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix) - Our server helped us mix this dish throughly. Â The flavor combination was a delicious balance of sweet and savory. Â The pig face melted in your mouth.Diver scallops (with brown butter kimchee, hazelnut rapini, and avocado) - The kimchee was incredibly salty, but the scallops were nicely prepared and had a good sweetness. Â Roasted cauliflower (with pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint, and parmesan) - I thought this was a fine dish. Â The portion was very generous. Â The parmesan made the dish a bit salty.Wood fired walter's chicken (with asparagus, rhubarb, green goddess dressing) - The chicken had a bit of a generic barbecue taste but was tender. Â Some of the asparagus was deep fried; the other asparagus on the plate was quite bitter. Â The bread that accompanied the dish, which seemed like a sort of pita bread, was excellent. Â The rhubarb tasted fresh and tart.Sugo (with pappardelle, rosemary, and gooseberries) - I wish this dish had more pappardelle, which was tender and had a nice mouthfeel. Â The gooseberries were bright and flavorful. Â I found the sugo to be too salty; our server described it as a meat sauce, but I would say it was more meat than sauce. Â Config goat belly (with bourbon butter, lobster and crab, and fennel) - This was perhaps the most disappointing dish of the night. Â The goat belly was a bit on the dry side, and the seafood accompaniments were drenched in butter (to the point where you couldn't taste the seafood very well). Â We were given a sampling of their bavarois, which was a combination of a berry compote, sticky cake, and goat cheese. Â I personally dislike goat cheese, so I just sampled the bottom flavors, which I found to be on the sweet side (but the goat cheese might have balanced this out). Â If we were to come again (which is, I suppose, very unlikely since we're not local), I would have skipped the chicken, goat belly, and sugo for sure.We were extremely lucky to be seated right at the pass, which gave us an amazing view of the kitchen. Â The chefs we talked to were very friendly and helpful, giving us advice on where to eat in Chicago. Â Overall, some very good dishes, but many of the plates were over-seasoned, and the meal was not quite as special as I hoped it would be."
"Girl & the Goat is legit, even at 11pm. This was OMG DELICIOUS!my favs/must-try dishes:- Beet Salad-- so refreshing, so good! MUST GET!- Diver Scallops-- SO GOOD! love the kimchi/avocado addition. 2 large scallops, over a bed of spinach. Enough for everyone to try.- Steamed and fried Clams: Â Both steamed and fried in one dish. The aioli was a little more than I would prefer (maybe ask for light aioli), but this was still DELISH! - Wood oven roasted pig face: SO SO SOOOO good. mix it up with the fried egg and it is legit. - Sugo: this was a thick pasta dish with a meat sauce over it... this was surprisingly delicious!! Â Another must-get.- Crisp braised pork shank: meat SO good it slides off the bone. Comes with nan and sauces. good dishes:- charred pork belly: I've had a lot of pork bellies... this was good, but not a ""OMG must-try"".- roasted cauliflower: good veggie dish to compliment the entrees.- grilled baby octopus: I am very critical about my octopus... and I didn't love this dish. For my palate, this was a tad too salty. Coulda lived without it.5 stars in my book: great food, great wine, great decor. Â Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm coming back!"
"Came back for my girlfriend's birthday. Â We didn't have a reservation, but if you get there early enough you can get a seat at the bar or in the lounge. Â We had to wait maybe 20 minutes, but got a seat at the lounge, where we got to meet some nice Canadians in town visiting. Â The food was again delicious. Â I also got a Sidecar to drink, and they make a really great sidecar here. Â No major updates, still great service, great food and now I know I don't need a reservation 3 months in advance. Â Check it out for sure!"
Came in for a tuna sandwhich and got a delicious take on a classic sandwhich. An excellent gourmet experience for a reasonable price.
"Probably one of my top dining experiences ever. I love everything from the trendy, casual atmosphere to some of the most unique dishes I've ever HAD. I don't know how else to explain their dishes; it's like an explosion of unique flavors. Combinations of recipes that you'd never imagine being put together, but the results are magical. This restaurant is very difficult to get a reservation at and I can see why."
"GLUTEN FREE ALERT: Â There is a gluten free menu with lots of great options, so make sure to ask. Â They serve a gluten free bread that is...amazing. Great flavor, and the consistency is pretty close to the real deal.However, when the server (rudely) asks whether you ""just don't want to eat gluten,"" or if you'll ""have a reaction if you eat it"" - the goal behind the question stems from the oil in the fryer - which is not dedicated as gluten free, FYI. Â Right concept, wrong way to ask a guest about an allergy!!! Â Someone should coach waitstaff at this restaurant to ask guests whether gluten free is an ALLERGY or a PREFERENCE so they don't feel obligated to disclose how severe a reaction is. Also - see if you can get a seat in front of the cook line. Â It's like sitting in on a live Food Network show!"
"The food was excellent. Â We managed to get a reservation on fairly short notice for a Thursday night (wanted to do Christkindlmarket, but it was too cold) so we ventured over to G&TG and was not disappointed.Food: The Chickpea fritters were unreal. Â Extremely flavorful and melted in your mouth. Â The Porkface was definitley something to write home about. Â Even my reluctant companion tried it and agreed it was excellent. Â For dessert, she ordered the Apple Buckle and despite having split 5 dishes, we still managed to finish it. Â All in all, go there, leave happy."
"My boyfriend & I came here for dinner our first night on vacation in Chicago and it really set the bar high for anywhere else that we planned to eat. Â We got to sit at the cook's counter and if you have the option to do this, I highly recommend it. Â Hadley, a sous chef, was incredibly friendly and helped us all night with recommendations on what to eat. Â She was spot on! Â There was also another sous chef, that I think did most of the desserts who was also very friendly.Our waiter, Gary, was incredible. Â He was very attentive and also gave solid food recommendations.While here, we had the following dishes:Green Beans (sounds simple and boring and we were totally against getting them, but you MUST try them. Â absolutely amazing)Pig FaceOystersKohirabi SaladOne of the goat flatbreadssquash blossom rangoonsome type of fritter that was a special"
"We definitely enjoyed our time at Girl & The Goat after months of waiting for our reservation date (though we don't live in the city so wanted to go on a weekend- definitely busier). The atmosphere of the restaurant is great. It is bustling and has great music and energy- but it is definitely loud. If you are looking to have a group conversation, this is not the place. The service was great- we were offered drinks almost immediately, never had to ask for refills, and had anything we needed explained on the menu explained.The food was delicious, though we did not like everything we ordered. Our favorites were the duck tongues, pig face, and strawberry parfait. We personally weren't crazy about the fried pickles, though they were far from bad.I'm not sure we'll get back soon, only because there are so many restaurants in the city to try- but we really enjoyed our special evening and all of the fun new foods we tried. If you are looking for a unique experience, give Girl & The Goat a try!"
"They do small plates (tapas style) with vegan (v), fish (f), and meat (m). I am telling you this because I made a fool out of myself when I saw the 'v, f, m', and I couldn't figure out the 'f' for a little bit...Good idea to start off with 2 plates per person and of course you should share. We had 6 plates: goat belly, goat liver mousse, diver scallops, escargot ravioli, ham frites, grilled ahi tuna. I didn't really like the escargot ravioli. Escargot usually has a strong taste to it but I barely tasted in the ravioli. The ham frites were too salty but texture was good. The rest were amazing. The ahi tuna was grilled on the side and slightly raw in the middle and it is so tender when you bite into it. The goat liver mousse was so good, I scraped every last bit of it out of the little jar even when I had no bread left for it. Can't waste good food, right? The goat belly dish was my absolute favorite. It had a nice sauce and flavor was just delicious. I can't even describe it anymore, just make a reservation and try it. Since we have two stomachs, we had desserts even after being super full from our dinner. We had the bittersweet chocolate cake and apple crumble. Way too much food..Note to self and people who are reading this: Don't force yourself to eat so much. You can always come back."
"I have been to girl and the goat over a handful of times in the past and have enjoyed it enough to go back whenever I have the chance. But after last night's experience,I'm done with this place. We had reservations at 8pm for 4 people. We all arrived exactly on time and seated right away at a nice table, but from the moment we sat down we felt like they were eager to just get us out as soon as possible. We all wanted cocktails to start and our server interrupted us numerous times while we were chatting and drinking the cocktails to get us to order. Normally they pace the dinner so that only one or two dishes come out at a time but last night the dishes came out sometime 3 at a time and were nonstop. We were all still eating our pork shank when the server said she knew we were still eating but wanted to give us the dessert menu! She brought the bill out while we were finishing our dessert and constantly came back to see if we put our card out. In the end we paid almost $400 for a dinner where we didn't feel like we could relax and enjoy ourselves."
"I loved every minute of eating here. The rustic, homey ambiance was supplemented by lightning quick service. We got all our food within minutes of ordering. Among the every popular pig face dish with notes of syrupy sweetness and umami, we also had the goat empanadas, sour dough bread with ramp and garlic as well as two types of oysters. Amazing food with great attention to herbs and sauces.Note: we were seated in minutes without reservations! The trick is to get there right when they open at 4:30pm."
"My review means absolutely nothing in terms of anything I can add to Girl & The Goat's already stellar reputation. The food was amazing; the decor, exactly my style (relaxed, rustic, monochromatic); and the drinks were on point. The service was also worth noting as it was a refreshing break from the normal pretentiousness that comes with dining at one of the city's more popular restos. They were nothing short of attentive, knowledgeable, and pleasant.I usually find that hype in Chicago doesn't stack up to the actual end product, but I'm happy to say that it stacks up here. They really do take pride in the work the do; there's a level of enthusiasm here that comes with being proud of what you're doing, and I can tell you from my experience that that pride has a lot to do with the esteem with which G&TG is held, but it probably has more to do with the high level integrity and exceptional service provided every time a plate leaves the kitchen."
"We made our reservation one month ago and were so excited the day finally came. We had dinner there last Tuesday and the flavor of all the small plates we ordered did not disappoint. Our server was super nice and gladly explained the menu to us.Flavor-wise, the food was excellent. However,(1) the grilled shrimp was a tad over-cooked. The shrimps were somewhat rubbery.(2) most of the other small plates that we ordered (pan roasted halibut, sugo, spring onion potsticker, goat empanadas) arrived somewhat cold. We were expecting the food to arrive warm. It seems as though the food spent some time waiting on the counter for a while. Since our table was so small, it could only accommodate 2 plates at a time. It made sense that some of our plates waited on the counter for some time.(3) the roasted cauliflower was a big winner! It was delicious and actually arrived at the right temp. The budino for dessert was to die for. Not exceedingly sweet but sweet enough. A fitting finish to a delicious dinner.Overall, great food! We are definitely going back there. Will try to get a bigger table next time, if we can."
Wonderful dining experience. Â Warm and friendly staff. Â Group favorites were the pig face and the duck tongues. Â Yum!
"Having booked reservations three months in advance, expectations were high for Top Chef Stephanie Izard's debut restaurant. Â The menu consists of an assortment of small plates broken down into primary categories of V(vegetables), F(Fish/seafood), M(Meat). Â Secondary sets include bread, cheese, oysters, and dessert. Â Finally, due to the restaurant's namesake, there is also an entire list of dishes devoted to goat (incidentally Izard is a breed of goat found in the Pyrenees). Â  Our group of 4 split a wide array of dishes to sample the gamut of the offerings which vary on any given week. Â The order of the meal was as follows: Duck Duck Bread (duck-fat bread served with smoked duck-fat butter). Â Hard to pass up on the name and its potential for being amazing, but sadly it scored a (duck duck) goose egg for flavor. Not a good sign when a member of your group asks the server when the duck duck bread is coming out after mistakenly eating it thinking it was complimentary house bread and butter to start off our meal (cue in Debbie Downer music....wah waaaaah). Â Grilled Baby Octopus- Â The interplay of the smokiness of the octopus and the unsmoked Italian bacon (guanciale) are nicely balanced by the hint of acid from the lemon vinaigrette and I thought it was a clever touch slicing the celery root and red bliss potato into similar size squares to create the visual illusion of two ingredients appearing as one and being pleasantly surprised by contrasting textures on the palate. Â The additional nuttiness and aromatic crunch from the braised pistachios completed the brilliant combination. Â  Scallops- I rarely order scallops as a main entry since I liken their ceiling in quality much like Norm MacDonald describes the two categories of cliffdivers: grand champion and stuff on a rock. Â In this case the scallops were cooked to perfection although the alternative would have been gummy stuff on a plate. Â What makes this dish stand out are the accompanying players of pumpkin brandade, pecans, fried brussel sprouts, tarragon, and fresh pomegranate seeds. Â Creative chaos at its best. Â  Sugo- Â this was one of those dishes you just knew had to be good based on its description: Â a meat sauce of goat, pork, and veal atop fresh made pappardelle with cape gooseberries and drizzle of bechamel. Â Unlike a traditional meat sauce, sugo is pretty much meat gently binded by a light amount of tomato sauce allowing Â each separate meat to stand out rather than blend together like a traditional ragu. Â  I've had several variations of pappardelle with meat sauce in my dining adventures and this one will be my new gold standard.Cauliflower- roasted and then dressed with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. A nice break from the onslaught of meat courses which elevates a relatively bland veggie to rockstar status. Â Can't wait to make this at home.Pork Shank- crispy braised flintstone style hunk of meat accompanied by butternut squash/shitake kimchee, buttermilk dressing, and naan bread. Â I liken this to Seinfeld's black/white cookie, rather than racial harmony, the components borrowing elements from Southern, Korean, and Indian cuisine appear to be all clashing on the plate (although thankfully not in the belly). Â My least favorite dish of the evening, Â All three components were underseasoned, and combining the elements together doesn't really create the United Nations gyro that was intended.Goat belly confit- accompanied with lobster/crab, fennel, and brown butter, the goat was unmemorable and being a relatively lean animal, not sure if this cut bears any resemblance to pork belly. Â A mediocre iron chef dish that I do not plan to revisit.Wood-oven roasted pig face- probably unfair to evaluate this dish since it was at the conclusion of our meal where we were verging on meat sweats, this is a very rich dish with crispy meat topped with sunny side up egg, and deep fried shoestring potato sticks. Â Tasty to be sure, but not necessarily in a sophisticated way. Â More of a corned beef hash kinda tasty where you know it's a massive calorie bomb, but not quite sure if it will be worth the extra gym sessions to work it off.Definitely a worthy dining destination whether you're a local or tourist in Chicago (the Purple Pig is like a poor man's Girl and the Goat if you can't secure reservations) and there were definitely some hits and misses to Chef Izard's whimsical menu, but I appreciate her fearlessness in taking chances since more often than not, she gets it right."
"I've been trying to get into this restaurant for 2yrs. From NYC and travel often for work in Chicago. It was so worth the wait! By far one of the best meals I have ever had on Chicago. Service, food, was perfect. Started with goat empanadas suggested by our waiter, Trevor. Awesome. Moved onto one of the fish dishes, than the pirogies, than cauliflower and pork shank. Every dish has many levels of flavor that it's honestly hard to describe. We found ourselves looking at other tables to see what they ordered because it all looked amazing. I highly recommend it if you are an adventurous eater, even if you aren't you are sure to find something delicious. I can't wait to go back."
"Meh.For some reason, we were not that crazy about the food here.Every single dish had a smoky taste....even the bread and the salad.Our server was extremely accommodating of my food allergies and even provided a marked up menu showing me what dishes were safe for me to order."
"This is a fun place, lots of unusual (not ""unique"") dishes, but way too pricey."
"I've been to G&G twice in the last two months and am working my way through this menu. Â The best recommendation I can give you is to go with a big group. Â There is too much deliciousness that you do not want to miss. Â (1) RESERVATIONS - While you can walk in early and sit in the bar area, if you want the full experience, make reservations (even if you have to wait a few months to get in).(2) THE GOAT LEG - Ordering the goat leg is something you should add to your ""to do"" list. Â While the menu says you can ask your server if one is available on the day of, your best option is to order it ahead of time when you make your reservations as there are only 2-3 available each night (yes, I realize goats have 4 legs). Â This is something that must be eaten in a group (6-8). Â I went with a group of 6 and we got through a 5.5 lb goat leg. Â This is by far one of the best things I've ordered in Chicago. Â The goat fell apart and was braised to perfection. Â It came with sides of onion strings, warm fresh naan, hard boiled eggs, and five sauces (harissa, tzatziki, garlic/shallot, horseradish cream, and salsa verde).(3) THE PIG FACE - This is one of the best things on the menu. Â They wood-fire parts of the pigs face (I think the cheek), which comes with crispy potato sticks, an oozing sunnyside-up egg, and hints of maple and tamarind. Â Just cut it up, mix it all up and you will have the perfect bite.(4) VEGGIES - Being primarily a carnivore, I was initially disappointed when my table decided to order so many veggies/salads, however, I will never complain again. Â G&G does veggies right. Â Some of my favorites: Â green beans, kohlrabi salad, beets, and the squash blossom rangoon.(5) OTHER RECS - goat cheek, escargot ravioli, beef ribs, goat empanadas and anything on the the ""specials"" menu. Â For dessert, you cannot go wrong with the bacon/toffee budino."
Wow! This was some of the best food (and service) I've had in my life. We came here for a friend's birthday and were definitely not disappointed. I love the pork! And their cocktails were delicious.
"Absolute incredible! Best meal/dinning experience I have ever had! The pigs face is absolutely incredible and a must have! Great relaxed, comfortable, and casual environment. Absolutely plan on returning again sometime!"
"Perfect in every way. Impossible to get a reservation, but worth the wait. Â Order the pig face, you will not be disappointed."
Loved almost everything. Â The goat face with egg was the one dish we didn't thoroughly enjoy. The goat empanadas were my favorite. Little goat and girl and the goat are welcomed editions to randolph street!
"While visiting Chicago, we stumbled upon The Girl and the Goat as one of the newest and trendiest places to eat. You can make reservations but I didn't know what day I would be dining there with friends. When we walked in, the place was packed...I mean you would think they're serving free foie gras or wagyu beef steak, however it's just because the food was that good. We came on a weekday and the wait was 1 - 2 hours....oh my. We decided to try it the day after and went to another nearby spot. I like the decor inside....bar to the left, open kitchen in the back, wood, brick and concrete build, plenty of seating....but really loud so it's not great for intimate setting.The next day we only waited about 30 min before being seated and at a walk-in reservation. It was still packed but we were really interested in trying the food...especially being a top chef winner. We had the following:roasted cauliflower pickled peppers . pine nuts . mintpan fried shishito peppers parmesan . sesame . misosauteed green beans fish sauce vinaigrette . cashewswood oven roasted pig face sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stixconfit goat belly bourbon butter . lobster n' crab . fennelThe waitress was nice enough to bring us the pan fried shishito peppers for free because the food was taking so long without us even having to ask. The waitress and staff was very attentive. Onto the food....it was really great. Our favorite dishes were the wood over roasted pig face....definitely don't get to eat that on a daily basis, and the confit goat belly...sure why not...we're at a place called the Girl and the Goat...Probably the least favorite dish was the sauteed green beans because the fish sauce was just too overpowering. I would definitely come back to try this restaurant again if I were visiting Chicago so it comes highly recommended. I just hope you can wait 45 min to 2 hours which seems to be the normal average wait time depending on your party size."
I had a private event on the Rooftop of Little Goat... AND a cute holiday dinner at Girl and the Goat. Â These chefs are flipping genius-tastic. I love everything they make. I love their staff. I love their spaces. I love their bakery.LG and G&Goat are two of my favorite spots in Chicago thus far. Well done.
"Pig face was delicious, as well as the escargot ravioli. Â Service was impeccable if not best I've had!"
"You know how good the food is when you walk in the door and take one whiff. Â Great setting, great energy. Â Menu is all around superb. Â Tried rare bourbons at the bar and the wine selection is perfectly paired. Â Tried the chickpea fritters, pork belly, goat belly, oysters, goat empanadas, the pig face (*) and the diver scallops (amazing)..finished us off with the apple buckle. Â Just an all around fantastic restaurant. Â Bravo."
"Of course I had heard of Girl & The Goat before, but for some reason it was never on my list of ""places I NEED to go"". Â So yesterday, after being turned down at one restaurant, our next pick turned out to be closed, and a variety of other depressing mishaps, my husband suggested coming here. Â We called ahead and the wait was about an hour so we figured we might as well just bite the bullet and do it.Once we got to the restaurant to put our name in, they said they would find us at the bar, so we went and awkwardly stood behind all the taken bar seats. Â About two minutes in, I was thinking to myself ""why did we agree to stand here for an hour?!"" when one of the hostesses approached us and said they had a table open but they needed it back by 8 for a reservation (it was 6:30!) Â SCORE for only having two people!When we were given the menus I honestly had to look up pictures online of what everything was. Â I'm not enough of a foodie to Â know what things like ""kona kampachi crudo"" or ""yuzu harissa"" mean, and I had no idea it was a small plates concept. Â Our waitress helped out though, and approved our initial choices as well as suggesting the roasted cauliflower, which was absolutely delicious. Â My only gripe is that there were some long periods of time where we didn't see our server, which made me a little sad since I wanted the chance to order dessert before our time cutoff. Â She did say we had time, but by then I was too nervous to risk it and nothing looked tempting enough anyway. (cue Sprinkles ATM)I'm not sure exactly how their reservation policy works, but we will definitely make one when we come back (which is guaranteed).P.S. Â The bathrooms, although being downstairs, are private and clean."
"We waited a long time for a table on a Saturday evening but it was worth it. While waiting for our table, we were able to sit by the bar and order a bottle of wine. When we were finally seated, we realized we had the best seats in the house - we were right by the chefs who didn't fail to entertain!The big hits of the evening:1) sauteed green beans (fish sauce vinaigrette . cashews) - normally, we aren't fans of green beans but we could come back just for this dish. on its own. over and over.2) wood oven roasted pig face (sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . red wine-maple . potato stix) - we ate this just because of its name. it turned out to be amazing. it is a signature dish of the restaurant and definitely lived up to its reputation."
"I went with a friend on a Sunday at about 5pm and there was an one hour wait for a seat but luckily, I found two seats at the bar area. The service was great and the food was AMAZING! We started off with a little loaf of bread with mushroom butter (never had mushroom butter but it's my new fav) and the fried pickles with some kind of aioli (don't remember), I had the crispy pork shank accompanied with a kimchi salad (the moment I put my fork in the pork shank, I knew I had something devine) and she had the scallops which was also very good! We finished the meal off with the miso-butterscotch budino with bacon toffee, glazed pineapple and candied cashews which was to died for! I will be coming back for my immortal beloved, the crispy pork shank!!!"
"Came back to Girl and the Goat for a friend out of town. Instead of making a 3-month reservation, we instead called ahead and arrived early (~5pm) to see if there was a table. Since it was a weekday, they let our party of 3 ""borrow"" a later reservation as long as we were done in 1.5hrs. [As we found out, 1.5hrs is actually perfect; the food came out faster than normal but we appreciated the faster pace].Order time! - the happy juice (a blend of their fresh juices) wasn't as good as last time because it seemed watery and also lacked its usual visual pizzazz- their a-MAIZ-ing bread was alright. Their bread/butter selections change frequently, so we were sad that we couldn't get our past favorites. - the chickpea fritters were awesome! it had a creamy, soft texture surrounded by a delightful crisp. recommended!- the goat empanadas were pretty good. nicely cooked, tender goat meat inside a flour shell. was nice to try.- the roasted beet salad was slightly salty, but I enjoyed the refreshing greens and the sweet beets. I would get this over the very salty green beans unless you're really craving fish sauce.- the roasted cauliflower was a well-cooked dish. Nothing wrong with it, more of a normal dishbut,- the pork shank was utterly amazing. best dish I've had at G&G, best pork I've had pretty much ever. combined with naan, butternut squash kimchi, buffalo and buttermilk sauce - it had a perfect shell of crispy in a mouthwatering tender melts-in-your-mouth goodness inside. simply delicious, a must-try!We really enjoyed our repeat visit to Girl and the Goat. The pork shank really impressed me, and I'm definitely looking forward to getting it again. Until next time!"
"Spur of the moment reservation was totally worth it. I have been hearing nothing but amazing things about girl & the goat and finally had an opportunity to eat here.Atmosphere is warm, noise level is loud but appropriate. Staff are extremely nice and knowledgable about the menu.Ordered the goat belly special which was exceptionally good. Guest ordered the lamb ribs which we're fall off the bone amazing.Will definitely be coming again."
"Again - the hype. Â I just don't get it. Â What tha??? Â Really??Let's put it this way - I just expected a HELLUVA lot more than what got delivered based on reviews and people's insanity to get a table. Â We got there at 4:30 and sat at the chef's table with 4 other couples we didn't know. Â Whatever...it would have been nicer if they were more talkative but oh well.The drinks are fantabulous. And our waiter was so nice and just as cute as could be.But the food was eh. Â Eh. Â It wasn't bad. Â But it wasn't like, OH MY GOD!!! THIS FOOD IS THE BOMB!!!I don't know if people just overlook the ""Eh.ness"" of the food because of the reputation or if I'm really just a food snob and require excellence for my taste buds.Whatever the reason, I won't be back."
"This place is awesome!!!! We were here for dinner and tried lots of different appetizers and other dishes on the menu. The pig face was amazing!!!I would definitely go again and also recommend to friends. It has a great atmosphere, music is not too loud."
"It's all been said before.I went with a group of about 10 people. We didn't know the best way to order, so the waiter said they'd tell the chef how many people we had and they're just bring out a sampling of things that would be enough for everyone. So good. We also ordered a goat leg. It was a ton of food and all of it delicious. We left holding our bellies and promising we'd never eat again (in a good way). I'd choose to go here over any stuffy River North place any day."
"THE BEST RESTAURANT IN CHICAGO!The pork shank with the naan is soooo good.Get the halibut with the blueberries if it's still on the menu. The sauce is amazing. The green beans are the best vegetable you'll ever eat.And finally, get two orders of the goat empanadas b/c they are that good. I promise."
"I went here a few days ago with two girlfriends and overall we had a fun time. The restaurant is beautiful, the service was fine and the food was overall unique. But I am kind of surprised by the overwhelmingly high ratings for here. It just didn't blow me away. And one of my biggest issues was prices compared to plate sizes. I know, I know, this place it pricey. I knew that going in, an yet, and yet! I was still a bit ... irked with the G&G. Perhaps I'm not wealthy enough, or enough of a ""foodie"" to truly appreciate this place, but take the pork belly dish for example. It comes out and it just looks like almost nothing. It had three measly pieces of pork belly (yummy, but 65% fat) and then some sort of raw fish underneath and a few whisps of bread. And all I could think of was: This costs $20? I'm not ""cheap"" or anything. My BF and I go out quite a bit, but at the end of the day, I just felt a bit ripped off for what we got. And to be blunt, I only actually liked half of what we got: The bleu cheese broccoli was to die for. Best dish of the night by far. I know, broccoli! The apple jack bread was delicious, but again, it was so tiny! This little baked ball of bread was no bigger than a grapefruit. And the ham frites were yummy, but how can you screw up French fries with meat sprinkles on top? We got the lobster dish with some sort of meat. Don't remember. It would have been good but it had ""vanilla bourbon butter"" on it and we all agreed the vanilla gave the dish the weirdest sweet taste that seemed inappropriate for the dish. Again, service was good, but I felt at the end that she was a bit pushy trying to get us to order dessert. Anyway, ultimately we had a good time, but for what I paid, and for the fact that I only liked a few things, I don't feel it was worth it. I'll never go back. The whole time I was sitting there I was wishing I was at The Purple Pig. Now, there's a fun place with exciting food to share and believe me, you get your money's worth there. Still, it was an experience."
"Was so excited to go while visiting Chicago. Had tried to get a reservations- but was traveling alone and decided to get there early and grab a seat at the bar. They say they open at 4, but you can't be seated at a table or bar until 4:30. There was no rush and I set out to enjoy a variety of plates. First up, the oysters with bacon - so sweet and they had a great kick from the horseradish. Â Second I had the scallops with Brussels - this was amazing!!!! So many flavors and done to perfection. I'd have that over and over again! Lastly, I had the goat belly with crab - so good! First time having goat and now the bar is set very high!!!The bartender was great and we had fun pairing each course with an incredible wine! Thanks Girl and the Goat for a fabulous dining experience!"
3 month reservation time. Excellent food!
"Delicious! Great service and atmosphere! Been twice now and have equally enjoyed both experiences. A few favorites: escargot ravioli, pig face and goat empanadas! Enjoy!"
"Totally lives up to all the hype. Go and order as many dishes as you can and sit back and enjoy. This is what food is all about. If you are a foodie or just trying something new you can't go wrong here. Stephanie's food is the real deal. Go early, they reserve a lot of tables for walk-ins and have a great bar. Also try booking a table the day of. Cancellations can be your friend here. Good drinks, great food, casual atmosphere. I'm glad I don't live in Chicago... I'd be there all the time."
"Came here on a Saturday night with the boyfriend after having made reservations almost 2 months in advance (the only time we managed to get by the way was 10pm). We weren't seated right away, had to wait about 20 minutes, which wasn't bad. It was slammed that night even though it was so late.When we were finally seated, we ended up at a table near the kitchen (which was pretty awesome: open kitchen), it was a sight to see for sure. Our waiter apologized for the wait though we weren't bothered by it. We ordered right away we were so hungry: apple smacks bread, grilled seared ahi tuna, diver scallops, and wood oven roasted pig face. Each dish came out one by one with a food runner explaining what they had placed in front of us which I thought was nice. Surprisingly midway through our meal our waiter had come to give us an order of sauteed green beans we did not order. He said the green beans were on him because he felt bad for our wait. We were shocked! We in no way ever complained for having to wait to be seated so this was a nice surprise. We topped off our evening with dessert: bittersweet chocolate.This place seriously has the best food I have ever eaten with the most courteous and friendly staff. Amazing service! Top notch!"
"I really wanted to love this place. The hype was other-worldly, and I figured it had to be an amazing dining experience given the insane wait (I had to book our reservations about three months out). When ReservationDay finally arrived, I was annoyed with myself that I fell for the hype. On the other hand, my husband and I absolutely *love* The Little Goat and have been there twice--and, we will be going back.The food was nowhere near as spectacular as I'd envisioned, it was much too loud to try to carry on a conversation, and I wasn't a fan of the rustic-y atmosphere. On top of that, the seats were noticeably dirty, the cleanliness of the table was questionable, the appetizer plate was incredibly-spotty (I'm not just nit-picking--the plate looked like it completely missed the rinse cycle in the dishwasher), and my fork had bent tines. On the other hand, I hate that I didn't write down his name, but our server was AMAZING. Â Long story short, it just wasn't the dining experience that I expected. I may give it another try in the future, dunno."
"Wow. Wow. Wow. Â I'll try to keep this short and sweet since I could clearly go on and on about this place for a while.Made reservations over a month ago. Had a Monday night slot at 7:30. Place was packed and a bit on the loud side (couldn't hear music) but not uncomfortably. Arrived early to enjoy a sazerac at the bar...and was seated on time. Requested a kitchen view table and got it. Â Happy girl :+)This table to me, was THEEE best seat in the house. Â Being a foodie, I was able to appreciate seeing food prepped, ask questions, and receive small samples from the uber cool chefs in front of me. Â I was on cloud 9...literally. Ordered way more than necessary.More on this later. Â Long story short, I've been back over a dozen times and every time was better than the last. Â If Brendan ever stops working there, I have no idea what I will do.Love all you guys there!!!"
"Inventive but often misses the mark. I tried four dishes; two were acceptable, one was good, and one was excellent:The kona kampachi crudo was an interesting concept, but the execution was a bit lacking. The tart notes from the citrus and fish sauce were somewhat overpowering and those notes lingered even after the food was gone. Certainly a dish targeted for palettes accustomed to Asian cuisine (i.e. palettes okay with unbalanced, overpowering flavors).Pan-fried shishito peppers sounded great, like padron peppers in Spain. Unfortunately, the quality imparted from the pan--the slightly crunchy and bumpy texture from being blistered in a hot pan--was completely lost when the peppers were baked with their crust of cheese. The peppers and cheesed turned into a soggy, salty mess. They were edible only when accompanied by a refreshing beer.The kohlrabi salad was a touch better though it could have used a bit more citrus (perhaps some from the kampachi crudo) to balance out the sweetness of the dressing and apple slices.The standout dish of the night was the wood oven-roasted pig face. At worst, it was slightly too sweet and the instruction to chop it all up (someone couldn't have done this in the kitchen or at the table?) was a bit off-putting, but the meat was cooked excellently and the flavors really came together. People who love breakfast for dinner (not me) would probably freak out over this dish.Overall, a mixed bag. I'd come back, but don't expect an amazing experience as most of the reviews overrating the restaurant suggest."
"I loved the Girl & the Goat. Â It sucks that you have to wait a couple of months to get in, but it was worth the wait! The food was crazy, fun, and extremely tasty. Â I made another reservation when I was leaving the restaurant."
"Busy, busy place - per expectations. However, we were seated essentially on time for our reservation, and somehow were nice enough to score one of the two chef's tables! Totally different experience in my opinion - but an extremely unique and fun visit. The cooks are extremely busy, but we chatted with them on and off, and they served us a couple items, but not many things. Great to see the workings of the restaurant though - super cool experience. Be prepared to be hot though, it's sitting right in a kitchen!We probably over-ordered a little bit, though according to our waiter that seems pretty normal. The freshly made bread was pretty amazing, but very dense. Worth every bite, but more filling than expected. The sugo dish was possible my favorite. It was put together with freshly made pasta and a meat sauce - well seasoned (lots of parmesan), and well portioned between the meat and pasta. The green beans were a little oily, but perfectly cooked (al dente), and we scooped them all up. I wasn't a huge fan of the fried pickles, but only because they were tempura fried, not breaded. It wasn't what I was expecting - and it did taste good - just not a star; however, the harissa sauce accompanying the pickles was fantastic.Everyone is going to see and like different dishes here - I would have tried the pig face, but that was shot down by my dining partner. Everything we had was extremely good. The textures and the flavors were well thought out and all of the dishes were well constructed. I'm not sure that you could go wrong with anything - even the dish that I wasn't super fond of was very good, and all the rest were stellar.Service here is impeccable, the wait staff was appropriately asking for refills and clearing plates. But never did it feel stuffy. It's a great atmosphere to relax and have a good meal. You could easily show up in a suit and tie, but also be very welcome in jeans and a t-shirt. It was a pretty expensive meal, but again based on expectations it wasn't extreme. You do get what you pay for, an extremely good meal, with very good service! I'm not sure my pocketbook can withstand becoming a regular here, but it definitely is on the list of places to return to."
Knowledgeable staff. Who not only passed over the Gluten free menu but were able to tell me a bit about it. I enjoyed my dining experience but need to remind everyone to make a booking well in advance if you want to give it a try.
"I formally petition ""YELP"" to add the ""HOL"" category (see my previous review) ~ Until then....five HUGE starsI'm smitten! Â At this point, I'm confident that there isn't anything on the menu that you could bring me that I wouldn't YELP up with abandon. (I don't know why I just typed YELP there except for the fact that - when you find you are so satisfied and delighted with a place...you want to let the world - and the amazing restaurant, itself Â - know.)Service - outstanding Â  *Kudos for knowing the menu so well, making guests feel comfortable and for not doing the up-sell. Host staff too - gave us three minute notice while we waited at the bar so we could close our table and get ready to move. Food - amazing Â *Next time, I'm seriously getting every bread they offer. I don't usually enjoy fruit in bread, but the ""Apple Smack"" was right on. Also, I'm terrible about ordering the same items every time at many restaurants - but not here! (Well, yes, did get the shishito peppers as those are light, can light you up, and because they keep excellently for days in the fridge.) At G & the G though, I'm much more trusting to try other menu offerings. One, I find: the flavors, exquisitely married....the combinations, unexpected (scallops, fried brussels sprouts, pom seeds, pumpkin brandade & pepitas) ... and value, extraordinary ($17 for two large scallops). Very reasonable portion to price, especially given the taste, masterful creativity and the current demand for the place. Â I've tried ""grilled octopus"" at three restos in the city and this, by far, was the best. Â I've yet to get a great ""wood oven roasted pig face"" anywhere else and next time - Walter, that chicken is mine!Ambiance - welcoming Â  Â  *I like the easy-going ""not trying too hard"" warmth of the large open space, but it is a bit noisy - (right behind the hostess stand, there's only about six tables and if the bar patrons aren't loud, this is a much quieter spot when dining.) Have never made it to dessert here, but a yelper buddy mentioned ""pork ice cream"" so that's a must if it's on the menu next time. Oh, pray the ""next time"" comes soon. Until then...HOL!"
"Is it weird that I liked Little Goat better? The food is hard to compare seeing as how Little Goat is fancier diner food and Girl and the Goat is just fancy food. I did like that we could share several plates and my husband thought that by doing so the prices didn't seem super outrageous. He thought he was going to be spending more than we actually did. The wait staff is very knowledgeable and nice, and although it isn't community seating it was hard to have a conversation with my husband because it was loud. I liked the hamachi with pork belly. My husband really enjoyed the broccoli. It was smokey and savory. I was a little disappointed with my escargot ravioli. The pasta was a little hard. Â The ham frites were a little misleading because it was in the meat section but it was more like fries dusted with bacon bits? Don't think we didn't finish it because they were still addicting with the beer cheese dip. We did enjoy the dessert though. The budino was very yummy."
"I AM MOVING TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD TO EAT HERE. ...I would if I could, actually, since this was one of the best meals of my life, and if it weren't such a pilgrimage for us to get here, I'd probably reserve a table here every week. It's way too affordable for the amazing food that is created here. Even my boyfriend, someone who doesn't really care for food, was amazed at this place. We raved about how this was the best meal we've ever had the entire drive home. We had Not-Campbell's bread - soft, moist, warm bread with 2 pretty good sauces. Then we had chickpea fritters, scallops (surprisingly small scallops though), goat belly (goat and lobster whothinksofthat), and pig face. Then, we opted for the fried oysters anyway, which we were on the fence for since I don't care for fried oysters but I LOVED this. Everything tasted PERFECT, really well balanced, even the fatty butter/goat belly/lobster was not overwhelming. I don't really remember much details because the food was just so good there was no time to scrutinize before all of it was in my tummy. Mmmmmm.Flavor-wise, I couldn't complain about a single part. Super balanced and perfect. I wish the portions were bigger though, even for smaller plates. Split between 2 people, I felt myself wanting just a bit more. Maybe it was just so good here, but I don't usually have that problem at other tapas places. The vibe is really chill, with actual burnt wood walls (we thought it was fake until poking at it left us with blackened fingers...ooops) And this place is LOUD - they fit a lot of tables in here pretty close to each other, and the place is always packed, even at 11PM when we were on our way out. We totally splurged on many of the more expensive items + dessert and espresso, and it was only $50/person before tax/tip! But for a normal meal for us it could easily be $30/person, and I spend that amount on crappy chinese take out sometimes out of indecision -.-;"
"The food has always been good! Have a little complaint though: the server told TWO of us (each of us weighs under 130 pounds) to order 4-5 dishes excluding bread, so we ordered Goat Belly, Pork Shank, octopus, and grilled broccoli. Holy... It would be enough for THREE people. In conclusion, the portion of each dish is not as little as you may expect!"
A long walk did my hunger well on my way there...Remember to rsvp ahead of time... and by ahead of time I mean a LOT of time. The wait and the walk both did so well that I could eat more than I probably had any right to.. The venue is nice.. a lot of dark ambiance and woody decor to make me feel nice and warm doing wonders for my appetite. We sat by the kitchen and enjoyed all they had to offer. They answered all our drunkenly repeated questions and told us all the I was a touch disappointed that the pig head was not an entire pig head but a slice instead... but it was no less delicious! The cut of the meat and the egg yolk is the perfect combination of pork and chicken. Everything was amazing! We had this ragu with gooseberries... WHAT are gooseberries and where were they my whole life. Baby octopus was equally tasty. I couldnt get enough of these little octupi. Â RSVP ahead of time.. get there and eat and drink and be merry. ;D
"I'm pretty sure that the 1197th review of Girl & the Goat is not going to help you decide whether or not to give Stephanie Izard's West Loop establishment a try. Â You should. Â And you will. Â What I CAN offer in this review is a little peek at the delicious offerings we had in December 2011 and tell you why this is such an amazing place to celebrate a special occasion.My fiancee and I had just gotten engaged and a friend of mine couldn't use her reservation so I jumped on it (thanks Colleen F!!). Â When they called to confirm the reservation she let them know that ""she"" had just gotten engaged-that's all it took for them to give us an incredibly memorable and special night.We were seated at the 2 counter seats right in front of the kitchen. Â The chef working at that station was very nice and friendly, offering suggesions and chatting with us throughout the meal. Â Our waiter was also super friendly, he greeted us with many congrats and 2 glasses of champagne on the house-the perfect way to start off the evening. Â He also treated us to our dessert of choice which made for a very *sweet* ending.In between we had several amazing dishes:*Chicken Little bread-chicken liver butter, carrot sage oil: Â I am not usually one to order dishes that have miscellaneous animal parts, such as liver, in their description-but since we were at Girl & the Goat I thought I'd give the chicken liver butter a chance and I'm so glad I did-it was DELICIOUS! Â The bread itself tasted like chicken soup and even had bit of chicken in it. Â Once you slather on the rich chicken liver butter it all just melts in your mouth. Â The velvety carrot sage oil was a nice contrast in taste to the butter-I love me some bread & butter but this was just above and beyond.*Pan Fried Shishito Peppers-parmesan, sesame, miso: Â Looking at the menu I don't think this is a dish I would have ordered on my own. Â While waiting for our table I happened to sneak a peak (ok, maybe I drooled a bit) at this dish being delivered to a nearby table. Â The peppers tasted just as delicious as they looked. Â Not incredibly spicy, but you do get a zinger here and there. Â Covered in melted parmesan and cooked to perfection, these were a definite win. Â *Chickpea Fritters-stewed chickpeas, pickles, red onion, crave brother's mozzarella: Â I had seen several great reviews about these fritters so we gave them a try and they did not disappoint!*Sweet n' Sour Cod Cheeks-bacon, potato aioli, tempura broccoli: Â AMAZING! Â My favorite dish of the night. Â Tempura fried cod that was deliciously flaky and buttery and bacon and potato aioli just added to the awesomeness. Â I could've eaten the entire plate myself.*Crisp Braised Pork Shank-butternut shiitake kimchee, buttermilk dressing: Â Yum! Â The pork was a little on the salty side, but it was still pretty darn good. Â The kimchee sauce that comes on the side is outstanding, we were just dipping the pita bread that came with straight in there. Â The shank was huge and the dish was more than enough for 2 people, probably perfect for 4.*Chocolate-Thai Chili Gelato-chocolate cake, peanut fluff, pomegranate, left hand milk stout: Â One of the best desserts I have ever had. Â The flavor combinations were unexpected but worked together perfectly. Â The spicy chocolate gelato was amazing and there was Â a crispy rice sprinkled on top that added the perfect little crunch. Â Add in a few pomegranate pieces and you have dessert perfection.To sum it all up, I can't wait to go back!!"
"Over a year of trying to get into this place, rave reviews, high expectations only to experience disappointment. First, the reason I gave it two stars is because the hostess was very gracious and there were a couple of very good dishes. However, the server was not qualified, lacked enthusiasm, and couldn't answer basic menu questions. Apparently, the sommelier was missing in action too and the server had no intention on offering an alternate wine expert. We ordered about seven dishes and each course that arrived contained more sodium than the previous dish. The ingredients were fresh, however, there was so much salt you couldn't decipher what the dish was trying to accomplish. Oh Girl and the Goat how thee disappointed me!"
"Girl and the goat is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Me and my wife went there for a date night on a Friday. We got seated right away (even without reservation). The service was great!! And the food is even better!!! The sautÃ©ed shrimp is one of the best I have ever had, the shrimp is tasty. The pig face is a must try dish! It is beautifully seasoned and served with a sunny side up egg on top. The combination is phenomenal! The goat belly is also really good. With lobster and crab, it delivers just the right balance of taste. You will just keep wanting for more!!!! It was a great experience for our date night. I will definitely want to go there again!"
"I made reservations for 7:30pm last Wednesday and we got there right on time but waited about 20 minutes for our seats as the general manager came up to us saying he had given our table away- never had that happen before, and odd it happened as such highly-acclaimed restaurant. Â But we got seated right after he talked to us and it wasn't a big problem since I wasn't as hungry. Â PLUS, we got seated two tables away from BOBBY FLAY so got to spy on what he was eating. Â The service was spot on throughout our entire meal, a smooth-flowing restaurant. Â They did not take a dish off our table until we actually finished eating the entire dish which I appreciated, and our dishes came out well-timed.The chef here does flavor and texture combinations really well. Â All the dishes had an interesting mix of ingredients I would never think to put together, and she adds different elements to make the dishes texturally perfect (all dishes had some kind of contrasting texture- like smooth w/ crunchy, crispy w/ creamy, etc). Â Here's what we got in order of what I liked the most: The PIG FACE- one of the BEST MEAT DISHES I've had in a LONG time. Â Stunning, my first bite was heavenly I must say. Â It's basically like two circular slices of moist sausage on top of swirls of tamarind, cilantro, and some other sauce, with crispy potato stix and a runny egg on top. Â The meat was super moist, fatty and flavorful, combined with the crunchy potatoes and creamy egg- amazing. Â The texture of the entire dish was perfect.Chickpea fritters- a MUST GET at this restaurant- it's this creamy hummus-like inside fried in a crispy batter on top of a tomato stew with fresh green chickpeas, sliced pickles and mozzarella.Goat Cheesecake- DELICIOUS. Â It was a simple deconstructed cheesecake with a circle of creamy, light cheesecake, on top of a delicious graham cracker crumble with caramel sauce and roasted beets. Â Roasted cauliflower- great mix of cauliflower, mint, and pine nuts. Â I'm a sucker for any cauliflower dish but they made it really well here. Â I loved the addition of the pine nuts and the hint of sweet mint.Kohlrabi salad- a mix of greens, thin slices of kohlrabi (like white radish) and almonds. Â My friend said she thought they put too much dressing on the salad, and I would agree, but it was really good and a unique dish- very refreshing, loved the crunchy almonds.Grilled octopus- this dish was a bit salty for my taste since it had guanciale (like prosciutto) it just made it a bit too salty for me. Â But the octopus was really fresh and I liked the beans in the dish."
"Phenomenal! Service, food, ambiance and experience are all five star. Must try at least one of the daily goat specialities. Do not leave without trying the pig face! This place is unforgettable in every sense and cannot wait to go back!"
Ate here recently with a client. Â We made plans to meet here at 4pm on a Thursday and had no trouble getting 2 seats at the bar at 6pm.She has a gluten allergy and I was really impressed by their gluten-free menu. Â The staff was fantastic and did a great job of staying on top of beverages and taking the time to explain the menu and ordering strategy. We had a few appetizers and shared an amazing pork shank. Â We also had a gluten-free coffee cake which was very good.Cool atmosphere. Great wine list. Excellent food. Everything you need for a great dining experience.
"I have been waiting to have dinner at G&G for several years. Took my team there last night. Everything was awesome. Great drinks, food and service. Pig face is a must try. The goat neck was amazing and seasoned well. Â Baby octo! Thanks for a great evening can not wait to come back."
This restaurant definitely was the highlight of my Chicago's trip. When anyone asks about Chicago the first thing that came of my mind is Girls and the Goat. Name of restaurant sounds funny but it was catchy. It's definitely a busy restaurant so either make reservation or grab a seat at the lounge/bar first come first serve. I remembered everything we ordered was delish! Don't forget to try the goat cheese cake.. That was to die for.!!
"Being an avid Top Chef watcher and a foodie, Girl and the Goat was on our to ""EAT"" list. . . We were not disappointed! Everything from the hostess, to our waitress, to our food was excellent!We started with miso bread - delicious. Then we moved onto the beet salad, scallops, and octopus. The beet salad was balanced and was not heavily dressed, which was nice for a change. The scallops were cooked to perfection. The octopus dish was good but was a little overcooked, which resulted in a rubbery texture. The entrees kept on coming in a timely manner. Our next course was the pig face, pasta with gooseberries, and goat leg. The pig face was the favorite of the table! It was sooooooo good! The pasta came as a close second; the pasta was perfectly al dente and the gooseberries . . . Really added a harmonious note of acid to the dish. The goat leg was ok, a little dry and bland. We ended with dessert, both were very good.Although our waitress prefaced upon ordering that their food was salty, it was REALLY sodium dense . . . So make sure you have some water at hand! Overall, we enjoyed our experience thoroughly and will definitely be back!"
"This place is great, ambiance is pretty, food is great. I would say it is well worth the wait for reservations, however I don't know if I would try it again."
"This place is a lot of fun. Â Hipster upscale attitude, noisy and fun vibe, and definitely a long wait Â if you don't have a reservation. Â  We knew we were chancing it, but figured that showing up at 5 pm we might catch a break. Â  Not a chance. Â This place was hopping even that early on a week night. Â We sat at the bar for two hours (once a seat opened up after 30 mins or so - we snagged it) Â and finally decided to just dine there after seeing and smelling all of the dishes being served around us.I'm going to start with that. dessert....order the apple buckle. Â The couple beside us had it and moaned with each bite! Â ""I'll have what SHE's having."" Â  Oatmeal graham streusel with a brown butter gelato. Â  OMG Â  Â The dishes were meant to share, and we did. Â A wood grilled broccoli with smokey bleu cheese and some spicy crispies. Â  Â Some grill seared ahi tuna with a pepper mushroom salad on the side was prepared perfectly and served the same. Â  Our absolute favorite dish of the evening was the ham frites.....thin fried potato's (in ham grease) with smoked tomato aioli and a cheddar beer sauce. Â  Â To die for. Â Literally. Â  :-) Â  Do not pass up an opportunity to try Girl and the Goat."
"I went here with a large group from work, we spilt probably 16-18 small plates and everything was delicious. We even braved the pig face which was an experience. The atmosphere is great, everyone that works there was friendly and the service was quick."
"""Goats gone wild. Â Whatever floats your goat. Â Ride the love goat."" Â I walked into The Girl & the Goat and saw all the wait staff in witty t-shirts. Â Those who know me (and my yelp reviews) know I love a good pun. Â So like Christopher Boone (from The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time) seeing 5 red cars in a row, I knew this was going to be a Super Good meal. Â My group of about 14 people couldn't get a reservation 1 week before our arrival in Chicago, so we opted to arrive at the restaurant at 5pm to sit at the bar and lounge area. Â By 530pm, the establishment was bustling. Â Corny Goat Cheese Mousse. Â Spread offenses aren't the only thing that has made a comeback. Â I find myself ordering different spreads at different restaurants and this blend was top notch.The Goat Leg. Â I swore this monstrosity weighed a couple of tons. Â It is served on a cutting board with 5 different dipping sauces. Â Each individual had a favorite dip that they preferred. Â However, the dressing wasn't needed because the meat falls right off the bone and has enough gusto to bring mute tongues back to life.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. Â This will melt your face off. Â Everything is better with a runny egg.Kalbi Style Beef Ribs. Â Stick to the ones from Korean restaurants.Hiramasa Crudo. Â We made a mistake and thought that the pork belly was the main ingredient in this dish. Softshell Crab. Â I dare you to find me someone who doesn't love softshell crab. Â Dare you.Braised Beef Tongue. Â Eating this will have you speaking in many different languages wondering how something can taste this good.Escargot Ravioli. Snails move too slow for my taste, but it seems my friends enjoyed this dish.Etc, etc. Â My group ordered more items which either 1. Escapes me at the moment or 2. Was off the main menu and I did not write it down.After all that, how do you have room for dessert? Â Thank goodness I did because the G.O.A.T. (Greatest Of All Time) dessert is The Girl & the Goat's chocolate bouchon which consists of foie fluff, salted toffee, milk chocolate sorbet, and gooseberry compote. Â After the first bite my mind was reeling. Â Then I battled depression because the caloric count must be through the stratosphere and because I would have to fly to Chicago just to have another taste. Â Oh, the pork fat doughnuts were hypnotizing as well.The servers knew the extensive menu like the back of their hand. Â They were quick to take our orders and refill our waters but also friendly to share some laughs."
I get tears in my eyes when I think about this meal. Â The most thought- out dishes I have ever experienced. Â Go here now. Order everything. Make reservations 2 months ahead.
"Stopped in for a solo dinner on Monday night. Found a seat at the bar around 6, the place was packed by 6:30. Many/most of the people at the bar were dining as well, which makes sense as you can't get a table in under an hour if you don't have a reservation.My order selections and my thoughts: - Â a ""mini"" of the escargot ravioli with bacon tamarind miso sauce (mini was suggested by the waiter since I wouldn't be sharing): a mini of this dish included 2 dollar sized raviolis in a small bowl with a broth-y sauce and a mess of fried shallots on top. the Escargots taste a bit like a very firm mushroom, with a little extra earthiness to the flavor. The dish was tasty, but primarily because of the salty, delicious miso sauce. The fried shallots gave some nice crispness to it all. The sauce was by far the winning component of the dish, I sopped it up with the bread from my bread/butter starter. I liked this dish but not enough that I would re-order it if I returned. Â - a starter of bread with fig butter with blue cheese and fennel compote: The bread (4 triangle pieces) was a lovely focaccia, that seemed house made with a light sprinkling of large flake salt on top. the butter had a light figginess about it, and to be honest I couldn't identify any blue cheese. I did love the fennel compote though. Would only suggest ordering this dish if you're wanting some bread with dinner (as I happened to be, so was very pleased). Otherwise, the butter alone is not remarkable enough to merit ordering. Â - A main course of roasted goat loin with mushrooms and pickled grapes: The loin was sliced into thin-ish medalions and sat atop a medley of grapes, jus, brussel sprouts, and possibly some other random veg. This dish came with very few mushrooms (despite being in the title), and I was surprised to receive brussel sprouts since they weren't in the description. Overall, it was delicious. The pickled grapes have a strong vinegar flavor to them, which was a nice way to slice through the richness and saltiness of the meal. The meat was served quite rare, which was nice (not sure if this is the norm, I don't cook much goat - but it was successful). - Glass of pinot noir (Macedon, I think): tasty, as a pinot noir should be. - Dark chocolate cake with shitake caramel gelato, also ""mini"": I may be getting the title of this wrong, as I was less focused on details by the time the dessert menu rolled around. I saved room for dessert because I had some amazing ice cream here last time I visited. I was glad I did. The cake seemed almost flourless, and had a salty kick to it (almost like a bitter chocolate sable...) The shitake caramel gelato only tasted like caramel, I wouldn't have identified any shitake if I didn't know. I'm not a person who loves sweet sweets, so the salty bitter cake offset the sweet of the gelato really nicely. I definitely at the whole thing. My solo dining bill was $56, after tip $68 (not sure how all those ""mini's"" priced out, I didn't look at the itemization). I thought the price was very fair for the quality of food and experience. Highly enjoy and recommend this place, the menu is always interesting."
"I literally had no expectations of this place, assuming that any TV personality chefs or winners usually has their quality of food going on an automatic downhill. Â However, we came here on a late dinner reservation, and the place was still jumpin' and jivin.' Â We were seated in a booth-like area, with nice foam-y seats. Â Our server was nice, but she seemed a bit unattentive in terms of checking up on us and such. Â We ordered 7 dishes, including: a roll of bread with lobster butter sauce and roumelade; Roasted Cauliflower (with pickled peppers, pine nuts, & mint); Chickpeas Fritters (with eggplant-tomatillo capanota, & Crave Brother's mozzerella); HiramasaCrudo (with crisp pork belly, aji chili, &caperberries); Grilled Baby Octopus (with guanciale, wax beans, radish, favas, & pistachio-lemon vinaigrette); Goat Chorizo Flatbread (with ajvar, peppers, green tomato, apricot, and fresh ricotta); Skewered Lamb Heart (with spiced black mission figs and charred tomatoes); and a Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (with a sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, and potato stix). Â Each dishes were beautifully presented, and since it was one of those 'tapas/sharing' dishes type of venue, this amount of 3 people were enough. Â the bread with the dip were forgettable (not worth in getting since it'll fill you up); the cauliflower had a hint of cheese and tasted like boiled potatoes, but could have had a little bit more seasoning; the Chickpea Fritters was actually one of my favorites, since there were some fried chickpeas and a fried cheese cube that was amazing; the HiramasaCrudo was another favorite, since it had nice little crunchy/crispy bits of pork belly (yum!); the grilled octopus was good, but a little more on the salty side (the saltiest out of all the ones we've tried); the flatbread was pretty darn good - not that savory, but it had a hint of taco meat seasonings throughout; the skewered lamb had bits of lamb, had that 'game-y' lamb flavor and was just 'eh, okay';and the Roasted Pig Face looked like a McDonald's sausage biscuit, but it actually tasted like a puck of greasy blandness - did not enjoy that dish at all. Â The dishes were about $16+ for each dish (kind of pricey), but a few favorites were found. Â An added note: the bathrooms downstairs were kind of dirty, so that was not good.+Chickpea Fritters+HiramasaCrudo+beautifully-presented dihses+avoid the restrooms!"
"I've had nearly everything on the menu and it's all amazing. There isn't a single dish that has let me down. You can throw darts at the menu and you'd at the very least get the best meal of your life. AT THE VERY LEAST, you'd get the best meal of your life. This place is JUST THAT GOOD. I don't even dare describe any of the dishes I had for my words would not do it any justice. I don't live in Chicago and this place makes me wish I did. You don't even break the bank by going here (average of 30-40 per person spent after tax and tip with no drinks). I've spent more at other places but the taste and value here is simply amazing. Whenever I go to Chicago, I will make sure to eat here at least once."
"Impressed!We shared 6 dishes (one on the house), 1 dessert and 2 drink between 2 girls! and we finished them! Food: BEST...Chickpea fritter (It doesn't sound exciting but boy! order this. You won't regret), scallop divers (who would have thought kimchee and avocado and butter go so well together) and the fennel salad (refreshing and really balance out other richer dishes we ordered)Service: Our server, Aaron?, was superb. I really like how he really knows the menu, makes us feel great about our selections, and he's really funny! Ambience: Great vibe. We were too girls chatting but it'd be great for date and bigger group too. It's pretty awesome really :)"
"After my amazing experience at the Little Goat, I kicked it into high gear and finally made a reservation for Girl & The Goat. I made the reservation on opentable.com and got in the Saturday after Thanksgiving at 615pm...but made the reservation 8-10 weeks in advance. It was SO worth it! Everything I had heard about how amazing this place was was validated.My husband and I ended up using the night to celebrate my new job, so weren't holding back on anything. He ordered the Rusty Nail as his cocktail, a VERY strong scotch drink with Drambuie (I thought it was awful but he loved it). I asked the waitress for a suggestion and she brought me I don't know what (it's not on the online menu) which I thought was very strong, so she was kind enough to put more chaser in there when she noticed I was drinking it very slowly.Me not being a meat-eater, I was worried there might not be much to order for me. But there was so much! We ordered the following:- Sauteed green beans (the fish sauce vinaigrette makes this amazing)- Shishito peppers (SO good, you just eat the whole thing)- Goat Blue bread (it's so cheap and so good you can't pass it up, the fig butter and onion jam were out of this world I would buy it packaged)- Grilled ahi tuna (my favorite of the night, they give you about 8 pieces, I could have eaten 15 as my entrÃ©e)- Loup de Mer (has a very fishy taste to it, but was served upon quinoa and currants which played the flavors together amazingly)- Pig Face (my husband had this and said it was his second favorite, to the below, but kept going on and on about how fantastic it was)-Confit Goat Belly (his absolute favorite, he was making faces like he was REALLY enjoying himself, to the point it was funny to watch)We didn't get dessert because we were going to an engagement party that evening, and were fully expecting the bill to be over $200 but surprisingly I think it was about $140. TOTALLY worth all that food, trying so many new things, and taking in the beautiful setting."
"Amazing vegi dishes, fish dishes, fire cooked oysters and great wine."
"I'm sorry but the food here is inconsistent. And, to be clear, I'm downgrading from 4 simply because I don't think it continues to deserve the hype. (If 3.5 stars were possible, I'd give it that.) Yes, the dishes are phenomenally creative, and as a rule that's what I seek out most of all. Sometimes that also means some significant misses in terms of ingredient combinations at G&G. But above all, we've noticed on repeat visits that food sometimes comes out way too buttery / greasy (for example, the roasted cauliflower).The interior design is spectacular and there's always a fun vibe. The wait and bar staff are consistently friendly and helpful. My advice: arrive early, hang around the bar and wait for seats to open up at the counter or couches. Pretty easy to get a full meal that way without having to reserve far in advance."
"Not that anyone needs a reminder of how great this restaurant is, but it was wonderful. We were able to change our 10:30 reservation to an earlier time since someone cancelled. When we arrived we were seated within two minutes. The restaurant is a lot larger than I pictured but clearly its impressive if they can fill that many seats constantly with only reservations. The service is professional and friendly. We ordered the following : chicken little, pig face, goat belly, green beans, and loupe de mer. They were all amazing! The food is very rich so its good it comes in small plate style. We were full from sharing four plates so we passed on dessert. If you get a chance to find space for a reservation, go. You won't be disappointed."
"Food and wine were delicious! 4 stars for pretentious, rude staff. Bartender behind the bar last night was downright rude to us and had a terrible attitude- guess we shouldn't have asked what his favorite dish was. Hostess was rude also. Servers were decent and attentive to filling our wine glasses."
"We made reservation 2 months in advance, 8 pm, upon recommendation from the foodie friends. We arrived at 7:30, the place was humming, no empty table in sight and after getting cocktails, we spotted 4 empty chairs, 2 on each side of the kitchen counter, and as our friends suggested, we asked to be seated there. Those were ""Napoleon seats"", the seats from there you could see the entire kitchen and all 10 chefs working their magic there. Wine list is impressive, waiting staff recommendations are superb, the food is impeccable and innovative, (c'mon, where else can you get DUCK TONGUES or Crispy Goat Belly!?) and we even were brought the Korean BBQ ribs as compensation for our choice of not traditional table. Did I say I love this place and ""I'll be back!?"""
"I don't think there's much that can be added to the reviews outside of ... YOU HAVE TO EAT HERE!!!! I am not a fan of fusion, but this place blew my socks away. There are now 2 fusion places I will eat at ... here and The Source in DC. Friends and I traveled to Chicago for a triathlon and to vacation and one of the friends kept on trying to get reservations here. I didn't know what the big deal was, but I was game for it when he said that he was able to get 9:30 dinner reservations. I thought that he was crazy for wanting to get dinner when i typically go to bed, but what the hell. I'm on vacation. The place was pretty loud and was busting at the seams. A bit too trendy with the graffiti style Girl and Goal mural and how everyone was dressed. But the food made up for the fact that I couldn't hear anything. EVERYTHING HERE WAS AMAZING. Looking back at the pictures, I think we might have ordered the whole menu. I'm still not sure if the place was tapas style or not, but that's how our group treated it. The stand out blow off your socks dishes of our dinner were:1. Hamachi crudo - the sweetness of the fish was balanced out with the small bite of saltness from the pork belly.2. pan roasted halibut - sweet, salty, and perfected cooked halibut that just flaked gently apart3. crisp braised pork shank - we were trying to get whatever marrow we could out of the bone because it was soo tastey.4. fried naked cowboy - I had my doubts on how good fried oysters would be. But with the mini egg salad bits - i don't think I've seen food disappear this fast before. 5. squash blossom rangoon - Think of the crappy crab rangoons you get from bad Chinese restaurants. Now take the wonton skins off and replace it with a squash blossom. And it elevates it from the dregs of panda express to the finest that fusion food could do. 6. Goat Belly dish - I can't remebmer what it was called, but it was on a special menu. But I don't know what magic went into this, but there was no gamy-ness of goat. It was smooth and a little sweeter then pork belly. Really made me re-iPeople went on and on about how good the pig face was. And it is tasty and well done, but it was on the bottom half of the favorite dishes ranking of the evening. And the list above is maybe a third of what we ordered. The deserts were okay as well. And okay in that they were amazing. But they weren't that level of amazing where you don't care how much pain you are in, you just want more of it in your belly. So in closing, Highly recommended! EAT HERE!"
"Think of your most intense sexual encounter, multiply that by 5, and then turn it into a culinary experience. Only then can you understand what it's like to dine at Girl And The Goat. Foodgasm doesn't even cover it by any means...It's more like a Foodkakke. (If you don't get this reference then don't bother trying to look it up) They're small sharable plates each more amazing than the next. Â Definitely advised to come with a group so you can taste as much as possible. The crew I came with feasted on roasted beets, mushroom ragout, grilled baby octopus, diver scallops, escargot ravioli, sautÃ©ed shrimp, and pan roasted whitefish to name a few. Really can't tell you to try one over the other as each dish that came out I claimed the same thing...""No,no, no...now THIS one is my favorite.""Really not much else I can say that hasn't already been said. GOAT is an acronym for Greatest Of All Time and although I can't quite claim that it's gotta be pretty damn close."
"It's very hard to get reservations at this restaurant but thankfully, we managed to squeeze in a meal here during our stint in Chicago. Â It is a fabulous restaurant and totally worthy of trying if you're in town. Â It's tapas style so it's perfect for sharing. Â We ordered quite a few items but I will say that the goat items are a must. Â Goat, you say? Â Yes, goat.!! Â I was as surprised as any by how succulent and delicious this type of meat was. Â Goat carpaccio and confit goat belly are to die for. Â Evidently, the restaurant has their own farm somewhere in the outskirts of Chicago. Â The texture of the goat carpaccio was as good any any beef carpaccio I've had. Â And the goat belly? Â Wow!!! Â It's supple and rich. Â It's like a blend of pork belly and wagyu style beef. Â Just a beautiful dish.Culture club is beer infused butter. Â Beer and butter together? Â How can you go wrong? Â We had quite a few dishes but the stand out of the non-goat dishes was the pig face. Â Yup, pig face!!! Â I thought this would be tough and hard to eat but much to my surprise it was tender and melted in your mouth. Â Who knew pig face could taste so good! Â This restaurant is a culinary adventure into the non-traditional. Â However, there are also excellent variations of standard fare such as green beans. Â The very sparing splatter of fish sauce on this dish gave it a nice pop. Â Slightly tangy but quite flavorful. Â Octopus and chickpea fritters were nothing to write home about but the beef tongue was pretty good.All in all, Girl & the Goat is a wonderful addition to the Chicago dining scene."
"Girl and A Goat's menu is luxurious and decadent... Get ready to be Turned On in the most splendiferous fashion!Rich savory pork and flavorful sensuous Goat dishes are orgasmically delightful! The Crispy Pig Face - Crisp Pork, Red Wine Maple Sauce with potato stix - absolutely heavenly and quite possibly the most delicious thing I have eaten EVER!. The Confit Goat Belly was a sinfully flavorful combination Bourbon butter, lobster, crab and shaved fennel was a close second.I ordered the Spicy Shishito Peppers and the green beans, which were perfect accompaniment to the mouthwatering, heavenly meat dishes.For dessert The Butterscotch boudino with Bacon toffee and candied cashews was OMG and took me to a new high!Every sumptuous and scrumptious bite was truly a sensuous experience! The service was friendly, the staff was super nice, I could not have asked for better!"
I've been here four times and the food is always top notch. Â We even got a table next to John Legend last time we dined.
"Great service, super vibe. Â Place is hopping with energy. Â Service was exceptional. Â Pricey, 3 month wait, but well worth it. Â Treat yourself...."
"I decided to do a double banger...going to Purple Pig the night before followed by Girl & the Goat the following night. Â I was in from out-of-town, so needless to say, I do not have a reservation. Â I thought I would just ask if there would be a chef's table available since it was so touted on Yelp and I most certainly want the experience of personalized chef entertainment and tastings, but LOL, I was informed it would be at least a couple of hours. Â I'm glad I got there early because I found my little happy spot in the lounge, which is not only comfy, but the ideal spot for people watching. Â This is just an inviting little territory...random people sitting together on couches and we all end of sharing not only the evening together, but sharing the dishes too--you know, it's all like, ""You have to try this!"" and you quickly get over sharing food with strangers. Â And, I had a hot waiter that looked so much like Hugh Jackman...I was ready for him to bust out his claws in his Ride the Love Goat Tshirt. Â They only offer a few wines by the glass, but I was content with my Malbec. Â Sadly, none of the cocktails on their list were particularly tempting--seemed to be all creative concoctions but nothing particularly sexy..meh. Â I had been well prepared by other yelp reviews, so I knew ordering one of the bread/butters of the day was a must. However, I had no idea I would really fall in love with the bread the way I did. Â It was a warm gravid loaf packed with oomph and paired with a temptuous mushroom butter--another loaf please!!! Â Then I gulped down a quad of chilled oysters with a subtle mignonette. Â Next, Kona Kampachi Crudo...now you had me at crisp pork belly, but topping it over a little Hawaiian Yellowtail sushi...genius--of course I was trying to make it my goal to get a piece of pork belly with every bite. Â My favorite of the night...confit goat belly...just put it your mouth! Â This was a duo of tender goat belly cradled next to a bed of lobster and lump crab tossed with fennel and bourbon butter...need I say more. I find that I pretty much love anything ""belly"" anyway. Â Now, I'm not a lasagna kind of girl, but the Sugo was like a totally souped up captivating lasagna. Â I totally ran out of room to try the pig face, but perhaps next time...the guy next to me ordered it and loved it...he offered me a bite...definitely regret passing that one up. Â  Â The Goat has found it's way into my heart...definitely a ""must try"" in Chicago. Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard earned her stars with me and will not disappoint."
I was going to give this place a 4 but the food and drinks were SO good I bumped them up to 5...The service some what lacked...bus boy and waitress had a lot of room for improvement....Overall great food and drinks to the point!
"Wow! What a meal! I made a reservation 3 months in advance for this dinner and it was well worth the wait. My boyfriend and I are HUGE Top Chef fans and were very excited to finally try Girl and the Goat. This place definitely lives up to the hype!We had a 9:00 reservation and had a small wait once we checked in. Once we were seated our waitress was very friendly, attentive, and had great suggestions. I was really impressed that she asked us if we had any food allergies before we ordered. I have a dairy allergy and she was able to direct me away from dishes that contained dairy. This is the sign of a top notch restaurant! My two favorite things we ordered were the ham frites and the wood oven roasted pig face. The ham frites are the best french fries I have ever had with the most amazing sauces to dip in. Â Although heavy, the pig face was a wonderful combination of meat, eggs, and potatoes. It had unbelievable seasoning! Other dishes we tried were the pretzel bread, escargot ravioli, potato dumplings, diver scallops, and shrimp. The escargot ravioli is definitely worth trying! The potato dumplings were good and have some asian seasoning to them. The shrimp dish was very unique with hummus, tomatoes, and a sesame bread. The scallops were great with avocado and other garnish and excellent seasoning.My boyfriend and I left the meal full and satisfied by our wonderful dining experience.We will definitely be back in 3 months when we can get another reservation!"
"First of all, I have to confess I didn't order any of the goat menu items here, which I know is almost sacrilegious at a restaurant called Girl and The Goat. But I definitely will next time. Because we'll be back.We finally made it here after a three-month wait for reservations. It was absolutely worth it, but I wish we'd visited this place before it got ""discovered."" I guess that's what we get for living out in the boonies.We started out with fresh-baked breads - a wheat loaf and an onion roll served with a variety of chutneys and flavored butters. Both loaves had soft fluffy insides and crusts so crispy I was covered with crumbs. The menu is divided into vegetable, fish and meat dishes and we made sure we ordered several samples from each category. For veggies, we began with the warm marinated olives, which went well with the bread and the bottle of 2011 Bernaud Baudry Cabernet Franc we ordered. We also tried the chickpea fritters with stewed greens and goat cheese, and the roasted cauliflower. This last dish was definitely not my mother's cauliflower, which I remember as being either bland and tasteless (sorry, Mom!) or smothered in Velveeta cheese sauce. This cauliflower was alive with pickled peppers, mint and other herbs that really gave it a kick. Even my husband, who doesn't go for many vegetables as a rule, liked it.The other husband in our group was not much of a seafood fan, so we kept it conservative in this category with the diver scallops (accented with shiitake mushrooms and bok choy) and the arctic char. Our meat dishes were the beef short ribs (tender and flavorful with onion salad and pickled mushrooms) and one of the restaurant's specialties: pig face. This is actually a high-end version of bacon and eggs, with a sunny-side-up egg served over two wood oven-roasted pork patties (made from, yes, the meat of a pig's face, including the tender tongue and cheek muscles) sandwiching a mound of crispy potato sticks, all of it seasoned with tamarind vinaigrette, cilantro oil, and red-wine maple gastrique. What a blend of unlikely yet synchronized flavors! Don't be afraid to order this! Cut it all up, mix it together, and chow down! We ended the meal with the bittersweet chocolate cake with toffee and shiitake-caramel gelato. Anything with chocolate is good, but adding shiitake to it makes it even more memorable. Â  Portions are small-plate size, but after nine courses and two bottles of wine we were stuffed. The prices were pretty reasonable for such a trendy place, too.Although I'm not much of a cocktail person, the cocktail menu here looked very interesting. One of our dining companions had a potent and aromatic concoction called a Double Barrel, made with bourbon, cognac, ginger, and bitters, which I'll have to try the next time I'm here.The dÃ©cor is a sort of trendy industrial/rustic look, with brick walls in the waiting area, charred wood walls in the dining section, exposed overhead pipes, and dim lighting. The atmosphere is very lively and active, bustling with people. The only drawbacks to this place were the rather meager wine pours (my pre-dinner aperitif was an $11 glass of Malbec that I probably could have finished in two swallows if I hadn't hoarded it) and the loud noise level, although that's to be expected in a place this popular. But those are minor downsides in a restaurant this good. I think Stephanie Izard is on her way to a Michelin star rating!"
"Came here for dinner during a bachelorette party while we were in town. Our server was exceptional! She took great care of us from start to finish. We ordered a bunch of different plates and they were ALL magically scrumptious! To top it off, the toffee dessert was phenomenal! Â If you are in the area, I urge you to stop by and have a meal of a lifetime. You will not be disappointed, I guarantee it!"
"6:30 pm on a Thursday, the place was already packed and VERY, VERY LOUD!! Â If you're looking for a quiet, peaceful meal, or you're not a particularly adventurous eater, this may not be your kind of place. Duck tongues and pig face (no, there is no ""face"" looking back at you) may sound strange, but taste great. Ditto fried squash blossoms and baked cauliflower. Everything is served as a ""small dish"", intended to be shared. Four dishes are enough for two, in most cases. And the T-shirts are clever (but expensive). Make a reservation."
"Repeatedly lied to about being seated. After an hour and a half of waiting, we were seated with another group (yes, one whole group). We walked out after that."
"Beautiful restaurant. Great staff. Everything was very gourmet. Here was what I had. I'm starting off with dessert bc it's absolutely to die for. 1. Miso-butterscotch budino with bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashew. 6/5. To die for. 2. Kona kampachi crudo- pork belly. 5/53. Roasted cauliflower. Has pickled peppers , pine nuts, mint. Eat it all in a bite! 4/54 Wood oven pig face- not fatty or greasy at all! 5/55. Kali beef ribs- eat with the okra together! Super soft and tasty Â 5/56. Escargot ravioli- not chewy soft great sauce. 4/57. Â Goat confit- came w lobster. 3/5"
"One of the best dining experiences I've had. Every item is masterfully executed, from their cocktails to their bread. Â I've been the past two years when we travel up to Chicago for a convention and will continue to return (if we can get in). Â The staffis also spot on, you can really tell they are passionate about what they are serving. Â One of the most admirable things about this place,, however, Â is that you will actually see chef Stephanie Izard there working! Â  It seems to be the norm that celebrity chefs that have their names on restaurants are rarely seen there, Â but you can really tell that chef Izard is a true beast in the kitchen! Â Respect!"
"Went here with the hubby for our anniversary dinner and loved it!! Â Everything was really delicious. Only item that I wasn't all that crazy about were the beef ribs. Â Here's what we had:Rye bread - excellent. Â Loved the salmon spread more than the relish which was still good. Â It was great to get a still warm loaf of bread.Warm olives - yummy!Goat empanadas - delicious!! Roasted cauliflower - absolutely amazing and I asked for a to go box for the remaining 4 bites ... that good!A fish dish with cauliflower - don't remember the type of fish. It was slightly fried with some veggies. It went really well with the roasted cauliflowerBeef ribs - just ok. A little overcookedLamb ribs - really really yummy. Â Peach cobbler - the sour cream ice cream was unexpected but thought it was paired well.Favorites were probably the goat empanadas, the fish dish, and roasted cauliflower. Hubby's was the goat empanadas.Service was excellent and the server was really helpful in pointing out her favorites. Â Loved the ambiance and the decor :) Â Highly recommend it!"
"I can't believe I have never written a review for G & the G! Shame... seeing that this place has already garnered 1000+ reviews filled with lavish praises, what more can say...Some useful tips:1) If you want to dine at prime time, make advance reservations. And I mean like 3 months ahead. Their availabilities are shown on OpenTable 3 months out. We make our reservations 3 MONTHS in advance each time so that we can eat at a more normal time say at 7pm. If advance reservations that far out don't work for you, your options will look like either a 5:15pm or 10:15pm seating, IF you're lucky enough to even have those availabilities left to choose from.2) If it's just two of you in your party, I highly recommend requesting for kitchen counter seats. They have two sections of kitchen counter seating; one at the entree section (right side) and another at the dessert/appetizer section (left side). Either side is great though the right side has more stuff going on (think sizzling, grilling, etc). Each time we dined at the kitchen counter, we received a couple of additional dishes with compliments of the kitchen. This is a very nice gesture of the restaurant as it creates a somewhat personal and appreciative relationship. During one of our meals at the counter on the right side, we had a great interactive dining experience with the chefs as well.Despite G & the G being such an overly hyped restaurant in Chicago, it has a lot to live up to. And it does!"
"The food is excellent, the ambiance is energetic and undeniably cool, but good luck getting-in.If you do get in, go a little early and have a drink at the bar, to get the full experience. If you are patient, just walk-in and ask for a table. You might wait in the bar for an hour, but that's not a bad thing and it is worth the wait!"
"Perfection.From the wonderful warm but modern decor to all of the friendly people working there and most importantly the delicious food - it was a perfect night.We had the cauliflower, goat empanadas, pig face and scallops. All perfectly executed and delicious. My fav was the pig face with the cauliflower coming in at a close second. We also had to get two desserts, clearly. Double chocolate cake (holy moly) and pumpkin gelato were a perfect ending to our meal.Can't wait for the little goat! Bahhhhh!"
"There is so much hype surrounding this restaurant, that would be very difficult not to disappoint. The food was good. Everything was fresh and balanced and perfectly prepared. The ambiance, however, was terrible. I must admit that I may just be too old for this restaurant. Â My girlfriend later told me that when we stepped through the front door, and heard how loud it was, she knew I wouldn't enjoy the experience. Â Throughout the evening, I could barely hear my date, & I had a hard time understanding the waitress. Â We were seated directly behind the maitre'd station and lodged up against a half railing separating the restaurant from the bar. So all evening long we had people standing in the bar kind of looming over us. Because the restaurant was so loud, those standing in the bar had to yell to be heard so it was like they were yelling directly at us.Our waitress wasn't rude, but she wasn't that engaging and we didn't feel we could use her to get any recommendations on the menu. The menu itself was not approachable. Â The drink list was lackluster and we didn't order anything from it. Instead of having to choose from all the wonderful choices, we ended up just picking the five items that looked the least gross. Â Even then the stuffed calamari came out looking ""Like a poop, stuffed with poop, covered in poop. And lettuce.""Overall I found the place to be pretentious and self-congratulatory."
"I've been to Girl and the Goat twice now. The place is definitely over-hyped...I made reservations 3 months in advance each time I went and I don't think the food is so out of the world that a 3 month wait is worth it. Still, the food is decent and the service is very warm, knowledgeable, and professional. My only real Â complaint is about the food...it's extremely rich and somewhat over seasoned. This is coming from someone who LOVES rich food. If you're looking for a great small plate place that doesn't require 3 months of planning ahead, try The Purple Pig (they have a wider selection of food and, honestly, I think it's better)."
"Really 4 1/2 stars but you can't 1/2 star something so there. Â A group of three of us went there this past Sunday on our Orioles trip to Chicago. Â A party of three of us made a 9:15 reservation on the Monday before we left (unheard of apparently for this place) and were seated within minutes of our arrival. Â The place was packed, the interior is hip/chic, complete with comfortable seating and an open kitchen. Â The music focused almost exclusively of 90's early 2000's rap which is fine for our table but I could see being oft-putting to some. Â Beyond that it was too loud, especially for a restaurant already noisy from the large crowd and high ceilings/cement floors. Â We all had to raise our voices to hold conversation, again this is 9-11:30 on a Sunday night. Â 1/4 star off. Â The wait staff was attentive yet unobtrusive. Â Water was promptly filled as well as wine. Â The staff also made good use of the space, bringing and removing food like a well-orchestrated epicurean carousel. Â Pig, goat, snail, and deserts, all were delicious and ranged from the heavy to mid-heavy range, don't go here if you are looking for simplistic, minimalist cooking. Â The flavors are intricate and can range from the potent to the subtle. Â The girl can sure cook. Â Some things are complete homeruns while other dishes simply were hits. Â There were a couple of dropped balls (the bread we ordered never came though we weren't charged, they were out of the goat shank, and the wine we ordered though try the girl's Walla Walla blend it is quite good), and the place is a bit pricey but not outrageous for the quality and the overall experience.Food: Exceptional-really it is very goodService: Attentive, unobtrusive but not quite perfectAmbiance: Fun, lively, loud perhaps too loud for someOverall: I'd definitely go back, it's a fun experience with a good vibe even if a bit trendy. Â The food is truly delicious with complex flavors and wonderful presentation. Its expensive but not overly considering the meal and the demand"
"The hype, the high expectations, the long wait; it all means something and in this case it means truly, creative delicious food! This is one of those places I want to keep secret, because it's a great place to impress anyone."
"I was really curious about G&G since some of my friends loved it and some just thought it was okay. All I gotta say is that the veggie dishes are better than the meat ones in my opinion. I thought the pig face is over-hyped (yelp.com/biz_photos/qjnpâ¦). Â It wasn't bad, just thought it'll be amazing from all the talk about it but I still dream about how yummy some of the veggie dishes like the cauliflower (yelp.com/biz_photos/qjnpâ¦) or chickpea fritters ( yelp.com/biz_photos/qjnpâ¦) were. My fave protein dish was the goat belly confit which was amazing ( yelp.com/biz_photos/qjnpâ¦)Overall, a good experience. I definitely won't mind coming back."
"Food was good, just not sure what all the hype is about. Â Some of our plates were a bit too salty for our liking. Â The atmosphere was great and very vibrant. Â The service was so-so (it was very crowded, but then again it always is), and we were mostly struck by the waitresses response that she was more familiar with beer and tequila than wine when asked for some recommendations. Â However, she go and get the sommelier, who was very helpful. Â Overall, it's a fine restaurant, but I'm not sure it's one of those spots you need to make a reservation 30 days in advance."
"Wow, I think I just had the best pancakes I've ever had in my life!Great food, service, and ambience."
"Had a terrific time here on a recent trip to Chicago. The details are not important, as it was kind of a unique experience (10:30p reservation, arrived early, sat at chef's table).The big picture: beautiful space, terrific staff, delicious food, and reasonable price. Made for a wonderful night out with my wife."
"I know, I am the last Chicagoan to visit the Girl and The Goat. Well, I have finally made it! My husband and I went last night after making reservations in January, haha, we were obviously in no rush. I was surprised by how big it is considering you have to wait forever for a reservation. The space is nice, I like the layout and it is neat to be able to see the kitchen. We saw Stephanie back there working, which was cool too!We started with the Onion Brioche and it was awesome. It tasted like an onion croissant! The tarragon butter and red pepper chutney were great compliments. Since I am a carb lover, we ate the whole thing. So, I was a little disappointed since 43745894 people have told me I HAVE to get the Pig Face, it wasn't on the menu. Our waitress said they sold out on Tuesday, the night before. Lame. Haha, jk. Whatever. So we went with:Beet Salad, really good! All the right components, crunch, savory, sour, sweet. Yum and super light, which is needed since the rest of the stuff we got was heavy!Goat Emanadas, yum! Can't go wrong with anything fried, really. They tasted a lot better than the goat I tried in Mexico that was a little bit (ok a lot)chewy, haha. Super tender and I love the sauce it came with.Tempura Lupe de Mer: A friend recommended this. They say it is like sweet and sour chicken, but with fish. It was really good and something like I have never had before. The fish was cooked perfectly and it was delicious!Cauliflower: Okay, so everyone raves about this, but I am not sure why. It was fine. But nothing spectacular. The peppers in it were good. It was a huge amount of cauliflower. Suge: My favorite thing! I mean, me and papardelle are hard to separate. I can't get enough, it had goat, beef, and pork, all really tender and shredded in it. Lots of homey goodness. Miso Butterscotch something or other: Soooo good! Super light and fluffy, loved the pineapple. Great way to end a meal!Overall, glad we finally made it. I wouldn't stand around for hours, I would rather wait 3 months and make a reservation and wait. The music is super interesting. A mix of everything, we even hear a Lion King song I think last night! It was really loud though, kinda hard to hear. So that was a negative. But I am old, well, not really. Oh the staff is great here, so friendly and quick to pick up dirty plates and bring us new ones and fill up our water, but not like the annoying guys who fill it up when you have taken one drink just to pour a bunch of ice in it. No ice here. Just how I like it."
Food is as good as advertised. Worth the wait
"I have wanted to eat here for a very long time, so when I learned that you don't need reservations for the bar seats, I dragged my hubby on over. We only waited 5 minutes on a Saturday evening, and got a great seat at the bar. They also have seats at a couch on the side that are also first come first serve. The first question the server asked was ""Is there any foods either of you cannot have?"" Â I happen to have Celiac Disease and am gluten-free, so I said, ""Yes, I stay away from gluten"". The server went further to ask if I avoid it by choice or for medical reasons, because they grill items on the same area and there may be cross contamination. Â Also they use a fish sauce that contains wheat in some dishes. I was floored! I have never felt so safe eating in a restaurant before. They have a great idea of food allergies and have a separate GF menu, and can answer any questions you may have. We ate the beet salad, shishitro peppers, diver scallops, and the miso-butterscotch budino. Everything was delicious!! The atmosphere was great, and I would highly recommend trying the bar area unless you want to make reservations 3-4 months out!!!"
"ZZZZZZ... huh? what?Oh yea, I went to the Goat yesterday. A $65 /person snooze fest. And so loud, why bother to have shared plates? You can''t hear the other people at the table say ""this is good, have some."" I guess I am not the targeted diner. The food at Publican is so much better and the selection of ""shared plates"" is better at Meson Sabika.Some good things though: I was using a Â cane and the staff was great about clearing a path to the bathroom for me. All the staff, not just one person. Â Nice touch and good training.The goat empanadas and pork cheek were really good. Everything else- just ok. Just ok enough that I just can't work up enough passion to even mention what else I had.The indifferent:If you are a fan of sour beers, don;t order the ""Monk's cafe Flemish sour"", It's not sour. MIxed drinks were said to be ""killer"" by Chicago Mag. I had the one with vodka, Pimm's, lime and cucumber. Its was ...ok. Â This morning, I can't actually tell you what it tasted like so quickly It faded from memory.We waited 6 months for a table- for 3 hours of averageness."
"My friend had to make reservations almost 3 months in advance but it was well worth the wait! They were very accommodation to our party (which came in a different times due to traffic) and out waiter was funny and very knowledgable about the menu. His recommendations were spot on. I suggest you order ALL of the breads, they were the best! I had no complaints on anything. Go with a group so you can try everything on the menu. I believe the menu changes often so there will always be something new."
"Should I start with the cow face or the goat neck we had? Maybe I'll start with the Bloody Mary bread or the shiitake chocolate ice cream and home made Oreo crumbles we ended the meal with. No, let me start with the extensive beer menu and attentive but not intrusive service. Forget it, Â I have a food coma and I'm going to bed. :-)"
"Midwesterners are SO MUCH NICER than Californians...at least to solo diners at one of the hottest restaurants in the city.After being told the bar was my best bet in snagging a seat on a busy Thursday night and advised on which bar diners were almost finished with their meals, I waited diligently behind a couple who were paying their bill. As soon as they stood up to leave, the hostess flew to my side, thrusted a newly-vacated chair toward me and told me to sit down quickly before other waiting patrons tried to steal it away. I was quite touched by the gesture, which I've never experienced in California. This alone warrants a five-star rating.The food definitely matched the tone of the excellent service. I sampled several small dishes and everything was superb, with the goat belly as the obvious standout. This is seriously not to be missed! Must I also mention that the specialty cocktails were extremely addictive, thanks to the bartender who kept me liquored up and hydrated all night. Drunk and alone....nice!To sum up my experience in a few words: dine unaccompanied like a stupid loser, receive special treatment. Try it sometime."
"We have been here a few times and it has been hit or miss ... Â Drinks are good, service top notch"
"Had the Pan Fried Shisito Peppers (Parmesan, sesame, miso), Hiramasa Crudo (crisp pork belly, chili aioli and caperberries), Â diver scallops (fois gras vinaigrette, king plums, sweet onions, brioche couton), kalbi ribs and finished off with the goat belly. All of it was amazing - I did try their BBQ octopus which I actually disliked but it didn't take away from the amazingness of everything else. The peppers had a nice spice at the end of it while the crisp pork belly had a nice saltiness offset by the caperberries. Usually I'm not much for scallops, but theirs were perfectly seared.I will be back to eat at the Girl & the Goat and I highly recommend you do the same."
"Wow, Yelp certainly did not disappoint! Of course, I was unable to get a reservation here during my weekend trip to Chicago so our party of 4 arrived at 4:30PM on Saturday and got seated right away! Almost everything we ordered was to die for, namely the scallops, fresh bread (they usually have 3+ different types with a pairing of sauces), and the pork. Although I love my veggies, all the vegetarian dishes were my least favorite out of the bunch. Plating and attention to detail (not to mention their cute goat mascot) really set this establishment apart from the rest in this city of tapas. Interior is rustic but comfortable and our server was phenomenal. MUST try, definitely one of the highlights of our trip!!!"
"We waited over 2hrs for a table, but the greeters and servers we very nice. The menu was somewhat limited, so if you don't eat seafood, this may not be the best choice for you. The portion sizes are rather small and the food was not good enough for the price."
"the only thing i can say about this place is AMAZING food! get ready for an adventurous experience. Reservations are full almost everyday, but if you show up after 9-9.30pm, you may have a chance to have a table."
"Amaaaazzingg!! I enjoyed every bite at the Girl & The Goat. One complaint that I have is that the food was overly salty and sometimes made my tongue curl! See the comments below. I'm not one to shy away from quizzical looking food or from interesting dishes. Made an appointment for 3 at 7pm and got seated right away. Mind you, this reservation was made about a month prior to the date.Dishes that we tried:-Sauteed Green Beans (YUM, some of us want the recipe!)-Lamb Stuffed Calamari (Good but geez those vegetables on the side were WAY too salty, downed a few full glasses of water afterwards...I've never tasted anything so salty at a restaurant before =[)-Pinn Oaks Lamb Tartare (oh my gosh, SO good)-Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (not a pig face! but slightly tasted similar to Spam...I wonder if they incorporate it or mimic the taste?)-Crisp Braised Pork Shank (yum again, wish this came out first)-Busta Rye Bread with smoked salmon cream but I also asked for the goat cheese butter on the side because I love goat cheese! Both were great. We used them quite often with other dishes as well (hint: both spreads goes great with lamb tartare)-Goat Empanadas (One of our favs!!! Fresh veggies and grilled blueberries. amazing but I wish they gave you more than just 2 empanadas! At least 3-4 would have been great)-Dessert: Plaintain Cake (not too sweet! we like that =))Service was also great. They were on point and really catered to our every need especially refilling the water. We drank so much water because I think the salt content is pretty high in this restaurant but it's ok, we enjoyed the food :)."
"Absolutely amazing. Everything was great. I usually say, ""Why eat the food my food eats?"" But even the cauliflower was better than most burgers (never thought this possible). And that being the case, you can imagine how great the meat tastes. Must try."
"Many reviews for this place so what should stand out??I came here last night for a special occasion and LOVED IT! Â I made reservations well in advance and arrived early. Â The staff was awesome to us and seated us right at 4:30pm. Â We caught a glimpse of Stephanie but didn't get a chance to chat with her of snap a pic with her considering we are huge Top Chef fans.The only complaint I had was the table we sat at was a little wobbly and our drinks were spilling. Â The floor was a rustic wooden plank that of course has it's inherent unevenness - no problem as the waitress and a busboy adjusted it quickly.The waitress went over the menu with us and gave us some pointers on how much to order and what we'd like. Â  LOVED EVERY CHOICEWe ordered the following:Pretzel appetizer - awesomeness with French dressing and flavored butterWood fired wiley point - Horseradish, bacon and oysters?? Â Yes pleaseHiramasa crudo - pork belly enough saidDiver scallops - perfectly cooked and HUGEWagyu tartare - my favorite with great flavors mixed togetherBroken arrow ranch quail - red pepperocinis and grapes SUPERBSmoked goat rillette empanadas - absolutely awesome - must get itemThe place was packed, the atmosphere was awesome, the food was impeccable, and the staff was great. Â We'll be coming back soon to get the highly acclaimed pig face!!"
Really great service...even we sat at the bar since there was a long wait for proper seating got enough privacy..green beans and salmon were great....goat shank could have been done better...overall a must go place :-)
"Finally. Almost three years after it opened, we got in here for dinner. (Truth be told I had always been a little weirded out by the name -- lingering shadow of the Edward Albee play about the man who fell in love with a goat). On a wet Friday night, 4 of us scored a cozy table in the front corner. It allowed for some great conversations without shouting. (The restaurant is really loud). We got our one-page, three-column menu divided by Vegetable, Fish or Meat. After being advised by our friendly waiter to choose about 3 dishes to share within each column, we set down to business. The kono kampache crudo, a white fish with pork belly and caperberries melted in our mouths; the goat liver mousse served with warm tender biscuits had us wanting to lick the knife clean, and the kohirabi salad with fennel and this vibrant ginger dressing were standouts for all of us. Just writing this review two days later brings it all back to me. I realize this restaurant has the potential to be over hyped. But I have to say, the wonderfully prepared food, the attentive wait staff and the general vibe of the restaurant was wonderful. I'd be here every month if I could."
"This place is awesome. The food is good and often adventurous. However the hype isn't really worth the price. If prices were lower I'd give this place a full 5 stars. It would also be nice if Â more of the tables weren't grouped together. I get that thats part of the experience but there are tables that are individuals so I don't get why it's like that at all. But those two nit picks aside service is great, food is tasty, the drink menu is lacking but if you want a variety of drinks go to Haymaker in the same area. Come here for the food and one of a kind experience."
"You don't need to read a review. Â Just go. Â It's better than what they say. Â Don't worry about a reservation either, show up and wait the 40 mins or eat at the bar. Â JUST GO!"
i have tried many amazing restaurants and this restaurant by far blew my taste buds away. every dish has the most unique and amazing flavors i have ever had! i normal dont eat pork but had to try the pig face and it was unbelievable also the chick pea appetizer was unbelievable! def one of the top rest i have been too highly recommended!!
"If you can, just get of work early on a weekday, get there around 5PM and sit at the bar - otherwise you'll need reservations months in advance. However, Stephanie's food is worth the trouble to get in. Seriously.There's a menu of ""belly's"" (pork, goat) prepared several ways, amazing entrees. (vegetarians will find good food here, but the place is definitely geared toward carnivores).My tip would be to get dinner/drinks at Girl and the Goat and then head to Little Goat diner down the street for desert and a change of scenery (also, if you go to Little Goat, get the CheeseIt and Nestle Quick ice cream sundae. Just do it, you'll not be sorry)"
"Not hungry? This place will change your mind....Walking in, the brooding atmosphere and moody decor were indicative of the meal: powerful, flavorful and a little heavy. We ate the menu as it was designed, a couple small plates per person, to share. The choices were enough to lure you in. Goat, pork shank, tongue, sugo, short rib...all intoxicating to my ear. I wanted to order them all, but fortunately for me, my partner had a bit more wherewithal. We ordered 4. In order of personal enjoyment: the baby octopus was tender and fresh with lots of other nummies along with (mushrooms, pistachios, guanciale)...too many nummies? There could have been more octopi. But delicious! Next, the goat empanadas. contrary to popular opinion, the crust on an empanada is really the key to its success and this one was perfection, crisp but flaky...and not just a pie crust repurposed. There was killer green ""stuff"", lovely veg and queso fresco along with...all delicious...the goat, on the other hand, was a little lost. When I go to a place with GOAT in the name, I want some goaty goat! Still, worth the order! Then...came the ""pig face"". Like....a pig's face y'all! Pulled off of a little piggy skull and fried, then served over fried potatoes with a fried egg on top, then the whole plate is fried in friedness. It tasted like ""fried"" too. Lastly, we got some monkfish. It was fried too...but less so. It was really nom.....but a little forgettable. When its all said and done, the waiter was the most succulent part of this meal....but everything was worth the wait, worth the hype and I would do it again...there's a WHOLE lot of deliciousness to sample here!"
"This place if great. Period.The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars as oppose to 5 is all the hype that I heard. I came in here with high expectations given the rave reviews through word of mouth and from reviews. More over, I had to book my reservation 4 months in advance through opentable to get a decent time slot. That exclusivity had my expectations at an all time high.I must admit that I really enjoyed the food and the ambiance. If you're even in town, I would definitely try this place. Its great food, good ambiance and very affordable.Just be aware that you need to plan way in advance unless you dont mind eating at 3pm or 11pm at night."
Most amazing food. Every bite was like a taste of heaven. The bartenders were also equally amazing. I will fly all the way back to Chicago from San Francisco just to eat here again and we have some great restaurants in SF.
"Get the pig face! It is delicious and well worth the pain of trying to get a reservation. I have been here 3 times and all times have been great. The service is friendly, the food is AMAZING. I can't stress enough how delectable the pig face is and the miso butterscotch dessert is something I dream about :-)"
"Stephanie's concept is amazing. Â Such a great restaurant. The servers are knowledgable and nice. The support staff is amazing, the gave us details on everything that came out. Of course the kitchen staff is huge and care so much about the food the put out. We had a ton of food and was a lot less then we expected to pay. It's a great experience. Make a reservation or try to catch a seat in the lounge or bar. You won't be disappointed."
"We got a last minute reservation for 10:30 pm for my friend's birthday (10:30 was a bit late, but we were excited). We started with drinks, which were all tasty. My drink was recommended by the waitress and it was mighty tasty. For food we shared: -Fried Pickles - I don't usually like fried pickles, but this dish was really tasty...the lighter colored sauce was fantastic, the miso based sauce was not so awesome. -Falafel- good falafel, really tasty peanut sauce, but not a must order. -Pig face- oh yes, pic face! It was awesome! Like bacon and eggs with hashbrowns...it was awesome!-Broccoli- it was ok, but blue cheese isn't my thing-Goat empanada- this was BY FAR the best item....the goat was tender and flavorful and the sauce was wonderful, I could have licked the plate. -PB and J dessert- decent, but nothing I'd run out to get-Chocolate dessert with weird ice cream- not a fan...that ice cream was pretty not awesome.-Miso butterscoth budino- this dessert was by far the best dessert, it tasted so wonderful....I loved every bite. Overall, I liked this place, but it just wasn't as delicious as it was expensive and hyped up. I'd go back here if other people wanted to, but it isn't a must visit location."
"Great group dining!Have tried several times to snag a table at Goat before. Â It is definitely worth the trouble, but make sure you make reservations. Â We found late night dining on Sunday to be less crowded, but still busy and energetic. We opted for small plate ""shares"" and loved everything we had. Â Save room for dessert. Â Portions were small, but allowed us to try more options. Â Our server planned the order in which we received the plates to optimize the experience. Â Definitely a foodie's venue -- be open-minded as the mix of tastes and textures can be unusual and surprising. Â Take a bigger group so you can try everything on the menu!"
"Superb food! I ordered seared ahi tuna, wood oven grilled pig face n amazing dessert w bacon toffee candied cashews. Gonna try the little goat diner soon !"
There is nothing else I can write that hasn't been said in a 5-star rating before!Phenomenal.Delicious.Unique.Divine.Fresh. I have been to Girl & the Goat about 4 times now and it never gets old...and well worth the 2-3 month wait for reservations.
"Definitely should have stayed with the waitress' recommendations which were our favorites: steak tartare, halibut and green beans for example. When we opted to venture off those the items were not as good such as escargot raviolis. We ended up staying in relaxing, social area for our entire dinner experience the service was fantastic with the team approach. Drinks were Â great and they had a nice selection. We were too full to enjoy their dessert menu. We would definitely go back!"
"Pig face.Every trip requires at least one helping of pig face. If you're my friend, Clayton T., then you need two per meal.I've been here four times now and the pig face is the single best dish I've had in Chicago. Sure there are plenty of other dishes that are great (the shishito peppers, cauliflower, and cod cheeks come to mind), but this review will center around the revelation that is ""pig face."" First or all, what comes in the pig face? Well, you start with a symphony of fatty pig parts found on the pig's face (snout, tongue, cheek, etc.) and you use it to sandwich some crunchy twiggy potatoes. What do you serve under this facial sandwich? A trio of sauces (a tamarind and black garlic sauce, a cilantro oil, and a red wine-maple gastrique). To top off this gluttonous assortment is a runny-ass sunny-side up egg. If you're a pork lover, this will fill that void that can't be filled by even the bacon-iest of bacon. It's that porky. It's perfection.It's also relatively affordable. At only $16, you can order yourself a plate (forget sharing). Do this. Do this every time.This is really all I have to say about Girl & The Goat. The pig face speaks for itself. What about the ambiance and decor and whatnot? Doesn't matter. Your focus will all be on the pig face.TL;DR - Pig face."
love love love.
"The food was just okay, we made our reservation a month in advanced because it is so hard to get in and I definitely don't think it lived up to the hype. Â We had a group of 4 and ordered several items to share but we all left hungry and went elsewhere for dessert."
"My wife and I happened to be staying at the Waldorf last Saturday night and the fantastic concierge got us a last minute reservation. Â We had to be there early, but were okay with that since this place usually runs 3 months for a reservation. Â We arrived at 5pm and checked in with the hostess who told us that we were about to have the best seats in the house. Â She started walking us towards the kitchen/food window and then we realized we were about to sit at the only two seats that were attached to the actual service window.The appetizer chef which stood a mere two feet away from us chatted us up through dinner. Â He answered all of our questions and told us what we were eating. Â They also sent us three free plates. Â The food along with the ""show"" made for the best dinner we've had in a long time...or maybe ever.Okay, so for the food. Â The pigface was insanely good! Â I usually don't eat anything out of the ordinary and asked that I wasn't told what was in each dish. Â I just ate! Â Shortribs were amazing, the mushroom ravioli was fantastic. Â If you can't tell, I HIGHLY recommend this place! Â Great food, Steph (as the cooks call her)!"
"Great service! Â Definitely overhyped, but then again, what can a Top Chef winner really wow with? Â Some items were fantastic (grilled beet salad, green beans, pork shank, duck breast, and beef tongue.)The desserts are AMAZING!!!Try for yourself for an experience and bragging rights to your co-workers. But do not hype yourself up as you may not be super impressed."
Hands down my favorite place I went to while visiting Chicago. I was able to get in without a reservation which are booked out 3 months. I sat at the bar I really enjoyed it. I tried so many dishes here and the bartender was nice a able to order half plates for me since I was not sharing with anyone. The cauliflower was so good. Roasted to perfection with a hint of caramelization. The mint was a nice touch and the pine nuts gave texture. My next dish was the scallop with kimchi. Another winning dish. The scallops were cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. I also had the fried oysters which were delicious. Nice and tender and not over fried. Served on spoons and had a little egg salad and caper on top. I can not remember the other two savory dishes I had. One was cheeks and the other was like a steak. Both dishes were really good. Â I also tried the desserts which were again delicious. Will definitely visit this place again if I go back to Chicago.
"The perfect date or special occasion restaurant, (if you can score the table) Girl & the Goat has not disappointed on any of my visits. They folks here obsess over the food- some of the dishes I've had here are ones I remember happily on days when I eat nothing but say, a boring salad or a PBJ. The kimchi scallop dish, as well as the parmesan with shishito peppers particularly sticks out.Service is solid, booze is a little overpriced, but it's Randolph street and they making a killing on it anyway. This place is worth it."
delicious and creative menu
"I have not one bad thing to say about my visit here a few months ago. Yes, I was graced with the opportunity to sit at the Chef's counter, so my boyfriend and I were able to see the chefs making and prepping the food that was being sent out to the dining room. The food.... was amazing, to be honest the dishes that stuck out to me the most were the pig face, the sauteed green beans and the butterscotch dessert. Everything from the service to the food was amazing, the ambiance was perfect, and they catered to our schedule because that night we were going to the hawks game too. Don't forget to try the pig face and sauteed green beans though, seriously those are my top two! So good, can't wait to go back."
"There's nothing I can really say that others haven't. Don't miss:- The breads: Our waitress discouraged us from ordering more than one, but this carb-loving girl ignored that warning and tried 2 varieties anyways. Amazing!- The goat: This one's obvious.- The dessert: I'm usually a chocolate girl, so nothing stood out to me. Luckily my friends both ordered dessert (the plantain cake and the butterscotch pudding) and they were both unbelievable. My biggest tip is DON'T WAIT TO COME HERE! As a lifelong Chicagoan, my attitude has always been that if a place is so cool that it's booked months in advance, I can just wait it out and go once the hype dies down. We got lucky with a walk-in on a Thursday night, and I am bummed that I waited so long. I was already trying to figure out when I could come back before we even got the check."
"Went last night with my son for the first time. Â Walked in right on opening time and were seated immediately after being advised that the table was reserved for later in the evening. Â Thought this was a very responsible and thoughtful way to run a restaurant. Â Anyway, had Calvin as a waiter, and what good service he provided! Â We ordered the pierogi, calamari, cauliflower, duck breast and goat neck. Â Also had a bread selection and beer(s). Â Calvin was instrumental in helping us make our selections and he did a kick-butt job. Â Oh! Â Had the citrus pavlova for dessert, too! Â :) Â Fantastic food. Â Fantastic space. Â Fantastic service. Â Wish I could be there right now."
"The only thing bad about Girl and the Goat is that it's hard to get a reservation here. That said, even without a reservation you can walk in and sometimes get very lucky. We once walked in on a weekend night and even though the place was packed, we were immediately seated near the bar and served promptly. The food is excellent, whether you're an adventurous meat eater or more conservative or vegetarian. The menu is seasonal so it changes regularly and I have yet to be disappointed. I highly recommend coming here with 2-4 people so you can share and taste as much as possible. Some reviewers say this place is pricey, but it's a real bargain for the the high quality of food and innovative cuisine."
"Service was the best I think I have ever received! Â Our water glasses were always full, clean plates were always in front of us for the next dish, and we never felt interrupted. Â The waitress answered any questions, was extremely nice, and had great recommendations for us. Â Everything we ordered was amazing! Â My favorite was the duck breast. Â Soo soft and flavorful. Even though the place was crowded, it was still very, very cozy. Â Just go here."
It's the best restaurant in Chicago. Everything is amazing. I've been three times and can't wait to go back a fourth.
Overhyped and overpriced. The flavor profiles just did not go together. Â Don't waste your time or money and go to the Purple Pig instead.
"If the first 1600+ reviews didn't sway your opinion then mine certainly will (yeah, sure). Â Three of us showed up without a reservation at 4:30 on a Friday night and were shown to a table. Â They told us that the table was needed for a reservation at 6:15 but it was all ours till then. Â The server was very....um...enthusiastic? Â Helpful, friendly, interested, quick, all good things you look for in a server. Â We each ordered a drink from the specialty cocktail menu. Â I chose the Double Standard and it was good. Â When it was time to order a second drink the server offered some unsolicited (yet welcome) suggestions and I ended up trying a Kentucky Mule, which so tasty I had two. Â We ordered 2 dishes each for all of us to share. Â I don't remember any of them being disappointing in the least. Â We had the escargot ravioli, wood grilled broccoli, kalbi ribs, roasted pig face, smoked goat empanadas, and some kind of oysters (can you guess which ones I ordered?). Â I don't remember what was atop the oysters, but I do recall the server saying ""and here are the blah blah oysters. Â Topped with blah blah, blah, cilantro, blah, and love"". Â Which prompted me to say ""oh, I'm allergic to love"" (I crack myself up). Â My favorites were the escargot ravioli, kalbi ribs, and the pig face. Â The peaches and corn dessert was delicious. Â I wanted to whisper sweet nothings to it and make sure it knows how much it means to me. Â We also had some kind of cheese cake that was good, but not my favorite. Â The decor of the dining room is dark, warm, and inviting. Â There is seating at a raised bar facing the kitchen where you can watch the magic happen. Â We were seated at a corner booth table that was cozy but comfortable. Everything was great, the food, the service, the decor, the company. Â There were plenty of items on the menu that I could've snarfed and probably loved, I'm sure at some point I'll be back. Â Honestly, I'll probably just be back for that peaches and corn dessert."
"I loved every little thing about my dinner here from the drinks to the dessert. It really is that good. Don't miss the goat liver mousse. It sounds strange, but it's the most unique, delectable thing I've eaten in recent memory."
"My boyfriend and I went here to celebrate our anniversary and we were not disappointed! We did not make reservations and decided to go there right when it opened. We were really lucky and got a seat at the bar area.First off the service was phenomenal! The bar tenders were super nice and very knowledgeable about the menu and answered every question that we had. Also we didn't feel rushed sitting at the bar and the dishes were evenly spaced for us to enjoy each one. Also the cocktails were amazing!Here is what we ordered:Corn fed bread: Definitely enjoyed the goat cheese butter. Good to try but wished I skipped it to order another delicious dishEscargot ravioli: Served in a a tamarind miso sauce. Very light and I liked the play of the pasta in miso.Duck tongues: the bartender recommended it and we were not disappointed! There were so many complex flavors with this dish. The duck tongues were fried to a nice crispy texture and pairing it with the tuna poke and crunchy vegetables created great texture. Definitely my favorite dish of the nightConfit goat belly: Another delicious dish! It had a consistency like brisket and I really enjoyed the lumps of lobster and crab that came with it. The shaved fennel added some texture to the goat bellyWe were quite full after that but we got dessert on the house.Miso butterscotch budino: amazing!!!!!! the combination of the the glazed pineapple, bacon toffee, candied cashews and butterscotch pudding with a little bit of sponge cake was something that I never tasted before. If you get this dessert you need to eat all of the components at once and experience a sweet and salty complex flavor.Many thanks for the delicious dessert.Overall definitely worth the hype!"
"One of the best meals of my life. Try the octopus salad and the goat belly with lobster and crab. Unreal. Also, don't be discouraged by the long wait time if you have a party of two. Just show up -- you might get a table if you have the right attitude!"
"This was amazing, all the food was great. The service was attentive. The tables are a little close together but you get to know your neighbors and they suggest what to order. Go with the pig face it was awesome! This is what we had, all was amazingly delicious:-goat liver mousse-pig face-goat empanadas-sweet corn goat cheese wontons-kona kampachi crudo-wood fire permaquid oysters-raw goat cheeseThe best was the PBJ dessert ice cream, gelato, and donuts. I think this was my favorite part next to the goat liver mousse which was delicate, smooth, and perfect. I can't wait for my next bday dinner here! Just make a reservation 3 months ahead to get the time and day you want."
"i neeeed to come back and get me some more of those chickpea fritters! they sounded so weird, but based on the yelp reviews i had to give them a try and i almost wish i got 2 orders! they were the first dish we had at g&g and by far the best. maybe my taste buds were being weird that day bc i was just getting over the flu, but everything else kinda went downhill, to the point where i didn't even want to order dessert there. we also got escargot ravioli (flavors were too delicate), confit goat belly (tender but on the salty side), and pig face (superrrr fatty and salty). i must say that the dishes at g&g are super unique but are more so of an acquired taste. note: my hubs absolutely loved everything (except the overly fattiness of the pig face) and thought this was a solid 5 star! soo maybe i am just a weirdo. but either way, i would definitely come back for the chickpea fritters and try out some other dishes! although pricey, small plates are the best!"
"I was a bit disappointed. We booked months in advance, anticipating a culinary experience. When we arrived I was surprised to see that the place is huge, insanely loud, dark and jammed with people. It seemed more like a night club than a restaurant. It was so loud that I could not carry on a conversation at our table. The noise is so overwhelming that the parties around us were literally screaming at each other. The food we had was good, not great. Most dishes are braised. They lack delicacy because they are cooked for so long. Perhaps it was just a coincidence that all the meats we ordered were slow cooked. Unlike most restaurants of top chefs, Girl and a Goat is a family style, or shared plates format which was disappointing in that there was no construction of the meal. I would have been interested to have an ordered sequence of dishes, but things were brought to the table in a random order. Some dishes were huge, one ( the scallops ) was too small to share with our party of four. None of the plates were bad or poorly executed. Each were interesting and impressive in themselves, it was just not the culinary experience I was hoping for. It just seems like this place is a missed opportunity. If the music was not blaring, if the menu was sequenced, if not all the meat was braised...."
"I give this restaurant six stars! All of the food we ordered here is just amazing and very original.We got the pig face based on other yelp reviews and not disappointed at all!The restaurant had a great energy, and the service was very friendly and helpful. We asked our waiter for suggestions and they were all spot on!I also love that this place is open late.I'm looking forward to coming back here on my next trip to Chicago!"
short ribs!!!!!
The ambience and the food were great. I liked the veggies and I was told the goat was locally sourced. The goat options turned out to be quite appetizing. Def recommend and would go back!
"The food is wonderful, family style small plates that, one after another amazed and impressed us. Our waitress, despite being extremely busy - as there was a lot of activity in the restaurant was friendly, attentive and helpful. The only reason I don't give it 5 stars is because of the noise. And admittedly there really isn't much the owners can do about it because they have created a very successful and popular spot. But it is a very open space with high ceilings, combined with the constant activity at the entrance and the bar make for a very uncomfortable volume level."
"We stumbled on this place on the internet while making plans to come to Chicago. Â We gathered, correctly it seems, that the place was popular so made a reservation weeks out. Â A good thing too as the place was totally packed at 10 pm on the Tuesday evening we showed up for dinner. Â We were seated promptly. Â What followed was magic. Â For dinner, we had the fried pickles, pig face, goat belly and goat empanadas. Â The goat empanadas were the best single item we ate during our trip to Chicago. Â And, given the fare available in Chicago, that is saying something. Â For dessert we shared the Butterscotch Miso Budino. Â We didn't think it looked too inspiring, but once we got it on our tongues, we were filled with love. Â Now, certain restaurants, in an attempt to be high end, will mix disparate elements together in the hopes of being chic, only to have the resulting dish range from forgettable to gross. Â This was not that. Â The flavors played perfectly together and this sweet treat was a pleasure.Based on my experience, I would say the chef's strength is achieving balance in the dishes -- delicious, delicious balance.Seating was close together, but we got over that quickly due to the delicious. Â Our server, whose name I have unfortunately forgotten, was excellent. Â Friendly in a down to earth way and attentive but not overbearing. Â He took great care of us and helped to add to a wonderful experience. Â We will definitely be back the next time we hit Chicago."
"This place is poppin'. I guess owner/chef/Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard Â is doing pretty well for herself. Better put in your reservations in now, especially since we saw cameras lurking around her restaurant to film for the next season of Bourdain's Layover show on Discovery channel. With all the press around this place, does it really stand up to the hype? Sadly no, mainly due to a lack of seasoning.Kohlrabi salad - refreshing albeit a bit on the warm side, nice, under seasonedRoasted cauliflower - decent would have been good but again it was under seasoned (where's the salt?)Grilled baby octopus, guanciale . romano beans . radish . pistachio-lemon vinaigrette - tender nice, but i have had better.Crudo - a little too light on flavor, forgettablePig face - didn't have it, but i heard it was above averageGoat empanadas - didn't have it, but Â my friends deemed it good but unexceptional.Goat cheese ice cream - WOW, this was good. Goat cheese was prominent but not in your face. perfect amount of sweetness.For a place that packed and busy, service was exceptional--They're on top of it.Overall, the experience was just okay."
"What's there to say about this place that 10,000 other people haven't said? Â The best dining experience in Chicago - better than Alinea, and you won't have to mortgage your first-born. Â It's so satisfying to eat at a restaurant that completely lives up to the hype.We were seated right next to the grill, close enough that I made accidental awkward eye contact with the grillmaster a half dozen times before we introduced ourselves properly. Â The kitchen staff would have put a German U-boat crew to shame - everyone was masterfully efficient, completely in control of their station, from the cauliflower guy (yes, a guy who cooked cauliflower all goddamn night) to the dishwasher. Â We ordered the whitefish, goat belly, pig face (fuck you pig), and beef tongue. Â Because we were sitting at the pretty little princess table, they also gave us complimentary oysters, cauliflower, and dessert. Â Everything was rich, balanced, and filling. Â Simply perfect.Service was impeccable. Â My water glass was never empty for more than a couple seconds. Â Plates were whisked away like they had done something wrong. Â Sack up. Â Cruise OpenTable like you're drunk and it's OKCupid. Â It's worth it."
Well worth it.
"Sigh....starstruck because Stephanie Izard was in the house! Â And I loved watching her almost beat Iron Chef Simon on the FoodNetwork. Â And because she's so awesome, volunteering w/kids to teach them about nutrition at WholeFoods and how to cook at the Chopping Block. Â And she's actually in her restaurant calling out orders and making it all happen.More importantly - I got to sit at the Chef's Table with my boyfriend! Â Fantastic. Â How did they know? Â The universe conspired, I think. Â But I simply made my reservation on OpenTable for a Wed night at 5:30 pm for two people and we were whisked to those seats upon arrival. Â We were dressed up to head out for a show afterwards so maybe that helped. Â I don't know but I gotta say it made my night.There are a few perks of sitting at the Chef's Table. Â Some of which include, leaving stuffed beyond belief and smiling ear to ear.Thank you to a wonderful first experience at GTG. Â I don't know that it can be topped but we shall see."
"Food is phenomenal and price is reasonable (before liquor) for the quality of the meal. Â Getting a reservation can be frustrating, but for those in the area, you can usually sneak into the bar or lounge area, which is full-service food and drinks, between 5-6. The food (out of 5)(4) Goat empanadas - Great to start with. Â Crisp on the empanada, tender goat inside, rich feta on the outside, and nice acidity from the pickled beets. Â Perfect combination of flavors and texture.(4) Broccoli - This was an interesting dish. Â If you like smokey, order this, as it is INTENSELY smokey. Â If you do not like smokey, do not order this, as it is INTENSELY smokey. Â I'm talking smokier than a 18 hour brisket, and so heavy that it overpowers the blue cheese accompaniment. But I like smokey, hence the 4/5.(5) Halibut - For those who don't know, Stephanie was owner and chef of Scylla in bucktown, which was a seafood focused restaurant, so she knows her seafood. The halibut was delicious, nice char, soft and flaky meat that went well with the other flavors of the dish (I forget what they were).(2) Pig face - I wanted to like this, but just didn't deliver like the other items. Â Pig face is extremely crispy, but the texture really dies after the initial bite. Â (3) Goat ribs - The ribs were good, tender off the bone, but I really couldn't discern much from the taste between goat and your basic pig or cow ribs. Â (3) Plantain Cake - Sort of a deconstructed cake with crispy chocolate-like flakes, 2 types of gelato, and a stout-based sauce. Â It sounded amazing, but the actual dessert was just ok. Â Stout-sauce wasn't noticeable, cake wasn't anything out of the ordinary. Â I thought the dish paired much better with the passionfruit gelato than the cream-cheese/chocolate one, the latter was a bit to tangy for my taste, but the passionfruit was vibrant and brought the cake to life.They serve up legit, stiff cocktails, so don't gawk at the price. Â I had one old-fashioned and it was as potent as 3-4 drinks at a normal bar. Â Had some wine to finish off.The damage isn't bad, I probably spent more on the liquor than food. Â Well worth the price."
"Got a 10:45pm reservation at this place and it was worth the wait! Â I usually never eat this late but I made an exception and am so thankful I did. Â Had the cauliflower salad (served warm) to start and although it may not look or smell very good, it sooo is!! Â The mix of veggies and herbs were fantastic.Another favorite was the pig face. Â Now although the name of the dish may sound weird, it's totally worth every bite. Â Don't worry, you don't actually see a face and if the face was actually present, it would be covered with an egg. Â Fried egg makes everything taste better!The hamachi was just ok. Â Probably wouldn't get that again. Â But everything else was superb, including the service, and I'd recommend this place to any local or visitor. Â Enjoy!"
"Incredible food, great ambiance, pig face to die for, but if you want a once in a lifetime memory, sit at the bar Â in Justin's section amd follow his drink and food recomendations . . . Then thank me later."
This was my second time dining here- very creative tasty food. The bittersweet chocolate and miso butterscotch deserts were incredible!
"No one needs to read the zillionth review about this popular restaurant by Stephanie Izard.I'm writing a review more to chronicle my own gluttonous food journey through Chicago.I was lucky enough to come a few times in the past year... and left the restaurant amazed at the flavors that were bursting in my mouth every single time.My very favorite dish here is the chickpea fritters with eggplant. Yes, I have an uncommon and overzealous love for all things eggplant, but I am also very picky about how it is prepared. Most places like to bread it and fry it, which masks the delicate flavors. Stephanie doesn't take this easy way out... I don't know how she preps it, but it is a perfect foil for the crunchy and creamy fritters. Another fave is the green beans/string beans. She uses some very strong fish sauce in this dish, so sometimes it can be a bit salty. But... oh la la, i love the flavors. Be careful, because I think it is one of those dishes that can end up burning your mouth if you eat too much of it (like salt and vinegar chips).Yeah. I know. Neither of my favorite dishes is a meat or goat dish. Those are great too, but these were the two dishes that knocked my socks off. ps. The bread with the spreads ... so good. But I wouldn't order one unless I came with at least two other people. Not that the bread is large, but there's only so much room in your tummy."
"I was in town for a couple of days and really wanted to try this place before we went out for some more drinks. This place is definitely a bit on the higher end for the tapas but the quality of the food was amazing! I had the hamachi crudo, goat belly with crab and escargot ravioli. Really enjoyed all of them!"
"After having gone to Little Goat and making a reso 6 weeks in advance, I was stoked and ready. Â Couldn't wait to be a part of the in-crowd - those that have been to the magical Girl & The Goat. Â Sadly, I was a little disappointed. Â Granted, my friend and I didn't order too much - nor did we get too adventurous w/ our selections, but the simple dishes were still so simple. Â Hame frites. Â Light, thin, crispy, w/ bland aiolis. Â They were sufficient. Â Shrimp ceviche was so-so. Â I liked the sweetness and the chill flavor of it. Â But again, just too simple.The server brought us his favorite of the desserts. Â Toffee cake over glaze pineapple. Â Although we completely took it out between the two of us, again - something was just missing. Â Service was off. Â Things weren't coming out correctly. Â Taking things away when we weren't necessarily finished. Â Not awful - far from it... Â Just no personality - in the food, ambiance, service, anything."
"This place really is fabulous, but be prepared to spend a pretty penny. Also - my group overordered, even though we ordered less than our server told to. So I'd recommend ordering too few to start and you can always add on. My tables favorites were the roast goat, the miso hungry bread, and the mussels which came in a delicious sauce that I ended up putting on almost everything."
"My absolute favorite place to have visited in Chicago!I was worried that perhaps my expectations had been set too high for this place, but it surpassed even my highest expectations.The food was delicious. Â I especially loved the scallops, roasted beets, sugo, and pig face. I'm not at all a salad girl, but the roasted beets salad knocked my (and my boyfriend's) socks off! The only dish I would rather have not ordered was the goat belly. It was not ill-prepared, I simply did not care for the flavor they used. Still, our server Danielle was so friendly and nice. Â The restaurant itself has a terrific ambience. Do be cautioned though that it is not necessarily conducive to private conversation or a first date, as it is pretty loud. Â But it is a beautiful space.Hands down, my favorite place to eat in Chicago. Â It set the bar high for the rest of our trip!"
"It wasn't bad, but it wasn't good enough. Â Good thing I didn't read through all the Yelp reviews prior to the meal; otherwise, my expectations would have gone through the roof! Â After waiting several months for a reservation (dinner at 4:45pm, no less), and after having shelled out $50pp on dinner, I would have really liked to be blown away by the exquisite combination of culinary flavors and textures. Â Alas, I was left disappointed.G&TG serves small plates; it's recommended to order 2-3 per person. Â We tried a bread (the spence wheat, which came with peanut butter butter and honeycomb - yum!) and 8 dishes. Â The chickpea fritters and kalbi beef short ribs with corn fell into category 1: ""mmm, this is tasty"". Â  The grilled octopus, pan roasted walu, escargot ravioli (seemed undercooked), pork ribs, pigface with sunny side up egg, and pork fat doughnuts fell into category 2: ""interesting plate, but the combination of flavors is okay..."". Â The pigface tasted a little vinegary, the escargot was a little chewy, and the walu and pork ribs were kind of just there.Service was good. Â The waiter was enthused and attentive; those bringing out the plates give you a detailed description of the dish, but it's hard to hear and/or they don't speak particularly loud and clear, so listen closely! P.S. Â The girl is the goat. Â Izard = goat in some other language, and the original ""Drunken Goat"" name was already taken by a cheesery or someplace or other in California, so after a cease and desist letter... G&TG it is!"
My favorite restaurant for the last 4 years. My husband and I always sit at the bar for my birthday. We love to commune with the other bar diners and chat with the bartenders. All of the servers are very knowledgeable about the food and the wine. My all time favorite dish is the grilled baby octopus. This is a casual spot without pretension. Feel free to wear jeans or get dressed up.
"My advice if you don't have a reservation: arrive around 5pm, order a few drinks from the bar (the cocktails are delicious), and casually stand behind a group of people who look like they may finish their meal soon. If you can, it helps to introduce yourself and make conversation. That way when they finally do finish their amazing dinner you can snag their seats in the bar area. Now order as many dishes as you can! Everything is perfectly done. I have a dairy allergy and was pleasantly surprised when my server switched my regular menu for a dairy free version. Everything I wanted to try could be done without dairy. I think my group of 4 had at least 8 different dishes. What shined brightest for me was the octopus! I'm hoping to be back with my family and a reservation soon."
"Best restaurant I've ever been to. Â And if you saw my gut, you would know I've been to quite a few.Thank God for reservations because it was pretty packed for a Sunday night. Â We arrived and were promptly seated shortly thereafter. Â Three of us picked 2 items each and we all shared. Favorite dish? Tough to choose, but if I had to, it would probably be the duck tongue.Oh, and I'm the 3000th review for this place. How cool is that?"
"Wow, I was so speechless after finishing my meal here. Well, not because of my food coma, but because my taste buds were going crazy!!! Stephanie Izard is such a genius! Best meal I've had in ages!!! I bow down to you, Girl & The Goat.We got:- Bread with smoked salmon spread: mmmm who doesn't love bread?! It made me wish I could bring home the leftover spread.- Kona kampachi crudo : Delicious with a concoction of different textures. It makes the dish fun and interesting. Also, pork belly makes everything better.- Roasted beets: This was okay. My friend and I ended up not finishing it. It was nice having natural, salty hints of the anchovy in the dish, though!- Grill seared ahi tuna: This was amazing also! Loved the Japanese-fusion flavors to this- Roasted goat: Probably my least favorite dish... tasted like steak to me, haha. Also probably because I was getting full at this point.- PIG FACE: the grand finale and my favorite!... even though I was stuffed, I scarfed that thing like a mad woman. So tender, flavorful and delicious. I couldn't stop talking about this with my friends- Shiitake mushroom ice cream with chocolate: so weird, but so good at the same time! It's something totally innovative and unexpected. My taste buds were so confused, yet I continued to keep eating it... Very umami-ish flavor. Trust me, you HAVE to try this.I actually came here when I wasn't hungry and everything tasted delicious... so imagine coming here when you're hungry. I bet everything would have tasted 10x more amazing. If I ever come back to Chicago, I'm definitely stopping by again! I swear, you can order anything because I loved every single dish."
"Yeah so I kind of love this place. Â A lot.Yes, it's hard to get a reservation but it's worth it. Â If you haven't been before, my recommendation is to go in a group of at least 6 people. Â Then try 1 or 2 plates per person, since they are small plates. Â And all the desserts. Â We love the chickpea fritters - those and the kohlrabi salad are must-haves. Â Try one of the special breads and then ask and see what your server recommends. Â We have not been led astray by this in all the times I have been to Girl & the Goat. Â The specials are usually worth it, too. Â It's worth noting that the menu changes a bit now and again but what is on the website is a fair representation.If you've been before, I will still argue that 6 is the ideal number of people. Â Order the goat leg in advance and then get a side per person. Â It's the right amount of food. Â And, again, all the desserts. Â  We've done the goat leg and sides twice now and I am not sure I will go back to just small plates - the goat leg is smoked and braised and I don't know what else they do to it but it is truly fantastic. Â I was no a fan before I had the goat leg here and now it's something I actually crave. Â I like how it comes with a basket of naan-type bread, sliced hard boiled egg and 5 different sauces so that you can make your own sort of goat tacos with it. Â Great for groups.Cocktails and wine and beer selections are good and their servers are pretty knowledgeable about what pairs well with what. Â I like the cocktails in particular since they are not your ordinary rum-and-coke drinks.Friendly, timely service and it seems like the campfire fragrance that used to permeate the place has calmed down a lot. Â Plus, there is a cute, sparkly painting on the wall that I love.It's good stuff - worth the wait to get in every single time. Â Highly highly recommended."
"I know this is one of the trendiest places right now, but I was unimpressed with the meal. Ambiance and atmosphere were exceptional. But, the food was not to my taste (nor the person I was with). There are better places to spend an evening.. particularly if you're willing to wait 1-3 hours."
"People go ape shit over this place. That's cool and all, but it's like the celebrity gossip rag of Chicago restaurants. Only it does back it up with thorough travels through flavor country. But why does everyone need to post a review and picture? Seriously - over 2K pictures? Ridiculous."
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago!Try the pig face, scallops, pork shank, and green beans"
Packed to the gills! We had a reservation at 11pm on a saturday and people were still arriving for dinner at midnight! This place is so happening haha. the food was delicious and definitely a highlight of our chicago trip!
Happy to report this restaurant deserves the hype. Vegetables were a standout. The hamachi crudo was delicate but with a complexity I could not decipher. The baby octopus with roasted brussel sprouts was a bit of the sea combined with the caramelized spouts. The shank was fork tender with a kim chee version of buffalo wing sauce. I felt like drinking the sauce. We tried 16 dishes in our party of eight. Only one was not superb. Wait staff was perfect! A delight.
"Just enjoyed my 2nd visit to G&tG. It was even better than before! Hands down, one of my favorite meals.It started with us requesting the chef's table or expediting table- the 2 seats facing the line cooks. Showed up on time and they led us to the coveted seats. As a perk, we got complimentary lamb tartare and it was the star of the night. I love the veggies- cauliflower is melt in your mouth amazing. Excellent food and service."
"This is probably the best meal I have ever had in Chicago. We happened to get a 10 pm reservation on a Sunday the weekend I was visiting (side note: check reservations online for the same weekend and sometimes there's a cancellation) , and this place is definitely worth it! The two dishes that really stuck out were the roasted cauliflower, which was so simple but so good, and the pig face. Don't make the mistake of eating a small snack before if you have a late night reservation. You'll regret it. Already want to go back!"
"My night at girl and the goat started off very rocky but they made up for it in a big way. I had 9:45 pm reservations so I got there around 9:20. The hostess informed me that we would be sitting closer to our reservation time. I was fine with that. She told us they would find us at the bar. Luckily when we got to the bar two people were leaving so we were able to sit down. The bartender Justin was great, very funny guy with great suggestions. He kept us entertained for awhile. Normally I would've just ate at the bar but since it was my girlfriends birthday and we waited about 3 months for these reservations we wanted to sit down at a table. 10:10 rolls around and we were still sitting at the bar. I go talk to the hostess to find out they couldn't find my reservations right after I checked in and the girl told me to sit down. I was a bit frustrated to say the least. They sat us down right away, brought us out some amazing bread and complimentary jalapeÃ±os and Parmesan cheese appetizer that were so good. They apologized at least 3 or 5 times. They definitely made it up to us. I really appreciated that. The good was out of this world. Out server Gary was great he made some really good suggestions like the pork shank which is a must try. I really wanted the pork face and egg on top but they were sold out of it. Another slight damper in out plans but all in all the place is great. It's worth the wait and I think anyone who is a really foodie should try this place out. I'll definitely be back and I'm looking forward to trying little goat across the street. Their service is top notch. I recommend just eating and drinking at the bar with Justin, he'll definitely show you a great time, maybe even sing a song or two"
"Well, had to try it once for all the hype. Between me and two others we shared bread appetizer, pepper appetizer, fried pickles, pork belly, steak, and escargot ravioli and was still starved afterwards because the portions are so small, we each got about one or two bites each per plate. The best part was the steak which was cooked perfectly. However the escargot ravioli was tasty but a bit salty. The portions did not make much sense either. The pepper appetizer was rather large and we found ourselves only wanting to eat a few each since they were spicy and the entrees were much smaller. The fried pickles had nothing special to them, honestly I've had better at far cheaper BBQ joints. Everything tasted good, but nothing was certainly amazing."
"I wanted to be with the group that was wowed by this place but alas- I find myself belonging in the other camp, the one wondering what the hype was all about. Â So we arrived a ad early for our 10 pm reservation and were greeted promptly and cheerfully by the hostess. Â It took less than a minute for us to get seated and we were amazed by how packed the place was! The space itself was nothing impressive; big and spacious but I imagine it's not the decor that people wait months for. Â Our waitress was friendly but she was loopy- and took forever getting our first drink order and forgot about our second order completely. Â She came back after a while and asked, ""so, are you guys ready for a glass of wine?"" and I just smiled at my husband as we resisted every temptation to say: "" actually, we're ready for that drink we ordered 15 minutes ago! ""Now for the food, we had the crudo (fresh but not crazy about the sauce that reminded me too much of mayonnaise), the octopus, chickpea fritters, scallops, and the pig face. Â Each dish was done well but nothing about stood out as something unique or innovative. Â Our dessert of chocolate cake was also just ok. Â So good place to eat? -- absolutely! Worth waiting months for? --- for now, I'll just have to agree to disagree with the fans."
"loved girl & the goat! We made reservations 2 months in advance and i hear it's hard to get a reservation so the earlier you make a reservation, the better :). our friends came straight from the airport & were really accommodating and stored their luggage for them.things we ordered (we ordered 3 veges, 3 fish, 3 meats but my favs were the veges):- cauliflower 10/10: i loved the mix of flavors- beets 9/10- broccoli: 9/10- Sugo- Scallops- Escargot Ravioli: 6/10- Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face with a runny egg on top: 10/10- Kalbi Style Beef Ribs"
"Like the other 2,000 reviews....this place is legit! The menu is creative and the flavors are amazing. I had the pork shank (it was a bit salty by itself but worked when you ate it with the bread, deep fried duck tongue, oysters and shisito peppers and all were the bomb!"
"Amazing place!!!! Our favorite so far, we keep making reservations 3 months ahead and are always amazed with the talent of the chef. Â One small complaint is the drinks, they cost $13, which is normal for this kind of place, but you only get half of the glass, very disappointing to pay $13 for about 3 ounces of a cocktail. Favorite food items: pork shank and pig face."
"Yum. Recommend the smoked fries, chocolate malt and hot chocolate. While my favorites listed were the basics, they do have one of the most creative menus I've seen. +Friendly, helpful service!"
"This place is so excellent. The ambiance is so warm yet industrial with lots of wood, gray, and high ceilings. If you are going to eat there with more than two people, then definitely make a reservation. When I went the wait was 1.5 hours! However, the bar is open seating so since it was just me, I was able to find a seat. I started off with bread that was served with tomato oil and mushroom butter. That bread was so fresh the steam was coming off of it. It was so moist it just melted in my mouth. *wipes away drool* My entree was the Diver Scallops which were scallops in a pumpkin brandade, candied pecans, fried brussel sprouts, and pomegranate. Nom! All these different flavors and textures had me sounding like I was on an herbal essences commercial. It was so good! Great service! This place is featured for sharing dishes and great for vegetarians!"
"This place did not disappoint. The food and the service was awesome, couldn't find one thing I didn't like."
"Great place for patrons in their mid 20's to 30's. Full bar with a great selection, excellent wine list. Hard to get a seat walk -in, reservations in advance highly recommended. Chill ambience with non stop 90's old school hip and r&b that takes you back (seriously great music all might, think tone' Toni toney and beastie boys!) and in the mood. Tapas are pricey, but nonetheless worth every penny! Between the 4 of us, tapas entrees were more than enough ( and two bottles of vino) . The bread and Brussels sprouts are a must for starters! Servers are in their mid 20-30's and cater more than you can ask for. This place does not disappoint! Â Will definitely return ! Â Little goat across the street is awesome for brunch/lunch."
"The green beans were awesome. They make a great Old Fashioned as well. Only complaint would be the tight quarters, but the food and drinks are well worth it."
"Finally made it here. It has all been said and I think I was skeptical about believing the hype. But, it was true. I want to try the entire menu and come back as soon as I can. I loved our server, loved our seat and loved the decor that felt nice but so laid back and comfy. This is my kind of eating! I also am always skeptical of shared plate places and figuring out how much to order, people being weird about splitting tiny portions of things, etc. I feel like I have been missing out for the last few years on this place!"
"I absolutely loved my experience at Girl and the Goat! Our server, Gary, was fantastic and was able to give us great plate recommendations based on what we already ordered to ensure we had a strong mix of everything offered on the menu. I had the Best of Three cocktail - perfectly refreshing on a warm June day. The goat liver mousse over warm and doughy crumpets was by far my favorite dish - deliciously savory. We also tried the frog legs, pig face, escargot ravioli, and more. All fantastic and memorable. The lamb-stuffed calamari was *not* my favorite, but it didn't deter me from thoroughly enjoying our evening here. I want to go back for more!"
"One of the best meals of my life.Had the following:- pan fried shishito peppers w/ parmesan, sesame, miso- wood grilled broccoli w/ blue cheese, spiced crispies - goat belly w/ lobster, crab- pig face w/ sunny side up egg, hash browns- musselsalso had a great dessert and beer which I can't recall because I was a complete food coma near the end of the meal."
"I really wanted to be blown away by this place. I mean, they had roasted pig face on the menu; how can you not love it?We got the green beans and shishito peppers along with the short ribs and confit goat belly. Both orders of greens were good but very greasy and the green beans were overdone. The ribs were Korean cut, flavored we're spot on but the preparation left them tough rather than tender. The goat belly was ok, but a tiny portion and the fennel came on too strong. The experience was fine, just not 5 star."
"Amazing. I cannot stop raving about Girl & the Goat! I am a huge fan of places that use local ingredients and this place showcases theirs very well! For an appetizer I got the goat liver mousse with crumpets and several accoutrements. Even my husband, who rarely enjoys rich food, loved this. The mousse was amazing, super silky and full of flavor. The crumpets were piping hot and melted in your mouth. Together they combined a flavor bomb!For drinks we enjoy several of their local offerings and I was pleased to see they had FFF there. Being from New England, any occasion to enjoy their beers is a real treat. After our server recommended it, we had the Miso-Butterscotch Budino for dessert. Not only was it really well done but it was a really interesting dessert flavor-wise. I cannot wait to return to Chicago and the idea of enjoying another meal here is one of the biggest reasons why!"
"We loved GATG. We had been wanting to come here for awhile, having both (my husband and I) had crushes on Stephanie since her Top Chef days. Â  We booked a couple months in advance for 10 pm on a Friday. Â I was a little hesitant being vegetarian to eat here, what with the pig face and all... But it was delicious! Kohlrabi salad, chickpea fritters, spring rolls, and not truly vegetarian but still good green beans. Hubs had in addition goat belly and scallops. He wished he had the pig face it looked very good. Drinks were good, service good. Great atmosphere. On the green beans though- if u happen to be in Dayton OH ever go to Wheat Penny- they have made a twist on these beans and they are better! Â We will be back next time we hit up Chicago!"
"Food i would give 4 stars (read other reviews for that)... service 1 (what i'll go into here).. I felt our experience here was overshadowed by our waiter's attitude. Now.. I don't know if I can blame Him (i think his name was jason?) or management above him that he was just following orders with... but here is what happened.we had a table for 4 the first res of the evening 4:30 on a Fri. Â After we sat down he made it clear it was a small plates to share and said that we should ""order everything at once""... and he also said ""order 2 dishes per person.. i wouldnt do any more than 2 a person.. so 8 total for 4 is definitely enough"".. and we were like...ok....so he came back to the table and we had about 6 dishes in mind that we knew we wanted..then we said ""well, we can start with those and see from there"".. then he was like ""well you really should order the other 2 now because otherwise the kitchen will get backed up and I want you to have the full experience."" (whatever that means?).. so OK.. we ordered 2 more on the spot .. and this just kinda made us mad because typically with small plates you order as you go and see how full you are, see what dishes you want based on what you just had in terms of texture, flavor, protein, etc.. It was becoming clear that we were being rushed and he just wanted to get our ticket in and out..so we placed our order of 8 dishes (no more per his request) ALL AT ONCE as instructed by our waiter.. now the dishes are small.. i was expecting that, but now at dish 8... we were all still hungry (so clearly it WASNT enough!) since it was about one BITE per person per dish (except the salad)..and two of our dishes were carpaccio/sashimi so hardly any food...My husband asked for the menu again because we all wanted to order some more dishes..then the waiter said "" if you order now its gonna be at least 35-40 minutes so i wouldnt recommend it.. but here is the dessert menu"".. its like... how do you TELL people what they should and shouldnt order as they shell out $300+ for a meal?? Â he wouldnt even give us the menu and handed us the dessert menu! any other restaurant would be HAPPY to let us order more as it's obviously making them money and improving our experience but here it was clear that he just wanted us in and out.. i have NEVER had a waiter dictate how and when and what we should order like that especially at a place of this caliber.. maybe their ego is getting to their heads due to the ""great reviews""... Â  we have eaten at MANY small plate/sharing restaurants even busier than this and we always order as we go and even re-order dishes if we really liked them...is their kitchen incapable of handling this? obviously it CAN be done ...we had to go to white castle on the way home.. for real... Â i'd say if you want the stephanie izard experience.. save your money and go to little goat where it's more down to earth."
"Went to Girl and the Goat on Monday the 18th for dinner with my boyfriend. We decided last minute to try to walk in and had some luck- we only had to wait about 30 minutes! During our wait we were quickly served by a wonderful server. Unfortunately I can not remember her name but she has short black hair and glasses. We ordered a bottle of wine and she was very knowledgeable and more than willing to take a few extra minutes to guide us through their selections even though she was very busy cocktailing. We settled on an awesome Cabernet Franc and were happy as pie waiting for our turn to eat. Unfortunately our pleasant experience ended when we were brought to our table. We were seated at a large community style table with 2 other couples- this would be totally fine with me if there weren't many other open tables by this time of the night. We use community tables at my work as well, so I understand the concept- however, it is just not very romantic.Our server ALISON took quite a while to come by and greet us. We ordered to scallops, green beans, and goat belly to eat. The scallops came first. WHAT A HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT! They were cooked so terribly that when I cut into it there was no way to make a clean cut- the scallop pulled away from each other in a weird stringy gum-like fashion. Again, I work in a restaurant so I understand everyone is only human and mistakes in the kitchen can be made- so this would have been totally fine if Alison has swung by even once to check on us but since we literally did not see her again until she dropped off our check there was no way for me to get this issue fixed. Â I will say- the green beans with the fish sauce aioli were delicious and the goat belly was tasty as well. I have never had goat before so I am happy to say I tried something delicious and new. Anyways- the last issue that I had was back with the bottle of wine we had ordered earlier in the evening. My boyfriend and I were about to finish up our meal and order a desert so we poured ourselves each about half a glass more and planned the pack up the other half of the bottle to bring home for later. For whatever reason a cork was not left at our table with the bottle so we were not able to put the cork back in ourselves. Like I said earlier- we did not see our server during our entire meal until she came to see if we would like desert/drop off our check. As she was walking up to the table I had my head turned looking at a painting that was behind us in the dining area and of course the only 30 seconds of attention we get from Alison she takes the liberty to pour an extremely large amount of wine into each of our already half full glasses without asking if we would like more. I turned around and was very upset to find that she had only left about 1/2 a glass in the bottle to be wrapped then gave me attitude when I asked for it to be wrapped (""because it wasn't enough to take home"") and when I said that I wished she had asked us before dumping half a bottle of wine in our glasses she just said ""Oh"" and walked away.I really wish we had just eaten at the couch in the waiting room. It would have been much better service with our cocktail waitress. It is such a shame that a place of this caliber would have such a rude, unprofessional, and inattentive server such as Allison. She completely ruined our meal which ended up ruining our night. Will most likely never return because of her."
"An excellent restaurant to go for any occasion. Chef Izard and co. concoct amazing, unique, interesting and delicious tasting dishes. I haven't had anything like this before so def a unique experience for me. I liked it a lot. Try their Beet Salad, Chick pea fritters, Roasted Cauliflowers, Onion bread, Goat Empanadas, Escargot Ravioli and more. Menu changes every now and then. Priced on the expensive side but not unexpected. Excellent service. Reservations are highly recommended. 4.5 stars"
"This is one of those joints where everyone looks cool, because the ambiance trumps everyone's appearance. Â Come in wearing a fanny pack. Â Come in wearing shoulder pads like Delta Burke from Designing Women. Â Ain't no one lookin atchew. Â You're just automatically cool for being there.Well actually...the table next to us had 5 really good-lookin guys on a guys nite out. Â So.. maaaaybe people are lookin atchew. Â Although those 5 guys could've been wearing white socks and black loafers for all I know. Â I dunno. Â I wasn't lookin at their feet. Â Or was I. (p_-)Anywayz. Â Girl wasn't there that day. Â Sux. Â The Goat though, was like, all over the place. Â On the menu. Â On the wall. Â On the serving plate. Â On the napkin holder. Â On the clipboard that holds the bill. Â Sommmmmebody loves himself. Â Narcissistic ass goat.So outta the 5 plates we had, 3 were memorable:roasted cauliflower pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint 11 - I will remember you.fried loup de mer bacon sweet n' sour . potato aioli . tempura broccoli 16 - I will remember you.crisp braised pork shank butternut-shiitake kimchee, buttermilk dressing 25 - I will remember you. Â 'Cept the buttermilk dressing. Â Forget you.confit goat belly bourbon butter. lobster n' crab.fennel 19 - ? Â Don't even remember you.thai chili chocolate gelato Â brownie. peanut butter fluff . pomegranate seeds . cocoa nibs 8 - I mean, I kinda recall. Â But, really...I don't.Oh! Â The bathrooms are downstairs in what seemed like a dungeon. Â It was SO dark going down. Â It was equally dark in the stall. (individual private stalls) It only contained one shabby bulb that looked like it was on it's last watt. Â It dawned on me that this wasn't an electrical shortage but more of a decor choice. Â For who? Â Hannibal Lecter? Freddy Krueger? Â This was horror movie status. You'll wipe your ass so fast (if you could find the toilet paper in the dark, or your ass Â - for that matter) to get outta that situation, quick. Â I no likezit.So boo-ooo-oo-oo to you, Goat - for the scary bathroom ambiance. Â Did you catch that. Â I said boo-ooo-oo-oo, kinda like ""baaaaaa"" like a goat. Â Or is that a sheep. Â A ram? Â A lamb. Â A ding-dong! Â Oh man did u see what I just did there? Â Ram-a lamb-a ding-dong! Â From that song? Â You know...""Who put the bomp in the bomp bah bomp bah bomp? Who put the ram in the rama lama ding dong..."" .......yeah? Â No?I gotta stay off the crack."
Food was okay. Expecting something better from the other reviews.The parking situation was kind of a mess. Valet guys were jerks. Try to find some place else to park.
"My husband and I have added this dining experience to the list of most memorable and amazing meals (our wedding and honeymoon meals are on this list). It was UH-MAAAAAYZING! We both love food and have no problem trying new things. I wondered if it was going to be as good as what it's hyped up to be and trust me when i say that it's better. The fact that you have to wait 2 months for a Friday night reservation does not surprise me one bit and it was so worth the wait. Now to the important things! The ambiance was fantastic. Beautiful, clean restaurant. You could go casual or dressed up, it wouldn't matter. We had a 6:15 reservation, got there at 5:45 and sat at the bar until our ""table"" was ready, right on time. I had ""the earhart"" which is a lemon martini infused with lavender. Loved it! My husband had an old fashion and a couple beers with no complaints. He said the whiskey was really good. We were seated at what the hostess called ""the best table in the restaurant"" which was at the bar watching the cooks work their magic. I can't even describe how awesome this made our meal! The cooks were so nice and fun to chat with. Plus we got to see and smell all the food they were making. ONLY DOWNSIDE (and I would still sit their again in a heartbeat), it was hot and my hair didn't survive, but I will take one for the team. Our waiter was fantastic as well! So friendly and helpful. He truly helped make our experience better. We wanted to try as much as we could so here you go (I suggest doing the same)... roasted cauliflower, wood grilled broccoli (favorite), wood fired scallops (favorite), duck tongue, wood oven roasted pig face, busta rye bread, gouda bacon bread (with delicious spreads... smoked fat back butter?! yess please), goat empanadas, goat loin (favorite) Â and last, but not least dessert: miso-butterscotch budino (favorite) and rhubarb shortcake. The items that were not favorites were still delicious! I think I would go back and order the favorites plus add a couple new things to try.Chef Izard truly is a Top Chef and extremely talented. The flavors that she creates are genius. I will be back!"
"We have been trying to get in here for the past few years each time we visit Chicago (by no fault of there own) We have always just been to air-headed about making reservations. This time I made sure to make them 4 months out. It so did not disappoint. Â I arrived just before our reservation (5pm on 04/28) and since my better half was finishing speaking at a conference I couldn't be seated yet (no problem at all with that, if you have issues then your an impatient ass) They did say please have a seat at the bar if you like or on the couches to the left. Great start, did not make me feel like I was a bother, gave me Â couple of choices to pass the time (this should be done anywhere) I decided to have a seat at the bar where I was greeted by all the wonderful bar staff. I ordered a Manhattan (w/ Blantons bourbon) made perfectly. First properly made Manhattan since we got to Chicago. My wife showed up and we were sat immediately. Hunter was our server and did a fantastic job of going over the menu with us and did not seam rushed at all, made us feel like the only patrons in the place. We ordered 5 dishes, Onion bread (OMG!!!) Shishito peppers with cheese (OMG again), Duck Tongues ( I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE THINK BUT omg, LITTLE CRISPY BITES OF YUMMY GOODNESS, Cauliflower (one of our favorites) and the Diver Scallops. By this time I wsa stuffed and was only able to shove one bite in my mouth but how incredibly good it was. I cannot wait to come back to Chicago as we will be eating here again and again and again............and AGAIN!!!!!!"
I've been dying to go here for months. Finally got a reservation and I was impressed with most of their dishes. I would skip the bread it was just ok. Their cauliflower and green beans were really good their chicken and pig face was to die for be sure to save room for dessert that was the best part. Service was pretty good but not great
"I really tried not to like this place. Â I did my best. Â I figured that it was over-hyped and there was just no way that this place could meet expectations. Â Then somehow, it did. Â Highlights: Pig face, confit goat belly, octopus, amazing scallops. Â Writing this review is making me want to go back.I still hate the name, but every course was well-balanced and delicious, service was great, and it was a good time.. Â It's loud in here, but a good place for a date or a group of friends. Â It is expensive, but worth it.Oh well, I guess sometimes the hype is right. Â I'm sorry, hype - I apologize for doubting you."
"Overall Experience - 5Service- 5Price- 5Food - 4.5Ambiance/decor-4.5This truly is as good as you get for the price point. I went with my husband and brother in-law to Girl and the Goat Â a week ago. The decor is very nice and upscale with a little trend mixed in. Our table was a little crowded and the place was pretty loud but not too loud where you couldn't hear your self and each other at the table. Our server was very eccentric but hilarious and VERY helpful. His suggestions were on point and usually our favorites. He was very attentive as was all the staff. It was top notch service. We ordered quite a bit of food but they are small plates which I love because you can have a little bit of everything!To start:-Country sourdough bread with honey butter and applesauce - yummy!-Wood fired oysters - Loved them; some of the best I've ever had. The oysters are slightly wood fired but still raw which completely removes the sometimes fishy/watery taste of oysters - deliciousGoat Empanadas - very good; 2 per order; nice appetizer if you are little scared of trying goat as there are many goat dishes to choose from.Mains:-pan fried shishito peppers w/ Parmesan - one of my favorite things we ordered - so yummy - husband was worried about them being spicy and they were not spicy - perfect amount of heat-roasted cauliflower - pine nuts, pickled peppers and mint - delicious-Hamachi Crudo- OK -we all agreed that this was the one thing we wouldn't order again as it paled in comparison to the rest of the meal-Pan roasted halibut - Amazing - Best thing we had that night - so buttery and delicious-Wood oven roasted pig face w/ sunny side egg - this was great! Different and tasty - The boys loved it - A must orderDesert:-Plantain Cake - table next to use said it was the best desert they have ever had so we ordered it. Very interesting desert - nothing like you have ever had before. The cake has a distinct plaintain flavor which made it and the ice cream was good but at times bland if you didn't mix all ingredients. Not the best any of us had ever had but OK and different-miso-butterscotch budino - server brought out for free because he said it was his favorite - should have ordered 2! It was delicious! We all agreed this was amazing! The desert was a cross between a gooey butter cake and a butterfinger. SOOOO good. Drinks: Guys ordered beer - lots of variety but the were out of Oatmeal Stout which bummed my husband outI had the Best of Three Cocktail - delicious but not strong enough for $13 a drink; switched to wine and it was good.Overall - we will MOST definitely go again and order some of them same items but would like to try everything on the menu - the dishes are that good and that unique."
"I would say that it's overall solid, but that my go-to for sitting at a bar and eating well remains the Purple Pig. Food was quite tasty, but wines were not well-priced, and cocktails were just variations on standards like the Manhattan or Negroni. Nothing at all wrong with it, just that I know I have Â better options. I personally would tell you to go with some of the goat options over the much-hyped pig face. The face is good, but basically, it's a pressed section of various slow-cooked head cuts. The processing destroys a lot of the uniqueness and individuality of those specific cuts.Major points go to the staff, however. Bar staff were knowledgeable about the menu and the drinks, service was prompt despite the place being packed to the gills, and they did not hurry along anyone."
Visiting Chicago and went to dinner last night for my birthday. Made reservations about 3 months ago. There were 5 of us. Service was exceptional and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu. It was very busy - so noisy - and a little hard to hear him at times. This is a small plates style restaurant. He recommend that we order 12-15 plates. It was WAY too much for a group of ladies. We would've been fine with 8-9 plates - especially at an average of $16 per plate. The vegetable portions were large compared to the other plates. Food was delicious and we loved most of it. Our vegetables were the broccoli (smoky flavor and not as good as the cauliflower) and the cauliflower (yum!) and the chickpea fritter (this was good). Our breads were the green bean casserole (don't waste your time) and the jackolantern (liked it). We tried goat empanadas and liked it a lot for never having goat. We got two types of oysters: fried naked cowboy and wood fired (my fave). For fish we got the striped bass (wasn't my favorite). For meat we got the pork shank (delicious but we were getting really full by this time) and the crispy pig face (the best dish of the night). Even though we were full and asked waiter to remove a striped bass from our order (he said too late) he sent out a complimentary goat carpaccio - which I think was new and they were trying to market to tables. Not my favorite but it was good. For dessert we ordered Apple buckle (loved!) and they gave a budding for free for my birthday ( not as good as the buckle). Overall - a great dining experience.
"After hearing about how AWESOME Girl and the Goat was a group of us decided we needed to check it out for ourselves... so I made a reservation for 12. Â Since it was such a large group and we didn't want to eat at either 4pm or 10/11 pm we were given a reservation 5 months in advance. Â I have since learned that with a party half that size you can get a reservation about 2 months in advance.To say I loved my experience at Girl and the Goat is an understatement. Â I L-O-V-E-D my experience at G&G(!) Â First off, I loved the table they have for parties of 10 -12. Â It's by the open kitchen and set back from all the other tables. Â Our server was nice and helpful. Â She also humored me when I gushed over the food at the end of the meal (bonus points earned!).The food lived up to the hype! Â The Apple Smacks bread is YUM! YUM! YUM! Â I loved the ginger butter - which might I say I'm not one to gush over ginger. Â Also, I loved that it also came with Apple Sauce which I used to dip the Felafel I ordered. Â The Felafel was full of flavor and tasty! Â I also had the Braised Beef Ribs. Â Now, I will say that they didn't fall off the bone like I like Beef Ribs to do, but they were tasty. Â Lastly, there was dessert... OMG!!!! Â You must! Â I repeat... YOU MUST! order the PB&J dessert if available. Â Three donut Holes covered in peanut butter sauce, with chopped up peanuts, some ice cream and grape gelato. Â This dessert is the BOMB! Â It was so good I am not ashamed to say I was scraping the bottom of my bowl as they were taking it away. Â The only problem I had with Girl and the Goat was that it's a very loud environment. Â However, I really didn't expect it to not be so that was what it was. Â This was definitely a meal I look forward to repeating again."
"The food, dining experience, ambiance and service was the norm, Â nothing stood out."
"Stopped by for drinks while waiting for our reservation at Au Cheval. Bartenders were so friendly & attentive. Great drinks! We were starving so we ordered the pretzel bread, which was delicious. Loved the rustic decor."
"Walk in at 5:30 for a dinner for four. Got very lucky, and got a seat. Should probably have reserved. Ordered 8 courses in total. The goat carpaccio was my favorite, the blend of favors fit very well together with the raw meet. The taste especially comes out with the fish roe popping in your mouth. Brilliant. The restaurant offers modern style dishes, in a Â friendly environment with balanced service. Live up to its name definitely. (If you're under age, ask for the Happy Juice, a non-alcoholic bar juice, won't disappoint)"
"If this was a neighborhood cafe, where you'd come casually, seated right away, and quietly ate tapas-style decently done homey food and drank beer, Girl & the Goat would earn a solid 4-star from me. However, our Saturday reservation was made 3 months in advance, and only by chance, the place is over-crowded, noisy and a bit more expensive than it's worth. They have fine tap beers, and we did have a good time there with the friends. But, there is not much to warrant a repeat visit. Smart Chicagoans, think twice before patronizing any of the West Loop restaurants. As a rule, they are overhyped and joyless."
"Love it!! Great culinary fun in a relaxing , unstuffy atmosphere.. Defiantly a great value in my opinion.. My favorite was the pigs face.. Very inventive dishes, do have the boudin for dessert!"
"4.5 stars, minus 0.5 for whoever knocked over the salt shaker into Every. Single. Dish. In 3 words, the meal can be described as: Heavy...but delicious.Friday 4:30pm reservation. 5 dishes + 1 bread. 1) Not Campbells bread - served with this creamy mushroom soup butter + tart tomato soup oil, which were equally loved. The bread of the day was actually broccoli cheese soup, with EVERYTHING baked INTO the bread itself. Holy god. Hot fluffy bread with a nice crust but flavorful and moist. Grade: A. 2) Sauteed green beans - The creamy fish sauce dressing was a nice touch, which made the perfectly sauteed green beans uber unique...if only it wasn't SO salty and heavy. The ""fattiest"" beans I've ever tasted in this lifetime. Grade: B.3) Seared Scallops - 2 big scallops over a (finally!) light sauce with veal and almond butter, which I didn't taste at all. The scallops were perfectly seared and the sauce complemented it perfectly. Grade: A-.4) Steamed clams - The saltiest blackbean sauce clams I've ever eaten. I was LEAST impressed with this dish because i believe fresh clams should be cooked in a lighter sauce. The flavor should sing without many bells and whistles. Unfortunately, these clams were drowned in a saltwater bath. Grade: B-. 5) Crisp soft shell crab - Loooooved These. The legs were crunchy, light fried crispy. The body of the crab was so juicy, soft and tender. Served over a delicious creamy curry-flavored sauce. To die for. Grade: A+. 6) Grilled baby octopus - Another hit!! Loved Stephanie Izzard's combination of vegetables with the nicely grilled baby octopus. A bowl of fun, fresh flavors that perfectly complement the star = octopus!!! Grade: A. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago = Up there with MK and Graham Elliot!! I was majorly impressed with the flavors and the great service. Stephanie Izzard deserves her Top Chef win!!! Last words - This restaurant is perfect for a date. The plates are small, tapas-style and the more people you bring to share your plate of food, the smaller your bites will get, and the hungrier you will be by the time you leave."
"The service and ambiance were outstanding. The food was... good. Not mind-blowing. Maybe I ordered wrong. Got shishito peppers (delicious, but there were way too many of them), goat liver mousse (eh), pig face and chicken. I'd skip the chicken and liver next time. And for 2 people with pretty decent appetites, the recommended 4 plates was just way too much food, since everything was so rich. All in all had a good time, will definitely go back and try a few other items."
"During a recent trip to Chi-town we went for dinner at the Girl and the Goat. Â A friend had raved that it was the it spot and I have to say, he was on target; this place was an amazing culinary experience! Â First off, a reservation is key! Â Even reserving weeks ahead, we were only able to get a table at 9. Â Upon arrival the restaurant was PACKED, luckily we didn't have to wait too long for our table. Â Moving onto the food, our waiter recommended ordering 2-3 dishes a person, personally I would say stick to 2 and then add later if you're still hungry as we ordered way too much, though everything was really tasty!BREAD:Sour Dough w/ mushroom butter & tomato + oil - I LOVE mushrooms I can't really say anything but amazing things about this platter. Â The mushroom butter was a first and I really liked it. Â I personally didn't like the tomato oil as much, but if you put the butter on your bread then dip it in the tomato oil, it's a winner!VEGGIES:SautÃ©ed green beans + Roasted Cauliflower + Pan fried Shishito Peppers - Yum, Yum, Yum! Â These paired perfectly with the meat and fish dishes selected. Â Each dish was distinct and very flavorful! Â All are a definite must try!FISH:Grilled Baby Octopus - The sauce on this dish was amazing and really made this dish! Â I loved the assortment of veggies that it came with too. Â A definite must try!Country Fried Loup de Mer - We were told this was similar to a black cod, but I'm not quite sure it was.. either way, it was pretty tasty. Â Make sure you get all the sauces on this dish when you try it!Diver Scallops - Full of flavor, these were pretty good.Escargot Ravioli - When I saw the word 'Escargot' my stomach turned a little, but when I tried it, it wasn't bad at all! Â If you're a escargot virgin like me, it's a pretty good way to try it. Â MEAT:Goat Empenadas - I'm glad I tried them, but if I went back I think I would try something different from the goat menu. Â Crisp Braised Pork Shank - Nom, Nom, Nom, so delish! Â The meat just fell off the bone.. literally! Â Don't miss out on this dish, it's a WINNER!Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - Don't be turned off by the words 'Pig Face,' this dish is worth a try.DESSERTMiso-Butterscotch Budino - How do you say no to anything bacon toffee glazed!?! Â You don't. Â Just order it - you won't be disappointed!All in all, I give it 2 thumbs up and definitely recommend you give it a try!"
I had never been to Girl & the Goat before but my friend recommended it. Â I took my fiancÃ© there for a surprise birthday dinner and all I can say is WOW! Â The food was spectacular and the dining experience was beautiful! Â Great food. Â Great people. Â Great setting! Â We'll be going again.
Someone else loves Girl & The Goat! Surprise of surprises!Short and sweet then. The space is huge and intimate. The servers are a delight and helpful beyond belief. Both of us have food restrictions (although we may have made a few exceptions this night) and our waiter went through everything and made sure that if an adjustment to a dish had to be made it was done.The food is to die for and the Pig Face is the best thing you could possibly put in your mouth. We shared a cocktail before our appetizer arrived and then had a bottle of (delicious) wine. Left feeling tipsy and stuffed and happy. Make a reservation. Bring an empty belly. Be happy.
"Thanks to yelp I had a really high expectation from this place, but the experience turned out to be just OK.Everything tastes good, service quality was great, but nothing let me feel that this is the best restaurant behind Alinea. Many dishes Surprisingly have an Asian influence, but not spectacular.There are many plate-sharing restaurants in Chicago, and personally I don't think Girl & the Goat is the best one."
"My boyfriend had to make reservations a month before we came here! Â I'm glad he did bc it was packed when we arrived for our 9pm Monday night dinner reservation. Â We got seated at the counter so we got to watch the chefs cook. Â Oh gosh, do they work. Â Anyway, the food and service was great! Â The food was unique and tasted delicious. Â I believe we got five dishes. Â Come here! Â You won't regret it!"
"We got together at the Girl and the Goat to enjoy a delicious dinner with family and friends. We ordered to share sautÃ© GREEN BEANS, KOHLRABI SALAD, CHICKPEA FRITTER, roasted cauliflower, scallops, ESCARGOT RAVIOLI, MT. LASSEN TROUT, grilled marinated PORK BELLY, roasted PIG FACE, SHORT RIBS and 3/4 desserts (no pomegranate for the table) along a couple of cocktails and bottles of wine. The meal was superb! We even end up repeating a couple of dishes ...we couldn't have enough i guess. The items in caps were the group favourites. The staff was amazing and very attentive regardless of their busy dinning room. we all had a great night!"
"It's been over a year since I was there, but I've seen so many gushing reviews that I felt compelled to write one. Girl & the Goat is one of those places that you just HAVE to go, or so it seems. After making reservations a couple months in advance, I had the pleasure of finally going there. It was okay, as the three stars say. Cool room, super loud (which I don't mind), tasty cocktails and good, not great, food. They were out of the legendary pig face about which I've heard so much, but we tried a good number of plates and I was blown away by nothing. In fact, a scallop & kimchee dish we had was so salty it was practically inedible and kind of ruined the whole experience for me. That said, the food and experience were above average, but do not warrant the hype and demand for this place. I can think of a number of joints with similar menus that would provide an equal or better experience without the wait, but, if you need to tell your friends ""Oh yah, I've like totally been there and ermahgerd it was like so AWE-soooome,"" then by all means confirm that Tuesday at 10:30 reservation and knock your socks off."
"Well what more can I say to convince you this place is legit with 2,800+ reviews and a 4.5 avg you obviously know it's amazing and worth the headache of getting a res'.The staff here are super friendly and the atmosphere is just right: loud and happy with great music. You can mos def enjoy G&G as a couple but quite honestly I wish we would have come with at least four, so that we could have tried more dishes. I would recommend 2 dishes/person, my gf and I did 4+bread and barely made it out alive. Speaking of which we had the Onion bread, which was amazing; cooked as crumpets they came out light and fluffy. We then had the Diver Scallops which were phenomenal, IMO, the best dish of the night, just after you know what. The spices were pushed to the limit of being to much and then left for you to enjoy. What was great about this dish is that the scallops came through unscathed and tasted fresh. Then we had the Escargot Ravioli, also amazing, the pasta was cooked el dente, or as I like to say, ""The right way."" We then followed that up with the Goat Empanadas, which were stuffed with goat and also showcased the goats flavor, def a plus. Finally, we finished with the Pig Face. How could we not?! Quite honestly I was skeptical that it would hold up to the rest of the meal, plus we were quite full by the time it was served. But, hands down, it was the best dish of the night. First, in the words of Tony B. ""I'm an egg slut,"" so anything that is served with a creamy yolk on top has a head start. Next, the meat was cooked PERFECTLY and portioned out just right. Literally every bite had just the right amount of each ingredient.Suffice it so say, I could come back here a dozen times and never grow tired of the menu. My hat is off to you Chef Izard and team."
"Get past the Sunda-on-a-Saturday-night loud and just stuff your face.That's all you gotta do.Woooosa and eat in a near meditation because the girls' night out diners next to you are gonna ramble about that guy and this guy and those shoes and OMG about every 15 seconds that you'll wonder if the world is devoid of human beings who can carry on a conversation with substance.And they'll sit there, analyzing the menu and question the waiter why certain ingredients are being used because ""it sounds too weird"" (verbatim, bt-dubs). And they'll be too close for comfort for you to be able to do anything. You'll want to yell and chuck their YSL Tribs in their face and banish them to a TGIFridays.But like I said, woooosa and eat. Flash 'Keep Calm and Carry On' images in your mind if you have to.Because if you let all that other crap get to ya you'll miss out on a kick-ass menu comprised of nearly every animal part of a goat and it's all beyond delicious. You'll miss out on luscious goat cheese on soft, house made bread. You'll miss out on a ginormous goat's neck. You'll miss out on fatty confit goat belly. Goat goat goat rockin' everywhere.Don't even sweat it if you're one of those eaters who's tagging along for the ride because your friends invited you but you don't want to be trying anything goat-esque and they don't want to cancel or trim the reservation because who in their right mind would do so when it takes nearly 90 days to get a seat here?I still say you're missing out, but if that's how you roll, I've got some suggestions. I'm pretty sure this was the only moment in my entire life to be earnestly enthused about eating vegetables. The chickpea fritters are so out of this world, for lack of better words, that you may wonder if there's rendered bacon fat or something in there that might make it addicting for a rather one-sided omnivore. The kohlrabi salad is refreshing with a light ginger dressing that doesn't overpower the entire thing. If you're up for seafood, try the scallops or the wood-fired oysters. Or y'know, gobble down some pig face with that orgasmic tamarind sauce.This may be off-menu now but if it ever comes back, beg for the chocolate Thai chili gelato for dessert. It's some of the richest chocolate cake in existence, with peanut fluff, pomegranate, and left hand milk stout. I mean, C'MON."
"I went here with my boyfriend on a Monday night. Â We got there around 4:45 and grabbed a spot at the bar. Â It's actually a great place to sit as the service is phenomenal sitting there.We were greeted right away and offered menus. Â We only drank beer while we were there because they had good beers to choose from. Â They also had Gary and Steph's Wedding Beer on tap while we were there.For entrees we had the pig face and the ahi tuna. Â The ahi tuna was amazing and the pig face was good. Â After that we had the bittersweet chocolate and PB&J desserts. Â This place does dessert incredibly well, and the PB&J dessert was phenomenal.The service here was perfect. Â The bartenders were friendly and we never had empty drinks.This place was great and I would definitely come back."
"A two month in advance reservation definitely hyped up this place for me. The entire day before I came here I kept thinking ""this place better be good!"" I went with a group of 3, including myself and I find it to be the perfect number in comparison to the sizes of the dishes. Now let's dig into our order: confit goat belly . bourbon butter . lobster n' crab . fennel -- seconds please! the confit goat belly has the perfect crunch to it. real lobster & crab, no imitation here folks! the bourbon butter just compliments the entire dish perfectly. wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix -- oven roasted pig face was a bit on the dry side, but with the potato stix it had a nice crunch texture. sunny side egg, is just another sunny side egg. goat, pork and veal sugo . pappardelle . rosemary . cape goose berries -- the goose berries were a nice surprise of flavor. extremely meaty with the goat, pork, & veal. grilled hanger steak . trumpets . ramps . miso-marcona almond . green almond nuoc charn -- cooked to perfection! the flavor was absolutely delicious. linguine n' clams . veal & pork . rock shrimp . snow peas . horseradish -- good portion. i enjoyed the crumbled veal & pork. however, something was off about this dish. maybe the horseradish? skewered lamb heart . sweetbread crisp . potato aioli . ramps . strawberry -- cooked perfectly with a great sauce and the strawberries adds a nice touch. chickpeas fritters . romesco . hazelnut hummus . sesame . goat feta -- good veggie dish topped with sriracha, which gave it a nice little kick. bittersweet chocolate . shiitake gelato . toffee creme fraiche -- this didn't cut it for me. i think the shiitake gelato threw me off completely. blood orange sorbet . parsnip pot de creme . pistachio cake . three sisters cornmeal crust -- a great dessert if everything is eaten together. separately it wouldn't work. Service: Waitress -- at the beginning she was fantastic. talked about some of her favorite dishes and why we should try them. towards the end she took about 10 minutes to give us a dessert menu then about another 10 for our check. i under it was busy, but picking up a menu and placing it on our table isn't hard. Food -- the spacing of the dishes was fantastic until the end when it took a little longer (like it was never going to come out) Bussers -- five star! my water was constantly refilled (never was it below 1/2 empty) and I absolutely love that we get new plates for each dish. I find to be awesome because than I don't mix together the different flavors from each dish. Overall, we ordered 6 entrees and 1 dessert (skewered lamb heart & bittersweet chocolate were on the house because a friend is friends with one of the chef) and our bill came out to $111, which I find to be pricey probably because I'm not a big enthusiast on shared plates, but girl & the goat might be swaying it."
"I loved this place. We did an impromptu trip to Chicago over the weekend and was given a recommendation to come here. It turns out that due to the impromptu nature of my trip I had buckleys of getting a reservation (I was told they book out 3-4 months in advance) however they do have dedicated tables for walk-ins. We arrived there around 6:00PM, thankfully we'd eaten too much pizza around the corner earlier, so we weren't hungry as the wait for a table was 1.5 hrs. We enjoyed a few delicious cocktails at the bar before being seated. (we could have eaten at the bar too almost straight away)The food was delicious, some of it has funny names (like Pigs face) but don't let that deter you, it doesn't look at you when it comes out and it's not actually a face :)"
"I Had the pleasure of going here with my sister and Nephew. Started off with a loaf of fresh bread with goat cheese baked in. Delicious and there are a few options. Most of the dishes are made to share, so we ordered a bunch. Highlights were the fried duck tongue on Ahi poke with black beans, duck fat french fries, fried squash blossoms and the grilled octopus which I could probably eat every day. It is a cozy environment so if you like having lots of space and not talking to your neighbors this may not be for you. This however is not a great place for kids as there are few options other than bread and french fries that most kids would eat, even though I could live off that. I would go back again and again Â if I lived in the windy city, one of my favorite all time restaurants. Ask your server for recommendations also they are very good at telling you whats best."
Great experience. Customer service was spot on from the time we walked in and the food matched the service!
"Such a delight to find such quality food in Chicago in a spacious Williamsburg-rustic warehouse-cool restaurant. The Pig Face was by far the best, the Goat Carpaccio was fun, I'd skip the Goat Belly. We ordered expecting NYC ""small plates"" portions for the prices, and our waist bands were punishing.Dessert was comped. By the way, we got our reservation for 4 at 5pm Labor Day Sunday the week of."
"You know how sometimes a restaurant is hyped up so much and you finally get there and it's nothing but one disappointment after another? This place won't be one of those. Stephanie Izard knows her stuff. We started off with the green beans because our server recommended them. They were good, sauteed with fish sauce I believe? Definitely had a big Asian influence. Next was the goat belly. Pork belly is one of those cuts of meat that separate the men from the boys so goat belly would be a true test of a cook. In one word, amazing. Flavorful, tender, seasoned just right. It was probably my favorite dish of the night. We ordered the pig face as well and it came with a sunny side egg on top. I'm a sucker for anything with an egg on top so I might be biased on this dish. The yolk added a richness to the meat and crispy noodles underneath. Very well done. We finished with the miso butterscotch budino. I could definitely taste the butterscotch, I couldn't really detect the miso in there. Overall another solid choice and it was delicious, but I don't think it was on the same level as the meat dishes. Just my two cents."
"It's a fun place with a good vibe and friendly staff. The menu is varied (both for food and libations). They won't seat you until your entire party has arrived, but their waiting area has nice lounge style sofas, and they will serve you drinks as you wait. This combination gave me a great first impression. Everything we ordered was delicious (it is tapas-style so you get to try a lot of different plates), and they are very accommodating to vegetarians, as well. I've heard it is difficult to get a reservation here, but somehow we managed to get a same-day table for six on a Saturday night. Even so, I would recommend you RSVP early, but there is no harm in calling to see if their has been a cancellation."
everything and more. Â everything and more!
"Sat at the bar with no wait.Roasted Cauliflower - Was pretty good. Probably as good as cauliflower can get. I'm not really too much of a vegetable person, though. If I was, this probably would have been mind blowing.Ham frites - Definitely had a strong ham/bacon flavor. Thin small fries with some sort of powder on it. The smoked tomato aioli was pretty good. The cheddar beer sauce tasted kinda funky - Â not surprised though. The fries themselves were definitely a bit too salty though.Sugo - Fat flat noodles perfectly done with this a pork, goat, and beef sauce. This was great. Would eat this all the time.Wood oven roasted pig face - Not bad, but some pieces were very dry. Other pieces were nice and fatty. Didn't really taste too much different. The egg didn't really add much in my opinion."
"This place is know for serving Small Plates, almost like tapas. So be prepared to order 3-4 items on the menu for two people, any more than that and you'll be rolling yourself out of the restaurant. What we ordered:-Kona Kampachi Crudo - crunch pieces of pork belly that was pretty assertive in flavor (tasted like it had been marinating in fish sauce) on top of flat pieces of kampachi/yellowtail sashimi. -Roasted Beets - heavenly, thin slices of beets on top of a light salad-Goat Empanadas - I was expecting meat that tasted more closer to lamb but was pleasantly surprised that it didn't have that gamey quality. The empanadas were also surprisingly light and crisp. Definitely recommend it if its your first time trying goat's meat. -Wood fired Pig's Face - melt-in-your mouth, tender meat! Delicious. It seems like so little at first, but by the fourth plate I was definitely feeling it. So don't get too carried away in ordering right off the bat unless you know you're hankering for a food-coma afterwards."
Goatgasm for sure. Â Great place. Â Only for 4 stars instead of 5 is: communal seating is lame
"After dining here last night, I am a definite fan of Girl & the Goat but I'm still deciding if it was worth the 6 week wait for a reservation.The restaurant is very loud, so if you plan on coming here for a romantic evening or to catch up with a friend, you should go elsewhere. Service was great. Our server was friendly and attentive and never let our wine glasses go empty.Almost everything we ordered was delicious (I would skip on the ham frites, as they are nothing special).Highlights: shishito peppers, roasted cauliflower, pig face (amazing!), goat empanadas, shrimp ceviche & squash blossom rangoon."
"I waited an hour on a Sunday night to be seated here, but wow -- it was worth the wait!The ambiance here is at once rustic and romantic, with a bustling kitchen and a happy crowd. Â Our service was friendly and patient and answered all our questions and recommendation requests to my satisfaction. Â The style here is small plates, so you usually want to order 2-3 plates per person and share everything.I'm just going to go ahead and say that, to my surprise, my absolute favorite dish here was the sauteed green beans! Â Given that all our other orders were meat and seafood, I didn't expect that my favorite would be a vegetable. Â But this dish is something else entirely...I am not sure I've ever tasted as much umami in a green bean dish as I did here. Â Absolutely delightful.Other favorites included pig's face (slightly sweet and very crispy pork belly with a beautifully fried egg on top) and the diver scallops.The chocolate magic shell dessert was also out-of-this-world, but I couldn't even finish it because I was so full from having stuffed my face full of all the incredible dinner dishes."
"My experience here was very good. Â  Loved the chicken, ""not campbells"" and skate wing. Â 9 dishes were plenty for a group of 4. Â  Great coffee. Â They don't serve Amstel Light and I wanted more beer/wine by the glass selections :( Â A lot of unusual meats grace the menu, on this day they served (but I did not try) duck tongues."
"""Drink as much beer as the goat.""I love Girl and the Goat's motto of enjoying life. Indeed, sharing great food with your friends is a great way to enjoy the little things in life. Best shitto peppers in town, hands down. The creamy texture of the sauce enhances the crunchiness and the spice of the peppers. The other vegetarian options are quite good too. I AM DEFINITELY COMING BACK!Food: 5Decor: 5Service: 5"
"It only took me 3 months to get a reservation for 4 on a Tuesday at 7:45 pm, but it was for sure not a let down after all the hype and anticipation. Love Love this place. The place was packed when we got there, but we were warmly and promptly greeted and seated. The place has a rustic industrial look, with exposed beams, brick walls, dark wood- I like it already. Our server was very attentive and knowledgeable...gave us some good pointers. Now onto the best part--the food! There were 4 of us, and this was an appropriate amount of food--full but not uncomfortable full.Woodfired oysters - Fresh, briny. Had the smokiness of bacon, the kick of horseradish, and some tang of the preserved lemon. I don't like big fat oysters, but these were a little too small..sort of a teaseSoft shelled crab - nice and crisp, the fregola and asparagus salad gave it some nice textures. Charred port belly - mmm need I say more? Savory, tangy, melts in your mouthDiver scallops - my 2nd favorite of the night. Who does brown butter kimchi? They do, and it's spectacular. Scallops were sweet and perfectly cooked...so silky. Hazelnut rapini gave it texture and greens...gotta have your greens. Grilled baby octopus - I didn't care for this one. Octopus was tender, but there was too much lemon, and something kind of bitter in there. I could eat it, but wouldn't order it again. Â deduct half a starEscargot ravioli - I was very excited for this one, expecting buttery goodness, but ended up disappointed. It was just so bland. The escargot a little tough. deduct half a starWood oven roasted pig face- my favorite of the night. They totally redeemed themselves after the last 2 dishes. I'm so glad I convinced my mom to order this because I would've been sad to find out later I missed out. It wasn't a pig's head like my mom was afraid it was going to be. They're slices of the cheek, and they were oh. so. crispy!!!! The tamarind, cilantro, red-wine maple--all things I would never think of putting together, but they marry so well!! It was topped off with crisp potato sticks and a sunny side up egg...omg the yolk added the perfect creamy element. I'm drooling now. Confit goat belly - Again, I would never think to top off goat with lobster and crab, but they did, and it works. Buttery, fresh, yum. The gamey flavor of goat is stronger than lamb, in my opinion, but it wasn't too overpowering. Milk chocolate and galangal napoleon - It was tangy (passionfruit), spicy (galangal, kind of like ginger). Add in some rhubarb. Nice was to end a meal. Not too heavy. Sticky date cake with blueberry preserves - I'm not a huge fan of dates. I thought this was a little sweet. The cake was moist. My parents enjoyed it. Our bill with food, 3 cocktails, and tip came out to be just over $200 for 4 people. I think that is very reasonable for the quality and creativity of food that you are getting. I actually expected it to be a little bit more, but was pleasantly surprised. I want to go to Chicago again just to eat here!!"
"As a frequent visitor to the Chicago area, I have learned to love this place and we aim to Â  Â get here at least once per visit. Â I have meant to review for a long time. Â The food is always spectacular. Â I try to order things that are outside my comfort zone and am frequently surprised by how wonderful they are. We always order many dishes and circulate around the table. Â The food is fresh and expertly prepared. Â They accommodate large parties and have always had a friendly wait staff. Â They have great wine and craft beer selection. Â Overall a nice farm to table, tapas style experience.If in Chicago, worth stopping by."
"We ordered the bread and honey/rosemary butter. No flavor at all. Fried pickles were like baby dill pickles paired with horrible sauces again with no flavor. The ham frites were good but lemon tree in dg has better fries. The bartender said they were the ""Best. Fries. Ever."" Worst of all was the mussels. Smelled like the monkey habitat at the zoo. Tasted to what I would imagine the monkey habitat at the zoo tasting like. We planned to try the goat or lamb but were disgusted with the appetizers. See ya never."
"Wonderful experience. Â Hostess was great, I just love when they commit you to memory and then recall your name an hour later, amazing. Â Food was wonderful, my favorite two dishes were the halibut and pig face. Â These were certainly dishes I could not recreate, the sear on them was perfect."
"So, does G & TG need another glowing review? Well, maybe. I mean, Chicago has a plethora of amazing restaurants and sometimes even the good die young. So I thought I'd take a moment to tell you: believe the hype. I say this a few weeks after finally dining at RPM, a place that I'd read nothing but outstanding things about, yet ended up rather underwhelmed. They change the menu frequently from what I understand, so no need to detail what we had. All I can say is that it was all solid. It doesn't hurt that I am a huge Top Chef fan. But there is nothing gimmicky here. In fact, I didn't see a single mention of Izzard's win. All in all, a great place, lovely and comfortable atmosphere and a 5 star joint in my opinion."
This place was amazing from start to finish. Service was great and friendly. Everything we ordered was recommended on yelp and every dish that came out tasted great! I would definitely come back.
"My friend and I had been wanting to try girl & the goat on several trips to Chicago and never made it. It was worth the wait! It was very busy the night we went and did not have reservations, so we sat at the bar. Our bartender was great. She made several good wine recommendations and helped us navigate the menu. While the restaurant is all about the goat, the vegetable dishes are exceptional!! The roasted cauliflower and wood grilled broccoli were some of the best dishes I have ever eaten. The portions are huge. We probably over-ordered since we also each got a meat dish. We learned too late that you can ask for smaller veggie portiions. Next time we'll likely order a bunch of smaller plates of vegetables and share. We also had the oysters to begin our meal. They were fresh and succulent.The only downside is the place is gets very noisy. But we will go back!!"
"Had dinner here for our 19th anniversary & it was the best meal I've had in Chicago since moving here more than 4 years ago. I tried several items that I've never had before & I was positively bowled over! Baby octopus, escargot ravioli, & goat belly were the new things I tried in addition to beef short ribs & scallops. I find myself thinking of the goat belly as my favorite--goat belly w/lobster & crab in a bourbon butter....I seriously considered licking my plate but held back. Dessert was a divine chocolate cake w/toffee & caramel gelato along with an order of goat cheese topped off with espresso. I will definitely be returning to this fine restaurant. Loved every minute."
"I'd say about a 3.5.Went here tonight with my dinner club. Â  We made reservations for a party of 8 via Open Table and only booked 3 weeks in advance. Â Not sure how we snagged a table with that short of a notice for this large of a party - but we did. Â It was a 6pm reservation on a Saturday.Service is really great here. Â Friendly, fun, knowledgeable, helpful. Â Very attentive, but not pushy or hovering. Â  They suggested approx 2 plates per person, but we went with 3, along with an order of each of the 3 breads on the menu. Â Probably too much food, but we plowed through most of it. Â In saying that, we did have an assortment of dishes. Â  Everything was good. Â Some plates were great, some were average. Â Nothing was bad. Â  I think some of the highlights were the chickpeas, broccoli, braised beef tongue, and trout. Â  The goat empanadas were good as was the goat liver pate (not everyone in the group liked this though). Â  The depth of flavor on the dishes was really enjoyable.The one negative I will comment on is the noise level. Â It is so very loud that you cannot here the people at your table talking. I think that maybe I'm giving it 3 stars because it is so overly hyped that I expected to be amazed beyond belief, and it was just good. Â  Â I am happy to say that I ate here, but probably wouldn't go back. Â I do think it is a bit over priced.Also, I did want to mention that we did not feel rushed at all. Â  The dishes came out in a slow fashion, so we had the ability to enjoy each, without things piling up."
"Throwing a few more bleatin' stars on the spit here, kids. Bahhhhh with me, ok? Not one to ever think much of making reservations, one fell from the sky for me on this particularly lovely Monday... and I took it as a sign that we should indeed make a return trip to Girl and the Goat. This was my first experience at G&tG that was a bit more intimate. Just me and my favorite date...and it made for quite the enjoyable experience. I never had less than stellar experiences in large groups either, this was just a different spin...and I quite enjoyed. First off, the Crispy Goat Neck (as my mobile tip implies) is...a revelation on the ""specials"" menu. Worth every penny of $32, it's quite possibly some of the best meat I've ever had the pleasure of indulging in. You'll need to get it. It's massive, it's delicious, and it's different. Try it. As a starter we opted for the onion bread. I gained 2lbs looking at the dense creation that lie before me. It's incredibly good, the bread baked fresh and moist. Unreal. And a large portion for $4. I didn't want to fill up on bread, but if the onion bread was all I could eat forever and a day, I wouldn't complain. Vegetables: Brocolli, Cauliflower & Peppers. Ridiculous. Vegetables are not meant to be this sexy, please stop! Everyone will be so healthy! No, they won't...cause these babies were doused in bleu cheese, swimming in crusted something-or-other awesome, and drenched in hearty flavor. These aren't how vegetables were intended to be...or were they? I think they were. We also ordered the pork shank, but definitely didn't need to. We had way more than enough food with the onion bread, 3 veggies and the goat neck. You've been warned...all the dishes are good portions and VERY filling. Ain't no weaklings in the bunch. We did bring everything home. The service, per usual was a dream. Everyone so on top of everything, seemingly moving in perfect sync without it appearing too forced or hurried. An art form, surely. Tony was our server and he was ever present but never hovering. Everyone that approached our table was confident, polite and A+. With no room for dessert I settled on a fresh brewed coffee to decompress...mmmmm. I mean really, they think of everything here. A beat is not missed. A misstep there is not. I eat at a lot of restaurants, all over the place, and Girl and the Goat has got this thing down to a science....everyone there seems happy to be there, staff and guests alike. Get the goat neck. *Valet = $10. Easiest option in this 'hood, though if you really want to hoof it, check Washington for meters. Randolph is always a mess."
"Like Amy M. said, What can I say that 2500 people haven't already? Hands down the best place I have ever had. My super picky boyfriend also agrees!"
"We luckily walked in right when they opened without having a reservation. Â We were seated at a table with others, which was fine since I expected to be turned away. There were three of us and we were told to order 3 plates per since they were small. Â They weren't that small. Â Waayyy too much. Â The broccoli was the favorite. Â Scallops were very tasty as was the salmon. Â The ham frites were mediocre and even more salty than expected (even for pork). Â The duck was good, though not quite worth the $20.00 price. Â The wine pours seemed stingy compared to other places recently visited (Beatrix, Balena). Â We were too full for desert, but an hour later we were dying of thirst due to the high salt in some of the dishes.We enjoyed the cool atmosphere and the staff was very good. Â Not quite up to the 5-star hype for me though. Â Would return after trying some other new places."
"I live in DC and we had a private dinner in the G&G wine cellar last night as a corporate dinner. Â I have had the pleasure of eating in the main dining room prior to our event last night. There is not a bad dish and it's very apparent that the culture of hospitality trickles from top down. Â Every dish was complex without prevention and our server, Brennan was absolutely incredible. Â You have to have service that matches the quality of the cuisine to make a perfect experience, and that's what happened last night!"
"Amazing. The food and service were outstanding. We had some challenging allergies at our table and the staff went above and beyond to identify which dishes were allowed, which could be slightly modified, and which were fine as is. I really loved every. single. thing. i. ate. Go and enjoy! Should be on everyone's culinary bucket list."
"Excellent experience from beginning to end. We were seated ahead of schedule which was a welcome surprise. The server was very helpful in suggesting how many small plates to order and she was spot on. I loved the food, with the highlights being the broccoli and the pig's face. The service was truly a well-oiled machine as well. This place would be a nice annual or bi-annual experience"
"I get the hype. I got reservations here for my mom, my sister and me months ago, and we have been looking forward to it. Girl & the Goat delivered. To start, I have to say that service was outstanding from start to finish. We ordered everything at once and our server helped put everything in order so it was paired well. Everything came at the perfect time, and she made sure we always had what we needed without being over-attentive. Their support staff, which helped run food and clear plates was always mindful of where we were in our meal and never touched our plates without asking if they could take them first which is a rarity at some places, so it was noticed and appreciated. We ate a ton, and it was all fabulous though I definitely favored some over others. We had:Bread: -White bread with corn, served with a goat cheese butter and a corn salsa. Sooo good. Veggies:-sauteed green beans in fish sauce- outstanding. -roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers and pine nuts- my favorite of the evening-quinoa ravioli with black currents and grape tomatoes- very good, but not one of my favorites.Fish:-squash blossom Rangoon- Amazing. another favorite of the eveningMeat:Wood-oven-roasted pig face served with a sunny-side egg. Salty and delicious and just enough. Quail with roasted watermelon. ok. Definitely my least favorite of the nightSmoked Goat Empanadas- Very good with a little bite. I enjoyed these a lot. For dessert, we had the Chocolate Magic Shell which was light and refreshing, and Zucchini cake which I really enjoyed and would recommend to anyone who doesn't really have a sweet tooth. All around, this meal was fantastic, lived up to the hype and was reasonably priced. I would return in a heartbeat. It was one of the better meals I've had in a really long time."
"I was really excited to visit this restaurant. I live in Los Angeles and i have yet to experience Pig Face there, so I was eager to go.First I have to say the service was amazing. I sat at the bar with a friend and we were never rushed, even though it was Saturday night, we were very well taken care of, refills, new forks and knives, awesome. The server was lovely, knowledgable and kind. The reason why I give the restaurant two stars is the food. Â I don't know if it was an off night, but every dish I had was just overdone. Too many flavors, too much fussiness. Too salty, Too sweet. Too fatty. The pork ribs were more like pork fat ribs. I am down for some fat, but Â lemme know that is what I am getting. There was Â fruit on it and when they brought the dish they said something about a yogurt sauce of something or other. No where to be found.The beet salad was really great, but then there was Â a little bit of something that just did not go. So it was delicious and then it was not delicious. The desert I was super excited about was a butterscotch pudding with creme and then I am not kidding 7 other items. The pudding was amazing! But then there was cake on it? And that was not on the menu, and some kind of a pineapple? Some kind of butterscotch nibs, and nuts and oy..I think there was something else on there too...Too much. If they stuck with the pudding and cream, it would have been perfect.I am not a master chef. I am not a food critic. I just love good food.I was super surprised to not dig this place.Sorry to post this , but feel its important to let people know.Go for drinks maybe some appetizers and eat at the bar. They are super nice there and you don't need a reservation. Show up you will get a spot even when it is busy."
This was the worst dining experience we have ever had at any restaurant we have ever been. In fact this is my first bad review I have ever written. However since this is one of the best restaurants in the country I had to weigh in. This does not compare to Alinea or True or Acadia or spiaggia or topolabamba or schwa or or any great restaurant I have ever been. Run don't walk from this business. Don't waste your time trying to get in. No customer deserves this treatment no matter how good the food may be. We arrived at 545 on a Saturday evening and were seated promptly next to the window. It was a cold evening and the window seat was really really cold and uncomfortable. Our waiter came and very abruptly explained that we must order everything at once. He talked us out of ordering more and then did not have the time or energy to explain anything to us at all. We were rushed from the beginning. We had dishes with different sauces and were never offered new plates in spite of mine at one point swimming in so much sauce from the green beans there would be no way of tasting another dish. We repeatedly asked for plates. Had to ask for more cocktails. At one point we requested three times that out table be wiped and nobody ever did. Â We were missing forks and knives. The dishes were oily and salty. Bread dish very similar to kfc biscuits. After all our food came we asked to see the menu again. Our waiter was so annoyed he reprimanded us rudely. He told us again that we were supposed to order everything at once even though we were hoping to try another goat dish he basically stomped off telling us he was afraid of what he may say To us. He had Â a lot of rage. Never in my life in the many countries and restaurants we have been around the world experienced anything remotely like this. Awful just awful. Table 71. Not good. First and only bad experience in 20 years of fine dining in chicago. Don't let people tell you what to think. Go in there with an open mind. You won't go back.
"We are from LA and make a point to eat at The Girl and The Goat whenever we come to Chicago. Stand out menu items are the goat empanadas, pork shank and apple buckle for dessert. (I wasn't blown away by the chick pea fritters or the Nantucket scallops.) The cocktails are AWESOME! The wine list is nice, but the ""by the glass pour"" is probably closer to 4oz than a standard 5-6oz pour. Overall it's a great restaurant with beautiful architecture, delicious food, reasonable prices for what you get, and we will be back. My biggest complaint this last visit was the service: I felt rushed. We were given no time to enjoy our cocktails before the waitress kept asking if we were ready to order. She insisted we should order everything at once (even though we wanted to start by just ordering an appetizer). The food came out way too fast. And she gave us dessert menus when we were only halfway thru eating our entree!! At that point, I directly told her that I was feeling rushed and she backed off... Meaning, she let us finish our entrees before she tried to get us to order dessert, and we fully enjoyed a coffee/ dessert course. Thank goodness she didn't drop the check until we were actually done eating. To be clear, she was never overtly rude, in fact, she was friendly and knowledgable, but I felt like I was eating at a diner, and she was trying to turn the table as fast as she could - instead of tuning into the fact that we wanted to enjoy our drinks and meal at a ""fine dining pace.""Otherwise, it was a good experience. The hostess staff was nice. The bus boy rocked - he didn't miss a beat re-filling water and clearing dirty plates. The food is unique and although it can be a little hit or miss, most of the items we've tried over the 3 times we've eaten there have been fabulous."
"A few weeks ago, a special occasion was somehow removed from my conscious memory and I was in a bind as to how to fix it. Â Luckily, I had a trump card in my back pocket and was able to procure Friday night reservations for this place three days before. Â Boom.No need to write about the food and drinks since it all has previously been written, and better I might add, by YelpLand. Â I do want to say the pre-dinner drinks we had at the bar were outstanding.The food was The Realness. Â The good - everything The bad - only when I spilled water on the seat. My bad Stephanie!Thanks for saving my ass, people of the Goat!"
"There is so much I love about this place. Food is amazing, naked cowboys are crack. Wait when you have a reso and wait just to get that reso completely suck tho. Over all, worth the wait."
"I was definitely hesitant when I looked into the menu for this place, but when traveling for work I'll try anything! Pig face, duck tongue, escargot ravioli? Very odd selection, but I tried them all and they were AMAZING. Our table of six ordered about a dozen or so dishes to split, and I'm so glad we did- everything was delicious. Our server was very helpful in suggesting and explaining the menu, and very diligent about stopping back to see how we were doing. Hands down, my favorite item though was not the pig face (like everyone else raves about), but the goat empanadas topped with tzatziki sauce- perfect flavor combination!!"
"We ate at so many great establishments in Chicago and Girl & The Goat was one of the best dining experiences we had. Â The staff is super friendly and knows everything there is to know about the menu. Â The food is daring, adventurous, and so freakin good. Â Nice to see Izard putting in work in the kitchen, too.Truly an unforgettable place."
"This place was just outstanding! I can't wait to go back again. I recommend you share things with the people your with so you can try everything. Everything that you see on the menu is absolutely outstanding, so don't be nervous of what you decide to get! I got lots of dishes. A lot!Here are all of the dishes:Gouda bacon bread - (very good. Great romesco sauce. Make sure to dip in that!)escargot ravioli - (very rich, and buttery. This dish is awesome!! )Pan fried Florida frog legs - (pretty epic. Really tender meat. )Duck tounges - (very crispy, awesome flavor).Lamb stuffed calamari (awesome. Great spice to it.)Oysters - fried naked cowboy and wood fired well fleet. Definitely wood fired well fleet were better. I would go for these again!! Amazing.)Wood oven roasted pig face - (AWESOME. Probably the best dish of the night)Roasted beets - (beet salad, GREAT starter. One of my favorite dishes)SautÃ©ed green beans - (great flavor to them)Hope this help to all of those out there! Definitely, definitely a go again!!"
"This is on the list of this year's awe-inspiring meals. Creative, not-too over the top- and flavor focused! Everything was very composed. Top Chef winner STEPHANIE IZARD was the expo for the evening!I did not make reservations, but ponied up to the bar when the restaurant opened. Our bartender was fantastic, knowledgeable and really enthusiastic about our being so open to suggestion. We were taken on a nice dining journey, from light to heavy:1-Pinn Oaks Lamb Tartare, English pea tapenade, tuna aioli and water crackers. The water crackers were wonderful- like eating the best flaky pie dough pulled into thin, yet substantial tartare trays.2-Squash blossom rangoon, crab, chive, yogurt and toasted almonds. Dreamy, creamy.3-Grilled baby octopus, guanciale, favas, radish-pistachio lemon vinagrette. This preparation rightfully knocked the Mario Batali- Babbo/ B&B Restaurante Octopus off the top of the best octopus list. 4-Braised beef tongue, masa, beef vinaigrette, salsa verde- this cam with some really nice vegetation as well- frisee and pickled onion. Yum.5-Quinoa ravioli- summer squash, grape tomato, huge black currants and a lovely olive crunch. This was kindly offered to us by our bartender and made me almost forget the last entree-the goat6-Confit of goat belly, Bourbon butter, lobster -n-crab, fennel. If you eat only one thing at G&G, eat this. This would be on my last meals list.7- goat cheesecake, hazlenut crunch, candied beets, cajeta. A light-weight ending to our robust dinner.Many thanks to the bartender for taking us on a delicious journey!"
"Went into G&G without a reservation at 5 PM and were miraculously given a table! The fennel and blue cheese bread was probably the best savory bread I've ever had! Now...as a vegetarian I appreciated all of the options that were available, but some if the courses we got just felt like a bowl of vegetables with some interesting seasoning. Case in point: wood grilled broccoli and roasted cauliflower. Not bad, but not amazing. The chickpea fritters were excellent! Squash wontons...meh. The meh is more out of my personal preference to not eat small creepy mushrooms. The taste wasn't bad. For dessert- the Apple buckle was perfect! I would go back again, but hopefully they have more substantial vegetarian options in the future!"
"Great ambiance, fantastic dining and impeccable service!! One of our favorite places, we especially like the variety in their menu. All their goat dishes are fantastic and their oyster and bread appetizer are phenomenal!!! Even though we don't eat pork the menu definitely has plenty of variety to satisfy every palette"
"Met a GF for a 4:30 dinner because that was the best she could get although it was 2 months in advance.. Â So it's natural to say that I had high expectations for the G&G..Well, it didn't disappoint.First off, our server was AMAZING, probably the best I've ever encountered at a restaurant.. Â Wish I knew her name, but she was the attractive brunette... Â She knew the menu inside & out, and really took her time explaining it and making recommendations. Â She also mentioned that she will time the dishes so that we can eat at a slow steady pace.. Â And she did just that..Wine & water was refilled promptly..We ordered 4 dishes..The pig face.Green beens.The pasta.Fish.Sorry folks, but I don't recall the names of the exact dishes.Everything was interesting and had a unique flavor of it's own. Â I was a little scared of the pig face, but by the time it lands on the plate, it's so dismantled that it looks like a piece of burnt sausage. Â Mixed with a fried egg and runny yolk, the dish was rather yummy..My favorite were the green beans with the white creamy sauce.. Â We munched on these for hours. Â Such a generous portion!Pasta was a filler.. Â Sorry but I don't really remember much about it.And the white fish was superb.. Â Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.By the time our dinner ended, G&G was P.A.C.K.E.D... Â It's a lovely atmosphere and a place to definitely check out..If you can get reservations, that is :)"
"Got an 11PM reservation. It was still packed. I was super tired, but really enjoyed the food. The portions were pretty decent. Service was great. We over ordered, but since the waiter didn't put in our entree order yet, he was willing to take it off for us. He knew we were getting full. Shishito Peppers-love these, but after awhile I couldn't eat any more. I think it was the cheese.Roasted Cauliflower-needed my veges. It was goodSquash Blossom Rangoon-Stuffed with crab. It was delish. Wood Fire Chicken-Lots of flavor and moist. Most places can't make a juicy chicken."
"Snagged TEN PM reservations (trust me, this is a score!) three weeks in advance. Â We pre-gamed at where else--Little Goat right down the street and with visions of the huge rotating glowing goat in my head, we were ready to take on Girl & The Goat! Â Noisy and full to the brim, this is not your intimate date place. Â This is where you grab a bunch of your best buds and try to order the entire menu. Â We got:- roasted cauliflower - as good as the reviews say!- kohlrabi salad - escargot ravioli - skate wing- wood oven roasted pig face - **floored the picky eater at the table--a MUST GET- goat empanadas - oysters Everything was tasty but the caulifower and the pig face were the winners of the table. Â The service was slightly forgetful and one of our party didn't get his cocktail til nearly the last dish. Â But there are lots of interesting and creative dishes and the bill was completely reasonable which is a total plus. Â In short, girl & the goat is great!"
"This is one of my favorite restaurant in Chicago, maybe even the country. I have eaten at Alinea and Next, but I have to say the Girl & the Goat is up there as well. While the dining style differs from Alinea or Next, Girl & the Goat offers good delicious food that is relatively in expensive compared to the other two. They seem to focus on good, delicious flavor combinations and not so much on Avant-garde presentations. The Service:The service is excellent. Everyone is attentive and quite friendly. Drinks are promptly refilled and plates are occasionally replaced. I like how the dishes seem to come out Â properly timed with some type of progression from light to heavier dishes. It is tapas style dining and dishes come out in waves as to not overwhelm you. The servers are great about taking finished dishes and replaced plates with new ones. Overall great service.The Food:The food is AMAZING. This was my second time dining here. The first time was just as great, but I failed to complete my review. I honestly wanted to write an awesome review, but ended up waiting too long and couldn't recall everything I wanted to say. Therefore, I am glad I got this second opportunity to write this review. This particular time we ordered:Pretzel Bread (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦)-- Served with Honey Mustard Butter and 1000 Island. Very Original!Goat Carpaccio (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦) -- It is what you'd expect. Tasty!Pan Fried Shishito Peppers (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦) -- Delicious. A little spice went will with the miso and cheese.Royal Red Shrimp Ceviche (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦) - Fresh, Perfectly tender and well seasoned!Smoked Goat Rillette Empanadas -- Warm and Crispy went well with the hummus!Wood Grilled Broccoli (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦) -- Served with Blue Cheese and Crisped Rice. Nice smoked falvor.Escargot Ravioli (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦) -- Interesting. First time I had escargot. My least favorite, but not bad.Diver Scallops - Yum! served with braised duck and green papaya.Confit Goat Belly (yelp.com/biz_photos/qjnpâ¦) -- Amazing! Very Lavish. Confit Goat belly topped with chunks of Crab, Lobster, and plenty of Bourbon butter.Pig Face (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦) -- One of my favorite dishes. Topped with egg, tamarind and cilantro. A nice crisp with a wonderful combination of flavors.Pork Shank (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦)-- Super tender. Falls off the bone. Served with spring onions and kim chi buttermilk. Red Tea Brulee (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦) -- A nice play on Creme bruleeQuatro Leches (yelp.com/user_local_photâ¦) -- A perfect combination of moist cake and berries. Not too sweet. Great way to end the meal.I definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting or in the Chicago area. Reservations are difficult. Usually need to be made months in advance, but well worth it!"
"Goatees are out of fashion. Â Not that anyone in their right mind should take fashion advice from me. Â If it weren't for a sensible wife to keep me in check, I'm sure I'd be rocking some Zubaz as formal wear, or at least business casual in as much of an un-ironic posture as possible. Â Them things are comfy- don't hate!psbblog.com/zubaz.jpgLast night upon entering G&tG, I was ready to focus on two specific menu items that wowed me from past visits: the green beans and the cauliflower. Â Two reasons that have led me to believe that Ms. Izard (unlike ""Zubaz"" her name only has one ""Z"") is worthy of all of the hype around her and her fine (though very loud) restaurant. Â To take rather simple ingredients, cook them masterfully, and get THAT amount of flavor to work in unison is enough for me to forget that I just dropped nearly $20 on a portion size that leaves me wondering when the meal is about to start.But never mind that for now. Â Because as usual- those dishes were great (though comparing them side-by-side, the green beans are favored). Â What I came here to talk about is the house beer. Â A Belgian Strong Ale (around 8.0% ABV) by the name of Girl and the Goatee. Â At $6 a pour, properly served up in a traditional chalice, this is maybe the best value in the place, and very much in-fashion. Â By nights end, I believe all five drinkers at the table had this drink in front of them. Â It was so remarkable that even sitting in my office now, I'm dreaming of having one...Perhaps I have a problem.Next time I'm faced with wanting to get a great quality beer in the area, I'd have to go against logic to head to Haymarket Brewery, and will probably find myself at the bar here for a Girl and the Goatee. Â And some green beans. Â And maybe even some cauliflower.*Notable dishes also tried: the scallops, the quail (maybe the top dish of the evening), and the pork shank is a great way to try out what the pre-ordered goat leg is like (served up with the same breads and spreads as the goat)."
"Girl & the Goat embodies everything every restaurant should strive for: bold flavors, perfect execution, and creativity to the utmost degree. What more can I say that 529 5-star reviews haven't touched on already? Chef Stephanie Izard is a flippin' genius (and so incredibly down-to-earth, I must add! Met her once at a small gathering after her Top Chef win and she was super personable). Love the ambiance, but love the food even more! It's nice that they're all small plates so you can share and try everything. Raw Penn Cove oysters are a must, as well as the goat carpaccio. Goat rilette empanadas are addictive... I wish I could eat one for breakfast every day. Can't go wrong with goat belly, and the lamb's heart dish isn't just one that you should order for novelty's sake... It's actually DELICIOUS. Basically, order as much as you can afford because every dish is unique and is guaranteed to make those taste buds dance! Don't forget about dessert, either! She thinks everything through: flavor, texture, aroma, temperature... Fabulous. I can officially die happy."
"People are not lying. This place is amazing! We had a late dinner reservation on Saturday night, and I love walking into a restaurant that is lively with a good energy, we got exactly that at Girl and the Goat!We split 4 dishes and a bottle of wine and were stuffed walking out. Here is what we had:1. Whitefish - the sauce was amazing with fingerling potatoes and crisps. We received a nice size of fish and it was cooked absolutely to perfection. The sauce was a great accompaniment to the dish and I kept scooping more and more on top of the fish! 2. Scallops - Two large scallops, once again cooked perfectly, with fried brussel sprouts (love), pecans and pomegranate seeds. The pomegranate seeds worked SO well with the scallops. I was obsessed. 3. Roasted Cauliflower - Probs my favorite dish of the evening. It looked like it was roasted over an open flame as it had nice char to it and the peppers worked so well with the cauliflower. I loved this dish, its a must have!!4. Pigs Face - Yep, it was the richest dish of the evening served last. Crispy potatoes, pigs face and an egg served on top. It was amaze! Very rich and well balanced. I cant wait to go back and try more off the menu. I've heard their breads are amazing as is their pork shank. We were actually going to order it and our waiter suggested we hold off since the 4 dishes we ordered were larger portions. Great suggestion as we were stuffed after our fourth. He was very attentive and kept our wine glasses refilled all evening. Great experience top to bottom!"
"I visited this place a few months ago but finally got to reviewing it. So through some divine intervention (AKA some friends having the right kind of connections) I got a reservation at Girl and the Goat within 24 hours. And even if I had to wait a few months I would definitely come here.It's loud, it's dark, the decor is cool, the service is friendly, the food was fantastic...oh my god. The food. I usually don't eat a lot of meat, but I made an exception here. The pig face was phenomenal. I distinctly remember there was a cauliflower dish that blew my mind. The chickpeas dish was perfect. I did the gross hipster thing and took photos of each dish because I wanted to remember every single detail. I was slightly underwhelmed by the green beans, but that's probably because I am basically an old woman and I like my green beans mushy and flavorless (I'm gross, I know). I'm coming back for you, girl and the goat. Wait for me."
"Worth the hype. We were able to get a two seat reservation a day before and lets just say I was stoked. Â Service was very attentive and charismatic. We sat down and ordered a rose grenacha (a bit light but refreshing from the Chicago heat) Â and a cucumber collins (my friend was in love with the refreshing cucumber and primrose taste - everything she ever wanted in a cocktail) Food: Mr Potato Bread- homemade fresh from oven potato bread with two different butter flavors. Both were amazingRoasted beet salad- frisee and beets mixed with a creamy avocado dressing and green beans. This was good but very simple and nothing mind blowing Roasted Cauliflower - pickled peppers, pine nuts and mint. The dish was very hearty and meaty rich flavorRed ceviche - hands down some of the best ceviche I've ever had (gives Limon a run for their money). The shrimp was perfectly raw, slightly lemony, fresh, pink, sweet and amazing on top of a cute little thin cheese cracker. Amazing! Crisp braised pork shank - WOW!!! the meat was falling off of the bone and with simple pull from a small fork fell right off - I mean right off the bone. Served with a kimchee reduction sauce - tasted like kimchee soup but reduced to highlight the strong flavors, a cute little side of spring onion kimchee, and buttermilk dressing and small chewy mini na'an's. We filled the na'an with the amazing pork that still had crunchy bits of fat on the outside. Drizzled on some kimchee sauce, spring onions and buttermillk. I don't think we talk through that whole meal. Overall a must if you're visiting Chicago. The place is very busy post-work hours and can get a bit loud but the food and experience is worth it!"
Great service and great experience!!! Â Food was awesome! Â At the beginning I saw the menu I kinda wanted to leave but instead I trusted the waiter with all his suggestions and he was right on!!! Â Glad I stayed!!!
"Holy hell, this was an amazing dining experience! We went there when it first opened. We were seated outside in one their communal tables. We were orientated on how things work by Danielle. We ordered the wood fire oysters, the beet salad, the duck breast, the pig face and goat belly. good, Good, GOod, GOOd, GOOD!!! The oysters were simple, savory and tangy at the same time. The beet salad was fresh and delicious. The pig face was AMAZING! I never thought that egg and pork tasted sooo good. So soft, salty and savory with a consistent touch of citrus across all their dishes. The goat belly with lobster and fennel was GREAT! The duck...That damn duck! If the bill and web feet were, we would have eaten that, too! Since we were on a roll, we went with a blue cheese with a rosemary honey and their budino. The honey was soooo amazing with the cheese. And the budino was the best dessert I've ever had. When the check came, I was surprised and the price the experience we had. An amazing dining experience that deserves an encore! Great job, Stephanie Izzard!!!"
"This restaurant blows me away. The creative combination of flavors and the careful details to texture gives this restaurant a big thumbs up. The ambiance is great - open kitchen, trippy paintings, witty staff, fast service.Roasted Cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint - the combination sounds a bit different, but the flavors and the textures go so well together. It was different, but in a very very very good way.Sauteed Green Beans with fish sauce vinaigrette and cashew - again, I probably never would have thought of this combination... and AGAIN, I'm completely pleased. The fried shallots added the winning touch here ;)Sauteed Cod Cheeks with maitake mushrooms, manquat and garlic crunch - I LOVE FISH CHEEKS and I was overjoyed when I saw cod cheeks on the menu. I have to admit, the garlic crunch was so fun and tastyWood Oven Roasted Pig Face with sunny side up, tamarind, cliantro and potato stix - don't be taken aback by the name of this dish. It's face meat ground up and shaped into a patty... you won't be getting a pig head on a plate. Crispy on the outside, juicy, fatty, and tender on the inside, paired with a sweet and sour tamarind sauce and the perfect drizzle of cilantro sauce to contrast the tamarind, and again, perfect pairing of crunch texture with the potato stix. This was by far my favorite plate I had during my trip to Chicago. I can't wait to go back."
"absolutely fantastic. I greatly admire Stephanie Izard for her hard working spirit and for proving that she deserves the title of the only female winner of a Top Chef competition. our dinner was divine! servings are small; between two of us, we ordered-chickpea fritters: good but not crazy about it-soft shell crab tempura-diver scallops-escargot ravioli-goat belly confit with lobster & crab (MUST order at least one goat dish!) -goat cheesecakeit was the perfect amount of food. we finished every last drop of sauceall of the dishes were so unique and flavorful and they were not heavy at all, as tapas sometimes tend to be. the sauces were well crafted, and the accompanying sides to the dishes complemented perfectly!!! reservations are recommended! this place was packed at 9pm on a Monday. service is fantastic, prices a little steep but definitely worth a visit for a special occasion or a just because you deserve it type deal :]"
"Best. Birthday. Ever. Â  My best friend treated me to a G&G dinner for my birthday this year. Â Girl & the Goat had been on my ""to try"" list forever and it did not disappoint. Of course, we were completely unable to get a reservation, but we did have some luck just walking in. We got a table after about 1:15 of waiting. I know this might sound outrageous, but it was a Friday night in Chicago. It was totally worth it, and they did serve us cocktails while we stood in the foyer. Â An amazing cocktail, btw. I can't even tell you what was in it, scotch, cherry and orange according to the menu. It was delicious and potent! But on to the rest. The food. holy moly. I have absolutely no idea what I ultimately ate. There were foods and combinations of foods on my plate that I had never heard of. And the tastes were so completely unfamiliar, new, strange, and magical. Nothing tasted like anything I had ever eaten before, and everything was so profoundly delicious that it was all my friend and I could do to just mumble at each other while our eyes rolled back. the pig face was wondrous. Â Pork belly and goat belly, both divine. Even the bread was special. There was so much on the menu we wanted to try, but being only two people, we had to be conservative. :(. We did splurge on dessert. As it was my birthday, Girl & the Goat treated me with a second dessert, on the house! Both were spectacular. Like the rest of the food, dessert was totally interesting, full of weird and unusual flavors, not overly sweet, and amazing. I even got to blow out the candle on my cake. Thanks Girl & Goat for helping me do my birthday right!"
"I've been wanting to go here since it opened, but was never able to get a reservation on a convenient night or at a convenient time. I was finally able to make a reservation that met those criteria (3 months in advance) and made it here for dinner with my boyfriend for a special occasion. All I can say is, it was worth the wait!The restaurant is actually quite large and spacious. The tables are a little close together, but not as close as at some other places I've been. Considering the size of the place, I was expecting it to be quite loud, but it was manageable. My boyfriend and I didn't have to scream at each other to be heard--always a plus.Everything on the menu looked great, but we went with the waitress's suggestion of 2-3 plates per person and ended up getting green beans, beet salad, soft-shelled crab, frog legs, goat empanadas, and the quail as well as chocolate cake and cheesecake for dessert. Everything was delicious. I would say our least favorite dish was the frog legs but that was probably because neither of us had ever had them before and it just wasn't our favorite meat. I don't think it had anything to do with how they were prepared. As far as favorite dish goes, it was probably a tie between the goat empanadas, the quail, and the soft-shelled crab. All were superb. The desserts were great as well. I think I preferred the cheesecake slightly because I didn't particularly care for the gelato that came with the chocolate cake. In short, we were extremely pleased with our meal here and would definitely come back. It's too bad that it's so difficult to get a reservation here, but at least it lives up to the hype."
"Booked reservation 3 months ago due to friends recommendation. Â Arrived on time and was seated promptly. The waitress indicated that the food was meant to be shared, Â I wanted to try the goat leg so she said we could get the last one, Â meanwhile it was only 5:30....hard to believe there was only one Left, Â I admit I had no clue what to expect. Â The waitress said get 8 to 10 other items,,,so we ordered the sting beans,cauliflower, duck tongue, pig face, escargot ravioli, fried pickles, chicken. Â Within minutes food was flying on our table. Â Pickles, escargot , and duck tongue .....these were just not my cup of tea....the duck tongue was so gamy I couldn't swallow it and had to spit it in my napkin. Next came the pig face which was a crunchy piece of fat. Then came the goat leg monstrosity. Â It weighed 8 lbs. Â there were 5 of us and we could not put a dent in it. Â It was good but wayyyyy to big. Â It should be recommended for 10 people or more, Â next came the string beans , cauliflower, and chicken.....vegetables were good, chicken was average. Â My gripe with this place, hence the 2 stars, is the waitress oversold us food. Â When we ordered the goat , I feel she should have guided us to just get vegetables with the goat. Â We had no clue a goat leg could be 8 lbs. it was obnoxious how much food came to our table that we couldn't eat. Â Also, the waitress should have told us the price of the leg,,,,,8lb goat leg is $200. Â I didn't like the menu choices although,,,,the food was good but once was enough.BEWARE of the goat leg!"
"I'd been trying to get a reservation here for quite some time. Even my 'connections' couldn't get me a solid reservation, just a couple tips on getting in. I have worked for a former TC contestant and have high respect for chef Izard. The restaurant was trendy but not stuffy. The lounge area was a little odd, I noticed a few people eating there and it seemed quite awkward to eat in that area. The place was PACKED and it was a Tuesday night, it was exactly what I expected and I was thankful it was a weeknight. After FINALLY getting seated (long long long wait, but expected) we were seated in the corner of the restaurant, which turned out to be incredibly hot. This was the worse part of the whole visit. The server was great, explained the concept of small plates, suggested 6-7 plates for me and my husband. We ordered sugo, green beans, pork shank, scallops, shisito peppers, fried pickles, and the housemade bread and butter. Everything was delicious! The sugo, green beans, and peppers were definitely the standout dishes of the night. And even my meat and potatoes loving husband enjoyed the vegan dishes as much as the meat dishes if not more. I would highly recommend this to anyone and especially vegetarians in the Chicagoland area. I can't wait to try Little Goat!"
"Girl and a Goat was a great dining experience but not a mind blowing one. Certain dishes were definitely awesome but others left me wondering. The goat ribs are awesome. Brussel sprouts, grapes, olives, and the goat is fall off the bone. The pig face was just as good. Meat, tamarind sauce, but I couldn't taste the cilantro oil or it just didn't come out with the tamarind. Â The fried egg was a nice touch as well. The cauliflower was interesting. I liked the mild heat from the chili peppers, but I'm still on the fence on the use of the vinegary fish sauce in the preparation. Â Not my favorite dish of the night. Service was awesome. There are quite a few families that come with their kids."
Waiting 2 months for a table was well worth it:)
"From the first bite on, it was no longer Girl & the Goat, it was Elaine & Goat. Let's rewind for a bit, the restaurant is booked on reservations months in advance, but definitely still give it a call in case there are some last minute spots opened up. But not all hope is lost, they also welcome walk-ins and wait it out. If you are dining with a small group, you can also find seating at the bar/lounge area where they will ask you if you would like to dine there instead of the main dining hall.The restaurant is huge and the kitchen is open to the main space (although I didn't see Stephanie Izzard inside :sad face:) All the staff gets rather busy, even the waiters run around busting tables.**Potato Bread: They don't give you free breadsticks or unlimited soup and salad like the average american restaurants, but guess what? They have a delicious reason why. Straight from the oven, their Potato Bread is to die for, it Â comes with a potato cream Â spread and also a garlic butter spread.**Diver Scallop: Yum-Azing!!!! Perfect texture with the perfect sear. If there's anything I have learned from cooking reality shows, it's that only a real chef that knows how to do a scallop right. The complimentary ingredients goes perfectly well with the sweetness of the scallop. Did I say 'perfect' already?**Shishito Pepper: I really good bowl of veggies to add to the table. The peppers has a little bit of spicy kick to it so it's good to wake up the appetite with one.**String Beans w/ Fish Sauce: OMG, the fish sauce and the nuts on top, this dish is addictive. You will keep popping those beans in your mouth. The fish sauce adds a little bit of tartness to the string beans. Another great plate to add a little bit of vegetable to your menu.**Escargot Ravioli: Must admit, I'm not an escargot kind of girl. But it sounded so interesting on the menu that I just had to try it. It was interesting for sure. Ravioli usually come with a soft filling, but the chewy escargot inside the ravioli gave it a different level of pasta experience. It's very hard to describe, but it was definitely worth trying.Wonderful dining experience and best meal in Chicago by far. I would love to return with every return visit to Chicago. Stephanie, when are you going to visit in San Francisco?!"
"Six girls, one goat. Yea, I guess it sounds a little dirty but I'm talking about a nicely slow cooked, fall off the bone, meaty, goat LEG. So get your mind out of the gutter! ;-)What else can I say that hasn't already been said. Nothing...except that the leg was the mother f'n BOMB!!!!! For those that don't understand that kind of lingo, lets just say it was tastier than your average home cooking. This place is definitely worth the trip and the money, so I would definitely recommend making reservations and ordering the leg dinner. Make sure you try more than one small plate and do like we did....order all the desserts so everyone can try them. Keep in mind that you can't walk in off the street and order the leg, you have to order it in advance for that exquisite flavor."
"Deliciously different! escargot raviolis, chick peas fritters, and the goat cheese gelato out of this world! The place to go to in Chicago! Went on a Monday night at 9pm and it was packed! Clean bathrooms and great service!"
"I had PIG FACE ... Really PIG FACE .... Awesome stuff. Â Celebrity chef, so I had concern, but this place is fantastic.Fantastic beers on tap as well.Highly recommend."
One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! I always go with a big group and we end up ordering one of everything. Which is perfect because it is like family style dining..everyone shares! Everything on the menu is fantastic! One thing is they will not seat you if your entire party isnt there. But they will show the people who are there to the bar area while you wait for the others. We had advanced reservation so dont expect to just walk in without one and get a table.
SOOOOOOOOOOOOO Good! We came here right after a Bears Game in September and got seated right away (lucky). Scallops were my favorite!
"Solid, solid food! Â  We had a great celebration meal recently, and loved the experience. Â The atmosphere is amazing and international feeling (as many of the ""it"" restaurants in Chicago tend to be). Â We were surrounded by German tourists, and I loved eavesdropping on the conversation while they navigated the wine list and small plates. Â The highlights of the meal were the escargot ravioli and the pig face. Â (Seriously - do it.) Â Yes, it's definitely EXPENSIVE, but Stephanie knows what she's doing! Â This is a place that I'll definitely check out again, and one that's perfect for that special occasion."
"Girl and the Goat is one of the true great restaurants of Chicago. Many dishes are excellent, and the rest are very good. They offer a smallish plate menu, so I think this place is best enjoyed in a group of four or more. I've been here about four times in the past two years, so my specifics will mostly be the standouts from memory:The Breads - a necessary order. Many different types of bread (such as brioche, sourdough) served with different butters and spreads (tomato, avocado). These breads and spreads change often, but we've always been satisfied by what we order.Green Beans - strangely enough, possibly my favorite dish at this restaurant, despite being a meat loving guy. These are perfectly crunchy, tangy, and the cashews complement the dish very well.Cauliflower - another huge hit. Nicely roasted, oily, cheesy, and the pine nuts are an excellent addition. I only tried them the first time because our nice waitress gave us an on-the-house order near the end of our meal. We've always ordered them since.Goat Liver Mousse - very rich, creamy, served with hot crumpets. Filling and very good.Sugo - one of my favorite dishes. Thick, very meaty sauce served on top of wide noodles and with gooseberries. Rich and heavy.Pig Face - sounds like a bit of a novelty, but really follows through as an excellent dish. Crispy, topped with an egg, potato sticks, and other tasty ingredients. Best enjoyed if mashed together. Crispy Duck Tongue - the tongues themselves were definitely crispy and the flavor was good, but not all that interesting.Pork Shank - delicious, though usually served at the end when everybody is pretty stuffed. The meat easily comes off the bone with a gentle push of your fork, and the accompanying red sauce (miso and fermented bean?) is truly outstanding.Scallops, Baby Octopus, Escargot Ravioli - I remember all of these dishes being quite good (especially the octopus), but because it's been a while, I'm unable to go into specifics.Service - excellent. Friendly, attentive. Drinks - a great wine selection. Beer selection is somewhat limited, especially the draft list. One of my friends had coffee at the end and found it to be unbelievably good.Miscellany - the website design is a little cluttered and confusing, which is hugely surprising given the excellent design at the sister restaurant, Little Goat.Overall, a great place with food that is almost consistently excellent. 5 stars."
"It's been years since I've been here, so I don't remember all of what we ate, other than that it was delicious. Our server was super helpful and personable and helped us pick the perfect dishes. I think I remember some spectacular green beans, a pig face, and some goat. All were tasty."
This restaurant is hands down my favorite in Chicago. Loved everything about it. Ambience is great and the food is to die for. We had the Chilean sea bass and it was superb. I could have ate three of those! The chickpea fritters and the brussel sprouts were also a must try. I wasn't a big fan of the Himachi or Trout. Cocktails were superb...I had so many that I don't remember the name. Enjoy!
"Worth the hype and the splurge.We tried at least eight different dishes and all of them were fantastic.Keep in mind the dishes are served in small plates, tapas style. If it is a party of two, order at least 4-5 items in the menu to share."
"Finally, after having tried a few times to get into this place on weekends i was able to make it in here on a sunday evening. i was prepared to come early and be the first few in line if i had to, fortunately i was able to get an outdoor seat immediately upon arrival(restaurant was pretty empty for about 15 mins and then people were having to get their name written down).Our server was with us also immediately with the menus and water and it took my wife and me a while to figure out what to order as we had been told to order at least 4-5 things from the menu to fill ourselves.We ordered beers for ourselves, i got an imperial IPA and my wife got a kolsch.We ordered the wheat bread, roasted cauliflower, kohlrabi salad, chickpea fritters and the chicken.The bread and its spreads were absolutely delicious and the warm bread melting the garlic butter just infused it with flavor.The roasted cauliflower was just like everyone had said it would be. it was full of flavor and crisp. the mint leaves and pickled onions gave it variety of flavors in the same bite.The chickpea fritters were good but the peppers were a little overcooked for me and were not as crisp as i would have liked them to be. the tangy sauce was also a bit disappointing.Chicken was done very well. the sauce and the asparagus tempura with it were very tasty. definitely a Japanese touch to it. the glaze of the sauce on the chicken was good too. However, the bone in the chicken made it very difficult to eat the chicken without using your hands and the chicken lacked flavor once you got past its outer skin.We stayed long enough to get ourselves one more beer each. we also got a dessert which was an ice cream with rhubarb pieces, milk chocolate and thin crisp brownies and i thought it was okay.It again had a tangy sauce in it which i did not like much.The price for the meal with tips came to about 120.I think the food is surely something unique and different but the meat section of the menu is very expensive and can be had as an entree alone and you do not need to order anything else.There is also a lot of flavor in the food and sometimes there is too much flavor in each bite(you get sweet, bitterness and sourness all in the same bite). That seems a little tricky to me and have to figure out to eat in places like these as i have frequented typical restaurants( thai, mexican, american, india etc.) only in my time in the US.I noticed that they had a great selection of wine but since i am not a wine drinker i completely avoided that side of the menu.Also, i would like to specifically note that the service is awesome and there is nothing more you can ask from your server at the end of the night.I probably will not return to this place again but do think the experience of eating food like this , which clearly draws inspiration from various cuisines is unique and should be experienced once at least."
"I made this reservation about 4 months in advance. Â It is very hard not to have the hype influence me when you hear such amazing things and see all the five star reviews. Â And frankly, when you wait 4 months for the meal, you expect taste-fireworks!The pig face is one of the most delicious dishes I have ever put into my mouth. Â Literally, one of the most memorable things i've ever ordered at a restaurant. Â Do not miss it! Â We ordered the roasted beets to cut through all the meaty dishes we ordered, but they were by far the least exciting dish of the bunch, so I say skip the veg. Â Just tell yourself you'll eat healthy again tomorrow. Â The escargot ravioli was completely unique, different from any dish I'd had before, so worth it just for that! Â I believe the specialty goat Â menu changes frequently; I think we had a goat shank with white beans, like a cassoulet almost, which likely isn't on the menu anymore. Â But it was fall off the bone tender and the beans had a toothsome texture instead of being mushy.Our server seemed to be in a bit of a daze, but food was so good it didn't matter. Â And the best part was that all of the food was unique. Â Aside from being delicious, everything tasted new, like who-woulda-thunk-it, that those food combinations would work together but they do!I'd love to go back anytime and try some new dishes - guess I'd better make that reservation NOW, huh?"
"Ordered all the goat dishes. Â Over hyped. Â Pig face was good. Â Shishito peppers too. Â goat liver - blandgoat belly - dry and too sweetgoat carpaccio - blandcrumpets were good.escargot ravioli was tough, and sauce tasted like wine.duck tongue - dry and batter tastelessfried clams like duck tonguessome other non memorable dishes.waited 40 minutes for a seat at the bar. Â i ate by myself, luckily at the communal table and i gave away the food. Â didn't want to waste it even though it wasn't so good.sorry i think i'm just spoiled growing up in San Francisco."
"Really enjoyed my dinner. Â So many great dishes - fried chickpeas, dumplings, skirt steak, goat belly, and goat empanadas. Â Server was very friendly and recommended a great wine. Don't be afraid to try the goat dishes -- they are some of the best. Bottom line? Â Amazing. Great food. Â Great service. Must go."
"Ok, so we came for the celebrity chef and the results were mixed. All around good flavors, one of the best and most generous beet salads I have ever had. Some other dishes were a miss, ie the goat belly confit that was plated very fancy (a departure from the other plates) and it had all these extra ingredients it didn't need (rubbery lobster). Service was not great, waitress forgot the drink order but that was ok, drinks cost as much as entrees and I'd rather have the entree. I was impressed it was packed at 9:00pm on a Wednesday, it was a very energetic atmosphere!"
"Loved it, loved it, loved it. Everything! The atmosphere, the food, the service. I won't bore you with details because 2000+ people have given details. The highlights for me:1. The Sea Bass (it's not actually listed as Sea Bass on the menu, I can't remember what it was called) is out of this world delicious. And I'm not generally a fish eater.2. The cauliflower - who knew it could taste so gosh darn delicious?3. The green beans - same as the cauliflower. Like, I actually dreamed about green beans last night.4. Pork shank - super tender, loved the naan that came with it, and the dipping sauces.I think a party of 4 is the ideal sized group to go with. We split each dish into four and it was perfect! Plus, we got to try so many different options, more-so than had we just been a party of 2.We ordered 7 different options, plus bread, a couple of drinks, and it was around $200. $250 with a generous tip. Service was spot on."
"A wonderful restaurant. It's got a really creative, refreshing menu and great cocktails. Our server was attentive, had great suggestions and was very funny to talk to. I'm visiting Chicago for about 20 days and have eaten a lot of fatty, ""pizza & steak"" type meals. This was a great relief from that. Keep in mind one thing. There were 3 of us and we didn't have a reservation. We had a choice between a wait of over an hour or immediate seating out on the big, sidewalk tables. The sidewalk was really nice. It was a great night and the street has very little traffic. The inside seemed really frenetic and noisy by comparison, so we felt we chose well. The pig face is great. It would be a shame to eat there and miss it. The octopus was amazing. The raw oysters, if you're into that sort of thing, are amazing because they serve them on the shell but with chilled, raw onion under the oyster ( i think. either way it was awesome. )This place is not cheap. Get ready to spend some money. Even with that in mind... 5 stars."
"I don't need to beat a dead horse (goat?) here by re-listing what everyone loves so much.Basically the food is very good and the atmosphere is fun. Â Girl and the Goat hit the timing just right with a very good combination of food and location to become the ""hot"" restaurant for several years running.The only problem is that with great success comes a certain amount of laziness... or just maybe it is just too busy for it's own good. Â You may feel a bit rushed and a but crammed while there (and make sure you make reservations three months ahead of time!).Still, despite a few flaws it is worth a visit or two and the food is inventive and interesting."
Yes get the pig face. Â Everything about the food has been said. Â Just a tip if it's on your restaurant to-go-to list: Â check the night of--I've gotten last minute reservations here at least twice this way.
We are from the So Cal area and we heard about this place. It was on our top list of things to do in Chicago. My husband and I were taken about all the infused favors in the food. We had the scallop with a brown kimchee sauce and charred pork belly It was all totally awesome! Green beans were infused with a fish sauce.. Awesome flavors!!! We love this place!!
"Easily one of my favorites in the city. It's difficult to get a table unless you reserve far in advance or are willing to eat really late, so fortunately, G&TG has a decent-sized bar/counter, too.If you get nothing else here, GET THE PIG FACE. Even if your dining partner is usually a burger person, he too will enjoy the pig face (trust me on this one). It doesn't look like much, and if I told you what it was, you would just go ""eh,"" but it is unlike anything you have ever eaten anywhere else, and you will practically be licking the plate before all is said and done. So smash that egg, mix everything up and EAT IT.Other must-haves: 1. Ham frites. It's listed under the meats, but yes, it is essentially french fries that have somehow been cooked with ham. I don't know how they do it, but the result is rather heavenly. Why has no one else done this before? Also, as if they weren't good enough already, they come with dipping sauces: tomato aioli and beer cheddar. Yes, beer cheddar. Both complement the salty frites perfectly.2. Roasted cauliflower. I wouldn't have thought to order this, but one of my doctors told me that even his kids liked it. When kids like cauliflower, you have to be intrigued, right? I won't say this dish didn't taste like cauliflower -- it did -- but somehow, it was REALLY good. The pine nuts, peppers, mint and parmesan complement the cruciferous vegetable in such a way that, again, you ask yourself why people don't always make it this way. Fabulous.Also good, but don't kill yourself over them:The blue prawns with peanut-pork ragout and spaghetti squash were fantastic -- perfectly meaty and briny. But I know how it is with shrimp: Either you really like it or you really don't. If you do, you'll love this.It's hard to say how you'll like the bread because they have three different ones every day, and some are far superior to others. If you're dining alone or with only one other person, you may want to skip the bread because the loaves are rather massive, and you don't want to fill up on it and miss all the nuances of the rest of the food. Moral of the story: Only get bread if you're in a group and only if the description sounds really, really good; otherwise, save your appetite.Love, love, love this place. When I am not in Chicago, I dream of it. Can't wait to go back."
"So good! This restaurant lives up to the hype. We were a little nervous when we arrived because even with a reservation we were told ""we will let you know when a table is available"" in a pretty snooty tone. We waited about 20 minutes and then were seated at arguably the worst table in the place, right next to the front door. Luckily for us things just got better and better from there. We ordered the goat empanadas and they were delicious. Tender meat, yummy dough they were delish. Next up was the ahi, again simply amazing, clean fresh flavors. We got adventurous with the next course and went with the duck tongues. We were all surprised by how delicious they were. I'm not sure the tongues really deserve any credit as the flavors of the rest of the dish is what stood out. Â Pig face and the pork shank finished the meal and they were both so good we almost licked the plate. Overall a great experience, wonderful food, a little iffy service and pretty loud but did I mention how good the food is?"
This place was great. We managed to get a spot at the bar as the wait was 1 hr 45 min for a table. Everything we ate was delicious. I highly recommend the oven roasted pigs face and the goat empanadas.
"Was second time there today. Well, this time dish selection didn't amazed me that much. Ordered 1).cauliflower - was ok, pretty saulty, nothing that special, will not order again2) Ribs - was ok, big portion (all of my friends were jelaous, cause their portions were really small), but again, was not flying to the sky from it - will not order again3) Desserts were really good. Ordered BD&J (or something like that) - was very good, liked it, worth ordering again."
"Make a reservation for 6 people (even if it's 2 months in advance because everything is booked), take the 9pm seating even if it's later than you want, reserve the goat leg dinner, ensure your dining partners are IN.Flash forward 2 months. You forgot that you have this much talked about goat leg Â dinner coming up. Â Within 1 week of dining, you've received confirmation of reservation from friendly GATG hostess and now you're re/reading recent reviews of GATG written by good Yelp friends. Â Get excited again. What I found was an extraordinary dining experience. Â Service from reservations to hostess to servers was wonderful and the food was just impeccable. Â If you can, order the goat leg dinner. Â You have to reserve/order it in weeks in advance, but it will knock your socks off. Let me break down our dinner.We started with some drinks at the bar and then moved to the table.The small plates:Cauliflower--roasted cauliflower with garlic, mint and bits of cheese. crunchy, hearty, veggie goodness.Chick Pea Fritters--chick peas in a tomatoe-y sauce, over the softest creamiest mozzarella I've ever had.Grilled Baby Octopus--with bacon, citrus, purple cabbage, onions. Â Delicate yet flavorful with a punch of bacon delight. Shisito peppers--roasted and done up with cheesy bits--another stellar choice. Then came the goat leg served on a butcher block platter. Â Ours was about 3-4 lbs of goat leg which I swear our server said is brined, then cured and then roasted. Â Whatever they did to it, it was fall off the bone tender. Â It was meaty, it was delicious. Â Served with 5 different sauces (Harissa, a Cilantro/Mint sauce, Shallot garlic and two others) and grilled pita bread to make little goat meat sammies. Â And if that doesn't sound good, add some of the frizzled onions or slices of hard boiled egg to your sammie. Trust me, it's delicious. I think I sighed in contentment at least a dozen times. A couple of folks at our table were hesitant, but I think they were won over by this delicious meal. Â (If you could have seen Theresa L sigh and put her head in her hands--I think she was won over!)We did get all four deserts to try as all--Red Tea creme brulee, a chocolate cake with raspberry gelato, a quatros leches cake with fresh blueberries , and a goat cheese cheesecake. They were all very good but my favorite was the creme brulee--I'm a sucker for a good brulee and this was so creamy with a nice hint of tea. Â The least favorite was the leches cake as it didn't have enough ""leches"" for us to think about a fabulously moist cake. The space is gorgeous. Â Sleek, dark, loud--but in a good conversation carry kind of way. We did not see Chef Izard that night (no matter how much Joanne W wished for it), but I have already made up my mind to visit again so maybe next time we'll see the culinary wonder."
"Girl & The Goat lives up to the hype. Â Go there as soon as you can. Â 5 stars. Â Loved the chick pea fritters, hiramassa crudo, green beans, and pig face are just a few stand outs. Best for was the lobster and pork belly with sweet sauce. Best thing I've had in a while! Â No doubt. Â Sleeper hit is the seared ahi tuna. Another is the ribs. Â Good all around food with exceptional service Â But even a good restaurant has some low points. Don't bother with the Sugo dish. I can't wait to go back."
"I really enjoyed my visit to Girl & The Goat. Our server was a little bit overwhelmed, but it's worth a visit. Â I ended up coming here twice on my last business trip here and repeat visits is a good thing."
"For a restaurant as celebrated and critically acclaimed as Girl & the Goat, I can't imagine there's anything worse than predictability. It's a fact that the food here is quite good (and consistently so), but the menu was novel and exciting three years ago and it feels like hardly anything has changed since then. Where's the evolution and growth that merits a James Beard award? Stephanie Izard totally deserves all the accolades and credit for her influence on the Chicago food scene, but her flagship is starting to feel ordinary. The pretty penny I'm spending should buy me excitement, not diminishing returns."
Best meal I've had in a long time!!! My expectations were greatly exceeded! Â I expected quality food... My meal was incredible! Â The scallops were the best scallops I've ever had... The Sea bass dish was also amazing! Â I loved the quinoa with cucumbers and tomatoes that were served with it. Â So many different layers of bold flavors... Â The ambiance was fantastic and the service was outstanding... Â Very impressed with how knowledgeable the waiter was... Definitely recommend to everyone for a great meal!
"Came in at 6pm and they said it'd be an hour wait. Luckily we snagged a bar seat about 10 minutes in, score!Service is great, despite how busy they are.Specialty drinks are $10-$15. Tasty but not that strong. After my first ""goat"" cocktail, I switched to Malbec. - Bread - 5/5 - crispy bread, yumm, hard to go wrong here but the garlic oil and green butter were outstanding. It is very garlic-y, beware!- Green beans - 3/5 - perfect texture, good fish sauce, just wasn't as spectacular as other yelpers make it out to be. The onions and nuts were a good mix for the palate though.- Salmon - 5/5 - we agreed this was the best thing we tried. Medium rare, moist, yet somewhat small salmon with ground beef, strawberries, and yogurt. It doesn't sound like they would go well together but oh my god, delicious. - Goat empanadas - 2/5 - Had to try a goat dish, wasn't too impressed. It came with an onion or cabbage topping (tasteless) and a cream cheese base. The crust was dry and there was not a lot of flavor in the goat filling. Not horrible though.- Pig face - 5/5 - Of course we had to try the infamous pig face. Tasted like breakfast exploded in my mouth. A delicious meat patty, runny egg, crispy potatoes, and whatever sauces they put it on were simply brilliant and amazing. You mix it all together and go to town. - Pineapple dessert - 5/5 - Don't remember the actual name but imagine an upside down pineapple cake x's 100. Topped with ice cream, maple bacon, candied nuts, and pineapple. It was so so good."
"Party of 4. Wild anticipation and goosebumps for this long awaited feast.It did not disappoint! Our server was great at explaining how the courses go about, along with portion size, beer choices, etc. We basically ordered about 12-15 dishes such as:  Â  Mussels, kalbi, pork ribs, pig face, confit pork belly, green beans, dessert sampler, etc etc. To sum it up, we ate every type of meat, every part of it (tongue, cheek, face), got our veggie intake as well (delicious, garlicky green beans), and couple rounds of beer to wash down the greasy, gluttonous goodness. Thanks to Miss AF, we were fortunate to get extra special entrees and a dessert platter featuring their popular items. I can write so much more, but the other hundreds and hundreds of 5 star reviews mirror my every thought and joy for this joint. Thank you Stephanie for your glorious creations!! Don't stop what you're doing!! G&G"
Great food - awesome service... Couldn't ask for more. Small portions so order a few plates. Pricey but well worth it!
"I feel like I am out of place with the 3 stars, but sometimes it is different when you are vegarian. I was just not that impressed. We had ordered quite a variety. We ordered:Warm marinated olivesPan fried shishito peppersRoasted cauliflower Roasted beetsChickpea frittersMushroom ragoutPumpkin pieCheesecakeEvening land sorcerer surah/cab-great wine Apple smacks bread-this tasted greatOverall the apple smacks bread was my favorite and that is just too bad. Other than that, nothing else really stood out besides the wine."
"The curse of the over-hype. Â Honestly, I am not really in to fancy/trendy restaurants, much prefer my small local joints, but I came here with a friend shortly after the new year. Â Very underwhelming. Â Ambiance - great, no problem. Â Food - over salted and over seasoned. Â My favorite thing i had all night was the fried pickles. Â the pigs head that everyone talked about, no more than a fried egg and hash - just don't get it. The broth the muscles came in was waaaaay to heavy and strong. Â Broccoli dish was tasty but there was A LOT of cheese in it. Â A LOT. Â Maybe I'm snottier than I think I am, but I just wasn't that impressed. Â Good, but not worth the hype."
"This place is ridiculously overrated. Waited for hours to get into this place and left nearly sick to my stomach. If you like food that is literally drenched in butter and oil without much additional flavor, then this is your place. I'll comment on a few of the items. The chickpea fritters -- I felt like this is something you would get at Chili's. Cooked with so much butter that I was full after my first small plate (these). The green beans -- Again, why do these have to be completely drenched in oil??? The goat empanadas -- I don't eat a lot of meat, but when I do, I expect it to be good. Again, these were also extremely unhealthy. The chef of the restaurant seems to use fat as a substitute for flavor which was disappointing."
"I've been to Girl and the Goat 5 times over the past year. Not once has it disappointed. The food is the best I've ever eaten (as all these reviews will tell you).I'm writing this review because I had my best friends bachelorette party dinner there last Saturday and the experience was unforgettable.The food was of course phenomenal but it's really the staff that went above and beyond. Our server, Gary, made sure we had everything we needed. The manager helped me pre-order a few bottles of wine to get started and the staff recommended I pre-orer the goat leg for the group. We felt like VIPs at dinner and I know all the girls (12 not from Chicago), left this town raving about this evening. Thanks you Girl and the Goat!"
A review is unnecessary at this point--we all know it's phenomenal. Only thing I'll say is that I've never had goat belly confit for dessert before but I'd love to end every meal with such a rich and delicious dish.
"We picked the Girl and the Goat to celebrate my husband's birthday. Â As the server recommended the three if us ordered the following six items on the menu:Pan fried shishito peppers: good smokey flavor Grilled baby octopus: a small amount of octopus but very tastyRed flintstone bread : nutty with very good chipotle flavored butterGoat carpaccio: paper thin slice. Â No taste of any goatCrisp braised pork shank: good but very rich Miso butterscotch budino: deliciousService: goodCocktails: very strongOverall, Â it was a good dining experience. However, I did not care for the small tables and very little space between the tables."
Girl and the Goat was worth the hype. The Braised Pork Shank and Green Beans are a must.
"I have wanted to visit this restaurant many times and waited too long to get reservations, and after an amazing evening, I see why! First of all the service was beyond attentive! Our waiter made us feel at home, genuinely interested in our dining experience and suggested selections only after listening to what our food interests were. Every single plate was exquisite, prepared lovingly and presented in a rustic, yet chic vibe. Wine selection was superb. It's a small plate sharing restaurant, however a small plate is a bit misleading, think of Midwestern small plates, not small at all. So delectable, it's defies any further rambling on except to just tell you not to miss this experience!"
We had a good time dining but the food did not live up to the hype as we hoped. With the small plates you get a lot of vegetables but the meats are smaller portions. Unique tastes but didn't blow us away-dessert was awesome though!
"First of all, I have to preface my review by saying that this restaurant had been on my list to visit for over a year and I went in with the highest of anticipation, after reading all the rave reviews Â here on Yelp and also being psyched by the numerous vegetarian options on the menu.I had been eyeing the table reservations page of this restaurant for almost a year and realized to growing frustration that the closest reservation I could make was never less than 2 months away. So my husband and I finally decided to crash the restaurant without a reservation at 4:30 pm on Sunday - right when the doors open.We arrived to find that there were plenty of seats open and chose to go with patio seating, since the weather was nice. The seats outside were basically long tables and benches, where you would share the table with other groups sitting adjacent to you, unless you have a large group - the two of us were totally fine sharing the table, so this was no issue.We decided to go with the small plate format, ordering 4 veggie items and 1 chicken item (the only one on the menu) for the hubby. We started with wheat bread that came with a garlic oil spread and a ramp butter spread - the spreads were delicious and the bread, warm and fresh!We then got the Kohlrabi salad - now I love salads, but my husband isn't particularly in favor of them. But my goodness, did he go after the salad like a total Veghead! The salad had blueberries, almonds, cheese and a ginger based dressing and the combination was killer.Next arrived the chickpea fritters, which were nice tasting, but neither he nor I enjoyed it as much as we had hoped. My main issue with the fritters was the very strong smell of refried oil, but my husband disliked the tanginess from the accompanying aioli as well as the overcooked peppers in the garnish.My last item was the char-grilled cauliflower - this was by far my favorite item and I am so glad I listened to the many many Yelpers before me and ordered it! The pickled onions in the garnish made for a great addition of flavor. Unfortunately, I was already 2 beers down and reaching the end of my capacity by this time and had to pack the rest for later.We ended our sumptuous meal with a milk chocolate and galangal napoleon dessert, which consisted of long crisp brownie slices and tiny scoops of ice-cream seasoned with rhubarb. The icecream had a tangy kick to it, which I absolutely loved. But then again, I was too too full at this point to thoroughly enjoy the dessert.Overall amazing experience with delightful little taste explosions, but the prices were a little on the higher side."
"Went there on a Tues evening for wife's b-day with kids. Â She was immediately greeted with happy birthday as I noted it when making this reservation. Â Place looked cool and was just as nice as the photos. Â It was around 6PM and the crowd was much older than I imagined. Â Bathrooms are very nice! Â Wasn't too fond of our waiter. Â It was too apparent he was clearly thinking about his tip from the get-go. Â He looked excited everytime I ordered something especially Â the drinks. Â He recommended 12-15 dishes for the 4 of us (note we had 2 kids!!). Â 'tho it was our first time there, I did enough research to know that would be far too many dishes. Â He also asked us to order all the dishes at once. They all came in exact order so make sure you know what you want first. Â A big mistake for me because all the dishes are pretty greasy and by the time pig face came which was the last dish, we did not have the appetite. Â Pig face should be the first dish IMO because it's very greasy. Â It's just egg with fatty pork. Â Don't know what the big hype is. Â Started with Johnny applecheese and country sour bread. Â JA bread is to die for. NY strip tartare was ok. Â Meat was too soft. Â If you don't like raw beef, skip it. Â Other dishes we tried were scallops with pork, octopus, fries, broccoli, duck tongue, and quail. Â Seasoning is pretty much the same dish to dish. Â Broccoli supposed to be wood grilled but it smelled a bit like gasoline. Â Quail is very dry and skin is soft and disgusting. Â Izard's art is mixing the weird combo of main ingredients then covering them with tons of small ingredients and spices. Â Portions are very small and overpriced but heck, you are paying for the experience. Â I read in previous reviews about complementary desserts given to those celebrating birthdays. Â So when the waiter brought the dessert menu, I asked about it. Â He chuckles and sarcastically says if I order a dessert, he'd be happy to put a candle in it. Â Dude, a simple no would've been good. Â That kinda ruined it for me. Â I didn't realize it's a selective process. Â Either do it or don't do it at all. Â Don't discriminate. Â Besides, it wasn't like we were being cheap the whole night. Â We ordered more than enough food and drinks for the Â hour we were there. Â Anyway, we ordered the pb&J, recommended by the hostess who came by to check up on us. Â What da! Â It's just a couple of donut holes with creamy chocolate peanut butter sauce. Â No wonder no one really raves about the dessert here. Drip coffee was nothing special. Â Lastly, I kept finding crumbs all over my sweater while dining and I am not a messy eater. Â I eventually realized they were lint from the raggedy napkin. Â Napkin had some food stains too although I'm sure it was washed. Â Time for some new napkins, Steph! Â  BTW, a great beer list!"
"Popularized beyond belief by the head chef (Stephanie Izzard) winning the first Top Chef series, this has become a highlight of Chicago for many visitors. Â The wife and I decided to splurge and come here on my birthday to see what the fuss for the last few years has been about.Fried Cowboy Oysters - Very tasty, and a nice presentation with each bite sitting on a curved spoon. Â For those that aren't raw oysters fans, this is a nice entry dish, but the flavor of the oyster is pretty much masked by the perfectly deep friend coating. Â Goat Cheese Tortellini - My wife is a fanatic of goat cheese, so this was must get. Â Fresh pasta wrapping flavorful goat cheese. Â It was enjoyable, but definitely needs to be served early on in the meal as the flavors are light and will get masked by the porkier dishes.Grilled octopus - Sadly, we were not a fan. Â While the veggies and octopus were all grilled, many pieces were closer to charred than comfortably grilled resulting in that bitter taste when you burn stuff on the grill. Â The waitress apologized which was excellent customer service and much appreciated. Â Would not order again.Goat empanadas - Tasty, with the goat tasting more like slightly gamier pulled pork than goat itself. Â A nice introduction to goat for those that are unintiated, but if you're looking for some strong goat flavor, there are better dishes to check out. Â This was a safe but very tasty dish.Pork shank - Perhaps the clear winner of the evening, a gigantic piece of shank roasted to perfect tenderness that pulls apart with the flick of your fork. Â With a few different sauces and fresh pita to eat it with, we gorged ourselves on this and found ourselves barely able to finish. Â A must get if it's available on the menu.Quatro Leches - An interesting take on leches cake. Â The cake was not really soaked through as one would be normally used to, and it was covered with slightly sweetened corn flakes. Â Neither my wife and I were big fans. Â The dessert is fine, but it's not the kind of rich dessert that one craves at the end of such a gluttonous meal... in fact, it was a little like eating cereal. Â Hits: Â Pork Shank, Goat Cheese Tortellini, Goat Empanadas, Cowboy OystersMisses: Â Grilled Octopus, Quatro LechesProtip: Â If you can't snag a reservation at dinner, swing in the moment they open at 4:30 and see if they have a table available for a quick dine. Â You can always snag a few seats at the bar as well, since the same food is served there, but come early to be safe!Verdict: Â Overall a great experience, and greatly attentive customer service. Â Way too much food ordered for two people who have average appetites. Â Worth the price? Â I'm undecided still. Â Would I come back? Â Probably with a larger group to share more foods (four seems ideal)."
Amazing. Worth the wait! Izard for president!
"Okay, so after all the hype about this place, we had to go try it out, and after everything I was going to just say it's eh, okay, but the service was amazing!!! We got here at like 5pm on a Saturday without a reservation and I knew I would probably have to wait quite a bit of time at the bar, which was going to be fine w/ us since we know we really needed a reservation but the manager said that if we're out by 6pm he can get us seated right away at the dining room table, which was SWEET!!! Talk about good customer service. And our server was very friendly and explained how the menu worked which was also a plus, and kinda guided us throughout the entire dinner.On to the food, the bread, which is annoying you have to pay for, is one of the BEST i've ever had in Chicago and Paris combined, just mouthwatering to the point where I can come back and just eat the bread. Now onto the appetizers, everything was just eh for me, maybe not my style, we had the chick pea fritters which are not your typical falafel, we had the fried oysters on egg salad (a recommendation by our server) and they were also just eh, then we had the pig face as an entree which was prolly the best thing of the whole evening which was overall a lil eh bc we got some really fatty parts of it, but overall, I'm glad we had the girl and the goat experience. Will we be back? We'll see, but definitely an A+ on the bread."
"We love the concept of sharing plates, so many different tastes to enjoy. Being visitors, we started out with local Chicago draft beers, all excellent and then their bread selection each paired with a different butter and relish. My personnel favorite was the popovers of which I devoured more than my fair share. From the vegetarian dishes we had the beet salad, light and refreshing, and the pirogies which was paired with some kimchi, but not too hot. Followed with maybe the best taste of the night, scallops with beans, shiitake, peanuts and a ginger aioli; this disappeared too quickly. We finished with short rib bites with a grapefruit sauce (wow) and then a pork shank and components to make your own taco which we made a dent in but carried most out. Â With reservations, seating was prompt and service couldn't have been more efficient and friendly. Advise was given as we were first time guests, and we accepted the portion sharing suggestions. Definitely a 5-star venue."
"2.5 months after making a reservation - I was finally able to enjoy this fine dining establishment.Crowded? Yes. Tables really close together? Yes. (Sometimes I swear the guy sitting at the next table thought we were talking to him!) Good food? YES!Wood Grilled Broccoli - I've always been a fan of broccoli but their version with rogue smokey bleu and spiced crispies....I probably would have eaten this veggie more as a child if it was made that way!Diver Scallops - Brown butter....mmmmmm!!!Ham Frites - fancy fries. Excellent side dish!Crisp Braised Pork Shank - FALLING off the bone it was so tender. It was big, too - took almost the whole thing home!Dessert - YOU HAVE TO GET the miso-butterscotch budino. Ahhh....soo, soo, good. Time to make another reservation!"
Love the ambiance. Food was great!
"Despite its crushing popularity, Girl and the Goat does a fantastic job accommodating guests. Â A realistic wait time is provided upon check-in, bar seats are offered up by the hostess when they're available, and a nice waiting area is provided. Â It really seems like the restaurant embraces its popularity and tries to make sure people can still come try the food, without being pretentious about their fan base. Â Nice job. The food lived up the hype. Â Pig face was delicious, but I think my fav was the escargot ravioli. Â The beer selection was nice, with several interesting local brews, including one made specially for the restaurant. Â I didn't have a bad dish all night - and everything was priced right. Â Our table of three, with booze, came to ~$100. Â The decor is cool - modern, but not harsh. Â It's inviting without being homey, which is cool."
Had the goat belly and grill cauliflower. Â The host belly with lobster and crab is flavorful but very salty. Â Cauliflower is really good.
"This review is long overdue but thankfully I was jotting down notes as I was eating so I still remember how great this place is (not that the experience isn't memorable already). During my week in Chicago, I ate at Alinea, El Ideas, here, and many other great places, but I have to admit that this place trumped all the others in experience. Perhaps it's because I was lucky to get the seats right in front of the kitchen so that my friend and I were able to chat with the chefs between bites. It's also because of how casual such great food is. The quality of the food is top notch while the environment has none of the stuffiness that often comes with top notch restaurants. When we got the menu, the choices were overwhelming. Out of awe, we gave up and asked the waiter to bring us two fish dishes, two meats, and one vegetable. We trusted his judgment. Instead, what we got to our delight were seven taster dishes. Roasted Cauliflower was my favorite vegetable. Was it because the same dish was served to Mario Batali the same night? Or was it because the chef made it right in front of me, then asked me how I liked it? Definitely both. I also loved how the pine nuts balanced out the stronger shallot taste in the dish. Sauteed green beans are a very close second. The dish looked so simple to make. The chef sauteed it in front of us with what he called his ""secret"" ingredient - fish sauce. The fish sauce was a surprisingly delicious addition. I'm still looking for a grocery store that sells fish sauce so that I can (attempt to) replicate the dish. I adored the Sugo. I wish I knew the secret behind the noodles. The noodles have a great texture. Every bite meets a delightful amount of resistance - not too tough and not too soggy. The cape gooseberries were heavenly. With the Escargot raviolli, be careful to not add too much miso sauce. I went light on the sauce and enjoyed it tremendously. My friend dunked the raviolli and didn't like the dish at all. Not going to lie, a dish with the words ""Pig face"" scared me a bit. I thought I would be eating a smile off of some creature's face. Luckily, it wasn't so. In fact, it was a crunchier meat that tasted somewhat similar to chicken and waffles. I'm definitely going to go back there next time I'm in Chicago! Hopefully I get the kitchen seats again."
An amazing meal and overall experience! Â Be prepared to discover things you never expected yourself to eat... You'll love it!
We were in Chicago for a food convention.

Delicious meal. Dumplings (celery root and cheese) were the highlight. Also liked the goat empanadas. Pig face was pretty greasy. Service was okay. The two of us came in on a Friday @ 430pm as a walk in and were seated at a communal table (less ideal but was happy I got to experience the restaurant). The wine pours were inconsistent and chintzy.
"This was amazing! It is apparently really difficult to get reservations, but we happened into the restaurant at just the right time, because 3 bar seats opened up as we walked in. We literally had no wait, and then we spent the next 2 hours eating the most delicious food of my life, and some very yummy wine. There was not anything that we disliked at this restaurant. It was amazing and it ruined me for other food for a few days. I had serious food depression.Anyway, here's what we tasted...all of which was AWESOME!!! The highlight was the miso-butterscotch budino.Definitely go check it out. Apparently the menu changes periodically, so you may not get everything that we tasted...which also makes me SOOO excited about going back.sauteed green beans: fish sauce vinaigrette . cashewskohlrabi salad: fennel . evalon . blueberries . toasted almonds . ginger dressingwood grilled broccoli: rogue smokey bleu . spiced crispiesgreen garlic potato wontons: ramps . shiitake mushrooms . asparagus . pickled rhubarb . spiced pecansdiver scallops: baby choke'n'goat stir fry . currant tapenadeescargot ravioli: bacon . tamarind-miso sauceham frites: smoked tomato aioli . cheddar beer saucecharred pork belly: spring onions . tangy jus . sunflower seedswood fired walter's chicken: asparagus . rhubarb . green goddess dressingcrisp braised pork shank: grilled spring onion kimchee . buttermilk dressing . naanmiso-butterscotch budino: bacon toffee . glazed pineapple . candied cashews"
"The service was great but there is an air of pretention. The place was beautiful inside and I really liked the bathroom. 6 of us ordered one dish to share with the others since we weren't extremely hungry. We did end up with food in our hair but they were quick to serve another and they also took it off of our bill.Unforutnately, the problem was with the food. It just wasn't as good as I expected. Some things were over-salted and just not delicious.The purple pig has a similar vibe, but they do it much better."
"So I've experienced Stephanie Izard's cuisine in bits and pieces around the city at culinary events and Little Goat Diner, but I've never tried the original. Â Walking down Randolph on our way to the Taste, we peeked in and noticed several empty tables. Â After pretty much giving up on trying to actually score a reservation, we figured we might as well try to get in since we were already there. Â Lucky us, they were able to fit us in, although giving us a time limit before their next reservation. Â Regardless, it was ample time and we were hungry! Â The space is beautiful, with an open kitchen - always a big hit for me. Â The tables are a bit close, so we had to hear the server's intro speech three times since they sat the two parties on either side of us at pretty much the same time. Â With the small plate concept, we were able to try four dishes before we were stuffed. Â We had the goat empanadas, the pig face, ham frites and salmon, each plate displaying a symphony of flavors with the most surprising combination of salmon and strawberries, and perfectly cooked. Â I'm happy to report that it lives up to all the hype."
"Once you get over the somewhat loud dinning room, you are treated to one of the best menus I've ever experienced. The fact that the food is from local farms and the servers are smart and knowledgeable makes Girl and the Goat a rather pleasant dining location. If you call ahead, you will find that they can no longer take reservations. Don't fret. Go early and walk in. They will seat you within the hour. Â Or you can park at the comfortable bar (where we sat) for 3-4 hours (like we did) and not get a sore back. The menu is broken down in to three sections: vegetable, fish and meat. The offerings under each section are extensive, creative and simply delicious (even when you can't see some of the ingredients coming together in a cohesive manner). The fact that the whole experience comes with smart, knowledge service staff and very reasonable prices makes this dining experience a five-star affair, in my opinion. Let's start with the vegetable section: The list reads fairly pedestrian. You will be attracted to the kohlrabi salad, if you are a foodie. Well, don't be so pretentious. Try the green beans. Trust me. In fact, don't trust me, trust your server. More of that in a minute. The green beans are immaculately cooked to perfection (firm) and topped with cashews and fish sauce that you will not forget. Since the portions are too generous, stop eating this dish after a few bites and take it home or you will fill up. The cauliflowers are also exquisite here. Fishes... Haven't sampled too many out of this one. Crudo is the one to beat. It is simply phenomenal. All of the components work really complement the fish. Trust me, the pork belly does not overpower here. Escargot raviloi is also delightful. The octopus on the menu, while great as a composition, didn't do it for me since the octopus was frozen and not fresh (or poorly cooked, hard to say). Several other items sampled from the menu checked all the marks here. Meats... Pig face is a classic here but the pork shank that recently made the list steals the show. We sampled quite a few things on this section. While nothing (0ther than the shank) was mind-blowing, they were consistently good. The menu morphs naturally over time. I see that some of the attached pics of the menu is already outdated for example. The wine selection and the server staff complements what I can say is one of the best dinner menus I've seen. As for trusting the server: Everything we ordered from the menu on our own was great. Everything our server recommended we try was mind-blowing. As pretentious northwesterns, we looked down on the Salmon on the menu. Our server brought it out for free, just so we can try. It was the best fish selection on there. Farmed salmon, no less. We have been taught a lesson there. And well."
"Totally FUN! This place has the current mojo and explores both vegetarian and snout to tail gastronomy. A fun cocktail menu to explore my ""Before and After"" was novel but quite bitter. From there the fried squash blossoms which were very nice, but if there was crab in them, I couldn't find it or taste it. The goat belly with lobster was wonderful but oh soo rich! The pickled fennel was just barely acidic, more vinegar in the pickles in the dish would have given it more balance.  Â  Â Love to go back and try more dishes, Â it just seems a little fine tuning is needed to take it to ""Whaoo As good as it gets!""  PS sat at the bar, service and people watching was primo. Tattooed bar staff were as helpful as they were colorful."
"I made reservations 1.5 months before our trip to Chicago and the best I could get was Wednesday at 8:30. We arrived about 30 minutes early and before we could even get drinks at the bar our table was ready. The vibe is laid back and the music selections added to the upbeat atmosphere. Wait staff is amazing in guiding your choices. I appreciate that they aren't ""trying too hard"" or pretentious with all the raving accolades they have! Here's the break down of our meal:-goat blue bread: served with caramelized onions and a sweet butter. This was my husband's favorite dish of the night. It was incredible! -fried pickles: had to get them as they are one of my husband'a favorites. Pickles were homemade and the batter was light and didn't take away from the taste of the pickles. A good, simple pick that gave us some acidity to our meal. - goat empanadas: my first experience with goat. These were delicious! Meat was tender, melt in your mouth good and the feta was a perfect compliment to the sweet meat.-green beans: wow! How do they make these green beans so amazing?! The salty Â fish sauce rounds out the sweet green beans and the perfectly roasted and crunchy cashews gave texture and cut through the richness of the sauce. Get these green beans! -roasted pig face: another first for me. All the flavors work so well together and the crispy potato sticks finish the combination of the perfectly cooked egg and the crispy pig.I had high expectations for this restaurant and it did not disappoint. What a fabulous experience and one of the best meals of my life! Next time I'm in Chicago I will be back. Now, off to try Little Goat...,"
"Went here on a whim and we got a seat at the bar. Â It was really good food. Â My style is more the simple, good, and inexpensive. Â This is good, but somewhat expensive. The pig face dish lived up to the hype. Â Worth checking out, don't know that I am in a hurry to go back."
"The ambiance is very nice and the service is excellent. Â The items on the menu are very unique and I definitely tried things I otherwise would not have tried. Â Everything tasted good, but it's the service that deserves the 5 stars."
With almost 1400 review what more can i say! I have now been twice. Â Every time I go i immediately make a reservation for as soon as Â I can. I got the chickpea fritters both times. Â They were much tastier than you'd imagine. Â Creamy! Get the pig face! Get the Ham Frites!Get the Goat Rilletes!Get the woodfired Chicken! It was amazing! Get it all. I ALSO CANNOT SING ENOUGH PRAISE FOR THE THAI-CHILI CHOCOLATE GELATO. Â I Got it both occasions and now i'm considering going in 3 times a week after work to get it as a reward.
"Wow is the only word I can think of to describe this place. My husband surprised me with birthday dinner reservations earlier in the week. I had heard so much about this place that I was just hoping it lived up to my expectations. It did, and went above and beyond.To start, our server was great. He made welcome recommendations, and even asked if he could change my cocktail order because there was one he knew I would like better. He was 100% correct. He was very attentive, without being pushy, and was always around if we needed him. On to the food...Their cocktails are amazing. We each had one to start the meal off right. I had The Best of Three. Highly recommend.We ordered:Chickpea Fritters: The mix of chick peas and mozzarella is phenomenal.Squash Blossom Rangoons: These came out in actual blossoms, so they looked like closed flowers. Amazing taste.Diver Sea Scallops: Hands down the BEST scallops I have ever tasted (I'm guessing it was due to the foie gras vinegarette). Perfectly cooked, they absolutely melt in your mouth.Pig Face: This was definitely the dish that made me nervous. Was it really face? I'd rather not know. It was just perfectly seasoned, very tender, and delicious.We ordered bread too (with the blackberry honey jam and duck fat butter). Between all of that, I left fully satisfied and definitely excited to come back in the near future. A truly wonderful night of food, and a great way to celebrate my birthday."
"Outstanding meal with service second to none. The pig face is the most mentioned in other reviews, but the duck tongues with Ahi were excellent. Along with the Pig face my kids ate everything. Great experience."
"Best dinner. Â Ever. Â Tried the salad, pig face, beef heart, scallops, duck tongue, mussels, ham frites, goat belly, beef tongue, pineapple dessert, chocolate dessert, and apple dessert. Â Also had an old fashioned, which was the best cocktail of the 10 or so places we tried while in Chicago. Â Ranked in order or preference were 1-pig face (melts in your mouth), 2-scallops (done perfectly), 3-beef heart, 4-beef tongue, 5-mussels, 6-salad, 7-ham frites, 8-goat belly, and 9-duck tongue. Â Desserts, 1-chocolate, 2-pineapple, 3-apple. Â All entrees were really tasty. Â Will be going back soon. Â Go with a party of 4 so you can try 8-10 dishes. Â With more than 4 there may not be enough of each dish to sample."
"I had been anxiously waiting to try Girl & the Goat for months and Stephanie Izard didn't disappoint! My friend and I arrived before the rest of the party so we went right over to the bar and magically there were two open seats! We had two glasses of Cab Sav before we were seated right as the rest of the party arrived. Food was great but I feel like that is almost just because of the sauces. The green beans, mussels, pig face and goat belly were my favorites. The broccoli was way too smokey. I had the mixed tequila drink to end the dinner and it was awesome! I believe with a bottle of wine, 2 glasses of wine, a mixed drink and 6 plates it was about $180 without tip!"
"Great vibe. Â Relaxed, although a bit loud. Â Adventurous menu not all hits, but feels at ease with the venue and part of the conversation. Â Scallops were great.Food: A-Atmosphere: AService: A"
Everything is delicious but the food is too salty!
Great service. Goat neck was great. empanadas were excellent. Beef tongue was the best overall. Great music and crowded the entire 2.5 hours we were there. Only downfall was each dish was a little bit salty. Definitely go back for more goat!
"From food to service, Stephanie Izard's Girl & the Goat did not disappoint! It was surprisingly affordable too. Gibson H. and I paid about $180 including tip and tax for 4 dishes, bread, dessert and a bottle of wine--more than enough for 2!- make a reservation in advanced- try a goat item on the menu!- server recommended 2 dishes a person (sharing of course). I'd go with 3 a person if you love good food and can manage!!- seating for big and small parties. Bar seating is available as well- open kitchen makes the atmosphere relaxed. also fun to watch cooks at workWould highly recommend for a date or a dinner with close friends!"
"Great Food , Tiny portions. Â I came here for a birthday dinner and didn't know you could eat here without a reservation. Â There are shorter tables at the entrance where you can order and get seated pretty quickly. Â If you are really hungry please do go Little Goat. Â Same type of food, but cheaper and more to eat."
"With over 2000 reviews and nearly 5 star rating, there's not much to say about this place other than it rocks! Everyone can read reviews on the food and look at the pictures. Yes, it's that awesome here. The menu changes with the season so it always keeps begging you to come back and try it againService - I had made reservations for a Saturday night and it turned out that Open Table had it reserved for the next Saturday night. I don't know how that happened, but I don't remember making it during a weekend when I won't be in town. They suggested we could order from the lounge/couch area, and we were fine with that, but 30 min passed and the hostess came up and asked if we wanted a table instead. Â Most places would probably just skip you as you're already sitting but the hostess was awesome to get us to an actual table for the night. I know Chicago is known for great food and it rivals other major cities and I truly believe that good food doesn't have to come with an extreme price tag. This place doesn't give off the pretentious feel like other places do nor do you have to get all dressed up and act like you're some big foodie/hipster to enjoy it. The Girl and the Goat is a place where you can enjoy good food prepared by a passionate chef with attention to detail. It goes down as one of the most memorable places I've been to here in Chicago."
"I went to GATG last night with my husband and another couple. We were all ready for a good meal, but what we received was beyond expectations.We started with the beet salad. I love beets, and the salad reminded me of why I do. We also got the kohlrabi salad and the hamachi crudo as part of the first wave of food--all three cold dishes were exceptional, with nice texture and flavor combinations.Next came the goat empanadas. OMG. If you get one thing, get the empanadas. Â They're light and crispy on the outside, but filling and homey on the inside. The feta cheese with dressing that comes with them was my husband's favorite bite. Seriously, get the empanadas.We also split the skatewing croquettes, grilled octopus, and escargot ravioli. All were delicious. The sauces were enough to satisfy, but each dish could have been a favorite.We did it. We got the pig face. We were all expecting a pig head (we were thinking Lord of the Flies) to appear at our table. Instead, we got a stack of crispy, savory pork deliciousness topped with an egg. My husband mixed it all together before we split it into four portions of pig heaven...I don't know if all mixed up is how it's supposed to be eaten, but I had no complaints.We ended the meal with two desserts. Honestly, all I remember about dessert is that both bowls were licked clean.All of that plus two glasses of wine and one beer came to $185 pre-tip. The four of us left pleasantly full--not over-stuffed, and definitely not wanting any more. Honestly, we could have done without dessert, but after waiting three months, we were going all out.We will go back. And you should as well. The service is great (water glasses refilled after every sip! Food aversions accounted for! Speedy plate removal!) and the food lives up to the hype. 5 stars, no doubt."
"I took away one star for the food and one star for the hype. The food was very good, but I 've definitely had better dinners in Chicago. I called four months in advance for my fiance's birthday dinner and I still only got a 5:15 res. I figured it must be out of this world if it's this difficult to get in to and it just didn't live up to my expectations. The food was good, but we only had one dish that I would go back for.Cocktail list- very small, nothing specialWood grilled broccoli- very good, a little bit rich for my tastePotato wantons- Neither of us liked these at allCrispy duck tongue- Absolutely delicious! We both loved it. Definitely worth it.Beef cheek- My fiance loved itScallops- Delicious but I've had better"
"My last days of living In Chicago ended so perfect, because my fiancÃ© and I had the opportunity to dine at The Girl and The Goat. We both are chefs and were so impressed by the interior and service. Every dish that came out was perfect. Rustic, fresh, and the flavors were spot on and unique. Hands down to the Chef, you are great and I'm so happy to have eaten at your restaurant."
What an eclectic menu. Â I love the small plates that allowed us to order tapas style so we could taste so many options.
"My sister and I were probably the luckiest patrons of last Thursday. We entered without reservations and got seated within 5 minutes. Following that was an exploratory menu for me, trying different plates and a great cocktail called the Lake Effect. They used local and regional liquors/liqueurs. The pork shank was so delicious and so tender, well worth $25. I'll try to make a reservation for next time. It's a great place with good ambiance and a cool painting on the wall. I'd recommend it for anyone willing to make an advanced reservation or take their chances without one. I lucked out, and enjoyed myself."
"Friendly and knowledgable wait staff. Â Food was outstanding! Â Love, love, loved the green beans!"
"Noooooo!A one star affair for one simple reason: I never had the opportunity to try the food.We showed up on time, maybe even five minutes early, for our reservation.A four-top of sycophants was seated approximately the same time to my right, and to my left was another four-top that was in the process of ordering. Â The four-tops had different servers. Â We were in the middle.Despite making eye contact to each of the servers, we were ignored. Â The water guy was diligent and very friendly and kept our glasses full. Â ""Your server will be with you in a moment!"" he stated.That moment never happened. Â After waiting about 20 minutes, we threw in the towel and left.We mentioned this experience to the hostess who never said ""sorry"" or acknowledged any responsibility on the restaurant's part to, you know, serve customers, but insisted on giving us some sort of free drink coupon. Â Really? Â We said no thanks and left (she ran out after us to try to convince us to come back. Â Where was this enthusiasm before? Â Right.). Â Upon arriving home, there was a message on our machine from the manager. Â No apology. Â No responsibility. Â Just some sort of watered down hogwash excuse making and ""I know this was frustrating for you"". No ""we're sorry about this experience"". Â ""we're sorry it happened"" Â ""we're sorry you had to wait and were ignored, we care and will address whatever shortcoming happened"", etc. Â Nothing. Â Just smug arrogance of a restaurant that doesn't have to care about its customers.Funny. Â Had anybody even remotely said ""sorry"" and taken responsibility, we would have given this gang a second try, and not needed any freebies or garbage like that.Now, there's nothing they can do to repair this. Â All I can do is forewarn the rest of you about this shortcoming. Â And that if something does go wrong, unless they've learned, they're not going to take responsibility for it.And no way do I perceive this as ""the server's fault"". Â Not in the least. Â It's management."
"Top chef and James Beard winner and one would naturally expect a great thing... Â But one recurring thought I had throughout the dinner was ""does Girl & the goat put more sodium than PF Chang?"". Everything tasted loaded with salt/soy sauce like my mother's cocking which she serves with a bowl of plain white rice. Â While combination of different ingredients is interesting, the end result was not something exciting, but rather pretty pedestrian than unpretentious. Each dish is not too pricy, but we ended up paying $200 for 2 with taxes and tip. The best part of the meal was the desert, as well as the cocktails."
"Great food - great service. I've heard its hard to get a reservation but we went around 5 on a Tuesday and there was plenty of open bar space. They have really comfortable (and not gross) couch areas in the bar which I loved. The servers know their food and wine. We used them for many recommendations and you could tell they study up. Â Our server also used ""jazz hands"" to describe a wine - hilarious. I suggest going - reserve well in advance or sit in the bar."
"I had high expectations based on the reviews and the restaurant lived up to every one of them. The atmosphere was great and the food was incredible. Probably some of the best green beans and cauliflower I have ever had. Also, if you're an old fashioned enthusiast, they are top notch."
The food was extraordinaire! My favorite was the goat carpaccio. The different flavors mixed in my mouth and had a party! The wood fired scallops were pretty good. It was all delicious! I ended with the dessert which was also amazing! Try this spot when in Chicago.
"I made a reservation to this restaurant 2 months early, to ensure me and my boyfriend would have a great experience prior to JT/Jay-Z in Chitown. Best decision I ever made :)Girl and the Goat is a quaint, eclectic and semi-hipster restaurant located in West side Chicago, we took a taxi over and were promptly seated to the Chef's table, which definitely took our experience to a whole new level! Â The menu is very rustic, creating not so common combinations of proteins, seafood and vegetables, commanding flavor and definite respect. I am always impressed by dishes that boast new ingredients, or techniques I could never do at home, and each dish did exactly that:Wine: Brut Rose, La Maison du Cremant - added a very refreshing, romantic feel to our appetizers and champagne. Starters: Raw Kusshi Oysters - yum. Very fresh, albeit small as it's only got like four on a plate for two people. Goat Empanadas on the HOUSE - drool. Our wonderful server gave us one compliments of the chef and it was just heavenly. The tender, tasty goat meat is wrapped and fried, topped with a tropical heirloom tomato salsa, tzatziki sauce, and sheep feta. We almost bought more of these. Green beans - cooked perfectly, topped with an aioli sauce to die for. Complemented our meal perfectly.Entrees: Walter's Chicken - Moist, tender, no complaints here. Pig face - a must-try. It's not really a pig *face* but the cheek/neck of the pig, crisped with tamarind flavor, maple syrup, fried potato slivers and a fried egg. Very rich but one-of-a-kind most definitely. This place kicked off a magical night to remember, and I'd recommend this to anyone visiting the Chicago area. Definitely coming back again."
"My life didn't have meaning until I ate that roasted pig face. I didn't realize it until I raised the mush to my lips, exploding into a perfectly melded combination maple-fat-yolk-crispy. I'll be dreaming of this dish for a long, long time. Honestly everything is good here. If you're by yourself, sit down at the bar and be prepared for the best date you've ever had with yourself. But seriously, just eat the pig face (if your diet so allows). There's also a very nice waiter here who resembles the Tenth Doctor Who. Let him pick what you eat. Tip him well. He will take care of you."
"This place was impossible to get a reservation for (we ended up with a 4:45pm dinner reservation on a Monday). The hotel concierge was more surprised about our ability to get into Girl & The Goat than Alinea. :) And the restaurant delivered! Everything was delicious, but my favorite was definitely the wood oven roasted pig face. Will definitely be coming back next time I visit Chicago.Love the vibe of the space too!"
"I'm sure it's all been said and done but if you're unfamiliar with goat you will shortly become a fan. Carpaccio, mousse, empanadas but if you're scurred o the goat the other options are amazing as well. The drinks are on point too, from the tequila drink with Rose liqour ( forgot the name but a must try) to their wine list it's all good. Now just try to get a table."
"Unanimously brilliant reviews from various food enthusiasts led me to Girl & the Goat, a gastropub opened in 2010 by Top Chef Winner (and former Scylla chef/owner) Stephanie Izard. Super excited, I promptly made my dinner reservations for the first night in Chicago at the Girl & the Goat. We were seated promptly by professional and courteous hostess. A simple but an ever changing menu comprised of three sections - Vegetables, Fish, and Meat with interplay between all three. To experience the entire menu, we chose to order a few from each section. Mind you, I did have to choose wisely as this interplay of ingredients can make it hard for people with allergies like myself.I have been fortunate enough to have traveled around the world and eaten some amazing food along the way; exceptional cooking is the only criteria that will bring me back to revisit a restaurant.This being said, everyone is allowed good or bad day, careless or rude service is excusable one time around, and ambiance helps but is not a necessary component for a memorable dining experience.Frankly, I didn't get it. Don't get me wrong. There is plenty to appreciate at Girl & the Goat. It's not a disappointing restaurant by any means, unless like me, you walked in with great expectations based on the glowing publicity it received. The problem I faced is that there were too many hit-or-misses that I find it hard to recommend whole heartedly.The menu is considered a 'sharing' process but to me the minuscule portions seemed more like a tasting menu. The dishes are well-executed with unusual pairings and I might add, bold in certain areas. Still, it lacked the ""wow"" factor. Â The assisting staff was more pleasant and eager to help than the head waiter assigned to our table who seemed more interested in pushing his ideas to us rather than listening or even understanding our needs.I am not saying that Girl & and the Goat can't be the restaurant, food enthusiasts appeared to agree on, but in my experience, it didn't reflect this caliber of restaurant. Â It is a good restaurant but is it worth the hype? My dining experience at Girl & and the Goat left me wondering: Â Did I walk in with too many expectations? Is publicity, any publicity, a good thing after all?"
"Let me begin by saying that this is one of the best meals I've ever had. Ever.My friends and I had made reservations for G&G about two months ago, so our hype built up over time. Needless to say that the Girl and the Goat lived up to every expectation I had. As a group of 5, we were seated at a nice round table near a window looking out onto Randolph. Our waitress, Taylor, was very nice and super helpful. Since it was our first time dining there, we had a slew of questions about the food. The Girl and the Goat is tapas style, especially with a big group since you get to try a lot of different things on the menu. She suggested we order two to three dishes per person.Out of the 10ish dishes we ordered (and we were adventurous), my favorites were the baby octopus, chickpea fritters, escargot ravioli, pork shank and ham frites. We also tried the goat heart, which was a little out of our comfort zone - needless to say we ended up loving it. If you haven't had it before, the texture is thin and a bit rubbery. It's cut into small pieces and cooked with blood oranges and other vegetables. Delicious. The atmosphere was a trendy and a bit loud. In the back, we could see Stephanie Izard doing her thaaang, which was awesome. I also appreciated that the dishes were brought out to us during a two hour span which allowed us time to savor each dish. In short, this place is a MUST try. For those afraid to try new and exotic foods, this is the place to do so - you won't regret it."
"I heard about this place through friends in Portland that it was a MUST place to go while in Chicago. Luckily I did my research and made reservations (2.5 months out) on our last night in Chicago. Glad we did because it was packed even on a Tuesday night! We got seated right away. The atmosphere is very lively and decor was chic. It was THE BEST meal in Chicago hands down! Our favorite was the ""pig face"" which was pork with sauces and an over easy egg! The waiter helped us with the selection for wine and he was on point! I would love to come here again!"
Pigface is a must. Â Pretty much had everything in the menu because I went with a large group and the pigface was the best.
Great place with excellent tapas style dishes. Â Order several dishes. Â The Pig Face is notable. Â One negative is the reservations and actually being seated on time. Â I have made reservations several times and end up drinking at the bar for an hour before being seated. Â For that I give them 3 stars due to being unaccountable with reservations. Â Other then that their food is great!
"I'll spare my gushing rant of how great this place is because it seems that a thousand others have it covered. I will say this: Pure foodgasmic bliss! I was taken to another place.Drink: Double Barrel- I am a whiskey/bourbon drinker, so this was just for me, even though it was cognac. The first one wasn't as great as the 2nd one b/c the 2nd one had more ginger in it and less bitters. The ginger made an unexpectedly remarkable difference because I debated ordering it again. Warning: This drink is strong. I loved it!Oysters: Forgot the name, but it had bacon and horseradish. The oysters were melt in my mouth. Flavor was great. However, I could've done without the bacon. It was an unwelcome texture contrast to the soft and goopy oyster. I also tend to be an oyster purist, but was curious and I love bacon, but the bacon flavor didn't add too much. Unique experience nonetheless. The oyster itself was superb.Lamb tartare: Melt in your mouth. Delicious. I like the thin crackers they give you so you can really taste the lamb. The dill stuck out, and it was a welcome flavor. Goat empanada: You can tell it's goat, and it was fabulous! The flavor marrying with other ingredients, like the hummus, made it a successful dish. Goat was tender, not gamey, but there is a slight whiff of it. It's not goat unless there's a whiff of game. Chickpea fritters: heaven on the palate, like a Belgium truffle chocolate or a genache melting in your mouth. Crispy outside and smooth creaminess on the inside. The mix with other ingredients also added to its deliciousness.Breads: We ordered the pretzel and sour dough. Both excellent, warm, soft. Great spreads! The tomato spread had a great tang. Mushroom spread, flavorful. Ham Frites with beer cheddar sauce: solid! it was like bacon flavored french fries...dipped in beer cheddar? Yes please!Diver scallops: best scallops i've ever had. Perfect sear, perfectly cooked, with the inside moist. The scallop melds in your mouth. The duck was also a perfect complement to the dish. This was one of my favorites.Goat cheese tortellini: Another solid dish. The stuffing was rich and decadent. The pasta was made and cooked perfectly.Woodoven roasted Pig face: Another favorite. Crisp pork and the egg was perfectly over easy and it does make a difference. Don't underestimate the egg. The pork itself is a bit salty, but that's what the egg and maple sauce are there for. It wasn't meant to eat deconstructed, but I tried it anyway.Goat cheese cheesecake: Oh...my...GOODNESS! It was my birthday, and the waitress' birthday was the day after mine, so we hi-fived and she gave me this delicious awesomeness! I was in a state of sheer joy, eyes closed, savoring the decadent and perfect flavors in my mouth. Wow.Service: Wonderful. I think Jodie was her name. I'm going to verify and come back and edit to give her the kudos. She answered all of our questions, very friendly and easy-going. Our water was constantly filled, we were provided clean dishes regularly, and our dishes came out in the perfect increments of time. A spectacular experience indeed!!"
"One of the top restaurants in the country. The food is amazing and really unique.The service, however, is what makes this place high on my ""must re-visit"" list. We went very late one night and it was packed. When we walked up to the host, I mentioned the fact that our team of four people could ""make ourselves very small"" and fit at any table. They laughed and said they would work to try to find a table as soon as possible - but it was going to be more like 2-hours before we could be seated.They suggested we wait at the bar. Needless-to-say, the bar was a zoo. We did, however, find a small opening. The bar tender was awesome. She was quick to get us drinks and even brought a complimentary dish ""for our wait.""Keep in mind that the Girl & the Goat is one of the most popular spots in Chicago-land. Equally important to remember is the fact the we went on a very busy night. Also, we did not have a reservation (I tried - the earliest I could get a reservation was three weeks out). With all of that said - we were literally seated at our table within 15-minutes of camping out at the bar. Amazing!Was the food great? Yes. Was the service and the hospitality amazing? Out of this world for a trendy, ""must visit"" place. I will definitely be back!"
"just read the other reviews. nothing new to add on. pigface, duck tongue, ny tartare were excellent. nothing to compare them against since i dont typically go looking for pigface after looking at the mirror in the morning. Food was a bit on the salty side if you are a health freak like me. Â Getting to the toilet might be an issue If you have mobility issue,"
"Ok after all the rave and waiting to make my move to check out this hotspot I wasn't as amazed as I expected. Â We had to pull some amazing strings to get a table and even then it was the time that maybe senior citizens eat! We arrived at 4:30pm to be seated when the restaurant opened and had to be out by 6pm. Â Although it seemed pressured dinner ran smoothly since they brought out the food super fast.We tried many things on the menu and I could eat them all but have to say there was no skimping on the fattiness of the meal!...you could taste how rich each dish was in every bite and after awhile my stomach couldn't take it...roasted cauliflower pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint - great dish but could feel the oils and richness aftter just two bites.hiramasa crudo crisp pork belly. chili aioli. caperberries - I picked off the pork belly, was averageroyal red shrimp ceviche white asparagus . pepitas . spiced cilantro . popiah - was very disappointed in this dish. Â Lacked the flavore I was looking for.Whole Fried Loup De Mer bacon sweet n'sour, potato aioli, tempura broccoli - All I could taste was the tempura. Â The fish was moist on the inside but disappointed in the tempura broccoli. It lacked any flavor beside oil.we also had two of the breads that are on their seasonal menu. Â The leek butter was amazing and the breads were delicious!Overall was a good experience but not worth the hassle to go back."
"If you want some great food for a reasonable price this is the spot to go. Great vibe and atmosphere, lots of unique food options, and a gluten free menu. Only downside is the wait time- about 2 hour wait for a Monday night, and the tables are pretty cramped together. Every time someone in a side table wanted to get out, everyone had to shift their table to the side. They have a sister location across the street, but with more low key food options."
"Husband and I ate here yesterday and had an amazing experience. The food was on point, the waiter and busboys were quick, friendly, and alert. We got lucky and were seated at the chef's table, which meant a front row seat to the kitchen. The chefs working in front of us humored us and answered questions that we had. The kitchen worked like a well oiled machine and it was beautiful to watch. It truly was one of the best dining experiences I've had in Chicago. We will be back. Also- for people who are worried about reservations! If you have no time constraints for when and where, just check the day of on the online site. We made reservations yesterday for yesterday evening because someone cancelled!"
"The first female winner of Top Chef has her own restaurant and it was the #1 place I wanted to try during the Chicago trip. This place has all the buzz, the accolades, and a dish I came to try, The Pig Face.We showed up a little after 5PM and all the walk-in tables were already taken. It would be another 45 minutes or so to wait for a table. So we waited in the restaurant and sat down at the lounge area. My determination to eat the Pig Face would not be denied. The hostess grabbed us about an hour later and proceeded to take us to....a communal table? That was unexpected for sure. No matter, I was starving and didn't want to make a fuss about having our own table. On to the food!Warm Apple Pistachio Ginger Bread: Initially we didn't order their bread. Didn't want to fill real estate up with unnecessary items. But seeing virtually everyone else around us with a loaf of bread at their table, we had to try one of their in-house made breads. Great choice with the sweet jewels of apple and the nutty crunch of the pistachios. And it was WARM! It should be a sin to serve cold bread ever.Grilled Baby Octopus, Guanciale, Wax Beans, Romano Beans, Radish, Pistachio-Lemon Vinaigrette: The ""salad"" course we chose. Tender, slightly smoky junior cephalopods. It was a symphony in a dish.Grilled Rainier Oysters, Goat Mignonette, Goat Jus: Plump, juicy oysters sitting in a dark, amber goat jus sprinkled with the goat mignonette. It was a shame there were only 4 to an order. I could have devoured a dozen on my own.Chickpea Fritters, Pickled Red Onions, Stewed Chick Peas, Crave Brother's Mozzarella: This was solid, but not spectacular. Perhaps the addition of a meat protein would take the dish to the stratoshere. May I suggest bacon?Sweet n' Sour Cod Cheeks, Bacon, Potato Aioli, Tempura Broccoli: An Asian-like dish. The cod cheeks dissolved in your mouth. I'm a proponent of frying foods to make them better. So the crispy tempura broccoli was a hit for me.Wood Oven Roasted ""Pig Face"", Sunny Side Egg, Tamarind, Cilantro, Potato Stix: The item everyone raves about. They take all the meat from the pig's face and form it into a roasty, toasty disk of porcine goodness. The addition of a fried sunny side egg was like guilding the lily but I wasn't complaining. If you're a pork lover, this is the dish for you.Pear Wonton, Parsnip PurÃ©e, Pineapple Sweet and Sour, Candied Ginger, Tamarind Stracciatella: For dessert, a perfect end to the meal. Numerous textures and temperatures on the plate. My palate was surprised with the crunch of the wonton and candied ginger, the soothing coolness of the stracciatella, and the delightful brightness of the pineapple. The only complaint I had was when we were sat by the hostess she said we had to be done by 7:30PM because a big party was going to take over the whole communal table at that time. When we left our table, there was no big party taking over our table. Even so, a new party of 2 sat across from us as we were enjoying our dessert. Our dinner would have been even more enjoyable had we not felt the need to rush a bit to finish before that 7:30PM deadline.I will definitely be back. Especially since I didn't get to meet Chef Stephanie. In an ironic twist, I asked if we could meet her. But the server said she was in the San Francisco Bay Area on a book tour.Overall: 4.5 stars"
"I'm one of the few not obsessed with Top Chef, but I""ve been eagerly waiting for Stephanie Izard to open this for quite some time now. Â I like good food, I'm a girl and I like goats (or at least goat cheese when I""m not pregno) so my expectations were pretty high. And they've been even higher since reading the fabulous Yelp reviews since Girl and the Goat opened their doors a few weeks ago. Would Girl and the Goat live up to all the hype? YES, it sure did...My friends and I were lucky enough to score 7pm reservations on a Monday night here. Perhaps an easy task when it comes to most restaurants, but we're talking about the hottest restaurant in town. We were greeted by the most awesome waiter ever, Meadows, who was one of the few they moved from their other restaurants (Boka, Landmark, Perennial). Â A meal with Meadows is a blast...this alone is worth 5 stars, but it turns out the food is just as good as the service.My party of 3 shared the following:* Bread with whipped liver butter (i could have eaten 18 loaves of this bread)* Chickpeas (one of my favorites of the night)* Peppers (tasty, but my mouth was on FIRE)* Soft Shell Crab served with corn (my absolute favorite of the night- incredible!)* Skate Wing (loved the octopus that came with it)* Seared Scallops (the butter on this was heavenly)* Smoked Goat Pizza (eh, could have done without this one)Meadows also had the bartender whip me up a virgin cocktail, which was so good that my non-pregnant friends had drink envy. I was nice enough to let them both have a sip. Â Fortunately, they seemed quite content with their wine.We couldn't stop raving about every single bite of this meal...and even whipped out our calendars to see when we could come back for more deliciousness! Well done Stephanie...this was worth the wait!*"
"I don't get what the excitement is surrounding this place. The noise level in the restaurant exceeded my comfort level. Not only was the place packed with noisy, high energy customers, but the music was excessively loud requiring everyone to talk even louder. We were seated along a row of 2 tops so closely positioned, that the host had to pull the table completely out to allow me to sit down. Â It felt like we were also dinning with the people on either side of us and allowing everyone to ogle each others food. The wait staff was very knowledgeable about the food and so very excited about the restaurant concept, conveying the notion that we were so very luck to have gotten a table at this very special place.The use of local sourced ingredients is a wonderful trend passionately embraces at the Girl and the Goat. The concept is to order several small plates to share. Which we did. Of course, we had to try something goat, so we opted for the braised goat belly which was delicious, but afforded the two of us each two small bites of goat for around $19. It also included lobster and crab, which in my opinion added nothing to the dish and would have preferred more of the goat. Â Our other offering included the Diver Scallops, two to be exact, that were perfectly cooked but with an uninteresting sauce, puree thing underneath. We also had a salad which was tasty, but once again, very minimal with almost undetectable featured mushrooms. Additionally, they have a bread selection each day that comes with special butters or spreads, our choice included a garlic spread that neither one of us liked. All of the selections were perfectly prepared and seemed to be of extremely high quality ingredients, I just didn't appreciate all of the taste parings, nor did I feel that the pricing was in line with the offerings. Did I mention that our glasses of wine were $15 each. It may seen that I am a penny pincher, but nothing could be further from the truth. Â All in all, I was disappointed in the whole experience as the restaurant had come highly recommended by a friend and my expectations were high. Been there, done that and don't have to do that again!"
"Just had another amazing dinner at Girl & The Goat. Â It was so good that I decided to overcome my reticence to write a review (there are plenty), but couldn't withhold my enthusiasm any longer. Â Overall, the flavors are both rich and complex. Â The Pig Face exemplifies both, and is likely the signature dish. Â The Roasted Cauliflower is moist and delectable... 2nd best vegetable dish I've ever had. Â We were surprisingly delighted by the Duck Tongue. Â Lastly, the Sticky Date Cake with blueberries and montamore cheese gelato is delicious. Â The atmosphere is lively, customers happy, and staff obviously enthusiastic about their restaurant/food/job. Â This is contagious, and makes a big difference. Â I, like thousands before me, highly recommend this place."
"Finally. Finally the day arrived. After making our reservation back in March, our 10:45pm table in June was ready. Is the wait ridiculous? Yes, of course it is. You definitely can't decide to go here the day of and expect to get a table (unless you wait in line right when they open and snag a seat at the bar). I starved myself all day so I could eat all the deliciousness I could. Sadly, it' wasn't enough.To start off, we ordered the pan friend shishito peppers as a ""snack"". There were a ton in the bowl, and we were too full to finish them throughout our meal. The peppers had a mild kick, which paired nicely to the nuttiness of the parmesan and the saltiness of the miso. I wish they would have been spicier though. Our waitress said that about 1/10 is spicy, so to be careful. It's like Russian Roulette with peppers. Next, I ordered the chickpea fritters and the garlic potato wontons, two of the most popular vegetarian entrees according to our waitress. My date ordered the halibut and the goat empanadas. Unfortunately, one of the hazards of coming a bit late is that the kitchen may not have everything in stock. Sadly, this was true of the halibut, and he ordered the scallops instead.The chickpea fritters blew my mind. The two fritters had a delightful crispy exterior that perfectly contrasted their completely smooth inside. They were accompanied by mushrooms, okra-tomato relish, mushroom aioli and roasted chickpeas. Even though I hate okra, these were delicious. Each component of the dish worked well with everything else. However, towards the end the richness gets to you and it becomes a bit hard to eat. The garlic potato wontons were amazing as well. The broth had an almost silky texture that accompanied the ramps, spiced pecans, mushrooms and wontons well. I wish there was a bit more garlic flavor in the wontons, but it was delicious nonetheless.My date loved his empanadas, and was split on his scallops. He loved the scallops, didn't like the kimchi that accompanied it. Me being a lover of kimchi, thought he was ridiculous and tried it. Holy balls of vinegar was that tart. It was way too sour/vinegary for my taste.Now, here comes the best part of the meal-the dessert. We ordered the goat cheese bavarois. I'm a huge fan of goat cheese in dessert, and I think it's tart, tangy flavor provides contrast to the sweetness of everything else. Make sure you go straight down with a spoon and get all four layers-the cool blueberry compote, the brown sugar cake, the goat cheese cream, and the salted caramel crispies. Holy moly. I have no other words to describe this, other than it was probably one of the best desserts I have ever had. This is a must-go place in Chicago. The food is excellent. The ambiance is a bit weird though. The music is way too loud, and you have to shout across the table to whoever you're with. Also, the music selection is weird. One second you have a calming indie song on the radio, next it's some heavy rap song. It's very odd. But if the food keeps being this amazing, I'll ignore the deafening noise and come back :)"
I really enjoyed my meal here. Â HIghlights were lamb tartare...and the delicious woodsmoke smell.Great bev service. I'm not really one for repeating restaurants in cities I don't frequent but I would 100% return to this joint the next time I'm up in Chicago.
"On a whim I decided to have Â a pre-restaurant week warm up at Girl and the Goat. Â It happened completely on a whim as I got back pretty hungry and didn't know what I wanted to eat. Â I just went on Open table and kind of booked it. Â I had been meaning to try the place for a long time. Â There has to be something to being the only female chef to win Top Chef. Â From the moment I came in I was welcomed by very friendly staff. Â My waitress, Allison, was very helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Â The place has a comforting feel, brick walls and wood floors, very much give you that farm to table vibe. Â Everything on the menu looked tasty and intriguing at the same time. Â Immediately a few things jumped out at me. Â The kohlrabi salad for one. Â Kohlrabi is one of my favorite vegetables. Â It kinda tastes like broccoli. Â I never thought to try kohlrabi raw though. Â The thinly sliced relative of cabbage was had a tasty ginger dressing. Â Additional crunch came from almonds and the gooseberries gave a tart kick to it. Â Definitely my new favorite salad.For bread I had the stecca. Â The bread was grilled to be crisp without adding color. Â It was very tender on the inside. Â The genius part was serving it with a garlic aoli. Â The bread was as stellar as I expected, considering Izard also opened the Little Goat Bread. Â One thing that I loved was the fact that nearly every dish I had had a little bit of bacon in it."
"It wasn't as fantastic as you would think. or maybe I wasn't focusing on the food? I liked the vibe, and the dishes were nice but not superb. It was a nice date though haha"
"Why is this place getting 4+ star reviews? Â Unbelievable. Â The food here tastes a little like it's been ripped off from other cultures (i.e. Vietnamese) with a lot of fats preferred by American (like cream, butter, etc.) combined with salt. Â Just so much salt. Â All of our dishes came out incredibly salty. Â The servers couldn't give me enough water to counter the oversalted dishes. Â I came here with a party of 6 and we tried the vast majority of the menu. Â I am just unimpressed. Â Furthermore, I think every member of my six-person party walked out feeling like the food was sub-par and and incredibly salty. Â Skip it.I'm not even going to get into value or service since the food was so bad. Â I think this is the first time that I disagree with this many Yelpers. Â I definitely believe in the validity of Yelp; it almost (but not quite) makes me want to try this spot again."
"I had an amazing dinner with my friend Laura W. here and was lucky enough to get a week of reservation for 8:30. Girl & the Goat was my first stop after being picked up from the airport and really set an amazing tone for the week.The space is beautiful, like a high class gastropub, beautiful wood colors, dim lighting, and really spacious. The entire staff was friendly and helpful but the food of course was the true highlight of the evening.We tried three cocktails throughout the night: Best of Three, Four in the Same, and the Winter Negroni. We joked about threesomes and foursomes all night and hoped the other parties next to us found it endearing. But we definitely thought the Four in the Same was the best cocktail, refreshing, citrusy, slightly bitter, not too sweet. A really good drink for the meal ahead.We started off with one of the bread options that vary depending on the day called the aMAIZing and as corny as it was (giggle), it really was amazing. The bread was so fresh, so warm, and stuffed with a layer of gooey cheese and spinach. It would have been completely fine on its own but it was accompanied with two delicious sauces, a mole and an avocado creme fraiche. I could have just had this for my meal and been completely content.We moved on to one of the specials of the evening, a shrimp ceviche with Malaysian style chips. The flavors were harmonious, not too acidic, the shrimp superbly flavorful and fresh. It worked so well with the chips which had their own unique flavor. But my friend and I discovered that the ceviche was brought to an entirely new level when paired with a bit of the mole from the bread. That was heaven.We also got the roasted cauliflower which was simple yet good. I love the flavor cauliflower gets when roasted or fried already but this dish added a bit more complexity with its pickled peppers and cheese.We ended our savory journey with the confit goat belly, which is a small portion but extremely rich. Paired with lobster and crab that all have been basted and/or poached in the bourbon butter, you definitely couldn't have too much. The goat, lobster, and crab were all flavorful but I felt it was a bit too rich for my tastes. The fennel and microgreen salad however was the highlight giving that much needed levity and tart flavor to cut the heaviness of the dish.Wanting to leave off on a sweet note, we ordered the chocolate cake with thai-chili gelato. This dish had so many different textures and temperatures. The cake was rich, moist, and warm. The thai-chili gelato was chocolate based but not too spicy only leaving you with a subtle burn at the end. There were also pomegranate seeds and cocoa nibs for added crunch. There was even marshmallow fluff for sweetness and some milk stout to bring it all together. However, I felt there were way too many components in the dish and altogether, they were not necessarily harmonious. The stout was definitely lost from all the other stronger flavors and added to this odd lukewarm temperature in the dish. The flavors that stood out came from the cake, gelato, and marshmallow fluff. That said, we still finished it but I think it needed a bit more contrast or varied flavors given the amount of components.All in all, this was an amazing meal and definitely a spot I would come again when I come back to Chicago. And of course, it's always great to know that a Top Chef winner I like is doing well."
"Amazing! Â Well worth planning ahead a few months to get a table. Everything was perfect- the food, service and atmosphere. We started with the goat empanadas which were so good. There were many goat items and it was hard to choose. But I think we made a good choice. Next up was the cauliflower and the halibut. Ok this is going to sound weird but the cauliflower was one of the best dishes ever. Yes, I realize it's a vegetable...and not even an exciting one. We are really hoping this recipe is in Stephanie's cookbook. The halibut was also tasty- cooked perfectly. Next was the pig cheek with egg. Yum..crispy and delicious! Â That was really enough food, but Rob Lowe walked in so we needed to order more so I could stare longer. We opted for the pork shank. So good- crispy and moist at the same time, and served with flavorful sauces. The wine list was excellent including some rare bottles and all prices. We found an Outpost Grenache which is not easy to come by. All in all, I'd plan a trip to Chicago again just to go here!FYI, check out the hidden champagne lounge around the corner on Green for a pre or post dinner drink. Follow the small white lights down the alley."
"We were able to try out this place without reservation at 4:30pm. Service was great and the menu is unique. Grilled baby octopus - good, too saltly for my tasteOrdered two bread types - both are deliciousPork shank - goodpig face - very unique, just not for me. Too gelatinous and plain.both type of Oyster dishes - were delicious according to my familywood grilled broccoli - nothing special, too salty for megrilled skirt steak - i enjoyed this dishoverall, I recommend visiting the restaurant especially if you are from out of town like me. I dont think it will be a place to visit very often if i live nearby due to the price vs food quantity/quality."
"I didn't understand the popularity of this restaurant until I was at a Second City show and they made a joke calling out Girl & The Goat as a trendy, hip restaurant that is impossible to get a reservation. Lucky for me, my travel companion was able to snatch a reservation 2 weeks before our trip to Chicago on Open Table. I can only assume that some unlucky soul had a scheduling conflict that led them to give up such a covetable reservation. This was a restaurant that I went in with high expectations and in a rare instance, actually met and surpassed my expectations. The decor and setup of the restaurant was great and the environment felt very lively. The service I received here was easily in my top 5 experiences. Our waiter was excellent at listening to our taste preferences and offering up fantastic recommendations. Food:The Green Beans and Roasted Cauliflower both had great flavor. (We actually only ordered one but since Chicagoans are so nice, we ended up sharing with a table next to us). The Wood Fired Permaquid Oysters were small but delicious. Grilled oysters were a first for me and I definitely enjoyed them. The must-try dish for me was the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. The combination of pork, eggs, potato and cilantro was off the charts good. The Confit Goat Belly was another really good dish that I would recommend. Of the goat dishes, our waiter said the Goat Belly and Goat Empanadas were they most popular. The Empanadas were lackluster to me and didn't stand out as a signature dish for a restaurant of this quality.Overall, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend anyone living or traveling to Chicago to try out. Just make sure you have reservations and go in on an empty stomach. There is nothing like over-ordering at a tapas style restaurant when you're extremely hungry."
Hands down one of the best restaurants I gave ever eaten at. Absolutely worth all the hype. Stephanie was seen expediting orders must of the night. Here was what we had. (Dinner for two)Not Campbell's breadGoat empanadaCauliflowerDiver scallopsGoat belly (least favorite)Pig face (the best thing ever)Apple crumbleBittersweet brownie
"Quite simply the best meal during my recent trip to Chicago.The service is perfect: friendly, attentive, but never in your face or pushy.Everything we ate was delicious, five different dishes and all were fantastic. We skipped lunch that day and went in for an early dinner on the patio and I'm glad we did because every bite was worth it. The drinks were good but not to die for, but I won't fault them for that, I only tried two cocktails and my second choice was a tequila drink and not something I normally prefer but I went for it just to try a broad selection of drinks. I would definitely return if I find myself in Chicago again (and I'd make reservations ahead of time to experience the inside dining)."
Came here for our anniversary and it was the best decision ever. Â Awesome and unique food. Friendly staff. Loved the environment. Try to get the seats right at the kitchen. We got to sample a few things the chefs were making.
"i finally got to try this now famous chicago place after waiting 6 months for reservations, I ended up dropping over $60 here and I was still hungry, the food isnt bad but the portions are all so small, if you go in a group to split dishes like youre supposed to, you barely get a bite of anything, and you have to spend like $500 to actually get full, a big ripoff in my opinion"
Interesting choices. Â Created well. Â Cooked perfectly. Â Seasoned deliciously. Â Served with great attitude. Â I loved this meal at the bar. Â One of the best meals in my dining experiences.
"GATG was a must on my most recent trip to Chi-town, but I didn't make reservations. My friend assured me if we went when they open (4:30pm), we should be fine. Turns out she was right; our party of four was seated almost immediately.First of all, the look and feel of the restaurant is cool: clean, hip, and bustling, yet not obnoxiously loud. Service is impeccable. Our server Jess was fun, attentive and helpful. And it doesn't hurt to come here with someone who eats here seemingly every week, as she knows what to recommend (even though as I'll say later, you probably can't go wrong with anything here).Because we were planning on hitting Avec right after our meal at GATG (I know, I know, what can I say... our trip was short and we had to hit as many places as we could), we had to somewhat limit our selection. Of the things we ordered, the green beans and Brussel sprouts were great (that's right, I said BRUSSEL SPROUTS); the Crudo, Goat belly, Pig face and Sugo were good; and the Goat Carpaccio was my favorite of them all. I will say the dishes were on the salty side, but with that also comes some outstanding flavors. Though I haven't tried everything here, I think it's safe to say you'll be fine going with any of the dishes."
"It's such a solid 4.5 in my book... When is Yelp coming out with half stars? Candice, who do I talk to about this?Here's the pros and cons and my final reasoning on why I went with 4.Pros:- Chef's Table: Sitting at the chef's table was an amazing experience that I am very thankful for. At first, when they told us that we were sitting in front of the kitchen, I thought it was just because they didn't have room anywhere else. But after getting to see the chefs in action the whole night, a free entree (Goat Empanada: Amazingly soft for a shredded meat and the romesco + cream cheese works wonders in your mouth), and a free dessert (Date Cake: kind of funky but I was amazed that they were able to make a gelato with a cheese. It was a little too savory for my taste but it worked well with the very sweet blueberries. Plus, am I really going to complain about a free dish?), I realized that we really had a seat reserved for VIPs.- Roasted Cauliflower: I'm as amazed as you are that I'm about to say this but this may have been my favorite dish of the night (very close race with the Goat Empanada mentioned above). Yes, a vegetable dish. The perfect amount of oil and butter, the crispiness of the cauliflower, and a hint of mint make this a great dish to start with.- Bittersweet Chocolate: A mushroom gelato? Yes! It worked amazingly well with the bittersweet ""brownie."" The combination somehow made the chocolate AND the gelato sweeter.Cons:Now let me be clear, these dishes were not horrendous. It has more to do with the fact that the dishes had a small flaw that couldn't be overlooked or hindered me from fully enjoying the dish.- Confit Goat: Although the flavors were delicious, it was just too much softness. Soft goat meat with soft crab with soft lobster with soft fennel butter... I'm not in the retirement home yet.- Diver Scallops: Just a little too salty to eat the dish comfortably. The scallops already had too much salt on them but the kimchi they added to the dish just made it saltier. The avocado balanced it out somewhat but there's only so much 4 slices of avocado can do.- Grilled Baby Octopus: The octopus is cooked to perfection: soft but a little chewy so your mouth can get some exercise. The only complaint with this dish was that it had a little too much lemon for my taste. But I must admit that the dish grew on me as I ate more and more.- Pig Face: Ahhh, finally got to try the dish with all the hype. I must say I was a little disappointed... Was it because of the hype? I don't know. But the whole thing was just a little too sweet to be an entree. All 3 sauces on the outside were sweet PLUS the Potato Stix seemed more like Sugar Stix. The pork was cooked to perfection and who doesn't like an egg on top of their dishes? But it was just too much sweet, not enough savory.Now some may look at these ""cons"" and think it's not enough to lower it to a 4. But I guess since it's my review, I can do what I want! Remember, I said it was a 4.5 before, but I just had to rate it a 4 because of Yelp's unbelief in halves. I will definitely be returning... Now to see when I can actually get a reservation..."
"It's a very nice, comfortable restaurant. Â We had the crudo, the peppers, the sogu (pasta with kind of shredded pork), the beet salad, the goat empanadas, and the miso butter bread and then the butterscotch miso dessert. Â My favorite was the goat empanadas. Â Maybe the peppers weren't as complex as other things but they were tasty and fun to eat and reminded me of the ones I eat all the time in spain. Â The waiter was very honest about what he preferred and that's a little surprising."
"Everyone knows the food is fantastic here so I am going to focus my review on the service associates.Preface- I came on a Monday just after 5pm with one other person. 1) Super Pretentious Douchey Host - Â When greeted by the host he asked ""How are you?"" I responded with the usual ""Fine, thank you. you?"" upon which he responded ""Better than you are."" Which was strange to me but that wasn't the worst of it. After asking if we had reservations (which we didn't) he said ""We'll then, you only have 1 hour and thirty minutes to dine, then I will need the table back."" As popular as this place is and I understand trying to honor reservations, that is simply a faux pas. After telling this story to my neighbors, who are both chefs in the Chicago area, they said it's a total ""Dee Eye Cee Kay"" move. 2) Jess, our fantastic server... Had a down to earth, warm and inviting personality. She was also extremely knowledgeable about the menu and the cuisine. Without her, our experience would not have been that great. 3) Creepy, Corpulent, Blonde Women who walks around staring at the tables and taking notes - I gather she is some kind of traffic manager trying to see what tables are opening soon, etc... But I noticed her enough times that her presence felt invasive and almost as if were being rushed out.Overall Food - 5Service - 3 and obvious room for improvement"
"Honestly, I was underwhelmed by the food here. Yes, the pig face, duck tongue, and escargot ravioli were all very good, but they didn't blow me away. For being the #1 restaurant in Chicago on Yelp, it really didn't live up to the hype. I'm rounding up to a 4 stars on account of the food, but waiting two months for a late Saturday night reservation probably brings this down to 3.5 stars, let alone the over-hyped factor.We made another reservation (for mid-October!) just so we could try the goat leg. Maybe I'll get wow'd by that? We'll see..."
"Please do me one favor, BELIEVE ALL THE HYPE! This place is such a gem. Its a culinary experience you are not going to want to miss. Two words, Pig Face! Chicago is such a great city with a lot of amazing establishments but this place is one you can not miss. Be advised, make your reservation months in advance to make sure you get in, its that busy. However this outrageous busy-ness does not take away from food quality or service. This is one of those places you have to put on your culinary bucket list. Cant wait to go back!"
"At this price, the food was gorgeous. Â We have excellent service. Â We had a reservation at 9:30 and was seated by about 9:40 which isn't too bad. Â The quality of the food totally blew me and my wife away."
"We had a group of 8 and had made a reservation 3 months ahead of time for our party on a Thursday night. We got there a few minutes early and it was already packed solid. A very good sign. Service was very appropriately attentive with great suggestions and guidance for our first time at the restaurant. Goat leg was perfect amount of food to allow some room for additional plates to sample. Tender flavorful and plentiful. SautÃ©ed green beans, roasted cauliflower, beet salad, kohlrabi salad. All excellent. Trout tartare was excellent. We were stuffed!Overall excellent meal, reasonable pricing and superb service. Tips: small plates aren't really that small so consider making multiple rounds of orders to avoid waste. Book ahead early!Only one critique-some of the dishes in my opinion could have been done with less salt. That's pretty much just this guy's opinion so take it for what it's worth. Overall a great time!!!"
"Ok. I was prepared to dislike this place. Â My friend made a reservation months in advance which was just ridiculous to me. I don't wait months to eat anyone's food. When I arrived it was the typical West Loop restaurant - a mix of fancy hipness filled with pretty, high-credit-lined white people who are sexy and they know it.Thankfully, no one around me ordered the pig-face entree or I may have fainted at the table and choked on on my own vomit. Â  Here's my take away. Â The vegetable dishes are some of the best I have ever had. Â I admit it. Unbelievable. Â I have never tasted cauliflower or broccoli like this. Â Remarkable. Â You have to try the cauliflower. You'll be like, 'WHAT THE ?!?!?"" Â So good. Â  So even if you are there to eat the dead animal flesh, I strongly urge you to add the cauliflower to the mix. Â It will be like someone just reinvented vegetables for you. Â Of course, I'm sure they've accomplished this by pouring butter and/or oils all Â over them. I also noted that the veggie portions were much larger than the meat entrees. Â I ended up getting full and I fully expected to leave hungry since this was not a vegetarian restaurant. Â I didn't expect that I would leave satisfied. Â Ironically, I remember my days as a meat eater and I would have had to order quite a lot of those plates to be full. Â They were tiny. Â My only wish is that some of my vegetable plates had come out together. Â Being able to eat a little from each at the same time would have been better.So would I go back? Â Yes and no. Â I wouldn't mind going back - Â but I really won't wait weeks or months for a table so the chances are slim. Â But that's not to say I wasn't impressed by what this chef did with veggies. Â  Â Oh one more thing -- the service was unbelievable. Â Some of the best I have ever had in Chicago. Â Attentive without ever being obtrusive. Â Helpful. Â Friendly. Â And the restaurant was so well staffed -- Â there were people everywhere, attending to everything. Â  They were on it. Â  Â Whoever manages this place should teach a master class on how to do it."
"I was able to get a last minute reservation on Wednesday at 10:45 p.m. Got there a little earlier and checked in. We then went to the bar to get some drinks before we got seated. They ended up seating us at 10:30 p.m., which was great. The place was crazy packed still at this time. I would say the food was decent, but I have had better. Â The oven roasted pig was delicious as people have raved about. My boyfriend thought the fried soft shell crab with corn was good too. Other than those two dishes, the food was just okay. Â It's worth coming here if you can get a reservation in advance. Service was friendly and my cup of water never went empty!"
"Finally got to hit up the much anticipated Girl and Goat. Since following Izzard on Top Chef, I was hoping all her training and exposure would yield great things.But to be honest, I still favor the chef's dishes at Scylla, pre-Top Chef."
"Oh my gosh does this place live up to the hype! While visiting in Chicago we had to go to the restaurant with over 3200 reviews and a rating of 4 1/2 stars! Every review I read was pretty much spot on. I could not get a reservation for the night I was looking for (somewhat last minute so I guess that's a good thing) Â and the wait was two hours so we waited behind a couple at the bar that looked like they were about to leave and took their seats after about 15 minutes of sipping on a cocktail. First thing to note was the bartenders were very attentive to even the people standing behind the bar. We were asked by two different people if we want to drink or to see the menu before we even sat down. The service at this restaurant is absolutely fabulous! As I said we ended up sitting at the bar and there were three different bartenders. Usually you only get one waiting on you. At this place all of them take care of you and all of them were equally fabulous. We asked the waiter for his recommendation on what to get for dinner. He told us one thing from each portion of the menu and we took his word for it and ordered each item. We got The sautÃ©ed green beans (really good), grilled sepia (amazing), grilled Kalbi beef ribs (oh my God spectacular!!!!!), Johnny applecheese bread (yummy), and goat carpaccio (we could take or leave this one) for dinner. For dessert we got the miso - butterscotch buDino and the bittersweet chocolate and they were both delicious. All in all the service and the food were amazing! I would have thought after four courses, two desserts and four top shelf drinks that the bill would have been ridiculous but we walked out only paying $160 and that included a generous tip. The restaurant is a bit loud so I wouldn't recommend it for a romantic dinner unless you could be assured you were on the patio which isn't that large. But if you want excellent food at pretty decent prices with the most amazing service, this is definitely the place to go."
"a friend was kind enough to give me her reservation, as i was visiting from out of town at the time. the restaurant is lovely. it's definitely got a cool modern feel to the rustic Â warmth that a fine wooden winery can bring. our server was attentive and a delight to have. when you're having to wait on 5 girls, it can be a bit of a challenge, but he was congenial and fun.it's fun to go with a small group so that you can order numerous plates and eat a little of everything. our table ordered:- corny goat (bread)- roasted beets- ham frites- wood oven roasted pig face- kona kampachi crudo- grilled baby octopus- confit goat belly- roasted cauliflower- sauteed green beans- some sort of braised/grilled meat (forgive me! i don't remember the name but i've included a picture)- miso-butterscotch budino.everything was delicious. i wasn't really feeling the bourbon butter in the confit goat belly, but everything else cooked to perfection. my favorite dish out of everything were the green beans. they were sauteed beautifully, and the there's a bit of a citrus kick that it has. all of the dishes were well-thought out, and i very much appreciated that there was a little acid to cut through each dish (ponzo, yuzu, pickled peppers.. etc). otherwise, with ingredients like goat belly, braised pork meat, and octopus, things can slowly get too rich without a little acid.make reservations early if possible, avoiding peak times. from what i hear, this place gets extremely busy and reservations need to be made days in advance."
"I've been to many of the top restaurants in Chicago and this place tops the list of the tops. If you don't like weird, exotic or different kinds of food than don't come here! This place isn't for the weak of stomach or the tight fisted budgeter. Yes, the plates are small and they are pricey. But seriously probably the best thing you will ever taste. The bread is crazy good. I heard from people that the bread was good, and kind of rolled my eyes because they were raving about bread. But yea, it's *that* good. I ate duck tongue, pigs face and goats neck and loved every bite! I cringed paying $15 for a glass of pinot noir, but the flavor and the robustness of the wine warranted every dollar. To the people complaining about salt--I did not find anything particularly salty. I am a very health conscious person and have a general aversion to salt. Go take a class at the Chopping Block and you will see that any ""fine dining"" meal will be FULL of salt, butter and oil. Don't eat out if you don't like salt.This isn't somewhere you probably want to eat often, but you should want to go. Make the reservation now and in three months (that's how long it takes to get a reservation) you will be in for a treat. And that's what this place is, a treat.One thing I almost forgot to mention, which probably makes this place worth more than 5 stars is the fact they were OVER THE TOP accomodating to my food allergies. The server actually took the menu back to the chef and had them cross out every single thing on the menu I was allergic to and then she came back with a ""Sarah Customized Allergy Free"" menu. Wow. So impressed. My food allergies make it tough to eat out and often cause me anxiety. This was probably the nicest I've ever been treated eating out. :)"
"Delicious and fun! We dined on several unique dishes that were all excellently prepared. We started with escargot ravioli, followed by goat empanadas, Â then roasted pig face, and crispy pork shank. All were fantastic, but I was especially blown away by the goat empanadas. We were there at 10:15 on a Sunday night and this place was hopping, which I personally love, but can understand that it may not be a selling point for everyone. Girl & the Goat deserves all of it's 5 star ratings and hype!"
"The hype is real, people. This place is worth all of the acclaim, and definitely worth the wait. I had one of the top 3 best meals I've ever had, and that included the free cauliflower dish they brought us for seating us 30 minutes late (yes, cauliflower - and it was delicious!). I can't say enough good things about all of the food, including but not limited to: goat empanadas, chickpea fritters, and some delicious PB&J dessert whose name I cannot remember. Definitely try calling for a reservation if you can't get one online, that worked for us."
"Being a huge Top Chef and Stephanie Izard fan, I made reservations as soon as we had our flights booked to Chicago which was about 3 months in advance. The only res avail for a party of 3 was Thursday at 930pm. We checked in with the host and after waiting a few mins he comes to us and tells us there is a table avail. It's the best seat in the house but seats only 2 ppl, but if we didn't mind he could seat us there right away. We agreed to it not knowing what to expect. He walked us to the chef's table which is right where the food comes out. We had a full view of the kitchen and watched all the chef's in action. It truly was the best seat in the house and we were super excited to get started with our meal. Our server and the chef's were very accomodating and really interactive with us. They answered any questions we had and they were super entertaining. We started off with a bottle of wine and took 1 of the chef's recommendation and ordered the mushroom tomato bread. All their bread is baked in-house daily and this bread was amazing. It was a cheese bread with a mushroom butter and tomato sauce dipping. Basically a tomato bisque, in bread form. It was truly wonderful and def lead into an amazing dinner. My friends and I ordered the wood grilled broccoli, diver scallops, wood oven roasted pig face, braised beef tongue, beef short rib, and Hiramasa Crudo w/ crisp pork belly. Everything was really good but it was a tad bit on the saltier side. Usually if you sit at the chef's table, the chef's give you little tastings of stuff but according to our server, he said since we ordered so well, they decided to just give us a sampler of all their desserts. This was amazing. We got to try all 4 of the desserts they had on the menu. The dessert chef made us a sampler and it was a great tasting of each one. Overall, this was one of my favorite dining experiences. Sitting at the chef's table, interacting with the chefs, great food and company, it was a receipe for success. Only if Stephanie Izard was there, I would've diedddd!"
"I have been here two times so you are about to get a list of dishes that I tried each time. They change their menu every couple of months so some items may not be there anymore just FYI! I was afraid that this place wouldn't be able to live up to the hype, but it totally does! Stephanie Izard is AMAZING and the entire design of the restaurant it just beautiful. It looks like this high class restaurant with a beautiful wooden structure and intricate details. What is funny about it is that there are bunches of painted goats everywhere and it is just such an amazing place! The wait staff is absolutely amazing as well and they are so attentive. Know that you will be eating for a good 1.5-2 hours, but it is so worth it because they space out all the dishes perfectly. Now, here are the descriptions of the dishes that I had in my two visits!Not Campbells Bread: This was by far one of the most genius things I have ever tasted only because it was just bread and sauce! The freshly baked bread (they make it across the street) was paired with a mushroom butter and tomato oil. The mushroom butter tasted just like Cream of Mushroom Soup and the Tomato Oil, like Tomato soup. I could have just eaten the butter and tomato oil all night and for only $4, I highly recommend that you order this bread dish!Roasted Cauliflower: This was by far one of the best dishes and it shocked me how much I enjoyed it! The cauliflower was cooked with pickled peppers, mint and pine nuts and the cauliflower really absorbed the flavor of the broth that it was cooked. The pine nuts added a nice crunch to the dish as well!Escargot Ravioli: The ravioli was stuffed with escargot and bacon and then cooked in a tamarind-miso sauce and topped with fried onion straws. It was key to eat this dish with a bit of each component because the freshness of the escargot, with the saltiness of the bacon, the crunchiness of the onion straws and then the saltiness of the sauce, just made it an amazing bite. Confit Goat Belly: The goat belly was really tender and the plate was topped with bourbon butter. The goat was accompanied with lobster and crab and then topped with fennel for an added crunch. It wasn't my favorite dish of everything that we had, but I still like it. I wish that there was a bit more flavor in the butter or if there is another sauce. Pan Roasted Halibut: The halibut was cooked really nicely and was paired well with the shrimp pieces, white asparagus, ramps and grilled blueberries. I personally didn't taste any of the blueberries, but the broth that was in the fish, was comparable to that of the escargot ravioli. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: By far the most amazing dish of the night. When we researched on Yelp, this was the one dish that everyone recommended! The crispy pig face was mixed with tamarind, cilantro, red wine maple and potato stix. Then a sunny side egg was on top, and the way you eat this dish is to break up everything and mix it together. It was AMAZING! The pig face was super crisp and the potato stik enforced that extra crunch. The yolk was still a bit runny and all of the sauces heightened all of the flavors, that would have been a bit salty combined. Sticky Date Cake: The sticky date cake was served with seedling blueberry preserves and a side of monamore gelato. Then all of it was topped with two pizzelle cookie crisps.Culture Club-Fresh baked bread with a ramp butter and a garlic oil. I liked the bread I had from last time, but this one was still amazing.Green Garlic Potato Wontons-Wontons with a potato and garlic filling and then they were cooked in a broth with ramps, shitake mushrooms, asparagus, pickled rhubarb and spiced pecans. I really liked the wonton but I think that if you are going to get a vegetable, I would still get the roasted cauliflowerGoat Carpaccio-Thinly sliced goat, pounded down and topped with smoked trout roe, olive-maple vinaigrette, and field greens. Charred Pork Belly-Last time, I wasn't a huge fan of the goat belly so we tried the pork belly this time. AMAZING! It was so fatty and delicious and it was cooked with a tangy jus, and covered in spring onions and sunflower seeds. Literally melted in my mouth and we didn't speak for a couple of minutes cause we were just eating the entire time. Grilled Baby Octopus-Octopus was sauteed with romanos, lava beans, pistachios, lemon vinaigrette and bacon. The bacon is the best part of this dish because while everything else was smoky, and very strong in flavor, the bacon was almost sweet, balancing the entire dish!Diver Scallops-Perfectly cooked scallops with brown butter kimchee, hazelnut rapini and this all sits on top of a next of mashed avocado. Miso-Butterscotch Budino-Dessert goes to a different stomach and this was amazing and not too sweet! The budino was covered with bacon toffee, candied cashews, glazed pineapple pieces and a homemade whipped cream."
AMAZING! Go with people who are adventurous and are willing to try anything. I can't tell you what was the best but the lamb tartare is still stuck in my head as well as the sugo pasta. When you go listen to your waiter and order 7-8 different things to share for a party of four. It will make the experience so much better.
"I think by now everyone knows how great this place is, so another review is pretty redundant. I'll just mention 2 things:1) It's rare to find a place where the atmosphere, service, and food all exceed your expectations and leave you totally satisfied.2) The shishito peppers dish is incredible -- it was the highlight of our dinner."
"So, we tried it out finally. Since my expectation is so high after reading the Yelper's reviews and considering there is no dinner reservation available in weeks!All Asians watch out, you may not enjoy the Pork Face dish as much as your American friends. When I first taste it, I somehow recall a familiar Asian flavor that I tasted when I was young back in China......Maybe it's because the tradition in China that we eat all parts of the pig anyway, from the ear, face to the pig tail! So I'm not amazed by this so called famous dish.........Then it comes the Diver Scallops. Wow, it may be the best scallops I tasted so far! So so tender.When it comes to the drinks, the wine menu is massive.......I shall go for the wine instead of Martinis...Overall this is a great place to hang out with friends. However, I do not feel this is the restaurant that can be raved by others like 6 stars foodie place. Overrated a little bit."
"We had a wonderful meal and overall experience at G&TG. Â We got there early so we checked in and went next door to Nia for a drink, because there was no room at the bar to wait for 25 minutes.Decor is warm, inviting, intimate -- great date place I think. Â Loud but not annoying. Good friendly service - they explain everything before you order and are open to questions, and you never feel rushed. Â There were four of us and it took about 1.5 hours to get through 9 dinner plates, plus all four desserts. Â It seems like a lot of food but each of us got a couple bites per dish and we wanted to try as much as possible without being gluttons, by dish 7/8 we were starting to feel full. Â The waiter did suggest 2 plates per person.They bring out one dish at a time and do a really good job at pacing you. Â They saved roasted pig face for last -- I was most looking forward to this dish and I liked it, but it wasn't the standout. Â IMO the roasted cauliflower, roasted beet salad, beef tongue and grilled octopus were best. Â The duck fat butter with hot bread and celery relish was also amazing melt in your mouth delicious. Â The scallops themselves were perfect, but it was served something that tasted too vinegary and unnecessary with this dish. Â The green beans in the octopus dish were fantastic, and makes me want to try the green bean dish on my next visit. Â Chick pea fritters were fried perfectly with a slight crunch and smooth puree inside. Â The goat empanadas were very good too -- not gamey, almost creamy texture (like they added beans to the meat or something). Â Very good, would like to go back and try another 8 or so dishes.The desserts -- the bittersweet chocolate was good, there's shiitake in there and you can taste it. Â The grapefruit ice cream was refreshing and creamy and you keep getting little bits of crunch. Â Butterscotch was the stand out I think, really great and lots going on in that dish and the date cake was nice like bread pudding. Â Yum.They do ask you for any allergies prior to ordering -- there are a lot of nuts in these dishes. Â I assume they could omit anything you can't eat, and there are veggie options, but not sure about vegan.I also think it's important to mention we were pleasantly surprised with the bill. Â We each had drinks -- a couple a piece, and a total of 13 plates. Â I was expecting to spend around 300. or more, our bill was actually around 220. Â My husband guessed double that! Â I'd say around 50. a person with drink.The bathrooms are in the basement, and are unisex. Â So there are just a bunch of individual water closets lining the hallway -- it was confusing but cool, and SUPER clean and no musty smells which I would expect being underground.Valet is 10.00 or parking on the street is pay at the box for 4/hour."
"it was good..... but it was also not out of this world.. the best dish we like there was some appetizer that taste like thai green papaya meet hummus meet some deep friend item.. i think it was falafel with some cold salad stuff.. that is out of this world... i can't find the name of this dish at the current menu so i guess they don't have it anymoreand then the crispy pig face was also delicious.. but seriously how is crispy pig face plus egg not delicious.. the rest of the dishes are just meh.... :( a lil sad. Â i expected better. it's good but if everything is as strong as that one starter, ill be loving the restaurant more...one note please do NOT order the sishito pepper.. omg what is that dish.. like roasted sishito pepper plus loads and loads of cheese on top.. gross.............. we could not finish it, too heavy.... take out the cheese pls"
this place has become one of our favorite Chicago restaurants. Â The food is consistently delicious and inventive. Â We are a family of four and there is never any left over food. Â The menu changes and we love that there is always something new and flavorful to try.
We went to this restaurant for my friends bday. She manahed book thr reservation despite of high unavailability. Tried pig head which is their famous item. Liked it.
"There's something about being an out of towner that makes locals want to question your every decision. Whether it's flying into the wrong airport, staying at the second best hotel or grabbing coffee at the sucky coffeehouse, there's always something you could have done better if only you had the eternal wisdom of a local. When answering the hoards of locals waiting to scrutinize your dinner choice, I found that there is no better response than telling people that you're coming here. Stopped dead in their tracks, they look at you with stares of unending admiration and amazement. Instead of being lectured on where I should have gone, all I heard was ""How did you get a resie?"" followed quickly by ""Can I come?""Our party was sufficiently full and satisfied when we hit the halfway mark, but we battled on, firm believers in the No Plate Left Behind policy. Not to be overshadowed, our server was the best kind of witty, quirky and overwhelmingly adorable; she restored my faith in Midwesteners in a matter of minutes. Start to finish, Girl & The Goat was the smartest decision this non-local could have made."
magical food in a magical place
"Im sure this place has tons of 5 stars. Just adding mine to the numbers it's racking up. Went there for D's birthday. Honestly, the first thing that hit me was the smell. Bacon mmmmmmmmmmm.... but yes, I did leave smelling of pork. The place itself is nice. Down to earth, lots of wood, intelligent staff. Who are happy to make recommendations for you. My personal recommendations: - the chorizo flatbread- crispy duck- baby chicken- chickpea fritters- braised beef tongueall the food was really well prepared, unique, with thought given to the ingredients. You cant really go wrong here, but I would say that the one dish I didn't appreciate was the beet salad. And that's sad cos I love my beets."
"I made reservations for Girl & the Goat almost 3 months in advance and was stuck with a 9:30 PM reservation on a Sunday. Unfortunately the evening started out with trusty ol' Google Maps leading us through the most ghetto street ever to get here but once we arrived we were welcomed by the sleek, dark interior and a buzzing crowd. I wish we hadn't stuffed ourselves with a deep dish only a few hours back but I was determined to order at least a few dishes to see what the hype was all about.We were seated right away and although we had to wait quite a while for our wonderful waiter (from my hometown -whattup!), he was sincerely apologetic and was attentive for the rest of the evening. I explained that we were not too hungry and he suggested to start with 3 dishes which was more than enough. He even took the liberty to star the dishes that would take a while to make, and put exclamation points next to the more popular dishes. In the end we went with Pig Face (wow this thing is crack. From the runny yolk to the crunchy potato stix, to the absolutely amazingly seasoned pork), grilled baby octopus (pretty good - a little heavy on the vinaigrette), and the chickpea fritters (the mozzarella was bomb). The dishes (a little larger than tapas) were all interesting and fresh. Wish we had gotten one of the bread dishes as that seemed to be a fave amongst our fellow diners.P.S. I love the bathrooms here! Each stall is a private room that is legit bigger than many apartments in New York."
"What's there to say that hasn't already been said? Â Well, since I'm not going to look through the 2000 reviews to find out, I will say two things:1. Â Everything is delicious, well-balanced, and interesting. Â The chickpea fritters are amazing and the confit goat belly blew my mind. Â You're going to order a few dishes, and these two should definitely be some of them. Â 2. Â If you happen to be lucky enough to sit at the counter overlooking the kitchen, talk to the chefs. Â Ask them questions. Â Ask if you can sample whatever they're making. Â Ask them where they went to culinary school. Â Ask what their favorite restaurants in the city are. Â They like it. Â And if they like you enough, they might just treat you to their entire dessert menu ;)"
"We were sat 20 minutes late for our reservation, but they comped us an appetizer to make up for it. Â Awesome. Â Unfortunately, the awesome ended there. Reading the menu made my mouth water, but execution was sincerely lacking.I'll try to spare you an exhaustive analysis of each of the six dishes we ordered and try to summarize the main points that Girl and the Goat fails at:1. Portion sizes. Â The main entrees were kind of paltry, but the veggie dishes were insurmountable. Â It's like they were aiming to make every customer feel like Goldilocks and the Three Bears.2. Generally over-doing it. Â Most of their dishes have WAY too many ingredients. Â If I hadn't been the one who ordered, I wouldn't have known what we were supposed to be eating. Â This might not be so bad if it weren't for their final, and most grievous error...3. Poor ratio control within dishes. Â I'm going to illustrate with one specific dish: the braised beef tongue. Â This one would have been amazing, but it was like 90% masa (dough crisps). Â There were like three tiny pieces of tongue in it. Â I've looked at pictures of other people's serving of this dish and it looks much better apportioned than ours did.I really think this restaurant could have impressed me, but clearly the chefs are inconsistent and lack attention to detail. Â Stephanie Izard can't cook for everyone."
"Just perfect! Girl & the Goat is a must go if you are visiting Chicago! Excellent food, service and atmosphere!"
"My husband and I were extremely excited to try Girl and the Goat last Friday while vacationing in Chicago. I must say we were a bit disappointed. The food is quite heavy without many Â options for fresh flavors. We enjoyed the lamb belly and the parpadelle al sugo the most. They were delicious. The ham frites were great at first but we had to stop eating the fries as they were incredibly greasy and it was pretty much like eating salty oil after a few bites. The goat pÃ¢tÃ© was delicious but it was paired strangely with crumpets, a toasted baguette or country bread undoubtedly would have been a better pairing. The cocktails were nice and the restaurant it self is lovely and bustling but I wish I'd have gone elsewhere for dinner."
"Our first dining experience at G&G, and we were treated like rock starts. Â We got a kitchen table to start with, had a fantastic and knowledgeable server, Jill, on top of it. Â What we had:Thai bread: really nice with spicy chilies throughout. Â Hummus that comes with it was incredible!Oysters: raw in a light fruit-ish vinaigrette--very tasty but kind of small and compared to other dishes not the best we had. Â Still, if you like oysters, it was a really fun preparation.Chickpea fritters: Oh . . . my Â . . . goodness! Â So freaking delicious. I wanted to tell the chef to pull it from the menu so I could take the rest home with me. Kampachi crudo: the most tender crudo I've had since Arami. Â Really nice job with the spices and the fun pork-belly topping.Goat Loin w/ buttered cabage: words fail me to describe how delicious this was! Â It was like the tastiest tricked out not-corned beef and cabbage right before St. Patty's day.Date cake: heavenly, and it comes with Black Dog Gelato!!!Great menu, fantastic service, wonderfully executed everything!"
"Good but not sure I understand the hype.menu is for sure uniquethe oganic items are a plus for sureExecution was OK, not great.too many sauces on the food- NEGATIVEService was outstanding so kudos to themAtmosphere is fundidnt like the community table seating (sitting with strangers) service was a 4decor was a 4food was a 3seating 2I am rounding up here for the score but on this day the food was the weakest part for me. I came here to eat...and will be back because its a fun place."
"Reservations made three months in advance, dark low-key atmosphere with a terrifying painting, wonderful if inaudible wait staff - Girl and the Goat is everything you expect from this part of the city. But how was the FOOD? Here are all the dishes we had that night, ranked:(9) Mushroom Ragout: This was my least favorite dish, mostly because I hate mushrooms. Actually, entirely because of that. The sauce was earthy and bitter and the accompanying sweet potato agnolotti was excellent, but there was no mushroom revelation. They were mushrooms.(8) Roasted Beets: My first time having beets (what?), I'm going into this dish with no comparison. I found the beets, when eaten alone, to be somewhat flavorless and boring. Luckily they weren't alone though, because the vegetables and anchovies provided just the right amount of crisp, bracing flavor and crunchy texture. Still, while the whole was better than the sum of its parts, the beets are still #8.(7) Fried Oysters: Deep-fried and placed on individual spoons with a creamy white sauce (argh what was in it?), the fried oysters were absolutely delicious, tangy and slightly crunchy without overpowering the oyster flavor or texture. I only wish there were more. (6) Tempura Loup de Mer Filet: Delicate and flavorful with a delicious ""tuna crema"" that we just mopped up. The loup de mer was reminiscent of traditional fish and tartar sauce, but so much better. Like, fish and tartar sauce on the moon. (5) Rye Bread: Served with a very light salmon spread and pickled vegetables, the opening dish of the night let us know we were in for bold, surprising and playful flavors.(4) Steamed West Coast Mussels: The mussels themselves were perfect, converting even my fish-scared wife to the glory of mussels. But the squash, garlic and perilla (an herb) created a perfect pot of wild grown flavors and beautiful consistency.(3) Chickpea Fritters: What did they do to these? How did you turn your chickpeas into some sort of velvety tofu cheese creation, stable yet like a perfect pillow? And what demon did you sell your soul to when you came up with the idea of adding apple-tomatillo and prairie fruits chevre?(2) Grilled Baby Octopus: The variety in this dish was wonderful. The surprisingly smoky octopus legs combined with the rich vegetables & nuts and the slightly sour broth with the salty bacon made something absolutely extraordinary. This dish would be number 1 if it weren't for those pesky...(1) Goat Empanadas: I can never eat goat again. The tenderest, meltiest goat meat I've had this side of Mongolia is packed into a fried dough ball, and all is right with the world. It's something that seems like I could get on a street corner in Peru and yet it that takes impeccable skill and expertise. Forget the cream cheese (?) and salsa that came with it and just dig in."
"After a 3 month wait to get a table, I was going to eat at this restaurant with a slightly critical mind. Â We ate here on a Sunday evening and the place was really energetic and full. Â We were seated at our table immediately. Â The service was excellent. Â We didn't feel pressured to eat quickly or given any impression that our table was needed by a certain time.The food was out of this world. Â We had several dishes, including the house made bread with butter and cheese dips, ribs, ham frites, cauliflower and donuts for dessert. Â Every bite was amazing. Â The chef is truly an artist with food. Â The food wasn't so creative that you didn't know what you were eating. Â The price was very reasonable considering the enjoyable night we had - $102 for two of us and we ate a lot and had a couple of glasses of wine each. I was so impressed, I have already booked our next visit."
"This restaurant definitely themes around this girl and her goat: the interior, like Jay-Z said, is all black everything with only a hanging picture of a Tim Burton-esque picture of said girl and goat. At first glance, it seems that only Jack Skellington would want to be part of this creepy duo, after having dinner here,... I want to become their best friend! Such a fan!Here are some tips for your trip here:-Definitely make a reservation-- probably one of the most popular restaurants I've been to so far! Don't let your laziness ruin your chances of eating here!-Anything and everything from the menu is good. I don't really remember all that we ordered, but even the veggies were good (seriously, what do they lace that cauliflower with!?) Â I think one of my favorite dishes were one of the livers (beef?)-- my friend ordered it and, though I don't like liver at all, this was delicious.-I would recommend to order a lot of the goat, which can often be prepared horribly at other restaurants. Honestly, when you go to a restaurant named after a certain animal, you know they do it right.-Go with a lot of people: tapas-styped small plates means that, if you go with only 1 or 2 other people, you won't be able to try everything on the menu... unless you go with a bigger party. -$25 cork fee, but worth it because each glass of wine here is $$$$ probably.I won't be offended if you stop reading and make a reservation now :)"
"Probably the most hyped place in Chicago, for the most part justifiably. Â Let's start with the bad. Â Goat use to be better, its a 4 now use to be a 5. Â I go once a year, and it has definitely fallen as Stephanie has gotten busier in other projects. My first time dining there sitting at the kitchen counter for 2 with Stephanie 5 feet away expediting is still one of my all time favorite meals. Every dish was a hit. Â Now you find a miss here and there. Â The other annoying part is that you just can't get reservations. Â You either have to come at 430 or walk in at the bar. I've gotten lucky a couple of big holiday weekends, but with so many Chicago options, the hassle of getting in if you have been here a couple times almost makes it not worth doing. Â As for the good, just try the food. Not going to visually stun you but the taste will knock you over. Fun yummy comfort food with a twist. Every bread I've had is killer, duck tongues are a must have, and of course anything with goat. Â The alcohol program is strong, great cocktails and solid beer. You're going to find a Three Floyds on draft among other choices. Â However, please stop making beers with Haymarket, none are good. Â Its always loud and crowded, which for me is kind of annoying. Go with a crowd and enjoy, not a date spot for 2. Â Service is nice and bubbly, not going to blow you over. Â If you get lucky sure head out, but don't kill yourself trying to get a reso. Â Additionally, if you're set on the Goat and from out of town, go to the Goat, don't settle for Little Goat. Â It pails in comparison and you won't get the full experience of what Izard offers."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago! Â I've been four times, and it's one of the few places that lives up to the hype. Â I can't wait to go again, but unfortunately, the next weekend reservation I could get when I called two weeks ago is in May. Â Yep, it's January and my next confirmed visit is in May. Â The menu changes seasonally, but my favorite dishes have been the pork spare ribs (lots of meat, and it falls right off the bone), the green beans with cashews Â the cauliflower, and the sugo. Â The last three dishes I mention appear to be staples as they have been on the menu every time I dined at Girl and the Goat. Â I also highly recommend choosing one of the artisan breads to start your meal. Â The bread menu changes frequently, but I've never been disappointed. Â Finally, the orange sorbet dessert, when it's on the menu, is excellent.If you are a party of two, I also recommend requesting a chef's table. Â There are two-tops that open onto the kitchen. Â It's fun to watch the food preparation, and on one visit, we essentially tried half the menu as the chefs gave us samples of their favorite dishes!Finally, I cannot say enough about Stephanie Izard. Â She has been at the restaurant, working hard, every time I've visited. Â She is gracious, always taking time to pose for photographs! Â I cannot wait to return to the Girl and the Goat and may take others' advice on Yelp to walk-in early (like 4:30) to snag a table!"
"I have gone back and forth on how to review this place since our visit the other night. I think part of what I'm struggling with is expectations versus reality. Without a doubt, the food is above average-- if I were reviewing on food alone I would probably give Girl and The Goat 4 stars. We tried several dishes and everything was tasty and well prepared. My complaint would be that it felt like everything had the same basic flavor profile and was very fatty. My larger issue was with the environment. The restaurant is extremely loud and the tables are VERY close together-- forget about any kind of private conversation. Whole we knew this was a hot place and to expect a crowd, I think our problem was that the menu and the environment were kind of disconnected. The menu is absolutely fine dining but the environment is not. Take out one table per run, turn down the music two notches, and you would have something closer to a fine dining experience. Service was very nice overall though, again, there were a couple of small misses. This is a small plates restaurant but our eating plates were not regularly replaced-- meaning you end up eating all those flavors together as each new dish comes out. In general, we enjoyed it-- it's definitely worth one trip. Â I just don't know that I will go out of my way to make a second trip."
Great food!!! Great waiters.
"On this trip, we realized ""New American"" cuisine really got a deep hold of Chicago. Â After research, we determined it came down to a battle between Girl & The Goat and The Purple Pig. Â After trying both restaurants, Girl & The Goat wins, no contest. Food: 5/5- The food is DELICIOUS here. Â We tried the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face (best dish of the night), Escargot Ravioli (good, but not amazing), ham frites (great, hard to mess up fries). Â Add to that a great beer selection (they serve Allagash White, my fav) and I walked out thinking, ""Wow, that was an awesome meal.""Service: 5/5- We didn't want to wait so we sat at the bar. Â I'm glad we did because our server/bartender was very nice. Â She explained the menu to us, recommended different drinks for my S.O. and overall made us feel very comfortable. Â Environment: 5/5- This place has everything you want in your typical hipster joint. Â It's dark, cool, unique, and an open kitchen so you can see what's going on in the back.Value: 3/5- The portions are on the smaller size and the prices are high for the ingredients they use. Â Return? Â Yes, when I get to visit the Windy City again. Â This place is the holy grail of ""affordable"" new american food."
"Avec 1, G&TG 0.That is the verdict for the first head to head after I tried many dishes from both restaurants in three days. Â These are arguably the two hottest small-plate-based restaurants in Chicagoland right now, and fortunately I had a chance to dine in at both Avec and G&TG. Â Here are the dishes I had. Â (While we were waiting for a table (45 min wait on 6pm, Monday... Crazy...), my wife got 4 in the Same (Grey Goose . Aperol . Lemon . Green Chartruese). Â She said it was a bit sour, but I wouldn't comment because I can't taste good cocktail anyway.). Â My SIL got a couple of glasses of beer, which they thought were good.Now, really, here are the dishes we've got.1. Busta Rye (bread with thousand island and mustard seed butter, I think)- so so bread, but the sauces were quite good. Â Worth a try, even though it was weird they even charged for the bread.2. hen of the woods mushroom ragout Â (sweet potato agnolotti . shroom creme fraiche . capers)- Best dish of the day. Â Maybe I like everything sweet, but to me this dish had the perfect sweetness. Â Almost wow for me.3. Sauteed Skate sunchoke, ruby red grapefruit, olive, crisp lentils.- another great dish for me. Â The fish was perfectly cooked. 4. Diver Scallops squash, bok choy, goat xo, pizza poofs.- The price was a bit stiff (16 bucks for 2 pieces), but it tasted good.5. Chickpea Fritters stewed chickpeas, pickles, red onion, crave brother's mozzarella- I thought this one wasn't bad, but the fritter was a bit bland6. Â Braised Beef Tongue masa, beef vinaigrette, salsa verde.- I thought it tasted like not-well-executed mexican food. Â Wasn't that tasty, and it was a bit too much to eat.7. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato stix.- A lot of people raved about this one, but I didn't buy it. Â The meat didn't have the spark to mingle every ingredient in the dish. Â Also, the meat was too mushy and bland. Â 8. Kalbi Style Beef Ribs grilled sweet potatoes, charred okra- I just thought this wasn't good. Â tasted like they stopped marinating the meat and didn't finish it. Â However, my wife and SIL loved it, so it's all relative. So, at the end of our dinner, I felt like I had a good meal at Avec more than I did at G&TG. Â I thought Avec had more exciting mix of ingredients, and the better presentation, too. Â Still I generally liked the food and the lively ambiance, so I will try them again. Â It will be interesting to see whether my opinion will change in the next head to head between Avec and G&TG. Â By the way, I think this place is a bit overrrated. Â Maybe my expectation was way too high."
"they were great with my allergies and celiac. everything was labeled on the menu, which made me feeling more confident about ordering. the beet salad was delicious as was the bread. true celiac options were limited, but I left satisfied."
"This is one of the best meals I've ever had. It was a thrill to eat at the restaurant of a Top Chef winner, and both the food and the service were incredible. Although the place is known for its roasted goat (which was superb), I think this is one of the few places where I could have an all-vegetarian meal and not be disappointed. Bring a bunch of friends and share as many small plates as possible. The roasted cauliflower, the fried shisito peppers, and the sautÃ©ed string beans were my personal favorites. The waitstaff was also superb. I can't wait to go back!"
This place is exceptional! Â I went there on a Sunday evening and got the last seats at the bar. Â The bartender was so knowledgeable about the food. Everything I tried was orgasmic. My date and I got a bottle of wine and 5 plates and all in was $160 with a 25% tip. Â This is my favorite spot in the city.
"The restaurant was great! Â We did: Cauliflower, Arctic Char, Green Beans, Chicken, & Pig Face for two! Â Everything was super rich and filling but absolutely delish!"
"November 22, 2010. I remember this date- my first day of my current job and the day we (my new coworkers and I) were all so excited to try the Girl and the Goat. Â For a weeknight we had to take a 4:45 seating. It was the latest they would give us despite open tables well after 6 PM. The bread was warm, fresh and served with tasty spreads. The wine and cocktails were also good. I appreciated the local/seasonal ingredients, but couldn't get over that across all the dishes (pork, veggies, chicken) that they were over salted. UGH OVER SALTED!!!Desert was only partially redeeming - extremely (overly) sweet. Â Service was average, but pleasant. All in all this place didn't live up to the hype. Had it not been crazily over-hyped it might have earned one more star as the let down would have been more gentle."
"My friend and I came for dinner here for our first time and absolutely loved everything about this place. We've always heard great things, but wanted to check it out for ourselves. The food was amazing. We tried a small hummus plate (perfect for a mini appetizer). Afterwards, we bravely tried the goat empanadas, diver scallops and the chickpea fritters. So much flavor in all of them I couldn't chose which was best. However, our absolute favorite was the Pigs Head. I can't even explain how delicious it was. Aside from the food being wonderful, our server, Lindsey, was great! She provided us with awesome recommendations and we enjoyed her company as our server. We will be going back with friends to try other items on the menu."
"I went there with my wife on our anniversary and we enjoyed every moment we spent there. Right from the service to the food, everything was just perfect. We ordered sautÃ©ed green beans, diver scallops and goat belly on the suggestion of our server. They were all a treat to our taste buds. In the end, we went for miso butterscotch budino dessert. It was just the desert, we wanted to end our day with. In short, we had an ultimate dining experience."
"There are plenty of reviews about the food here but I felt compelled to write a review based on the excellent service we received here.Our party of 2 had a 4:45pm reservation, we arrived a bit late due to traffic and were worried that our table would be given away. Â However, we were instead greeted warmly and to our pleasant surprise, were seated at one of the 2 Chef's Tables that provided a view of the open kitchen where we tried not to stare and gawk at Stephanie Izard. Â It was amazing to watch as her presence commanded the kitchen to make sure every dish was perfect. Â At one point during our meal, she even came by to chat with us and was super friendly!Our hostess, Marnie, was hands-down awesome. My friend has a food allergy and Marnie literally took the menu, consulted with the kitchen, and went through with us line by line which menu items we should stay away from and which ones the chefs would be able to tweak to remove the allergen. Â  As one of the perks of sitting at the Chef's Table, we were given 3 samples to try throughout the dinner - oysters, bacon slices, and a salad, all of which were delicious! Â Other dishes we ordered were: Grilled Octopus w/ pistachios, Pig's Face, Pork Shank, Goat Belly, Goat Mousse, and chocolate-chili gelato for dessert. Â The pork shank was my favorite - the kimchee sauce on the side was simply delightful!"
"I had been dreaming about this place for quite some time, but I had no idea what I was truly getting myself into. Sister, friend, and I decided to make the trip here during Sunday of NATO weekend hoping that people would be hiding from protestors and cops in their condos. And boy, did that work to our advantage! We were lucky enough to grab seats in the lounge the second we walked in. (insert fist pumping action here)We decided to grab some beers and order 5 dishes. The roasted beet salad, escargot ravioli, divers scallops, and pig face are all menu regulars and were incredibly decadent. We also ordered the goat belly off the specials menu, mmmmeatariffic. As you can imagine, all these meat gets really rich and salty after a while. Thankfully, the waitstaff were attentive and made sure we never had empty glasses. Maybe it's the Chinese in me, but all the meats would've gone great with some white rice. If the universe aligns for you and you are lucky enough to grab a quick seat at GATG, make sure to buy a Lotto ticket too. If you win, please take me out here again so we can converse over meats & an Allagash White."
I've been here.
"This is easily one of my favorite places in the city. While it can take a while to get a reservation on the weekend and at a normal dinner time, it's totally worth it. I've also heard that if you don't mind eating early (5ish), it doesn't take that long to get a reservation. The food is simply spectacular. My favorites are definitely the pig face and the duck tongue salad. If you're not an adventurous eater, it may be a bit harder to find things you're willing to try since the food does tend to be ""different."" This is small plates, so it's great to go on a date or with a group of friends and share different things. If you're going on a date, I HIGHLY recommend asking for the chef's table. They have one at each end of the kitchen bar area, and it doesn't cost anything extra. It's a cool place to sit because your back is to the bustling restaurant, so it's a bit more intimate. You get to sit right where the food comes out and chat with the various chefs while they make the different dishes. It's a cool experience to see everything be put together. As an added perk, they usually give you a couple of complimentary tastes throughout, which is a nice touch. Finally, something that I think is really great about this place is that it is relatively affordable. My date and I spent $130 including tip on a nice bottle of red wine and five plates. We are both big eaters, and we didn't leave hungry. I'm not saying this is cheap, but I've been to several restaurants where you spend a lot more than that on a nice dinner and end up leaving hungry or less than satisfied."
"Yeah, this place was good. Sure, it took nearly 3 months from the date the reservation was made to sitting down. Â Was it worth the wait? Â It wasn't bad!This place makes me kinda laugh because people make such a big deal out of how ""exotic"" the food is. Â If you really break it down to what you're eating everyday, it would probably sound exotic too: ""Belly of fish,"" ""Ground who knows what of cow."" That said, we ordered the pig face which was the heaviest of the 4 dishes that we ordered. Â People, this is bacon and eggs. Between the two of us, 4 dishes left us at a nice level of full. Â We also had the beets, the goat empanadas (you only get two, the cream cheese and red sauce is tasty) and the escargot ravioli (good but I really had to not look at the escargot when I ate it. Â I've had escargot several times before but this just looked nasty when you broke into the pasta.)It all ended up being reasonably priced which was the best part of the meal. Â Walking out with $90 for two people isn't bad. Â I would definitely come back as the food and price are reasonable."
"This is a good but not great restaurant. Can't make a whiskey sour properly (""we don't have eggs at the bar""; then go get one from the kitchen). The food is good but try's to be adventurous but really isn't. This is too large a space to make great food. And because it has been yelped so many times the rating doesn't budge when it gets lower reviews. Also suffers from travelers bias (many people with bad food at home city come to Chicago , use yelp, eat here and then give 5 stars)."
"Worth the 3 month wait. Believe the hype!Pigs face, pork shank and the bread were home runs. Great service also. Get your reservations now. Do it!"
"Alright, I'm updating my review to give Girl & the Goat 4 stars.Although I'm still turned off by how loud the atmosphere is, I returned last night and thoroughly enjoyed the food and service. Â Our server was incredibly friendly and helpful. Â I loved her suggestion that the four of us in my party each circle two items on the menu and pass it around until we selected 8 dishes total. Â She was correct that all of the menu items truly go together well regardless of the combination ordered."
"So what do I write that nobody else has....Probably nothing, so here's my main takeaways:1) My wife (the foodie among the two of us) felt it lived up to the hype. My palette is less sophisticated, but I enjoyed it as well.2) The service was very good. Given their reputation and endless reservations, our server could have easily phoned-in his tip, but he was genuinely nice and very helpful in selecting our dishes and then coursing them out thoughtfully. Thank you Hunter - we will be back!!3) The food combinations were very unique but very tasty. This is not your typical duck fat and truffle scene. So it's a nice departure from that.4) If you think you have to wait months for a reservation, you're wrong. We were able to get an early reservation one day in advance. If you are OK with eating at 5PM, the world is your oyster. Plus you get home by 8PM to watch Archer on Netflix and drink a few more bourbons (after you Yelp of course), but I digress...5) My barrel-aged Manhattan was interesting - two bourbons in one drink?? - and it was actually very smooth and balanced. Nicely done!Just go. You know you want to. You may love it, you may hate it, but c'mon. Really, what else do you have to do?"
"Alright, Alright, Alright... I have to admit I came in to Girl & the Goat a wee bit on the skeptical side, because REALLY, come on now, how could all those marvelous things that I had heard about this place actually be true? Well... they were right, and by the end of the evening I was definitely impressed and here's why-1. The servers were all incredibly nice, incredibly attentive, and incredibly helpful in a straight-forward and blunt kind of way that I absolutely ADORE.2. Not every dish was my favorite but every single dish had a flavor profile that was undeniably on-point and really well balanced (In particular though the shishito peppers, Grilled Baby Octopus, and HOLY MOLY THAT MISO BUTTERSCOTCH-BUDINO.... uh ya, it's a MUST TRY, too beautiful for words to describe, and that's coming from a pastry school grad here)3. There were 6 of us in our party and we got about 10-12 dishes that we all ate ""family style"" and so split the cost of food and we each paid about $40 for food alone (tax and tip included) and to me this was quite the bargain considering the level of service and the quality of dishes that G & G provides, truly a great value, and due to that alone I completely understand now why it is so hard to get reservations (and why some people will kiss the feet of busboys in order to get a table here... ok maybe that's a bit of an exaggeration...) Suffice it to say I get it now why people LOOOOOVE this place, and while I wouldn't say it's my all time hands down fave in the city, I will say that eating at G & G does give you a great night of truly exceptional dishes and service for a much lower cost than other restaurants in this city would have you pay.oh ya I forgot my 4th reason of why I love this place... Â 4. Blood and Goats"
"Happy, but not amazed!This restaurant came up in Chicago as the most reviewed and stands tall as having one of the highest ratings, I expected perfection. Â That, I did not get.First of all, this place is over-priced for the food they serve. Â Yes, the food is good, but for the prices you are charging, some of the flavors should be more refined. Â The following were ordered:1. Hiramasa Crudo - HORRIBLE, I would NEVER order this again, the aioli did not mix well with the fish and made it heavier than it actually should taste, the cranberries did lend enough citrus to the dish and the pork bellies were on the dry side.2. Shishito Peppers - $7!!! Â I probably could have made this at home, it was drenched in oil and after eating 2 or 3, I'm about done3. Seared Scallops - I actually enjoyed this dish, the scallops were true diver scallops and were decent in size and flavor.4. Pig Face - something everyone raved about, and I must agree, it was a winner, the egg was cooked to perfection!5. Goat belly - MY FAV!! Â There were many elements to this dish and surprisingly melded very well together!Atmosphere is rustic, with bare tubes showing above, service is superb, with the exception of the buss boys, they were a little clumsy with the water, and spilled on me twice!"
"finally finally finally got to try this place. after many failed plans to get a reservation (you have to put one in at least over a month in advance), my friend and i finally decided to go early and eat at the bar. it was delicious.we started with drinks, which were hit and miss. hers was a whiskey cocktail, which was delicious, and mine was a gin something (i think it had something to do with lakes in the name?) that was not so good. both were recommended by our waitress, but more about her later.we started with the roasted beet salad, which was good, but not great. it just wasn't anything special, and the fishy caesar sauce didn't do much for it. i think the overall theme of the dinner was that food was prepared really well, but the sauces were kind of meh. i love beets and beet salads, but i would say to skip that one.then we had a goat liver mousse, which was fantastic. it came with these biscuits that were buttery and hot and soft and melty and pretty much perfect. they would have been totally amazing on their own, but with the liver, it was just a perfectly inappropriately decadent food that i would gorge on if i knew i had only a few days to live or something.the duck tongue and poke was so so great. i've definitely had better poke in my life but the duck tongue was crispy and delicious, fried so that eating duck tongue became incredibly appealing somehow. i liked the way it was mixed with the poke but i kind of liked them separately better.the pig face was as good as everyone always says it is. it was chewy and tender and not too salty. everything about it was perfect. the portion was pretty big too, which was surprising.we also tried the goat empanadas on a whim and they were okay. the filling was really good - moist and flavorful, a little pungent, not too salty. but the sauce it came with left a lot to be desired. it was basically just cream cheese with some red schmear on it. that really solidified my opinion on the sauces here.the meal was huge. it was more than the two of us could comfortably eat and we stuffed ourselves. our waitress was kind of annoying and took forever to bring us a drink we ordered at the end, though i guess it was kind of busy. though we did see her standing around doing not much for a bit while we waited. the music was good, the atmosphere was perfectly casual, and a good time was had. i don't think i'd go back unless they had something more interesting added to the menu, but i'm so glad i finally got to try this place."
"I will not go into detail on the dishes we ordered, and how they tasted. Â This place is a classic example of high-end restaurant serving small dishes that are not filling. Â Yes, the food here is tasty, and yes the ambiance is cool, but you will not be full when you leave. Â Really small portions.We ordered two drinks, 4 dishes, 1 dessert. Â $150. Â I was still hungry. Â If you're looking to spend that amount of money go to Gibson's, or Capital Grille. Â You will receive a better tasting, fulfilling meal for the same price.I was not impressed with this place at all. Â Too much hype for our reservation that was made 3 months in advance."
"This is one of my favorites and I feel bad about leaving it a 2 star rating. Let me say first off the food is delicious. I have been here several times and had a great time. My problem is with ""Jill"" the waitress and the wait staff. We didn't have a reservation and were prepard to wait as long as we had to. They seated us in 30 minutes where the waitress noted ""the time is ticking""when we asked to get more time to see the menu as they had a reservation after us and only gave us one hour. Â I don't go to a restaurant like this to be rushed out. The wait time was 1 hour and I was perfectly fine enjoying some cocktails before dinner and waiting for a table. My suggestion would be to clearly explain this to your guests so we could make other plans accordingly, opposed to making us feel unwanted while paying over $100 for a dinner for two."
"One of the best dining experiences of my life. This was my 2nd time visiting, and I'd gladly return. The food is simply outstanding.Let's hit one thing up front though: if you want more of a romantic & intimate dining spot, this isn't the place for you. Come here if you're a fan of food & socializing. It can get really loud in here. Girl & the Goat is more of a communal experience than an intimate dining experience.I won't get into detailed descriptions, but my favorite dishes have been: Chickpea Fritters, Kona Kampachi Crudo, Sugo, Sauteed Green Beans.My dessert I had this time was pretty amazing. It was a ruby red grapefruit kufli. All sorts of textures & flavors everywhere. I can't even really figure out how to describe it, but it should be tried by everyone!Price is very reasonable. We basically had 2 8-course meals for $135 before tax & tip. That included a couple glasses of wine as well. Can't wait to come back!"
Pig. Face.
"Yes, it's amaze-balls. And reasonably priced. AND the staff is well trained and attentive. Had the goat empanadas, the belly, cauliflower and the roasted pork shank which I highly recommend. Well seasoned meat falling off the bone and served with a harissa based sauce that had just the right balance of spicy and salty."
"Went there on our trip to Chicago and heard great things about this restaurant. Place is cute, very loud. Food was decent nothing memorable, we had octopus which I thought was kind of tough, braised beef tongue, which I could not find on the plate, three paper thin slice of tongue and that is it!!! Goat cheese empanadas were probably the best. I would say best part of the meal was the desert, Goat cheese bavarois, I loved it! Wine list was extremely weird, nothing below $50, I meant nothing decent, I saw a Pinot noir from Macedonia, I had to read twice cause I could not believe it."
"One word. Phenomenal. If you are thinking about eating here, stop thinking and do it!"
"When you take a foodie trip, there are certain expectations of the carefully researched destinations that made the short list. Â Girl & the Goat is a place that managed to exceed said expectations, even those as lofty as my own. Â This has been on my Chicago list for several trips, but due to lack of available reservations, I just never bothered to go. Â This time, though, timing worked out so that we showed up right at opening as walk-ins and got two prime bar seats - which we proceeded to monopolize for the next few hours as we over-ordered our way down the deceivingly simple looking menu. Â I call it deceivingly simple because ""beef tongue, salsa verde"" sounds like a pretty basic dish, but what comes out is anything but. Â More like, beef tongue with the most interesting salsa verde ever accented with cucumber and other unexpected but fitting flavors. Â After only a few dishes, it becomes apparent that the most remarkable part of this restaurant is the amazing flavor profiles - some expected, and some unexpected, but all spot-on. Â The perfect lemony acidity to highlight the grilled baby octopus with buttery potatoes and guanciale. Â (I didn't even see bacon on the menu!) Â A dessert of brownie, toffee, and uhm...what's this I spy? Â Shiitake mushrooms? Â Sounds pretty creepy, but is actually delicious. Â Beets with avocado? Â Try it. Â They also do wonderfully with textures: Â why add plain old capers when you can add crispy, fried ones to your goat carpaccio? Â Service was delightful, and my biggest regret was not having tried Girl & the Goat sooner. Â Don't be intimidated by the lack of available reservations: Â just walk in; Â this place is well worth the wait. Â Within just a few hours, the Goat became my *third* favorite Chicago restaurant. Â (Let's face it: Â competition's pretty stiff with Grant Achatz right down the street making lists and cooking up the most highly regarded food on the continent!)"
"After over 2,000 reviews, there's nothing I can add that hasn't been said. Â Except -- I've been here and I loved it as much as the majority! We were pleasantly surprised by the dozen or so dishes we ordered. Â Honestly, we lost count. Â It was a fun experience as well as being amazing food. Â Would love to try again but I don't know if I can make a reservation only to wait 2-3 months go to."
"excellent. great food. interesting and flavorful. i regret not having gone there earlier.great service. in fact our server told me a couple of times i was ordering too many dishes! but there were so many good options my guest and i had to try.after two mediocre dinners at vermillion and japonais, i needed a successful dinner.will be back soon."
"Food was certainly a letdown. Service was very good, efficient, drinks were ok. My fiance had been here 6 months ago and had good food, but we both got sub par dishes for most everything tonight. Hamachi dish fish quality was ok and dry, cuts were sloppy, mayonnaise sauce smothered it into a mucky dish, not fresh and bright at all, missing citrus.Beet salad was good, but aged lemon and creme fresh was barely there, so lots of good beets, supposedly anchovies but basically missing, so essentially a beet salad you would make at home.Big disappointment was the baby grilled octopus...I never knew little octopus could be so chewy, and it was a bowl of small cut veggies mixed with it, fried in a heavy dose of fish sauce, maybe some burnt soy, but quality and textures were so low it was tempting to send back.Fried squash blossoms were our favorite, fresh and crisp with a nice cream inside and nice flavors.Pig face was not good either, for a signature dish again gets 2 stars, really nothing besides egg and burnt pork flavor.What I mostly noticed in the food was lack of detail and a cafeteria like feel, although nice service and atmosphere. I believe this restaurant was good at one point, but they've outgrown their quality control, and I'm not sure they'll regain it with the expansion into other endeavors. They are apparently taking the show on the road, which hopefully has better food, as I don't understand what is unique or good about what they are making. Service and atmosphere was nice though, food a serious letdown..."
"I typically love Girl & The Goat, but on my third (and possibly last) visit everything was riddled with salt. Upon our group's arrival the hostess immediately informed my table of 10 that there was a reservation coming in right after us so that we should be wrapped up by 8:00... this was one of the most off putting things I've experienced at a restaurant... my table and I felt a touch rushed the rest of the evening. (Note the group was there on time for our reservation, we had two people arrive about 15 minutes late)We ordered all three of the daily breads, and were only impressed with 2 of them. The chicken stock bread was very bland and a serious waste of carbs. The first set of plates surrounded veggies and fish. Each over seasoned and terribly salty. The Chickpeas were the dish where flavor actually existed.The second set of plates again overly seasoned, the octopus was quite bitter, and again SALTY!Meat, how can you go wrong?... with too much salt! Greenbeans (I remember them being delightful, this time - I could barely choke down 2.)I will say the scallops and pig face were delicious, chicken was over seasoned, and pork shank under seasoned Â (shocking!)I don't know what has happened in the G&G kitchen, but last night was truly a thumbs down. I'm disappointed because my last two visits had been tremendous... but based on nearly every dish tasting like a salt-lick... I'd say Girl & The Goat may have jumped the shark..."
"I had been trying to get reservations for a couple of months and took a chance and showed up right before they opened and was able to get squeezed in at the communal table before another reservations. I never really like sitting at a communal table, it seems like you are always squeezed in, but that was not the case here. The table was huge and enough space between the other parties so you didn't feel like you were on top of them and with the open kitchen right behind the table, we could not hear the other guests at the table. Food and service were excellent. Our plates were exchanged out after each course and water glass never went empty. Impressive beer list too. We started with the roasted beet salad. The sardines mixed in added a nice saltiness to the dish. Then we had the Arctic Char. Up next was the fire roasted broccoli. The rice krispies on top added a unique texture that went well with the broccoli. To round out the main meal we had the pork shank. It was crispy and the kimchee butternut squash cut the fattiness and richness of the pork nicely. At that point I didn't think I could eat any more, but we decided to get some coffee and the bittersweet chocolate dessert. I was a bit worried about the shiitake caramel gelato would not taste well but the flavors melded well and complimented the chocolate cake. Its been a week since we went and we are still thinking about our meal and cannot wait to go back again."
"I made reservations to Girl & The Goat back in November for a Saturday night in February. And that's at 9:30 pm. Yes, it's that popular. I wanted to go early to enjoy a drink at the bar while we waited for our reservation and the bar was jammed packed. It took awhile to get the bartender's attention, but once I did, I ordered an Antigua, which was very strong and quite good. Once we finally got our table, we ordered the following: Bread (I forgot the name of it but it was quite fresh and it came with a blue cheese and tomato spread), Hiramasa Crudo, chickpea fritters, goat empanadas, sauteed skate, and of course, their famous pig face. Everything was good and flavorful but my faves were the goat empanadas and the pig face. I was very tempted to get another order of those empanadas. I loved them! The pig face was everything I imagined to be - crispy, tasty, and that egg on top really added to the dish. I thought the sauteed skate was just okay and mainly ordered it because it sounded interesting. Then it was time for dessert and we decided to get the chocolate cake with pomegranates, chilli powder, and milk stout. Wow, that chocolate cake was so rich and delicious.The only disappointment of the evening was Stephanie Izard wasn't cooking that night, but I did see her come in later with friends, so I got my Top Chef celebrity fix. She is probably the only chef I liked who won from all the seasons.Even after eating everything, I was still hungry and probably should of ordered 2 more plates to try. I definitely agree you should order 4-5 plates per person. Definitely going to come back. I still need to try their ribs and everything else again."
"While surfing through opentable.com looking for vday ideas, I came across GatG. Â so for shits and giggles I just decided to see what reservations they had if any. Â I was completely surprised that they did, but it was either for 430 or 930p any night that was available. Â I had heard great things about this place so I just bit the bullet and reserved the 930p slot for two months in advance. Â the wait was definitely well worth it.I was STARVING by the time we got to the restaurant cuz it was such a late reservation. Â The place was still PACKED at 930! Â looking around I saw that the tables were quite close together and it was REALLY loud there. Â I thought we were going to get stuck really close to another table, but the hostess kept walking us to the back. Â finally I saw our table, and it was one of the chef's tables! Â this got me really excited.This place is family style or like a tapas place where you order a bunch of small plate items and share with everyone. Â fine with me, that way we got to try a bunch of different things. Â From other reviews I see most of the menu has already been covered here, but let me recommend a couple of items we enjoyed. Â The crispy pork shank and the crispy duck tongue were our two favorite dishes of the night. Â all of the dishes were really good, but these two stood out to us.Coming into this meal, I knew it was going to force me to sell a kidney to afford it, but hey, it was well worth it. Â reservations for this place are very difficult to get and for good reason, the food is great here. Â We did try a couple of the mixed drinks but we weren't wowed by them at all and the waitress had trouble recommending a drink for me. Â but hey, we came for the food and coupled with our chef's table, that made our day! Â thanks GatG for the great experience!"
"This is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago.Eat until you feel like you're going to throw up.Do not leave without ordering the ham frites.If there are any left over, shove them in your purse and run."
"Can't.Wait.To.Return.My fiancee took me here for my birthday and it was more than a surprise. She told me we were going to somewhere else and when we walked by, she pulled me into one of the best dining experiences I've had. The food was phenomenal. I wont go into detail because I'll be repeating everything people have already said. Get a reservation to this place no matter what. Do yourself the favor because your tastebuds will never forgive you if you miss out on this restaurant."
"Thank you baby Jesus for my lucky reservation that I booked same day instead of 2 months in advance!!Girl and the Goat is absolutely AMAZING. The ambience and interior design were warm and inviting. The service was exceptional. And the food was gratifyingly delicious. I tried:* pan fried shishito peppers* squash blossom rangoon * corny goat bread* hiramasa crudo* goat cheese bavaroisAll of it was incredible, but the hiramasa crudo is one the BEST things I've EVER tasted in my life. Phenomenal beyond words! I encourage you to book your reservation right now. Seriously."
"Pan Fried Shishito Peppers ($7) & Roasted Caulifower ($11) dishes..... the two plates that keep running through my mind, tempting me to make another reservation right away! I went to dinner with my husband and sister last week, sharing 6 plates. It was easy and encouraged to share, and we all left full (& satisfied). We had to wait about 10 minutes despite our reservation at 11 PM (not bad), but enjoyed great service throughout our meal. The restaurant is well-designed and creates a pleasant, rustic-modern atmosphere. From our table, we had a view of the kitchen, which is brightly lit, contrasting with the dimmer main floor, where we were seated. It was nice to have that glimpse of where the magic happens....aka where the dreamy shishito and cauliflowers are prepared."
"The Girl and the Goat is a delightful and unique dining experience. Â It's not a place where you are going to get gorged on vast quantities of food, but rather enjoy a tapas kind of menu. Â The menu features vegetable, fish and meat ""entrees"" and, of course goat. Â Our waiter, as is the case with the entire staff, was delightful, efficient and informative. Â Our server recommended two entrees per person, which along with an order of their freshly baked bread (in their own bakery across the street) was more than adequate -- especially when you get a dessert. Â Our favorite part of the meal were the Goat empanadas . Â Full of flavor with a great presentation,. Â  The green beans are also outstanding. Â  That does not mean the rest of the food was just OK -- it too was excellent, but the empanadas were great.Our dessert (the apple bucket) was light and flavorable.The beer, wine and cocktail list is extensive.A Â few ""dings"" -- while the restaurant is large and comfortable (you're not sitting on top of people) it tends to be loud -- so consider that. Â It''s not a deterrent, unless your planning on a quiet intimate dinner.We ordered Goat loin, was nicely cooked, but could have been a bit warmer. Â The squash won tons were very good, but the order contains three -- which can make it ""tricky"" to share. Â Again, no big deal...just a bit unusual.With two drinks, two glasses of wine, two entrees each (remember, it's like tapas), dessert and one espresso, our tab was $127 plus tax and tip. Â Valet parking is readily available.The do an outstanding job of handling reservations -- which is a way of saying they honor them.If you like fish, much of it is shell fish or contains pork -- no big deal unless you don't eat it. Â The same holds true for their meat menu. Â We knew that ahead of time having checked the menu.All-in-all, is it worth it? Â Absolutely.It's a truly eclectic and enjoyable dining experience."
"Came here for dinner with 2 colleagues while on a business trip. Â We didn't have reservations, in spite of multiple warnings by our local colleagues we went anyway. Â Waited at the bar for a few minutes, then the hostess offered us immediate seating outside, communal style. Â The tables out front are bench-style picnic tables that seat 10 people. Â Our table was filled by our party of 3, another party of 3, and two parties of 2. Â You will literally sit with other people. Â We got lucky, as everyone at our table was very congenial and friendly. Â We ended up ordering so much food (more on why later) that we all ended up sharing across the table.So, when it's time to order, the waitress will give you her schpiel and she will say something like ""we recommend you order 3 or 4 dishes per person"". Â This is HOOEY! Â 3 or 4 dishes per person is way, way, way too much food and it can get quite expensive. Â Order 2 things each and see how that goes. Â You can always order more. Â That said, most things taste so good that you will keep eating regardless of the fact that you were full twenty minutes ago.On to the food: Â First off, this is NOT the place to come if you want ordinary, run of the mill food that you recognize. Â This is the place to come when you are feeling adventurous and in a try-something-radical mood. Â (I, for one, have to be in the mood to try something new, sometimes I just want a known quantity.) Â Anyway, there are some things this restaurant does well and some that it doesn't. Â I'll list what we had in 3 categories:Must have: Â goat empanadas, pork belly, pork shank, escargot ravioliGood: Â duck tongues, shishito peppers, pepper breadNot impressed: Â green beans, chick pea frittersFor dessert, tried the goat cheese bavarois, this is the best dessert ever. Â Whipped goat cheese with blueberries and a crust of some sort. Â The only reason I give this place four stars instead of 5 was:Communal seating outside. It was fun to try once, but I imagine the chances of getting such a lucky assortment of people is slim. Â I won't try that again. Â It could easily be a very annoying experience. Â Definitely not a romantic vibe; Â If you're on a date, don't site outside. Â Or do, but you've been warned."
"This restaurant is trendy, stylish, fun, and friendly. Â The food is absolutely amazing their flavor combinations are second to none. Â The textures, play on sauces, the gastriques used are amazing. Â I would highly recommend it just book your reservation early!"
"All of the praise & accolades this place has received more than well deserved!!!I came over for dinner a couple of weeks ago around 5:00PM on a Monday and luckily we were able to get a table for two instantly. I took a look around to check out the decor/scenery and was very pleased at the low lighted, intimate setting. I looked at the bar area and noticed there wasn't a chair available... thought to myself ""this place must really be whats up""Our very nice server came by and went over the menu with us in great detail. Thanks to her help and patience we grabbed a few dishes to share: roasted cauliflower (awesome), mussels (delicious), grilled pork ribs (off the charts), goat empanadas (great!) and braised pork shank (whoa!). As you can see I enjoyed every dish! For our drinking pleasure, we shared a bottle of chardonnay. For dessert, we were convinced to try the chocolate bouchon...really good!!!!I came back again this week with a party of 6 and we had a blast! The main course was the goat leg! I am still savoring the taste from it as it was just that damn good!I noticed we had the same server from my first visit...as the first time she was awesome! I had two great visits here and see myself having many more."
"Went back today... everything still delicious. However, the girlfriend and I went with 4 of her friends, and while we ordered 12 plates, we really didn't get much food. I literally had one bite of each dish, meaning I didn't really get to enjoy the dishes that I absolutely love. Next time I come, it's just me and another person."
"Service was good and the food tastes good too but not as impressive as it's small portion and high price. I have had pig face, duck tougue, beef stomach, intestines, etc.. ,(among other things American cuisine doesn't often experient on), cooked with recipes of thousand years old from ancient European and Asian cultures and they were much better. However, this is still a trendy fun place to try if you are not too serious about cuisine"
Wow shock and aw as I saw this creative menu I also saw a server who didn't know the menu ......something to think about....risk tisk
"Excellent food, excellent service, excellent prices.Stephani Izare is no joke. Saw her on TOP chef and wanted to try this place. Her food was beyond what i expected.Waited 2.5 hours to get a table (good luck without a resi), but the wait wasn't so bad because we started eating in the lounge. the wait was fully worth it. Besides having to make reservations months in advance,i do really like this place. It's low key, chilled out, young and bursting with flavour. The prices are low for what you're getting, but they can afford to do that with the sheer volume of customers this place serves. The food is exceptional. The menu is small and simple (broken into three categories), but there's something for everyone. Being a tapas style menu, it makes for a fun and intimate night with friends too, because you will want to share.I wouldn't say that there is a theme to the restaurant (besides ofcourse the fact that there is alot of goat on the menu). The flavours are from all over the world. But it makes for an interesting time because every dish is unique and always seems to have something upexected as a flavour. sometimes however, dishes can get lost in the one flavour you really don't enjoy, so if you're into simplicity, this place is probably not for you. Â I want to keep coming back here. It's the kind of place that would be a no brainer for dinner if you have friends from out of town, a birthday, or just a night to catch up. The quality/taste to price ratio makes it so valuable that you can't not go here."
"BFF and I went because we got SO many recommendations-neither of us tried goat before so did not order any, but got a free goat empanadas appetizer... and it was MY FAVORITE dish!! SOOOOOOOOOOO Delicious!!!"
yum .. yum. Â yum.
"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants! I was super impresed that with their crazy success and every moment of every evening booked, that the moment I walked in and gave them our name we were taken to our awaiting table! A-mazing!Everything we ordered was delicious. And all of the dishes were beautiful and inspiring. We had:Escargot ravioliChickpea frittersthe Crudothe Soguand Pig face If I lived in Chicago, I'd be taking my mom in a couple months. And I would get reservations for my husband's birthday. It was so good!The scene here was very vibrant, bustling, and loud but it works! We received each of our plates within a reasonable amount of time and all of it fresh and hot. The waitress was superb and was great at recommending dishes and drinks while also being friendly -- possibly even happy!I love it. Best of the best!"
"I am a huge Food Network Fan. Loved Top Chef and Stephanie Izard did not disappoint. It was CRAZY crowded and as a single I was able to slip onto the bar easily. But make reservation EARLY as this place is in high demand. I had the roasted broccoli, the Goat Head was really ,really amazing. I had so many wonderful entrees, as they are all small portions, that I was stuffed. The bartenders were very helpful with wine selection. This is a don't miss restaurant. Hey if the bar is full, she has another restaurant across the street that may have room."
"Came here with friends after hearing the hype. We shared twelve menu items, including goat, as well as a dessert.Rather than bore you with a long sermon, I will share a mini sermon that covers most salient points of the review.#1 - The atmosphere. Â The atmosphere is hip and loud. Â You will feel cooler eating here, even if you aren't all that cool. Â You will spend some amount of time comparing all the other cool people you see around you to yourself. Â Five stars.#2 - The service. Â The servers are on their toes and nice. Â The wine recommendation worked. However, the items came out so fast that we were very rushed eating. Â Four stars.#3 - The cocktails. Â Had a too-sweet Old Fashioned, but then had the ""Best of Three"", which I have to admit is one of the best cocktails I have ever had. Â The Violet Hour could learn from that one. Â Four stars.#4 - The food. Â The food was a disappointment. Â Of the twelve courses I ate, most were salty and overcooked. Â The goat was dry. Â The raw oysters tasted raw plus a couple of days. Â The fried oysters were not fried well. Â Nothing particularly stood out, even though many items sounded tempting from the menu descriptions. Â Two and a half stars.Go for a cocktail and maybe a couple of tapas plates to try it out, if you must. Â The atmosphere is better than the food."
"Amazing. If you are reading this, you don't even need to read the reviews. Honestly, just go do a walk in, wait the time (definitely worth it), enjoy some awesome beers (their red blend though is so good too), explore the inventive small plates menu and indulge. Seriously, I haven't had one thing there that I didn't like. Their menu is always rotating but if this is on the menu, I definitely would try! -Roasted CauliflowerPickled peppers, pine nuts, mint(amazing...tried her recipe at home too and it tasted awesome)-Beet Bread with goat cheese butter and walnut vinaigrette(all of their breads are awesome but this was my favorite..not sure when it will be back on the menu)-Wood Oven Roasted Pig FaceSunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, potato sticks(an obvious favorite and the presentation is great...so addicting)-Confit Goat BellyBourbon butter, lobster n' crab, fennel....OMG, that's all I have to say*About 4-5 options is a good amount for 2 people, prices are so reasonable too!!!Enjoy!!"
One of the best restaurants in Chicago.
"My bridesmaids brought me here for dinner during my bachelorette weekend and it was absolutely fantastic!!My maid of honor called about 8 months in advance to reserve a table. She knew I really wanted to go and was a huge fan of Stephanie's from Top Chef so she made sure we were seated at the long table right in front of the expo line. And her pre-planning totally paid off! I got to meet Stephanie - who checks all the plates as they're coming out (could she be any more amazing? - and the food, service, and ambiance were all great! Since we were clearly more concerned with chatting and playing a dirty drawing game with our napkins, we told the waitress to just bring us 12 dishes and gave her specifics of what we like and don't like. I have no clue what we ate but all of it was dynamite. And our waitress was great too!We already have reservations to return to celebrate my dad & husband's birthday together."
"Amazing!!!I made reservations three months early since I was planning my visit to Chicago and it was my boyfriends birthday. When I made my Open Table reservation, I noted this and we got the best table in the house - right next to the chefs cooking! We got to talk to the chefs and ask questions and they were all very friendly!And the food. Omg. The food. Everything we had was amazing. To start, we had the raw oysters. Delicious.Then, the shishito peppers. Cooked with sesame, miso, and Parmesan cheese. Never thought of this combo, but sooooo delicious.The chefs then sent us a sampler of the escargot ravioli. Boyfriend literally licked all the sauce out of the bowl. Diver scallops with kimchi. Order them. Now. Confit goat belly with crab and lobster. Need I say anything else?Pig face. No, it's not a pigs face on your plate. Served with an egg and some crispy potatoes. Soooooooo freaking good.And for dessert? Butterscotch, pineapple, and bacon equals heaven.Yes, it's expensive. With two drinks and a bottle of wine, we spent $200. I would spend it again. Worth every penny.If you are visiting Chicago, this place is a must!"
Adding another 5 stars because this place totally deserves it. The Fallcocia bread is amazing! Warm onion-y flavor with a sweet onion jam and mushroom butter. IT IS SO GOOD!!! I CRAVE! We started eating the jam with everything! The Goat Chorizo Flatbread.. Also an A! What a perfect blend of flavors and textures. PIGFACE! PLEASE ORDER THIS! I was already full by the time this came out but it was still absolutely delicious. The Ham Frites were unmemorable. Definitely something you can pass on... try something more unique! They're basically shoe-string fries sprinkled with ham? Kind of dry. even with the dipping sauces. I made reservations a month in advance...got a table for 2 at 10:45pm on a Sunday night. We ended up arriving an hour early and they were able to seat us. Lucky us??
"I've been excited to try out this restaurant since we began planning our Chicago trip. Â I've heard that this place has a 5 month waiting period, or else you'll end up with a reservation at 4:45 pm (early bird special) like we did.I love the concept of an ever-changing, innovative menu!We had 7 ppl in our party and ordered about 14 plates. Â We had all the breads - the butter (which looks like mayo in oil) is amazing!We also tried to goat tartar which was a highlight for many of the ppl in our party.My favorite dish was the braised beef with pasta. Â  Definitely a fun group experience!"
I had spent a year drooling over the night I would spend here so I feel a little bad for the place with all of my high expectations. Â  I had a soup at Bacon Fest from G&G that was possibly one of the best things I have ever tasted so that just further went to skyrocket my expectations. We had a variety of dishes from every category on the menu. Â  What we had:ScallopsFat breadRoasted broccoliseared green beansroasted pig faceescargot ravioliham fritesbeef tongue with salsa verdeEverything was delicious. Â  Nothing disappointed. Â  The only problem is that by the end of the meal you feel so overloaded by the extreme blend of flavors. Â  They recommend 2-3 dishes per person which is very true and adds up quickly but if you are splitting the 2-3 dishes per person among numerous people by the time the last few dishes come your tastebuds are just done. Â  This is a great treat and I wish I could split my visits up into smaller hauls when I do visit but of course this is no fault of G&G.
"This was my 3rd visit here but the first time coming without a reservation. Â The hostess said it would be about an hour and a half wait. Â It was a Tuesday night and my daughter and I immediately found a seat at the bar. Â Score! Â All of the bartenders are so friendly. Â None of the arrogance or disinterest that can be experienced at other restaurants I've been to on Randolph. Â We started with the Best of Three which is my favorite cocktail in Chicago. Â We then had the bread with the salmon cream, followed by the cauliflower which I could eat every night. Â It is so good! Â We then had the goat empanadas and the pork shank. Â Everything was delicious. Â The ambiance Â is very nice, well decorated, with no white tablecloths:). Â The noise level is energetic, but you don't have to yell to be heard. Â There really is nothing negative that I can say about this place. For a comfortable experience, fantastic food and super friendly service, Â it is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago!"
Most of the food was great. Â The wine that was available by the glass was fantastic. Â The bartender and our waitress were very friendly and helpful. Â I think this is a great place to go with a small group. Â We went with a group of four and were able to share the dishes easily and have a great relaxing experience. Â Get the broccoli!!
"I have been here twice. The first time was shortly after it opened and I tried for 4 months to get a reservation. My first impression was that it was good food but nothing stood out as outstanding. My second experience was with a large group. We must have tried nearly everything on the menu. Again, nothing stood out. I think this place is over-rated due to stephanie izard being on top chef and it is a tourist destination. I think all of paul kahan's restaurants are better. I think the restaurant ""TWO"" offers similar food that is much better and much easier to get a reservation."
"I think a lot of the hype with this restaurant is just because it's different and the new fad to try in Chicago, but overall the food was very good, and I love trying fresh menus. There are plenty of unique items on their menu, and I can honestly say everything I've tried so far at this restaurant has been good. I've been here a few times with different friends, and I don't know if it's necessary to come here more than once to experience it, but it is a good restaurant."
"There has already been enough said. I'll just throw my 5-star hat into the ring. Had the ""aMAIZing"" bread, scallops, baby octopus with guanciale, pork ribs, and pig face. All spectacular. If only I could enjoy the flavors without getting really full..."
"Finally got to come in here, and the food was amazing!We had an 8:15 reservation on a wednesday night and the place was packed. Unfortunately we had to wait around 20 minutes to be seated, so of course I was a bit annoyed and worried it would ruin the experience. We finally were seated and our waiter came over and he said we would get a surprise during our meal as an apology for the late seating. I thought this would be something like bread (which you pay for) or dessert. Much to our surprise in the middle of the dishes (they pace out dishes) they gave us scallop with goat and bok choy stir fry, plums, and currant, which was amazingg!! At this point I was very happy.Before this, we started with cocktails, I had the best of three which was awesome, and i had another as well. The drinks were also really strong.We ordered a variety of dishes. -The shrimp ceviche with plums and cherries was so great, and had some unique flavors. -The cauliflower was amazing (my boyfriend's favorite) with pickled peppers, mint, and pine nuts. -We had the smoky broccoli with blue cheese and spicy chips which was really unique. I love broccoli and the flavor was really smoky and good with the cheese.-Goat empanadas were awesome with really good creamy blue cheese again-pig face- got this because I read reviews to get it before and it did not dissapoint- amazing. Crispy and sweet and soo good.For dessert our waiter recommended the miso infused butterscotch budino with toffee bacon and cashews. This was the highlight besides the pig face. Amazing...The flavors were so good!Will have to find time to plan ahead a few months in advance to go back!"
"I never thought the day would come where I would rave over the flavor of eating a pig's face. Â The Girl & The Goat delivers on all the hype I had heard prior to my visit. Â While by all appearances it seems to be a bit of a scene and is difficult to get a reservation, I found the staff and clientele to be far more friendly than expected... I suppose being Chicago I shouldn't be too surprised."
"So totally great! The atmosphere felt like something special and the food was out of this world! One drawback, it is very loud inside and we basically had to talk so loudly to one another that it was practically shouting! But, I loved it. Also reserve way way way in advance! Only reason it is not getting 5 stars is the loudness and I must admit I liked the wine, but I have had better red for 12 a glass."
I would put 5 stars for the first time we went and 3 for the second time. Â It was not as good. Â The first time was the most satisfying restaurant experience I've had in years. Â Wood roasted goat neck. Â Sounds gross tastes amazing. Â One of the best things I've ever eaten. Â I loved it. Â Second time it was later on a Sunday night and it just felt like they were doing through the motions. Â  Wood roasted pig face was another girl and the goat home run. Â It is no longer a priority for me to go back there.
"My favorite flavors were the scallops with kimchi, escargot ravoli, and date cake with blueberry preserves and gelato. SOOOO yummy.I wasn't actually too impressed with the pig face, but maybe I read too many yelp reviews and was expecting too much. I'm also an old lady, so I had a hard time hearing across the table! And the server seemed to be timing our dinner, since we said we might order the chicken later, and she was like ""Oh that actually takes about 45 minutes"", so I'm not sure if she was trying to be nice and let us know it'd take a while, or trying to hint that she doesn't want us staying that long...."
"Forget the song Mary had a little lamb, it's all about the girl & the goat, aka Stephanie.If I can actually get to bring a restaurant back to SF, this restaurant would be it. Â The wait is worth it and the way to dine is to go in a small group and early so you can swipe a spot at the bar (where you can dine there and cut your waiting time in half). Love the open shelves in the kitchen that also serves as a wall between the kitchen and dining room. What to order:1. Diver Scallop- shredded duck meat topped with scallops to die for because the buttery sweetness absolutely melt in your mouth and tickle your taste buds which will make you close your eyes and moan mmmmm. My only complaint is there's only two scallops. I want more!2. String beans - Not the star of the show simply because it's just green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette.3. Shishito peppers- done the right way, which is pan fried and with lots and lots of garlic. 4. Escargot ravioli- Excellent sauce with the ravioli. I love the idea of having an escargot inside a ravioli. It's one of those ""why didn't I come up with this"" moments.I don't think you need my review to convince you to dine here. The ratings speaks for itself. My purpose: help you choose what to order but I failed because I didn't get to taste everything on the menu. I don't think I will or can be disappointed from anything on the menu. =) That's why G&G deserves a five star!"
"What can I say that hasn't already been said?I've wanted to come since opening day, but I'm not the greatest planner so making reservations way ahead of time never happened. Â Until a few days ago, which happened to be my birthday. Â We tried tons of dishes, probably more than most people do. Â We lovedlovedloved the beef tongue. Â I've had beef tongue prepared many different ways, but never quite like this. Â So flavorful, and the tongue was fork tender. Â By far our favorite dish. Â Probably the tastiest bite of food I've had all year. Second favorite for me was the pig face, for my husband the roasted cauliflower (he doesn't like runny egg). Â  goat empanadas were really tasty, culture club bread was super yummy. Â the only dish we didn't really go nuts for was the halibut. Â it was good, but compared to everything else it wasn't as strong of a dish.For dessert I was debating between two of them (napoleon and budino),and I finally chose one. Â but I was pleasantly surprised when they brought both for my birthday. Â the budino was my favorite, hands down.the best part was we drank, stuffed our faces, and our bill was like under $150 including tip. Â Unlike many other restaurants of this caliber, eating here regularly is not outside the realm of possibility."
"I have been to The Girl and the Goat twice now. I was absolutely blown away the first time; I remember having the Walter's chicken, which was fantastic. The most recent time was to celebrate my birthday. We had the chickpea fritters, the goat belly, the goat empanadas, the fried duck tongues, the onion bread with pea puree, along with one or two other things. The fried duck tongues were my favorite, although everything we ordered was fantastic. The service was excellent; the wait staff is very helpful and knowledgeable. I would give this restaurant a 4.5, my only reservations concerning the price point, and the slightly cramped seating areas. This restaurant is a must visit for any Chicagoan."
"Food was good, service was ok. Portions are to small to share with more then 1 or 2 people, but they made it seem like it was family style when we ordered. I ended up getting a burger an hour later. And was just as satisfied."
"It's been said before, but I gotta say it again. Get the pig face. Admittedly, it's a bit fatty but that's why it's great to share. Don't think I could handle all of it myself. And the best way to eat it is by making a kind of hash out of it.For desert, I went with the kulfi which wasn't the same as those I've had in India but it was equally amazing. The fresh flavor really comes through even with the slight heaviness in the kulfi.The port I finished with (it was $11, but I don't recall the name) had a fruity flavor somewhere in the vicinity of plum or black cherry. Not the best port I've had but not too bad."
Love it here! High quality food and great service. They were very attentive to our allergies and food restrictions.
"We had a great time at girl and the goat. Â I prepped for our visit by reading yelp reviews. Â I will say that the oven roasted pig face was amazing and fun to say at the same time, right in line with the reviews I read. Â The other item I kept reading about was the cauliflower; Â that entree I thought was tasty but not outstanding. Â Our server was great and recommended the best item of the night, the Sugo. Â I can't say enough good about the tender meat and sauce combined with the fresh flat pasta. Â So much flavor!Dessert was the parsnip cheesecake. Â I won't dwell on dessert since the highlight of the meal were the main courses. Â Five stars."
Service is excellent.but the food is ok don't get what the fuss is about. I don't care what my food bill is but this was crazy $227.00 for 4 people and we don't even drink. The beets were awful. Place is very busy. Just not for me.
"THere's been a lot of talk about this restaurant; maybe too much talk.In my view, it lived up to the hype. We did have to make reservations a couple months out, but once the day came, it was fantastic. The prices were surprisingly reasonable for a place this popular. The food was adventurous, but well thought out and executed. Als, it was very filling, given that it;'s a tasting-menu type situation.I especially loved the green beans, the oyster special, the escargot ravioli, the squash blossom rangoon, the lamb tartare, and the wood oven roasted pig face (by far the best pig face I've ever eaten). And the miso-butterscotch budino? Holy wow!Also they have good selection of single malts in the $12-$25 range, the service was great, and the atmosphere was trendy, yet comfortable. Dress code was casual. I will be back. The website claims that they do take walk-ins, so I might see how that works out next time."
I was a little nervous going to Girl & Goat as it was so popular it seemed over-hyped. I was wrong. The food is magical. And the staff are amazing and super nice. A wonderful night out and reasonably priced for the quality of food.
"Totally confused about the hype. Everything was super salty, and frankly not very good."
"AMAZEBALLS!!!We finally were able to get a reservation here, so we went a little overboard. That said, we live in LA, so went a bit crazy with the ordering. Small plates means something very different in the midwest. That said, we did our best to finish everything."
"Don't let descriptions like pig's face deter you from ordering.... You won't have a snout served up. This small plates menu is one of the best I have had... Simply because the food is more carefully crafted with more interesting flavor combinations. Service was great. Be advised, if you don't have a reservation they will tell you it's an hour to an hour and a half wait. Though you may find seating in the bar/lounge. We put ourselves on the list and had a table within 15 minutes... Apparently the hostesses cannot tell time - or they are encouraged to discourage waiting. Regardless, wait. It's worth it even if you have to wait an hour and a half... Or uh 15 minutes :)PS don't be discouraged if you're offered a place at the communal table. It's a great way to meet people and to try more food because everyone is inclined to share."
A star taken off for the strangest playlist. A little too all over the place for my taste. (Had to do it)Be sure to get the scallops/mussels/shanked pork/pork shank/shankin' pork. GET IT ALL. ALL. Perfection. The scallop was smooth like butter. The pork was smooth like butter. The mussels went down smooth like butter.
Awesome Food.Awesome Service.Awesome Restaurant.Just fucking Awesome.
"Truth. The real deal. As good as it gets. Somewhere around the time of werewolf molecular gastronomists and obnoxious saffron addicts, I grew tired of Top Chef and stopped watching. I kept up (through rumor and supposition) on the season that filmed in Chicago and thought it interesting (in a good way) that a local won. Oh, and what's that? She opened a restaurant. In The West Loop. And it's impossible to get in.Of course.Well, rave review after rave review finally piqued my interest to dismount from my high horse and... GatG shut me up. It shut me up good. I'm disappointed in myself for not watching Season 4 of Top Chef now. A local won. It was filmed in Chicago. The finale was in Puerto Rico. I have failed all around. Every (and I mean 'every') dish I've tried has been enjoyable. The menu isn't haughty or alienating. It just offers fresh ingredients served in familiar (to a point) ways made with the utmost skill. This is doing it, doing it, doing it well. If you have great service (which you should), go with the suggested recommendation and order 2 plates per person. At a four top, that gives you 8 dishes (duh) and that should be just enough to fill your belly, delight your senses and make you join the church. You should, however, save room for dessert (natch) and cocktails.Some of my standouts:ANYTHING VEGETABLES. Vegetables at a restaurant with 'goat' in the name? Yes. Yes! I hate green beans. Loathe them. I curled my body around the plate and made sure only I had access to these. Tremendous. Salty (fish sauce), savory genius. Kohlrabi salad with fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, blueberry, and ginger dressing? Made my guitar (and, by my 'guitar', I mean 'mouth') gently weep tears of joy. Chick.pea.fritters. Don't ask. Just act. Do. I had them with romesco, hazelnut hummus, sesame and goat feta. Breads. They sound basic. They taste fantastic. Don't count them as one of your dishes. Just order one or two for taste.Fish: Grilled baby octopus with guanciale, Â wax beans, radish, favas. pistachio-lemon vinaigrette. As guilty as I felt eating a baby anything (especially a baby sea monster), I can't deny that it was perfectly prepared and entirely addicting. Escargot ravioli. So much better than any escargot dish I've had in Chicago (and consumed before I would forever swear off escargot thanks to a traumatic experience in Uptown; more later).Meat: goat. Duh. Terrine, empanada, straight up, etc. You're here to eat. Do so with abandon. You may think you know the animal, but Chef Izard knows how to change things up with each preparation to make you have entirely different experiences with the same protein... in the same setting. There's a reason (well, many) that she won the show, folks.Desserts: they change. Get all four. No matter what they are, get.all.four. This is not up for discussion.Cocktails: not a bad one to be had. The beer/wine list is impressive as well. Not to say that the libations don't stand up on their own, but I found them to be pleasant accents to the food -- and that's as it should be. You're here to eat. There are plenty of other places in town where the focus is on liquids.This all goes to show that you shouldn't hate on the pretty, popular, volunteer-minded rich girl. Sometimes things really are *that* good and complete packages are *that* complete. If you live in Chicago, enjoy food and haven't been to GatG, you do yourself a terrible disservice."
"In fairness, I'd like to think I know good restaurants/good food. I wanted to like this place, and went twice just to confirm/disprove my first experience. Basically, G&G is way, WAY OVERRATED. It's not fine dining--maybe upscale gastropub, at best. Every plate is small, and both times we went, it was unanimous that the veg dishes were hands-down better than anything with meat, which were gamey, dry, and lacked much flavor.If you go hungry, you'll leave hungry, and given that most everything on the menu is $15-25, there are much better uses for your money."
"I'd been wanting to experience Girl & The Goat for some time, so when my ladyfriend got us a table for an early Christmas present I was pretty ecstatic. Our reservation was pretty late, especially for a Sunday night, so I was really happy their hours can accommodate just about any schedule. Our waiter was extremely helpful, he even flat out told me not to order a dish I was eyeing because it had been receiving poor reviews from other diners, appreciate the honest insight.Started with pretzel and butter, good beginning. Then we had chickpea fritters, chev made the dish, in my opinion, adding a sour flavor that was needed with fried chickpeas. Grilled baby octopus was cooked to perfection, but the dish was too acidic and smoky, cut down a little bit on the lemon and the guanciale and the octopus could be the star it deserves to be. Arctic char was good, but not truly memorable. The pig face was melt-in-your mouth good, the matchstick potatoes were really enjoyable and the two sauces they had were great in their contrast, I mixed everything together, as recommended, and everything melded beautifully. For dessert, we shared a shitake cake and gelato that tasted like the best tasting weed edibles there have ever been, and I mean that as a compliment. The waiter said the description is the one he'll use with some patrons...All in all, love the decor and the overall scene, food was great in some places, and the service was excellent. Highly recommend and will certainly return."
"Rich, creamy, delectable small plates! Great place to have drinks and enjoy the ambiance. A bit pricey for the portions that is served but over all delicous."
"I have been to girl and the goat a couple times now and feel ready to write a review. Â On my last visit, my wife and I made a reservation for a friday night towards the end of December. Â As expected, the restaurant was hopping and very lively. Â It is on the louder end of the spectrum when it comes to dining and definitely set up to have a casual and fun experience. Â The attire is typical of the other casual restaurants on Randolph. Â We sat at the bar for a bit; I enjoyed a tasty brown ale and my wife a rum and coke. Â The beer list is fun. Â I love going into a place where there are beers on the list that I have yet to try. Â After a couple drinks we were seated. Â We must have been having a bad hair day or something, because we were placed in the back... far away from the windows. Â It all worked out though, because it was a bit quieter there; perfect for a party of two.Our server may have been newly hired. Â He seemed a little unsure of himself and perhaps a bit intimidated. Â Nonetheless, he was very pleasant and courteous. For our starter plates, we ordered Â the cauliflower and fat bread. Â Both were well done and worth getting. Â We then moved to the octopus... it was decent, but have had better at a handful of places. Â Next, we moved to the duck leg. Â This was pretty tasty and presented well. Â Of course, we had to have goat, so we did some got empanadas, which were fun and tasty. Â  We ended the night with a custard, which was also great.I had 3 beers with our meal. Â Often, when there is an interesting, large or even eclectic bar menu, I simply ask the server to bring me something good and fun to pair with the food. Â Of course, our server, likely being new to girl/goat, seemed to be a little flustered. Â But he played along and did pretty well for himself, despite his initial apprehension."
"There has got to be something going on at a restaurant that garners over 1,900 Yelp reviews since its summer 2010 opening. Â Girl and the Goat, simply put, is a colossal addiction. Â  It's hip, cool, and loud. It's got the ultra fabulous Stephanie Izzard at the helm. Â It's oozing ambiance. Â I can't get enough of this place. Â It's just that kind of place you run back to again and again......and again.My husband hated Girl and the Goat during our first visit. Â I figured the problem was him, not the restaurant Â so I coerced him back. Â Last week was our fourth visit and he's surely not complaining about being back. Â Getting a prime-time reservation means you're waiting about 4 months. Â In a business dominated by men; it's awesome to see a female chef in command. Â There are 19 Michelin star restaurants in Chicago; only one, Naha is spearheaded by a female chef. Â By the way, Stephanie does not have a Michelin star.............yet ........but it sure as heck isn't hurting her career. We arrived early and enjoyed a drink at the bar. Â I was going to have the Manhattan but I opted instead for the ""kicking"" Tempest. Â This is a seriously ""in your face"" cocktail with rum and ""hits"" of spice and ginger. Â I read the house made Falernum has close to twenty herbs and spices. Â Is it just me or does the Shakespearean play ""The Tempest"" come to mind when you're sipping this drink?The menu is comprised of small plates meant to be shared. Â The menu seems to be enticingly designed to encourage over-ordering or at least that's how I feel. Â I always feel ""caught in the moment"" when I'm at Girl and the Goat and it makes me want to order ""everything""....... Â We opted for a couple of bottles of the fabulously smooth 2010 Lang & Reed Cabernet Franc during dinner that complemented the food exceedingly well. Â Dinner started with an order of the freshly baked wheat bread and onion brioche accompanied by yummy dips and two platters of warm marinated olives. Â  Our waitress was friendly, funny, and helpful. Â She told us the rule of thumb was 2 dishes/person. Â There were four in our party. Â She told us to take a menu and a pen and mark down 8 dishes we wanted. Â And away we went. Â  What I love about Girl and the Goat is the preponderance of well executed vegetarian dishes. Â Kudos to Stephanie Izard and Curtis Duffy who prove that vegetarian can be just as amazing and exciting as meat or seafood. Â Thanks to these imaginative chefs, my husband who firmly believes himself to be a ""meat and potatoes"" guy has been cajoled into enjoying vegetarian dishes.The food here is all about the blend of exotic and unique flavors. Â Nothing is spicy. Â The roasted cauliflower with parmesan cheese, pine nuts, mint and pickled peppers is a revelation for those who think Â the word cauliflower and ""blah"" are synonymous with each other. Â If you don't believe me; check out Stephanie's video on the dish preparation that ends with a quote from Mark Twain that says ""Cauliflower is nothing but cabbage with a college education"". Â The chickpea fritters are melt-in-your mouth divine with a great accent of stewed greens and dribbling goat cheese. Â The dish is small and a single order wasn't quite enough to go around for a table of four. Â We didn't order the green beans this go around as it would have been ""vegetarian overload"" for some. Â Nonetheless, this is a great dish; I still remember scraping out the last bits of the dish using my bare hands. Â The best part of the scallops was the sides of shiitake, bok choy, and butternut squash. Â The pan roasted artic char was again not so much about the fish but more about the blend of flavors and textures created by the sunchoke, olives, lentils & grapefruit. Â The oven roasted pig face and the short rib are not to be missed. Â Do not split an order of either between any more than two individuals as you will be craving for more. Â My favorite way to eat these dishes is to mix everything on the plate and dive in! Â The short ribs are melt in your mouth juicy and flavorful with the fried rice, pickled mushroom, and onion salad providing just the perfect subtle kick. Â Pig Face is an uninhibited medley of pig face patties with gooey eggs, crunchy potato sticks, and drizzles of tamarind vinaigrette, cilantro oil and maple gastrique. Â Oh Yeah! Â Dessert was bittersweet chocolate washed down with a double espresso but it wasn't nearly as memorable as the rest of dinner. Â See you back in four months."
"Great atmosphere but in all honesty this place is overrated. Â I still gave 4 stars because the food was good, staff very friendly and I really like the restaurant atmosphere but for prices and reservation wait-list you'd expect the food to be a lot better."
"Our favorite restaurant in Chicago. Wow, from the fried pickles to the fish sauce green beans to the wood fired broccoli with blue cheese. Oh, the yummy variety of butters and fresh bread. On to the skate wing croquettes and the pappardelle with cape gooseberries. Â  We sat belly up and enjoyed every bit of the restaurant. The bartenders were terrific. Highly recommend this gem of a restaurant. Well done!"
"Worth the hype.Worth adding another review to the 1000+ already on Yelp.Worth daily visits.Worth breaking your wallet.Worth getting fat over.RSVP'ed 2 months in advance, and was seated at 4:40. Had an awesome, laidback waitress who said ""I'm excited too,"" when I verbalized how much anticipation I had to dine here. We let her order for us and craft our dining experience (totaled to about $100 something including a drink and beer). She brought out some minis and full entrees, and we were left with glee after each bite. The timing and clearing of table was IMPECCABLE. Pretty much after each dish was cleared the next one followed in 20 seconds. ABSOLUTELY MUST GET: Starter bread!!!, pig face, desserts, lemonade if you love tartness (this made my face squirm but I loved it and it made sense with all the meat that I indulged)GREAT: salads, pasta (these were sheets of BLISS), pork bellyGOOD: fried oystersOK: green beans. Familiar stirfry taste, just like a Chinese mom's, but with a creamy drizzle on top.Our waitress was so awesome, and made the experience mutually fun. Will be back to Chicago just to eat here and order everything else on the menu."
". The place was recommended to me as an exciting place to try adventurous food, but ""adventurer beware."" The restaurant bills itself as pairing interesting flavors and textures together. My wife and I came with an open mind looking to expand our pallet and were Â extremely disappointed. We had the pig face, duck tongue and cuttlefish, along with some green beans. Friends described the pig face as succulent and rich, ours was hard as Canadian bacon with a nearly hard-boiled egg on top. I've never had duck tongue before. It was advertised as comparable to a crouton, but it was anything but crunchy. In fact, it was soggy and slimy. I've only had cuttlefish once before, but this one was cold, chewy (in a bad way, like poorly-done calamari), and ill-paired with lamb meatballs. I don't mind paying money to be guided through unfamiliar and unexpected gastronomic landscapes. But it should be done with skill, and this certainly wasn't."
"The food was great! The drinks were great! But the service! Ugh! Do not recall his name. Young guy dark hair. Worked the center area we sat in a table for 2, end of the night. Guess he was over working! We would need to flag down the guy whenever we wanted to order anything! Plus, It was my birthday and my friend mentioned we wanted a dessert. I even heard her say it's her birthday, she hoped for a candle. When it came, nothing just placed on table and he just ran off again! Luckily one of the bus boys asked if all was ok. He actually grabbed us a candle! Sweet! Other than that the food was great! Goat empanadas. Yum! The apple cheese bread! Steal tartare! And I must give kudos to the bar manager Justin! Round of shots for my birthday and he covered our dessert! The look on the servers face when he saw we had drinks on our table was priceless since his lazy butt didn't bring them! Haha. People wonder why they get .42 tips!!! But we didn't doThat! :)"
"Made my reservations 3 months ahead for 8pm on a Monday night, that should tell you how popular this place is. Dishes were tapas style, so we ordered a bit of everything. Standouts for me were the cauliflower, oysters and bay scallops. Their famous ""pig face"" just didn't do it for me, and the cod cheeks seemed like a dish you could get in Chinatown for 1/2 the price. Bread was a highlight, I didn't mind paying for something that's expected to be on the house. Desserts were well-balanced, not overly sweet, with interesting juxtaposition of flavors. I was especially fond of the blood orange sorbet. While I enjoyed many of the dishes, I thought the cp value wasn't very good, dishes were very small for their price and our group of girls left not quite full satiated. Nonetheless, I like Chef Izard's food enough to want to come back and try more things."
"WOWWOWWOWThey wanted three month for a reservation, so I took my chances and sat at the bar.I'm sure glad I did.Ordered goat empananda, they were fantastic.The waitress recommend the green beans and she sure was right. the sauce was so good I almost wanted to drink the leftover juice.She also recommended the Crispy Pig Face, served with an egg on top. It might not sound good, but it tasted fantastic.The place was hoping and I could see why.It is very original and worthy of there awards.I can't wait it go back."
"I've heard good things about this place before and have been wanting to try it, but reservations at reasonable times were hard to come by unless you planned weeks if not months ahead. Well, my friend had a great idea on super bowl night and he was right, there was no wait at all! Then came the food, man was I impressed. The portions were a bit on the smaller side, but the prices also reflected that. I normally don't write reviews but I had to do the food justice, so here are my five stars. Take them, you've earned it!"
"We made reservations months in advance and with the time change between PST and CST, we arrived at the restaurant an hour early. It was a Wednesday night and the restaurant was packed. We waited about half an hour and then they were able to seat us. The restaurant is filled with wood furniture and there are white lights and chandeliers that give the place a warm feel. It has a nice ambiance to it but the tables are placed fairly close together and it is pretty loud in the restaurant. One big negative was that we were seated at a table along a pathway for the servers so I kept getting bumped by people walking by. We had the chickpea fritters, goat belly, steamed mussels, and pig face. The chickpea fritters were good. The cheese was soft and runny while the fritters were crispy and there was a tasty sauce to bring everything together. The goat belly was also very good and similar to pork belly. There was a slight crisp to it and it came with pieces of lobster and crab and some vegetables that blended together wonderfully. They brought out the mussels while we were still working on the goat belly and then the pig face came out so we did not really have time to savor the mussels while they were hot. The mussels were cooked in a light broth and came with some croutons. The mussels by themselves were ok but I had one bite with the croutons that was very good before moving on to the next dish. With all of the reviews on the pig face, we were very interested in seeing what this unusual dish would be like. It comes with an egg sunny side up and some fried onions (or was it potatoes?). The dish was amazing. Overall, we enjoyed the entrees in the following order: pig face, goat belly, chickpea fritters, and then the mussels.We came here because of the high ratings and were a bit skeptical about the hype but Top Chef/Yelp got it right this time. Overall, the food is very good, the portions are pretty generous, and the prices fairly reasonable. We definitely recommend stopping by here in Chicago."
"I don't understand the hype. First of all the music is very loud so it's hard to understand each other. The service was not good. Our waitress decided to pour wine in our glasses ( we were the first to arrive) and completely ignore our guests once they joined us. No glasses for them, and no wine! The waitress also made us order way too much food. We sent half of it back. The food itself: very meaty, quite bland and nothing spectacular. This place does not deserve a visit. With so many wonderful restaurants in chicago I am surprised people still go there. Is it because the chef is famous?"
"I had always heard great things about this place... and I knew it was difficult to get a reservation here too. So, when my friend had a reservation she could no longer use, I took it off her hands. I had a date night here with my boyfriend last Friday, and it was wonderful. I was a little intimidated at first because I'm kind of picky with food and everything looked eccentric. It was all amazing! It is all small plates, so between the two of us, we picked 4. That was more than enough. We had the pork shank dish which was delicious! It was served with fruit and Naan bread, all the flavors complimented each other very well. We had a broccoli and blue cheese dish, the Ham Frites (soooo good) and the Goat Empanadas. I was honestly hesitant to try Goat, but I needed to step out of the box a little. I'm glad I did because they were AWESOME. They make a pretty strong cocktail too. My friend forgot to tell us that she made her reservation for an anniversary, so we were surprised with a free Zucchini cake dessert, which was DELICIOUS, to say the least. Our server was really helpful and knowledgeable and the place is beautiful. I figured it would be really pricey and packed but it wasn't. The atmosphere is pretty casual too. Definitely going back here, we've been raving about it for the last week."
This is consistently good. I am always amazed at how well the flavors blend together. The goat bleu bread was a good start. The goat empanadas were outstanding. This is a great place to experiment because everything is so nicely done. The chocolate cake and shatiki gelato had flavors I've never tasted.
"I did my due diligence on Yelp before my trip to Chicago, and realized it was too late to make a reservation a month in advance (this was about 3 weeks before my trip).Fingers crossed, I arrived at the restaurant without a reservation, hoping that the wait would be not too insane. To my surprise and luck, the host promptly seated my bf and I at a medium sized communal table near the kitchen. We had gone to the Purple Pig the night before, so we were on a small-plates theme for the trip. We ordered the Bloody Mary bread, pork shank, smoky grilled broccoli, goat empanadas, and arctic char my bf enjoyed (I don't eat fish).Bloody Mary bread - well seasoned but not too overly powerful with any flavors. I liked the sweet and savory Worchester butter that came with it. I'm not really a fan of Bloody Marys as a drink, but I enjoyed the bread.Goat empanadas - nice and crisp without the meat being too gamey.Arctic char with grapefruit, lentils - I did not partake in eating the char, but I liked munching on the spinach-like vegetable, balanced with the sour grapefruit and crunchy lentils.Wood grilled broccoli - this was a very memorable dish, but a little too smoky for my taste (I could feel the smoky flavor nearly coming out my nose). The little crispies were good, but as we kept eating it, they were swimming and soaked more and more in the bleu cheese. Meh.Pork shank - my favorite of the night! the waiter brought out this leg of meat on a wooden cutting board with some pita bread and sauces on the side. We were kind of full at this point and after eating the shank, we were completely stuffed. I think they slow cook it to get the meat to fall off the bone, and then deep fry it to get the skin all crispy. It was the perfect balance of textures and flavor, not too smoky or over-salted."
"I heard about this restaurant from a friend, who told me that I needed to make reservations weeks or months in advance. Â We went on a weekday night and so I was able to make reservations several days out. Â We were not disappointed! Â Everything was amazing, particularly the vegetables. Â My favorites were the cauliflower, the green beans, and the scallops. Â Service was excellent. Â This is such an amazing experience - should definitely be on your list of things to visit when in Chicago."
"Ok, so I'm naturally a contrarian, so if there's a restaurant that gets a lot of hype, I'm either going to stay away from it, or go there and look for reasons to hate it. Â I approached Girl & the Goat with a healthy dose of skepticism, and I left without a single disappointment. Â It's a tapas-style restaurant, so you taste a little bit of everything. Â Every single dish was done perfectly. Â It's not just what you order...it's all the unexpected flavors and garnishments that come with it. Â The goat belly was insanely good, with hints of butterscotch, a lobster/crab garnish, and additional sauce to die for. Â The scallops and salmon were equally complex...the scallops garnished with currants and nuts. Â But the dessert was possibly the best dessert I've ever had ever anywhere. Â I don't even remember what it was called but it was cake with a custard-like topping mixed with candied cashews, fruit pieces, whipped cream, etc, and I just couldn't believe that someone would go through such effort to design such a perfect and complex dish where all the flavors complemented each other and ultimately led you into a state of shame where you knew no one but the gods deserved something like this and that you were not a god but you would accept this accidental treat anyway because fuck it why not capitalize on this fortunate error even though later it might be found out that such a lowly person was allowed a taste of the divine undeservedly and thus must be punished and shown their place but who cares because all that matters is the present moment where your tongue was ringing a harmonious joy and pulsating waves of pleasure and oh my god is this good food..."
Amazing. Â Everything is so good. Â I've tried foods that I never imagined I would eat and they have all been outstanding.
"This was one of the best meals I've ever had. Â We happened to Â get a late evening reservation on a Saturday with only 4 weeks notice (in other words, we lucked out). Â Trust me, make your reservations in advance.I think the single most important bit of advice our server gave us was to ""treat the menu as you would ordering tapas"". Â The servings are a little larger than tapas, but are not intended to be a full meal for one. Â She recommended ordering at least two plates per person and sharing for a fuller experience. Â She could not have been more helpful. The kitchen also had timing down to a science. Â Just as we were completing one dish our next dish would arrive. Between the three of us, we ordered 6 plates including cultured bread with onion relish and leek butter, fried pickles, pan fried shisito peppers, confit goat belly with lobster and bourbon butter, duck tongues with tuna and black bean poke, and the crisp braised pork shank. Â We also ordered dessert. Â Suffice it to say we left full and thoroughly pleased with the entire experience. Â I'm looking forward to our next reservation!"
"Everything we tried here was a gentle play on our palates. Izard is great at creating order out of seemingly incoherent ingredients, and polishing them up with a Julia Child-like savoriness. The sauteed green beans, chickpea fritters and pig face are musts. The chef is also a big fan of beer and booze and I would not be surprised if most of these dishes were created while under the influence... so with that in mind, I ordered a victory golden monkey.Sadly, it's been a while since I've been back to dine at this fine institution (mainly because of the scarce reservations). But, rest assured Stephanie Izard, we are still dreaming about your chickpea fritters and wood-oven roasted pig face."
"Girl & the Goat doesn't need another 5 star review but it really was so excellent that I was shocked my inner skeptic couldn't find anything wrong with this mega hyped place.I've been twice so far and each time I've gone I have not had one single item I wouldn't order again. In fact, my second visit was tough because I wanted to order the same things I got last time! My favorite dishes, the ones I ordered both times and will probably have to be forced not to order a third time, were:-Green Beans-Wood roasted broccoli-Pig faceActually, all the vegetable dishes are the hidden gems. Description-wise they're not as sexy as all the meat but every vegetable dish has been stellar, so complex, and filling. The portions are good sized as well. Meant to be shared but large enough where you don't feel cheated after only getting a few bites of a small dish. Come as a group of 4 so you can try everything!"
"One of my best restaurant experiences in the city! Â Great vegetarian friendly menu, ambiance, and selection. Â Make sure to call way in advance if you want a table!Try the peppers and the mushroom souflet'"
"I really wanted to give this place a 4 star given it's popularity (reservations booked for 2 months), all the positive reviews and their menu which offered some of my favorite things (mussels, squash wonton, roasted cauliflower, scallop, Brussels sprouts). Everything was delicious but unfortunately every dish was overly salty and overpowered the natural tastes of the ingredients. Not sure if that's how the dishes are typically prepared or the chefs just went a little hard the salt shaker that night. Our waitress brought us dessert on the house as an apology after hearing our feedback. Always a plus when you know the restaurant acknowledges your feedback and shows that they value your opinion. I would come back to try other things on the menu next time I'm in town and hopefully make it a 4 star in my book."
"After hearing so much about this place, we had to check it out. It was really good. The hubs and I shared everything. A bit more meat focused than my tastes but I expected that with the name... The best part of the meal was the dessert- and I'm a dessert snob! We had a butterscotch candied dessert that seriously still makes my mouth water thinking about it now... Definitely one I recommend!"
"Exceeded my expectations, never thought that would happen. Â Came with a girlfriend. Â Made our reservations a few months in advance. Â Food was amazing! Â And the drinks were great too! Â Definitely plan to come back!!"
"Odd name, good restaurant. I was in town on a business trip last summer. It was a little pricey but the food is exotic and tasty. It was standing room only when we arrived for dinner. There is a bar and indoor dinning area and a lounge. There is also an outdoor dinning on a small patio. We sat in the lounge because there were no tables available for hours. I highly suggest calling ahead to make a reservation. This is a good restaurant if your palette is picky and your in the mood for something different. I had Goat check Â and it was okay. Overall, I liked the ambiance and drinks and food, in that order."
"If only it didn't take me THREE MONTHS to finally get a reservation here! Can you believe that after waiting three months, my reservation was on Sunday at 9pm?! Â After eating at G&G, I can finally understand why it took so long to get a table. This place is HEAVENLY. Â Like a teenage crush, I smile every time I think about my experience eating here. Â (Yes, I am currently smiling now)My bf and I ordered:-wood grilled broccoli- rated :] :]-wood fired walter's chicken- rated :] :]-wood oven roasted pig face- rated :] :] :] :] :] :] :] :]I could go into a long description about how delicious each dish was, but you really just have to experience the greatness that is Girl & the Goat yourself. And when you finally do go, please take me! And yes, this place may be listed as $$$, but it is absolutely worth the price."
"Definite must try if you're visiting Chicago! I was lucky to get a reservation, although it was at 11PM, which worked out fine.Must try the Pig Face and the Crisped Braised Pork Shank! The Pig Face has to be now my fav part of the pig after trying this dish. Sounds quite intimidating but it's really not. The pork shank was cooked perfectly (as well as all of the other dishes!). The combination of the pita bread/naan and the sauces was so delicious.The other dishes that we got was the roasted cauliflower and the diver scallops, which was okay. The escargot ravioli was good. For dessert, the bittersweet chocolate gelato was good too.The service was excellent! Our server was Gary who was very attentive and friendly.I definitely look forward to coming back to Chicago to many great eats like this restaurant!"
"Getting a dinner reservation here was probably the most exciting part of my Chicago trip planning! I had gotten recommendations from friends to get a reservation here but I was told it was going to be near impossible... But luckily we had booked our trip early enough that we were able to get a reservation for 9pm on a Wednesday night without any difficulties.On the day of our reservation, we arrived about 20 minutes early and ended up getting seated soon after we arrived. I was surprised at the size of the restaurant, I guess I am too used to SF sized places that don't have too much space, but there was a large seating area here. Pretty crazy how hard it is to get in here even though it's so huge! Even close to 9pm it was still pretty packed!The food was generally tasty, but a bit oily. The plates are small so it's probably better to come with a smaller group if you want to try everything! All the servers and wait staff were super super friendly and helpful, and they were really good about bringing our food out when we were close to done with one of the plates. We were working on 2 dishes at pretty much every point during the night.- Stucco with meyer lemon butter and mint: We don't typically order bread dishes at restaurants but I'm glad we tried this one. I liked the bread, and I really liked the lemon butter. It was kind of strange because I liked the bread and butter separately better than I liked them together though.- Beef tongue: This was interesting, I think I liked the slaw better than beef tongue (which I wasn't sure whether I was a fan of or not, but I guess not really). The tortillas added nice texture and crunch, but were quite oily.- Goat belly: Tasty! I don't even like goat too much normally. The crab on the plate didn't come through as much and there wasn't as much acid in the dish as in the beef tongue plate. Came with bourbon butter too but I didn't end up being a fan of that part of the dish.- Roasted cauliflower: So good so good! There was so much of it in the bowl, even though it looked like a small portion. The top of the bowl was almost mac and cheese-like. Definitely my favorite of the night.- Pig face - I think this wasn't as novel for me cuz it tasted kind of like Chinese pork shoulder, but it was still really good with the sauces and the fried things on the dish :)"
"Drop what you're doing, and RUN to G&TG - it may take two months to get a table, but once you get your little tush in one of those seats, and start to dive into the perfectly paced culinary experience ... you'll never want to leave. Â I asked if I could move in. Â A giggle and ""Maybe"" can be translated to ""Hells yes!!!"" - right? They suggest that you get many plates and share at the table, and we easily agreed that was the best way to go. Â Our family style tour started with the Squish Squash bread, a delicious loaf of sweet potato bread pulled fresh from the oven - with a butter that was so sweet it took all my restraint to not eat it straight from the bowl. Next the roasted beets w/ green beans, white anchovy, and avocado creme fraiche. Â It's hard to make this girl love beets, but we all couldn't get enough! Three of the girls at the table had never tried beets, and I think they will be severely disappointed with all future beet dishes. Â The bar has been set too high. Then to the roasted cauliflower w/ pickled peppers, pine nuts and mint. Â This was my favorite dish of the night. Â They should add, ""Oh, and Butter"" to the list, but this cauliflower is heavenly and a must try when at the restaurant. The wood grilled broccoli, rogue smokey bleu, crispy onions and spiced krispies was a surprisingly interesting treat. Â Spiced krispies - who even thinks of that? Â So unique and a lovely crunch to the plate. Â For the entree's we split the beef ribs, pig face, and scallops. Â All amazing, but the beef ribs with the grilled sweet potato would have to be my favorite. Â That sweet potato was just amazing - I didn't want to share! We were hoping the pigs face would be a ... pigs face - as we'd seen in other restaurants, but some of the ladies at the table were pleasantly surprised when it came pre-pulled. Â Regardless of on pig, or off - it was so tender and delish we cleaned the plate! The most amazing part? Â All this food left us wanting nothing (couldn't even squeeze in dessert) - and with a few rounds of drinks, it was only $50.00/person. Â I must say, not a bad deal for a restaurant which took 2 months to get into! Â I'm glad they keep the prices reasonable. Â Call now - and enjoy their food come ... summertime? Or just try to do the walk-in. Â I've had friends succeed that way."
"Love this restaurant! Service is top notch, cocktails are even better! Pig face, roasted cauliflower, and mussels are my favorite. Will continue going for years to come. Location is great as well and easy to get to."
"Had dinner on Tuesday night for my 28th birthday. Â There were 4 of us, so we went with 9 plates. Â The experience as a whole was great. Â The only negative was the noise. Â Not a big deal at all when the food was that good. Â Our server Allison was great. Â The ""must try"" dishes are definitely the Wagyu Tartar. Â Beautifully seasoned. Â The Goat liver mousse (A daily special) was delicious, especially with the applesauce that comes with it. Â My overall favorite by everybody was the Escargot Ravioli. Â It might be the favorite dish that I have ever had.The only dish that I didn't like was the Tempura seafood dish. Â I think it might have been trout. Â It would have been a lot better if it was a boneless filet as opposed to the whole fish. Â It was almost impossible to avoid the bones. Â I also was really impressed that Stephanie was there the entire time working. Â It isn't something that most chefs at her level would still be doing. Â I got my picture with her. Â She was super sweet and I wish her the best success."
"This was one of my favorite if not favorite restaurant in Chicago. Â booked way in advance and came with a few of my friends. We ordered:1. Wood oven roasted pig face2. Ham Frites3. Rappahannock oysters4. Sauteed Green Beans5. Ganache Pork fat doughnuts6. confit goat belly7. Roasted asparagus8. Grilled pork ribs9. Crisp calamari and rabbit ravioli10. Seared sea scallopsand some other dessertsEverything was delicious, I really liked the pig face and ribs and scallops. Â Overall a great experience, our waiter was great, service was great and most importantly the FOOD was to die for! Â My go to place whenever I am visiting chicago!"
"This place was amazing!!!! I'm from Dallas/Louisiana so I know great food like the back of my hand. After seeing some of the pictures on yelp and over 2700 reviews I knew I had to go. My favorite dishes/ recommendations are the Pig Face and the Country Fried Loup De Mer. Talk about delicious (with a southern twist). I went with my boyfriend and we had 6 dishes (the waitress was sweet enough to give us a half portion of 2 dishes so we really had 5). I would not recommend getting more than 5 dishes for 2 people. We did not finish all of the pork shank, but no worries, we took it home. We also did not get a vegetable which is why we probably did not finish the pork shank. I will post a picture of everything we ordered!!!The next time I am in Chicago I will definitely have to eat there again. If you are in Chicago and you don't eat here, then you have not really experienced Chicago. 5 stars!!!"
"I'm going to make this quick and simple. Â Some of these dishes were immensely delicious and complex and basically blew my mind. Â But some of these dishes were just way too salty--this coming with someone that has a greater than average love of salt. Â One that really stuck out as too salty was the Halibut, which I would advise skipping. Â The staff was great, everyone was cheerful and appeared happy to be there."
Well here goes...Arrived 6:30ish without a reservation. Our server Mandy was DELIGHTFUL! I would come back just for her. Got 4 different appetizers and they were ALL cold. I understand timing but come on. They have been open for 3+ years. I could have gone to McDonald's and gotten a hot meal. Never again. What is the hype? I am so disappointed.And I will eat anything.
5 stars! Enough said. You will NOT be disappointed. :)
"Came in with high expectations and an empty stomach. Dining experience began with initial disappointment, followed by a triumphant comeback, then a sweet finish. Overall impression: hit or miss mediocrity Let's break it down (in order of my dining experience): Nutty Loompa Bread: TOTAL FAIL. I have had free bread that tastes better than this. Don't let the fancy descriptions fool you. This is plain tough (but warm) wheat bread loaf served with 2 spreads: whipped butter with a few flakes of bacon, and a pickled raisin jam. Passable for a complimentary dish, NOT acceptable for $6. Wagyu Tartare: complete waste of good beef. Wagyu pieces were too thin for us to appreciate the texture, plus smoked uni was tasteless and resembled mayo overkill. Beyond that, you could barely taste the apples and shitake. This should be removed from the menu immediately. Goat Empanadas: could taste the goat flavor, but it was nothing special. The sauce around it was overpowering and just felt like the empanadas should be served alone with a dipping sauce instead. Braised Beef Tongue: beef slices were tender and well seasoned, but overall a forgettable dish. Confit Goat Belly: the lobster and crab chunks were a surprise, but nothing groundbreaking. Actual goat belly pieces were average at best. Diver Scallops: Solid choice. Tender jumbo scallops were well paired with pecans and pom seeds to give it a sweet nutty flavor. Brussels sprouts were also a nice touch. Roasted Cauliflower: disagree with all the rave reviews on this one, thought it was too salty. Cauliflower is a veggie that has a natural sweetness that should not be covered up. Sugo: FINALLY something to live up to its hype! Fresh pappardelle in a hearty goat ragu made every bite worth savoring. Flavors were so true, and portion size was generous. This should be a must-have for every (non-vegetarian) diner. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: Did not think they could top the Sugo, and then tasted this. AMAZEBALLS! On this alone, Girl and the Goat would get 5 stars. Meat was so tasty, so tender, and just blended so well with potato, cilantro and the runny egg. Very innovative, very well executed, top-notch presentation as well. Parsnip Cheesecake: goat cheese in the cheesecake was very fragrant, but did not enjoy the gritty texture. Pear and cardamom flavors were well blended, making this a solid dessert choice. Word of advice - enjoy the dining experience but be selective about your dishes. Research the menu and take your waitress's recommendations. Don't ""wing-it"" or you might end up grumpy."
"Truthfully, this place lives up to it's hype. My overall experience here was pretty great.Despite being busy, we were greeted warmly and it is obvious that the hostess desk works as a well-oiled machine. Once seated, my friends and I could see that there was a bit of a time delay on our order... drinks took quite a while to come and our food came almost all at once. It was a bit overwhelming, but nonetheless, the food itself made up for it.We shared a bottle of white wine -- most wines are 40+ dollars a bottle, so not terrible. And a friend of mine also had a cocktail, something like a dark & stormy, which was delicious.We got the pretzel, which was buttery and I could eat 8 of them; the green beans, which were absolutely perfect; the ham frites -- which I liked but could take or leave; the pig face, which I want to eat every day forever; the fried chickpea nuggets (that isn't what they're called, but I can't remember...) which were good but not a ""must have""; and the tempura fish which was pretty delicious and perfectly battered and fried.We also had two desserts -- the pink grapefruit kulfi and the bittersweet chocolate, a perfect combination."
"It is certainly impossible to get a decent time for a reservation! We ended up going for a 10:45pm reservation on a Saturday night. When we got there, the place was completely packed except for one table of 4... which was for us!Here is my review for our 10 dishes (split between 4 people, 2 girls and 2 guys):Escargot Ravioli- We were pretty disappointed by this, would not recommend it.Chickpea Fritters- My favorite!!!! DELICIOUSDiver Scallops- It only comes with 2 and is like $17. I personally am not a scallop fan so I thought it was o.k. but I liked the vegetables around it. My friends who like scallops said it was delicious.Pig Face- Also my favorite! HIGHLY recommend!Pork Belly- Pretty good!Beef Tongue- Pretty good, just tasted like beef.Octopus- Not bad, tasted like a normal octopus dish. My fiance thought the octopus was too hard and overcooked though.Lamb- It was very weird. Came with some chips and a tiny bowl of raw lamb pieces... it was ok..Sticky Date Cake- Very good! Very sweetMini Butterscotch Budino- Also very delicious! Would be perfect if it didn't have cashews3 floyd's zombie dust beer- My fiance said it was absolutely delicious!Our bill was about $180 for 10 dishes and 3 drinks. We left by 12:45am. It was a great meal!"
"Been wanting to try this place for a year.Here's what you need to know:1) You can't get reservations cause they are super super booked right?. Try walking in at night around 9. They usually say they have bar first-come-first-serve bar seating, but If they have regular seats available they'll fit you in. That's what happened to us.2) Like others have said, it's overpriced. Their portions are small tapa sized, which average about 12-15 bucks per dish. We had the Diver's Scallops, Roasted Cauliflower, Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. All of which were just meh.3) Bathroom is downstairs4) People say try the bread (it's actually reasonably priced, we didn't try it, but you should and let me know if you like it. I kind of wished we did)5) Waiter was friendly6) Seating is a bit tightBottom-line: Overall, I am happy that I got to try this place out, but I was not even close to being blown away."
"After booking months in advance (and still only getting a late reservation on a Wednesday), I finally made it to Girl & the Goat.Being the Top Chef fans that we are, my sister and I had been looking forward to this for a long time! Â Firstly, walking in, it seems like a cozy yet trendy atmosphere. Â Dim lighting, dark wood, it all had a rustic feel to it.We started with the steamed mussels and the goat carpaccio. Â They gave us a huge portion of mussels (and we realized at that point that, wow, we ordered too many dishes), and the flavor was nice -- the only complaint was that I could only have so much of it by itself because it became really salty.. definitely order bread if you're gonna get this dish. Â The goat carpaccio was unexpectedly good. Â I'd never heard of anyone doing goat carpaccio before, and this was a risk that was well-taken. Â Light, sweet, and nice.We also got the pigface that everyone raved about. Â This was good, sweet, and perhaps one of my favorites of the night, but I think again, could've used something to cut through the dense flavor.Everything was solid, but overall, things were a bit overseasoned. Â I thought it was a great place, but I left not quite understanding the hype. Â It was good, but it didn't knock me out like it seemed to do with everyone else."
"If there was ever a restaurant that earned every single piece of a praise that it has received, Girl & The Goat is definitely that restaurant. Â  Â  When we decided to visit Chicago for my 30th birthday I knew that I wanted to celebrate at Girl & the Goat. I reserved a table a month in advance and when we arrived I could see that I made the wise decision in doing so, they were packed. Â The bar was full of Chicago hipsters and business professionals. Â The booths and tables were full of couples on first dates and girlfriends out for dinner. Â We checked in and pushed our way to the bar where we ordered two Brown Sugga's. Â We were sat for our table within 20 mins of checking in and were greeted by an enthusiastic server who explained the menu in detail to us. Â We told him this was our first time here and that we weren't sure when we would return so he made some suggestions of what we shouldn't miss. Â We started our meal out with wood grilled broccoli with rogue smokey blue and spiced krispies. Â Incredible char and flavor and the krispies were a nice surprise of texture. Â Just as we were finishing up with the broccoli they brought over grilled octopus and surprised us with the diver scallops. Â  The octopus was incredible but the diver scallops were phenomenal. Â I am so glad he gave those to us because he said ""we really shouldn't miss these"" and he was right. Â They were the best scallops I have ever eaten.Because Yelpers suggested it so highly we ordered the Pig Face and boy do you Yelpers know a thing or two about Pig Face! The fried egg on top of pig cheek was the most incredible way to close out that insanely delicious meal. Â Flavors, textures, everything was right on point. Â We were stuffed and ready to close out the night when our waiter returned with pumpkin gelato on the house. Â I can't tell you enough how amazing this meal was. Â Every little detail was done perfectly. Â I doubt I will return to Chicago without planning another meal at Girl & The Goat...."
"Absolutely spectacular!! Â I can't wait to come back to Chicago to eat here! Â Amazing food, great service, fun atmosphere, basically everything you want in a great eating experience.HighlightsI love any place with the Pegu Club or Smocking Jacket on the cocktail list, they know their stuff!Bread - order the aMAZZing with avocado yogurt and romesco moleRoasted Beat Salad - great starter, refreshing, and creatively dressed.Sauteed Skate - maybe the best fish dish I have ever had!!Pan fried frog legs - were excellentSugo - This dish is a must order if its on the menu when you go!Confit goat belly - very tasty, nice way to finish off the meal. Â I would spend a week eating here every day just to try everything on the menu. Â If you are like me and you travel to Chicago for work, this isn't a place to eat, its THE place to eat."
"Everyone told us to go here so we came for an early dinner on a Monday to avoid the crowd. The hostess was very accommodating and we did not have to wait long before being seated, even though we had no reservations. Intimate setting with both tables and bar seating. Casual enough to have discussions with your party as well as people seated around you. We ordered the following plates:Thai chili and ajowan bread- bread was great but the hummus was even betterRoasted cauliflower- made with pine nuts and mint. Refreshing way to balance all the meat!Wood oven pig face- tender and fatty meat. The sunny side egg on top was a peculiar choice. Braised beef cheeks- the fried rice and onions reminded us of Asian fusion cuisine. Unexpected but tasty. Goat belly confit- the best dish in my opinion. Goat belly was amazing and the crab meat was a wonderful complement. Butter sauce was unbelievable. Definitely get this. Girl and the goat Petit Verdot blend- a rounded red with a berry finish. Recommended. Unfortunately they aren't allowed to sell bottles or I would have taken a few home. Since these plates are mostly tapa sized, I recommend getting 2-3 per person. The service was almost too good. Someone was always available to help us, take our plates, fill our glasses, etc. Bottom line: The best meal we ate in Chicago."
"Perfect for those who want to feel like they are being adventurous without actually being so. Food is good, I'll strictly give that a 4, and I feel it earns that. Portions are small and some are hit or miss, some are great. You spend alot and I'm not sure you get that much for it.Pig face is good, but its basically just calling barbacoa ""face"" to get people to feel like they are really special eating it. Just think well made barbacoa with an egg on it and you are 90% there. Alot of out-of-town people demand to go here and Ill take them, but its just not as good as the hype, and I think Chicago has better/equal food for better value. I'd bet the diner across the street is the real gem here."
"Should I move to Chicago just so I could eat here regularly?? Â We split a bunch of things - potato bread, beet salad, green beans, salmon (with sausage!), goat belly (with lobster!), PIG FACE, goat cheesecake, etc. Â Best meal of my life... the mix of flavors and textures was just incredible.Recently, I sent my friends here as a wedding present because they were honeymooning in Chi. They loved it, too! Â And, the staff gave them some complimentary champagne which I thought was a lovely touch.Note - it's hard to get in. Â Either book your reservations waaaay in advance, or just try to come early-ish and get a seat at the bar. Â Trust me, it's worth it!"
"We came here on a Saturday night with no reservations. Yikes! I was surprised they let us wait for a table... we waited for 2 hours. But had a great time drinking cocktails and eating bread at the bar. Really nice atmosphere. For a nice place like this the service was great the bartenders are super nice and friendly! The hostess even double checked with us if we still wanted a table given our wait was so long. We didn't mind. I have been wanting to try this place since the hubby and I watch every episode and season of Top Chef, Top Chef Masters, Top Chef Just Desserts... you get the idea. Their mojito's are excellent, they use fresh mint! Once we were seated our server asked if there was any dietary restrictions or allergies that they need to be aware of. I have never been asked that. That is so nice. Also, you just order what you want and they bring it out to you in the order they see fit for you to best enjoy the meal. We ordered Roasted Cauliflower, Chickpea fritters, Pan fried shishito peppers and Mushroom bread with tomato puree. For dessert we shared bittersweet chocolate and ruby red grapefruit kulfi. The food was excellent! My two favorites were the chickpea fritters and cauliflower."
"AMAZING. This was one of the best meals I've ever had. Our server, Alison, took it from being a great restaurant to one if the best meals ever. She suggested dishes we would never have selected on our own."
"OMG...where do I begin? My boyfriend and I had one of the most amazing food experiences we've ever had this past weekend at Girl & the Goat! Thanks to my amazing friend Dan, who is a chef at G&G we got a reservation at the chef's table (#5 I believe) at the last minute. I feel pretty lucky considering it normally takes months to get in here...Just walking in here was an experience...the smell was unbelievable, the design and decor of the place was beautiful and seriously just perfect. We started at the bar while our table was getting cleaned up. I ordered some type of grapefruit and vodka cocktail from their menu and it was delicious! So good I had 3 of them throughout the night! But let me get to the best part...the food! There is a lot to write about so I better get to it!We got to try lots of different items from the menu, so I will tell you a little bit about each one:The cauliflower: had mint, pine nuts, and pickled peppers in it. Super tasty, definitely one of the better cauliflower dishes I've had.Shishito peppers: one of my favorites from the night, cooked with miso and parmesan. I've never had a shishito pepper and they are absolutely delicious! The green beans: yes, they are as good as everyone says they are...cooked with fish sauce and served with cashews and some sort of mayo. Definitely the best green beans ever!Hen of the woods mushroom ragu: I don't even like mushrooms and this dish was amazing. They are served with a sweet potato ravioli and a palomino tasting sauce (not sure what it actually was though) that is SO good! Sauteed Prawns: with peanut-pork ragu and spaghetti squash was a whole new level of how to prepare shrimp...wow! Cooked to perfection with so much flavor.Steamed mussels: these were the largest and most tender mussels I've ever had. No grit whatsoever. My boyfriend doesn't even like mussels and he loved this dish. They come with goat sausage croutons and a caesar type of dressing and some amazing broth at the bottom of the bowl. YUM!Sweet n sour cod cheeks: Never had cod cheeks before, but damn these are good! Would have never thought to order this, but the chefs suggested it so we tried it! Man, am I glad we did!Goat chorizo flatbread: This is definitely a MUST HAVE! I think this was my favorite of the night...I wished I had more room in my stomach so I could have eaten the whole thing. I honestly have no idea what the sauces were that they put on there, but the flavor was out of this world! It comes with fresh ricotta and julienned apples. The combination of everything together is beyond perfect.Grilled pork ribs: Another favorite of the night, super tender, caramelized and yummy! Served with salsa verde. Kalbi style beef ribs: Super flavorful, but slightly tough. I don't even like sweet potatoes but these were amazing (I believe a lot of butter was used).Goat belly: honestly (and surprisingly), was our least favorite dish of the night. I'm not sure if it was because we were expecting something like pork belly, but the flavor just wasn't there. Obviously the lobster and crab served with it were delicious. This dish was really good, just not quite as good as the others. There was a lot to compete with!!Our service was impeccable from beginning to end. The hostess was super nice, coming over to us to let us know that the couple before us was just getting up and that our table would be ready soon. Our server (forgot his name) was super sweet as well. He wasn't as knowledgeable as I thought he should have been about some of the items on the menu (didn't have a clue how to describe loup de mer), but he was great otherwise. If you are planning a trip to Chicago, do yourself a favor and make a reservation here! They really live up to the hype. I would really love to try the goat leg next time if I come with more people, it really looks amazing. I know I will be returning every time I come to Chicago! Thanks so much for making our night so much fun!!**Just a tip for those of you who plan to sit at the chef's table (or whatever you call the table that is right in front of the kitchen). Bring the chefs a bottle of bourbon or tequilla...you may or may not get extra special service ;) it wouldn't hurt to try!"
"Although the people were very friendly, the service was very professional and the environment was very modern and clean, the food was mediocre at best. Â The ""pig face"" which was the most recommended dish on the menu was like eating pure pig fat mixed with a half raw egg. Â In fact all of the meats on the menu were mostly fat and grease, not at all what I expected, considering the amount of time I had to wait for a reservation, the amount of time we had to wait to get served and the price. Â The breads were ok and the best thing on the menu was the cauliflower. Â The wine list was also very nice, but the mixed drinks were disappointing as well.I don't know why so many people say this was great food. Â Maybe eating greased up pig and goat fat is an acquired taste or maybe I just came on an off night, who knows. Â I just know that for the time and price I was not pleased at all."
"What can I saw that hasn't already been said?The food was fantastic and the server was attentive. Â Amazing wine menu and a plethora of delicious cocktails to keep everyone happy.You must try the cauliflower, it's amazing."
"Certainly a spot that lives up to the hype. We were somehow able to score a last minute res via Opentable. The point of my review is to tell vegetarians that this is still a great spot even if you don't eat goat! The veggie dishes were all so flavorful and the chef definitely took some risks adding different flavor dimensions vs. just doing simple roasting dishes. Some of my favorites: cauliflower w/ peppers/parmesan/pine nuts/mint, squash wontons (not fried), and kohlrabi salad (normally I don't love creamy dressings but this one worked great with the dish). The only dish I didn't love was the scallops because I think they may have added an anchovy (fishy) sauce, but others at my table enjoyed it."
"I arrived at 4:20 and found a seat at the bar per a tip I read. Â Made friends with the group next to me and we proceeded to share a good portion of the menu together. Â We all loved everything. Â The Crisp Braised Pork Shank was my favorite. Â Also enjoyed the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. Â The draft beer selection was limited, and the house red wine was good. Â When I'm in Chicago, I'll be sure to return."
Holy amazing. I usually sit at the bar to get the helpful insights and a little conversation. The food was amazing and the chit chat was great. Didn't miss a beat on any of the dishes. The cocktails seemed a little complicated without being overly exciting but I stuck with my glass of wine and did just fine. Take the time to enjoy this place. It is worth a leisurely pace for a meal.
"Food was good, and the place had a good ambience; if the service would have been a little better, I would have given 5 stars."
"This was a fun birthday treat with my husband and parents. We made reservations 3 months in advance for my 7:30 Tuesday night birthday dinner.PROS:-The food was delicious and unique.We were all pleasantly surprised at the variety and inventiveness of each dish. Although it's a shared plates experience, all 4 of us left very full since everything was rich and bursting with flavor. (Dieters beware... Go in knowing you will not be able to count calories. Enjoy and savor the comfort-style food.)-Well-paced meal with a lot of food runners bringing your selections in a seemingly strategic way.- Beer list: Extensive. All the staff seemed to know about all the drinks so that was helpful.FAV DISH(ES):- Pig Face: Sounds gross, but is delicious. It's almost like a comfort breakfast food.- Walter's Chicken: So good, juicy, and portion is generous! - Diver Scallops: Such a medley of creative flavors - walnuts, pine nuts, pomegranate seeds - yes please!- Ham Frittes: This dish takes french fries to another level.- Cauliflower: So good. Yes, it's a bit salty, but they are cooked to the perfect texture and wonderful flavor!CONS- LOUD: We could barely hear each other across our 4 top table half booth table. I was left with a hoarse voice. - Service: We had to wait about 1/2 hour past our reservation and had to keep checking in at the host stand since they don't come to find you when your table is ready. The host staff also gave off the vibe that we should feel privileged to be there. Really? We saw our waitress 3 times- once upon greeting 10 minutes after we arrived at our table, once to take our order, and once to deliver the bill. I had to flag her down to get another drink throughout our meal (all our ordered drinks were low), and the food runners did the rest of the work (kudos to them, they keep the place going!) I'd go again for the food. I just will make sure to chat it up before dinner since when you're at the Girl & The Goat it's all about the food!"
"Oh man, amazing. Â Reminded me of some NYC places but with a Midwestern sensibility, especially with the service. Â Really conscientious, knowledgable staff. Â We had a very demanding group of people, we were entertaining international clients, and were a table full of food and wine professionals ....and Girl & the Goat helped us look great. Â Truly a flawless meal. Even when we were full we couldn't stop eating b/c everything tasted divine. Â I will definitely repeat when in Chicago."
"It just doesn't get much better than Girl & The Goat. Every dish we ordered was simply fantastic. The Pig Face and Beef Tongue are must tries, and anything with goat (as you would suspect considering the name) is delicious. Great wine selection as well. And on top of it all, service was impeccable. I would definitely recommend this place for anyone who is visiting or lives in Chicago. I would highly recommend getting a reservation, as this place is very popular."
"One of the best restaurants I've ever eaten at! My group (6 people) made reservations 3 months in advance. May not have been completely necessary that far in advanced, but we didn't want to risk it. We ordered the green beans which were exceptional. They were very flavorful and still a little crisp. We also ordered the octopus, pork shank, Brussels sprouts, goat liver mousse, kohlrabi salad, and scallops. Everything was delicious!"
"One of the best meals I've ever had. Â Granted, it was over a year ago, but I can write about it like it was yesterday because it was just THAT good!First off, we rushed in here (group of 4) on a quick break from our conference. Â We had little time to eat and wanted to try it all. Â They sat us immediately and understood we were under a little pressure to get in and out. Â They gave us little plates so we could share everything family-style. They brought everything out just as it was ready and we chowed down.We had the following dishes:- sauteed green beans (first time I've had green beans that I liked, and I actually loved them)- wood oven roasted pig face, sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, and potato stix (the guys loved this one)- seared tuna, lamb sausage, grilled blueberries, and pepitas- goat empanadas - hiramasa crudo, crisp pork belly, aji chili, caperberries (I'm not a pork belly fan, but the guys loved it)- ham frites with smoked tomato aioli and cheddar beer sauce (simple and delicious)- goat chorizo flatbread, ajvar, peppers, green tomato, apricot, fresh ricotta (another amazing goat dish)- goat cheese bavarois, brown sugar cake, citrus blueberries, marcona caramel - bittersweet chocolate, shiitake gelato, toffee creme fraiche (yes, a mushroom ice cream - unexpected and tasty)- pork fat doughnuts, honey yogurt, carmelized figs, lemony eggplant, ham streusel (another unexpected combination for dessert, and quite yummy!)Stephanie Izzard was expediting, which was cool to watch. Â She was right behind us actually, so we could hear her call back the dishes. Â She rushed our order knowing we had to get back to our conference quickly. Â She even took the time to pose for a picture with me after dinner.Overall, it was a great dining experience, and I hope to visit again next time I am in Chicago - hopefully a little less rushed than the first time."
"My wife and I celebrate here as often as we can...anniversaries, birthdays, whatever reason we can find. The food is delicious and adventurous. If you are willing to trust the Top Chef winner, Ms. Izard will not disappoint you on any portion of the menu. We prefer to get 4-5 of the smaller dishes and try one of the many unique desserts that pop up. Â Our favorites are the beet salad, goat belly, and crispy pig face. However, I can't say we've been upset with a single dish we've ordered.If you see it make a return, the quattro leches dessert is absolutely addictive, like a bowl of sugary creamy cereal with crunchy and moist cake textures. For now, the miso-butterscotch budino is my favorite (I'm Â a sucker for anything with bacon and the bacon toffee adds just enough salt to counter the sweet richness of the budino and candied pineapple)."
"A must try for any foodie. The menu is out of this world, if a bit rich, but hey I'm not eating here to support my diet.After making reservations two month's in advance, I noticed quite the line on Friday night and was prepared to belly up at the bar for a bit. I was surprised when we where sat right away and where told that they saved the best table in the house for us. They sat us on one of the two tables on the cook line. My girlfriend and I agreed it was a bit awkward at first, but after striking up conversation with the kitchen staff it became evident that they were going to hook us up. We ordered 6 dishes ourselves and were floored when they gave us another 4 on the house! Part of me doesn't want to tell the world this, but hey it's pretty damn cool. I could go into details about the menu, but really everything was awesome. A couple high notes; goat belly? Yes please! The tartar was also fantastic with the uni cream sauce. Make sure to grab some of their fresh baked bread too. My girlfriend can not stop talking about the kohlrabi salad. All in all quite delectable. Plan ahead, it is worth it."
"Had an excellent dinner the other night thanks to Girl & the Goat! This tapas style restaurant has some excellent food in a very cozy setting. We had a reservation at 11:30pm (yes they seat people that late), and the demand for this place is very obvious. The food was excellent! Around 6-7 dishes for 3 foodies seemed like the right amount. Plus they have some great service. Very friendly, and very efficient! Like I said, the atmosphere has dim lighting, great music (included some old school RnB!) with a loft kind of feel to it.Try the clams, any of the goat dishes, the cod cheeks which is a play on fish n' chips was also excellent! And for desert, the ginger cake with the sorbet was AMAZING! Would definitely go back to try more of the menu!I wish Stephanie I. would have come out, so I could ask her out myself...maybe next time!"
"FINALLY made it into this place after talking about wanting to go for years.1) High compliments on the music - mix of Miike Snow, The Cure, Sting/The Police.2) Great decor/atmosphere - I really like the dark, black, burnt-then-lacquered wood shooting up the wall in the center mixed with the bright, surrealist-inspired-acid-trip paintings on the wall. 3) Bus boys and chefs are sexy.4) The fucking food. Â I don't even know how to describe it. Â Escargot ravioli, goat empanadas, scallops with pomegranate/brussel sprouts. Â How do you even disguise that bitter pomegranate taste? Stephanie fucking did. Â The dessert was this wild apple granitas shit. Â Who knows how that works but it was weird and awesome. 5) The price - I was amazed that it was *marginally* affordable (for the quality). Â Three people, 6 cocktails, 6 courses, bread and dessert all under 200 with tip.shit.yeah."
"This place is amaaaaazing. My husband and I ordered the pig face, goat empanadas, and pork shank...pork shank was so good we ordered it twice. I wish the pig face was a bigger dish. Next time I will get my own. The drinks were great as well. Â We had 4. We had the bolt and best of three. We had the bittersweet chocolate for dessert. ..OMG OMG..... just amazing. I do wish the portions were bigger..Except for the porkshank. It's big enough. Â Unfortunately we can't eat here often because of the price....about $180 including tip....but we'll be back next time there's something to celebrate!!!!!"
"Was quietly hoping for this to be the best place we have eaten at here in Chicago, but it was still very good. Â Chickpea fritters, beef short ribs and the pretzel bread were the winners; scallops and goat empanadas were very good and a brownie ice cream dessert was tasty. Â A little loud and a little random (Beastie Boys, then Arrested Development, then country?), but otherwise excellent. Â We had to wait about two months to get a reservation during the week that was between 6-9 PM, so unless you want to saddle up to the bar and/or go early, make that reservation now!"
"Amazing food. Wait time is famously long -- but my boyfriend and I got early dinner and Â walked right in. :)Must try - the roasted cauliflower. Seriously this is the best vegetable dish ON EARTH - so perfectly roasted and buttery and garlicky. Ahh.Actually everything we tried here was delicious. Pig face was surprisingly delicious and savory (it's basically crispy bacon), goat empanadas as well.For the quality of the food the price is fair, but I wouldn't wait 2 hours for this though. I have a fundamental dislike for ""tapas"" places here in the US - small portions but price points are for entree level - their portion sizes here are small, not good for sharing.Still giving it a 5 though just for the cauliflower and pig face. Damn."
"Possibly one of the best food experiences I have ever had!!! Tremendous flavor, texture, service and distinct flair. Servers were very attentive, my water glass was never less than half full, and our waiter was enthusiastic about helping us choose delicious dishes. We ran into some traffic and arrived late for our reservation; they hold your table for 15 min, but thankfully we were still able to nab one.I went in a group of 4 and we all separately ordered a variety of items because some had food restrictions. We ordered:1) pan-fried Shishito peppers2) potato wontons3) pan-roasted halibut4) salmon5) confit goat belly6) goat empanadas7) bread with thai curry8) oven-roasted pig faceDessert: a special of goat milk cream, brown sugar cake and blueberry compoteSpecifically, I tasted the shishito peppers, halibut, goat belly, pig face, and thai curry bread. Everything was extraodinary, full of flavor and tasty!The shishito peppers has a lot of peppers in a small bowl! more than we expected, nicely roasted but quite oily.Halibut was delightful, lighter sauces to focus on the delicacy of the fish. Great side of peas and other items.Goat belly was tender, but the pig face is hands-down the winner of that evening for me. Don't expect to see an actual pig face!!! It comes topped with a sunnyside egg, and we were lifting the egg, curious to see something resembling that. not quite...but the flavor is out of this world! I tasted a bit of the salmon - there were so many elements including I think strawberries? But it works! intense explosion of flavor! So if you're looking for something packed with an assortment of taste, this is the one!The dessert was amazing!I've had girl and the goat on my restaurant bucket list for some time now since I saw a yahoo review of the top XX number of restaurants in the country. It has definitely lived up to its expectations. If I am ever in Chicago again, I will definitely come back!"
"I'd been wanting to try Girl and Goat forever, especially after loving Little Goat. I was a little afraid it couldn't live up to my expectations, but instead it blew them out of the water. This was one of the best dining experiences I have ever had. If you're fortunate enough to go here in a group of two, request Table 5. It's set up at the chef's station and you get to watch the chef's prepare all the dishes. They talk to you throughout the meal and offer you samples to try. At no extra charge, it's an incredible, unique experience.Now to the food. We had bread, the shishito peppers, halibut and pork shank. We also samples the salad and cauliflower. Everything was incredible. If I had to recommend one thing, I would pick the pork shank - amazingly tender and crispy.The restaurant is trendy and laid-back. The staff is friendly helpful in suggesting how many dishes to order (the menu is designed for sharing) and times the delivery of each dish perfectly."
"If you can get in, it's quite an experience. Best to go with a group so you can try more dishes. Yes, they charge $4 for bread for the table. It's very tasty. Favorite dishes include roasted cauliflower, diver scallops, duck tongues & confit goat belly. All are outstanding."
"The BOMB........Noise that is..We really enjoyed all of the food and drinks. Service and staff were great and friendly but you've got to be kidding on the volume of music.If you like yelling to be heard across the table this is the place for you. I'm sure if they turned the music off Â for just a minute they would get a standing ovation from everyone (including staff) in this place.We arrived early for a 6:15 reservation to grab a drink but they said we could have a table immediately so we were seated. Wasn't full yet so thought we could take our time and enjoy.Ordered a couple of ""Spanish Harlems"" which were great and tasty but not strong.Beet Salad (my wife's fav)Not Campbell's bread........fresh and hot with mushroom/tomato spreads.Roasted Cauliflower (my fav and couldn't eat it all)Scallops for me.......incredible yummy with pumpkin flavor etc.Mussels for the wife....good portion.Bittersweet Chocolate dessert with shitake ice-cream. Nice.Waiter is at first .....""take your time""....then shifts to ""order now"". We weren't loitering so no need to push.Anyway if they don't turn down the volume they won't see us again and we came all the way from California."
"Really lived up to all the hype. We went to celebrate a birthday with a gaggle of unfocused eaters. Worry not, the staff was able to corral the 10 of us to a table and got the spectacular spectacular that was to be our dinner, underway. Everything was explained in full detail but wasn't over wheeling. Our server was a patient as can be with our incessant questions and side comments. Amazing time and would go back in a heart beat. Half the table commented it was the best meal of our 2 week trip! Â Also love that they rock De Leon. Absolutely made the evening. Mahalo goat staff!"
"""I want to bathe in this sauce""""I want to motorboat this skate""""I want to curl up into a tiny ball and cry while I eat this"" ---were all said while dining at the Girl & the Goat.If you have no reservations, just go in when it opens, and they will happily seat you (after telling you what time they need the table by.. but no worries, it's enough time for 5 plates and a dessert and coffee, without being rushed). Mark B and I were sat on the communal table, in front of the kitchen, so I silently freaked out while I followed Chef Izard's every move. I love love LOVE the decor--especially the shelving above the open kitchen--I WANT. But that's not what I'm here to talk about... let's get to the food!For 2 people with a large appetite, I'd say that 5-6 dishes will do the job... and here were our choices:-aMAIZing bread with avocado yogurt spread-crispy skate with grapefruit on a delicious puree with delicious sauce (yeah.. it was so good, it was a blur)-goat belly confit with crab, fennel, and almond butter-seared diver scallops with squash, bok choy and pizza poofs-pig face with sunny side up egg, tamarind, cilantro and potato stix-butternut malasadas with bourbon gelato Â and brown butter applesIt's too bad they didn't have pork fat doughnuts anymore--it sounded delish.From our little spread, I'd highly recommend the skate, goat belly and pig face. The scallops, although perfectly cooked, I found that I liked because I like scallops... not because the flavors were mind blowing. I would also not skip the dessert, if I were you!I would definitely make reservations now! But, if you find yourself in Chicago on a whim, then I'd definitely get to Girl & the Goat when they open to get some noms worth every penny."
"A great dining experience. Something I would say everyone should try if you are in Chicago. You need to do it with a group of people. I stop short of giving it 5 stars, though I oddly feel pressure to do it. Everyone talks about how amazing it is and I have to agree now that I tried it. You have to start with the empanadas as they were one of the best things I have tasted in quite some time. The sauce and veggies that were served on top if them could not have complimented the dish any more. Each item that came out was unique in its own way, which helped to make it a great experience. The wontons were great and the mushrooms served with them may have single-handedly changed my opinion on mushrooms. I certainly preferred the lamb ribs over the beef ribs and would suggest you just go with those. I even tried to steer clear of dessert but had to try the PB&J when it was ordered by others in my group. That was amazing and I am still not sure how they got the tastes and textures exactly the way they did. As for the only negative part, I can simply say that one or two dishes of the 8 or 9 we got (small plate style) were just not that great in my opinion. In particular I will say the ham frittes were the least favorite item of everyone in the group. I would not tie up any space in my belly by trying these when everything else was so great. I will also say this dish and several others were overly salty. I get that ham is salty, but this was almost unbearable. Much on the other food was salty too. I could tell I needed to down a couple bottles of water before heading to bed as it was almost too much in a couple spots. The service was fantastic and the staff knows the food very well. They were right on with recommendations and nailed the beers, wine and drinks. It is definitely worth the trip and very enjoyable with a good group of friends. Enjoy."
"I made the reservation for a party of 3 about a month in advance. We went in on a Monday and the place was nicely full, but not packed. So, I'd say if people are dying to go here, go on a weekday when it's easier to get a table. We had to sit and wait to be seated since our 3rd guest was a little late. But, they have a nice waiting area and let you take some menus to look at which probably saved us a lot of deciding time at our table haha. To be honest, I was reluctant to buy a drink here. They serve the same cider I buy at the grocery store and one bottle was the same price as a case. Just to feel like we were getting our money's worth, my girlfriend and I ordered cocktails instead. She had the ""Mayan Miscalculation"" which I tasted and it was very good. I had the Â ""Blood & Goats"" Also very good, but for me it was a bit strong. Peer the recommendation of our very friendly waitress we ordered 6 plates to share. From the vegetable menu we got the fried pickles. GET THESE. They are delicious and according to the waitress they have been newly added to the menu. They used to be a secret side dish for certain orders. Get them while they are on the regular menu!!!From there we got the pig face, the goat empanadas, potato wontons, pork belly, and something with octopus or squid, I can't quite remember. From this list, I would recommend the goat empanadas for sure. I wish we'd just ordered two plates of this really. Then the pork belly was a hit for all of us. Everything was delicious, but those two dishes were just sooo good."
"5 amazing stars. One of the best meals of my life. Girl and the Goat captured my heart and was one of my Chicago trip highlights. The ambiance inside is perfect. Large enough to be spacious and lively without being loud. Beautiful dark red brick highlighted by florescent lighting, an open kitchen where you can spy the girls and the goats. It's trendy but not pretentious, dark but not sleepy, vibrant and throaty and beautiful. Â The service is fantastic, and as we were lucky enough to grab bar seating had an intuitive and attentive bartender who kept the wine flowing. The food, oh the food. Eat the pig face and don't be scared. It's crispy and soft in all the right places and covered with that egg is the best dish of the night. The goat belly is delicious as well, but surprisingly two other favorites of the evening was the asparagus...and cauliflower. If you can make cauliflower with such intense, lemony and savory flavors, and can make me choose it over a meat dish you deserve 5 stars. I can see why the wait is 2 hours+ for a table and people keep coming, I can see why the reviews are so high. I can see why the chef won Top Chef. I will be back every time I am in Chicago, without fail.."
Excellent food and service! They have their specialties that you can't find anywhere else. Food portion is not big so you get to try out different dishes even you have small party.
We are fans of this restaurant. Â The service and food is excellent. Â It continues to draw diners for all over the city and burbs so don't think about walking up without a lengthy wait. Â So how is it that you really get reservations?
"As a big, big, big Top Chef fan, I have to admit my expectations for this restaurant were too high. Â I've only been to one other ""Top Chef restaurant,"" Harold Dieterle's Perilla, which was AMAZING, and so perhaps I set up an unfair comparison in my head in advance. That said, however, I was kind of surprised by how many plates at G&TG were merely ""good;"" I had expected them to be much better than good.Plates:Goat Liver Mousse - it was fine but not much different from a chicken liver mousse. Â The crumpets served with it were also... fine. To me, the most outstanding items on this particular plate were the pickles (!) My mother thought it was the marmalade. So basically, the main ""dish"" as it were, was upstaged by its condiments.Duck Tongues - they tasted like bacon. Â I think if any small piece of meat were cooked the same way (deep fried), it would taste the same. Â I'm glad I tried them, though.""Magic"" Green Beans - these were absolutely delicious. Its ""secret sauce"" is a fish sauce and there was an aioli on it, too. Lots of calories for a vegetable dish, however. I had the remaining beans (about 1.5 cups) wrapped up and ate them the next morning over scrambled eggs. Â Leftover Heaven!Chickpea Fritters - boring, boring, boring. Â And a little bit tasteless. Â I feel like something went wrong with our order.Mussels - another delicious dish, and the mussels were huge. Â We also went out of our way to soak the remaining bread from the mousse in the sauce.Diver Scallops - the scallops themselves were fantastic, but the greens they were served with were a bitter contrast that kind of killed the sweetness of the scallops. For dessert, my mom got a grapefruit compote dish (there was more to it but its name escapes me), which she enjoyed. I opted for a maple bourbon cocktail which was very good but hardly unique. My sister opted to skip dessert since she was so full.Overall, G&TG has a great vibe, and is worth the cab trip to get there. It's funky and energetic and a great place to try some unique items. Â I wish it were more consistent but it was a fairly good value for the taste and amount of food we got."
"What can I say that hasn't been said before? The food is very flavorful & inventive. Aside fr the pig face and cauliflower, I wasn't wowed by our other dishes. My bf really enjoyed the lamb shank which did not smell or taste gamey at all. Unfortunately the non-fatty parts were a little dry in my opinion. I really liked the richness of the pork belly but my bf felt it tasted too strongly of fennel. The sauce actually reminded me of a doughnut. Maybe I was just expecting more due to all the previous reviews. The food is good, don't get me wrong. Just not mind blowing. The tables can be quite close to one another so be prepared to converse with your neighbors. Our waiter was very animated and kept us entertained. I was pleasantly surprised at how reasonably priced most of the dishes were. Overall a good dining experience."
"Getting a same day dinner reservation at ""The Girl and the Goat"" is next to impossible, unless you've the habit of eating your dinner after 10:20pm, at which point ""The Girl and the Goat"" will still ask you to make a reservation, but you wouldn't have wait for 2 or 3months, which I'm sure a lot of you will attest is simply too painfully long to wait. But once you're seated, shown the menu, briefed on how to order, and start eating is only when you'll realize why this place is super busy, why the long wait times, and why everyone who lives in Chicago loves to eat here. I'm no big fan of vegetarian food, but the roasted cauliflower was simply amazing. I had no clue that a boring vegetable like cauliflower can be turned into something so edible and so delicious. And the goat empanadas, so succulent, tender and tasty that they immediately beg you ask why, why is that there are only two in a plate? Now coming to the roasted pig face, the item that every one raves about was simply not that great. I mean the presentation and all was good but I wouldn't rank the pig face that high on the list of items I love here. We also tried the wood fired Walter's chicken, which I liked but was a little too sweet for my buddies' palate, and the tempura loup de mer filet, a white fish fried to crispy, golden brown bedded in a delicious crÃ¨me sauce, was definitely worth waiting for. By the time we finished our meal and couldn't eat anymore, the desert menu showed up. And no one at our table could resist the temptation of the bitter sweet chocolate; and so we gave in, one last time, and ordered the bitter sweet chocolate cake and we were not disappointed. It had the right amount of sweetness coupled with bitterness and the moistness of the cake to give it a flavor that finished our meal in a nice way."
"First and foremost, Make a Reservation! This place if popping!I made reservations back in September for my one year anniversary on Tues, Nov 29 but the only time we got was 9pm. The day before my reservation, I went back to Open Table website and saw that there was an 8:15pm on Thurs, Dec 1 and modified my reservation for that time.I guess that's my tip for everyone: Make a reservation and look into modifying it just before your reservation because you might get a better time/date. Late Tuesday night dinners don't work for this working girl.Anyways, let's talk about my experience. We used valet for our car because parking is rare; don't worry it only cost $10 + tip. We went straight to the hostess and got seated right away.Our server was Kyle and he was pretty awesome. He recommended great beers for my husband and a nice glass of wine for me. I think one of the beers my husband got was Stone Indian Pale Ale and I don't remember the other one but it's both IPAs. I got the Riesling which was good :)Let's talk about food (in chronological order when they came to our table): 1. Follcocia [sorry for the spelling lol] - my husband's favorite and my second favorite, bread + mushroom butter + red onion jam 2. ham frites with cheddar beer sauce + smoked tomato aoili - it was ok...a little too greasy 3. korean kalbi beef ribs - it was ok, i've had way better 4. sweet potato au gratin - my husband looooved it, but for me it was too cheesy 5. saved the best for last: wooden oven pig face roast (don't be schocked by the name because there are no eyes or ears, etc) - this was my favorite because i love me some good pig, highly recommended!We ended with a blood orange sorbet which was yummy!!!Our bill came to a little bit over $100 with tip which is not bad for what we got. I definitely want come back :)"
"I was really looking forward to trying Girl and the Goat after all the hype about this place. Â Also I've been to little goat diner a bunch of times and love it there so I figured it would be even better. Â Honestly, I was left a bit disappointed.I came on a hot, crowded summer evening right before a concert at the united center. Â The staff were very friendly and sat us right away after we told them we were in a bit of a hurry. Â The menu does change a lot, but the only thing I ordered that I genuinely enjoyed was the scallops- they were perfectly cooked and a good size portion for the price, along with unique flavorings to top it off. Â Everything else we ordered was strange. Â It seemed as if the chef was just trying too hard to come up with weird flavor combinations. Â I am no stranger to trying unique tastes/combinations of food, but everything we ordered just seemed excessive/overpriced. Â The escargot ravioli were overcooked and bland. Â The breads with spreads were nothing special. Â The goat empanadas were not too flavorful. Â And while I wasn't a huge fan of the pig face, the other people I was with did like it a lot. Â Overall, it is definitely a place I would come back to if the opportunity arose but not somewhere I would wait months for to get a decent reservation time."
"After hearing about Girl and the Goat finally decided to try it out one evening and I have to say I was very impressed with the menu. Â We tried so many dishes and every think was excellent. I specifically enjoyed the beet salad, lamb ribs and the pork! The ambiance was very nice and the service was very friendly. My only suggestion is for GATG to slow down the serving time between the dishes! We felt rushed with so many dishes being served together back to back so it felt like an eating competition."
"It's taken me two weeks to decide what I wanted to say about this place and to reiterate the greatness that has already been stated and hush the negative reviews of people who simply don't know what they're talking about.This place was one of the best meals of my life and I eat well. Â I made reservations a couple months in advance for a party of two. Â We were seated on the line - I was stoked! It was a treat to watch the kitchen work together and produce such beautiful dishes. Â The staff worked in perfect harmony. Â I downed my first aviation rather quickly, maybe too quickly, and it wasn't long before someone, not our server, but an attentive team member, asked if I was interested in another cocktail. Â Of course I was.This has been said over and over again but do not, do NOT, skip over the vegetable section. Â Our favorite dishes were the green beans and kohlrabi salad. Â Not to be missed. Â Everything we tried was amazing but the goat belly confit with bourbon butter, lobster and crab, was PURE DECADENCE. When we gave our order to our server I noticed that she took special considerations in our dish selections and factored that into the order which the received the dishes; the goat belly being last. Â Dessert is also not to be skipped. Â In fact, just get all of them.You really can't go wrong here and with the team that Stephanie Izard has assembled, you will have a personalized dining experience with the utmost attention paid to everything."
"Got lucky and was able to get a table with no reservation by walking in at 10:15pm on a Monday night. I've been dying to try this place and it is definitely worth trying. If you like pork belly, you'll love the pig face. The arctic char was also delicious. But the fish roe on the goat carpaccio wasn't necessary and the kohlrabi salad was drenched in dressing and it unexpectedly had olives (not listed as an ingredient on the menu). The shishito peppers were also tasty but oily and cheesy (they made for better leftovers once I blot some of the grease away). The chocolate dessert was so-so with an unusual shiitake mushroom sauce.The cocktails were good - so I may return for drinks.... and for the pig face."
"People are going positively apeshit over this place, so I had to try it on my quick weekend trip to Chi-town!4 week wait for a res? No matter. We will just go in for an early (5pm!) dinner. Their menu reminds me a bit of Ma Peche in NYC. Or maybe this is a trend; where they just note the components of a dish but you never really know how it's going to come out. I like that. There's an element of surprise to it. Everything on their menu was amazing. Small plates. Wonderfully inventive taste combinations. We tried a variety of stuff- Notables were the Tempura Loup de Mer, Pig face, braised beef tongue. Â I hear their menu changes often, but I trust everything is always spectacular. The desserts were amazing, and I'm not even a dessert person. We had the Rub Red Grapefruit Kulfi and the Bittersweet Chocolate. The chocolate was so light and rich at the same time. Definitely save room. Great farm-to-table type ambience and friendly service. Would definitely come back."
"After trying to go here on 3 different occasions over a period of about 4 months, I was afraid that all the build-up would end up letting me down. I was however EXTREMELY impressed with this place. It lived up to the hype!We made reservations on opentable, so they sat us right in front of the kitchen which definitely distracted my husband, however it was pretty cool to see things as they came out. This definitely influenced our ordering process (and delayed it because we wanted EVERYTHING that was coming out).The food is delicious, innovative, and not super expensive. The staff is excellent - providing good recommendations and very attentive. As a bonus - they brought over some free dishes which was just the cherry on top for the 5 star review! All in all we ordered a bottle of wine, 4 small plates and a dessert (they threw in a free small plate and dessert) and the bill was just under $150 which is pretty reasonable considering how great the food was. Great atmosphere, great food, and ever changing menu.....every reason to go back soon!"
We went with a group for my husband's 29th birthday. It was our first trip and literally everything was amazing! Best plan is to all pick a couple things on the menu and share across the table so everyone can get the most out of the experience.
"After living in Chicago for a few months now, you don't not hear about the Girl & the Goat in reference to restaurants. Time and time again, I've been hearing ""have you tried the Girl & the Goat"" yet and it got slightly frustrating considering you can't get a reservation for months in advance. Not to mention, after grazing through the menu online, I just thought it may be another overrated restaurant that people just feel the need to talk about. Boy, was I wrong! This is truly a must-try! Well, my boyfriend and I finally made the decision to go after knowing that he got off a flight late and we wouldn't be able to get dinner until 10:30ish. We called a few days earlier to see if they had a reservation that late and of course they didn't (their last reservation was at midnight, and that was taken). The host did tell us how they have 3 sections reserved just for walk-ins (outside, bar, front) though so we thought we would spin the dice. To our amazement, we got there at 10:30 and got seated outside right away! When sitting outside, it's picnic-style so you sit on top of the people next to you. Which isn't horrible as we got to talking to some nice people and bonded over what each person got. A small note is you can't be sitting outside at midnight, so if you're still eating, they will move you inside. This wasn't a problem at all though! The food. I was very pleasantly surprised at how amazing every single dish was. And my other surprise- the portion sizes! Normally at these types of restaurants you get 1 tiny piece of what you ordered just to have a taste and you spend an arm and a leg for that tiny morsel of food. Here, the sizes were great! We ordered 4 dishes for 2 of us and you nearly had to roll us out! And it wasn't as pricey as you would imagine either. So very happy about all of the above. My boyfriend admitted that this was one of the best meals he's ever had, and that says alot! We ordered: - SautÃ©ed green beans - very delicious and surprisingly generous portion! Sauce is different but good and the peanuts were good addition as well - Squash blossom rangoon - yummy! they gave us 3 big rangoons and that was plenty as because they are fried they are pretty filling. A unique spin on crab rangoon and it really worked! - Wood oven roasted pig face - okay, you cannot come here and not get this. I admit, this scared me, but this is one of their most popular items so we couldn't resist. And I tell you, it was amazing! Chop it all up and mix together and every bite is a treat! Very clever ingredients in there and a must-try. - Goat empanadas- this was more delicious than I had thought! Happened to be my second favorite dish! - Drinks- I got the Best of Three and I loved it! It was really delicious and perfect for a summer night. My boyfriend got one of the whiskey drinks but didn't seem too impressed, especially it being $15, he had high expectations. Due to the generous portion sizes, this was enough food but also gave us a good range of the menu to try, so I was satisfied. All and all, what a great experience and now I will be one to say ""have you tried G&G yet, because it's unreal and definitely not overrated"". I can't wait to have another late dinner so I can try other dishes on their menu!"
"This is the most AMAZING late night diner/modern friendly city/brunch bit of deliciousness ever!My husband had the fat elvis waffles, and i'm not normally a sweets person, but HOLY COW IT WAS DELICIOUS. Â Yes, indeed it deserves all caps. :) I'm glad I don't live down the street, otherwise i'd be here far too often."
"TA DIE FOR!!! seriously, i love this place. i've been there a few times and have tried almost everything on the menu now, and it's all amazing. even the pig face (i know, sounds gross--tastes amazing). the decor is really cool also, and they have delish beers and wine. they even have a gluten free menu which is pretty much everything on the normal menu, just modified slightly. love love love this place! its hard to get a reservation and always packed, but you can snag a seat at the bar or couches and have the full menu there. i actually find eating at the bar more fun. on multiple occasions, everyone sitting next to us started chatting and before we knew it, we were all sharing food. such a great place! i highly recommend it to anyone who loves good food!"
"I won't get into too much detail on specific dishes since a large portion of the menu changes on a fairly regular basis. Â What I will say is that each and every dish I've had has been well thought out and for the most part, succeeded to some degree (obviously, some more than others). Â The sauteed green beans are a Girl & the Goat staple and deservedly so, and the grilled baby octopus is a personal favorite.The atmosphere is always buzzing, the decor is clean and interesting, and the chef's table is a must-do if you ever get the chance. Â Do yourself a favor and just make reservations two months in advance on OpenTable so you don't have to wait two to three hours for a table or eat at 4:30/10:30 pm on a weeknight."
"Awesome! We made a reservation as soon as we booked our trip 2 months ago- that got us 5:45 on a Sunday. We checked today to see if anything else opened up and the next reservation was a month and a half from now at 4:45! Atmosphere was great- trendy, revamped warehouse feel. We started with a Paloma cocktail and I had the vodka, Pimms, cucumber dink. Both were right on spot. To eat we tried the carrot bread, Halibut, pork shank, goat belly, and cauliflower. All of them were incredibly delicious. The halibut had a strong vinegar flavor, which I thought was a bit overpowering, but my wife loved. The pork shank was a huge portion, but I came close to licking it off the bone it was so delicious. We branched out with the goat belly, but it was fantastic- not too strong in flavor and covered with crab/lobster. Cauliflower was probably the best preparation I've ever had. We're definitely coming back here on our next trip to Chicago!"
Absolutely amazing. Â Mouth-watering meat that just melts when you take moments to chew. Â Requested a birthday dessert for my friend and the server came out with a big surprise! The staff are amazing and good at what they do! Â Someone always came to refill the water and people were conscious to serve us our next orders when we were done with our last.
"I liked every dish I had at Girl & the Goat. Out waitress was extremely helpful and it's a fun atmosphere to enjoy with friends. I'd definitely recommend the following:Sauteed Green Beans, I really want an ""at home version"" of the sauce it's doused inEscargot RavioliPan Roasted Rushing Waters Trout, the grapefruit added a surprisingly pleasant flavor.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face, an obvious must tryCrispy Duck Tongue, my favorite, the flavoring doesn't really compare to anything I've had before.Make sure to call in at least a month ahead of time to get a reservation, and try as many plates as you can."
"Anyone who ranks this less than 5 stars has stunted tastes buds and absolutely no appreciate for creativity and culinary execution. Congrats to the executive chef, bartenders, and line chefs. Wow. We tasted most things on the menu and several cocktails and didn't have anything disappoint. As they change the menu seasonally, exact reviews won't help. Open your palette and mind and go with it."
I must say that the GM got in touch with me right away about my review. Which was truly appreciated. The fact that someone was willing to talk to me about my experience is showing extreme professionalism. That in turn makes me think that maybe I came in on an off day.I gave it another go and I really enjoyed the food.
"We went last night after making reservations almost 3 months ago-we ordered the first 4 vegetarian items on the menu and 2 fish dishes, the onion brioch (OMG!) and a butterscotch pudding dessert that was light and amazing ....everything was pretty generous in size and the flavor combinations were phenominal. Â I was pleasantly surprised when the waitress offered to pack up our leftovers as this usually doesn't happen in trendy places.....but food waste is a travesty, especially when it's this delicious! Â Also, if you only get one mixed drink, get The Tempest....which is a fancy dark and stormy. Â It was good as a similar drink at The Violet Hour but without the cool giant ice cube.I do eat fish but if you are a vegetarian or prefer veggie based dishes, this restaurant is GREAT!!!!"
"The hubby and I wanted something different this year for our anniversary, so he made reservations (3 months in advance!) for us. Â My son has eaten here and one of his good friends knows Chef Stephanie Izard. Â Well....let me tell you.....!The hostess greeted us with ""happy anniversary, folks!"" when we checked in. Â We had about 1/2 wait for our table at the bar, but we were that early. Â Almost 5 minutes after our actual reservation time, we were seated by another hostess who wished us happy anniversary!Gary, our server, was wonderfully attentive and also wished us a happy anniversary when he came to our table. Â He made some suggestions, but we were adventurous enough to start the gastro-trip on our own.First came the goat carpaccio - ooh, mama! Â This was served with toasted trout roe and frizee - My only wish was that there was another slice for the price ($25). Â A tiny ripoff on this one, but forgiven for the flavors.Next up - warm marinated olives. Â Yummy! Â I loved these little delights, but the hubby wasn't blown away by them. Â We then tucked into the roasted beet salad we both felt was superb with it's subtle white anchovy avocado creme dressing.From the sea came the diver scallops with pork sausage shitake mushroom sauce and butternut squash - sublimely flavored. Â The grilled baby octopus with celery root, braised pistachios and lemon vinaigrette was tender but way too salty for me, but again, forgiven and I just won't order it again. Â From the meat choices, we ordered sugo, which we learned was a word for ""sauce"" - in this case, pork rich with gooseberries over pappardelle pasta - so good with the savory of the meat sauce and tart/sweetness of gooseberries - a veritable flavor of explosion once the two meet! Â We also ordered the braised pork shank which could have done it all on its own without the two sauces - the butternut squash kimchee was a no-go, but the little bit of naan was a warm treat. Â At this point, we knew we were on the way to feeling too full, so we bagged up the pork for home so we could sample some sweets.On to dessert - hubby didn't want to share his pumpkin pie gelato with rum spice cake. Â I didn't care 'cause I got the bittersweet chocolate cake with shitake gelato (yes, it actually worked together!). Â l didn't want supersweet as some cakes with gelato can be. Â It was perfect - just bittersweet, I could have licked my bowl clean!The nicest thing about dinner was they comped us for my dessert as a way to wish us happy anniversary.When we left, we made reservations for the spring so we can sample the seasonal menus and asked that Gary take care of us (at his suggestion, of course!). Â They made a note in our file (we're on file, now!) and said they're looking forward to seeing us again.We're really looking forward to the menu we'll have for our next trip to this fabulous place! Â Best make reservations as the walkins get put on a waiting list and it looked pretty long when we saw it. Â They seat reservations first."
"Oh, Stephanie Izard ... where have you been most of my adult life? I've marveled at your culinary adeptness from afar. Oohed and ahhhed during your cameo on last season's Top Chef All-stars. But yet nothing could have prepared me for the delight of dining at Girl and the Goat.A friend invited me on this taste-filled journey during the summer and it has introduced me to some delectable frenzies including:* pork fat doughnuts--crispy exterior and fluffy doughballs of goodness injected with a homemade blackberry filling. The subtle hint of bacon-y goodness was only further accentuated with a side of caramel vanilla ice cream, chocolate ganache, streudel crumbs and fresh blackberries.* sauteed green beans--tenderly sauteed and flavorful with the fish sauce vinaigrette and cashewsThe hiramasa crudo with crisp pork belly, aji chili, and caperberries; escargot ravioli and smoked goat empanadas also were amazing.Girl and the Goat is definitely not to be missed. Chef Izard, if any of these items are in your cookbook, I'm definitely hunting a copy down!"
"Natalia was my personal angel tonight, and for that I thank her.I find myself in Chicago in an accidental, yet fortuitous, departure from NYC. Â I had been recommended to visit G&G before I left town, and since I was here, I figured I'd go ahead and walk on over.The cocktail menu is solid. Â Natalia started me off with a gin based cocktail, and we moved through some others before settling on the ""double barrel"" which really stood out as the star of the night.The food menu is ... interesting. Â I'm a fan of octopus, but not of baby octopus. Â I'm a fan of pig, but not so much of ""pig face"". Â Perhaps on a better day I'd feel more adventurous, but today I really needed something more comforting, and I found it in the scallops and cauliflower. Â Both were stunning.I guess I arrived a bit early (I'm still living on Eastern Time), and found a seat right away at the bar. Â As the evening progressed, the place really filled up. Â If you're in a group of more than one, I expect a reservation would be in order.High points:- the food- the drinkLow points:- none I can think of.Unfortunately, this might be the last visit I get to make to Chicago for a while. Â If I'm ever back, this will very certainly be on my list to visit again."
"For me, not so much.. What is so impressive about this place? I asked the waiter what was a ""must have"" dish at this establishment and he said the pork face dish was the most popular. This consisted of crispy pork cheek with an egg on top served over potato strips. Bacon and eggs? The most popular dish? Sorry, but i'm not impressed by this. Another popular item that people rave about: the bread, which they bake themselves. It's good, but again, should I be impressed with bread? All in all, Â I sampled 5 dishes and only one of them (the goat heart) was something I really enjoyed and would order again. The rest were mediocre. Perhaps I ordered the wrong things, but I did ask the waiter and in a place that has almost 2000 yelp reviews, and almost 5 stars, there should be no wrong dish. To boot, we were packed in like sardines. Sorry goat, but all hype in my opinion, which is worth what? Nothing!"
"This is the BEST meal I have ever had. Â Was it cheap? Â No.Was it worth every penny? Â HELL YES. Here is a rundown of all the things we had: Goat Empanadas - I really didn't think I would like this as much as I actually did. Empanadas aren't my usual ""go to"" food because it reminds me so much of like Taco Bell, but this is top notch delicious. Â  Escargot Ravioli (they brought to the bar, on the house) - the bar tender knew my food allergies and before I consumed it she made sure I could eat it first. Pig Face - what a fun play on breakfast! Â They roasted pig face to the point where it tasted crispy and bacon-esque. Â Paired with a sunny side up egg, it was like eating breakfast for dinner. Roasted Cauliflower - Â this was recommended as one of the more popular dishes on the menu and I was skeptical. Â But after tasting it, it was very clear -- the flavors and textures were miraculous -- the mint goes so well with the cauliflower and the pine nuts gives the dish such a fun crunch. Braised Beef Tongue - so tender. Â The salsa verde compliments the richness of the meat. Â Goat Cheese Cheesecake -- very playful, the goat cheese served as the cream cheese part and they used a brown sugar yellow cake bottom. Â After all was said and done (and 2 rounds of cocktails at $12 a pop), our bill came out to be $100+ per person before tip. Â I am already thinking about making my reservations for my next trip out to Chicago and that's not at least for another 6 months!"
"Officially one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Â My boyfriend and I began a little culinary week for my 30th birthday, and GATG was our first stop. Â What a wonderful experience! Try the crudo. Â Try the oysters with bacon. Â I can't remember the last time I moaned over my food before dining here.Om nom nom!"
"My review is two-fold: first for the food and second for the service. I honestly wish that I could submit two separate reviews because the food deserves 5 stars. Â I enjoyed some of the most unique foods delivered in the most approachable fashion. Since visiting, I have relished every opportunity to discuss the delicacies I enjoyed: pig face, escargot ravioli, goat heart, kohlrabi salad, wood-grilled broccoli, etc. My husband and I went with friends who enjoy adventurous food and I could not have been more proud that I recommended trying Chef Izzard's restaurant.As for the service, I could not have been more embarrassed to have brought people here. Â While there were several things that disappointed me, there are 2 that stand out:1. When we sat down, I asked if our waitress could describe a few wines that sounded interesting, she curtly responded, ""All of our wines are good"", as though I was questioning the quality of their wine list. After that brash remark, I asked if she could recommend a wine based on the food we were ordering. Before we even told her what we were ordering, she said, ""Everything on our menu is so diverse, so there's no way that I could possibly recommend one bottle for you.""2. After we had gotten all but one dish, a busboy came by and starting picking up our plates and silverware, I mentioned to him that we were waiting for one more dish, our salad which surprisingly did not come out. I thought that perhaps the salad was considered a palate cleanser or something prior to dessert. Right after I said this, our waitress walked behind me, never acknowledging us, and simply said to the busboy, ""No mas."" He proceeded to clean off our table. A few minutes later, our waitress stopped by the table and asked what was the problem. When I brought up the missing salad, she asked, ""Are you telling me that we never served the salad?"" I said yes. She then turned to the rest of the table and said, (this is an exact quote), ""Are we all in agreeance that you never got the salad?"" We replied, yes, but our reply should have been, ""Are you seriously questioning whether or not we're telling the truth regarding salad?!"" Later when we received the bill, I noticed that the salad was listed very last on the check, so it seems like she simply forgot to put it in. Â If that is true, I wish she would have told us that rather than question our integrity. Â Besides these 2 major concerns, the waitress never visited our table, did not serve us any of our dishes, and never asked how our wine or any dish was.Food-5 starsService-1 star"
"8 weeks before my trip to Chicago all I could get was a 10pm reservation on a Thursday. Â It was a little annoying. It was almost so annoying that it distracted from the cute decor and atmosphere when we arrived. Â G & G had a laid back vibe but it felt special, some guy was wearing a T shirt and a trucker hat. Gabriel, ecstatic, started rattling off small plate orders ($11-$18) to our waitress; I got tense. ""Gabriel don't forget I'm on a budget."" ""Scott if we're gonna splurge let's splurge.I've been looking forward to this all day.""We decided to split up into partners and order that way. Gabriel and Allan got the bowl of baby octopus first, which looked great. They scarfed it down. Then our squash blossom crab Rangoon came out. Â Now they were jealous. Â Each plate was unique, fresh and flavorful; a sweet surprise, and each different dish was brought out by a different beautiful earthy but beautiful boy.""it's like thanksgiving."" Gabriel gawed in cloyed satisfaction.""it's like Christmas."" gael C-ed him. Gael and I also chose lamb heart skewers with fig, the scallops (2 for $18) the bloody Mary bread, and the chocolate dessert. Â Service was exceptional. Â They changed our plates out for each new dish promptly. Â You can go crazy here - it's a perfect gastropub. Â Our tab for 4 was $300 before tip. Â No beats were missed. Â We had a blast.trendy/casualsmall plates at $11 and uploudplan on spending around $60 per person as a base"
"When you're celebrating a new decade in style and you decide to skip the whole party scene, what do you do? Even if you live in Van., even if you don't get to eat your food until around 10 pm--you come to Top Chef, Stephanie Izard's, G & TG, that's what.Extremely friendly staff, huge welcoming space. Bathrooms located as far away as possible from most places in the restaurant which was weird and a bit annoying. Order:Chick pea fritters in Mozarella-THAT is a fritter. Absolutely amazing. We could have had five orders of those.Diver Scallops served on Duck confis-our least fave. dish. Scallops were fine, but the duck confis was not necessary. Did not add to the dish; actually detracted from it and we did not enjoy it. This one was a bit of a miss, even for self-professed duck fans. Perhaps they listened to our suggestion; I see that now they serve them on foie gras confis!Shortribs-I thought they were delicious, although I notice that they are not currently on their menu. Cheesecake- precious, little goat cheese, triangular, cheesecake, and one of the best that I've ever tasted. Beautifully presented. Another chocolate dessert was almost as good, although I can't even remember what it was! *Note* - Sadly, although we told the resto why were here when we booked our reservation, although everyone was friendly, etc, they didn't even offer a bday drink, tiny taste of celebration, nothing. I was a bit disappointed since in such a beautiful city with the friendliest people ever, I was not made to feel special at all on a pretty big day. For that reason, there are a few other restaurants where we dined in the area that I felt were equal if not better than this famed chef's establishment. Too bad for us, but then again, it gave us a chance to try even better restos in the area, too."
"Believe the hype. We had a wonderful experience. Of course, one must go here expecting to spend the money. Great food served in generous portions - I was expecting tiny little plates, but nope, the goat shank is, well, it's a giant piece of goat. My fiance and I ordered 5 plates and it was WAY too much food. We should have done four, and with the right combination, we would have been happy with three.Also, when I made the reservation on Open Table, I simply stated in the optional comments box that we were going to be coming from an engagement proposal. I wasn't really expecting anything, but wow. They welcomed us with ten different congratulations and complementary champagne, they sat us at the chef's table, and the owner came over to offer her kind words. Wow. I looked like a stud. Five stars."
"Wow! This venue is busy! It is also very well staffed. The interior is very dark and rustic, minimal but comfortable. I was in a party of 10 diners. Patrick was our server and he was very attentive and friendly. We had preordered a leg of goat. Each of us ordered a side dish. We had the cauliflower, broccoli, fried pickles, and a couple of other sides. They were all very delicious, but the grilled broccoli was really detectible and the favorite. The bread was very crusty, chewy, and perfect.We were a little disappointed when the leg arrived, it looked small. There was more than enough for everyone, but somehow we thought it would be larger. The leg was perfectly roasted, tender, moist, and falling off the bone. It was truly delicious, melt in your mouth wonderful. I could have eaten much more, but I am trying to keep my model physique, so I held back. The desserts were also very good looking; I did not have one. The coffee was a good finish.Now the negatives. The place is too noisy! I could only hold a conversation with the person that was seated right next to me. I could not hear any of the others. There was music being played that could not be heard. It should be eliminated. The source of the rest of the noise, diners, kitchen(which is wonderfully exposed for all to see), air conditioning, etc. could be minimized with a better acoustical dampening ceiling.It is also really expensive. I am a parochial school teacher, so I do not have much income.I parked 2 blocks away for free, and it was a pleasant evening for a walk. Valet parking is available for $10."
"Oh my god! Â Absolutely delicious!My wife and I joined a couple of friends there the night before we had to fly back from the holidays.As Boston is our current home for the last two years, our visit to Girl & The Goat reaffirms the absolute primacy of the Chicago food scene. Â It makes Boston a complete and utter amateur hour of restauranteurs that either want to imitate/move to New York or have decided that lobster mac and cheese is the penultimate food item. Â Of course there are exceptions, but in general....Every single plate from a simple bread course to the sugo(sp?) which was like a deconstructed ravioli using goat, beef, and pork were simply amazing. Â Prices are not asinine (Boston...looking at you again) and even the cocktail menu was quite creative and good with craft liquors and even blenheim ginger ale.Our server was spot on in recommendations and very friendly. Â We did not manage to get a table in the dining area, but the lounge area opened up nicely and we got some space at the low tables that were just the tiniest bit too low for extreme comfort, but really we got to share our plates easily, with no pressure to eat and clear out. Â Our neighbors even offered to share one of their courses with us. Â The lounge just encourages socializing and I would, without hesitation, be willing to sit there again.Go here and find out what great food can taste like without paying through the nose... Â Simple seeming ingredients that are just cooked to perfection."
"Another wonderful experience at the Girl and the Goat. They have not disappointed me yet! We arrived without reservations but were able to do a walk-in (we arrived early around 5pm and the restaurant was pretty crowded). The menu is always changing, but this is what we ordered: fried oysters which had egg salad and capers.walu (very flaky and moist fish)beef tongue (super tender)roasted cauliflower (my favorite and has always been on the menu every time I come)dessert--whipped goat cream with sugar cake and blueberry syrup and toffee crispEvery out-of-towner I have brought here has loved this place and can't stop thinking about the food after having eaten here! Cant wait to come back again!"
"A month wait to get a reservation...nonsense...just go before 4:30 and quickly walk over to the lounge waiting area. Â We got a nice couch and immediate service. Â Service: Â Amazing. Â Our server was great even with the busy crowd and took care of us. Â I would come back here simply on the service. My less than par rating on this restaurant has to do with portion size to price point. Â I guess I expected a little more, but I understand that the nicer the restaurant...the smaller the portions. In terms of taste, delicious but not amazing. Â Roasted Beet Salad was fresh and great. Â I am a BIG fan of Beets and Beers. Â Pig Face was delish. Â I have no standard for Pig Face so I can only say that it was simply delicious.The Goat Belly dish was my personal favorite, however it was the portion was the size of my thumb. Â The scallops were HORRIBLE. Â Bland, tasteless, and the squash does not complement the scallops very well.Overall great environment, food, and experience...however being a big boy I could not justify starving all the way home after 4 plates and a large tab."
"Reservations are probably a good idea! Â Call more than a week in advance, because it was all booked even 4 days before my friend and I went.Walked in on a Friday night with no reservation, but within a few minutes, my awesome friend was quick enough to swoop on seats that opened up at the bar! Â The vibe here is very unique; it felt like a mix of old and new rustic, but I enjoyed it.We got:Not Campbell'sWood Grilled BroccoliDiver ScallopsWood Oven Roasted Pig FaceCrisp Braised Pork ShankNot Campbell's was ""soup"" bread that came with tomato oil and mushroom butter, and I don't think I've ever ordered bread off a menu, but it was quite good with the butter it came with. Â Supposedly they're known for bread, so yeah, get some?Wood grilled broccoli was the bartender's recommendation. Â Not bad, really just broccoli with a little char to it.Diver Scallops, another bartender recommendation, were probably the best I've ever had! Â So good... I wish I had ordered more! Â I remember them being somewhat expensive... but I love scallops, so whatever.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face you just HAVE to get. Â I think everyone defaults to it because of it's popularity, but it's popular for a reason! Â If you didn't tell me it was a pig's face, I wouldn't know, but it tastes like a chewier low fat, low sodium bacon. Â I throughly enjoyed it. Â Do try.Crisp Braised Pork Shank was really unnecessary, but we saw it being delivered to another table and just had to have it. Â It's just as the name says, crispy on the outside, and perfectly braised on the inside. Â I recommend saving some bread from earlier to make mini sandwiches/bruschetta =pI think the bill came out to about $100. Â Worth every penny for the food and company! Â We did end up taking quite a bit back to the hotel, as the portions are generous enough. Â Definitely one of the eating highlights in Chicago!"
"I had always wondered why this place was so hard to book a reservation and now I know why.My dad was in town visiting and I wanted to take him and my brother somewhere cool that we had never been to. Everything from the interior, menu selections, and staff was spot on. Alyssa the manager is so nice and was very accommodating for our party. We decided to get 5 plates and just share. We got the squid, pork belly, fried pickles, roasted pig face (one of the best things I've ever eaten) and a pasta dish with goat. And then we got two deserts, a blueberry date rum cake and then some sort of pineapple butterscotch cobbler. AWESOME!if you live in Chicago, make a point to go here...now!"
"Perhaps the best New Year's Eve ever! Â The staff was amazing, always pleasant and helpful. The food was great, passed goat loin, pot stickers, shredded beef, it was all amazing. Highly recommend!"
"** LOVE *** pretty much everything about this place -- most of all, the food. Â What the chef does to broccoli is not to be believed....smokey bleu cheese, beautifully cooked, absolutely spectacular. Â Also a big fan of the goat empanadas (YUM) and beef short rib --- tender, flavorful, delicious. Â The decor is very appealing Â -- great design details and modern/cool while still feeling very warm and inviting. Â My only complaint is the wine pours. Â During my visit, both my dining companion and I felt they were very skimpy. Â At $15 a glass, I would appreciate a bit more than two tablespoons. Â (Might also note that our server, though very friendly and generally competent, would do well not to repeatedly mention to female diners what ""good eaters"" they are. Â LOL. Â Not exactly what a girl wants to hear. Â He also was not very attentive on the wine refills (as I mentioned, two tablespoon servings go fast). Â He did, however, bring us a complimentary dessert (we are, after all, good eaters :) Â ), so I should be nice. Â Service was overall very good.)"
"One of the best restaurants I've ever been to. I went with a party of 4 and got to try about a dozen dishes, and several cocktails. Each bite (or sip) was amazing. Dishes are creatively crafted, with ingredients that are top notch (straight from the farm). Care and quality from the food, service and decor."
"Girl & the Goat has certainly raised the bar for a 5 star review.I'm not sure that I've ever enjoyed a meal more.I had something to say after every single bite.MMMM.... WOW..... This is INCREDIBLE.... I've never loved fennel, but I love it now....The goat empanadas sooooo perfect.... NOM NOM..... YUM..... Oh my gosh this is the best food I have ever had.....The tip about going at 4PM without a reservation worked for us.We were seated, fed the best food of our lives, and out of there by 6 which works for me because I love early dinners. :)"
"So I finally went! After waiting 3 months for a 7 pm reservation for 2 the day had come - my cousin and I were off to Girl and the Goat. We walked into a dark and cozy atmosphere with an exposed kitchen and lots of open space. The servers and host staff was knowledgeable and pleasant. Making a quick dash downstairs to the bathroom I was impressed! Individual bathrooms with totally cute decor. Yeah... I was impressed by the bathrooms... so what?Sitting down we ordered champagne and wine to celebrate the occasion of a ... Tuesday night. Why not?We indulged in some sourdough bread with beer cheese spread and butter followed by a beet salad (which I have had better elsewhere, but it was still good)We decided to get a flatbread with peppers and goat chorizo topped with shaved apples. The red pepper sauce overpowered the dish but none the less still delicious if you like red pepper!We ended the night with the pork shank - oh my gosh becky... amazing. It is slow cooked and accompanied by truffled apples... truffles apples!? It was truly an amazing dish. Of course something sweet to follow we got something chocolatey that satisfied us.Overall it was a great night. No complaints - just nit picky stuff. I would suggest eating here at least once!"
"I don't believe I give too many 5-Stars out to restaurants, but I think, I will have to give one to Girl & The Goat. Â This restaurant hit on all cylinders for me, with maybe, the exception of our waiter, who wasn't awful, but was inattentive to my table, unlike the other tables he was serving. Â Thankfully, his food runners were very good at their jobs and were able to fulfill the needs we wanted met that, obviously, our waiter could not meet.A special thanks would have to go the the host/hostess staff and the person in charge of them. Â We came in, without a reservation, just after 4:45pm and were hoping to be seated. Â Girl & The Goat is a busy and very booked restaurant so I advise out-of-towners to reserve in advance. Â To our surprise, the restaurant just barely opened, and started to pack in already. Â The person in charge of the host area was awesome. Â He said he could get us a table just as long as we promised to be out by 6:30pm. Â No doubt, a table reserved for that time slot. Â An hour and a half to finish a meal should be easy right? Â Not so easy when it comes to this restaurant. Â If we had time, I think I would have loved to have stayed longer.As for the food, BRILLIANT!I might have had a small complaint of one of the dishes my table had, but with the numerous amazing dishes we ate it's easy to forget what small complaint I might have had. Â We ordered the following including dessert:Culture Club, $4Green Beans, $9Chickpea Fritter, $11Goat Carpaccio, $12Octopus, $13Beef Tongue, $14Pig Face, $16Confit Goat Belly, $19Doughnuts, $8Bavarois, $8You can't go wrong with orders here. Â You order a few, try them out, see if you like them, and order some more. Â The thing is, most of the dishes we ordered were pretty damn good. Â So, one day...maybe, ordering the entire menu will come into fruition, but for now I'll tuck it in my 'bucket list'.Cocktail-wise though I wish they had served my Realm Of Reason, $12, in a martini glass instead of a highball glass or had some garnish that made it standout as a cocktail that says, 'Realm of Reason'. Â Otherwise, I love the drink...'it will get you there!!'.Girl & The Goat gets me there! Â It's a Chicago icon like Wrigley Field from my POV. Â This restaurant is amazing!"
"Besides the wait, this restaurant is top-notch. The menu is very easy to understand, and the fact that they expect you to share everything makes this the perfect get-together place. My favorites include the cauliflower and the goat empanadas. Their stringbeans are really good too if you don't mind them a tad on the salty side. Don't worry, almost everything will invigorate your tastebuds, and that's great.They have some very nice deserts too. I'd definitely try to get a reservation or to go at a time when you expect there to not be too many people."
"Meh. Â It is alright. Â I am probably one of the few that didn't think it was all that amazing. Â A LOT of hype and the place to be at the moment (or it was when I went over a year ago). Â It was not bad, don't get me wrong but I've had better meals elsewhere for sure."
"I like G&TG, I do. But it just isn't all it is hyped up to be. Not to mention - I really like Maude's across the street - and so I suppose I was holding it to their standards. Pros: - Busy. Really Busy. Even on a week day. I like that - the bustle and noise is exciting. - The cauliflower. Very good - definitely try this. - The bar. - The bread - our favorite part. Cons: - The service. We got seated 20 minutes past our reservation time, and waited another 10 to be greeted by our server - who then expected us to be ready to order. It was our first time there and we thought we could get some suggestions, run down of the menu, etc. She seemed annoyed by this. She also seemed annoyed that we wanted to put in an order of bread to start before we ordered the rest of our meal. She said it isn't done like that and we are to order everything at once and she will decide when we get what. Thing is - we were starving - and just wanted some bread as we decided what to order. Annoying. She also did not explain the food as it came out. What sauces to use, etc. (Ie: Fries come with 2 sauces...which is which?....Pork Shank comes with two sauces, Naan, and Squash....how are we supposed to eat this?)-Shishito Peppers. The creamy sauce they are in is not needed and weighs down the delicate pepper. -Pork Shank - it was just okay. Perhaps if we knew how to eat it it would have been better - but greasy and tough. Seemed like it had been reheated. -White fish - Very good BUT in a goat chowder. Why? Keep the meat with the meat dishes. Not vegetarian friendly as a lot of ppl say on here. Overall - I will not go back here to eat - only for a drink at the bar perhaps before I go to another restaurant on Randolph where the food and service are both top notch."
"Chef's Table Yeah, we're with the band. I usually expect an uncomfortable two top stacked upon each other when I go out to eat with my wife. It seems to be happening more and more these days and it always gets my goat. Imagine my surprise when the hostess led us all the way to the kitchen and seated us at a couple of high chairs right next to the pass and overlooking the busy chefs in the kitchen. And so began our VIP tour of the Girl & the Goat. We sat next to each other trying to figure out who was Schmoopie and just stared into the kitchen for a few minutes unable to focus on the menu at all. After our server Mark had dropped in a few times, we got on the ball and ordered a few pints of Three Floyd's Alpha King from the excellent craft beer list and got down to business. After much deliberation composing our feast and many distractions watching food be prepared and hit the pass (We gotta get that!) we ordered: bloody mary . worscestershire butter . pickly relish gjetost pancake . heirloom tomato jam . shitake mushroom . black pepper creme fraiche . sauteed green beans . fish sauce vinaigrette . cashews grilled baby octopus . guanciale . wax beans . radish . favas. pistachio-lemon vinaigrette fried soft shell crab . sweet corn elote . chili aioli . seared tuna . lamb sausage . grilled blueberry . pepitas grilled pork ribs . tomatillo-mushroom slaw . grilled scallion vinaigrette steamed clams . rock shrimp . tarragon . fermented black beans . chinese cruller kalbi style beef ribs . corn coblettes . charred okra goat cheese bavarois . brown sugar cake . citrus blueberries . marcona caramel It was all fantastic and there was not anything that we didn't like. There are definitely some interesting things on the menu that less adventurous eaters may shy away from (pig's face, lamb heart). The Bloody Mary bread was really good and a fun concept. The pancake had a goat cheese center and was delectable with the various spread. Grill chef Brian set the tone for a fun night when he heard my Randy Marsh impression ogling the creme fraiche and stepped up with impeccable comedic timing when he asked what to do with his dirty pan. Here's that classic South Park NSFW youtube.com/watch?NR=1&vâ¦ I was pleased that the soft shells were in season and they turned out to be one of my favorite dishes. The tasty pork ribs were to be our last dish, but then the hits just kept on coming and the chefs by us served up a few gratis tasters of the clams and beef ribs. I had eyed both of those, so that was an unexpected and welcomed treat. The kalbi cut of ribs was great, although I preferred the pork ones. The oak burning grill was working overtime right in front of us and the wood smell reminded me of pitmasters hard at work. Speaking of which, it was really a privilege to watch the army of efficient chefs churning out the night's cuisine. They were engaging and welcoming to us and gladly explained what they were cooking and how they were doing it. I did my best to pay attention to their technique and watched as they expertly prepared, sauced, plated and served dishes. They used tongs on everything and what I assured my wife was fat free butter. We got to see most of the menu and we took note of things we may have missed out on to have on a future visit. That would be the scallops, shishito peppers, and goat loin. I had to find a second stomach to put away our dessert. The bavarois with the cake and caramel was a decadent finish that we loved. After our repeat visit, the things we love about G&G are much clearer. Top Chef Stephanie Izzard's menu is well constructed and the smaller sizes of the dishes are ideal for sampling and getting a little taste of a lot of different things. I also really appreciated the design of the restaurant itself. It is casual and laid back with impeccable service. The opportunity to briefly step into the chef's world and watch them go about their tasks was an experience we will never forget. The best part is that this restaurant is right in our hood. That afforded us a much needed stroll through the best restaurant row in the city. Westside!"
All I can say is wonderful!! Â Every thing that we tried was delicious.
"Pork fat doughnuts, blue cheese gelato, salted toffee, honey yogurt = not all together of course. Creative, fun desserts! A must try place if you're in Chicago. To avoid a long wait, make a reservation!"
"A few dishes were great, a few were just okay, and the service was excellent! Great dishes:- Smoked broccoli (large portion for more than two people to share)- Scallops (serves two; one scallop per person. I wished there was more! You must try this)Okay dishes:- Goat carpaccio (tiny bite size that wasn't served with bread, flavor a were clean but left you wanting more. Would not get again- Pork shank (was very tender, but didn't have a lot of flavor, naan bread was good but wasn't a fan of the sauces. Wouldn't get that again either)Great service:- Trevor was our guy! He gave great recommendations and was very accommodating, making sure our drinks were filled and table was cleared for the next dish. He even helped us with other restaurant recommendations for the weekend and set up some reservations! He went above and beyond."
"One word- spectacular. Just like everyone else here, I cannot wait to get back to this place. The dishes are so unique and full of complex flavor pairings. Favorite dishes: Pig Face, Roasted shishito peppers, any of the breads, any of the goat dishes. Sometimes, for great experiences you have to open your wallet a little bit. $60-70 a head for an unforgettable food experience."
"Good job Stephanie Izard. I had a great dining experience here. We did not have a reservation but were able to get seated with not too long of a wait. The evening was rainy so that might have deterred some other walk ins. You could always sit at the bar or the couches if you don't want to wait for a table. Being a fan of the Top Chef series, I was uber excited to try the food that a top chef makes and taste for myself if it just looks good or actually has great flavor like the judges say.I wasn't disappointed. I thought the food was excellent. Dishes were presented nicely and flavors were awesome. All the components in the dishes worked well together to give distinct and complex flavors. One great example is the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts, pickled peppers and mint. It was very surprising. The mint gave the whole dish a very refreshing taste and the nuttyness from the pine nuts worked great with the cauliflower. All dishes are served tapas style so you'll want to share with others at the table and try a wide variety. The server suggested 2 dishes per person, but we were hungry and tourists so even if I couldn't finish everything we ordered 8 dishes + bread. We ended up finishing most of the food because it was so good. Ended the meal with a chocolate bouchon. Superb experience and I will come back for more if I get a chance."
"Despite of food being very pricey, quality is great and their service is excellent. I especially love their bread and dippings. It's an excellent place to bring a date! (Be ready to empty your pockets though haha)"
"This is my favorite restaurant in the city. Granted, this may be a biased opinion since it is in my neighborhood and so convenient for me, but the food still impresses me every time. I have been here over 20 times and if I could share one piece of advice with you it would be: do not bother getting a Â reservation. I have never had one. As long as your party is only 2 or 3 people, getting seats at the bar is easy enough. In fact, I prefer sitting at the bar as it is not so secluded and the bartenders are all incredibly friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. They have a wide variety of drinks to chose from, whether its wine, beer, or cocktails and the prices are appropriate. They also offer the full menu at the bar which is not always the case when it comes to such high-hype restaurants. Although the menu changes frequently, the below are some of my favorite dishes.Goat Belly Confit- The flavors of this dish are so loud and yet somehow work perfectly well together. I would never have expected goat and lobster to complement each other, but somehow they do. This one is on the small menu (which the cheese) so be careful because it is easy to miss.Pig Face- While this is a great dish, I do not agree with all the other reviews that this is the best dish on the menu or ""the one thing to order"". It is savory and sweet (breakfast for dinner) and truly is delicious. You won't regret ordering it but I would pick one of the others that I have listed over it any day.Cauliflower- I have never tasted any vegetarian dish like it. The ingredients change from time to time, but generally there are banana peppers, pine nuts, and bread crumbs (among other delicious additions). Definitely worth a shot.Goat Liver Mousse- If you like pate, then this is a must. It comes with wonderfully warm croquettes which are to die for on their own and incredible once you smear them with the delicious mousse. (also on the small menu)Hiramasa Crudo- A wonderfully light and citrus fish dish. Not too strong of a fish taste so even if you think you do not like fish, I would give it a try. A great item to start your meal with."
"Wow is allI can say We went Monday night. And i wasn't disappointed. Our server was Â Lisa Brown . She knew the menu inside and out We took some of Â her suggestions Â and then some, We had the oysters the hamFrites the scallops, the beef tongue, the soft shell crab( my favorite) the beer and wine list was good and the cocktails were fun too. I recommend the Poloma which is Herradera tequila, St. Germain grapefruit Quite refreshing We tried as much as we could but couldn't fit dessert Â we will be back!!"
"Of course, the famous Girl & the Goat. After two visits here, I will echo all the sentiments around its excellence - not a single item on the menu is not rich and fat-drenched (and I mean this in the best of ways) - yet this is also, to me, its downfall. I know others will disagree, but after more than 8 straight dishes so full of flavor, fat and richness, my palette yearned so much for some acidity and freshness.Highlights: pig face (must try), crudo, goat belly, scallopsCome with a big group so you can try as many dishes as possible. Single bites will do. Make your reservations EARLY.The bartenders are accommodating, encourage conversation and know what they're doing. Can't be missed."
"Girl & the Goat is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. Â I was a little hesitant to go there the first time because I am a vegetarian, and, well, it has the word Goat in the name. Â But the vegi dishes are amazing! Â The shishito peppers with sesame is one of my favorite dishes in Chicago. Â It can be hard to get a table, but my husband and I have had great luck going on the later side and asking for a seat at the bar, where they serve the full menu. Â Enjoy!"
"The BEST meal I had during my trip to Chicago!I had to book a reservation about 2 months ahead and the only thing available to us during our weekend was Friday 4:30pm or 11:30pm.... Of course I opted for the earlier meal, where I considered this my Chicago snack since I wanted to try so many places! We were the first ones there, where the crowd started to slowly trickle in. Â We would of ordered more if we weren't so stuffed and it WAS our first meal of the day, so our stomachs weren't stretched out yet from previous meals of the day. Â I really enjoyed the simplistic wooden decor of the venue, from the chairs to the wooden dish selections that they chose to present their food on. Â The open and stretched kitchen made it more appealing to the public while sitting there and enjoying the food. Â The technique that they served your food selections, at least for the party of 2 for us, was one by one. Â I guess they were trying to have us enjoy the flavorful taste of each dishes since each and everyone of them were indeed very STRONG but DELICIOUS. Â I just wish I had my green beans for example.. with some meat! haha But I still enjoyed it no matter what! We ordered:++ old fashioned bread with bourbon butter and orange marmalade- yes we paid $4 for bread...No free bread if you wanted some. Â This bread was delicious and so worth it. IT came out straight out of the oven, where the bread basically melted in your hands when you were trying to steal it away from your partner. Â The combo of butter AND marmalade was the best, not one or the other but BOTH!++ sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette, and cashews- For some people it may be too salty, but I LOVED IT! Maybe this is why they chose to have us eat each dishes individually. So flavorful but perfectly cooked. Â I usually never enjoy veggies too :P++ pan roasted wild striped bass with brandade, heirlooms, sea beans and truffle-poblano vinaigrette- Delicious first meal to impress the both of us. It was a good amount and I especially enjoyed the sea beans to top it off.++ wood fired walter's chicken with yuzu harissa, fried pickles, kohlrabi and grilled naan- this was GENIUS! Â Americanized peking duck style wood fired chicken. Â The chicken was so tender and moist, I wanted to die in heaven and eat more. Â I loved the combination of sauces to put on your naan and cabbage. Â The presentation was well done.. Probably one of the best chicken dishes I have ever had!++ confit goat belly with bourbon butter , lobster n' crab and fennel- yes sadly, I would have to say this was my least favorite out of them all. Â Maybe I should of stuck with my goat mousse but I thought the mix of flavors of goat belly(which is very fattening) and seafood flavors didn't go quite well together as I thought it would be. Â It was good nonetheless but just the least favorite out of them all. Â Drinks to top it off: Local 312 Beer for him and a glass of riesling for her.I really loved the logo of the restaurant with the cute little goat on the menu, the wrap around the cloth napkins, and especially the different logo wording tshirts that every server was wearing. Â So clever! "" Whatever floats your goat!"" I am so glad I was able to experience this place. I will definitely come back here again next time I am in chicago. Be prepared for me to try out the REST of your dishes, Stephanie Izard!!!"
"G.O.A.T. stands for Greatest of All Time. Â The vastly overrated LL Cool J used the acronym for one of his albums and I'm repurposing it. Not for an obviously better rapper like B.I.G. or Nas but for this West Loop eatery.OK, that first paragraph was a little clumsy, but I really wanted to work in that G.O.A.T. reference and I'm a bit spent creatively at the moment. Â Bear with me.The first time I went to Girl and The Goat was the night of the 2011 February snow storm affectionately dubbed ""Snowpacolypse"". Â Being from Upstate New York, I was a bit amused by the overreaction of the city to a snow storm tamer than some that didn't stop me from trick-r-treatin', but it was a pretty vicious snow storm nonetheless. Â This was near the beginning of the Girl and The Goat's run, when getting a reservation was rather difficult and my friends weren't going to miss it for any amount of precipitation. Â So I strapped on some snow pants and ski goggles and hit up the blue line. Â I was shocked to see the Girl and The Goat absolutely packed, though not as shocked to be the only one there wearing ski goggles. It. Did. Not. Disappoint. I've been back here many times and pretty much everything I've ever eaten here has been delicious. Â I would specifically recommend the Â Giant Pork shoulder and whatever amazing foie gras concoction they are currently serving. Â As tempting as ordering the full goat leg is if you go with a large party, I would avoid it. Â As with ordering most full animals, you handcuff the chef from being truly creative and end up with a less tasty meal with less variety."
"On a recent trip to the Windy City, I was pleasantly surprised with the great selection of first class restaurants the city had to offer. Only able to choose one, I opted for The Girl and the Goat; a James Beard Award recipient and brainchild of ""Top Chef"" star, Stephanie Izard. A rustic, yet trendy space, the Girl and the Goat is a great place for dates or groups. Equipped with a small lounge/waiting area, a bar in the center of the restaurant, and a fairly large dining room off to one side, this West Loop eatery is a ""must visit"" if ever your travel itinerary finds you in Chitown... just don't expect to get in without a reservation (or waiting AT LEAST an hour to be seated if not).Though we didn't order a dish reflective of the restaurant's moniker (goat), Â  I certainly can't forget to mention some of the crafty creations we did order... parmesean pan fried shisito peppers, diver scallops in brown butter kimchee, grilled baby octopus, pan seared halibut. Overall, a magnificent dining experience. Hats off to the chef (and pleasant wait staff)!"
"Honestly, I went here many months ago so I do not remember many details. It was really delicious. The 2 plates that I do remember as standouts: wood fire wiley point oysters and Miso-Butterscotch Budino (dessert).I do recommend this place. Â The service is very quick. Â Only complaint: you are crammed in next to your neighbors."
Yup.
...
Better the first time I went. Â REALLY rich food.
"This place really deserves 3.75 stars.I think this restaurant is good but it's mostly hype. It's almost impossible to get a reservation unless you go at 8-10pm for dinner and who wants to do that? Â All things aside the food is good, BUT after being at other places in the city first I realized it's more average. Â I actually got pretty sick from the steak tartar I had. That shouldn't happen. Â Things that I really liked were the baby octopus salad and the roasted shishito peppers. We had some sort of onion bread which had a faint shrimp flavor (totally odd), prolly not worth what is cost. The tartar had my stomach a turning but Â  the absolute worst dish I had was the goat belly with bourbon butter lobster and crab. Not a single one of those flavors worked well with each other, my friend wouldn't even eat it. Â  All in all I would not go back, and I would have murdered someone had I waited months for a reservation. G&G Â is just one of those things you do to say yeah I been there. Kinda like the G.E.B. place is supposed to be turning out..."
"Main points:- make reservations or better yet, sit at the bar if you can grab a seat- the bar area gets packed, so go at a less crowded time.- Love the selection of beer!!!- can be pricey but something to try-CONFIT GOAT BELLY had lobster n' crab --DELICIOUS. I couldn't tell the difference with the goat, but it didn't matter if it was goat meat, pork, chicken, or dog(jk)...it was gooood! I did eat this rather quickly however and was still hungry. Not a cheap dish, though.-Pass on the fried blossoms. others like it on the reviews, but it was soggy and drenched in oil.I sat at the bar by my lonely lonesome on a business trip...and luckily snagged a seat at the bar. Â This place gets packed. Â You need to make reservations or hover over people at the bar lurking to grab a seat before someone else does.I like the ambiance at the bar better than the rest of the restaurant. The hosts/hostesses are a bit pretentious. (Notice I say plural because there are literally 3 or 4 people to unnecessarily greet you when you walk in.) Yes, Â I looked a little disheveled just arriving from the airport, but hey...no need to give me these dirty looks. Already, I wasn't sure about my experience here, but I loved sitting at the bar. The bartender was so sweet, and the area was more relaxed, fun and chill."
"I have heard about this place for A LONG TIME. Lots of people telling me it is so good and that I should try it. My friend and I decided to venture out and see if we could get a table by the bar because apparently it is a month waiting list to reserve a table. Anyway, we got really lucky and as soon as we got to the place we found a table! Yay! Our expectation were obviously high and we didn't know whether we were gonna let down or what. Fortunately, we were not let down, not even close. Even though the menu was pretty adventurous, my friend and I decided to stay in the safe side and ordered the normal stuff from the menu ha.We ordered drinks: I had the Blood and Goats martini and my friend had the dirty martini with olives that had blue cheese inside. Both of them were balanced perfectly and delicious! We ordered appetizers: Fried oysters and one of the salads. Both of them DELISH!Main entrees: We had the pork shank which comes with naan bread, spicy sauce, ranch and a side of grilled veggies. Also, we ordered the goat empanadas. SO delicious!Dessert: Pineapple cake dessert that comes in a bowl (can't remember the name of it). It was orgasmic! My friend and I loved everything about this place and the waitress was really nice to us too. We will definitely return!!!! Every one that lives in Chicago should go to this restaurant and should share this with people from outta town.Yumms!"
"By far, the best restaurant I have ever been to. This place definitely deserves all the hype. I'm going to start making reservations every 2 months so I can try everything on the menu. I can't provide any recommendations because everything I had was incredible."
"I truly enjoyed my time here. Â I wasn't impressed with the goat belly but overall, most of the dish we ordered were yummy. My most favorite was the beer salad and the crudo fish. I was told the restaurant is part of James Beard award association so it may or possibly represent the name."
"This is a great place to eat! We found the waitstaff to be excellent, polite, and attentive.And the food was, well...luscious. This is a tapas-style restaurant, serving various ethnicities of food with lots of Spanish and middle-eastern influences. Â As our waitress recommended, we kept to 5 plates total, and she recommends 4 to 5 for most couples.The real winners were the Escargot Ravioli, Crisp Braised Pork Shank, and Hamachi Crudo. We would definitely visit The Girl & The Goat again, and recommend it to anyone."
"Restaurant buzz is usually overstated in my previous experiences, except for Girl & The Goat. I went to the restaurant with two friends who I would consider quite knowledgeable about food and their pairings. All of us new to Girl & the Goat. The food is an experience. I was amazed at all the different tastes that came out of our dishes. The service was impeccable, our server answered our questions and made us feel taken care of. By the end of the night we were all stuffed, happy and planning our returns. This place caters to both those more adventurous eaters and those who like the standard fare. Book your reservation now, it's worth the wait."
"Great rich food. Awesome atmosphere. I would definitely go back just wouldn't make reservations. I waited 3 months, which was to long. I would try a walk-in. It is a great experience to share with people you love."
I am a fan of Top Chef so as soon as I heard about the Girl and the Goat I had to go. Our party of four made our reservations in July for the first available Sunday night at 5:30- which was in mid-October. It was frustrating to wait so long to get in but it is SO worth it.For the four of us to share we ordered 9 main dishes (everything is a small plate) and everything we ate was wonderful. Not one bad dish (but one was mediocre).What we ordered:-Wood Grilled Broccoli-Pan Fried Shishito Peppers-Diver Scallops-Escargot Ravioli-Steamed West Coast Mussles-Wagyu Tartar-Pork Belly with fish (not sure what kind)-Goat Empanadas-Sugo Papadelle -Two types of breadI would go back and order it all again except for maybe the mussles. These mussles were the largest I have ever seen and I thought the large size took away from the meal (even though mussles are my favorite food).The Wagyu Tartar and Escargot Ravioli were the best (only slightly better than the rest).This is definitely a place I will go back to!
Best meal I've ever had in Chicago . Â The broccoli dish and potatoes raviolis were amazing. Â The flavor combinations were very unique. Â Took one star away for he scallops . Â The avocado and kimchi combo did not really wow me
"Yes, it was yummy. Service was amazing but not worth the 2 hour wait."
Disappointing meal marked by one mediocre course after another. No way does this place live up to the hype. An embarrassment to the Chicago dining scene.
"It was a great first Feb friday! Yes, it was one of those weeks where new faces, new bonds, trying new stuff was on the menu, but getting into the original Izard establishment without planning for a month in advance was certainly the highlight of that week :)It was one of those random, memorable outings - a couple of us who had met at a common event earlier that night, happened to be right across from G&G and we decided to try our luck. Thanks to a young couple that clearly had other things to do on a Friday night and vacated their dinner spot just in time, we managed to snag their great perch in the bar - total wait time 5 min!Second lucky strike - the roasted cauliflower! Anyone that can transform this rather dreary vegetable to a dish that makes you so glad you are vegetarian deserves more than the Iron Chef mantle! Pine-nuts, mint, gravy - all in harmony - darn, I wish I had used my camera phone to preserve the memory of my best roasted cauliflower experience to date! Â Another visual miss - the listing of some rather unique desserts. Ended up trying one of the ""ethnic"" ones - a tropical kulfi variation which was incredibly fresh and delicious.Last but not the least - a big shout out to the amazing girl that served us that night. Loved her recommendations ( will be back to try her dessert picks, which I vetoed :)) but more so, loved that she knew everything about everything! The backstory of the chef, the moniker(check the painting on the wall!), the experience of working there, tips to snag a table -- I could have had a conversation with her the whole time!The cynic in me was expecting Girl & the Goat to be all hype, but after my first trip there, I am certainly a fan. A diverse and interesting menu, superb quality of food, excellent service and a great ambience - the formula for a good dining experience finds a home on Randolph."
"My husband and I came here a few days ago and absolutely loved our experience. We really enjoyed going to a restaurant that had great, flavorful food, but not all the stuffiness you can get at higher scale restaurants. We ordered the pretzel bread which was to die for, a fish (can't remember the exact dish), the cauliflower (which was the best I have ever had in my life), the pork shank (def try this because the two dipping sauces it comes with are amazing) and the chocolate cake for dessert. The customer service was right on and we will definitely be going back. Although I do think it's going to be hard to figure out what we want because this is a place that you love what you order but want to try every menu item they have."
"Yep, I played it cool. I called Girl & the Goat at 4:32PM one Monday afternoon and smooth-talked my way into a table at this fine establishment..............not.Here's how the actual conversation went:*ring ring*GATG: Thank you for calling GATG can you please hold?Me: Yes...........GATG: Thank you for holding, how may I help you?Me: Hi, I'm just testing my luck today. Would you happen to have any cancellations or open tables for this evening?GATG: Uhh, no cancellations or open tables. But we do take walk-ins.Me: Okay, thank you!__________So the gf and I hopped into the car and made the drive out to the West Loop to try and get a table. With that said, we were determined and were willing to wait as long as it took [they say walk-ins can anticipate an hour+ wait]. So we get there. We walk in and are greeted by the host staff of four young ladies.Me: Hi, we don't have a reservation and were wondering if we could put our name down for a table.GATG: Sure. It looks like it's going to be an hour to an hour and a half.Me: Okay, sounds good. We'll stand over there by the revolving door.[walk away]GATG: If you see any vacancies at the bar or in the couch area, feel free to take them. Servers will take your order and bring your food to those areas if you'd like.Me: Thanks![no more than five minutes go by]GATG: Gary, we have a table for you. We kicked people out to make room for you cuz you're a baller like that. Again, we apologize for the five minute wait.Me: All greeeeeezy. Just don't let it happen again [wink]__________Some of that conversation is fabricated. Mainly the part where we stood by the revolving door.""Top to bottom. Food to service- PHENOMENAL."" That's what I wrote on the receipt at the end of our meal. You know why? Cuz it was.Our server was super helpful. He gave us what I'll say is tip number one: five dishes [plus a dessert] is enough for two people.Tip number two: order something from each part of the menu. Go veggies [we did the green beans and chickpea fritters], seafood [went with the soft shell crab], meat [go pig face or go home], goat [more belly please], and dessert [pork fat doughnuts...yeah, ya read right]. Easily the best complete meal that I've ever eaten. And I've eaten a lot of food in my short lifetime. I'd be more than happy to describe the tastes and textures of the plates, but I forgot where I put my thesaurus, as I fear I'd run out of descriptive words. But if you're genuinely interested in talking food, message me...or better yet, get your butt over to GATG.I cannot wait to go back. There is so much on the menu that sounds appetizing. Which brings me to tip number three: don't be afraid to try something out of your comfort zone. My girlfriend doesn't really eat meat, so for her to try pig face AND goat belly and like it is a testimonial in itself to how great this place is.So we got lucky with our table. Moral of the story? If you can't reserve a table on OpenTable, just head over to GATG and wait for a table. One will be available, just be patient.Ughhh I'm getting hungry just thinking about what to order next time. And yes, I've already got it all planned out. Tips four and five shouldn't really go together [drinking & driving], but we're at the end so there's nowhere else to put em. Tip four is to try the Goose Island Marisol. It's sold in only one other restaurant in the city [Frontera of Top Chef Master Rick Bayless]. Tip five: free parking a block and a half away west if you're willing to walk. Save a couple extra dollars and put em towards dessert!"
"I had mixed feelings about going here and quite honestly wasn't all that excited. In my mind, this place had at least 2 strikes against it going in. It's trendy and crowded. STRIKE ONE. It's small plates which I tend to avoid at all costs. STRIKE TWO. The third strike almost came with the noise level inside which made conversation at the table nearly impossible. Then the food started coming out and I forgot all about counting strikes, Wow. Even the bread course with interesting choices was spectacular!We ordered 8-9 plates for 4 people and with one exception, everything was superb. I didn't care for the hirami with pork belly but oh my, the rest of the plates? YES!!!! When the kohlrabi salad with fennel, blueberries, and a ginger dressing is a highlight, you know this isn't a typical night out at dinner. The soft shell crab with sweet corn relish was something out of my dreams. The wood grilled cauliflower produced flavors I didn't know were possible. The kalbi ribs with charred okra were super tasty and tender. The thought of the trout still makes my mouth water. The pig face is a popular choice - not sure if it is because of the name or because of how it tastes - but make no mistake, its so worth ordering! My favorite dish of the night was the chickpea fritters. I know! SUPRISE! I didn't know I liked chickpeas that much! But these, oh my, these sent my taste buds to a new place that they are longing to revisit. Such creamy, deep fried goodness. In the course of 2 hours, this place went from a strikeout to a grand slam when that food worked its wonders. So worth it!!"
"Best restaurant I've been to in the Chi. The food is great because they don't over complicate it. The presentation is great, but without the tons of unnecessary ingredients and strange garnishes that other fine dining restaurants think are so important. They let the ingredients shine, the way it should be.The scallops were the standout dish - huge, perfectly spiced, and cooked to absolute perfection. The sweet potato hash was a great accompaniment and they give you plenty of it. The goat empanadas were not overly fried and the goat was moist and simply delicious - a great first dish for cocktails. They should jar whatever fish sauce concoction they put on the green beans, stuff was cray. The Duck Confit was seasoned well, fork tender, and was a nice honkin' portion - no dainty plates at Girl & The Goat. Roasted pig face served like breakfast with a big fried egg on top, yup. You order by picking a bunch of dishes and then your server determines a serving order based off of what you picked. We asked our server to pick most of our dishes and she hit the nail on the head Â - everything was spectacular.*They had some sort of off-menu sponge cake with watermelon sorbet for dessert. It was in all seriousness the best desert I can remember eating in my lifetime. If they have it when you're there GET IT!The cocktails were awesome as well. Â The 6th Borough and Best of Three were the standouts, though they were all good (we sampled more than a few ;).As far as atmosphere: great modern vibe, wasn't overcrowded, music was the best I've heard at Â restaurant. 90's hip hop!? Word!? A couple got engaged while we were there. Classy. Â Servers and host we're friendly and even shoo'd away some people at the bar that were overcrowding the space when we were getting drinks. Excellent people control. Girl & the Goat is just all-around awesome."
"This restaurant has been my favorite in Chicago for years now, so my amazing meal there last night was no surprise. However, Mr. Sherman was a wonderful surprise and addition to the night! After a small snafu with the tables, he was attentive and overly helpful to me and my mom. He was a gem. Don't let him move to St. Louis!"
"4.5 stars.Got a fluke reservation for 4:30 on a Friday by checking OpenTable the day of.Dishes, in order of enjoyment:1. Pig face2a.Dessert: Budino with bacon toffee, candied pineapple and cashews. YUM.2b. Meyer lemon butter with the bread starter3. Goat heart. But needs more goat sausage in it.4. Wood-roasted oysters.5. Chickpea fritters. 1-4 were amazing. Flavors in the chickpea fritters just didn't vibe with me.Extensive, affordable beer list.Only gripe:Patrons on either side of us were the annoying kind of 'foodie.' They weren't there for the food; they were there to tell their friends they'd been there. Respect the food, not the scene, people."
"WOW! Unfortunately I've procrastinated in writing this review and have forgotten the names of individuals and dishes; however, this establishment sticks out like a sore thumb when asked for best restaurant experiences. First: ambiance, lighting, music: PERFECT!Second: service: this is how you do it! We walked in and were greeted immediately by a very pleasant smile and welcoming tone from two ladies that were clearly happy to be there and showed up well put together, ready to invite the guests. BAM!We were seated promptly, water glasses filled quickly and introduced to the menu with clear direction and enthusiastic suggestions. WERQ!Orders taken and executed perfectly with server and chef; manager comes by and we talk with him for a bit and we are left just thinking 'WOW', these people love their product, love their work place, and love Chef Stephanie Izard!Food was MIND BLOWING! Â We had several dishes and everything was full of flavor that makes you melt in your seat, roll back your eyes, and curl your toes!Thank you, Girl & The Goat! I recommend you daily from a hotel front desk :)Side note: Â Little Goat brunch is fucking FANTASTIC!"
"I've seen this word mentioned in a few other reviews and I'll repeat....hype. Perfectly lovely space, good food. but a bit too pretentious and precious.A -- I don't care that the chef is a ""celebrity"" chef from some TV reality show. I go to a restaurant for good food, not to catch a glimpse of some celeb.So, it's a Tuesday afternoon, and we call the restaurant to see what a reasonable time is for us to come in and hope for a table, or two seats at the bar. we're informed that if we make it in ""by 430"" we could get a table...uh....we have jobs....so, we get there right before 515, pay the valet and head in. we spy two seats at the bar, and oh, we should have grabbed them. instead the host tells us he can grace us with a table but we MUST be out by 645. Â figuring that we should easily be able to eat in 1 1/2 hours, we agree.takes a while for waitress to come by, but once she does, we order a cocktail and our dishes -- culture club bread, the chickpea app, the beet salad, the diver scallops and the pan roasted trout. chickpea shows up about 15 minutes later. outstanding. bus boy takes it away when finished. wait for bread and beet salad. salad shows up via some very rushed bus boy. our waitress hasn't stopped by since we placed our order. trout show up....excellent, but we're closing in on an hour plus. at 615 waitress stops by....hey, where's our bread? oh? you never got it? Â i'll rush it through. bread comes out at 625. we enjoy it with the scallops that just came out. still working on our bread (and the butters are on the cutting board) when silent, scurrying bus boy swoops in and takes the board wtih the butters before we have a chance to say anything.630 -- the elusive waitress stops by. the host station has reminded her that we need to be out by 645. we express that we're eating as fast as as can, but they haven't held up their part of the bargain by getting the food out in a timely manner...or at all. do we want dessert? Â well, yes, we'd love some. well, they could serve us dessert up front on the couches where all the poor saps who are going to wait for a table are at. Â my dining companion says"" if our choice is dessert in the waiting area or no dessert, we're not having dessert."" our bill is immediately give to us and we abandon our table so the next diners...the important ones with reservations, can have the table.food was good, but not into spending $100+ for 4 sharable dishes and bread and two cocktails and being rushed through my meal by no fault of our own. i dont care if the mastermind is a Top Chef or not...."
"What can be said about Girl & the Goat that hasn't been said already? Nothing! I'll spare you the 600-word amateur food critic review, and sum it up in two words: It's fabulous! So, if you're wondering if you should try this restaurant, the answer is yes. Stop being a dumb-dumb, pick up your phone and make reservations now! One last thing: Order the cauliflower. Who knew this oft-bland vegetable could taste so heavenly!"
"Walked in at 4:45 on a Friday, tables were 1/3 full, told hostess we would be in and out for a table for 2 in 45 minutes. She proceeded to tell us rudely there was an hour wait. (There was no one else I could see waiting) so my friend and I went to the bar to get a drink and perhaps a bite and lucky for us we came upon Joshua, the most unfriendly bartender I've ever had take my order. Â He acted like we were bothering him and continued to roll his eyes at our drink and food orders. I was beginning to think I had been punked. Â (No one could possibly be that rude to paying costumers, two times over). Â As we stood at the bar with our food and drinks, we stared at 7 empty two tops for 90 minutes. Â I will never return to this high end Ed Debevics again. Â Thanks for a great Midwestern night !!"
"I loved everything about this place. Â The food was outstanding, and the drink was one of the best I've ever had. Â I recommend going in with an open mind and trying all types of different things. Â It's a great place to share small plates with someone and have some of the best food in the city. Â I found a reservation on open table for the same day, and didn't have to wait 4 months like a lot of people do. Â I would recommend trying to sit in the bar area of you want to go at the last minute. Â There were open seats at 8:30pm when we were there. Â I will definitely be back."
"This please exceed my expectations! Food was excellent. My boyfriend and I tried to eat as much as possible to try it all. We had the grilled baby octopus, wagyu beef tartar, Arctic char and the not your Campbell's soup bread. My mouth was singing. Reasonably priced and worth the hype. Even the bathrooms were superb! Good job Stephanie!"
"Good food, definitely a very ecletic menu- think goat carpaccio or goat empanadas. We went we a group and had a boatload of food. I think the highlights were the pretzel bread and the pigface (must have!). The goat empanadas and the scallops were also tasty. Everything is heavy and rich though, so don't go if you're on a diet."
"One of the best meals I've had in my life. Absolutely worth whatever it takes to get you in there with a menu in hand. I got there on a weekend right after they opened for the day, and was seated at the bar immediately. Incredible food, drink pairings, ambiance, and service."
Went on a recommendation from a friend who lives in Chicago. This place did not disappoint at all. Service was excellent and everything we had was great. We tried something from all parts of the menu. The roasted cauliflower and salmon dishes were the standouts but the pig face was definitely something to try. Would definitely recommend this place and we will be back on our next trip to Chicago.
"I've been here twice and I plan to go back a whole lot more.The first time was with a party of 8. I wouldn't really recommend doing this unless you order enough portions for everyone. Most items (even some from their goat menu) are best shared by two people.I like how the menu is split up into Veggies, Fish, Meat and each section has a broad selection of flavors. You could make whole dinners off just one section!The 2nd time that I went was a party of 2. We ordered 5 different dishes (including the goat belly which was absolutely delicious). That left us quite satisfied. Surprisingly, I wasn't really a big fan of the dessert selections but that wasn't a problem because it just left me more room for the other amazing items on the menu."
"Made reservations two months in advance because it was a special night, was really excited to eat at G&G.Walked in and hostess asked us to wait then wished my wife a happy birthday...Nice gesture but a little awkward because it immediately got my wife thinking...what's going to happen next?Waited for our table for a while despite the reservations. Drinks were fine and pricey, people were fine, decor is fine...We got our table and were happy to order, but could have used more help. No one talked to us about the servings and they should have. G&G should be called a tapas restaurant cause the servings are small even tiny. Like 4 small ravioli in a plate small. All of our dishes were like that. Not a big deal really, but how can you not mention this to customers?We wanted each dish to be awesome but they...weren't. We ordered fries at the end because we were still hungry and they might have been the best, that or the bread when it first arrives hot on your table, Dessert was sloppy sugar and brownie, we just shoveled it down cause at that point we didn't really care, just talking about everything but the restaurant. Anyway for food I think there is room for improvement in my humble opinion. We asked for the food in a certain order and it came the complete opposite meaning my wife was finished before I got any food. I called ahead to have a candle placed on her dessert for her birthday. The hostess wasn't great over the phone which is one thing, then they didn't do anything which was the real crappy part. Once we were finished the waiter brought the check to me, looked right at my wife and said ""birthday dessert is on the house""...like she needed to know?? Â Surprised he didn't mention the $150 bill that we somehow ended up with...Awkward.Overall I stinks to say I was disappointed but we were. We talked a lot about going to other restaurants in the area, way more than going back to G&G. Doubt we'd go back anytime soon."
"Great big room with joyously eating guests, and, as far as the food goes, every dish was really different and delicious. I would try and go back with a group 4-5 people to taste more items on the menu. Although, some dishes were very small. Just go in knowing it took 5-6 dishes between two until we felt full. The beef shank was absolutely amazing."
"Yup, that was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. Really nice balance of flavors and textures, every bite introduced a new part of each dish.The pig face lives up to its hype even though ingredient-wise, it sounds like a glorified corned beef hash, but oh man, this'll be some of the most delicious corned beef hash you've ever put in your mouth. Like scrape the plate, lick the spoon delicious. Which is exactly what I did.The only dish I wasn't a huge fan of was the pan fried duck tongue. Â I didn't think the flavors came together that well, and there wasn't enough acid in the dish for me to cut that deep fried fatty goodness (let's not be shy about pickling those watermelon rinds!)If you don't like beets like me, get the roasted beets, they'll change your mind.Oh and skip the desserts, and have some more pork and/or goat instead."
"Finally able to try this restaurant! Â But by going with a large group (apparently easier to get a reservation sooner that way). Â And since we were a large group, they offered us the goat special. Â A 9 lb leg I believe. Â It was my first time trying goat and I must say it was delish! Â Glad there were leftovers. Â I even liked it more than their other specialty pig face. Â That is saying a lot from a pork lover like me. Â I wish they put more bacon toffee in their budino than they did though. Â Anyways, I would love to return to Girl and The Goat when the opportunity comes up again. Â A suggestion to large parties: Â try the goat. Â I believe they only offer it to large parties and you have to reserve that in advance as well. Â Also, they do not automatically add gratuity to large parties like other restaurants do. Â The service was great so please keep that in mind if you go."
"I like when my palette is challenged. Do I like lamb heart or beef tongue? I don't know....do I? I now know I do.Absolutely loved everything about this place. Had to book 3 months in advance and still ended up with an 11:30pm reservation. Wait staff was extremely apologetic of that, which surprised me because it was in no way their fault. Waitress had tons of suggestions and was very natural talking to her. Personally the goat empanadas were my favorite. House wine was very good and complimented everything nicely. I love the charred wood interior, and also the crazy psychedelic goat pictures on the wall.Make a reservation now, and go here in 3 months. You'll be bragging about it for a while."
"Delicious! Such great food, great staff and fantastic drinks!Just a tip: Â I called the day of and got reservations for that night. Â So while I've tried getting them before and was told I had to wait a month, there is a chance you can score seating the same night you call. Â In a nutshell, this place is hip, great for groups, has great service and the food is amazing.We had: Â Chickpea Fritters, Pork Shank, Scallops and the Mussels. Â We actually ordered 2 additional plates (not knowing how full we would be) that we had to get boxed right away so we could take home. Â I haven't tried them yet but I plan on having them for dinner tonight. Everything was FANTASTIC. Â The chickpea fritters were a great way to start. Â Our favorite, by far, was the pork shank. Â GET IT! Â The meat falls off the bone and then you get this delicious smoked noodle-like side and some pita on the side as well. It also comes with 2 sauces and everything just came together so amazingly. Â The mussels were fantastic though, to be honest, you can have fairly good mussels other places so I'm not sure I would re-order those. Â There are just so many interesting sounding plates on the menu that I would rather try. The scallops were delicious too!All in all we had a fantastic time. I can't think of a single thing this restaurant could have done better. Â Its a bit pricey but worth every pennt."
"The emperor has no clothes. We know this will be a controversial review but we were bowled over (not in a good way) by the excessive use of salt, sugar and sauce in each of the 8 dishes we tried. Everything - including Â broccoli, shrimp, pig face, oysters, skirt steak, Arctic char,- Â would have been better had it been far less adorned. Â Good food should stand on its own, not hide behind a pool of salty, sugary sauce. Â We were extremely disappointed."
"I went here for my birthday dinner and I am pleased to say that it definitely lives up to the hype. It was a culinary adventure and our server Patrick was a great tour guide. It is small plates (for the most part) so you are expected to order at least 2 plates per person. I loved that because I got to try a lot more things. There are so so many great things on the menu so this is a great idea. We went in with the plan that we would all order something in our comfort zone, and something that was new and/or intimidated us a little. It was a very fun approach and really happy that we did that because some of our favorites ended up being things we might not order if we only ordered one thing. My favorite was the pork shank. It was incredibly flavorful, and the moist on the inside with the skin perfectly crispy. It was served with a naan type of bread and two sauces. It came with two sauces/dressings and I honestly never tried them because it was so delectable by itself! The surprises for us was the beef tongue (so so good!), kona kampachi crudo (the pork belly was the perfect topping!) and the fried naked cowboy oysters. I couldn't stop smiling on behalf of my taste buds!So why didn't I give this a 5? Well, 4 starts is ""Yay! I'm a fan"" and I am. We had some challenges getting the attention of the server in the lounge, even though we were sitting at a lounge table, and we had an ""odd"" encounter with one of the bussers so my first interaction with a staff person was not the greatest. .I'm not making a mountain out of a mole hill by any means and everyone has an off day. I will happily go back again because the food and dinner service was outstanding. Thank you for making my birthday so memorable."
"Waited 3 some odd months to go here and the food was good and different. Â I was totally in favor of the idea of coming here after my wife explained there would be meat in practically everything. Â I liked the food but the table after a 3 month wait was a bit small and smushed next to the bar. Â Had they been hungry, they could have grabbed something off our plates. Â They wouldn't have gotten the food up to their mouth; the knees might be gone but the hand/eye coordination is still there but you get the picture.I liked the pigs in a blanket and the scallops. Â We also shared a Hanger steak that I wish had been only mine. Â Dessert could have been better.We've done it, we've girled, we've goated, we won't be back until the in crowd has moved on and we can have a better and roomier table situation."
"Went their last Sunday night. I could not have been happier with the beer selection, service or the food. I'm not a big ""small plates"" kind of guy. But they are large enough and the service allows you to enjoy each meal individually. We ordered more than the server recommended, but we were hungry, OK? We ate everything. It's expensive, but a great experience and one I will repeat in the future.The cheesecake dessert was awesome."
"My daughter made the reservation 2 months ago and boy were we looking forward to this. We liked the ambience - it wasn't too crowded at 5:00 pm on a Wednesday evening, although the place was really hopping by the time we left. The service was excellent and we didn't feel that the noise level was excessive.The green beans were very delicious and rich, and I remarked about the generous portion - not really a small plate at all. Upon tasting the goat belly, we both felt like we were in heaven - unbelievably exquisite taste - far surpassing the ground goat burgers we have both enjoyed. So the first two dishes were big hits, at least while we were dining. Next came the cauliflower which was a downer for two reasons - one being that it was extremely salty - beware if you have hypertension! Second, it was laden with tons of parmesan cheese and butter - the menu doesn't mention the cheese and my daughter has a dairy allergy. The waiter graciously took this back and removed it from the tab and the manager came to our table and apologized. And last, but not least, the dish we were eagerly awaiting - the pig face. Very unique taste and highly creative presentation - but not a dish I would order again. My daughter enjoyed the interesting flavor of the round pork patties more than I did.The bottom line is that Girl & the Goat belly caused this old goat's sensitive tummy a lot of distress ... still suffering 24 hours later. Both of us had pretty bad digestive cramps and heartburn. I think the cuisine, while incredibly creative, is also very rich, and decidedly too much for my delicate stomach. Oh well, I am still glad we tried this place. It is a true gastronomic paradise if you have a strong gut."
"I came here with some friends for a special birthday dinner (thanks Neena P!). What better way to celebrate your twenty-somethingth birthday than with good food and good friends?The restaurant itself has a rustic chic feel to it. Dark colors, industrial finishes, but with touches of worn wood and warm lighting. The menu is set up to share and our server did a phenomenal job going over the selection and providing recommendations. We had a food allergy in our group, and someone came over from the kitchen with a special menu with handwritten notes indicating all the dishes that contained the forbidden ingredient. The service was just top notch. To eat, we ordered 8 dishes for 4 girls. Overall, the veggie dishes had larger quantities of food than the meat dishes, except for the pork shank which was delightfully huge. Veggie dishes - chickpea fritters, roasted cauliflower, green beans. The fritters were really the standout here, but the other two dishes held their own. However, I would be disappointed as a vegetarian if I ate here. The dishes really don't act as standalone entrees and function more as embellished side dishes. Seafood - scallops and the trout. I was most interested in the crispy lentils that accompanied the fish. They were delicious! The scallops were well cooked, but nothing innovative to me. Meat - ham frites, goat belly, pork shank. Ham frites were a disappointment. French fries sprinkled with ham dust. Meh. The goat belly was a new experience for me, and it was melt-in-your mouth delicious, with a hint of sweetness I have never tasted in meat before. The pork shank was large and in charge, and came with a tasy kimchi dipping sauce that lent a punch of flavor to the tender meat. Dessert - sticky cake, chocolate caramel cake, and something else that obviously wasn't very memorable. The sticky cake had blueberries on it and I could have eaten 5 of these. The cake was interesting and was served with shiitake mushroom ice cream and shiitake caramel reduction. It was very earthy and slightly off putting at first, but I really enjoyed it after feeling it out. They actually gave me this for my birthday as a surprise with a candle, so I'm happy I got to try something I would never have ordered myself. All in all, the experience was 5 stars and the food would get 4.5. The majority was delicious, but there were a few misses as well. We spend about $55 per person and left with full bellies."
"Is it necessary to give another good review of the Girl and the Goat? Â Probably not, but I'll do it anyway. Â  Just know you're going to eat some rich food and want to take a food coma afterwards.We ordered a bunch of stuff to share, so I'll just list the highlights. Â Breads - we got three different kinds which each came with different spreads and were greatGoat Carpaccio - Had to get some goat. Â Was deliciousGrilled Octupus - Not too chewy, great seasoningDiver Scallops - some would argue the best thing on the menu. Â Definitely get themEscargot ravioli - I love escargot and if you do, you should order thisGoat liver mousse - I love liver spreads. Â Not everyone was in love with it as me, but I would definitely order it againPumpkin pie gelato - I'm sure this isn't around too long, but the waiter recommended it and it was the best dessert we had for sure.If you're actually going, you probably made a reservation a long time ago and don't need to be talked into going here. Â Just make plans a couple months in advance and enjoy."
"One of my favorite locations in Chicago to eat at. Try to go with a large party of 12 or more so you can order the Goat Leg and share. I really want to try this but have been unable to get a large party to go. Great atmosphere, mostly good service and the restrooms are awesome. They are downstairs... make sure you go while you're there. What I ate: Roasted Cauliflower - Exactly what it sounds like. I think i had a peice that had too much acid on it. But overall it was pleasing. Roasted Beats - Love Roasted Beets! Chickpea Fritters - I thought these were okay. A little denser and mushier than I thought they would be. Diver Scallops - Seared to perfection. Great Great Great. Ham Frites - Dissapointed. Literally french fires with ham dust.... I was expecting much more. They are really salty too. Sugo - I actually enjoyed this dish but a few people in my party thought it tasted like Chef Boyardee and I coudln't get that out of my mind after they said that. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - REALLY GOOD... it was a little sweet for me. Some of the reduction was either too sweet or over reduced but next time I get it, I will not eat it with the sweet sauce. Braised Pork Shank - Awesome.... Favorite thing of the night. So tender, so well seasoned and the kim chee sauce it comes with... to die for. Almost everything was amazing. It's cheaper than most places you find in LA that serves tapas style dishes and I really enjoyed the ambiance. GO!"
"I mean, good vibe and ok food but I've had better on both counts. Though I must admit we ate there when it was only a week old so maybe its gotten better."
"Quick review - one of the best meals I've had.No reservations available on an early weekday night. Called and was told wait should be 1 - 1.5 hours. Came over and was fortunate to get one seat at the bar to share (seat adjacent opened up shortly after).Eased in with good cocktails and started ordering pairs of dishes that we thought would compliment. Goat carpaccio and sockeye salmon tartare kicked the meal off with a bang. The salmon was close your eyes good. Later dishes that were also great were the hiramasa crudo and grilled pork ribs. The only dish that wasn't outstanding was the roasted beets, and it was still good, just not memorable. It's a hearty portion, though, so it might be a good one to order for a large group.We actually had the option to be seated shortly before our first plates arrived (not a long wait at all) but we were quite comfortable at the bar with the stellar open kitchen next to us and enjoyed chatting with the bartenders about the drinks and local beers."
"I've never been to a classy tapas restaurant like this before. Let's start with the downside. If you don't have a reservation, you'll be looking forward to a long wait unless you get really lucky. A reservation for four people at a 6:30pm dinner took us three months in advanced. It's a little loud, but for some of you who are looking for a quiet dinner or personal space, this place is not for you. There's a small couch area to the left as soon as you walk in, available if no seats are taken, =P , for drinks. There's a long bar for singles and cougars, lots of cougars and couples.. Ooooh my! It looks like you can sit and drink or eat and enjoy the scenery. You can people watch and create conversations for people or enjoy watching douche bags with their classy wannabe girlfriends. Or try to be like ""normal"" people and come here with awesome friends and/or family. There is space between seating areas.. Yeah! As soon as we walked in, the host/hostess were prompt and greeted us with a smile eagerly waiting to help us. Although we were 30 mins early, they sat us 5 minutes late. No biggie. Our waiter, Gary, was awesome!! He was talkative and very informative about the menu. He was able to recommend really great dishes, and was definitely patient with us. He gave us ample amount of time to look over the drinks and food menu, but fast enough to come back and take our orders. He would leave our area, but he was readily available to everyone in his area. Great job!! The food.. As Grayson from Top Chef would say, it's like sex in the mouth. We shared 8 plates and 3 desserts. Our top choices were: chicken little bread (all i have to say is ""Da Butter""), himachi crudo, wood oven tossed pig face, sauteed green beans, and sugo... I personally am not a big fan of oysters, but let me tell you, they are great! I've been convinced otherwise how good they are because of G&G. And the dessert... Ohmahgawd!! They have an extensive amount of beer/wine selections, and a separate special menu just for bread, goat, and oysters which is only for a limited time and dependent on seasons. To make life easier for yall, you can read the menu LoL. You know, I'm not huge or small, but I'm a tall guy with an appetite. I didn't think all of these small plates would fill me up, but the richness in flavors and the amount of calories in each plate did the job for me. The bathrooms are downstairs, 8 in total, all unisex and separate. If you wanted to have a two people party, if you know what i mean.. I'm just saying, you could probably pull it off. Everyone was attentive. One of the best experiences I've ever had. I recommend it to anyone with an open mind. Hope you enjoy this experience like we did."
"Pretty awesome, I have to say. I went with a friend of mine and her parents and it was great. We had the BEST bottle of red wine, and I wish I could remember the name!The dishes we got were completely random (we all selected different ones to share) and they were pretty great, some better than others. I will say one of my favorite aspects about this place was the atmosphere. It was cozy and comfy on a cold winter night and it hit the spot!Now, is it as amazing as everyone says? Eh. I'm not totally positive, but it's still definitely really good!"
"Meh. Overpriced, noisy. Personally this restaurant is just all hype. Veggie options are good but otherwise the meat and fish options come in TINY portions but large price tags. The scallops were good but 2 for $17 makes it hard to share and the goat belly was not good at all. The cauliflower was yummy though. Green beans were too salty. Also felt like the menu was not cohesive at all, everything was so random and it didn't fit together too well when you had a couple of dishes at the same time.OVERALL SAVE YOUR MONEY AND PASS ON THIS RESTAURANT"
"Straight to the point:Bread - forgot the name but the two spreads were delicious. The bread had a crispy crust but extremely soft and warm interior. I bet other breads are equally great.Veggie - roasted cauliflower. Can't say I'm a fan. Appreciated the pine nuts and the kick of pickled peppers but honestly cauliflower is still cauliflower. Still better than broccoli would have been.Seafood - scallops. OMG OMG OMG. You have to get this. Tender, sweet, fresh and juicy, and perfectly seared scallops, partnered with the contrasting textures and flavors of pine nuts, pomegranate, and fried brussels sprouts. Everything was perfect. The reduced pumpkin sauce was the right amount of richness and fragrance. Meat - Pig face - a must-have I suppose. Meat almost melted in my mouth. Creamy sauce and potato sticks made it more interesting. Egg could have been runnier. I'm Chinese though, so I was disappointed when I did not see a whole pig face. Duck leg - after the pig face, this dish was just like a deja vu. You can definitely tell the ingredients are fresh and top-notch, but the treatment is pretty similar - they seared the dug leg, slow cooked it perfectly so it was tender and juicy (coz the searing locked the juice in) but the sauce was strikingly similar to the pig face sauce. The bok choy was thrown in there for a reason that I cannot quite fathom... Desserts - butter peanut custard. Guilty pleasure to the extreme. Oatmeal-peanut crumbles paired with honey yogurt custard. This is warm BTW. Add on the cold apple sorbet/Italian ice, it was just like three desserts in one bowl.Bottom line:1. Start looking for a reservation now for a dinner in about two months - unless you don't mind eating at 4:30 or 9:30 on a weekday or 9:30 on a Sunday.2. Very very good ingredients. I think if you try their goat dishes, you will appreciate this even more. But with other meat dishes, I personally would enjoy more varieties of flavors than creamy butter.3. Their menus change very frequently, which sucks, for my wallet.4. Lovely ambiance and better than Avec but still very intimate seating. So don't make the mistake that we did - comment on how the couple next table ordered a $80 wine while we were contemplating going to Binny's afterwards."
I came in on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. If you're looking for a sit-down make a reservation! We sat at the bar - which I personally think is the best spot in the house - and the bartenders helped us make great selections. Get the miso bread if it's on the menu. The fried pickles are good but the roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers are better. Definitely a place to try if you're in the West Loop!
"This Chicago hotspot is the brainchild of Top Chef season 4 winner Stephanie Izard. We took our chances and arrived for dinner at 5pm without a reservation. We got lucky, because after a 5 or 10 minute wait we were seated. This is a small plates menu, and is quite appealing for the more adventurous of us, but we spent a lot of our meal laughing at the reactions of a young couple beside us that were clearly way out of their comfort zone with the dishes they ordered. There was a lot of face pulling, nervous sniffing of dishes, and tentative tasting. They were clearly more of an Applebee's type of couple. Hilarious. -Side note- In a city the size of Chicago it was amazing to see this same couple again miles away at the starbucks next to Second City an hour later... eating! Obviously pig face was not to their liking. Speaking of pig face... this is the dish that most intrigued us, so kudos to whoever named this dish. Wood oven roasted pig face, sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, and potato stix. Like the food itself, it was memorable. We still joke to this day about eating ""face"". It was crispy and decadent, and inspired a number of inappropriate moans of delight from our table. I would go back if only to have this one dish again. Spectacular. We also ordered the pan fried shishito peppers, parmesan, sesame and miso. Oh my, this was up there for me as a favourite too. Unique and really satisfying. It's another I would order again. Anyone for goat chorizo flatbread, ajvar, peppers, green tomato, apricot, and fresh ricotta? I said yes, and I recommend you do too. We had so much more that was worthy of mention such as the edamame in sweet soy sauce, and the parsnip pot du creme for dessert, but really you should just go try everything for yourself and don't take my word for it! You won't be sorry."
"Showed up as a group of four at 5:00pm on a Friday night without reservations and offered to be seated immediately but with the caveat that we had to be out by 6:15pm. Â Even though we finished with time to spare, the experience felt a little rushed (though I would chalk that up to caveat emptor). Â I do wonder, though, if the timing also affected the way we were served, with small tapas-sized dishes antiseptically brought out one after another rather than in the usual groups of at least two or three. Â In any event, we started with the...Corny Goat Bread--bread with goat cheese butter and corn relish. Â Definitely pass on this. Â The second greatest trick the devil ever played was convincing the world to pay for something it should be getting for free.Roasted Edamame. Â One of the better dishes of the evening. Â Was fun eating the edamame covered in spices and smokey blue cheese. Â I wish the pods could have been larger, but I suppose that's an effect of the roasting preparation.Roasted Beets Salad with green beans, white anchovy, and avocado creme fraiche. Â A decent salad but logistically tough to share. Â I would not recommend it to be shared between more than two people.Squash Blossom Rangoon with crab, chive yogurt, and toasted almonds. Â This was also one of the better dishes I had--a delicate presentation combined with the familiar crab rangoon taste.Seared Tuna with lamb sausage, grilled blueberry, and pepitas. Â The tuna was okay, but there is absolutely no coherency with this dish. Â Tried the elements together. Â Tried them separately. Â No added value came through either way.Grilled Baby Octopus with guanciale, wax beans, radish, favas, and pistachio-lemon vinaigrette. Â The octopus and beans were good, but the vinaigrette was a little overpowering.Confit Goat Belly with bourbon butter, lobster, crab, and fennel. Â Another difficult item to share with more than two people. Â Did not really stand out at all taste-wise.Goat Empanadas. Â One order comes with 2 empanadas. Â This was finally a dish where the robust flavor of the goat meat came through. Â Not amazing, but one to definitely try if you're there.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. Â Comical. Â Roasted to a crisp then combined with potato stix for meaningless filler and cilantro to try to inject some taste. Â Roasted pig face can stand on its own without this tinkering. Â Maybe she felt this was an obligatory menu item given how popular pork dishes are now, but Izard is clearly out of her comfort zone on this.Pork fat doughnuts with honey yogurt, carmelized figs, lemony eggplant, and ham streusel. Â Pretty disappointing taste-wise for something with so many elements to it. Â Sometimes, less is more.Often overlooked in my reviews, I have to say I really enjoyed my drink, called a Best of Three. Â It starts off with a very strong cucumber taste and then follows up with mint flavors--this was the best single item I had at Girl & the Goat. Â The other non-food elements of the restaurant were also very strong: Â Service was attentive and quick (maybe a side bonus of being on a 1.25 hour clock). Â The layout of the restaurant was quite nice--didn't feel at all crowded as is the case at many top small plates places.Overall, I would put Girl & the Goat somewhere between two and three stars. Â The double-edged sword of hype surrounding this restaurant gives rose-colored glasses to some and high expectations to others. Â If it were not already evident, I am in the latter camp. Â The Squash Blossom, Edamame, and even Goat Empanadas were highlights, but these dishes were among several others that did not stand out at all and even some that were blatant misses like the Seared Tuna and Pig Face. Â I am up to give Girl & the Goat another try some time but unless the hype machine dies down and reservations become more reasonable, I think G&G and I are going to be going our separate ways."
"Wow. Â That sums it up. Â Great service. Â I love meat, but must say the veggie dishes are awesome."
"SUPER delicious - and not as expensive as I expected it to be! Â Very reasonable for the quality you're getting.Favorite dishes: beet salad, pig face, dish that had goat belly in it, the chocolate dessert. Â SOOOO effing good. Â Other dishes were good, but didn't change my life (a different salad, the octopus).Great server - cute menus, not overwheming for being ""foodie"", well organized. Â A little loud/close quarter seating, but you don't even notice after the first 5 minutes. Â TOTALLY recommend... just wish you luck in getting a reservation!"
"This place is AMAZING. I had to wait 3 months for my reservation. It was worth it! The scallops with black beans tasted great. Had their goat meat. The combination of food for some dishes may sound weird, but they are all amazing. Feel free to try something that sounds bizarre. Our waiter was very friendly. They have separate bathroom stalls for men and women, so there was more privacy. Will ABSOLUTELY come back again. This is a great place to take your date to. Could absolutely amaze him/her."
"Thanks to AMEX Platinum, my in-laws and I were able to score a Saturday night reservation at Girl & The Goat--they take reservations very far in advance and despite calling 6 weeks ahead, we were initially pretty bummed to find we couldn't get a table for my father-in-law's surprise 55th birthday weekend. Â Kamil at AMEX Platinum was able to arrange a 9:30 table, and we're so glad he did.First, I have to say that the service was absolutely phenomenal. Â We were seated right away and Bennan took care of us for the night. Â We were very excited to dine there and he was equally enthusiastic about the food. Â Its always great to have wait staff who are really knowledgeable about the menu and offer recommendations with genuine passion--he's a huge part of why we had such a great night. Â All his recommendations were spot on, most notably his own cocktail which was not on the menu, the ""Bitter Pinguin"", a bourbon negroni using Breckenridge bitters instead of Campari. Â The BBs were aromatic and a really unique smooth addition. Â He brought the bottle over and gave a neat short pour just to enjoy the bitters alone, and it will soon be an addition to my liquor cabinet! Â I can't recommend this highly enough! Â My wife and I enjoy eating out at swank places, but getting the hot rezzy also sometimes means there's pressure to hurry up, eat, and get out. Â We ordered 12 dishes and 2 desserts for 5 people. Â The food is meant to be shared, and came out at a great pace. Â We never had more than 2 dishes at a time, which gave us a chance to enjoy each dish and most of all, enjoy each other.On to the food (dish by dish)Zucchini bread: soft, delicious, flavorfulCorny Goat BreadFried pickles with Yuzu Harisa and Shallot AioliGreen Beans: Best green beans I've ever had, a must orderRoasted Cauliflower: Also a great dishSweet Corn Goat Cheese Wontons: Diver Scallops: perfectly cookedEscargot ravioliBaby Octopus salad: Both my wife and my favorite dish of the night!Orange Blossom Crab RangoonTuna with Watermelon salad: this was to only miss of the night. Â It wasn't bad by any stretch, but just paled in comparison to the other offeringsDuck tongue: Pig face: I have never eaten pig face before. Â Brenan said it was the best item on the menu and I figured I wouldn't eat pig face otherwise, plus I could make ""Ruthy Pigface Draper"" jokes for the balance of the night, so we did it and so glad we did--great texture, great flavor.Peach Buckle (with a candle for the birthday boy!)Miso Butterscotch Budino: Terrific ending to the meal, such unique flavors that all melded so well!"
"My hubby was able to get us a table for our anniversary and I was so excited! Â We had a wonderful server who explained the meals were meant to be shared. Â So here's the breakdown:Roasted cauliflower with mint and pine nuts: good, not great. I do appreciate the combination of flavors and texture. Sauteed shrimp with spaghetti squash and pork ragout: Solid. Wood fire chicken served with naan: pretty amazing! Â SautÃ©ed green beans: my absolute favorite dish. Loved the combination of flavors with the cashews. Grilled octopus: was a bummer. Had too much of the burnt flavor in it.Scallops: also amazing. Nicely seared on a sweet cream sauce served with pomegranate seeds and walnuts! Yum! All this food for just two people, we were stuffed and didn't have room for dessert. Â I would definitely recommend this place. Can't wait to try the other items on the menu, and the menu changes seasonally."
"My boyfriend took me to Girl & The Goat last night (Tuesday) for my birthday dinner. We had just made reservations on Sunday so of course we took one of the only time slots we could get: 9:45. We even ended up getting there a little early, around 9:20, and they were able to seat us immediately, which was awesome considering the place was packed.I didn't see the what total bill ended up being after tax and tip, but I can estimate the cost of our food and drink alone was about $100. That was with four main dishes, two cocktails and a dessert plate, all of which made us feel satisfied and not overly full.Quinoa Ravioli: Simple but a delicious sauce. Also, the vegetables that came on top of it (squash, zucchini, grape tomatoes and wine grapes) added to the whole thing. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: Once again, the sauce is delicious--it's sweet and rich. And the meat of course was moist and fell apart. You really don't need a knife for this or any of the other meat dishes since they're so tender.Confit Goat Belly: I thought this was good, once again it had a lot to do with the sauce. I know some other reviews said it was too rich, but from my experience, it's such a small portion that when shared between two people (like we did with all of our plates), it's not overwhelming in the slightest. Braised Beef Tongue: It's good but not as on par with the other dishes we had. The tongue itself was good, but the rest of the toppings on this dish were a little more ""meh."" A decent dish but not extremely special in any way.And for dessert, the Chocolate Magic Shell: The sorbets and watermelon granita were refreshing BUT the surprise underneath (what I think was referred to as a royaltine on the menu and what seemed like crumbled chocolate/pretzel cookie pieces at the bottom) was what was really good about this dish. It helped break up the monotony of fruit flavors. Â The service overall was fast and friendly. There was a little hiccup with our waitress. She was busy schmoozing with the tables next to us for a few minutes while we sat there with empty plates, waiting to ask for a dessert menu.To her credit, she was generally friendly the entire meal, but she clearly thought other customers (probably bigger spenders) were more important and spent more time with them. BUT that definitely didn't seem representative of the entire wait staff. Â The busboys, hostesses and servers were very friendly, fast and welcoming. The restaurant has an upscale casual feel to it so it's easy to relax and enjoy yourself. Â Overall, our experience here was great and we really enjoyed the food. While this won't be a regular food destination for us, there are definitely some dishes we still want to try and hope to get to before/if the menu completely changes."
"I had the unfortunate pleasure of getting full off pre-dinner grub across the street at Au Cheval prior to Girl & The Goat. So I didn't have the stomach real estate to indulge in many dishes at this institution, as my company only ordered vegan dishes. But what we had was scrumptious.One thing that surprised me is that everything we ordered had strong flavor. None of that subtle crap here. Octopus can be very bland, but the baby octopus dish we ordered had an intense fiery palette. It was pretty good.We also ordered wood grilled broccoli, grilled cauliflower with pine nuts, mushroom ragu, and shishito peppers with miso sauce. The best out of the group was probably the broccoli. It had a strong smokey flavor that you wouldn't expect from the vegetable. The ragu included sweet potato ravioli which was amazing, but there was too little of it. Most of these dishes excluded cheese items which would have made them even better, but you have to respect the vegan option:(All of the dishes came larger than expected. The negative is that everything was a little over-charred to the point that some bites tasted burned. This is a result of all dishes except one being grilled, but unacceptable nontheless. Despite this, it was a great experience and I plan to be back soon to order a bunch of meat."
"Wow.Nice find yelpers!They have some pretty amazing food. Â It's hard to still be impressed when you walk in with pretty high expectations. Â But there dishes were pretty amazing...We were there with a group, so had a fixed menu of most of their small plates. Â Flavors were really fantastic - their veggies were most impressive: simple looking with very creative and distinctive flavors.Their meat dishes are heavily weighed towards lamb, although per the lamb eaters around the table, it wasn't as gamey as most. Â For folks who are hard core veg, may want to check with the restaurant -- the veggies tasted pretty awesome, but may have been meat stock flavored.Totally worth a visit!"
"Food was inventive, fun and delicious. Â Wait staff was friendly, efficient and quick.The restaurant and dining experience are fine for a ""one hit"" wonder type notch on your belt visit. Â Chalk it up, I've been to Girl and the Goat, done, let's move on.I tried to get a reservation for my birthday, June 16, in February. Â Could not so I took the closest Â which was June 11 at 4:45. Â Our table was the worst location I have ever had in any restaurant anywhere in the world that I have ever dined. Â People waiting at the bar were right above our head, talking and could have eaten off our plates easily. Â 4 month wait to share a table with the bar is not my idea of fun dining. Â If you go, go in a party of four because the tables for two by the bar are ridiculous.Excellent dishes: Â Scallops, Hanger Steak and grilled asparagus - I would go back and eat those at the bar. Â Superb and the Hanger steak was a good 20 minutes after all the other food and still worth the wait.Very Good dishes: Â Pig n blanket with mustard, doughnuts and escargot ravioli. Â Had the ravioli been hotter than lukewarm it could have moved up.Average dishes: Â Doughnuts, rhubarb dessert and cole slaw on ribs.Disappointing; Â Ribs - not hot, not that good.Girl and her goat are talented but when the older folks have done their one visit to a trendy place and the young crowd has moved onto the latest hot spot, then she should focus on the overall experience in the dining room. Â The four stars, really it's more of 3.5-3.75.Won't be baaaack."
"Ugh, I hate a poor review amongst so many 5 stars but here goes.We were oh so excited to finally get to try this place, I have heard/read so much and couldnt wait. Â We were extra thrilled that though we couldnt get a reservation, they would try to seat us. Â We arrived just before they opened and already had a line forming outside, always a great sign.We were seated right away but were told that we had to leave within an hour and a half, which wasnt really unreasonable, we were walk ins and they were obviously busy. Â We were seating at a communal table with others, which was fine, enough space between us to keep it semi private. Â The table was also right next to the kitchen, which was nice. Â We love to watch them prepare the food. And a healthy (number) size kitchen staff, I must say.The menu is not the norm, you have your V- vegetarian list, F- Fish and M- Meat listing. Â The portions we were told were 'tapas' size which was not a problem since we love to share and eat :)We ordered Chickpea Fritters, not bad, Sweet Potato, a little bland, a couple different breads (cheese and beet), which were not bad, the Grilled Baby Octopus, which tasted too 'charry' and didnt care for the Grilled Pork Ribs. Â I hate to say it but they were terrible, the seasoning was 'off'; the menu doesnt say what they are seasoned with, but not something we cared for andthe Ham Frites, like a salt lick. Â Could not enjoy at all.We ordered first dessert, forgot the name but had thai chili chocolate and ice cream, which wasnt bad.Personally, we enjoy eating good food and appreciate creativity but this was a little too creative and for the price, not worth a return visit, sorry. Â I feel like we paid more for the 'hype', maybe we just ordered the wrong stuff? Â Not.As far as service, great and atmosphere, the obvious draw and I can see why.I give it two stars, one just for the aforementioned service, atmosphere. Â Maybe"
"My wife and I ventured to Girl & The Goat for the first time on 4/30/13 to celebrate a milestone birthday. I had made a reservation on 2/19; most people who know this place understand its popularity and know to make a reservation well in advance, but for those of you who don't, be advised. You can generally get a reservation about 2 months ahead of time.When we arrived for our 5:15 reservation (yes, we wanted start our meal early, before the place was completely full and significantly louder), the host surprised us by sitting us at the best seat in the house, the chef's table: it's a small table for two sidled up right at the cooking line, where you can eat a meal with a little more privacy from other guests and literally watch the line of 12 cooks making all the food as it gets ordered. We didn't know such a table existed, and certainly weren't expecting any special treatment; our evening started off on a high note before we'd even seen the menu.Immediately we met two fantastic chefs, Hadley and Louisa, who were cooking on the other side of the pass from us; Hadley was on the raw station, making all the dishes with raw components, and Louisa, a pastry chef, was working desserts and filling in on the line. These ladies were extremely friendly, and we chatted with them throughout our meal about the food they were making, what it's like to work at G&TG, and life in general. Our server, Nick, was also great; we never lacked for anything, and never felt interrupted or rushed to finish.I can already see that this review is getting long, and I haven't even commented on the food we ate, which was incredible. I'll just list all the dishes we had and share a few comments on each. The menu is divided into very manageable sections, including Breads, Vegetable plates, Fish plates, Meat Plates, and then a separate section each for Oysters and Goat. Here's what we had:Drinks // (1) Glass of Malbec, (2) Blood & Goats (Monkey Shoulder Scotch, Leopold Tart Cherry, Savannah Madeira, Orange), and (3) Tempest (House Made Falernum, Blenheim Ginger, Lime, Cruzan Black Strap Rum). The cocktails were awesome.Breads // The (4) Buenos Dias bread was no exception, baked with raisins and served with coffee butter and blueberry sauce. Whaaaaat?! We could have eaten a couple of loaves each...Vegetables // (5) Sauteed Green Beans*, served with fish sauce vinaigrette and roasted cashews. The beans were perfectly done and the sauce gave it some subtle Asian flare, very refreshing. I remembered that Anthony Bourdain favored the (6) Kohlrabi Salad when he visited G&TG so we tried that, and it was brilliant, made with fennel, evalon, blueberries, toasted almonds, ginger dressing, and some sort of red olive (I don't think they were kalamata).Fish // Tied for best dish of the night was the (7) Kona Kampachi Crudo. Holy cow. You've got really tender raw fish in delicately sliced strips, with crisp, salty pork belly, a subtly spicy chili aioli, caperberries, and also some very thin crunchy crouton-type things (I think that's what they were, mostly there for texture but their crunch really added to the overall dish I think). Since it was a raw dish, our friend Hadley made it there right in front of us and totally killed it. This dish blew my mind.Meat // The other clear tie for first was the (8) Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. Another top seller on the menu, I'd imagine first for intrigue (how can you not order pig face?) and then, after you've had it once, for its taste. It's served with a sunny side up egg, tamarind, cilantro, red wine-maple, and crunchy potato strings. It's the American breakfast re-imagined, and a real show-stopper. We also tried the (9) Duck Tongues, served with tuna and black bean poke, crispy wontons, and awesome piri piri sauce. These were fantastic, slightly charred and crunchy on the outside and oh so tender on the inside.Goat // The (10) Confit Goat Belly, served with bourbon butter, lobster and crab pieces, and fennel, was great, too. Whoa now: the protein was so dense and fatty, not quite as fatty as pork belly, but still super rich and salty. Paired with the lobster, crab, fennel, and some sort of sweet-ish vinaigrette sauce thing (that's a technical term only serious foodies know about), it was excellent.Dessert // We finished with an (11) espresso from Stumptown Coffee Roasters, paired with the (12) Miso-Butterscotch Budino which came with bacon toffee, glazed pineapple, and candied cashews. It. Was. Insane. Oh and we also had the (13) Chocolate Sponge Cake*, with rhubarb and gelato. Awesome.In all, Girl & The Goat lived up to the hype. The entire experience was fantastic, from the service to the food, the ambiance, and even the little water closets downstairs. I hope Stephanie Izard and her team the best, and as many Michelin stars as they can muster. Nailed it!*These dishes were generously brought to the table compliments of the house."
"I've been meaning to write this review for a while now. I went here back in August when I was in Chicago and it is by far one of my favourite restaurants. My friend managed to get us a reservation; one of the last reservations of the night around 10 pm. The staff was friendly and our waitress was great. The dÃ©cor was nice, rustic and the vibe of the place was good. We tried the sautÃ©ed green beans, pig face, lobster bread, snail ravioli, best of three cocktail, and the peaches and blue cheese ice cream. All of these dishes were delicious but my favourite of the night was the sautÃ©ed green beans. I am a big meat lover, but the dish I remember the most were the green beans they were soo good. If you go here definitely try the green beans, you won't regret it.The lobster bread was fresh and just amazing as well. The bread was fresh, crunchy, warm, and the lobster butter that came with it was tasty. I liked the pig face; the flavours melded well together. The snail ravioli was good, but I still prefer it drenched in a garlic, butter, and cheese sauce. The peaches and blue cheese ice cream was unexpected since it was a sweet savoury dessert. Not my favourite dessert, but interesting in a good way.I loved this restaurant. The next time I'm in Chicago it's a stop I have to make again."
"I've been to Girl & The Goat twice. First, with a group of friends and then again with a work group.The service was outstanding both times. I'm typically not a fan of the small plates concept in restaurants, but the servers were really helpful in guiding the group based on a wide range of tastes (e.g. almost vegan, very spicy to no spice).My favorite items have been the in-house fresh-baked breads. They are quite creative and soul satisfying. I'm not an adventurous foodie, but I could appreciate the inventive, exotic menu options that use every part of the animal (i.e. fried pig face).I stayed with the vegetarian and poultry dishes and nothing disappointed. About one third of the menu is beef/pork, another third fowl/fish and the final third vegetarian. A great, sophisticated option for the carnivores out there."
"Oh my gosh, back again and this time it was as good as I remembered! The Pork shank with Naan and some amazing sauces along side the butternut squash ribbon (how was that sooo good)?! Â This place has it figured out...."
"We were able to sneak in and get seats at the bar. Â The lounge area was filled and the restaurant was filled with reservations.Had a few drinks at the bar, mainly wine. Â  Tried the pig's face (good!) and the escargot ravioli (meh). Â We then opted to split a dessert and had the bittersweet chocolate with shitake gelato. Â It was amazing. Â Like eating truffles. Â And the shitake added an interesting (but in a good way) taste to the gelato.I loved how everyone around the bar area was so nice - it was kind of like a family-style table. Â Lots of guys at the bar drinking and eating, the tables were filled with couples and groups.Service at the bar was also very good. Sitting at a crowded bar you wouldn't expect service as good as at a table, but they had special servers for each part oft he bar.Don't faint when you get your check, it will be worth it."
"It was a difficult reservation to get, but it was worth the wait. I loved the Wood oven Roasted Pig Face. A must try. We also had the Pork Shank and the Ham Frites which were good. The Confit Goat belly is a very small portion and over rated. Nonetheless, worth a try. I will definitely recommend Girl & The Goat to others to go try."
"Love this place much more than The Purple Pig. Very impressed by the cauliflower, and the tuna tartare had a perfect taste! I find tapa style restaurants to get pretty expensive at times, but you could get bread and interesting spread here for 4 bucks, which guarantees a filling meal without emptying your wallet! The menu changes quite frequently and is never lacking of interesting stuff. I personally am not that into goat, but the vegetable and meat dishes I have tried have all been amazing! Desserts are not too sweet which is great!!"
incredible service and top notch food. Get reservations in advance bc its hard to get a table. But well worth it.
"For a place this difficult to get reservations, the food better be good. And it was. If you can't get reservations, you can actually sit at the bar and order off the same menu.Had the- mushroom ragout- different mushrooms in a creamy sauce- cauliflower- probably some of the best I've had- mussels- wish this came with more bread to sop up the liquid- braised goat belly with seafood- also delicious but probably my least favorite- the dish didn't seem to make much sense- braised duck- easily my favorite thing I had. I would go back just for this!By the end of the meal I wasn't even talking, just smiling."
"Maybe I need to go back...since I thought it was good, but not that great.I was underwhelmed when I thought I'd be overwhelmed, especially after all the major hype. Â No reservations were made...went around 7-8pm and was told it'd be almost 2 hour wait. A friend and I went to the bar to grab a drink, as soon as we got them we walked over to the waiting area to find 2 people leaving their seats (where the walk-in table was) and we grabbed them right away! Our wait was less than 10 minutes which was awesome.The pig face and goat belly were definitely my favorite. Tasty, unique, and much different from anything I've tried. Â Most of the other dishes were just good though. Â The shishito peppers and shrimp ceviche were disappointing. Â I need to come back and try more on the menu so I can leave a better rating. Â But, my experience there, beside the quick wait, wasn't as memorable as I'd hoped."
Sorry but des not live up to hype. Â Took my husband here for birthday and barely got reservations. Â Nothing was incredible. Â Most everything was good except Â the broccoli that was so smoky it was off-putting. Â Had 7 good small dishes but nothing stood out. Â Desserts were best part of meal. Â Would not go back or recommend with the hard reservations. Would go to Publican instead.
"Yup.. This place is amazing.. I actually used to valley for the goat when in college and just after it opened up. Top chef winner is clearly doing it right and honestly, I watched her season right after I ate there. The feel of the place is trendy and classy. They have a great menu. Definitely would recommend for a small group or date. Its definitely worth, at least once. 10/10 would bang!"
"Without a doubt one of the very best restaurants around today, anywhere!Great service, awesome ambiance and the most delicious food I've had in a long, long time. I highly recommend the Confit Goat Belly and the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face, you won't be disappointed!"
The food here is amazing. it is to be expected from the only female winner of Top Chef. The wait staff and experience is inpecable. There really know how to deliver an amazing dining experience. I recomend ordering the roasted little peppers.
"If you like salty and burned, this is your place. I will say the pig face was pretty good (unlike the nasty lamb face at Xi'an Famous Foods). I wished the yolk was more runny so it would mix better with the rest of the dish. The duck tongue was a good combination of crisp outside and buttery inside. The rest of the salad I could skip. Ditto on the fried peppers -- Ippudo does it better without the bitter burned parts. The parmesan didn't seem to add to the dish as it was just A layer on top. The baby octopus was like... well octopus. Charred octopus. In short, go for the pig face and some fresh lemonade."
"Loved this place! Danielle was one of the best servers I have had a restaurant. Helped my boyfriend with his dairy allergy by literally crossing items out and circling what he could and could not eat. Drinks are amazing- loved the best of three cocktail. Food was worth the hype loved the olives, fried pickles, mussels. The squash wontons were my favorite item the sauce was filled with mushrooms and other goodies. The escargot ravioli was not for me but I could understand that it just might not be my thing. My boyfriend loved the shrimp and beef cheek. Not from the area but will definitely love to go back when in town again. Was in a Â food coma by the time dessert was offered so could not indulge anymore but maybe next time!"
Can't believe I haven't written a review for this restaurant yet. It's mind-blowing goodness ! I won't write about the food here because everything is really just amazing and packed with so much fabulous flavors. They were all small dishes so it was perfect for sharing and being able to order more of a variety of dishes. I went with a group and we literally ordered everything on the menu. We didn't make a reservation (all booked) but we were lucky enough to find seating in the bar area. They have a bar area with sofa-ish seating on the side and a larger table around the bar that is first come first serve. Still with the same excellent service and menu :) A must-try place for anyone visiting Chicago !
"Yum! Â We went to Girl & the Goat for our 2 Â year anniversary last week and all I can say is... fabulous! Â We both heard lots of great things but didn't want to have too high of hopes in case it was a lot of hype. Â We were pleasantly surprised that it was as good as all the hype. Â We had to make a reso a few months in advance but it was well worth the wait. Â We even were seated at the kitchen table (didn't ask for it) which was perfect for my boyfriend who loves to cook. Â He got to watch and chat with all the chefs. Â Even Top Chef herself was standing next to us making sure all the dishes were perfect before going out to the customers. Â Pretty much everything was great about our night. Â Our server was friendly and attentive, the food and drinks were unusal but tasty, and the ambience was better then expected! Â I would highly recommend the cauliflower and pig face. Â Both amazing! Â Also the pretzel bread is a great starter. Â Lastly, the bittersweet chocolate for dessert was different but a great end to a great meal. Â We already made reso's to go back!"
"We went here for dinner mid week. Â We were told that there were no reservations available, but they would try and accommodate walk-ins if we could avoid the prime dinner hours.Arrived around 6 pm and we were seated right away. Â The place was packed for a Tuesday night! Â The servers were friendly and explained the menu and the specials in detail. Â The plates are fairly small, so they recommended we order 4 to 5 dishes for two people. Â We did 4 and it was just enough. Â We could have probably had a 5th. :)The food was really tasty. Â My rating is based on the food and the ambiance. Â The drink menu was really interesting and they had a good selection of beer and wine. Â The cool part was that the beer was tasty and had a high alcohol content. Â I'm talking over 9% here!! Overall it was a good place for dinner. Â Good food, nice restaurant, and good drinks. Â I did think it was a bit over priced though. Â I know it's a trendy place, but we ended up spending over $100 for two people and we didn't ""over order"". Â We had 4 tapas and 2 beers. Â Nice for a date or a special night out Â or perhaps a ""treat"" dinner. Â Kinda pricey for every day."
"I must say, this place lives up pretty well to the hype! Not the BEST restaurant I've ever been to, but they have high quality, gourmet food. My friend ordered the Kalbi style beef ribs--she said it was meat-falling-off-bone good! I had the roasted cauliflower, not expecting much b/c well--it was cauliflower but BOY did the sauce, pine nuts, and mint make my taste buds happy!! Dessert was just ok for me--had chocolate ice cream + brownie + melted marshmallow, and it was way too rich and sweet for me. Still, the ambiance--trendy, romantic, ""happenin"" for lack of a better word--made me enjoy our time here immensely! I highly recommend this place for an intimate dinner date, a one-on-one catch-up with a friend, or a ladies night out if you're looking for something a little special. =)"
"I only wish I could give 10 stars. Â I made reservations a couple months in advance for my boyfriend's birthday, and I really don't think I could've imagined a better dining experience. Â Our server, Jess, was amazing and we were lucky enough to be seated at the chef's table where we able to chat with wonderful chefs all night. Â Our food lineup included the raw oysters, green beans, wood fire grilled broccoli, squash blossoms with crab, scallops, pig face, and for dessert the butterscotch budino and a taste of the sticky date cake for his birthday. Â There was not one dish that came out where I didn't exclaim, ""I want to eat this every day forever!"". Â Everything was cooked perfectly, and though we ordered a lot for 2 of us, they portioned it perfectly.I would highly highly recommend Girl and the Goat for any special occasion or any day you feel like having food that will blow your mind."
"I have been here several times over the past couple of years and every time is a treat. It's a challenge to get a reservation, but I hear if you go hang out at the bar you can sometimes get a table without a reservation - although I've never tried it. I'm giving this a 5 because it's just up my alley. I like the atmosphere, their cocktails are good and their menu is always interesting. I went there recently with my boyfriend and it was fun to try some of the more adventurous dishes with him because I knew they would be great even if they sounded out of his comfort zone. As many of the other reviews state, you have to try the pig face - if anything, just to say you did - but also because it's very tasty. However, my favorite dish that evening (besides the dessert) was the goat tacos. They usually have a whole section for goat on their menu so I always try something, and its always great.Now as for the dessert, I hope they never take their chocolate cake with mushroom gelato off the menu. We usually don't order dessert, but I'm certainly glad we did. It was such a unique flavor and the pairing of the chocolate and the mushroom was amazing. It was sort of like salted carmel/chocolate with a twist. Also - the service was fantastic. No matter how great the food, atmosphere, reputation, or cocktails, in my mind this is the difference between a good restaurant and one that I will make an effort to go back to."
"The menu from the get go was mind boggling because it was stuff ice never heard of before. Went with a couple friends and we 8 plates, almost at random. Every plate we had was unique and delicious. I got there early so I recommend getting there before it gets slammed with people. So good!"
"So I hear reservations are hard to get here? Guess I was fortunate to get in with a GrubWithUs dinner along with nine other overly excited and lucky people. All we knew going in was that we were going to be set up with the chef's selection...And we got 12 dishes! Oh man. Guess I'll write a quick thing about each dish:Sauteed green beans - flavors you wouldn't expect from a bowl of beansRoasted cauliflower - more tasty veggies, a little sourKohlrabi salad - fresh tasting, nice refresherChickpea fritters - they come out really hot - wait before biting, lolGrilled baby octopus - nicely cut, chewy but not too chewyEscargot ravioli - amazing sauce and flavorful overallFried soft shell crab pakora - Indian crab...never had curry and crab!Ham frites - delicious cheddar beer sauce, great for sharingPinn oaks lamb tartar - not overly lamb-y, also fresh tastingSugo - great pasta with goat pork and veal...great comboGrilled pork ribs - solid; didn't taste much new, but it was the last dishWood oven roasted pig face - OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMG...OMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMÂ­GOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGOMGAnd with that, GatG is my new favorite Chicago restaurant. Thanks GWU, and thanks Stephanie!"
"This was the best meal I've ever had in my life. Get the bread with apple butter; it will haunt your dreams in the best possible way. Much more relaxed atmosphere than I expected, romantic without being stuffy, comfortable din level. The parsnip cheesecake will rock your world. Go now. NOW."
"G&TG is a must try if you're in the Chicago area. Â Whether you're just visiting or you live here, it's well worth it to put a reservation on the books (well in advance).Hint: take a late reservation if you can. Â I think the place has a certain ambience later at night. Â We had a 10pm Tuesday night reservation.You'll have a fantastic eating as well as culinary experience. Â While you don't do the cooking, an open view kitchen makes you feel like you're just a step away from where the magic happens. Â My girlfriend and I received exceptional service from beginning to end, and we were even graced with some light conversation by our young table neighbors.You want a good gameplan? Â Go with the focaccia for starters with the red onion jam and mushroom butter. Â Entrees: pig face, goat belly, sauteed green beans, and chickpea fritters.For dessert, you might as well indulge! Â Order up the pork-fat doughnuts and the fudge brownie with foie gras. Â You're welcome."
Obligatory review. This place is amazing. Been here twice and haven't been disappointed. Have their barrel aged manhattan cocktail and be sure to order their green beans and pig face.
"The Girl and the Goat was amazing! My four friends and I ordered 12 items in total: Â 2 from the Vegetarian section, 2 from Fish, 2 from Meat, 2 orders of bread, 2 orders of empanadas (on the special menu), and 2 desserts. Â We each paid $37 -- well worth it Â though for the experience!! My favorite things we ordered were:Tempura Soft Shell Crab w/ sweet corn and aioli Â -- had never had soft shell crab and it was life-changing. Â The sauce with the corn was just to die for. Diver Scallops w/ foie gras vinaigrette, plums, and sweet onions -- buttery, flavorful perfection. I will probably never eat a more delicious scallop. Smoked Goat Empanadas w/ tuna cream, tomato, and more aioli -- these were crispy, delicate, and bursting with flavor. I have to get my hands on some of that aioli sauce.Goat Cheese Bavarois w/ berries and brown sugar cake -- our waiter described the bavarois as, ""if cheesecake and mascarpone had a baby"". Â It was fluffy, creamy, rich, and delicious with the brown sugar cake pieces. Our waiter Brandon was informal and super friendly. When I asked if I could have a copy of the menu to take home he said to my friends, ""why don't I give you all menus and then I can take you back to meet Stephanie?"" Â (!!!) After we were finished, we went back towards the kitchen, Steph signed our menus, and we took a photo with her. So awesome :D"
"Prepare to have a mouthgasm and expect a 2 hour wait. The decor is dark and masculine, yet inviting. I imagine if the most interesting man in the world owned a restaurant, this would be it. Lots of meat and beer on tap, with a side of mahogany. The onion brioche and roasted cauliflower are delicious and the pork shank deserves a double take. It is unbelievably tasty, just make sure to cut off some of the burnt bits, they are the best part!The deserts are quite good and different (I had the Red Grapefruit Kulfi).If you are a beer lover, you might get lucky enough to buy one of the 81 bottles of Stephanie Izard & Three Floyds collaboration. $50 a bottle, but it's worth it!Oh and don't call in reservations, make them in person - they give preference to in person reservations."
"Managed to get a 9:30PM reservation for three the day of--despite the typical 3 month waiting list. We started off with a bottle of Merlot, which was excellent. Interior:Classy, elegant. Very crowded, and on the noisier side. Would be a great date spot.Service:Very professional and knowledgeable. Also quick, even with the large volume.Food:The three of us decided to share ~6 plates.-Wood grilled broccoli: The broccoli was actually very good. It had crispy bits as well as a creamy sauce. Enjoyed every minute.-Diver scallops: EXCELLENT. The scallops were topped with a foie gras vinaigrette, and were cooked to perfection. -Wood oven roasted Pig face: Not as great as I thought it would be. My dining companion informed me that this had been much better the last time she had tried it.-Goat liver mousse: Came with buttery fluffy crumpets and several spreads in addition to the mousse. The combination of the different spreads was a perfect marriage of flavors in my mouth. Wiping drool off the keyboard as I type.-Braised beef tongue: Meh, this was my least favorite of the bunch. Tasted just like beef brisket. Would not waste time on this one.-Sugo: This was pretty good. I love pappardelle pasta, so this was the one I chose. It was a bit on the salty side, but the gooseberries added a nice sweetness to counter the salt. Wasn't my favorite, however.Overall, had a great dining experience here. I would come back to try the crudo and the kalbi ribs, of which I have heard glowing reviews."
"I went to this place based on the recommendation of a coworker, and I'm glad that I did because it was quite good. In fact, this is one of the best small plate places I can recall eating at.I had three dishes. First was goat belly confit with lobster fennel and butter. I am a big fan of pork belly (as you will know if you read my reviews), but i've never tried goat belly prior to this meal. It was a great dish. The belly isn't as fatty as pork, but it makes up for that with the gaminess of the goat. It was a really nice, balanced dish. Probably my favorite of the evening.Second, I had some seared scallops with mushrooms. The scallops were very tender and the dish was nice and flavorful.Last was roasted pork face with an egg on top. I had never eaten pork face. It basically had a porky flavor with a different consistency. It was pretty good, but my least favorite of the evening.Service was fine. A bit on the pricey side here, but the food is good enough that you can overlook the cost."
"""Pig Face"", ""Pig Face"", ""Pig Face"". Â A name I used to call my brother when I was a kid has been transformed by Top Chef Stephanie Izard into a delectable dish of absolutely tender pork cheeks and jowls. Â Mix it all up with fried egg, tamarind cilantro, and potato stix and it becomes a symphony of tastes.Do try the Wood Fired Dune Shadow Oysters with Horseradish, bacon, and preserved lemon. Â This was our favorite dish of the evening with pretty much everything else running a very close second. Â Goat Carpaccio with tongue-olive vinaigrette and smoked roe. Â Hiramasa Crudo served with Crisp Pork Belly, Aji Chilli, and Caperberries. Â Squash Blossom Rangoon with Crab, Chive Yogurt and Toasted Almonds.I usually don't comment on drinks, but the mix-master at G&G has come up with a must-try combination of Haymaker's Old Gin, Apricot Eau de Vie, Lemon and Basil, called ""Slight of Hand"". Â I don't like gin, but this was the best mixed drink I have ever had. Â Give it a shot!Our meal at the Girl and the Goat was the 2nd perfect meal that I have ever eaten in my life. Â I can't wait to go back!"
"Ridiculously good food. Â Even on a Tuesday night the place was jammed up. Â Service was slow but I think that is sort of their mo. Â Food was very good but at times I felt overly salted. Â Try all things odd here because they are surprisingly amazing.My recommendations are as followed: escargot ravioli, skewered lamb heart, wood oven pig face, confit goat belly, chocolate bouchon, pretzel bread with honey mustard butter (ridiculous), smoked goat rilette empanadas, green beans, raw oysters were also goodUnimpressed with: Â chickpea frittersYou must eat here but this is place you would hit up like 3 to 4 times a year max. Â Just very heavy meal in my opinion."
Not that g&TG needs another glowing review but after visiting recently I was not only impressed but glad this restaurant lived up to the hype! The restaurant is very open and the staff was all super friendly. I went there for dinner with a couple of friends and pretty much tried the majority of the menu. Everything was executed perfectly. Even some of the courses I thought were going to be rather simplistic had amazing complexity. The cauliflower app was definitely one. I think the online recipes must be holding back a few ingredients cause ours were a lot more complex than the recipe would seem. In all we had a great time and enjoyed the inventive food.
"So darn good, wrote a haiku:The sunny pig smilesBack against the charred cedarThe girl and the goat"
"This place is a rare treat. I made the reservation a month in advance and we got exactly what we wanted. Good service, good food and an amazing choice of drinks. I took my girlfriend for her birthday here and we wined and dined to our hearts' content. She ordered the Grilled Baby Octopus as the main meal while I preferred the delicious sugo with pappadelle. We had read about the pig face that highlighted the meal. I only have one word-Awesome!The food is super tender, working up your saliva glands and just melting in your mouth with a wide array of aromas that kept your appetite up. Save for my budget, I could have ordered much more than I could afford. But, it was a dinner to remember and now she keeps suggesting a night out at the Girl & The Goat. We will be going back in the near future and on a regular basis."
"I loved my dining experience at the Girl and the Goat. Â As a heads up, I am a huge Top Chef fan and as many of you may already know, the executive chef Stephanie Izard was the first (and so far, only) woman to ever win Top Chef. Â So I was coming in with high expectations and was not disappointed!My friends and I (group of 4) walked in on a Saturday evening, and since the wait for tables was 2 hours, we decided to wait for seats at the bar (half hour wait). Â I got the Best of Three as a cocktail, and enjoyed the cucumber hint in the drink. Â For tapas, we got the the panfried shishito peppers (yum cheesy), hiramasa crudo (how can you go wrong with pork belly?), grilled baby octopus, wood fired walter's chicken (probably the largest dish out of everything we got), and my favorite - the wood oven roasted pig face. Â The pig face was so succulent and I swear it melted in my mouth. Â A must try!"
"After the recent un-preferred experience at The Purple Pig, I thought this review was way overdue. I made a reservation 2 months in advance (they are that busy) and dined in early August.Wait time: 2 month with reservation, 20 minutes when we arrived.Ambiance: Nice fit for foodiesService: Accommodating, knowledgable staff, and on pointOrder: chickpea fritter (yum), beef tongue (yum), crab rangoon (just ok, wouldn't get again), pig face (yum, a must), braised pork shank (yum yum), and butterscotch budin for dessert (yes please!) Food was overall very good and the service enhanced the experience. I will be back, yeah!"
"It was a random Thursday when we decided to pop in and see what Girl and the Goat looked like in terms of a wait (they are taking reservations for the end of July when I called). Â The bar is first-come first-serve and we hovered over a couple who was about to leave and snagged the seats. Â FYI: full menu served in the bar.Service was impeccable. Â Knowledgeable, friendly, and fast (but not rushed). Â The ambiance was very nice - and it wasn't so loud that you couldn't talk. Â  The drinks were also very good and packed a punch. The food was, as expected, amazing. Â To start, we ordered the fresh bread with a thousand-island type butter and the shishito peppers - every random few are hot and spicy. Â  I thought both were just average. Â Then... we moved on to the fish and meat dishes. Â Wow. Â Ham frittes, Hiramasa (pork belly croutons amazing!), scallops, lamb tartar, and of course, the Pig's Face. Â  All were very good, however, a few stood out. The Pig's Face sounds a bit intimidating, but it was perfectly seasoned and came with a sunny-side up egg. Â It was probably my favorite dish on the menu! Â I also was a big fan of the lamb tartar and the Hiramasa dishes. Â We also ordered the chocolate cake for dessert. Â It was no ordinary chocolate cake. Â First, it had a crunch to it, which I understood to be salt (but yet, not salty). Â It also came with a shittake gelato (which I didn't like but I don't like mushrooms and not even Stephanie Izard can fool me). Yes, it is definitely a 5 star place. Â Is it hyped up? A little. Â I am very glad we popped in but I can't see myself coming back when you need to make a reservation months in advance. Weeks? Then we'll talk."
"Excellent food, drinks and service! Â This was our first time at Girl & the Goat and we will be back! Â One of the best meals, from start to finish, I've ever had. Â As other mentioned, the portions are a good size for being small plates. Â Three of our four plates could have been shared by 4 people. Â For the portions and quality of the food, very reasonable prices. Â The barrel aged manhattan was awesome!"
"I confess, I avoided this place for months for fear that it wouldn't live up to the hype. Â I prepared myself for disappointment and made a reservation. Â And guess what, it actually lives up to the hype. Â So make room for me on the bandwagon, I'm jumping on board!First of all, let me say that even though this place is packed, you wouldn't know it. Â The atmosphere is actually kind of homey and the service was relaxed and laid back (in a good way). Â Our server was always there when we needed him but we never once felt rushed, even though I'm sure another hungry group was anxiously awaiting our table.We all started off with a round of cocktails, although, I will say that apparently you don't come to this place for the cocktails. Â They were ok but not very well balanced. Â That's alright, they have a great beer selection and we had no problem making the switch.A few of our dishes were absolutely incredible. Â The goat, pork & veal sugo was ridiculous. Â The chicken noodle soup bread, green beans and scallops were also amazing. Â We were a bit disappointed, however, that there are only 2 very small scallops in the dish. Â They were awesome. Â We didn't care as much for the escargot ravioli or the pig face. Â The pig face reminded us all too much of breakfast. Â It came in kind of a crunchy patty with an egg on top. Â I don't know, it just wasn't what we expected. Â We finished off the meal with some ham frites, which were good, but we probably should have thought twice before finishing them off!I saw some of the desserts come out and they looked great but we just could not eat anymore. Â So anyway, I'm really impressed. Â I can't wait to come back to try more!"
"I thought I heard too much about this place and would be disappointed.I was not disappointed.I am not big on vegetables. I had a green bean dish and loved it as much as any of the meat dishes. Â Small portions, so you can get a lot for tasting and sharing. Â Service was exceptional. Â  Two of us split six items from the menu easily. Each course was as good as the next. Â I wanted to go back the next day to try 6 different choices from that menu, but reservations do not come easy. Prices are very reasonable for this unique quality dining experience."
"delicious!reservations are impossible....go early and grab a seat by the bar or lounge!!!my friend got there right when they opened and got a seat by the bar. Â the bartenders were super friendly with good recommendations. Â very attentive as well! service was quick but not annoyingly disturbing.-open face pork: delicious pork mixed with crispy potato strips and a sunny side up egg on top. Â fried potato crisp made it bomb.-goat belly-uber tender with lobster and crab meat (lobster was just a teeny bit overcooked) nice sauce combined them well.-cauliflower-very greasy but wasnt mushy and had a nice char. Â pine nuts add extra texture along with the pimientos. bit too salty for me-shrimp with pork ragu: love the meat + seafood combo. Â ragu was a bit too salty for me. shrimp was nicely done topped with spaghetti squash.-choc cake with shitake reduction: can totally taste the mushroom! nice balsamic reduction. cake was super moist and yummygreat service, nice decor, yummy food! just a tad salty for me..but otherwise drooool...."
After booking reservations two months ahead of my Chicago vacation..I was super excited to end my vacation with a top chef restaurant. Â Stephanie amazed me so much with this fun and hands down the BEST dish I've ever had in my life - Pig Face. Salivating already at the thought of the crunchy potatoes mixed in with an over easy egg blended in with big chunks of pig face meat..simply a masterpiece. I will forever remember the meal. Thank you Stephanie for allowing me to bug you for a photo op in the midst of a busy crowd rush!
We had a group of 6 and surprisingly managed to get a table without a reservation with minimal wait time (a few in our group have a way with words that apparently swoon ladies). Were seated at a communal table by the kitchen which proved to be great people watching entertainment. Was a bit loud but what do you expect for a hip Chicago establishment? Hunter was our waiter and was awesome. We asked for his recommendations and got a number of waves of food. My faves were the oysters (first timer!) and escargot ravioli. The cauliflower with mint and pine nuts was very good as well - who would've thought mint and cauliflower would go so well together?!Unique flavor pairings that made for a wonderful dining experience. Will definitely be back!
"The Girl and the Goat is the new restaurant by Stephanie Izard, winner of Top Chef. Barely open a year, it has already won a James Beard award, and is the hottest restaurant in Chicago. I reserved our table three months in advance.I was a bit wary of going the day after Moto, and some of the menu items seemed a bit scary (oven roasted pig's face). What a delightful surprise this restaurant turned out to be! We loved all the plates we shared. We tried all three fresh baked breads of the day. Each was served with two different accompaniments, such as Worchestshire butter. Our favorite dishes were:Wood fired chicken with fried pickles and grilled naan.Sauteed cauliflower with pickled peppers, parmesan cheese, mint leaves and pine nuts.Goat belly confit with lobster and crab.Service was really professional yet friendly, and the vibrant environment and wood smoke filled room is the perfect setting for such fun and tasty food. The Girl and the Goat is a new Chicago favorite."
"This place is fantastic on so many levels.Level 1. I have a soy allergy. And unbeknownst to me, Chef Steph is a big fan of the stuff. Both the staff and the chefs were SO accommodating. They went so far as to give me my own ""customized"" menu showing the things I positively couldn't touch and what they could modify. I was so impressed and appreciative.Level 2. The recommendations from my server were spot on. I got the goat carpaccio, the roasted cauliflower and the scallops (modified on their arctic char preparation). They were all fantastic. I really couldn't get enough of the cauliflower--amazing flavors.Level 3. Probably one of the most unique desserts I've ever had--the bittersweet chocolate cake with shiitake caramel gelato. Lawd. I am going to dream of this dessert for years to come. And probably try to replicate it unsuccessfully over and over again. My great server nailed it when he described it as ""an earthy Oreo.""Level 4. Great vibe. After I solo'ed dinner at the bar, a friend came by for drinks and the waitstaff was just as attentive as we lingered for a bit too long.Level 5. Great wine selection. Great cocktails. I loved this place. It's a must-try."
"There are some to-die-for dishes, and some are just ok. Â The best group size to come here is 3 or 4 people. Â Most of the dishes are large enough to split for that size, but it'll be just a few bites/taste of each dish. Order the right things & your meal will be wonderful. Â FAVORITES of the evening in order were pan fried duck tongue, pig face, & goat liver mousse. Favorite dessert was chocolate bouchon. Had the following dishes:Goat liver mousse (w/ peach mostarda, corn relish, crumpets, pickles)- 5 stars, LARGE portion. Â Can be filling b/c the crumpets are generous in size. Â I spread a lot of mousse w/ a little of all the other ingredients on the crumpet. Rich & creamy w/ a sweet aftertaste. Crumpet is served warm & fluffy.Pan fried duck tongue (peaches & plums, cherry tomato, chilli oil, coriander)- 5 stars. Â Small portion. Â FAVORITE of the table. Â Duck flavor was very evident despite small tongue size. Cartilage is already removed, so all you have to do is eat & enjoy. The ends were crunchy and the tip was chewy (think meat). Nice texture, nice flavor. Â A must-order. Â Wood Oven Roasted pig face (sunny side up egg, tamarind, cilantro, potato stix)-5 stars. Â Medium portion. Think pig cheek meat..braised to perfection. Outside was charred crisp (yum!) with a rich, melt-in-your mouth tender meat inside. The waiter recommended you cut the meat & egg into pieces (so tender doesn't require knife) & mix everything together. Â Great idea! Â Egg went well with the meat & the potato sticks underneath gave a nice crunch. Roasted cauliflower (w/ pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint)- 3 stars. Large portion...can feed up to 6 people. Â It's good for cauliflower, but in general, it was just ok b/c it's just cauliflower. Â Had a slight citrus flavor & pine nuts added crunch. Â Not sure why it was so raved about.Kohlrabi salad (fennel, evalon, blueberry, toasted almonds, ginger dressing)-4 stars. Small portion. Â One of the better salads i've had...full of flavor & very unique flavor. Loved the toasted almonds although it made the salad a bit salty.Hiramasa Crudo (crisp pork belly, aji chili, caperberries)-4 stars. Â Wish they gave more pork belly...the portion was so scarce, but was so delicious & had a nice crunch. Â Interesting combo with sushi (I think it was yellowtail underneath). Â Wood fired razor clams (chilies, peanuts, nuoc cham)-3.5 stars. Small portion. Â Few bites..had an asian fusion flavor. Â Escargot ravioli (bacon, tamarind-miso sauce)-3.5 stars. Medium portion. Â Ravioli texture was perfect, filled with hot, tender escargot. Â Dish was topped with a bunch of dried, fried onion..which overpowered the dish...so we left most of the onion in the bowl.Sauteed hawaiian sunfish (broccoli-nectarine kimchee, dandy greens, caper brown butter)-3.5 stars. Medium portion. Fish had a slight crisp exterior with soft interior. Â Good, but nothing too special. Â Dessert:Chocolate bouchon (foie fluff, salted toffee, milk chocolate sorbet, gooseberry compote)-5 stars. Â Rich dessert but not overly rich or too sweet. Â Nice chocolate flavor with some crunch. Â Loved the burnt marshmallow served with it. Â A great last bite to end the meal. Â Goat cheese bavarois (brown sugar cake, citrus blueberries, marcona caramel)-3.5 stars. Â Waitress described it similar to a cheesecake, but it's nothing like one. Â It's not dense like a cheesecake. Â If anything, it was fluffy goat cheese atop a cake with a toffee crunch on top. Â Good, but no where as good as the chocolate bouchon."
"Finally came here after years of wanting to. It is so hard to get a reservation, we had to book it 3 months in advance. Stephanie did NOT disappoint.  We got this pretzel bread with honey mustard butter. GET THAT. I could eat it all day, everyday. We had some bitter chocolate desert that was to die for. Ham frites and green beans were also simple but very good. The only thing I did not care for was the chickpea fritters. They were just kind of plain. Everything else was delicious. The place is pretty affordable for being what it is. 3 people, 7 courses and a $40 bottle of wine ended up being 190 with tip. As Martha D says below, bus boys and chefs are sexy and nice to look at. I dressed pretty nice, but ended up being very dressed up as a lot of the hosts and guests were in jeans. BUT I will be back soon, Stephanie."
"Well. Â What else can you say about a place with 1900 average 4.5 star reviews. Â It's amazing. Â In every single way. Â Chef Stephanie is one of the most inspiring in the food world today. Â Even though she has a place so packed you can't get a good reservation for a month and it's been this way for a long time, she's still innovating and getting better. If you want to walk away from a meal wanting to learn about your meal, this is the place to go and regularly come back over and over."
"Wayy overrated and over-hyped. I mean the food is decent but nothing was extraordinary.The service was really friendly though, but it really doesn't deserve such a high rating."
"I've been dying to eat here since I heard that it was open. That would however require a) very advance planning and b) a plane ticket. I was smart and called in March to reserve a table since I knew I would be in town and this was at the top of my eat in Chicago tour. You won't be disappointed. Seriously. Like N.B. said ""Go. Just go."" I too feel like I don't need to run through each and every course we had. I will say this, making reservations in advance was great. Service was awesome, they were so friendly. I even got to meet Stephanie while she was working on the line. Seriously amazing. If you find yourself here you MUST order the chickpea fritters. They were to die for. I still am thinking of them a week later. For real. The scallops were awesome, the goat meat in the bowl was a surprise but it was a good one! Everything we had here was awesome. They brought an extra dessert because it was my birthday and I don't even like chocolate cake but I could have devoured this one on my own. Just go here ok?"
"This is one of those places that I will go to every time I go to Chicago. Â I have been twice and both times were outstanding!! Â  I am not going to go into every dish that we have had there because I really can't imagine that you can go wrong with anything you choose. Â For example, the waiter recommended green beans. Â We thought, ""I don't know, green beans? Â How good can they be?"" Â WOW!!! Â I really had no idea that frinkin green beans could be so good!!!! Â I don't think that you can go wrong with anything that Chef Stephanie Izard creates here. Â The prices are not bad at all either; for 5-star cuisine. Â The atmosphere is amazing too!!! It's not a white table cloth stuffy / snooty atmosphere, it's kind of loud and fun and .... just trust me it's a great restaurant!! Â My fiancÃ© and I both agree that we have had the best meals of our lives at Girl and the Goat!!Book early though...really early cause this place is booked months in advance. Â It's the first thing I do as soon as I know that I am going to Chicago; book a table at Girl and the Goat!!!"
"These guys aren't exaggerating. We had a reservation for 12am (yes, really) and this place did not disappoint. Every single dish we ordered was absolutely delicious. **Tempura loup de mer filet - Absolutely incredible. I keep having taste flashbacks over this dish. **Sauteed green beans - These are not your everyday canned/frozen beans. Oh no. These are tasty and have a flavor that can't be beat. **Wood fired walter's chicken - This must have been marinating since I was born because there is no way chicken can be this moist and flavorful!! Â **Fat bread - Pretty good, not really spectacular but still pretty good.**Cocktail - I don't remember the name of it, but boy was it strong--but very well mixed, and delightful!The service was supurb. Not one single misstep--water filled, dishes cleared and check delivered. The atmosphere was nice, we actually struck up conversations with the tables on both sides of us about the food and both parties said the same things about their food. Five stars for this wonderful restaurant!!"
"My friends and I took our chance to come here at 5pm without a reservation. Nonetheless, we were told the wait could be up to 1.5 hours. We took our chance and waited for the few seats in the front, which are for people without reservations. **the bad**I was a bit annoyed at the host/hostesses at the front don't really manage this front area. For example, if someone is done with their meal, the group of people waiting closest to the abandoned seats tends to get the spot first. Using my once-Midwestern-charm, I told a couple trying to take some seats that we had been waiting ""a lot longer"" than they had. It was an awkward position, and I feel that it is one that the restaurant should try to avoid for customers.**the good**Nonetheless, once we finally sat down, it's safe to say that the food here is stellar. I highly recommend the sweet potato gratin. It's addictive and cheesy goodness. My two friends and I also go the scallops -- probably our least favorite, only because it was not as impressive but still good -- beef tongue, and pig face. Yes, they serve pig face here, and it's delicious. My one complaint with the beef tongue dish was that there wasn't enough beef, but the dish overall had some awesome flavors.At the end, one friend and I surprised our other friend with the chocolate cake. (It was her birthday!) I loved the lightness of the cake, and the shiitake ice cream on top will not be forgotten.Our waitress, Mandy, was really outgoing and down to earth. Definitely a splurge kind of place, but it was super awesome and very memorable."
"I was really excited for my reservation I made 3 months ahead of time. Â Unfortunately this place does not live up to the hype.I have to put a disclaimer: Â I only ate vegetarian plates and cannot comment on the meat dishes. I realize that this place prides itself on meat but, one third of the menu is vegetable dishes. Â Why should a place of such high standards even have them on the menu if they are mediocre?Every dish we had was guilty of one of the unforgivable sins for a place of this caliber, that it was way over salted. Â They use such fresh beautiful ingredients that it was sad to see everything overcooked and smothered in sauce which you can't even tell what's in it because it tastes like salt.Everything else about the place was great: service, atmosphere, drink selection is decent. Â But food is number one for me and I left disappointed."
"Stopped by Girl & The Goat for a friend's birthday. Patrick was our server. Food was delic, but the only thing that bugged me was the $15 ""Cake Cutting"" fee. We brought our own cake amongst 10 people, but didn't know they had a cake cutting fee until we received the check that for each cut on the cake [5], there was a $3 charge... Overall, great food and I loved the Baby Octopus."
"As a tourist, I did my typical yelp homework (sort restaurants by 'most reviewed') to easily find the most popular places, and then checking opentable. The fact that the nearest reservation was in mid-September instantly told me that this is probably the most-hyped non-fine dining restaurant in Chicago. Not surprising given that there's a Top Chef, an obsession with pigs/goats, and a huge amount of reclaimed wood; i'm surprised cupcakes aren't on the menu somewhere.I bought into the hype and instead of doing the reservation thing I just walked in at 5:30 hoping to snag a bar seat or a no-show, and if that didn't work, I'd just walk over to the Publican. Of course, the restaurant was totally full; this place is to hipsters/foodies as Lou Malnati's is to overweight middle America families. I ended up taking a no-show's table after 10 minutes.Tried the following dishes:Green beans - The fish sauce vinaigrette was subtle and left me wanting more, and the green beans were perfectly cooked. Unlike Ronald E, I would pull a Ken Marino and in fact, dip my balls in it. Â A pretty good dish.Beet salad - My DC wanted beet salad, it was alright, nothing to write home about.Fried oyster - Excellent. Great presentation, crispy like the dickens, and super briny, right up my alley.Squash Blossom Rangoon - I considered getting another order. Ridiculous.Grilled baby octopus - My favorite dish by far. Tender, great ingredients, and as Tom would say, perfect amount of acid, but a little too salty.Oven roasted pig face - by yelp reviews this is THE dish, but I really didn't go cray cray for it. Was it good? Sure. Pork and eggs are always good but I didn't really care for the sweet sauce or the consistency; it actually reminded me of a high class refined version of Spam minus the nitrates. I like Spam, I like pork, I like eggs, but this dish kinda fell flat for me.Goat belly confit - I really can't get behind lobster + savory meats (outside of surf and turf). Maybe my palate isn't sophisticated enough but pairing rich lobster with even richer belly meat just doesn't work. I appreciate the excellent ingredients and technique but this dish just isn't me.Would I come here again? Sure! Service was excellent, drinks were good, awesome ambiance, I would love to come back to Chicago and try the rest of the menu. Nothing was even close to bad, I just didn't end up liking the mains as much as I thought."
"Extremely pleased. We went during NATO weekend so NO WAIT! Also, I think we got the best seats in the house- right at the kitchen. It was so entertaining to watch your meal being made in front of you and to talk with the cooks. Price- honestly not that bad. We got 9 things for $91.92! Quantity- small, tapas portions, but since your meals are spaced out you will get fullQuality- Superb! Everything was so good! What we loved in order: 1. Confit Goat Belly2. Mini Fritter3. Mini Quatro4. Red Tea Brulee5. Chocolate Dessert6. Octopus7. Scallops8. Busta RyeAtmosphere- very modern and cozy- not pretentious like other placesStaff- Fantastic. They know they are the best restaurant in town, but they still treat you like you matter.Cannot wait to go back! Just hope China doesn't come out with a spin off...""Girl IN the Goat"""
"Girl and the G.reatest O.f A.ll T.ime! Â Definitely worth the hype. Â We've eaten here about 4 times and it never disappoints. Â The scallops, goat empanadas, Walter's Chicken, and the goat shank are among my favorites. Â The meats are always tender, well seasoned, and just damn good. Â Service is always great, food is consistently awesome. Â Did I mention it was worth the hype?"
"This place is A MA ZING! Had a 10:30 pm reservation we made a month prior to our Chicago trip (only one they had available) but we happened to stop by when they opened and got super lucky, they seated us right away! Only catch was we had to get up at 6 pm, which was when our table was reserved. This gave us time to enjoy 3 plates each and a bottle of wine with time to spare.In terms of the food, Pig's face sounds so unappetizing to me so I swore I wouldn't order it but when my friend got her dish it was so delicious I just had to get my own. Definitely glad I took the risk, as it was my favorite dish there, very unforgettable & delicious. Also had the Kona Kompachi Crudo which was amazing. However, a very small dish! The seared Ahi Tuna was barely average. My least favorite out of the three I had. I don't remember which Pinot we had but it was also a great recommendation from our server. Loved the food, wine and great service!"
"Food: 5Decor: 5Service: 5Stephanie Izard, you are amazing.Came here with my gf and her roommate for dinner 9pm Monday, and it was one of the best meals I've ever had.1. chickpea frittersstewed and fresh chickpeas . pickles . red onion . crave brother's mozzarella~Pretty good.2. hiramasa crudo crisp pork belly. chili aioli. caperberries~Okay. Pork belly was very small, and I wish there was more of the accompaniments for the crudo to balance it out.3. grilled baby octopus guanciale . favas . ramps . radish . pistachio-lemon vinaigrette~Really good. 4. diver scallops braised duck . marcona almond butter . green papaya . green almond nuoc cham~Delicious. 5. Confit Goat Bellybourbon butter, lobster n' crab, fennel~Delicious. 6. pig in a blanket breadgreen pea puree, mustard butter~Okay. Sliced bread with pork baked in middle, server's recommendation.7.

Chocolate Cakemousse, blackberry sorbet, lemon cocoa nib cream, pate a bric~Delicious. Better than Mindy's Hot Chocolate, and one of the best desserts I've had in a while.Total was $35 pp before t/t.Service was superb. Pace and progression of dishes were excellent, and they fired them out quickly, one after another. If I lived closer, I'd come here all the time.Atmosphere is very loud, and music selection was excellent.Tips:1. Valet is $10, although there is street parking if you're lucky2. Recommend ordering 2-3 dishes pp. Dishes are small and ideally shared between 2-3 people."
"Holy crap holy crap holy crap. I had a bunch of review drafts sitting around, since I was putting off yelping for a bit, but after eating here, I hopped right back into yelping so that I could write about this place for my 200th review. I came here for dinner with my bf and roomie, and we waited over a month for 9pm reservation, but this meal was truly incredible.Here's what we ordered:1. Chickpea fritters - good, kinda reminded me fried tofu lol, paired well with the mozzarella2. Hiramasa crudo - okay, didn't really stand out3. Grilled baby octopus - good, interesting textures and flavors(Okay okay, here's where it starts to get amazing)4. Diver scallops - amazing, I keep trying diver scallops and each place also trumps the last, but I think I've now experienced the paragon of diver scallops5. Confit goat belly - amazing, the crab/lobster unexpectedly went so well with the goat belly6. Pig in a blanket - amazing, we originally didn't want to order bread, but saw another table had it so we changed our mind and got this and holy moly7. Wood over roasted pig face - amazing, well seasoned and amazing textures/flavors8. Chocolate cake - amazing, I usually don't like fruit paired with chocolate cake, but this was one of the most amazing desserts I've ever had.So now we're done talking about the food, lets move onto the service. Service was impeccable. They kept my water glass full, which is difficult for most restaurants since I drink water like a rabid camel (2-3 liters per day, easy) and down 4-5 cups when I go out for dinner. The pacing was also perfect, as they definitely knew which dishes were better than others, so our food only got better and better. I would definitely return, since this was one of the best meals I've ever had, on par with Alinea and Takashi."
"Even before I set foot in Chicago, I had made it a point to come here. Â My entire trip was focused on stopping here for dinner one way or another. Â And with the tough reservations to get, I even made it before I planned the rest of the trip. Â And lucky I did, because it was worth it....really worth it. Â As one of my friends would describe it as: ""BOMB DOT COM"". Â smh. Â the lingo these kids have nowadays. Â And although they didn't have some of the stuff i wanted, I still got to try a bunch of their other dishes that were still pretty good . Â The ideas, the serving size and tapas style is great. Â It makes me wish more types of these setups existed in sf. Â However I do believe we're getting there, now with State Bird Provisions, Frances, and all. Â What better way to enjoy a meal than to congregate with one thing in mind, experience as much as possible in a good company of people sharing the enjoyment. Â That's what came out of the meal because every dish was unique in its flavor and every dish had something to offer. Â And just to top it off..the libations were just as intense. Â -Fried Duck Tongue - the most interesting thing to find here since I've only seen this served in dim sum places and it was delicious-Cauliflower - simple yet delicious-Pig Face - so rich but also pretty good-Goat Belly - so rich with lobster and crab around. Â this needs to be cut down a notch. Â Not complaining, just sayin.-Peppers - simple, but still good-Octopus stew - deliciousness -Pretzels with a thousand island like dressing - tasty...reminds me of monk's kettle but not ass good.And although I thought a meal like this would cost an arm and a leg, the portions were decent and the price was reasonable. Â It is definitely a must!"
Visited while in Chicago with my Husband and two boys 12 and 8. The boys loved all of the seven dishes we ordered but our favorites were the Braised Beef Tongue and the Pig Face. Loved the atmosphere and enjoyed eating an unusual yet delicious meal.
"I went here last week, after wanting to try it out for a long time. True to form, this is a review for the bar area only, as my broke ass can't afford dinner here. Our group of five had an amateur sommelier in the midst who picked out a delicious Reisling for us to drink. I'm not a fan of sweet wines, but this one was fantastic - and not sweet! Yum!The appetizers we ordered were things I wouldn't have ordered, but will now order again. Pan friend Shishito peppers in cheese - deliciously hot, but mellowed by the melted cheese. Raw oysters - what's not to love about those bad boys? The other appetizer we got was a sort of chickpea salad with cheese in it that was also very good. Gorgeous bartenders - looks like there are a few bartender/models in the midst. Yum. Very attentive and friendly as well. I love the decor in this place. One wall was all black, charred wood. Very dark wood throughout and interesting, sort of filigree details behind the bar. Modern, yet comfortable.I also like the smell of the place - a smoky aroma on entering. I'll be back."
"So overpriced and overhyped! The pig face, quinoa ravioli, Â duck duck goose (bread, duck fat butter, and blackberry jam), diver scallops, and confit goat belly were all okay. Sure, the dishes were interesting and different from what we usually eat, but not worth the price tag. Our only favorite dish was the hirame crudo. The crisp pork belly was a nice touch!The wait time between dishes was perfect until the last two dishes. It seemed like forever! Service at the communal table seems to be lacking so if you can wait, try to sit inside."
"Truly a special restaurant! Â I had heard so many great things about this restaurant that my expectations were through the roof, and yet somehow it lived up to them. The only downside to Girl & The Goat is the need to plan ahead. Â After three dates with a girl, I made reservations for her birthday two months away, hoping that she'd still be in the picture (she was). Â It made for a very special birthday dinner, and for the high quality of the meal, the prices are very reasonable. Â The two dishes that really stood out were the scallops (best I've ever had) and the reconceptualized PB&J for dessert. Â If you know you want to impress someone a few months down the road, make your reservations now!"
"Got lucky and walked in on a Saturday night. Some group had cancelled and we were seated in 20 minutes...this NEVER happens! You have to make reservations pretty far in advance to secure a spot. This place is always packed! The menu changes up a bit but they have some staples on the menu which are always available. Â I have tried the goat empanadas, zucchini bread, roasted brocolli, roasted chicken and crispy mini beef short ribs. Warmed olives and a few other items. The menu is definitely outside the box of traditional food. I wasn't blown away by any dish at all. The portions are very small and seemed to be served more like tapas style. Absolutely nothing stood out as spectacular BUT the vibe is great, Â as is the bar. U get seated near or with other ppl which is pretty cool in my opinion. The place is always busy with chatter and laughs and located on a good strip of other businesses and nightlife adventures. So this is a fun place for friends and drinks and not your usual hum drum menu. So if you're looking for a good time, this is it....but the food is just OK, interesting but just ok"
Very very good service but the food is so so.
"This was the first time I've been to the Midwest. Â My friend was talking about the great BBQ and fat foods they have here and all I could think was ew. Â I am not a fan of BBQ and I seriously am coming to the conclusion that I am the only person who does not like it. Anyway...The Girl and the Goat reminds me of a restaurant that would be in San Francisco. Â The food was pretty good. We got the mushroom ragout, fried chickpeas, sauteed shrimp and peanuts, and the pork bone. Â The best was definitely the pork bone. Â The meat just fell off of it, it was so tender. Â But, it would've been better if it wasn't roasted so long because it was a little dry.The ambiance is kind of weird. It looks like a cabin made by Ikea."
"Billy Goat, Curse of the Goat, now The Girl & the Goat. Â After eating at the Girl & the Goat I can see why Chicago is so obsessed with goats. Â The atmosphere is casual but also classy. Â I had a reservation on a Sunday at 5 and was starting on my first course within 15 minutes. Â My friend and I tried the frog legs, roasted cauliflower, halibut, and the goat empanadas. Â All of the dishes were delicious but the halibut was absolutely amazing. Â After devouring the dish I was debating ordering two more servings. Â The final price tag for four dishes with drinks was around $60 a person which I was happy to pay considering the quality and uniqueness of the dishes."
"Girl & the Goat had been at the top of my ""must try"" Chicago restaurants list. However, snagging a reservation there is legendary for its difficulty. However, after two of my friends won the Book of Mormon lottery I was feeling down and like I needed some really good food.So I headed to West Loop and went inside to scour for a seat at the bar. Once inside I faced the conundrum about what to do as a single diner when the bar had an even number of seats and vacancies always appeared in pairs of two. I let a couple opportunities go by to waiting couples before a waitress noticed me looking indecisive. She helped me find a place and started off the really excellent service I received here. Eventually I was seated next to the two couples I had let sit down ahead of me, and all of us ended up talking and having a great time.Girl & the Goat really makes it accessible for single diners through the communal bar and the ability to order half priced smaller sizes of some dishes. It's not like Sable where everything can be ordered in a half, but they do have a lot of options so single diners can try multiple dishes affordably and without bursting out of their pants.All in all I ordered half orders of the Roasted Cauliflower and Escargot Ravioli as well as full orders of the Corn Bread with Goat Cheese Butter, Pig's Face, and the dessert with goat cheese, berries, and a brÃ»lÃ©e topping. I ended up sharing food with the couples sitting next to me though and also tried 5 other dishes on the menu. Everything was at least very good and the Pig's Face, Bread, Roasted Cauliflower, Sugo, and Pork Shank (last two ordered by the people I shared with) were absolutely amazing! There is some childlike wonder to getting a well composed, pretty dish like Pig's Face and then be handed a spoon and told to embrace your inner child and mash it up until it is unrecognizable but oh so delicious. The tender pork, the rich egg yolk, and the sauces run together to create a beautifully harmonious dish with a presentation that remind you of your best experiences cooking with your mom as a child, mixing and mashing things with wild abandon.All in all I came into Girl & the Goat with high expectations and left feeling like they were exceeded. And feeling like I got the better deal over my friends who saw Book of Mormon from the front row. For that, 5 stars."
"Extaaordinary food but pretty horrible atmosphere. We had the bread with hummus, a kohlrabi salad, the broccoli with blue cheese and finally, the bay scallops and the brenzino. Best food we have eaten, anywhere and we have dined all over the world. Pluses for creativity in flavor and flavor combinations. Wait staff were extremely attentive and explained everything well. BUT, the restaurant was far too loud! My wife and I could not carry on a conversation between the crowd noise and the music. This is all fixable with acoustic treatments. Though we loved the food, it just wasn't pleasant ultimately with the high noise level. We found this to be true as well at the sister restaurant, Little Goat. If this continues to be left unaddressed, Ms. Izard may discover that a lot of customers are like us- we visited once, but we absolutely will not be back until acoustic improvements have been made."
"Dinner 6/30/12The 5th star is deducted because this very popular and relatively pricey restaurant hasn't put an awning on the front of a west facing building. Â Meaning if you sit outside during dinner because its impossible to get a table inside without an inhumane wait, you bake in the sun and heat. Â Now onto the food:We ordered the pretzel bread, grilled broccoli, squash flower w/ crab, scallop w/ duck, ribs.Pretzel bread was delicious but one of the spreads was kind of gross. Â Looked like cheese with tomato but tasted like mayo with french dressing mixed in. Â The honey mustard butter was more honey than mustard but it was tasty. Â They gave us way too much of both toppings. Â I don't like that because its wasteful.Grilled broccoli was awesome! Â Definitely would get that again.Squash flower w/ crab--This needed something else to it. Â I just wasn't very flavorful. Â I liked it but wanted something to make it pop. Â I would suggest they make it spicy! Â Some ancho chile sauce would go a very long way on this one. Â Scallop w/duck was fantastic! Â Already thinking about the next time I get to eat this. Â The slaw with it on the side was nice and sour and crunchy. Â Love duck, love scallops--prepared perfect! Â Ribs were good but I have had better. Â I wasn't super thrilled with the seasoning on it. Â Cooked really well and tasty but could have been better.Dessert: Â We had two of their options--chocolate cake and goat cheese cake. Â They sounded awesome but they were not anything to write home about. Â Okay flavor. Â Pretty small for the price. Â Service was excellent. Â I would go again. Â I would not wait 1.5 hours to eat here because no place is worth that. Â Luckily we were seated immediately outside because we braved the sun and heat. Â If they buy an awning they are 5 stars for sure."
"Been here about 5-6 times, tried most things on the menu, have not been severely disappointed yet. Favorite dish: toss up between the magic green beans and pig face (cause I am a serious egg whore). Make sure to mix that pig face real good. Cocktails are passable. The menu itself is pretty much standard Chicago gastropub/new-american fare. It's not that this place does anything crazy innovative (anymore), it's just that it does it really well. Possibly only surpassed by Longman and Eagle. Also I might regret posting this, but reservations aren't completely necessary. Walk-in waits for 2-3 people are about 40mins - 1.5hrs (depending on the day), but if you can snag a bar seat you have full access to the menu. I've had door-to-dining without reservations within 10 mins on record days. That being said if you have a full party of 8, well, you're on your own."
"FAMOUS FOR (My ratings in parens)- Pig Face (2/10)I TRIED- Sauteed Green Beans 5/10- Seared Scallops 8/10- Steamed Clams 8/10- Crisp Skate 6/10- Grilled Lamb Ribs 0/10- Chickpea Fritters 4/10- Scalloped Potatoes 6/10- Lotsa Other things...I had a hard time being excited to go to this. There was nothing in me that really wanted to go other than the rave reviews I heard from others. But the funny thing is, none of those people actually went to Girl and the Goat, they heard from their friends that this place was phenomenal. So, no one from our group actually went or actually knew what to try. So, we all whipped out or iPhones while waiting to be seated for our reservation that took 3 months to get! I mean, any place that has that long of a wait list has got to be to die for! Right?....right?....The place looks pretty neat. Pipes running across the ceiling, dark walls, wooden columns, and just all in all pretty modern looking, but with rustic accents. I really did like the whole combo, it made me anxious about what was to come.Their beer list is decent, they had Anchor Steam, which is one of my favorite beers that you don't see too often in Chicago. They had a pretty decent wine list too, but I opted out when I realized this was sort of a tapas-style joint. They had about 6 or 7 cocktails that were expensive, but I'm not really one for them, so my input is useless there anyway.Ok, so, if you're bored already, then you're getting the gist of my experience. I mean, the company was great, and I had a great time, but the food, was just...MOST IMPORTANT THING TO GLEAN FROM THIS REVIEW:The food is tiny. Tapas style, $6-7 for a standard dish, $13-16 for expensive ones. Our table of 10 ordered about 25 dishes, and everyone ordered 1-2 drinks. They recommend about 2 dishes per person, and share them all. We pretty much just ordered double everything and each group of 5 shared a dish. Including tax and tip, each person paid about $60-65 for that.PIG FACEI honestly thought it was going to be a pig's face. I couldn't imagine so many people actually coming up with the balls to eat off a pig's face, but I couldn't think of what else it might be. Really, it looks nothing like a pig's face. It's basically nonsalty Spam with the consistency of liver, and a fried egg on top. Not terrible, but not good either. Nope, can't see what the fuss is about.GRILLED LAMB RIBSI hate lamb and I hate gamy. Well, the Grilled Lamb Ribs at Girl and the Goat is MOTHER FREAKING GAMY! After seeing a lot of veggie dishes and not-so-fulfilling dishes come across, seeing a giant rib got us guys all excited, but then after the first taste, I wanted to spit it out. Everyone's comment was that it was really gamy. The only thing that our side of the table was offered from the other side was the Lamb Ribs. I think we actually took it, but nobody touched it. SEARED SCALLOPSNow, these were really good! It was in sort of an orange sauce that complemented them very nicely, almost buttery, and was seasoned just right. I'd recommend these to anyone.ALL IN ALLThe food is really not exciting. I can guarantee you that I will never crave anything from here, nor will I even think about or remember what I had here, because it's really all that forgettable (except the lamb ribs. I've never had anything so gamy and disgusting)! Would I come back? Nope! Would I come back given a free dish? Considering the drive I'd need to make to get there, nope! Would I come back if they comp my whole meal? As a person who checks woot.com every day, I'd maybe come back for the deal, but there wouldn't be an ounce of excitement or anxiety for the food. I'd just get drunk off of Anchor Steam!"
"My girlfriend and I came in for our 1 year anniversary on a Saturday around 5:30 pm. Â We waited for a table for about an hour and enjoyed a good libation. Â Our waitress was on par and extremely knowledgeable. Â I would venture to say that goes for the entire staff just by observing the restaurant. Â We looked over the menu and basically told the waitress to bring us her favorite dishes. Â -Fried oysters on these cool little spoons. Â Just perfect from the oyster to the batter to the creamy sauce. Â -Green beans crunchy, fresh, and the cashews topped them off-The pork shank...oh the pork shank and the sauce...We weren't able to finish it so we trucked it home....the sandwiches I made the next day with it were awesome. Â Someone tell me what this sauce is! Â -The scallops were so tasty....pomegranates made these quite unique. Â Obviously The Girl & the Goat has become this iconic foodie restaurant in Chicago...and rightly so. Â  They are 100% committed to amazing food every dish every day (I would assume based on the rest of the reviews). Â I'm just excited to hit up Little Goat across the street."
"This is the first restaurant I've given 5 stars. If I have the stomach space, I would've ordered everything on the menu.I flew into Chicago on a business trip and have heard great things about this restaurant and of course I drooled when I looked at the menu on line prior to my visit.My friend and I ordered the ""not cambell soup"" bread, it was delicious with the tomato oil and i believe the other one was mushroom butter. Â We ordered a few dishes to try because it's not small but yet filling.My favorite was the crisp braised pork shank with buttermilk dressing. Â The outside was crispy but the meat was very juicy and tender.The desserts really blew my mind. Â We couldn't decided and ended up having the top three:Bittersweet chocolate with shiitake-caramel gelato, parsnip cheesecake with tamarind caramel pears, and the pumpkin pie gelato with spiced cake, spiced pecans, and thai whipped cream. Â For the price of this meal, I would definitely go back there if I visit Chicago again."
"My boyfriend and I believed the hype, we've been wanting to try this place for a while. We finally got our chance last night and it was pretty underwhelming.We got:chickpea frittersgarlic potato wontonssquash blossom rangoonham fritespig faceThe fritters and squash blossoms were much heavier that we imagined they would be. Very heavily battered and deep fried, which is tasty, but not necessarily skilled. Then the garlic potato wontons were soft, more like ravioli or pierogis than a crispy wonton. Ham frites was just misleading, it was placed under the Meat section so we both envisioned lardons of bacon with seasoned potatoes. What came out was french fries with about a tablespoon of what I can only describe as ""ham dust"" on the top. The pig face was over done. The egg was over cooked so it didn't run into the rest of the dish the way it was supposed to, the edges of the meat were past crisp to burnt. Didn't live up the hype I'm a little disappointed to say. I've definitely had better meals in a quieter, less crowded environment."
What can I say that hasn't already been said? I have been wanting to eat here ever since it opened. I got there at 4:30 on a Friday without a reservation and ate at the bar. It was a memorable and delicious evening. The bartender waited on me and others with just as much care as if I were at a table. Everything I had was wonderful. I had goat carpaccio w/smoked trout roe and an olive-maple vinaigrette - really nice. I also had a delicious roasted beet salad and a tasty bread with ramp butter. The stars of my meal were the stuffed squash blossoms - so good! I finished with a light and perfectly sweet milk chocolate and galangal napoleon - with rhubarb and passion fruit. My drink was a delicious tequila concoction and was also wonderful. Because I was alone and sitting at the bar I met a really interesting woman who has turned out to be a great connection - so a excellent experience overall!
"Can we spell overrated? Â The food falls somewhere between mediocre and good. Had to make reservations 6 weeks in advance for this restaurant and I was as excited as Ive ever been to dine at a restaurant. Between watching her win top chef to reading the reviews, I thought this place would be nothing short of the second coming of Christ. Â  If anyone wanted this restaurant to be great, it was me. The dishes we ate on our visit were GOOD, but it was not the mind blowing, epiphany creating, fantastic food I've been reading about. Â Because we couldn't make up our minds on dishes, we relied heavily on our servers recommendations. We decided on chickpea fritters, fried oysters over egg salad, the infamous pig face, goat pappardelle and dessert donuts cooked in pig fat. The best thing we ate that night was the dessert, it was totally delicious. Â Chickpea fritters were good, the oysters were good, the pig face is good, but Â tasted like a crispy piece of glazed ham.But it was all just GOOD. Nothing special. Maybe some day I will be back, but I will not go out of my way to make a night of it."
"Soooo, yeah. Â I made reservations for my birthday dinner about three months out, and was really looking forward to trying this place. Â Honestly, it was good, and I'm glad I tried it, but I can't imagine I'll be back anytime soon. Â It's a smaller plates kind of place, so my husband and I ordered four dishes for the two of us. Â We started with the broccoli smothered in some sort of blue cheese sauce which was really good. Â Second plate was the goat belly which was served with crab and lobster, I think. Â I have to say, this was not a winning flavor combination - it had a bad fishy flavor and I didn't want to eat any more of it after the first bite. Â Disappointing, since goat is supposed to be the ""thing"" at this place. Â Third plate was escargot ravioli, which was tasty. Â And the final dish was the pig face, which was definitely delicious. Â And we also ordered their peanut butter and jelly bread, which I thought was sortof bland and underwhelming. Â The dessert was bad. Â Bad bad bad. Â I had the chocolate something or other, which was the most bizarre assortment of flavors. Â EVER. Â It was a bits of pistachio cake, some dark raspberry gelato, some hard chocolate shell poured over everything. . . . and there was one more random flavor added in there that I can't remember. Â But it was just very random and I couldn't quite figure it out. Â Each piece was fine separately, but together they were a mess. Â My husband had the cheese platter and had no complaints there.Service was fine. Â So yeah, it was a fun night and we tried some new foods, but I don't know if I'll be back and it definitely wasn't worth waiting three months for a reservation."
"Wonderful, wonderful food. Between the two of us, we ordered 5 plates total AND two bread plates. Yikes. There's three categories: veggies, seafood, and meat.. A very clever and fun way to accommodate dietary restrictions. I was definitely full mid-way through the meal..but the food was so good, I honestly could not stop (I sound like I have problems...oops). My favorites were the tempura soft shell crab with sweet corn, some type of salmon tartare, peter piper bread plate, the pigs face (which was phenomenal!) and the sweet corn with peaches dessert. But don't be fooled by the small portions, it is pretty heavy!The service wasn't totally amazing. I love having servers that are totally outgoing and love to joke, or at least be amused at my jokes. But our server was just nice and pretty mellow. Would've liked to have a little more color, but I wasn't disappointed with it.I loved the ambiance though--approachable fine dining. You can be eating oysters, drinking some expensive wine and at the same time listening to hip hop or hipster music. Super fun and relaxed.For those of you trying really hard to get reservations! My tip is to just go for any time that they have available, and you won't have to book a month ahead!"
"Had a great time at Girl and the Goat. Went with 3 other people and had a great time trying new foods and ordering a ton of small plates. The ""Best of Three"" drink was also absolutely delicious and refreshing. Â Our table had several favorites of the night and there wasn't really anything that disappointed. We didn't love the flavor of the duck in the kimchee, but when we ate the duck with a little bit of the sauce left over from the green beans, it was wonderful. We had a great waiter too -- steered us away from a few things and towards some wonderful plates that weren't on our list. Â Awesome night out in the city!"
"This was easily the best meal I had this year. Thanks to all the enthusiastic endorsements from fellow Yelpers, I decided make this my dinner spot for my only night in Chicago. With inventive dishes such as Goat Liver Mousse, Roasted Pig Face, and Zucchini Cake along with excellent and attentive service (even at the bar), this place definitely deserved my five stars!"
"Loved this place.My husband and I went here for our anniversary dinner. Â We weren't able to make a reservation because the place was booked already. Â Instead we went and waited for a table to open up. Â It was probably about a 40 minute wait. Â While we waited, we had a few drinks at the bar. Â I had ""4 in the Same"" and ""Best of Three"". Â Strong but delicious!When seated, we were told we had an hour and a half to eat until the next group came in and that the waiter would try his best to get all our food out to us as soon as he could considering we were limited on time. Â That was fine with us. Â Waiter was good. Â There were a few minute breaks where we finished our platters and were waiting on the next one, but that's fine. Â We ordered five different platters to share. Â Their menu changes a lot. Â But from what I can remember, we had some escargot, some beef tongue, and pork belly. Â Every single dish was excellent and had its own blend of flavors. Â There's a reason why they serve the dishes separately. Â I loved that each dish had a combination of flavors that worked well together. Â You can't eat one dish while also eating another one because it takes away from how it's supposed to taste. I absolutely love this place and would definitely go back!"
"Great dinner last night at Girl & the Goat. Cocktails: we had a bourbon-based cocktail ($13) that also included Campari. Can't remember the name, but it was very good. Food: I was dining with a friend who doesn't eat red meat so I didn't get to try the goat dishes or the giant beef shank. We had: Wagyu Beef Tartare ($15), Walt's Chicken ($22), Mushroom Ragout ($7), Shishito Peppers ($9) & Diver Scallops ($17). Tartare was perfect, seasoned well & served with roasted uni. Portion was a bit small though. Chicken was incredible, I'm not one to typically order chicken in a restaurant, I find it pretty boring most of the time. Walt's Chicken was incredible, half a chicken roasted with a great BBQ sauce. I loved it. Diver Scallops were very good, loved the braised Brussels sprouts. Mushroom Ragout was served on sweet potato (I think) ravioli, super rich, creamy sauce. Shishito Peppers were roasted and spicy.Service: Prompt and efficient. The restaurant is larger than I anticipated and there were small hiccups, such as dirty plates sitting too long on our table, but overall service was good."
"Totally loved it and def will come back to try everything else they have in the menu! We had Escargot ravioli, Â Crispy duck tongue, beef tongue (yeah, I Â was in the tongue mood), bread Â and some awesome salad (don't remember the name of it, but it had beans and beet). Everything was very delicious and well presented. I would say that beef tongue was nothing Â special, but still good enough to have it. My grandma makes beef tongues better, so I am very experienced with those :) PS I made a reservation in the end of November to get a table on the weekend in January."
"I was disappointed. I don't get why this place gets so many 5 star reviews except for the great service and ambiance. 3.5 stars if I could. :( Â I don't consider myself a hard reviewer but Girl and the Goat did not meet my expectations. 1. Pig Face: may have liked it more but the dish was followed by the Goat Belly and they were both prepared similarly. Too greasy for me. Â 2. Green Beans: why so salty??? I love fish sauce...but whoever prepared this dish did not taste it because my table drank 2 pitchers of water afterwards. Minus the salt, beans had perfect crunch.3. Goat Belly with Lobster/Crab: Lobster and Crab done so right. Thank goodness for a good dish. Goat Belly was tender...didn't need my knife.4. Octopus: 5 star dish. All sorts of greatness in this dish. Bites of pistachio and edemane. Â Too bad the other dishes didn't live up to this one. 5. Chicken Liver Bread: Hot bread with carrot pieces and chicken liver butter. I love pate, and with butter it's double better. Â Also came with carrot butter which complimented the liver butter but I felt the bread was something I could have baked from my bread machine. This restaurant is loud and fun. Still had a great time despite my mixed feelings on the dishes."
"Epic saga, about a girl, a dream, and some pig face.I knew I was visiting Chicago in a month. I knew I wanted an incredible place to eat, but where to choose? i'm on a reasonable budget (Alinea, OUT), wanted somewhere exciting and fresh, and of course features amazing food. With a little googling, a little yelping, I realized Girl and the Goat was the perfect fit. Aha! Now to make a reservation.Snap. As we all know, reservations here require about TWO months of notice. So I make a sadface reservation at 10:45 at night via opentable, then call the restaurant to ask what the deal was with walk-ins. Very unpredictable the girl says. Can be up to two hours, the girl says. My heart crumbles. Â But come in before six and it's a much better chance of a short wait, she says. Ahhaaa.So after a long day of sight-seeing, we get our groggy selves ready from a nap, take a cab from our South Loop hotel (make it in six minutes), and we're in the door by 5:33.And we're shown right to a communal table. There were two other couples already there (sitting next to, not across from eachother). We got seated with our backs to the kitchen; I immediately ask if we can sit across from the kitchen (because you want to see that stuff).Now for the food. Service was amazing. No need to extoll the fantastic service, it was flawless and attentive all night from every angle. Â It was in service of the FOOD.Drink: Orchard Dram (pretty sweet, pretty tasty, but mostly very pretty).Food: Apple bread (whole pistachios, two types butter, amahzing.)Four wood fired oysters, horseradish aioli, bacon. drool.Chickpea fritters: fritters on their own were crisp on the outside, a bit wet on the inside, forgettable, generally, but with the peppers, the entire plate was just REALLY good. Fighting over the last bite good.Himachi crudo: elegant and delicious. If you like raw fish, you will probably like this.Pigface: sounds so .. adventurous, but the waiter described it as a ""breakfast dish."" It's not really all that scary. But it is GOOD. It's not sausage, it's not scrapple, it's like this perfectly textured, marinated some strange part of pig with soft egg and poky potato straw things that's just nom nom nom.Walter's Chicken. When he ordered chicken, I was like WUT. Â But this chicken was by far the best thing we ate that night. It was the best chicken we've ever eaten. Even though I was exploding with food, I had to keep picking at this chicken. The chicken comes with these ""extra's"" (naan, fried pickles), whatever, knock that bullshit to the ground, save room for the chicken. It was succulent and tender and just everything that is good in the world.Dessert: not that good. food euphoria averted any complaining, but the chocolate bouchon was just really forgettable. even the ""foie fluff"" just tasted like marshmallow.AND our check was $150. TOTAL. with four drinks and all that food. See what I mean? Go. There. Now. Ish."
"Posting this review w/ mix emotions. Â Its really based on the level of service at the bar, which is sad b/c the overall restaurant should not be penalized for the actions or lack there of a few meat heads, but it does represent our fair feelings when we left.First - After hearing about how difficult it was to get 'into' this place (do people really wait months for a reservation?), we took a chance on a sunday night and walked in with the intention of sitting at the bar. Â Arrived at ~6pm. Â We were surprised how...not busy it was. Â There were plenty of seats at the bar and and a lot of empty tables.Service - This is purely our experience at the bar w/ the 3-4 male bar tenders working sunday night. Â  We should have known things would not go well after we sat down and no one greeted us at all....no eye contact, no one coming by to say hi, nothing. Â And that was the story of the night. Â The bar tenders are clearly, too cool for school for anyone sitting at the bar. Â Complete tools is another way to say it. Â From ordering drinks, to asking for a menu to every order we wanted to make after that for more drinks and food, we had to verbally get someone's attention. Â The issue I have is they were not that busy. Â The 'boy's basically sat back there and were entertaining each other. Â As the guest seemed to be an annoyance for their social interactions w/ each other (including one tool doing standing pushups against the bar and the group of them doing some dancing and clapping during some song that came on) ....My female friend said it best ...""that was fun watching those guys bl*w each other.' Â About as obnoxious as i have encountered in a long time. Â I can't remember the last time I have not tipped 20% and on this night, except for my personal embarrassment and integrity, I tipped 15% and felt that was too much. Â Food - Awesome!!! Â This was the difference between a 2 star review. Â We loved everything we had! Â Oysters, Beet Salad, Scallops w/ duck & pork ribs. Â All of it was beyond good and worth the trip on its own. Â  Â  Overall - Decor is very cool, food is amazing, but the bar service was so over the top bad that it left a real bad impression on us."
Can you say more? Amazing food. Amazing service. One less star because I had reservations and still waited for an hour! They did make up for it with some complimentary appetizers.
"Did not live up to the hype. But then, how could it since it was so hyper-hyped?Yes, it was very good. Yes, it was very unique. Yes, the service and decor were top notch.However, I must say there was nothing that really amazed me (you expect to be amazed). There was nothing that I would make it a point to come back for. In a word, I would describe G&G as a 'novelty'. Once is enough for me."
"Since my last review, I have been back here 5 times. The food has gotten SO much better since they first opened. I highly recommend this place. A few must try include the Walter Chicken and the Pig's Face. They are AMAZING! Every now and then they would include a few new things in the menu, but these two items have been on their menu every time I've been there.One little secret for you if you want to eat there on a fri/sat night and forgot to make reservation. They have this lounge area to the left of the restaurant. The past few times I've been there, I just ordered a drink (or two) and waited until there is an opening at the lounge area. The serve the same menu as in the restaurant. In my experience, the wait is usually much shorter than putting your name down. Give it a try!"
"Absolutely delicious. Â Been here 3 times with my ex, one birthday and two anniversaries, so you can't go wrong coming here. Â Delicious food, love the breads and the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts. Â Servers are always super nice and friendly. Â Never go home without sampling some of their caffeine."
"Ever go to a restaurant alone and wish that you didn't go alone because of the lack of company? I came here alone and was glad that I did because I didn't have to share any of the dishes with anyone. It was that good.I ordered the chickapea fritters, the escargot raviolis, and the ruby red bread. The chickapea fritters were fantastic! I would say that it's a must. When I come back here, I will order these again, no doubt.I also got the escargot ravioli. Very good but nothing really interesting about it. The ruby red bread came with 1000 island dressing and a Swiss mustard butter. So good. I highly recommend ordering one of the bread choices. You won't be disappointed with the selection. I had a glass of the Girl and the Goat wine and it paired very well with everything. It's a white wine that's slightly sweet and quite crisp. Service was great. My waiter was really nice, helpful, chatty, and attentive.Can't wait to come back when I'm in Chicago!"
"Definitely 5 stars for Girl and the Goat! Be advised that this restaurant is definitely worth the wait for a reservation. Â My fiancee is not one for adventerous dining experiences so I decided to come here with one of my foodie girlfriends. Â When we first arrived and checked in for our reservation we were seated within 5 minutes. Â For starters, the cocktail and wine/beer menus were to die for.For dinner, we had Pig Face (A MUST!), wood grilled brocolli (it is mixed with blue cheese and this is the reason I am coming back again as it just isn't the same when i tried to make it at home), escargot raviolo (good, but didn't compare to the wood grilled brocolli), confit goat belly, and a bread. Â We ordered way too much food but that couldn't stop us from ordering dessert, especially since we saw them being delivered to neighboring tables. Â The only downside to the restaurant is that it is noisy. Â It was hard to talk at dinner but with all this amazing food it is a small price to pay."
"As everyone else has said the food here is amazing but the restaurant overall is not 5 star worthy, so I'll break it down. Food quality and creativity - 5 starsDecor- 5 starsHosts - 3 stars, but only because the one who eventually sat us was friendly, the rest were rude and unfriendlyBartenders - 2 starsServer - 5 starsSo my husband and I arrived around 9 on a wednesday not expecting that we would even get a table given everything we've heard. We sat at the bar and added our name to the waitlist for a table. We have no problem waiting, we are used to eating late and we normally prefer sitting at the bar. When we sat down at the bar, we were not greeted with even a ""hello, welcome to girl and goat! Will you be dining with us this evening or just grabbing a few drinks?"" Â No, instead we were handed 1 drink menu and then asked 15 seconds later ""what can I get for you?"". Â  We then had to tell or barkeep that we would like a few minutes to decide and would like to order food, to which the bar tender responded with again just 1 menu. Â This is not a Michelin star restaurant, but it's a nice place nonetheless. And in such a place, I should not have to ask for a second drink menu, a food menu and then again for a second food menu. Â One of the guy bar tenders was at least somewhat friendly and helpful but the female bartender just needed to remove the stick from her butt and be friendly. Â  As a bartender, you have two jobs - make good drinks and be courteous and helpful to your guests at the bar. Now, we finally sit down around 10:30 and the host who sat us could not have been nicer. Our server came up and greeted us in a friendly manner as would be expected. ""Hi, welcome to girl and the goat! Have you been here before? No? Well then let me walk you through the menu"". That my friends, is appropriate service to start off a meal. Now for the food, as everyone said, the cauliflower is to die for. So much flavor. And just a tad bit of butter. Ok more like a ton of butter but that's what makes it taste so good. The bacon and Gouda bread with romesco sauces and back fat butter - amazing. Hamachi crudo was the only dish that was just eh. Fish quality was okay, but the dish overall was lacking acid and the more developed flavor profile of our other dishes. Â  The goat empanadas with grilled blueberries were so creative. And then came the crispy braised pork shank which was outstanding. Essentially it was a deconstructed giant chicken wing. Very creative and super flavorful. All in, we are very glad we went here for one of our only 2 nights in Chicago because the food speaks for itself. Now if only their bartenders could learn some general standards of service it would be 5 stars hands down! Â Oh and the drinks were just okay. I love creative cocktails but I make fantastic cocktails at home so I am definitely critical of drink menus. My husbands old fashioned was delicious. My Paloma was just that - a Paloma, nothing more and there wasn't much else on the drink menu that got me excited. Again, go here for the food, just don't expect much from the hosts or bartenders."
"The Girl & the Goat is the best place I have eaten in the city of Chicago. Whenever my mom comes to visit we do our best to eat a meal at our favorite Chicago restaurant. The string beans are to die for and the fried watch oysters are absolutely wonderful. To be scared by the egg salad oyster combination, it simply melts in your mouth in the best way possible. Whenever we go we always order those two menu items. Seriously, anyone who goes there will not regret it. Girl & the Goat is a Chicago gem."
"it was alright, I was expecting better. Â Roasted Pork face was my least favorite because it had no flavor. Pork Shank was delicious! I loved the sauce that came with that. Â The ambience was dark and hip with a open kitchen which i thought was cool. Â But the overall experience was ok... It's overrated, I wouldn't go out my way for it."
Probably just my opinion but I really didn't care for the menu at all. I would definitely recommend looking at the menu online (or on yelp) before deciding to go
"My experience at Girl and the Goat was one of the best meals I have had in this city. It was delicious comfort food that was absolutely perfect for wintertime. Yum! My favorite dish of the night was the pig face. It was tender, succulent, and tasted creamy and delicious. I loved the little potato sticks and the egg. I just wish there was a little more cilantro sauce. We also had the squash and sourdough breads, which were great. The green beans were also good. Both my boyfriend and I loved the Ham Frites, which were perfectly cooked thin french fries with pork goodness on top. Yum. For drinks, I loved the Aviation, which is popping up in a lot of restaurants these days. Theirs is fabulous. I also liked the best of three drink, but if I had to pick, I'd go with the Aviation. I am excited to come back here someday, since it was so great."
"So many reviews can't be wrong, The Girl & The Goat is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to period.My favorite things we tried included the pretzel bread, the sauteed green beans, and the chickpea fritters. Â The best dish was definitely the pig face, complete with a sunny side egg on top, and served with sweet red wine-maple and tamarind. Â The drinks we had were amazing as well.The service was fantastic and prices are completely reasonable for the quality of food. Â If you can't seem to get a reservation, you could definitely grab a few drinks at the bar and hope to get seated if you come before or after the main dinner rush."
"If I were to review this place the first or second time I dined here, I would have hands down given it five stars. The food and service were amazing and impeccable, the only complaints I would've had then is the fact that it took me forever to get a reservation, which sucks when I live only steps away from here. Third time is not always a charm apparently, Â except for a last minute reservation I was able to snag for last night. It was still early i guess, so not super busy. Our waitress was underwhelming, not super helpful or informative, or interested really. Just there. The servers/bus boys kept rushing us, asking at least four times if we were done with our plates which clearly had plenty of food still uneaten. The odd thing is we weren't event here for that long, under an hour, and they were still rushing us. Another thing that I don't like about this place is that b/c it's small plates style (but not small plate prices) they tell you to select all the dishes you want to order, list them for the server, and the server will course it out for you. But the have an odd way of coursing. They bring a cold, raw crudo dish out after bringing out a hot, heavy empanada course. They brought out a hot, fried chickpea dish prior to oysters, so maybe it's just me, but the ""coursing"" is odd IMO. The food here in my past experiences has been superb. Their lamb tartare with english peas is out of this world. As was their beef tongue, which I've had on multiple occasions in the past. Had it last night, and it was completely dry and sliced way thicker than I've had it here in the past. It was heavy handed on the sauce as well. Maybe a one-off, but just sensing a slight decline in the quality and service, which can be a big deal with the prices they charge for their small plates. I did notice that Stephanie was not expediting as she generally has been on my previous visits, so maybe that has something to do with the changes, but maybe the novelty is just wearing off for me. Anyway, I am still eagerly anticipating the opening of her more casual spot across the street where the now defunct Red Light used to be. If you have not been you probably should still check this place out, but I'll be on hiatus for a while from the goat."
"The food, the service, the ambiance- everything was 5 stars.TIP: Book in advance- like not for tomorrow but for next weekend. Â Or... walk in without a reservation- they do their absolute best to try and seat all walk-ins. Â My sister and I did just that. Â We were informed it would be an hour wait- it was about 15 minutes max before we were seated.The style: This is a Tapa-like restaurant- think 3-4 dishes including the bread for 2 people.The menu: Â Separated by types of food: Bread. Oysters. Goat. V. (Vegetables) F. (Fish) and M. (Meat besides goat).Bread: Roll with a green butter spread was delicious. (unknown name)Oysters: Â Personally I have a texture issue and have historically stayed Oyster-free but was also very curious. Â Our waiter, Tony and his assistant Ryan, suggested the Woodfire Oysters for a newbie like me. Â They tasted amazing but I could not get beyond the look and texture. I would still recommend them to those that don't seem to have my strange issue. V: We skipped vegetables all together.F: Tempura Soft Shell Crab. Â Good although I would try something else next time. Â This tapa was supposed to come with sugar snap peas and it did- 3 of them- so don't bank on this tapa for getting your veggies in for the day! The crab was breaded and possibly deep fried. Â What I liked the most was the free-floating crab meat in the broth which occasionally had a nice kick to it.M: We ordered goat which does not fall under the meat category at Girl & the Goat as it has its own heading. Â Therefore no ""Meat"". ( Meat recommendation by our dining neighbors: Get the PIG FACE- contrary to popular (or just my) belief it is not served in the form of snout and empty eye sockets. Â They shave the meat off the face and serve it like a hash- or so I am told- and is supposedly the BEST TAPA on the menu.)Goat: Ok, this was a tough one for me. Do I really want to eat baby goat? Apparently I did. I gave it a whirl and got the Empanadas. Â The goat meat reminded me of pulled pork without the barbecue sauce. It was very good tasting. Â I think next time I will order the Goat Belly. I know. I know. Â Goat BELLY. Disgusting right?! Â The couple next to us ordered it and could not stop moaning and groaning over how finger-licking awesome it was. Â Apparently the broth is a Vanilla Bourbon Butter sauce that is heavenly.Ambiance: Â We were seated outside at one of two long picnic tables that were painted black- a sophisticated picnic table so it seems. Each table had ~10-12 people which allowed us to get to know our various and ever-changing dining neighbors. Â We were able to strike up conversations and participate in sing-a-longs and celebratory cheers with people on either side of us. Â Plus you get to ask random people about the food they ordered. Â Have you ever spied a dish that looked so scrumptious you followed its delivery from the kitchen to the person who ordered it and then wondered: Is it as good as my watering mouth is telling me? Or What is THAT!? Well, this seating arrangement allows you to find out all about that entree (and about the people eating it).Service: Â The amazing time we had would not have been possible without our waiter Tony and his assistant Ryan. Â Although they served the entire outside together we did not want for anything. They were personable, fun and great at what they do. They worked feverishly and with such synergy it was inspiring to watch."
"What to order right now if you are trekking this boisterous road (seriously, what is up with you, dining establishments of Randolph Street? Don't secretly wish you were a night club, you are just about perfect as you are. For realz):- the scallops; they are always on the menu in some sort of surf & turf way. Do it.- the quail- the pork shank- the green beans, over and over and over againWash it all down with their take on strong Belgian ale, the Girl & the Goatee. It will send you back with its 8% but it pairs perfectly with most dishes.And don't forget to order desserts. PLURAL."
"Over rated. I think that sums this place up. It is good, but way over rated. It certainly isn't worth waiting 2 hours for a seat at the communal table like my wife and i did this past weekend. And it certainly isn't worth making a reservation 3 months out. My experience with the food was that everything was REALLY Heavy/Creamy and REALLY Salty. Yes, it mostly tasted good, but it oozed down my throat like a tub of lard, and sat there like brick afterward. I didn't even eat that much. I do need to go back again to order a few more things, but this restaurant does not deserve to be the hottest restaurant in Chicago. Stephanie Izzard has quite the marketing machine apparently..."
"I feel like something is wrong with me for not thinking this place was absolutely amazing as the hype made me believe. I will admit, maybe it was all the build up that helped me be let down, but I didn't think it was anything revolutionary. There are a lot of other places in Chicago that feature this type of cuisine and while the Girl and The Goat's food was good, it didn't seem better than any of the other places like Publican or The Purple Pig. We actually had a reservation and we still had to wait for-ev-er. They came up and apologized to us at the bar area which we were crammed in, but didn't really offer anything to make up for it. I would definitely go there again, but you won't see me waiting three months just to get a table. I'll go somewhere else."
"I finally got my Girl and the Goat on a few weeks ago! Albeit at 9:45 on a Tuesday due to the popularity of this place, but even at such a late dining hour, the social and comfortable atmosphere, service and food made this a truly amazing and unique dining experience. Â We arrived a bit early and were told that we could not be seated until our entire party was there. Not a problem because the bar was kickin' and we were able to sit and enjoy a Pumpkin ale before the rest of our crew arrived. We were seated very promptly once we were all there and were greeting almost immediately by water and our smiling server who was excited that it was our first time dining there. She told us to go with two small plates a piece and was very thorough in her explanation of each dish. She also had no problem answering our many questions and never rushed us into a decision. We had a mushroom allergy at the table and they were very accommodating despite so many things having traces of mushroom. If you are going to go, I highly encourage getting there during the months of October and November for their autumn inspired menu. We enjoyed so many different flavors of the season starting with roasted cauliflower (slightly salty but we actually couldn't stop eating it), and the wood grilled broccoli (this did not blow me away but the others at my table loved it). From there we moved onto the kona and it took us a minute to realize that the crisp pork belly is literally crisped pork belly in the form of a crispy wafer on top the raw fish. Â We were definitely expecting actual crispy cooked pork belly but nonetheless the fish was super fresh and it was an overall tasty combination. It just got better from there - escargot ravioli, the scallops, pig face, kalbi beef ribs and the pork shank was to die for. It's hard to believe that the 5 of us still had room for dessert but OMG was it amazing. I can't remember exactly what we had (PB & J plus something with chocolate) but within minutes there was nothing left.Here's the climax...5 of us, 10 plates, 2 beers each and dessert and it only came to $60 each. I was ready to toss the $100 dollar bill that I had saved just for this dinner onto the table but that wasn't necessary! You can fill yourself up on these amazing small plates, enjoy some beers and even have dessert without completely breaking the bank. LOVED IT! Will definitely be back!!!"
"yum. pigs face, octopus, scallops, escargot ravioli, and that kimchi thing on the shank. It's one of those places where you cannot describe the food. the pictures speak for themselves. we made reservations months in advance for a trip to chicago and highly suggest you do 4 months ahead. The place is way off the loop and it's dark inside, with a huge bar and open kitchen. great ambiance, though.overall, YUM!"
"Really good.... if you love pork. And 500 servers per table. And more pork. With all the hype, I had to try this place, but as someone who does not eat pork, my options were extremely limited. We went with a group of 10, and we decided to order 3 things each and share amongst everyone. Three each? At these prices?? I was expecting a lot bigger portions, but they are almost tapas-sized. The seafood dishes were spectacular, but I literally only got one bite of each (so, like $12 worth of each...).I loved the wine I tried and my friends had a great variety of beers to choose from. But what drove me crazy is the amount of staff constantly at our table. Yes, attentive service is GREAT and often hard to find these days. But it got to a laughable point when someone would fill up my water glass every two sips, and THREE times we had to stop a buser from trying to clear a plate we weren't done with (wait! That's there's only five bites worth of that dish and you're taking away a third of it!). Plus, with how packed tight we were (and seated right against the cooking station), there was already a TON of traffic around all sides of our table, but I got so annoyed in having to bob and weave every four seconds for another buser to reach over me for something else (which, again, we weren't done with). I could barely have a conversation with the people next to me because there was another buser arm in my face every four seconds. Overall NOT a comfortable dining experience with the noise level, heavy traffic, and intrusive staff. The decor was adorable, the wine was good, and those that eat pork loved the pork entrees, but for all the unwarranted hype and the HUGE bill we had at the end, I won't go back. If I want arms wailing in my face while having a conversation, I'll just have dinner with my Italian step family."
"I don't know how I haven't review GATG yet (okay i say that for too many reviews, im aware) but better late than never!What can I say that hasn't already been said? Â I'll just put it like this. Â For the price point, you will be very hard pressed to find this kind of attention to quality and detail at any level.Staff, food, drinks, ambience, they have it all.Seriously try the cauliflower, it will change the way you think about veggies as a dish..."
"Finally the 2-month wait has ended! Â Well at least for me, but not for the other thousands of people who are dying to get through Girl & the Goat's (G&G) doors! Â For those fellow Chicagoland Yelpers, I'd say G&G is a fusion between Longman & Eagle and the Southern. Â It possesses an interior of an old rural barn with charred wood accents, low lighting, and antique touches here and there. Â For a bit of juxtaposition, they throw an adorable, cartoon goat in the mix on the napkin wrapper to keep the place from becoming too fancy. Â With the fabulous waitstaff and dishes, there's potential, but something always brings it down to a casual comfort level.Our waitress Chris was soft-spoken and fabulous! Â She was not afraid to make suggestions or help us decide between two (or more) tough decisions. Â I'd recommend two dishes per person, maybe three max. Â The portions are pricey but you receive your monies worth in not only size but also that almost everything is grown/raised by local farmers. Â We began with the Chickpeas Fritters with romesco, hazelnut hummus, sesame and goat feta. Â These little suckers melt in your mouth! Â The hummus with goat feta is a perfect combination with almost an Indian twist. Â Based on others' Yelp reviews, I also ordered the sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette. Â I don't mean to be rude but these things reeked. Â However, once I bit down they were perfectly crunchy and tasted nothing of their aroma. Â I would go to the point of sayuing that I could come to G&G for dinner and simply eat all veggie dishes!For ""entrees"" we ordered the Goat Masala Pizza with various cheeses, rapini, sweet cipollini onions, and a house yogurt. Â Now I have to say it doesn't beat the Minced Mint Lamb Pizza at TinyLounge, but it definitely comes in at second place. Â The masala takes place of the tomato sauce and keeps those flavors spinning on the tip of your tongue, while the cipollini onions are opposingly sweet and zingy. Â Another favorite entree was the Braised Beef Tongue with masa crisps, beef vinaigrette and salsa verde. Â The display is simply gorgeous but the crispy masa and hidden salsa verde underneath made these thinly sliced tongue bits pop. Â Many people would make a stinkeye at the thought of eating tongue, but if they didn't know that this wasn't Chinese mongolian beef they'd think it was the best they had ever tasted!We finished out dinner off with the Bittersweet Chocolate cake. Â The cake had little chocolate bits inside to give it a crunch, while the side of melting Black Dog shiitake gelato added on to the dish's many pleasing textures. Â Who knew mushrooms and chocolate would go together perfectly?! Â Well it does and the mushroom gelato tastes almost like cream cheese.Overall G&G leaves me wanting more. Â It's an amazing way to celebrate an special evening and trying items your may not necessarily eat otherwise.Awarded Review of the Day in Chicago, Illinois on 03/13/2011!"
"So I was happy with everything I ever experienced here. However on the other side I felt nothing was truly amazing. It was all good, just not special. And considering how hard it is to get a table I felt something should have been special. But I tip my hat to the beverage program, 5 stars! All of the bartenders are very talented too. Especially Josh!"
"Believe the hype.Goats travel in herds, and just like a goat you should travel with a herd when you visit. Here's why, you go with a bunch of people you can target the weakest or strongest (we have automatic weapons) goat. Take it out and let the crew at G and G prepare their goat leg for you. They bring this thing out on a plank and you can eat it all Game of Thrones style, minus the incest. And if you go with enough people you can order a bunch of other stuff to go with your goat leg. Other highlights. Pig face, goat liver mousse and the chicken.With the Bravo show pedigree and the upper crust raves this place could be a overrated as RPM, but it's not. It's awesome."
This place is great. The food is culinary road trip!!! Â Busy and great energy! Â Go there !!!!!
"INCREDIBLE!!!! Â Neither my boyfriend nor I had ever been to Chicago, so we really didn't know where to go for a great dinner. Â After reading online reviews, we tried out Girl & The Goat. Â Like other reviewers said, I'd definitely recommend making a reservation. Â Our food was OUT OF THIS WORLD delicious! Â We had the Roasted Cauliflower, Kohlrabi Salad, and Pork Shank. WOW WOW WOW! Honest to goodness, this place was amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Six-word review: Freakishly delicious; not one shitty bite.Luckily I came here with friends. Friends who ate here before. Friends who ordered all three breads, 13 dishes to share, and all four desserts. Perfect for six people. Maybe perfect for one person, if your idea of a good meal is one that can be equated to the sensation of swimming in a pile of gold and yelling, ""I'm rich! I'm rich!""It was that yummy. Not a dud in the bunch. I waited many months to get in and all that melted away with the first bite of the green beans (surely you've heard about them? They must come from a crop of green beans watered with love and fed the innocence of puppies, and that's just the quality of bean, not the preparation, which will seduce you in such a manner that you must explain to someone why you look perfectly happy to have a pile of them on your lap.). And the escargot ravioli. And the scallops with duck. And the pork shank with kimchee. I could go on, but the seasonal nature of the place will probably guarantee some of these will be gone by the time you get there, replaced with other gems that will fill their shoes most generously.Go and eat. You'll spend less than you expect, including tax and tip. You'll have a great time. Just don't expect to hear your tablemates--the music is deafeningly loud. (Seriously, Izard--it's *unpleasantly* loud. Why?) But it won't matter, as you'll probably want your friends to keep their talking holes closed while you savor away."
"I went here and mentioned it to a friend of mine. Â He said, ""It's good, but it isn't THAT good."" Â I tried to clarify what he meant. Â My experience was awesome and for a really great price. Â He said, ""I mean everyone goes on and on about how great it is. Â It is great, just not THAT great.""I told him I disagreed, but whatever. Â You know a restaurant is really great when the parameters of the debate are whether it is an extraordinary experience that you will never forget or just ""great""."
"What a wonderful meal! Â I am so happy that 1-1.5 hours does not scare me in Chicago. Â In LA, that means 2-2.5 hour wait. Â Here, it seems to mean 30 minutes or less - thank you dining Gods.So, we tried to make reservations. Â Haha...there were no reservations available for 2 for weeks. Â Okay, we decided to throw our hat in the ring for some of the tables that they keep for walk-ins. Â We arrived at 5:15, and we were seated at 5:45. Â If you are going to try to come in for a table, come in early. Â The place was packed when we left.While we decided what we would have for dinner, we ordered the chicken little. Â It was bread that tasted like cream of chicken soup - divine. Â It was served with chicken liver butter - delicious and very rich - and carrot-sage oil - out of this world savory sweetness.The Girl & the Goat is a small plates restaurant. Â In addition to the bread, we ordered four small plates. Â Hubby had a couple of beers, which he loved, and I had a glass of a delicious spanish red. Â The service was excellent. Â Our waiter was very helpful in making dinner choices. Â The support staff was also amazing - very attentive and never intrusive.We started with the shaved squash and kohlrabi - a lovely salad that also had shaved fennel, shaved evalon cheese, toasted sliced almonds and ginger dressing. Â You had the onion-like goodness of the fennel, with the creaminess of the cheese, and the sweetness of the squash. Â It was heavenly - the crisp kohlrabi, toasty almonds, and ginger dressing were the icing on the cake. Â And, not the overdone icing - the dressing was light and neither too oily nor too acidic.For our next course, we ordered the chickpea fritters. Â The fritters are a blend of chickpea (both ground and hold) with cheese (I think) that are deep fried. Â They are served atop a hazlenut hummus and are topped with romesco sauce and goat cheese feta and bitter greens as well as deep fried chickpeas and raw chickpeas. Â The fritters are crisp on the outside and creamy on the inside. Â The hazlenut hummus is cool in contrast to the warm fritters. Â The raw chickpeas add a crunch while the fried chickpeas add a little spice. Â And, the romesco. Â Oh my - it was spicy and perfectly balanced.For our next dish, we had the goat, pork, and veal sugo which was reportedly flavored with rosemary and ground cherries. The sugo was served over pappardelle and was topped with quartered golden mini-tomatoes. Â The salad was my favorite but the sugo was a VERY close finish. Â Everything in this dish was so perfectly balanced. Â You could taste sweet fatty meat with a bit of woodsy goodness, but you could not isolate the individual flavors. Â Then, the tomatoes were little explosions of freshness in your mouth. Â Simply amazing.For our final dish, we had the grilled goat loin over salsify puree with goat sausage. Â This was the most disappointing dish of the evening. Â It was tasty, but it was somewhat boring. Â Goat is a very lean meat, and the salsify puree did not add much flavor. Â The goat sausage was okay, and there were some fried greens that helped. Â Although, I could have used some more greens to enhance the dish. Â I should have had the goat belly.My parents are coming to Chicago in June, and I am going to recommend that they make their reservations now. Â This restaurants was worth it!"
"First time and was not disappointed! Get the Green beans and cauliflower, pork shank, duck tongues, tuna, ham frites - we loved everything we ordered. It was a wonderful experience!"
"After the long wait, I was pretty amped to come here. Â But...honestly, it was a tad overrated. Â Don't get me wrong, the pig face was excellent. Octopus was decent, the cauliflower sucked, and the sugo was good. Â The food was brought was too fast for enjoyment (small plates in my opinion need to be brought out casually). Â The service was great, and the bread was pretty damn good. Â Anyway, I would recommend this place, but I don't think it deserves all the hype it gets."
"TOP CHEF! TOP CHEF! TOP CHEF! This place was nothing but fabulous. I LOVED the decor and intimate setting of the restaurant. The cute huge painting of the girl and goat? Eccentric with all the colors, it is definitely not your average painting. My group (5 people) had a 10PM reservation and we still had to wait 15-20 more minutes (dislike) but I patiently waited and got a drink from the overly crowded bar. Trust me if you are a short Asian girl, please ask a nice tall guy to order your drink for you because the bartender will definitely miss you. Dishes I recommend:Sauteed green beens - Holy moly I didn't know green beans could taste like that. UH-MAZING. It must be the fish sauce. chickpeas fritters - loving the goat feta and crispy fritters. yum!oysters (this was on a different menu) - so refreshing and clean taste in my mouthpig face - this is by far my FAVORITE dish. I know the name sounds disgusting but you must try this! Crispy and wonderfulness in your mouth!pork shank - meat was super tender. sauce was yummy,The ""other"" dishes - These dishes were good but not in my top...Scallops- a little too salty for me.baby octopus - this dish was a little too salty for me also. the taste was fine but nothing too special.Calamari - this was different, but I like the old style of calamari better. Overall this place has unique dishes, some of them a little saltier than others but I enjoyed everything about this place. The drinks, the atmosphere, the decor, and of course the PIG FACE. I'll be back again and hopefully not at 10PM."
"Went here last week while on business. Â I left fuming that they don't have a restaurant in Los Angeles. Â Goat belly? Â Who knew it could be so amazing. Â Other amazing dishes I tried were the pork ribs (fell off the bone), pig in a blanket bread (addictive) and the green beans (scarfed em down). Â I wish I wasn't dining alone so I could have tried more. Â On top of the amazing food, the service was awesome, the people were friendly, the venue was nice and the prices were reasonable. Can't wait to bring my wife next time I'm in Chicago."
"3.75 stars. Â I have to start out that they were easy on changing my reservation from 2 to 4 the day prior. Â That made the dining experience so much better because with 4 people, we were able to taste more dishes. Â Here is what we had:Chickpea Fritters - they were different from what I anticipated. Â They had a nice taste but I felt the flavors were underwhelming.Quinoa Ravioli - I was hoping these would be plump little suckers bursting with quinoa, but they weren't. Â These were more like wide noodles with a small baby bump. Â I couldn't tell if mine had quinoa in it but 2 people at our table could kind of taste or feel the texture of the quinoa. Â I think this was the most disappointing dish of the group. Stecca bread - Like buttery focaccia bread. Â It came with Cesar butter and garlic oil spread. Â We all liked the garlic oil spread the best. Â Very good bread.Squash Blossom Rangoon - This dish was bursting with flavors and got everyone excited. Â The issue with this dish is that is comes as 3 pieces. Â 3 pieces isn't satisfactory when there are 4 of us. Â Splitting one in half isn't the best idea as all the guts squirt out.Salmon Tartar - The salmon was the reddest salmon I have ever seen. Â It came with 3 very thin chips that couldn't hold the weight of even the tiniest amount of salmon. Â The taste was fine but the salmon wasn't as flavorful as the buttery salmon sashimi from Tampopo and the tartar aspect of it couldn't compare to Rise's tuna tartar.Octopus - This was more of a salad as it was a bowl filled with crisp, fresh green vegetables, rather than octopus. Â Fresh and flavorful but limited on the pieces of octopus.Shirt Steak - This is probably the second most disappointing dish. Â The caramel goat cheese sauce over it was an interesting twist but it wasn't worth the underwhelming steak.Chicken - This came more as an entrÃ©e size and we were happy about that. Â The seasoning on the chicken gave the flavor a step up. Â Accompanying it was buttered and grilled pita wedges, fried pickles and 2 different dipping sauces. Â I think we were supposed to combine all of those together for the perfect bite but that didn't happen as the pickles got scarfed up as soon as they hit the table.Pork Face - Just as delicious as everyone mentions. Â It comes with a sunnyside egg on top and once the dish comes, you are supposed to mash it up all together. Â Doing so made it resemble and taste close to a hash.Goat belly - Leaner than pork belly with some nice crispy edges. Â We all really enjoyed this however the piece was very small. Â 4 of us had to equally cut up the 3 inch by half inch serving.All of this plus a bottle of wine came out to be around $210. Â As for the ambiance, it was ok. Â It wasn't formal as it kept its West Loop vibe. Â The servers wore t-shirts, jeans and sneakers. Â Patrons dressed almost as casual. Â The service was casual but good. Â The food came out a tad faster than I expected and the first round was overwhelming as they brought out 4 dishes at once. Â I felt that should have been spaced out better and have no more than 2 dishes out at once. Â I would probably eat here again as a group of 4 again because paying about $55 a person is a good value; however the wait for a reservation is daunting."
"So wow, I'm still full from my meal at GATG last night. The waiter suggested that we order about 2 plates per person. That might have been a few plates too many. But my 5 girlfriends and I did our best to finish everything! It was hard not to because the food was so tasty and decadent.We started off with some cocktails and I heard that the Best of Three was really good. It had Pimm's so I don't know how it could be bad! We then ordered the squish squash bread and another warm bread with a garlic parsley sauce. They were warm, fresh, and delicious.Now let's get into the juicy stuff. We had:Roasted beets (green beans, white anchovy, avocado creme fraiche)Roasted cauliflower (pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint)Kabocha squash ravioli (mushroom raisin ragout, brussels leaves, shroom creme fraiche)Grilled baby octopus (guanciale, lemon-pistachio vinaigrette)Seared scallopsSeafood fideosSkirt steak a la planca (chiogga beets, house pickles, wilted romaine, salted goat milk caramel)Wood oven roasted pig face (sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, potato stix)Walter's chickenI think that's it! Too much!!! But my faves were the seafood fideos and pig face. Although the fideos was VERY VERY salty, I loved the strong flavor and the seafood (mussels, clams, shrimp) were so big and abundant. The sauce was like heaven on my tongue. It probably could use less salt, but I don't care! The pig face was like pure fat and I could feel it clogging my arteries. And yet, I couldn't stop eating it. We ordered a couple of bottles of the Klee Pinot Noir which paired perfectly with all of these heavy dishes.The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because it is slightly overpriced. I know it has the Top Chef name behind it so I expected to pay a lot. But that doesn't mean I have to LIKE paying that much. We did have a very nice waiter who was clearly very knowledgeable about the menu (although he could have warned my vegetarian friend not to order the beets with anchovy because she must not have seen that little detail on the menu). We got to meet Stephanie Izard at the end and she was really friendly and cool! Even got to discuss Richard Blaise's chances of winning Top Chef Masters in a few weeks! He'll always be number 2, though!Anyway, I would go back to GATG if someone else is paying. But I gotta save up some cash otherwise!"
"Loved everything about this place; the food, the drinks, the atmosphere, the service - all of it top notch. We had a fantastic server, Gerson, who friendly, fun, helpful, attentive and guided us through the experience. We had ghums n' roses bread, roasted cauliflower, goat empanadas, pig face, and pork shank. So, so yummy! We ended the evening with the miso-butterscotch budino for dessert as recommended by Gerson and it was great! We will definitely go back, I want to try the halibut as well as many veggie dishes I was eyeing on other tables. Also, if I ever go with a party of 6 or more, I definitely want to try the goat leg. A table of four nearby got the goat leg, which I understand they only serve a couple a night, and it looked amazing! And they had so much still for delicious leftovers!!!!"
I usually have a hard time believing the hype but here's a place worth dropping some hard earned dollars. I left the choices up to the waiter and walked away impressed. I'll try it again before the year is up just to see if I can repeat the experience.
"I think I'm in love with this restaurant! I have patiently waited since November to eat here (yes, I had to make a reservation in November in order to eat here at the end of February - unless you want to eat at 4pm or 10pm of course....). At 6pm on a MONDAY, the place was fully packed - seriously - a Monday?? I was a bit concerned that I would be expecting too much after all of the phenomenal reviews and that I would be disappointed (that always happens with movies, doesn't it??). In any case, I was definitely not disappointed. From the moment we walked in the door, the service was exceptional. The valet even went back to my friend's car to retrieve a cell phone and bring it in to the restaurant. We had to wait about 5 minutes, but we were 15 min early for our reservation, so we were well accommodated. The room is fantastic. There are a variety of tables in little areas. We had a small-ish two seater, but there was a bit communal table and a bar seating, and larger tables intermixed. While the restaurant was loud overall, the seating is such that you can have an actual conversation with your dining companion. The room is so cozy and comfortable. The dark wood with interesting lighting and the open kitchen really make it a homey atmosphere. I really loved the space - I could have stayed there all evening. Service was impeccable - on par with service at Tru/Everest/etc. Our water glasses never went empty (literally - not for even a second). The server was knowledgeable and helpful. What was especially nice, though, was that even though the restaurant was packed, we weren't rushed through and service was at a nice pace. On to the food....simply delicious. We tried two of the breads (the one with nuts - Y.U.M!), the crispy chickpeas (oh - sooo good), pizza (I really liked it, my friend didn't. it has a strong flavor which I liked, but it was a bit spicy as well and the yogurt sauce really cuts the spiciness), papardelle pasta (I don't know what was in there, but it was divine!), lamb stuffed calamari (perfect), skirt steak (quite good, with an interesting caramel sauce). I didn't try dessert because I was completely stuffed, but all of the desserts were finished by the tables next to us in about 3 seconds flat. Oh - my one comment would be - don't order as much as they tell you - I could have eaten one of the small plates as my meal (ok, maybe two), but it was nice to try a lot of the menu items. The wine list was a nice combination of interesting pours and they have quite the cocktail selection. I don't know how else to express how fabulous this meal was - but I can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu (well, maybe not the crispy pig face...I just don't know if I could do that, though I'm sure it's delicious!). Oh - we got buttons when we paid to vote for Stephanie for best chef. VOTE!"
"The Girl & the Goat falls just short of perfect - great service, great food, great aesthetics - except for the extreme noise. Â We went there last night as a party of 4 for my husband's birthday celebration (we made reservations). Â Our food was amazing. Â We had the pork belly & fish, kohlrabi salad, warm olives, kalbi ribs, pig face, goat carpaccio, and salmon. Â Since it was my husband's birthday the server brought us an amazing dessert that he said was his favorite that involved cashews (which I normally hate) and bacon brittle. Â It was sooo good. Â Really if we hadn't had to shout at each other all night, it would have been perfect. Â As my husband said, ""it's another Randolph Street shout fest."" Â It's not that the music is too loud, it's just that the restaurant is full and no attempt has been made to mitigate the sounds of that many people talking around hard surfaces."
"Luck can serve well for those wanting to dine at Girl & The Goat with no reservation. I've been at Girl & The Goat twice, once with no reservation, and the other with areservation made a week prior to arrival. Showing up around 4:30, you will more than likely be able to grab a seat at the commune table, even so, during our second meal with the reservation, we noticed many couples walking in and being seated--that is if you don't mind eating with 4 other people. One of the best meals I've ever had. Girl & the Goat is a dining euphoria for those with and without a strong palette. The staff will live beyond the expectation of their tip, giving endless suggestions without being over-compensating, and always describing your dish before you dig in. They are much more down to earth than many other hyped-up Chicago restaurant's staff tend to be. Chickpea fritter must be experienced. It would be a shame not to reward your palette with this amazingly thought out dish. Having ordered the roasted cauliflower twice, I appreciated the balance of flavors more the first time as the mint was a tad over excessive the second time. Order the sticky date cake if still available on the menu. Never will another dessert have such orgasmic flavors than this beautifully crafted ending dish. If you're lucky you may get to see Stephanie Izard approving dishes before they are set out; we saw her our first visit, however she was MIA the second time around. Don't let the lack of reservation discourage you from trying this place--it is more than easy enough to slip in with an hour or two wait. Don't leave Chicago without trying."
"My husband took me here for my birthday yesterday and To sum the meal up, I'd have to say this was one of the best meals I've ever eaten. Our server, Hunter, was awesome. He helped guide us through the menu and when we asked for his recommendations, they helped seal the deal on our choices. Â We started with the kohlrabi salad which I could have eaten the entire bowl. It contained mandolin sliced apples, mixed greens, kalamata olives and of course the star of the show, sliced kohlrabi. This was tossed in a delicious dressing that was slightly creamy. We also ordered the goat empanadas, which were delicious. Not over fried and greasy, but nicely fried so that you could really taste the goat.Next came the diver scallops. These were our second favorite dish of the night. The sear on these scallops was superb. Â The accompaniments were also great, we both spooned a good deal of the sauce on our plates.The goat loin came next and this was our favorite dish of the night. Â The goat was perfectly cooked. Â Very tender. Sliced, roasted brussel sprouts, mandolin sliced apples, crumbled goat chorizo and a delicious sauce came in the same dish. Finally, we got the pig face. Â This was good. Crunchy, porky goodness. Â We ordered the bittersweet chocolate dessert that came with a shittake gelato. Part of me was skeptical about mushroom ice cream, but once I tried it, it was the perfect balance to the dessert. Definitely not too mushroomy. Â Not too rich, just rich enough if that makes sense. We polished that dessert off. Â Our server also brought us a pumpkin pie dessert that was also very good.Overall, this was an awesome meal, fantastic music (James Brown, the Police, Jay-Z, Notorious BIG, Eric Clapton), and wonderful service. Â I hope to dine here again soon!,"
"Was the 3 month waiting list for a reservation worth it? Â I'd say so. Â After enjoying a couple ""Best of Three"" cocktails we noshed on about 8 small plates for our group of 4. Â Our top pics were:*Sauteed green beans in fish sauce*Wood oven roasted pig face*Wood fired walter's chicken The staff was great. They comped us a couple of small plates and desserts to make up for our 20 minute seating delay, however, the server himself was a bit peculiar.All in all, I'd recommend this spot."
This was our second seating at Girl & the Goat. It was a great experience from start to finish. We tried some new items this time. The wood fire Wiley point oysters and the goat liver pate with hot crumpets are a must! The savory breads should not be missed either as they are fresh baked and delish. The best part is you can go across the way to the bakery and purchase some to bring home to enjoy! The most impressive thing about this place is the wonderful food pairings - for instance crispy duck tongue with tuna and black bean poke or roasted cauliflower with pine nuts & mint. These are things a home cook would never think to put together and they are so good! The scallops cooked to perfection in a wonderful smoked uni cream will keep you coming back for sure! This is a must go for all foodies and there is plenty of options for the non-foodies as well. Try it - you will definitely like it!
"Totally lived up to expectations.Was my first visit, walked in on a Thursday and was able to get a table no problem.Would def. rec. the pig face even though it sounds crazy."
"I used to love g&g but more recently the food and service has definitely gone down in quality. My friend and I both thought the dishes in general were overly salty and when we brought this to the waitress' attention, she began to argue with us. It's too bad, but I doubt I'll bother going back for a while ESP when there are so many other amazing restaurants to try in the area."
"I really really wanted to love this place. Besides being a fan of Top Chef, I had watched Top Chef when Stephanie Izard won. Â I love lists and the fact that this restaurant was always on the top Chicago lists made it even more alluring to come. Â Of course I had to make reservations months in advance. Â The restaurant was nice and the service was good. Â Now either I have a eclectic palate so the uniqueness of some of the dishes wasn't really as new to me. Â I agree with everyone that the roasted cauliflower was good. Â But then the rest was ok if not below ok. Â Our scallops were salty, goat shank was just fine but not innovative, and overall food was fine. Â I was disappointed and expected so much more and got so much less. Â A lot of people thought that maybe my expectations were too high but even given that I don't think the food was anything special."
"I went with two friends on a Tuesday night at 6:30 p.m. When we arrived the place was bustling. It wasn't quite pack at the time, most people were in the bar area, but shortly after we sat down it was hard to tell if any seats were open.We made our reservation about two months out, but it should be noted we weren't trying to get the first available reservation, it was more what worked for our calendars. I've heard a few people complain about how far out you have to make the reservation, I can't really speak to that.Service was great.What we had:Spence wheat breadWood grilled broccoliChickpea frittersDiver scallopsTempura trout filetHam fritesWood oven roasted pig faceGrilled confit duck legEverything was good. Nothing disappointed. I'm not really into chickpeas, but they were executed well. I mean, they were fried so. This is the first time I've had grilled broccoli and you should too. Consider adding it to your summer grilling menu.The scallops were perfectly prepared, seared and had just the right touch of sweetness. Our waitress noted the trout and that it was their take on sweet and sour chicken. We all agreed that it wasn't quite that, but was good in it's own right.The ham frites were the best fries I've had that weren't cooked in truffle oil. They were fries with a dusting of ham and they were delicious.Before going I told a friend, ""You can't put pig face on a menu and expect me not to order it."" I, unlike most, prefer this dish presented in the same way it appears in your mind as you think about it. Here, it came sliced and under a sunny-side up egg. Instructions were to chop it all up, mix it together and enjoy. That's exactly what we did. Mmmmmm.Now the duck was something we noticed, but only ordered at the urging of our waitress. Simply put the duck stole the show. There was a lot going on with that plate, but it all worked together, from the pomegranates to the mushrooms to the fall off the bone duck leg. A definite must!For dessert, my friends had something that was supposed to be like a Moscato. From the reviews, I think it missed the mark. They also had the pumpkin pie gelato. If I could put into word the smile it brought to their faces, I would. Unfortunately, I'm not that gifted. I had a pretty standard tawny - good stuff.To sum it up, you NEED to go. Order with an open mind, soak in the ambiance and appreciate what's happening - goodness."
"We had a super late reservation 11:15pm and I think after a day of being tourists we were a little tired to do more than just partake in the delectable delights. The look of the place is dark and modern and they were playing Florence + the Machine when we arrived. The kitchen is open to but as my back was to the main dining room I didn't have a view of much besides my dining companions. Our waitress was top notch. I wish I could remember her name!Let's get down to the food served in sharable plates. Nothing disappointed. We shared the Squishy bread (?) with pecan butter and apple sauce. The butter was delicious so what's not to like?We continued on with the Fennel salad - just the right mix of flavours and crunch though I had to redefine what I thought fennel was or else I didn't get any. Then there were scallops with pomegranate - I'm told it was gorgeous as was the snail ravioli. The words used here were ""buttery"".The ""main"" or biggest share was the pork shank. It was huge and all roasted and crisp n the outside and fall of the bone in the middle. It was served with sauces and baked fluffy pita type bread and some peeled veg but I can't remember what. It was just all so yummy to eat!We shared dessert - a spiced cake with pumpkin? gelato and crunchy stuff. It was described as tasting like ""fall in your mouth"". I will be back next time I'm in the windy city ;)"
"the food is pretty amazing, def get the pig face, but i would recommend you getting this dish before everything else (since it is quite heavy) we couldn't finish it because we had so much food.likes:Pig faceshishito pepperswalter's chickenwould not order again:escargot ravioli (the only way you can eat these babies are just simple garlic and parsley)confit goat belly (it has crab meat in it, it was not a good combo)"
I wanted to update my review and bump it up to five stars because after my visit last weekend I was blown away. I have always been curious about frog legs but have never taken a chance on them until I tried them here and I was so glad I let the ones at Girl & the Goat be my first. Heaven...with strawberries. I may never look at a frog without licking my lips again. This entire meal was perfect. From the drinks to the bread to the ribs and the incredible sugo. Dinner does not get much better than this.
"As the top-rated Yelp restaurant in Chicago and the restaurant of Stephanie Izard, winner of Top Chef Season 4 (and the only woman to win Top Chef so far), Girl and the Goat is a restaurant that I HAD to try.I came right when it opened and it was already packed. I sat at the bar and instantly made friends with the people around me, and we started sharing all of our food together. Our waitress loved the fact that we were all sharing, so she offered the roasted cauliflower dish on the house! It was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had, simply because the food brought people together (and the food was DELICIOUS). Everything here is amazing: it's inventive, perfectly executed, and very reasonably-priced for the outstanding quality. Below is a list of what I had. My favorites were the roasted cauliflower, wood grilled broccoli, chickpea fritters, wood oven roasted pig face. -Spence wheat with peanut butter, blackberry honey-Goat liver mousse w pickled rhubarb, blackberry mustarda, crumpets-Goat carpaccio with tongue olive vinaigrette and smoked roe-Sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews-Pan fried shishito peppers with parmesan, sesame, miso-Roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint-Kohlrabi salad with fennel, evalon bluberries, toasted almonds, ginger dressing-Wood grilled broccoli with rogue smokey bleu and spiced crispies-Chickpea fritters stewed and fresh chickpeas with pickled onions, caponata, crave brother's mozzarella-Diver scallops braised duck marcona, almond butter, green papaya, green almond nuoc cham-Pinn oaks lamb tartare english pea tapenade tuna aioli water crackers-Wood oven roasted piig face sunny side egg tamarind cilanmtro red wine-maple potato stix-Broken arrow ranch quail maitake blackberry asparagus-gordal tapenade-Goat cheesecake hazelnut runch candied beets cajetaExcellent service, great decor. Perfect place for a date, group of friends, parents, anyone! Girl and the Goat sets the bar high for all small plate restaurants. I just wish other restaurants could be both as good and reasonably-priced as this one! I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Chicago!"
"I've been here 5-6 times now, and this is hands down my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Â Everything is amazing! Â My all-time favorite dishes include the pig face, the crudo, and the scallops (recently changed the recipe and it's still the most awesomest thing ever). Â We recently tried the goat belly on the specials list and that was amazing too. Â Even the vegetable dishes are amazing, and I don't even like vegetables! Â My fiancee's personal favorite is the cauliflower...can you believe that? Â Cauliflower! Â And even I have to agree it's so good! Â I like to take out-of-towners here too. Â My cousin, who is a major foodie from NYC, gave it 2 thumbs way up like Siskel and Ebert style. Â I took my brother here when he was buzzed and all he wanted to do was drink more, and he actually had to stop drinking in order to eat the amazing food, because it's just that good.The atmosphere is great. Â The service is pretty casual and relaxed, yet always friendly and very attentive. Â A little advice: Â if you don't mind eating late, you can pretty much always get a table here any day of the week after 9pm (weekdays are slightly easier, obviously). Â Open Table pretty much never has room for reservations, but if you just walk in late you can almost always get a table within a half hour or so. Â Get a drink at the bar, enjoy the awesome atmosphere that this place has to offer and in no time you'll be dining in one of the finest establishments in Chicago!"
"o! m! g! this is the best food i've had a in a long time. we ordered five vegan dishes and each one was insane. such amazing, tasty flavor combinations. my four meat eating friends LOVED all the dishes. they were even able to squeeze us in despite no reservations available...so don't be discouraged if you can't reserve. there's also the lounge and patio, too.i wish they had an nyc location! yum!"
"It's OK. Â And that's pretty much it. Â I'll sum the food up: Â go buy a bunch of awesome ingredients, close your eyes, throw them in a frying pan and add a bunch of butter, salt and rich meat, serve. Â Repeat. Â The dishes were not well-conceived in my opinion, pretty much just an oily, salty Hodge-podge of flavors. Â I think the One-Off guys do a better job."
"Not sure what I can add to the 2300+ great reviews they already have. Â But, this is what a new restaurant is all about. Â They do what they do great... I absolutely loved the place. Â Girl & The Goat is so good, I wish I could give it 7 stars. Â And if you don't know, Pig Face... NOM NOM NOM. Â  And the cocktails are great, I had a barrel aged Martinez, very good."
Girl & The Goat is our favorite Chicago restaurant Â  We come in from Â New York about five times a year. We always have a great meal. Last night we had our best experience ever. We had the best server ever. Alison G. made an incredible dinner even better. She anticipated our needs and helped me have a wonderful. Birthday diner. Her great smile and the great freshly prepared food will not soon be Forgotten.
"Chicago is a seriously underrated foodie town. More people should know about the amazing restaurants and food coming out of this city. A friend and I decided to visit another friend living in Chicago, and we wanted to do a nice dinner one of the nights. On our flight over, the woman next to us recommended this place. Our Chicago friend's friend recommended this place also. We called the day before and the earliest reservation they had was 10pm the next night. We took it. Everything was seriously amazing - we had a vegetarian with us, so we mixed up meat dishes and veggie dishes for a nice variety. I love meat, but the veggie dishes were REALLY good also. Everything was delicious, including the bread served with some kind of butter with a ginger kick to it.Next time I'm in Chicago, I'm definitely coming back here."
"We had a very nice meal at Girl and the Goat over Memorial Day weekend. The food was well done, the service was top-notch, and the experience overall was a positive one.We waited two months for a reservation at Girl and the Goat, but our waitress told us that you can typically get a same-night table without too much of a wait if you arrive at the restaurant early (before 5:00 p.m.) or late (after 9:30 p.m.). There's plenty of street parking in the area so don't worry about finding a spot.Once inside, we were seated at a table near the bar/kitchen, which ended up working to our advantage as there was a very polite couple who offered us a bit of their pan fried shishito peppers which surprised me. The parmesan added nice texture and the miso gave the peppers an interesting taste.I selected the esteban fresas for my starter - essentially bread with strawberry butter and a strawberry/rhubarb jam - and thought it was wonderful. I expected the strawberries and rhubarb to be a bit too sweet for my tastes, but they were expertly paired. Served with piping hot bread, it made for a very nice summer appetizer.My boyfriend and I shared the giant Cortes Island oysters and they were truly great. They were paired with a soy sauce and cucumber that provided diversity and a bit of spice. And the oysters themselves were gigantic. I would highly recommend the dish.The halibut with brandade was a slight disappointment simply because it was nothing I couldn't get elsewhere. It wasn't bad, but it certainly wasn't outstanding either.When it came to dessert we chose the rhubarb n' lemon, which again, I thought was very nice. The graham cracker was quite crumbly, but the panna cotta was delicious. Again, another hit.What really stood out at Girl & the Goat was the service. Our waitress was absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend can't stomach butter - there's something about the texture and taste of it that makes him ill - and she made sure that everyone working on or serving our meal knew about his issue. She double checked every ingredient with the chef and as a result we had a completely painless evening. Our waitress was also very friendly and polite. I rarely come across such wonderful service."
"I went with my husband when Girl & the Goat was pretty new, only a month or two open, so it definitely had it's things to test and iron out. Â I hear people say they really like the dishes they got and go on and on, but honestly for a Top Chef, nothing that new or special (to me). I was not in love unfortunately and I really wanted to be!There were a couple things we really liked and couple that were OK, but for the price and all the hype....was not impressed. I do want to go back and try it again, give it another chance now that it's been open longer and hopefully it's gotten into a groove. I think one of the problems, the menu is too big, hence the only OK dishes. I think Stephanie really should focus on a smaller choice and hone in on GREAT dishes!Also, my husband and I were both turned off from the beginning on the way they handled the whole ""hair in our food"" situation. They pretty much didn't handle it at all and I felt like they were implying the hair was mine (b/c it happen to look like mine), but I literally pulled the hair out or our bread. shivers! Â It wasn't sitting on top, it was IN! They gave no apologies, did not take the item off the bill and took forever to replace it and it was just bread and yes you have to pay for their ""special breads"" there. Rolling my eyes.And the whole I call it ""Urban Barn"" motif, unfortunately in Chicago is already getting old. It's cool looking, but the trend is losing it's flair already. I can name a few others with the same atmosphere...Ruxbin (which I love, top of my list, The Purple Pig (another good one!) and Balana...this trend is now over done for new restaurants.I was a big fan of Chef Stephanie during the show, but after going to her restaurant, she lost me :( Â  Sad because I was really rooting for you S!"
"So one time in band camp I saw this girl on tv and she could really, really cook and in my mind I became her friend.And so one time in band camp I stuck a pig face in my mouth and I loved it.Stephanie and I spent a lot of time at band camp(not really) growing learning how to love and be loved. I have to say she learned a lot more than I.Pig face, yeah, I love it.Green beans, I could write you a sonnet if I were, and I am not, more eloquent.Eat Me they said, and I did.This is the first meal in a while where I felt that I was Really, yes Really paying for a Â meal that I could not have duplicated or had the bastard of, somewhere else. We ate 8 things, all were excellent, some exceptional.Eat the friggin green Beans I'm not playin y'all.Lotsa love Stephanie, Peace out.P to the SI am never star stuck... ask gwenyth and Â brad, and I had to hold out the urge to bum rush Stephanie for a picture with me while she was expediting our delicious meal.All the love. You gave Besh's tasting a run for the money!"
"Again, a solid 4 star experience. Â The service was great and the atmosphere remained the same. Â Trendy and comfortable. Â Our party of four ordered the:Wheat bread with butter with peanuts and honey spread - YUM. Â Classic yet delicious.Raw Oysters - From what I heard, they were very very good.Ham Frites - I wanted to give these a second shot. Â I'm glad I did. Â We were able to ""snack"" on these rather than try to eat them. Â They were perfectly cooked.Sauteed Green Beans - I'm not sure why we ordered these again. Â Way too much fish sauce.Roasted Cauliflower - Good. Simple. Â The mint was a bit weird.Hiramasa Crudo - Divine. Â Loved the crisp flavors.Steamed Clams - Excellent. Â A tad salty but the Chinese Cruller made up for it.Kalbi Style Beef Ribs - You can get better kalbi at a Korean restaurant. Â Disappointed. Â Pig Face - Still enjoyed.Grilled Pork Ribs - Tasty but nothing extraordinary.Apples and Peaches with Goat Cheese Gelato - Very good. Â A perfect end.I'll always enjoy coming here. Â But I might wait a bit longer to try some new menu items."
"Obviously this place was hyped, but the food was just not good. Â The atmosphere was incredibly loud, and the tables were very tight (it felt like we were at the same table as our neighbors). Â As a Top Chef fan, I wanted to like this place, but I really didn't enjoy even a bite. Â The service was ok, so I gave them a second star."
"There is a part of me that wishes that I didn't hear a lick about this place - because I didn't want the hype to sway the overall experience. Â I can describe the design space as comfy modern industrial chic loft - burnt lacquered wood walls painted black, french bistro chairs, reclaimed wood coffee table, modern comfy bar booth. Â Sounds of the kitchen, the pretty people, and the occasional hip hop cut fill the space.The service was excellent - hostesses were friendly, bar staff accommodating, my water glass was always never empty, and the waiter gave recommendations like a pal. Â We were advised to order about 5 dishes for 2 people.Each dish was executed like a champ.Chick Pea Fritters - crunchy outside with a gooey middleCrisp Soft Shell Crab over a bed of Sweet Corn Fish Sauce & Cashew Green Beans - salty and nuttyGoat Ribs - carmelized edges, while the meat fell off the bone - sauces soaked up by a side of the soft bloody mary breadPig Face - THE SUCCULENT TRUTH.After enjoying what was the best meal I've had in a really long time, much to my surprise, once the bill came - I wasn't floored by sticker shock(as most hyped restaurants usually come with).It has been a really long time where I've enjoyed a restaurant experience through and through. There's a part of me that wants to give it a crappy review just so I can hopefully get a table sooner. Â =) Â But I must give credit when it is due - well done, Girl. Â The Goat was FIRE."
"This is hands down my favorite restaurant. Yes, you do have to make reservations four months in advance and may have to settle on an earlier or later than usual dinner time, but it is definitely worth it. Although I'm a meticulously picky eater, I have tried a variety of dishes here, and each one has been well above satisfactory. The food is savory and delicious. Also, I've found the service to be superb. The waitstaff are friendly, relaxed and engaging."
"Can't believe I haven't reviewed Girl & the Goat after all the dozens of times I have eaten here over the past couple years. It's worth getting reservations in advance. Best green beans in the world.I'm a carnivore, but this has to be the only restaurant that the veggies consistently outshine the meats. The meats are wonderful, but every vegetable I order is consistently beyond amazing. Love their breads (always order every one of them) too. Only weak link I see is the dessert menu. I'm never too impressed... which is fine because I'm usually stuffed by the delicious meal."
"Just when I thought Stephanie couldn't do it any better than a scrumptious dinner at Girl & The Goat, she goes ahead and puts up an incredible Super Bowl Sunday brunch.We started off with the crumpets, which after trying them at Owen & Engine, I was definitely in the mood for good crumpets. The crumpets were very good, the kumquats were a nice touch and the maple syrup soaked deeply into these fluffy (although not quite traditional) pastries. The goat chili was the highlight of the meal. Pulled pork style shredded goat with hummus, chick peas, and goat cheese. This was a chili for people who are tired of the typical ground beef and bean chili. Wonderfully imaginative and a sour bite at the end, this was a chili to die for!!We also ordered the oyster po' boy. This had the word 'yum' written all over it. Large fried oysters, cole slaw and a fried egg on a french roll. Again, not traditional New Orleans style, but damn good. Overall this was a fantastic brunch and you can't beat the $10 bloody mary + PBR. What a fantastic way to start off your Super Bowl festivities. Let's do it again next year!"
"We had reservations at 4:45 on a Thursday. Â Place was already packed at that time. Â I read many other reviews prior to coming here. Â The drinks and food here are excellent.There was 2 of us and we had to drink the agave fleur and the best of three drinks. Â They were very refreshing and yummy. Â We also started with the stecca bread which was very good but the top of the bread was a little to tough to bite into. Â We then had the squash blossom which had to be our favorite dish.. Â The waiter then brought out the confit goat belly which was just as delicious. Â Also, we tried the green beans and the much raved about pig face. Â Both were very good as well. Â I loved the hip vibe of the place. Â I can't wait to come back and try other items as well. Â I would highly recommend this place."
"I make it a point to dine at Girl & the Goat every time I am in Chicago. The staff is just awesome and very helpful in providing suggestions for drinks and food. I love the ""small plates"" concept and usually stick to two to three dishes which is ample. Along with the meat and seafood dishes, the vegetarian options are quite solid as well and I appreciate the fact that apart from a few top sellers, the menu changes frequently. The bar features a good selection of bourbons which is a definite plus."
Green beans. Â Get them. Â Get two orders. You can thank me later.
"A must-go restaurant, if you can get in! Make reservations. Be prepared for a dining experience. Try new things. The fish dish was my favorite but honestly everything was fantastic. Totally gourmet!"
"Definitely a great spot, a bit pricey, but good! Â Plenty of goat options..."
"For the price and the hype I was disappointed overall, though I have to say that some of the items were crazy good like the pig stomach and lobster thing. Â Other items were just so-so. Â I do have to say that i thought the prices were actually lower than i expected, with most small plates in the $15 range. Â This is a tapas style restaurant where you order 10 or so plates for a table of four. Â The service at our table was 5 stars and they even brought us several additional plates compliments of the chef. Â However, the waitress at the bar area added an extra $25 to her tip (which I caught and the hotel corrected). Â Great high end, stylish atmosphere good for a date or getting together with friends. Â Somewhat noisy which can be fun with a group or anoying depending on your mood.Would I die to go back there again next time I am in Chicago, with all of the other great restaurants there? Â Probably Not.I would give this place 4 stars for the food, but am only giving them 2 stars, since the waitress tried to rip me off by adding $25 to her already 17% tip."
"Unfortunately, while agreeing all the concept the chef had, I think the food is not as fancy as it sounds. Love the concept, organic looking, fresh food, upscale in style yet not showy. The business adopted a smart idea and it is to let the crowded bar area to speak for itself. The service, super good, I love the style of the servers, almost feel going back to Los Angeles. We did walk in, and we were seated rather quick as it is just after 4:30pm the open time. Â The food is not exceptional , not close. The roasted veggie is great dish ( broccoli or cauliflower ), the goat capaccio is fresh, rib was ok but not special. I will definitely return. My friend does not eat goat so it really limited our choices given it is goat shop."
"OOF! UGH! UHM! OUCH!That's the sound of me writhing in pain from eating far too much deliciousness at Girl and the Goat tonight. Went to a nice dinner with my mom before we pack me up to move me out of Chicago for good. Amazing meal!Finished 3 hours ago and I'm still. so. full.Started off with warm wheat bread with peanut butter, banana, and bacon butter (tasted like the best peanut butter banana sandwich possible) and a side of the most delectable honey comb I might have ever tasted. Smooth, sweet, and rich. I called the waitress over to ask where they got such a wonderful treat. Apparently it's from a beekeeper in northern Illinois. Yay, local honey!Also: a glass of the Girl and the Goat white wine. Nice.Next course was a honeycrisp soup with brown butter and tarragon yogurt. So creamy and delicious! Started off with a bit of a sweet touch but ended VERY sour/tart. You feel it in the back of your throat in the best way possible. The special: scallops with crispy pork belly. The scallops were soft and thinly sliced with an acidic bite. Pork belly was a bit sour as well with some sweet undertones. Great!Then the pan roasted redfish with black beans, squash, and hen of the woods mushrooms. Oh emz. Those mushrooms mean serious business. Now, they're no chanterelles (my favorite fungai of all time) but they're a damn good mushroom. The fish was perfectly cooked and crispy on the outside, soft and moist inside. The squash was nice and firm. I think there was a little bok chyi in there as well. The sauce had a bit of a spicy bite to it but nothing major. This might have been my favorite course (next to the honey, natch). Goat, pork and veal sugo with pappardelle and goose berries. Amazing! The slow cooked shredded meats were soft and succulent, the pappardelle was perfectly cooked and flavorful, the gooseberries lent a wonderful sweet touch to the dish. So excellent but we were paining and could not finish. *sniff sniff*The so attentive and helpful waitress came around and asked us if we wanted dessert. I couldn't. I just...couldn't. Heartbreak. But I did ask to see the menu to see what I was missing. The cocoa nib doughnuts? Oh, why did we split 5 dishes?! *double sniff sniff*The space is beautiful. Rustic tables, dark interior, the wonderful aroma of a wood burning stove wafting through the space. Tables close enough together so you can inspect what the folks next to you ordered (and wonder if you should go with that too). Did I mention the wood burning stove smell? And it's warm glow? So cozy!At first I thought the portions were a bit small for my mom and I to share but I was silly for worrying. 5 courses shared and we're still in pain. Delicious, delicious pain. The perfect place for my ""adios, Chicago!"" fancy dinner! And the likely place I'll hit up when I come to town for visits. This time I'll save room for those doughnuts!"
"Clearly this place doesn't need another review, but being the flawed human I am, I wanted to write a review simply so the Yelp world will know I've joined the ranks of super classy food-loving individuals. Â A foodie notch on my belt, if you will.It's gonna be quick and dirty folks:Tuesday night 830 reservation (booked two months prior).I wore a simple dress and super kickin' heels.He wore...lets face it-doesn't matter what he wore...I had the tequila drink from the cocktail menu, on recommendation from a friend-and she wasn't wrong-if I wasn't such a sissy, pansy girl of a drinker, I'd have had more than one. Â And that's saying a lot for tequila, people.Pretzel Bread: AMAZING. Â The 1000 Island served with it was good but it was much better with the fancy butter.Shrimp Ceviche: AMAZING. Â I don't really like shrimp and I could have eaten this all night long.Scallops w/Duck: AMAZING. Â The most tender, fall apart in your mouth scallops the world has ever seen. Â And the only duck I've ever wanted more of.Goat Cheese Tortellini: AMAZING. Â Pasta was so tender and the goat cheese filling was plentiful but not overpoweringly goaty.Roasted Cauliflower: AMAZING. Â If my mom served this growing up I might have considered going vegetarian. Â Pork Shank: Â AMAZING. Â Served with pita to make your own mini sandwich bites. Â Honestly, so full by this point I only had one bite, but it was heavenly. Â Didn't do dessert (GASP!!!) there were simply too many great savory options and we left incredibly full PLUS had a bag of leftovers.Service was...you guessed it...AMAZING. Â Atmosphere was great, though at first I thought it was going to be far too loud to be enjoyable; however, we were able to have great conversation without having to yell across the table or feel like the next table was listening in.Server told us they are opening a bread shop across the street, and I tell ya-I'll be stopping in frequently for that pretzel bread...If you haven't already stopped reading my review to make reservations, do so now...I'll wait...Enjoy! Â You won't regret it (but then again, I didn't get a look at the bill...lucky to be dating such a gentleman...)"
"Imma keep it real for everybody. D.A.M.N. That pretty much sums it up. So much so that I'm willing to overlook the ludicrous music level. Seriously, once their food enters your mouth, all you really hear is the orgasmic sounds of your body craving more...and more...and more. Until you you realize that it's all gone. But then....there is still a dessert menu.So what makes this establishment an flawless substituion for sex? Well, damn near everything. What I ate (and if you're going, go with as large of a group as possible. Each person should order 1-2 items and EVERYONE should share. Do it. Trust me.):QuailPork ShankScallopsEscargot RavioliGreen BeansRoasted CauliflowerRoasted Beet SaladGrilled Baby OctopusHam FritesBeef Tonguewhatever three bread types that had that day....and then dessert...chocolate cakegoat cheesecakered tea bruleequatro lechesI'm full just thinking about it. And now I'm jealous of myself for having such great food...and such great company to share it all with...and such great food...and the drinks aren't too shabby...and such great food........and then dessert...I hope you're reading this while on the phone to make a reservation. Oh, a little insiders tip for the ladies...the bathrooms are downstairs and (as only a women will understand) the stairs to get there are EXTREMELY high-heel friendly. So, feel free to pull out the killer pumps. Fo' Sho'"
"Really really good and reasonably priced. They serve smaller plates designed to be shared. Â Sarah and I shared 5 plates and a desert. Â We had:- Locally cultured butter and beer cheese with bread- Chickpea with mixed veggies: Really good. Â Looked like tofu.- Squash crab ragoon: Lightly fried and wrapped in squash instead of dough.- Pig Face: So, so so good! Â  It looked just like a patty of meat, but tasted like tender, smokey bacon/pulled pork awesomeness.- Chicken with fried pickles: Was very good, but not quite as good as the previous items.- Goat cheese cheesecake: If you like goat cheese, get this!All of this food with 4 beers came out to $112 before tip. Â Food was great, service was great, the whole experience was great. Â Highly recommend."
"I know this is the ""It"" restaurant but i was just not impressed. I tried Escargot Ravioli, Braised Beef Tongue, Confit Goat Belly and just didn't think they were tasty and not something i would crave for. I love the sister restaurant Little Goat much better."
"I don't think I've ever been in a restaurant at which the food and the ambiance were so at war. The food was definitely 5-star. I loved every dish (well, except for the dessert, which we both found underwhelming), and would eat that crispy pig face every day if I could. But the volume was so loud my wife and I nearly had to shout at each other to be heard, and we were the only two at the table! I have no idea why the music was turned up so high, but I've never been in anyplace that wasn't a bar or dance club that had the volume set at that ear-splitting a level. So as a whole, our night there was NOT an enjoyable experience. We were glad when we stepped back out into the street, because as noisy as the traffic sounds were out there, they were silence compared to what was going on inside Girl & The Goat.Which is a shame. If I lived in Chicago, I'd want to go all the time for what the food did to my tongue. But because of what the decibels did to my eardrums, ... nah, I don't think I'd ever go back.Or if I did go back, only while wearing high-end earplugs.My rating is based on averaging the food and the ambiance. And to even get to three stars after nearly being deafened, you can tell the food was DAMN good.Sorry, but when I'm next in Chicago, if I get a hankering for food like this, I'll stick to the Purple Pig."
"I came in with high expectations. Â Too high expectations.Of course, I couldn't get a reservation a month in advance, so my sister and I waited for a table. Â It was about an hour and a half. Â Not too bad. Â But the first come, first serve seating at the bar means that people crowd around you in an attempt to steal your seats the second you move.Any and all of the interactions I had with the staff here just made me feel like they were pretentious. Â We don't want fish on our food, even if that's how it is on the menu. Â Allergies, get it?All and all, I wouldn't say this place is ""Chicago's finest."" Â I'm still in search of that. Â Can't wait to look on Yelp for some better recommendations!"
"Coming into Chicago, I knew nothing about Girl and the Goat except for the fact that it had a thousand reviews and it averaged almost 5 stars. Â That's usually a good sign, so I just blindly booked a reservation and it was our first nice meal in Chicago. Â (Our first official meal in Chicago was White Castle).This restaurant, run by a former Top Chef champion, really did not disappoint. Â They were exceptional with seamlessly combining flavors. Â Their popular pig face, for instance melded together hash-brown like potato sticks with a sunny-side up egg, tamarind-cilantro sauce, a maple based sauce, and the fatty meat. Â The egg yolk and fatty meat melded together and they just collectively dissolved my mouth.I didn't absolutely love their kalbi-beef ribs, but their okra-based sauce just worked and it gave the meat a smooth flavor.My friend's favorite dish of the night was their grilled baby octopus with their lemon-pistachio vinaigrette. Â It was just cooked perfectly and it was a well-balanced dish.The pan-friend shishito peppers melded together roasted peppers, parmesan cheese, miso, and sesame. Â There was a mild heat that was complemented nicely by the cream of the cheese and the salt in the parmesan and miso. Â It was just good.Their ham frites were incredibly creative as well. Â It was our first dish and it set the stage perfectly for what we were to expect. Â They gave us a basket of fries with a tomato aioli and a cheddar beer sauce. Â What we didn't know was the basket mixed fries and battered ham. Â It just worked great.Their crispy braised pork shank was brilliant as well. Â The meat was fork-tender and the skin, fatty. Â The Filipino in me was satisfied as I bit into the fatty-braised skin. Â They serve the meat with a very nice flatbread and a kimchi-based sauce.We also ordered a goat carpaccio, which was a special of the day. Â They served the raw goat with a lemon-based vinaigrette and some selected greens. Â The flavors worked seamlessly and the raw, thinly sliced goat just melts.This place clearly deserves 5 stars and the cost was better than we were expecting. Â It was a great way to kickoff our trip."
"had to make reservations 2 months ahead, and only got a 1045 reservation (granted it was 4th of july weekend)... but it was still well worth the wait! lots of interesting things to try and I loved just about every single one. The home made bread was great (wish I tried all 3) and loved the broccoli, pig face, goat carpaccio, and shishito peppers! My bf went back with his friends the next week to try everything on the menu and they all loved the baby octopus."
"If you are in Chicago, you MUST go here. This is defientely one of the best restaurtants the city has to offer. Try everything, share everything and enjoy!"
"Really good food. We ate tapas style in the front area near the bar. Definitely recommend the octopus dish, super tasty. My favourite was the goat cheese cake, it was very light and delicious. Overall it's a very loud restaurant so bear that in mind if you're planning to bring people who don't hear well."
"I was visiting a friend in Chicago and she told me that this place was amazing but really hard to get a table, especially without a reservation. Â We arrived there on a Sunday night and managed to claim the last bar area for two and we simply pigged out to an absolutely heavenly meal. Â The real question is, what DIDN'T we order?We ordered the Sauteed String beans with a fish sauce vingerette and cashews, which sounds totally weird but were completely addictive and amazing. I literally could not put them down and continued to eat them even after I was full. Â We also got the roasted cauliflower, which had pine nuts in them, and the dish had a great balance of sweetness and nuttiness in flavor. Â The Sugo was excellent with the pappardelle, rosemary, and gooseberries. Â It was a yummy red meat sauce cooked with fresh al dente pasta. Â For the goat dishes, we got the roasted goat shank with red pepperocini-grape relish, goat chorizol and brussel sprouts. Â The goat shank was incredibly tender and flavorful and were practically falling off the bones. Â It was also about the size of my arm so don't order that unless you are in a big group or is your only entree (which I don't recommend as these dishes are meant to be shared). Â We also ordered the Goat Liver Mousse and I can honestly say that I did not enjoy it that much and wished we had just ordered the pretzel bread instead, which looked really yummy at our neighbor's table.The most amazing thing of the night was the escargot ravoli, which had a bacon and tamarind-miso sauce. Â UNBELIEVABLE. Â Whoever thought to put escargot into ravoli was a genius. Â Not to mention that I was practically licking up the sauce, it was that good. Â I could eat a entire plate of that myself.Like I said, between the two of us, we really pigged out. Â I'm coming back here the next time I'm in town."
"We had planned to eat at this place for long time. With all the hype and the great reviews, it did fall below my expectations. Couple of dishes were unique, but disappointed with the others. This restaurant has great wine collection. I will give it one more try."
"The more people have reviewed something, the less I feel I need to say about it.This is a 5 star place. It seems like if you disagree with this, it seems you may be shot by irate review-freaks. That said, there aren't a whole lot of reasons to disagree.Our meal was huge, but the highlights were:Not Campbell's bread: delicious warm, nutty bread with mushroom butter and tomato soup. Lethally fresh.Parmesan cauliflower: killer. If you've ever said you hate cauliflower, prepare to... be wrong. Why anyone would ever steam cauliflower will make no sense. Roasted and with parmesan is the only way.Chickpea fritters: phenomenal. The croquette I waited a long time for, creamy and fried and delicious with an ass kicking sauce.Goat breast: rich, dense goat meat... and some crispy white beans. Favorite of the goat items. The bones slide clean out, the meat shreds with a fork. You will feel medieval.Chocolate Mousse Cake: single greatest dessert I have eaten and I am a dessert hater. The mousse and bourbon ice cream and flaky crunchy thing I didn't recognize rocked my fragile little world. Nothing is the same now.We had others (pig face, chicken, empanadas) that were great but not omgwtfwtf. Their beer list is impressive, not that anyone questions this. Interesting cocktails. Service was strong, the pacing is smart (they do it for you - just order at random), the interior is deceptively HUGE and very dark and rustic. The food is good enough to wait for, which you will likely have to. We were lucky enough to get an 8:15 seating, which is the equivalent to finding a unicorn in the wild. Maybe again, one day."
"Geeze, I almost feel bad giving this place 3 stars, but I have to. Â Perhaps it was high expectations going in, but the food was generally just okay, with a good portion of the dishes being a bit too salty. Â Maybe it was just because of the dishes we ordered, but the four of us ordered nine dishes and I think only two of the dishes stood out to me. Â The best dish of the night, hands down, was the squash ravioli, with mushrooms and shroom creme fraiche. Â This dish was simply delicious - very rich and creamy, but the sweetness from the squash helped to cut into the richness. Â Really good.The other really good dish was the seared scallops - loved the pecans and pumpkin puree with it. Â Perfectly cooked and seasoned - no complaints at all.However, all of the other dishes were just average or way too salty. Â The green beans were average, but the fish sauce was too salty. Â The lamb sausage stuffed calamari was gamey and the pairing just did not impress me - probably needs some type of sweet cranberry sauce to balance the taste. Â The goat, pork, and veal sugo was decent, but again, just average. Â The pig face was a bit too salty and wasn't as good as claimed. Â Service was good. Â No complaints on that end, although, plates came out in random orders."
"Hellooooooo oysters with egg salad - Why it took this long for us to cross paths is beyond me...! Â Holy delicioso! Â This restaurant deserves the hype it gets. Â Our server was awesome and explained every dish clearly and also the way it works here: You order about 3 dishes pp and share. Â Simple enough. Â So here's what we ordered and (sadly) had to share:Oysters - phenomenal. Â It was hard not to devour this after the first one.Pig Face - Yum. Â It sounds gross, but it is tender with a slight crunch and has crazy flavor. Â Could be borderline salty so the portion was just right for us two. Â And it comes with an egg. Â Double Yum.Green Beans - I never knew green beans could be soooooo gooood. Â I mean....wow. Â Best green beans. Â Ever.Bread - something as an appetizer and something forgotten. Â We enjoyed it as we do all carbs, but it can be easily skipped.Scallops? Â Man, I know there was one more, but I don't recall what it was, but believe me, it was prob just as good. Â I don't know what the heck took me so long to write this nor why there is no reminder from my check-in, but now I'm craving as I'm typing. Â Grreeeeat. Â It's a good thing the prices aren't THAT bad - about $100 for two with a round of drinks, I believe. Â BUT, reservations are tough....we sat at 5pm and waited for 2 weeks. Â Well worth the wait. Â Great experience and quality definitely matches the price tag. Â AND it was PACKED when we got there and SLAMMED by the time we left. Â On a Sunday. Â Something tells me I'm not the only one digging oysters and pig face..."
"100. A special review. To me. At the very least it represents my having patronized 100 businesses. Â Some of them were pretty good. Â Some of them... served food. Â As with the businesses they evaluated, some of the reviews were pretty good. Â Others were... grammatically correct. But still, 100. That has to count for something, right? That's got to be worth at least a pat on the back.Well, for my 100th I elected to review a favorite meal. Â In years of watching Top Chef I have oft been insanely jealous of the judges. Â It didn't seem fair that week after week they got to taste the wondrous creations of aspiring chefs while I watched seated with my TV dinners. Â So when an industrious friend secured a reservation at Girl and the Goat, I jumped at the chance to sample one of Top Chef's finest alumni. Â In the weeks leading up to the dinner I could hardly contain my excitement. Â Yet, in the back of my mind I couldn't help but feel I was setting myself up for disappointment.The day finally arrived. Â I got to the restaurant well before my dinner companions. Â There was no way I was going to be late for this meal. Â The hostess directed me to the bar area and a very helpful waitress guided me through their beer menu. Â As I awaited my friends I had a chance to study the restaurant. Â It had a warm open feel to it. Â The place was bustling with excited diners and eager service staff. Â In the open kitchen area cooks were busy preparing meals directed by none other than Ms. Stephanie Izard.As soon as my friends arrived we were led to our table. Â Have you ever received a menu and wanted to try everything on it? That was the case here for me. Â Luckily I am blessed with friends who have a similar enthusiasm for food. Â We each selected two dishes to share.My expectation when I ordered the Crisp Soft Shell Crab and the Smoked Goat Pizza was that they would be my favorite dishes. Â Both were good, especially the citrusy crab served with sweet corn, but both were eclipsed by some of the other preparations. Â The Crispy Pig Face, the Smokey Whipped Fatback and the Braised Beef Tongue, despite the less than enticing names, all proved to be divine. Â A totally unexpected hit for me was the Sauteed Green Beans. Â Served with cashews in a fish sauce vinaigrette, this flavorful dish had me repeatedly reaching for more.The other plates we selected included Seared Scallops with braised veal, Ham Frites and Hiramasa Crudo. Â The Ham Frites was probably my least favorite dish but good nonetheless. Â Juicy crisp pork belly was served atop the crudo adding great texture and flavor to the raw fish preparation.What makes this one of my favorite meals is multifold. Â The service was exceptional, my company was stellar, and the food was exquisite. Â The love with which each dish seemed to have been prepared and the passion exhibited by the wait staff made this more than just a meal but rather a true dining experience. Â My expectations were not only met but greatly exceeded. Â I can't wait to go back.So friends, this is my 100th review. Â I really wanted to write something worthy of the importance the number seems to imply. Â I've probably failed. Â Oh well. Â *Pats self on back*"
"Amazing. The food was unique and delicious. It took me 3 months to get a reservation and I can say with confidence it was worth it. Escargot ravioli was to die for, as were the goat ribs and the frites and everything else. Only drawback was that it was a little expensive....but still totally worth it!"
"After coming here 5+ times, we had one poor experience and the manager invited us back to make it 'right' and we had a completely different, wonderful experience. Service was great and we enjoyed our meal.Thank you to the goat."
I don't think Girl & the Goat needs my review to garner business. Everyone knows it's almost impossible to get a reservation here. The food is phenomenal and so creative. Â I have been blown away every time I eat here. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants of all time!
"It's my 200th review!!! The Yelp gods must have been smiling on me in honor of this monumental event, because I managed to get in to G&TG in under an hour as a walk-in on a Friday night! Technically speaking, this may not have been as big a miracle as opentable would have you think. According to the hostess, they actually keep a number of slots open for walk-ins every night, which is pretty awesome. We did get there at around 5:30, which obviously helped our cause, but still, under an hour is pretty darn impressive! On to the important stuff...food! As you probably know by now, it's amazing. Creative, not overly complicated, and perfectly seasoned. We asked our waitress to just bring out any combination of 5 or 6 small plates. This is always my favorite way to order, since you know you're getting the good stuff. Standouts were the crab rangoon, pig face, and green beans in fish sauce, but really every single dish was really really good. We also had a dessert, which was phenomenal - chocolate ice cream over a chocolate brownie thing with marshmallow fluff creamy stuff...mmmmmm. Service was perfect, atmosphere was fun. This place lived up the hype big time. I couldn't have picked a better place for review #200!"
"My husband and I went to Chicago for our 1 year anniversary. We made reservations at 1030 after seeing Book of Mormon and even though we had to settle for such a late reservation, it was so worth it. If you are visiting Chicago you need to eat here. We ordered raw oysters, broccoli, goat belly, escargot ravioli, scallops and pig face. We were skeptical about the pig face but it was wonderful!! We enjoyed everything we ordered but the escargot ravioli was the best. Got peach bucket for dessert which was excellent as well! Bottom line - go here!"
"First, I need to say that the service was quite chaotic; I went for reservation by 9.30pm, and they told me that until 11pm I could not have a seat (even though they close by 11pm). I arrived to the place by 10.50pm, and they suggested us to take a sit in the bar, and they could serve the food there. Finally, after ordering the food, they move us to a table. So I assume part of this chaotic situation in part because my reservation was too late... so it's fine. About the food, a simple word: AMAZING! My favorite dish was the green beans. The best I've never eaten in my life! In addition we had a bread with goat cheese that was also incredible. And the rest of the plates we tried were also outstanding. Reasonable price overall. Definitely it was worth to wait. And the decoration of the place is really great, and very well done. Be sure to try if you visit Chicago (and to make a reservation in advance!)"
"If Girl & The Goat was some form of bestiality then consider me a zoophile because I love this place.Word of advice, make your reservation months in advance if you plan on dining on a weekend. I made mine over a month in advance and all I could get was 4:45PM on a Monday.The service here is spectacular. Our server, Hunter, was top notch and recommended wonderful dishes. He checked on us a few minutes after every dish was brought out.Food wise:- OYSTER SAMPLER: We tried all 3 (raw, woodfire and fried). The raw one provided the most flavor. Woodfire just a warm version of the raw. Unfortunately, I couldn't taste much of the oyster for the fried one but I love everything fried :)- GRILLED BABY OCTOPUS: Very refreshing and tasty. The pistachios were a nice touch.- PORK SHANK: I was hesitant at first because of my previous dinner at Purple Pig but this dish was outstanding. The meat juicy, tender and fell off the bone easily. Kimchee dipping sauce was nice.- GOAT RIBS: The winner of the night. I've never had goat before but I figured it would be close to lamb. The result? Ribs with the perfect amount of fat. Super juicy and fell right off the bone. Not gamey whatsoever.- FRUIT BEER: Good for the lady- PUMPKIN ALE: Seasonal and medium ale. The pumpkin touch was very nice. Cheers to an overall wonderful dining experience. I would love to come back here again."
"Girl and Goat is one of those places that colors all other dining experiences. Â My girlfriend and I dined here for her birthday, and we simply could not have asked for more. As many have noted, reservations to this place are hard to come by. Â Plan months in advance if you want to be assured a spot. Â I thought I was on top of my game by checking about two months in advance; I was not. Â Thankfully, my girlfriend was fine with having an early dinner so we arrived right when it opened. Â Much to our delight, we were seated fairly quickly. Â We ordered the raw oysters, Hiramasa Crudo, the obligatory Wood Oven-Roasted Pig Face, and the Goat Confit with Crab and Lobster. Â The progression of dishes was spot on. Â Each time the server brought us a dish, we almost forgot how good the other dishes were. Â The crudo is topped with the most delicious pork belly I've ever had. Â The pig face was surprisingly hearty and slightly sweet. Â It was oddly reminiscent of the flavors of some of the Filipino dishes I grew up with. Â But it was the Goat Confit with Crab and Lobster that left me speechless. Â The goat was so tender and it had just enough sauce to bring out the flavor. Â And can you ever go wrong by adding crab and lobster to a dish? Â We finished our meal by ordering the goat cheesecake. Â It was small, but it was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. Â It was, as the server suggested, surprisingly light, with just enough savoriness to balance the sweetness of the cheesecake.I can't wait to come back!"
"After two more visits....I must say, that I am still a fan. Â I'm just in awe of how packed they were on a Wednesday night. Â At 5:30pm(!!!) Â Good for them! Â I love seeing a restaurant doing well.Their fall menu is lovely. Â Fairly simple, but very well done. Â Get one of their bread starters......I know it's kinda silly paying for bread service, but it's certainly worth it here.The clams/octopus are still excellent. Â Their accompaniments have been altered to fit with the fall menu. Â Oooh, and don't forget to try the goat loin! Â We chose this particular goat dish to try because it sounded the most simple. Â And it was. Â It was very tender. Â I highly recommend it. Â Ooooh, and you absolutely must try their goat cheese and blueberry dessert. Â I adored it.Dine.here.STAT!"
"First of all let me say, what a breath of fresh air! This place has all of the food that you would expect at a classy, pretentious restaurant, but is not pretentious. We came in at about 7 pm on a Saturday evening without a reservation and the hostess said that the wait would be about 3 hours. We did not care though, we were in no rush to eat at such a highly talked about restaurant. The cool thing was that you didn't need to be dressed in slacks and a sport coat to eat here, which was great because it was 98 degrees and very humid....and we walked from Ohio! Â We went across the street to a local brewpub for an hour, came back and got a seat at the bar within 5 minutes(pure luck) and stayed there for the rest of the night and had 3 wonderful courses of roasted cauliflower, goat belly and pig face! I'm kind of in a hurry so I will just say that they were all excellent although the cauliflower could have used a bit more charring.  Bottom line is that this is a great restaurant with a great atmosphere and if you are in the Chicagoland area you should definitely try it soon! Stephanie kicks butt at this place and was on the outside expo line through the entire dinner rush making sure that every dish was executed perfectly. Bravo to you Stephanie, and hope to see many successful years for this restaurant."
"God I'm a loser. Â I just went to Girl and the Goat for the first time. Â It always seemed my only options were a 4:45 resie, or even better....9:45. Â So I always just passed up the opportunity to dine there. Â That is until I was let in on a little secret from a co-worker of mine.""There's a little lounge area and some bar seats that are first come first serve and if you arrive before 6PM on a weekday you'll have no problem snagging a spot."" Â So when my sister thanked me for her baby shower by way of Girl and the Goat gift certificate I knew it was time to test out my friend's theory. Â I invited her and another gal pal and off we went straight from work arriving at about 5:45. Â Seats galore in the lounge area. Â So that's where we placed our bottoms.The food was marvelous, of course there was never any doubt. Â The octopus was to die for. Â As were the scallops with roasted duck. Â Seriously I was pulling the ole ""hey what's that over there"" and stealing more than my fair share of it. Â Sorry gals, you snooze you lose! Â The goat empanada on special - forget about it. Â So. Damn. Good. Â Beer and wine lists were expansive and the beers I tried were just my taste.Our server wasn't attentive enough at first, but she got on a roll once the place started picking up and we never sat with an empty glass. Â And she was just really sweet and accommodating which is always a plus.Something else to note - when we went in were told we could be put on the waiting list which would be at least an hour but could still drink and dine on the couches if we so desired while we waited. Â Twenty minutes later they called our name but we remained in the lounge - comfy and bright."
"Girl and the Goat6/20/2012The Girl and the Goat has now cemented itself as my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I have heard from numerous people that it didn't meet their expectations and I can honestly say that it keeps surpassing mine. My friend and I arrived at 5:30 on a Wednesday evening without reservations. I can't help but think about the numerous amounts of people that fail trying to make reservations and just assume there is no way they can eat there. There is no reason to frown if you fail trying to make reservations 3 months in advance.If you don't mind eating dinner at the senior citizen hour then forget the reservations and walk-in on a weeknight anywhere from 4:30 to 5:30. We were lucky enough to be seated right away at the chefs table. That's right!! We came here Anthony Bourdain style with no reservations and we were sat at the chefs table. Boooooyah!The service was absolutely perfect and extremely welcoming. While sitting at the chef's table we were able to make conversation with Chris and Brian while they were cooking while the famous Top Chef winner Stephanie Izzard was expediting orders less than 5 feet away from us. I have been to my fair share of celebrity chef restaurants where it is obvious that the chef hasn't stepped foot in the building since the ribbon cutting. Stephanie Izzard is not that type of celebrity chef and I doubt she ever will be.To start off we ordered the Spence Wheat Bread with peanut butter butter and blackberry honey. Â This has to be the type of pb & j that Jesus eats. Â Our second dish was the roasted beets with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. This was really tasty but not anywhere near our favorite dish of the night. The top three items we ate were the grilled pork ribs (tomatillo-mushroom slaw, grilled scallion vinaigrette), wood grilled broccoli (rogue blue cheese, spice crispies) and the halibut (I forgot what it was with but it was redic!).Lastly, we shared the goat cheese cheesecake which was like crack. Everything from the atmosphere, service, and food was enough to keep me coming back like Rush Limbaugh at a pain medicine specialist. Buy the hype people, unless you have an addictive personality and not a lot of money to spend (even though the prices are really reasonable)."
"Everytime I've been here, I've been extremely impressed. Not only is service spot on, but the dishes are phenomenal. Of course there are some better dishes than others, but even the ""least enjoyed"" dishes are amazing; which says a lot. I would suggest getting a bunch of different dishes to share amongst a group- don't forget about dessert, certainly worth saving room for."
"About 30 seconds into ""Dog Days are Over"" by Florence + The Machine, the staff started clapping along. Â Not just a few - at least 15 of them. Â A weirdly fun and endearing aspect of our Girl & the Goat experience that made us all smile. With at least four people, you'll get to try way more dishes. Â Anticipating that we would probably not get to eat here again for a while, the amount of food we managed to consume was ridiculous. Â It was worth it. Â I usually don't eat seafood of any kind due to a scarring childhood event involving my mom feeding me some fish for dinner then pointing it out the next day at the aquarium. Â On rare occasions I'll get over myself, and it paid off with the hiramasa crudo served with comically thin pieces of bread and pork belly. Â As for the meat, the crispy duck tongues and pig face were awesome. If you can't get over the visual their names invoke, you're doing yourself a disservice. Â Hopefully you get a kick out of eating weird cuts of meat, too.The amount of thought put into the vegetable dishes needs to be acknowledged. Â My favorites were the smoky grilled broccoli with bleu and spice crispies and super creamy chickpea fritters. Â Our meal was overall stellar with a couple anomalies - the floppy crust of the goat cheese pizza or the really fatty goat breast, though the rich flavor and side of white beans made up for it.They paced the dishes for us with smaller plates first and larger later, which meant meat palooza towards the end. Â Around the time of the pizza and goat breast, my friends gave up on eating - more food for me."
"Full review in the blog - dishes and summary below.Having explained to my hilarious and helpful server that I'd be flying out that evening the evening's dining got started quickly after ordering - the first dish to arrive would be my bread selection. Â While some may quibble about a restaurant charging for bread, if most breads were baked in house and tasted this good I'd gladly pay. Â Served as a sliced loaf and piping hot from the oven, Spence Wheat Bread with ""Hunk-a-burnin' Love Butter"" with Bacon, Banana, and Peanut Butter plus Wildflower Honeycomb was excellent. Â Hearty and fragrant on its own the bread was only improved with the decidedly calorific spread. Â Adding honey only made things more interesting and I only wished my sister, a fan of such sandwiches (sans bacon) in her childhood could have been there to share - it was definitely filling.The second course to arrive, as I was enjoying the bread and chatting with the chefs, would be Kabocha Squash Ravioli with Mushroom Raisin Ragout, Brussels leaves, Shroom CrÃ¨me Fraiche. Â Having asked my server about portion sizes to avoid large plates this dish was significantly larger than billed - seven Raviolis compared to the four promised - and each was delectable, perfectly cooked, and stuffed to near bursting with a nutty but sweet puree of squash. Â Complimenting the raviolis was a light and earthy whipped sauce, pungent Brussels sprouts, and fibrous mushrooms intermingling with golden raisins. Â Never one to complain about more food if it is good I have no complaints at all.The next course to arrive would be perhaps the most talked about dish at TGatG - the Wood Oven Roased Pig Face with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, potato stix. Â Described at length in many of blogs and reviews the dish was every bit as good as the rumors. Â With the pig's tongue rolled in the center of the facial fat and musculature and formed into a sausage the braised dish was crisp on the exterior and creamy within - something akin to trotters but more, if it is a word, porky. Â Adding some levity to the decidedly heavy protein were drizzles of savory cilantro and tamarind oils while lightly fried thin cut potatoes added some crunch. Â Topping the dish with a golden fried egg topped with sea salt and black pepper I watched the whole dish come together at the braising station before my eyes and as much as I enjoyed eating it, watching the construction was even more exciting - without overexaggerating, the kitchen at TGatG is every bit as much fun to watch as Volt's Table 21 or Ko.While everything I had at Izard's establishment was great, it was the Lamb Sausage Stuffed Calamari with Sweet Garlic, Sweetbread Crisp, Currant Saor alone that made me want to stand up and bow to the chefs behind the counter. Â With three perfect cephalopods stuffed with succulent lamb at its core the dish really didn't need much more - but then you add two crispy chunks of thymus, pureed and sliced roasted garlic, and a sweet reduction of currants. Â An absolute must order that shows off Izard's deft hand with seafood and the restaurant's house curing of sausage and salumi all at once.Having eaten my savories in just under an hour I gladly agreed to take a look at the dessert menu when it was offered. Â Arriving first would be the ""house special"" according to my server and the chef - Cocoa Nip Donuts with pomegranate Ganache, brut sabayon, smoked pear, pine nut brittle. Â With the donuts plucked directly from the deep fryer each was stuffed with bitter dark chocolate and resting atop a bed of small chocolate chips and boozy cream. Â Adding sweetness but leaving the dish largely bitter-sweet was a compote of pears and pomegranate plus a saccharine sweet brittle adding crunch. Â Amazing interplay of flavors, textures, and temperatures.My final taste at TGatG would be delivered as Sticky Date Cake with three philosopher's marshmallow, meyer lemon quince, and pepita crunch. Â Thick and dense the date cake was a textbook preparation - incredibly sweet, heavy with spice, and steaming hot. Â Topping the dish with a slowly melting marshmallow that tasted faintly of beer and tangy chopped quince the whole dish was pepped up again by a ""brittle,"" this time from candied squash seeds. Â Asking me how it was the chef informed me this was a new addition to the menu for the coming weeks and I strongly suggested he whip one up for himself during a break - and keep it on the menu for some time to come.On my arrival home I was met with the news that Michelin had released the first half of their awards - the Bib Gourmand list - and The Girl and the Goat had been named to the list. Â While Bib Gourmand is certainly an honor, having been to Casa Mono and other Michelin Starred ""bargain"" spaces in New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco all I can say is that The Girl and the Goat is every bit worth the hype and after another year of maturing I've no doubt it will net a star if things continue as they are."
"Amazing food, great service and great atmosphere.very reasonably priced too! Â Love this place! Need to book a table many weeks in advance though but well worth the wait."
"Finally had the opportunity to try the restaurant after friends made reservations for us a couple months ago for a Tuesday night at 8:15. Â We got there a little early, the atmosphere had a hip, busy vibe, the Spanish Harlem and 4:15 to Georgia cocktails were excellent. Â But It wasn't until we were seated with our friends and the food started coming that it became clear why G & G has maintained its popularity. Â The food was amazing ... Particularly the pork shank, green beans (yes green beans) and the most spectacular cauliflower I've ever had. Â Other dishes were all very good but those 3 made it an excellent experience."
"It took only a nanosecond to say yes to an invite to dine at Girl and the Goat. I have a girl crush on Stephanie Izard, for reals. I may or may not have spied her at Midsommarfest one year and jumped up and down with excitement like a giddy teenager to the bewilderment of my friend; fortunately I maintained my composure this time. I did have a small ""oh crap"" moment after accepting the invite, see this girl doesn't eat goat or any of its red-blooded friends. Fortunately, it's not impossible for those not eating any or certain meats to dine here, but it obviously limits your options. The space is great; dark without feeling like a cave and packed without feeling cramped. Service was impeccable from start to finish, so attentive and friendly. The staff glided around the bustling space, like an artfully choreographed dance. Someone on one side of the table would fill our waters and shuttle away the empty bottle and seconds later another person would glide by the other side and deliver a new one. We started with some bread accompanied by a sweet onion butter and herb oil. The bread was warm, crusty and delicious, both spreads great compliments to it. The carb-whore in me wanted to order a second plate and not share it. The mains, meant to be shared, fall into three categories: vegetable, fish and meat with approximately 7 choices in each. I tried the pan fried shishito peppers with parmesan, sesame, and miso; chickpeas fritters with heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzarella; seared scallops with pumpkin brandade, pecans, fried brussel sprouts, tarragon, and pomegranate; pan roasted barramundi with black beans, buttermilk squash, and chicken of the woods mushrooms and a glass of pinot grigio to wash it down. All of the dishes were quite good, and well seasoned; I can rarely eat a meal without adding salt or pepper, but didn't even consider it here. I think my favorite of the four was the scallop dish; the scallops were perfectly cooked and succulent and the brussel sprouts were a great complement. My next favorite was the chickpea dish, I loved the way the flavors and textures balanced each other out. The other two dishes may have fallen to the bottom of my list, but there really were no losers here; even my least favorite dishes were still delicious. I'm not one to rush out to try new, hot places, but this is well worth the trip and not nearly as spendy as I expected. It was a fantastic experience from start to finish, just don't expect to pop in without a reservation."
"My fiance took me here for my birthday and I'll say that the there are only two things I wish we did differently: made reservations not for a work night and not order the string bean dish (kind of disappointing with a strange taste). Â Everything else was simply delicious, especially the birria, a stew dish that I can still taste almost two weeks later. Â I could absolutely eat this whole dish by myself ... and if I didn't have to fit into a wedding gown in two weeks I would have absolutely said Why Not!I will say that the restaurant was surprisingly loud for a Tuesday night dinner at 9:45, especially on 9/11, but it's only a testiment to the popularity and innovative cuisine that chef Stephanie Izzard provides your tastebuds. Â I definitely look forward to going again and hope that I can go with a larger party in order to taste more dishes."
"Oh my goodness.Oh MY GOODNESS.My family came here after convincing me that they called twice to make sure there would be something that a vegan such as myself could eat. Well lo and behold, we get there and they have a separate vegan menu which you can ask for.I tried a vegetable tempura, a kohlrabi salad, and a chickpea masala which was unlike any that I've ever eaten.It was all so good... I'm still dreaming about it.It was also good enough that my nonvegan family didn't hesitant to help me clean my plates. I need to go back."
"Absolutely one of the best meals ever. Service was awesome, drinks complimented perfectly.Try everything you can!!"
"1st time in Chicago and heard fabulous reviews of Girl & The Goat from Yelp and friends, so of course we gave it a shot. From staff to decor, to the teamwork of the chefs and the fantastic arrangements of flavor in the food, we were on board! This place was even PACKED on a Tuesday night! The vibe was awesome, and we even made a few friends with two Canadian chefs that were also dining at the restaurant (Probably because we were seated at the coveted chef's table). They thoroughly enjoyed their Â food and excitedly watched the chefs work their magic. The roasted cauliflower dish was the best cauliflower dish I've ever had! The pork shank and pig face are a must, and the miso-butterscotch budino (custard dessert) was a party in my mouth! Gluten-free? No problem! We enjoyed these items off the gluten free menu, and their GF bread by the way is freshly made (served warm). I highly recommend the ginger butter with applesauce accompaniment. I love sharing plates, and this is definitely the place to do so. Enjoy and Bon Apetit!"
"One of the few places that really lived up to the hype for me. Â I walked in by myself at around 9:15 on a Tuesday and found a seat at the bar within 10 minutes. Â The bar and lounge area have open seating. Â I asked the waitress for help and she said I should order 2-3 dishes. Â Since I hadn't eaten anything really all day, I ordered 4 things.Raw Oysters - I'm not sure the variety - although they looked like a pacific variety, were sweet, with a nice tart mignonette.Rye Bread with smoked salmon cream cheese and pickled onions - I am a sucker for pickled veggies and these were really good - extremely tart and briny. Â One of my favorite things there.Scallops - there were 2 enormous scallops, served with shredded duck and a duck jus. Â The scallops were expertly cooked, sweet and fresh.Crispy pork shank - one of the best things to ever come across my lips. Â It was like a slow roasted pork shank, except that it was crispy - totally blew my mind. Â A few bites of this and entered a food coma. Â Excellent beer menu. Â I passed on dessert, but this dinner cost about $75 including tax and gratuity."
"Being someone who doesnt usually eat meat out at restaurants, i was extremely skeptical of this place. Much of the menu contains pork and other meat dishes but it being a recommended place by a friend, we went anyway. I think that was probably the best decision we made.the ambiance of the place is great, the music is a bit loud but otherwise the restaurant is really nice. Our waiter was attentive, asked us about our dietary restrictions and recommended dishes based on that. We had the roasted cauliflower, chickpea fritters, Kohirabi salad, and the pan roasted white fish. Every single dish was amazing, very simple but very delicious. I would definitely recommend this place to everyone and I wish they would open one in NYC!"
"So, here I go writing another review among the thousands already floating around Yelp for this restaurant. Â I couldn't resist. Â I have been DYING to go to Girl & the Goat for months now but figured I'd never be lucky enough to snag one of their seeming unattainable reservations. Â However, my friend informed me that there are only a certain number of tables set aside for reservations and that usually, if you don't mind waiting, you can get in without a reservation. Â We gave it a shot. Â I almost expected them to laugh at us when I walked in last night-- not the case. Â We arrived around 7:00 and had to wait an hour for a table. Â Yes, that's a long time but it was worth it. Â Plus, we just had cocktails at the bar and chatted while we waited for our table. Â All in all, not too shabby and it beats waiting another 2 months to try this place with a reservation.Let me just say that the food here really does live up to the hype. Â Our waitress, Veronica, was bright, friendly and extremely helpful. Â The service overall was excellent and the staff all really seemed to be enjoying their jobs-- always a plus. Â Veronica told us to order at least 2 small plates per person to share. Â We got five total, plus dessert, and it was all amazing!Started out with the chickpea fritters and raw shigoku oysters. Â I believe I read in a previous review that the fritters melt in your mouth-- they really do!Then we had the goat liver mousse. Â This was one of my favorite dishes of the night. Â It was accompanied with smoked pear, pickles (yum) and a pineapple relish, which really complimented the flavors. Â Just think of piling all of this deliciousness onto an even more delicious vessel-- the crumpets. Â I can't stop raving about these things. Â They're like biscuits on steroids.Next came the red rock shrimp ceviche. Â It was good but pretty standard with a very bright citrus and cilantro flavor profile. Â Obviously, for the finale we had the much regaled crispy pig face. Â OMG. Â Hands down one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. Â It was served with a fried sunny-side egg, potato sticks, cilantro and tamarind. Â I can't stop thinking about this dish and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Â Thank you, Yelpers, for pointing me in the right direction on this one. Â I'm pretty sure I'd never have selected this dish on my own.Finished the night with chocolate cake and bourbon gelato. Â The cake was so dense and rich, it was more like a brownie. Â Yum.Overall, had a wonderful experience at this restaurant and I was so thrilled I was able to try it. Â I can't wait to go back. Â Happy eating, boys and girls!"
Two words: pig face. Typically this combination of words is used to insult someone...in this instance it will delight.The food here is honestly named and definitely delicious. In addition the atmosphere is beautifully done with dark undertones - I love the burnt wood center wall - and the staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. Bravo to both the girl and the goat for a winning combination of elements. Â We had...Goat belly confit - belly in my belly...so good.Skewered Lamb Heart -don't let the name scare you.Chorizo Flat Breads - aaamazing..highly recommended. Softshell crab - so good we ordered another Doughnuts (pork fat) - yikes...and i mean that in a good way.Be forewarned - GATG is akin to the restaurant 'Dorsia' in the movie American Psycho...you must book far in advance to get a 'res'.
"Overall our meal at Girl & the Goat was very good. Â The ingredients were fresh and the execution for the majority of the dishes was excellent. Â Nearly a five star dinner . . .However, a few things really detracted from the experience.1. Â You have two options when you arrive, since reservations are impossible to obtain at any reasonable dinner time. Â First, you can request a reservation in person and wait 1, 2, or 3 hours. Â Second, you can order from the full menu at the bar.Obviously, the bar option seems like a good compromise. Â But in reality it's exactly like pulling up to a gas station during a fuel crisis. Â Instead of cars, groups of PEOPLE scan the bar like vultures, jockeying to place themselves as close behind the patrons at the bar they think will be finished eating first. Â If you are polite and respectful of others personal space . . .you'll never eat. Â This may not be a big detracting factor for some people, but I despise feeling like human cattle.2. Â The salt was excessive for my taste, but I tend to be salt averse. Â Also some of the dressing and sauces were too much for the portion size of the dish.We thoroughly enjoyed the food along with the beer menu (wonderful selection), and will likely return if a reservation can be obtained in advance."
"Reservations are about a month out, be sure to make one!! The food is delicious, and small portions so you are able to try everything out. The servers are knowledgeable and kind. Good adult beverages. The pork loin is amazing.Parking is kind of a pain."
"Excellent!!! The flavors are rich and vibrant--there are lots to choose from! Some of our friends have reservations weeks, if not months, in advance to dine here. We were definitely strolling by on our way to a reservation at another restaurant when my husband stopped in to ask if they could accommodate our party of 6 and the answer was,""yes"" as long as we were out by 8pm for an upcoming reservation! You best believe we canceled our former reservation and waited a mere 10 minutes before we were seated!I love family style portions...enough to taste much of the menu! The only gripe I have is that we were told checks could not be split between our entire party since all the portions are shared. I'm not sure if we were misinformed, but that was pretty inconvenient considering 3 separate couples in 1 party. Our waitress said she could only accept 2 cards and split the total in half. This still wouldn't prevent me from going back...I'm just glad I know now before inviting others to join."
"Believe the hype. The food is fantastic, the atmosphere is very inviting and vibrant and this well staffed hot spot seems to have great service down to a science. A few items you will definitely want to try: -Chickpea fritter -Pan roasted barramundi -Seared scallops -Pan fried shishito peppers -Whatever kind of bread you can get your hands on to dip in that sweet onion butter. Unpretentious, not overly extravagant and not ""I need to donate plasma before I can eat here"" pricey. Great place to grab a nice dinner and drinks with girlfriends/boyfriends but don't forget to make a reservation."
"Category: Foodie - Overall 4 stars (4.5)Food: B+We got:1) Oysters (raw): Shibumi w/ radish mignonette & tarragon: A+If you like raw oysters w/ additional flavor but doesn't drown out the oyster this is a great dish to get. Â 2) Lamb Sausage Stuffed Calamari (sweet garlic,sweetbread crisp & currants): CThis dish was good/average. Â The calamari taste/texture was good, the stuffed lamb sausage was a bland & dry - which over powered the Calamari. Â 3) Sauteed Green Beans (fish sauce vinaigrette): BVery tasty, but something I could prob find elsewhere or replicate.4) Arctic Char (aka Salmon): A+Everything was done well - the flavor & the texture of the fish was amazing. Â Cocktails: B- Â Interesting offerings. Â Not awesome, not awful. Â Approx ~$10Atmosphere/Service: ATrendy. Â Not too quiet, not too noisy. Â Overall fun place to go either with friends or on a date. Â  Walked in & didn't wait for seating on a weeknight.Price: BExpect to shell out a good chunk of change. Â The portions are smallish & the plates are about $10-30 each The farther down the menu the larger the portions & price. Â Recommend sharing. Â Think of it like Tapas on steroids. Â YUM!"
"The manner in which various ingredients are combined is what G&G is known for. The menu was different each time we visited but never a disappointment. Be prepared for small plates but explosive bits.The white fish, chickpeas fritters (a must), beet salad (and i hate beets), and Goat Empanadas were amazing.I'd pass on the Hiramasa Crudo (too small and not really worth the taste)."
"Give me food with flavor and I am a happy girl. A happy goat-eating girl. Stephanie Izard did not disappoint because every single thing we had was packed with delicious flavor--my taste buds were working overload.We ordered:1. Pretzel bread--greasy goodness2. Wood-fired oysters--my very first taste of oysters, phenomenal!3. Ham frittes--cheesy goodness4. Goat, pork and veal sugo--one of the best things we had that night, meat just melted in your mouth5. Grilled beef short ribs with edamame, fantastic6. Sauteed shrimp, peanut pork ragout, shiitake mushrooms--second best thing we ordered, delightful flavors7. Sauteed green beans--I thought they were undercooked8. Goat cheese dessert of some kind, can't remember, good but I felt the goat cheese overpowered the whole thingContrary to popular belief, it is easy to get reservations, you just have to dine really early (5ish) or late (9ish or later). I had made reservations and when we arrived, the hostess tried to seat us at the two top overlooking the kitchen (their supposed best table in the house), but I said no thanks, I don't want to inhale a kitchen grease fire, please give us a normal table away from the kitchen. Our server was an odd combination of overly excited and disinterested, but I think he was just cranky from having to explain the menu a hundred times. The food here is original, creative, full of flavor, and exciting. For that reason alone, I'm bumping it up to 5 stars. I encourage any chef that shies away from blandness and dares to satisfy my taste buds.G & G is loud, but rustic, cozy, and romantic. The mood was right, the wine was good, the food was amazing, and my man was looking dreamy across the table--I was one happy girl."
Honestly just eh. The food was interesting but with no solid familiarity. The cocktail list wasn't anything but rich. The food was well thought out but just a bit far left and very sauce driven. The saving grace were the incredible desserts - the butterscotch dish as well as the ruby red grapefruit. Insanely good. The rest just ok.
"Ever since I saw Stephanie win on Top Chef, or anyone win for that matter, I have wanted to try their food. FINALLY, someone decided to set up shop in Chicago. Located in the West Loop, the Girl and the Goat seems to always be busy and booked, even on a Tuesday at 9:15pm....so make your reservations early. The playlist of music is great, trendy tunes you'd expect to hear in a new and upcoming restaurant. The decor is DARK, very industrial. You almost just ignore the room around you, since you are surrounded by people to your left and right. It the volume gets high, though everyone's noise just drowns out when you start to taste....We started with local beers (Two Brothers beer on tap for me) and a house made smoky bread. Accompanying the bread was BLUE CHEESE BUTTER and an apple cinna-minny spread. Ridiculous good. It may be inappropriate, but after the bread was long gone, I was eating the blue cheese with my fork. Omg....fatfat.....I'll go to the gym tomorrow, I swear.Following that, it was a blur. The dishes are small, to share. You order many at a time and the staff will space them out. We had pig face, seared scallops, roasted beets, lamb sausage-stuffed calamari, a steak salad kind of thing....The food just blended. The flavors were meant to be together. It is well worth the money also. Prices are reasonable, not hyped up because of who she is. I have a new found love for beets. As you may guess, the food is seasonal. I cannot wait to go back in the spring and summer and see what surprises she's throws at me. Maybe I will meet her next time....We left happy, laughing...Signing the receipt ticket ""Paddy Pants Colicchio"" for Padme and Tom. And writing ""Goat Farts"" on the bottom. Real comedians.Then we saw our car was towed....FML. On another note, the parking sucks, though valet is available."
"What can I say that has not been already said? Great food and friendly service. Â We had the broccoli, pork shank, pig face and the peach cobbler. Â  We were lucky enough to sit up at the kitchen and see those culinary experts at work."
"A great meal? Â Definitely. Â A great ambiance? Â I think so. Â The best of communal eating? Â For sure.The ambiance of Girl and the Goat I would describe as alternative urban rustic - very representative of the neighborhood where its located. Â The somewhat bizarre, somewhat intriguing massive painting on the wall has a weird looking character staring out at you ... yet the rest of the restaurant has dark wood and a near warehouse feel. Â The smell of the yummy food hits you when you arrive (unfortunately it stays on you after you leave too).Everything we ordered was fantastic. Â The waiter recommended 2-3 dishes per person, and I can confidently say that 2 per person is absolutely more than enough (if not too much for our group of 6). Â We were completely stuffed and didn't even touch our last dish because we were already replete - no room for dessert sadly. The shishito peppers, green beans and butternut squash ravioli were among my favorites (and I'm not a vegetarian). Â I like the concept for the restaurant. Â We figured out the meaning behind the name when we were there. Â The restaurant buys a goat, and then throughout the week they will offer different parts of the goat as the special."
"Wagyu tartare, diver scallops, mushroom ragout. Â This place was top top top for food, and I've eaten a lot of good food."
Everything was amazing. PB & J desert was out of this world.
"I waited three months for my *Monday evening* reservation at Girl & the Goat. Â It was not worth the wait.Girl & the Goat is a pretty good restaurant, but it's totally overhyped and not worth booking reservations months in advance. Â I really liked our waitress, she was nice, made pretty good recommendations, and was great about my husband's food allergy (she had the same allergy, which helped put us at ease too). Â But once the food arrived we found ourselves repeatedly comparing it to our favorite, Purple Pig. Â The menus are very similar (minus the goat, of course), and for everything that has a similar offering at Purple Pig, Pig does it better - especially the broccoli and pork.The goat empanada was so-so. Â 5411 Empanada Truck is far more inventive with their flavor panel and infinitely more satisfying.The overpriced ribs were inedible to me - but to be fair, my husband did enjoy them. Â I found them too fatty, salty and vinegar-y. Â The mussels were very good, and at the waitress's suggestion, we enjoyed dipping the ham frites in the broth. Â Certainly the highlight of the meal.Desserts were unappealing to us, so we took advantage of the beautiful evening weather and walked up to Pinkberry.Sorry G&GT, I really wanted to love you."
"Went on a Tuesday night and ate almost half the menu. It was phenomenal! We tried:All the oysters, ceviche, diver scallops, green beans, roasted cauliflower, shishito peppers, kohlrabi salad, grilled baby octopus, pork face with duck confit, goat belly confit and crab, goat cheesecake and chocolate cherry dessert. Â The chef's put out a fearless menu and it is topped off with friendly, knowledgeable and helpful staff."
"The only thing that stops me from giving it five stars is it's freaking impossible to get a reservation here!!!!! Â Impossible might not be the RIGHT word, but it sure is difficult. Â If you can manage to get a table though, you're in for a treat. Â First, I can't say enough about the fresh baked breads and oyster selections to start the meal. Â The options rotate but that just makes it all the more exciting!!!After several trips to Girl & the Goat, one of my favorite dishes is still the chickpea fritters. Â They have the perfect crunch on the outside but stay creamy and soft inside. Â Seriously, they melt in your mouth and just make you happy. Â The shishito peppers weren't my favorite thing on the menu. Â Unless you get a spicy one, they are pretty bland and oily. Â But the roasted cauliflower, holy smokes...it is prepared simply but another one of my favorite things on the menu.The diver scallops and hiramasa crudo are two of my favorites from the seafood section of the menu. Â But both the tongue selections were out of this world...for real for real. Â I guess I've been on a crispy duck tongue binge lately, but the duck tongues here were something I would definitely order again. Â I think I've gotten the braised beef tongue every time I've been lucky enough to eat here. Â It really is that good.The waitstaff is super helpful and, generally, does a good job pacing the meal. Â They are also pretty good at recommending drink pairings to bring out the most in your courses. Â Will I go back again???? Â Of course. Â Even if it means a 945pm reservation on a Tuesday night??? Â Yeah, probably...I'll just have a late lunch!!!"
"Amazing. Simply, amazing. I was surprised I was able to score a reservation on the same day as my last night out in Chicago for 6:45pm, when I've heard people make reservations months in advance. Lucky me! Anyways, to sum it up the decor and ambiance is clean and simple, they have a nice selection of craft beers (wish there was more on tap!), and our waitress was super helpful in assisting us make decisions because everything on the menu sounded amazing. Easy to say that I had an great night. Ended up going with the Goat Ribs, Pork Shank, Baby Octopus, Scallops, and one of their salads. Literally, everything was amazing and I get hungry just thinking back to that meal. If you get a chance to snag a reservation day of, JUMP ON IT! This place lives up to the hype. And props to our waitress for hooking it up with a smaller size of their bittersweet chocolate cake (topped with caramel ice cream if I recall correctly?). I was feeling stuffed after 5 dishes and 3 beers, and I was literally looking at the dessert menu for a solid 10 minutes trying to convince myself to order dessert because everything had been so good."
"After all of the hype I decided to meet some friends for dinner. Is it bad to say that I wasn't impressed? Libations were good (especially the Fortaleza Tequila), but the food was just okay for my tastes. I liked the dÃ©cor and the shared table setup and the service. The wait staff was very attentive have was helpful in giving recommendations. I'd like to go back but make it more of a date night versus a group outing."
"Does anyone even care about another glowing review of Girl & The Goat? Is there anything I can say that hasn't already been said? Probably not, but I'm giving my .02 anyway. I was completely prepared to be underwhelmed and once and for all give up on any Yelpinions about any ""hot"" restaurant. Well, my lovely Yelpers, you didn't let me down. Girl & the Goat is, in a word, magical. Me, Kyle H, and my boo had a really early reservation and it was virtually empty when we got there. Boo was feeding the meter, so the quad of hostesses made us wait to be seated until he came in. They kinda ignored us for a few minutes, chirping amongst themselves..thumbs down. While we were waiting we decided that the end of the bar was a better spot than a table, so we sat there, and it was the perfect location. The lounge area, as they call it, is open seating, so if you don't have a reservation and there's space you're set. By 5:15, though, it was filling up. The grub:Kohlrabi Salad: Really good, really hearty salad. I love kohlrabi and you don't see it often on menus. The fennel wasn't overpowering, which I think tends to happen a lot. Your dish winds up tasting like licorice, and that's DISGUSTING.Chickpeas Fritters: These were okay, they didn't blow us away. Kyle wanted to try them after several recommendations, but, they were kind of bland. I wouldn't get them again.Hiramasa Crudo: This was really yummy. the hiramasa is a very hearty white fish. It wasn't ""fishy"" at all. The sauce that's with it is perfect; light but really flavors the dish. The caper berries were sliced and gave it good texture and flavor. Escargot Ravioli: Holy Mary, mother of God. This was RIDICULOUSLY good. The sauce..omg! We were sopping it up with our bread, and I wanted to lick the bowl. I couldn't believe how absolutely delicious it was, and, I'm still thinking about it. It came with 4-5, maybe 6, ravioli pieces, and the boys let me have 2. Grilled Pork Ribs: Another ridiculously good dish, and I am going to go as far as to say that it might even be better than the pig face. Yes, I said it...better than the pig face. It comes with 4-5 really big, meaty, ribs that have the best most delicious seasoning on them; grilled scallion vinaigrette. The slaw is crisp and refreshing, and is the perfect complement to the ribs. I will get this every time I'm there that it's on the menu, which I pray and hope is all the time.Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face: I read about the pig face over and over & wasn't sure I could order it, because I thought it was going to be the actual face. I love bacon and pork, but, I don't want to be reminded of who donated the meat to me as I'm eating it, you know? It's not the entire face (thankthelord), but rather a patty of pork, that has been seared with a crunchy texture. It comes on a bed of potato sticks, and there's an egg on top, and the sauce. You are supposed to break the egg and mix everything together so that you get all of the flavors. We had a moment of silence at the table as we each took the first bite, and then proclaimed this the best version of pig ever created. Again, I will order this each and every time I'm there, but, I'm ordering a plate just for myself. That's right, I won't be sharing the pig face, and I would strongly caution anyone dining with me against pointing their fork in the direction of my plate. Goat Carpaccio Tongue: This was on the goat menu, and was good. I am a carpaccio fan, but, wasn't sure about goat tongue..it was good. It didn't taste any different than any other carpaccio, and had capers in addition to the smoked roe. Â SautÃ©ed Green Beans: This is a dish that was raved about by many, but, I don't understand why. I have to preface this by saying it was the last dish we had, so that may have colored my judgment, but, I didn't really like this. Well, it's not that I didn't like it, but, it wasn't anything fantastic. It's green beans with a really heavy sauce and cashews. I thought the sauce & cashews were too much, especially the cashews. Won't order again.We didn't have dessert. There were only 3 options, I think, and none of them looked interesting or intriguing, and quite frankly we were stuffed. Â Our waitress was telling us that it really is better to sit in the ""lounge"" area if you can, because they will tell people in the dining room that they have a certain amount of time to eat...really? I get that the place is way popular, and that they're always booked, but, given how long one has to wait to get a reservation, I think it's kinda lousy to put people on a timer. I'm going to always try to sit in the lounge and not worry about how long I've been stuffing my face with pork & goat.This place isn't hype, it isn't overrated. It's absolutely fantastic and I will go back every single chance I get. Just keep your paws away from my pig face."
"If there was any more buzz about the Girl and the Goat, it might as well be a bee. Make reservations. And still expect a wait. Ours was 30 minutes, which we spent by the bar. There's a decent cocktail menu with nothing too fancy. As a whisky drinker, I tried my hand at the old fashioned, a drink I don't normally like (too sweet). The drink was made with Maker's, and I came away impressed.Quickly, the service is quick but surprisingly unchatty, and you'll get multiple waiters bringing you your food. They take the time to explain the dish, which is nice. The decor makes the place extremely loud. And the complaints about the salt are perfectly valid; some of the dishes had too much of it.Overall, a very fantastic evening that left just a smidge to be desired.Our food menu:Corny Goat Cheese Mousse: very delicious, and the goat cheese was very subdued. Came with an awesome corn relish.Pan Fried Shishito Peppers: I thought this dish was fantastic, although every fourth pepper or so is overtly hot. The peppers are Parmesan crusted-ish, which is awesome.Chickpea Fritters: Another solid use of the fried with the vegetable. Perfectly complemented by the sourness of the tomatoes.Roasted Cauliflower: My favorite dish. Amazingly seasoned; the menu says pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. I'm not sure if it actually tastes like it sounds, but it tastes fantastic.Seared Flounder: My favorite fish dish. Light and refreshing, almost like a sashimi dish from a trendy sushi place like Uchi in Austin.Sauteed Skate: Good combination of ingredients, but the salt is clearly evident.Hiramasa Crudo: Nice enough to put the crispy pork belly on the side to accommodate the non-pork eaters. The dish came with caperberries, although I'm still not sure what caperberries taste like.Pan Roasted Chicken: Way too salty. The chicken itself tasted great, but was smothered in a salt sauce with a side of black bean. The watermelon doesn't add anything to dishes like these; I'm not sure why that's a growing trend in fancy restaurants.I can't seem to find the dessert menu online to remember what we got, only I remember they're not good. The dessert dishes are a blend of sweet and salty, and that's not a combination that's up my alley. I took a bite of each and passed.Overall, I preferred the vegetarian dishes, especially the cauliflower, and was pleased with the fish dishes. I would have liked to try one of the goat dishes, but that was against the wishes of the table.It's trendy, it's popular, it's saltily delicious. But it feels a little too much of each. Combined with the longer than expected wait (no free appetizer or drink comp at least?), and it doesn't quick reach the 5* mark."
"This place is genius. Can't think of anywhere I've been to in years that has this kind of flavor and inventiveness at an affordable (aka non Michelin 3 star) price. Since you're going to come here anyways God willing, I will rate dishes (on a Yelp 5 star scale):5 - scallop - I didn't think the seafood here would be so good. This was a couple of huge scallops that were perfectly cooked and had the most char I've seen on a bivalve. Accoutrements underneath were equally fantastic. Scallops r usually boring with no flavor - these were different. 5 - Skate fish. Another brilliant seafood surprise. Hard to describe all the components on the plate but it all melded together well. Collichio would be proud. 5 - goat belly (or whichever dish had lobster in it). Â There was a candy or cotton candy flavored hint to the lobster that made this Really intriguing to eat. Â Never tasted that combo of flavors before. A 6 star in my book. 5 - bread. Get it. Fresh, warm, amazing spread with some nuts in it were a perfect complement. 4 - pork ribs. This would be a 5 star rating at another restaurant as it is executed perfectly, insanely tender falling of bone. Nothing overly inventive here, so if you've had insanely good tender pork ribs before at a great Texas or Memphis bbq, this won't be substantially different. 4 - pig face Â This might also be a 5. But after 6 dishes btw 2 ppl I was basically full, and tipsy, so while still great, my palette had already died and gone to goat heaven. 4 - cauliflower. Roasted and good. But a veggie is a veggie is a veggie. My fav restaurant veggie would still be the roasted/seared Brussels sprouts that many restaurants do really well.4 - duck tongue. I love excellent beef tongue at many a yakitori place. Â This was probably not as good, speaking of the duck's tongue itself (which was not a few tender slabs, but rather a scattering of bits of fried duck tongue). Of course the other components on the plate turned it into still a great dish, but standalone duck tongue didn't wow me. Fun tho to try. 7 dishes is def more than enough for two guys. Wish we saved room for dessert. No man-date is complete without dessert. Cocktails were fantastic - i could describe them, but just ask your server as his recs were spot on for my prefs. 3 month reservation is just insane! Instead we just came in on a Saturday at 6pm, put our names down and the wait was quoted a couple hours for 2 ppl (small percentage of tables r reserved for walk-ins). An hour and a half later they offered us a table but told us they'd need it back by 9pm. So while we were rushed as 9 approached, I was not upset. We didn't finish all bits and drinks until 920pm, but i figure if the other couple waited 3 months for their reso, what's another 20 minutes riiight? :) Â Or come at 430pm when they open. Prolly my new fav resto in Chicago. Will try to make it back again soon if someone's willing to wait a couple hours for a walk-up reservation."
"Phone service - RUDE Host/hostess - arrogant, snobbish and rude Drinks - a gilet has 3 part vodka or gin lime juice (FRESH) sugar syrup DO NOT sent out a ""gimlet"" with only vodka and lime juice - that is NOT a gimlet! Waitress - Great Food Octopus - could have been far more tender goat empanadas - with all the tzatziki and garlic in the tzatziki you could have put my shoe in the empanada, it was taste but no goat flavor scollops - nice dish, the mushrooms on the bottom were pretty amazing Cauliflower - very tasty Kalbi beef ribs - awful, have you ever had koren food? Just take it off your menu...this was just a terribly composed and prepared dish...possibly one of the worst in my life dessert PB & J Â - umm...change your oil - the fried ""balls"" greasy and taste of old dirty oil Peach like cobbles - nice flavor but NO TEXTURE! It wasnt a bad meal, but NOTHING to run back for"
"No big deal. I'm sure all the hype kept my expectations high for this place but after the experience I'd rather have spent my precious calories elsewhere. Got the recommended yelp dishes but again, no big deal. The most enjoyable part of dinner was the beer my group had but what's quality beer with mediocre food and over $50 per person? Chicago has much more to offer."
Everything is great! Very different flavors and ingredients. Our server Lindsay was super friendly.
"I think we tried nearly everything on the menu - breads, veggies, meats, desserts - everything was ridiculously good. Here are the highlights for me:1) Pig Face - I promise you, you have never tasted anything this good. It's out of this world.2) Green Beans - Another promise, you have never ate a vegetable that tastes this good (or is probably this unhealthy!)3) Breads - All were terrific, had great sauces, and were cheap. 4) The Service - AMAZING. Our waiter could not have done a better job. He knew the menu perfectly, was courteous, and his timing was right on point.5) Ms. Izard was there that night - it was a pleasure to see a celebrity chef actually working the kitchen. I've been to a few big name restaurants and the centerhead is nowhere to be seen. Overall, I had extremely high expectations and it surpassed them all. It climbed to the top of my favorite restaurant list and I don't see that changing anytime soon. Well done G&tG!"
"First tapas experience, and it's pretty much exactly what I heard - expensive appetizers. Tried 5 dishes, of which none really stood out... except for the shashito peppers, which stood out negatively as overly seasoned, marinated in cheese sauce.To boot, parking is a pain in the butt."
"I can say each individual flavor in each individual dish stands alone. The food is frickin amazing! I went with my boyfriend as a last minute dinner date. Initially the hostess told us to have a seat in the lounge, which we could still order from since we didnt have a reservation. 10 minutes after we sat down a table became available at the best seats in the house. I could see my food being prepared which further helped me appreciate the flavor and I could still have an intimate dinner with my sexy significant other. Sexy staff, sexy food, and hella sexy guests. They did, however, run out of goat shank, but I will go back and try it the next time. I'm sure it was phenomenal."
"Wonderful, stellar, deliciously creative dishes. Â  However the manager was unbelievably rude and condescending to us, which spoiled the whole dining experience. Â  Â I hope this place improves their customer service and doesn't become arrogant simply because of hard-to-get reservations. Â  Go here for the food if you're a foodie but be prepared to be annoyed by the manager and his attitude."
"If I could, I would give her 10 stars!!I've eaten at the restaurants of other Top Chef contestants before, but after our group of 4 had dinner at Girl and the Goat I understand 100% why Stephanie beat them all out to win Season 4 of Top Chef. She. Is. A. Freaking. GOD!!!The ambiance was rustic but hip. The server was very nice but had a personality. And the food was out of this world AMAZING. I'm always complaining that nice restaurants have good food but it's never anything different - every single dish at Girl and the Goat was innovative, creative and most importantly, freaking delicious.We got:-Fat bread: bread with liver butter and plum compote-Raw oysters-Pan roasted Barramundi-Seared scallops with killer brussel sprouts-Lamb stuffed calamari - MY FAVORITE!-Braised beef tongue-Roasted cauliflower-Pig face!!-Fudgesicle with beer-Donut nibsI swear this never happens but I loved EVERY single thing that came out! Even better, between 4 of us we ordered all this food + 2 bottles of wine and the total came out to about ~$50 a person! It's a good thing I don't live in Chicago because I'm pretty sure I would move in to live with the girl and the goat and we would live a very happy, fat life together!Make your reservation today and get ready for the best meal you will ever have in your life!"
"After watching Top Chef and hearing about this place for AGES, I finally managed to randomly get a reservation a few days in advance. Â I had pretty high expectations, and I'm happy to say that they were met.We ordered 4 dishes between 2 people. Â We got the goat empanadas, peppers, scallops, and pig face. Â I would have given this place 5 stars were some of the dishes a little less heavy. Â Everything we ordered felt very heavy, especially the peppers. Â It was good, don't get me wrong...but I did walk away feeling like there was a bundle of delicious sauces and grease in my stomach. Â I think maybe the waitress could have recommended us some lighter dishes to balance out what we ordered.All in all though, it was really good. Â The corn gelato desert we got was WONDERFUL. Â I'd go back for that alone. Â Was it worth the the hype though? No, but only because the hype is so huge. Â I'd go back again, but I wouldn't really stress about waiting months in advance."
"Wow, G&G was still buzzing at 10PM on a weeknight! Â This restaurant was the only one still alive on Randolph/Halsted. Â Make reservations for at least a week in advance... maybe even 2.Things I appreciated about G&G:- 2 long areas by the bar for standing and sitting- tables were long enough to fit dishes in the center w/o crowding your individual eating space- open kitchen window (for those who are trying to catch a glimpse of Stephanie)- our waiter Tony, who was genuinely happy to be serving us; has a great attitude and was extremely upbeat- menu is thoughtful (broken up by breads, veggies, seafood, and animals; then when read from top to bottom, it indicates lighter dishes to heavier dishes)I loved half the dishes I tried (~12 dishes). Â What I appreciate about the food is that each dish has complex flavors, textures, and colors. The highlights & low lights:HIGHLIGHTS1) sauteed skate w/grilled calamari (a must for seafood lovers!)2) hiramasa crudo (yellowtail sashimi, pork belly, and a tiny toast)3) fried oysters (so lightly battered, I could eat several plates of these by itself)4) veal t-bone (especially loved the crunchy mushrooms & brussels sprouts - could be a meal in itself for 1 person)5) goat/pork/veal sugo (like a very sophisticated spaghetti w/meat sauce)LOW LIGHTS:1) pig face (almost half was fat, and the black mush in the middle is tongue; I tried but couldn't like it)2) goat & ricotta pizza (crust was burnt, and another ingredient made this a little too bitter overall)3) scallops w/braised veal (scallops were perfect, but the braised veal was swimming in a broth that made it lose flavor)Getting about 3 dishes/pp to share with your entire table will probably cost you around $50/pp, +/- $10."
"This has been the most amazing meal I've had in Chicago and possibly in my entire life...I think the number of reviews and average rating says it all. Â I had high expectations coming in, and I was not left disappointed. For 2 people, we ordered the following which was the perfect amount for those with big appetites:- Duck butter with blackberry jam- Roasted beets- Baby grilled octopus- Something with lobster (yea, I've got short-term memory issues lol) - Pig faceI would recommend all of the dishes we had. Â Service was superb, pricing was fairly reasonable for such a highly-acclaimed restaurant, and the atmosphere was a lot more casual than I expected. Â It seemed to attract a diverse crowd (yuppies, hipsters, etc.), which I really appreciated."
"Not that this place needs any more awesome reviews, but I love it, and I can't wait to go back.The cauliflower IS that good. The wine selection is great. Our server was very helpful with both our wine and food selections. My only complaint: it's SO NOISY."
"Food was fabulous! Â We had a wonderful waiter. Â We ordered the hamachi (excellent), halibut (unbelievable) and pig face (good as well but we were stuffed so we couldn't finish). Also highly recommended is the green beans. Â  We could have done without the cauliflower and bread. Â We also ordered Sogu which everyone loved (no beef for me thanks!). Â  That's 6 dishes and bread between the 3 of us and we couldn't finish 2 dishes. Â TIP: Â ask for the pig face as first/early course."
"It was expensive for food that was just OK. The experience is cool, if you're into that kind of thing, I guess. I'm not sure I am. It's really crowded, loud and trendy. A see-and-be-seen scene.I do like sharing small plates. This is that kind of place. But there were a lot of plates that left me ambivalent.I didn't like the fried oysters (kind of tasted like a mcfish); I didn't like the sweet potato gratin (extremely salty with funions on top); I didn't like the red fish (really fishy, too salty). I did like the chickpea fritters and the seppia. The space is a nice mix of industrial and warm. Our server, Greg, was great: funny, sweet and knowledgeable. He gets props. But overall, it just seemed needlessly pricey, overly trendy, and just too effin bougie, without the mind-blowing food to back it up."
"I might be one of the last ones in Chicago to try this restaurant, and after 1000+ reviews, I still want to put in my 2 cents. I am not sure why I waited sooo long to try out this place. I have to admit - I am a Top Chef fan and loved Stepanie Izard in her season. My expectations were sky high when I walked in. My husband and I were seated promptly for our 8:30pm reservations. Our server was very good and explained the menu to us. My husband is a vegetarian and we were very happy note that at least one third of menu was vegetarian friendly.The chick pea fritters were outstanding. The roasted cauliflower was good too ... but it was a tad too salty for us. I ordered the diver scallops - they were brilliant, for some reason I imagined myself sitting in Goa (India) and eating sea food by the beach. Yum!! Then we ordered the pizza (flatbread) - this was not that great. We did not like it much. It was a little too greasy and a little too salty and the cheese had kind of congealed and there were really no stand out flavors. It is a great place with a laid back, fun and casual ambiance - the food was great with a few flashes of brilliance (chick pea fritters and scallops) but the pizza fell flat."
"We went there the other day when we were in the area. It was a long wait so we ate in the lounge area.We tried the tempura crab, goat empanadas, goat cheese tortellini, and pork ribs. Every item was outstanding. I would have liked to have tried the grilled octopus but my fiance has allergies to pistachios, which are on it so we had to pass. BOOOOOOO!!!We also had the chocolate cake for dessert which was very rich and very good. They have a pretty unique menu which has many items that look very appealing. I cant wait to go back and try some of the other items."
"Pretty darn good! Â We made a reservation 3 months in advance, and I'm not sure it was worth THAT kind of wait. Â But in all fairness we did enjoy every bite.Food we had: Chickpea fritters, green beans, pork ribs, scallops, and pig face.'What we thought: Â We loved everything, except the pig face. Â This was not due to the quality or deliciousness of the dish, but to the mental barriers we needed to overcome about eating a pig's face.Service: EXCELLENT!!Atmosphere: I was actually surprised by this...there were empty tables and it felt a lot more low key than I had expected for a place with a 3 month wait! Â But I will take a gourmet meal in a laid back environment anytime.Overall: Â I liked it and would probably go back should someone suggest it or I have a hankering for pig face. Â :)"
"I""m sorry I cant see what the hype was about this place. Maybe I came on an off day I'm not sure but out of the 6-7 dishes I had/tasted only 3 were really good. We had a reservation for a Saturday night at around 9:30pm so of course the place was jam packed. Since we were there an hour early we decided to hang out at the bar and wait our turn. First thing that I noticed walking in is that this place is LOUD so loud in fact that you couldn't hear the music they were playing. The second thing was that it felt like I was at one of those 30 something nightclubs/bars. I noticed a lot of single women in groups which I thought Â was just a little strange but then again it was a Saturday night. So lets get to the food which is why we came here for in the first place. Since its a small plate service we decided to get around 6 dishes and a desert. Â We ordered the followingChickpeas fritters . eggplant-tomatillo caponata . crave brother's mozzarellaSauteed skate . sunchoke . ruby red grapefruit . olive . crisp lentilsGoat EmpanadasPig Face Hiramasa CrudoChocolate dessert.I thought the Goat Empanadas were the stars of our meal, It was just so delicious and the meat was very tender and the sauce they were laid on was excellent, I could of ate those all night. The second dish I felt was very good was the pig face, it was just so crispy and very tasty and was paired perfectly with the fried egg. We also ordered the home made bread which was so good especially with the blue cheese butter spread it came with. Finally we had this incredible dessert with chocolate cake and ice cream with a stout poured over it. Overall I enjoyed our meal but I didn't feel it that the whole meal together was outstanding. One more thing, the table service was amazing good, every other dish they brought out clean dishes to replace the ones we used they even replaced my napkin even though it wasn't even used."
"I really enjoyed my dinner here. The restaurant has a very rustic feel and we really had a nice time. The menu options that I didn't expect to like happened to be my favorite, like the cauliflower and the falafel. I'm not a huge meat eater but everything looked so good I just had to try it. Everything was cooked perfectly and the meat fell right off the bone. The only reason I gave Girl & The Goat 4 stars instead of 5 is because it took us 3 months to get a table here."
Simply the best around. Make sure you make a reservation well in advance or get there right at 4pm.
"This place gets a lot of hype and it lives up to it. I definitely thought that some items on the menu were better than others, but everything was flavorful and tasty. The server was good and recommended we order 5-6 dishes per couple. This turned out being a ton of food and we asked her to hold off on one of the items (despite really wanting to try the last dish). There was simply no room left and the last thing I wanted was that uncomfortably full sensation that bodes poorly for any meal regardless of how tasty it was going down.I've never gone to dinner and made my next reservation to come back in the same night, but that's exactly what we did. Try it all and don't be picky."
"I was extremely impressed by the quality of food and service. Â The staff took great pride in the menu offerings, including their explanation of such. Â To start, I had the pork face. Â It sounds a bit odd, but was porcine heaven. Â A mix of shredded pork face, I guess, on a bed of shredded potatoes, with an egg sunny side up, and a few accompanying sauces on the plate. Â It was delish and melted in my mouth. Â Next, I tried the goat belly confit. Â Yes, goat belly confit if you can believe it. Â And, it was fantastic. Â The goat belly had somewhat of a pork belly flavor and consistency but even better, with fennel, bourbon butter (yes, you read right, bourbon butter) and last but not least lobster. Â It was one of the best, most mouth watering dishes that I have ever had. Â To finish, I had the goat cheese cheesecake with candied beets and some other yummy additions and you could taste the goat cheese and it was delicious.Congrats to the chef and her work of art of a restaurant and delicious menu. Â She is on the money."
"Mother pearl this place is good - ok negatives: be prepared to wait for 2 hrs if you don't have a reservation. With that being said this place is all that it's hyped up to be. Must haves : the octopus, the fries (yes I'm a health nut but these fries - I can live off). The goat belly - the grilled cauliflower - the short ribs. Yes I ate almost the entire menu. Also the 3 sheet drink or three something drink goes well with the meal. Top of my list of restaurants in Chicago"
"this restaurant always has a very long reservation line but trust me, it's very worth the waiting!we had mussels, goat liver, pig face and all of them are fantastic! the pig face, as claimed by the waiter, is a must-try while we also find the other two dishes excellent. the bread before dinner is also great! we were sooo stuffed and couldn't handle any dessert after dinner! after all, this is a wonderful place and we are going back!"
"One word: AMAZING. Â This place has it all! Â Wine, cuisine, service and atmosphere were all 5 star quality. Â The wine list is unreal and the sommelier knew what wine was all about. Â Fav dishes: Â pig face, sweet potato fries, and everything else I ordered. Â RSVP is hard to get, but it's worth it to come in, have a drink at the bar, people watch, then eat!"
"Love it. Â One of the best restaurants in Chicago. Â Great food, great service and nice atmosphere."
"Ok I am ridiculous. Â If you could stalk a restaurant I would have a restraining order against me! Â Was only in Chi-town for the weekend and knew I wanted to get in here so I OpenTable and phone stalked for a reservation. Â Finally got one at 11:30pm which was pretty late for dinner but hey I took what I could get!As soon as you walk into the restaurant you are like....YES! Â Music was a fantastically eclectic blend of old school soul which puts you right in the mood. Â The restaurant is actually a lot bigger than it looks from the outside which puzzled me since I figured a place so hard to get in to must be in someone's backyard for god's sake.Then I took a look at the menu and it all became clear. Â You ever look at an entire section of a menu that was only vegetables and say I want everything? Â Yeah, me neither until I came to the Girl & the Goat. Â The cauliflower is slap yo momma good and the beet salad had ingredients so perfectly harmonious it was a salad symphony. Â Ok, maybe I'm exaggerating a bit but it was flawless so just roll with it.We also had a fish dish over veggies and two desserts but to be honest you don't really even need to know about them. Â Just go, point at anything randomly and be prepared to have the freakin' culinary experience you waited all that time for."
Excellent place to dine-out when you are in Chicago. I first followed a friend's suggestion to try out the place. I was not disappointed. The inside decor is great and the stuff is helpful. The menu is compact and the food is great! The bar also has a comprehensive selection of liqueur and wine. A personal suggestion: try to get a seat directly at the kitchen. You will have an unique connection with your food.
"Top Chef Izard, meet my Iron Chef-style review:Taste: 7/10Some of the flavors were amazing and unexpected in a good way, like the grapefruit that garnished my artichoke dish. Others sounded like they could have been winners but made for a strange combination on the palate - - goat and lobster pasta, where did your sickly sweetness come from!?Plating: 4/5White plates, square small plates to let you take advantage of the tapas-style servings, some sauces flared all over in fancy shmears. Nothing mind-blowing, but well-done.Originality: 5/5It's the combination of unexpected ingredients (see Taste section) that won me over. For example, dessert consisted of a moist cranberry-orange cake dessert topped with candied ginger, ginger whipped cream, and sorbet. I thought the pig face would be disgusting, but took a bite at my boyfriend's insistence and was surprised (see a trend here?) at its flavor and tenderness. The reason this fine establishment gets only 2 stars has nothing to do with the food - it's the experience. Minus one star for each of the following:- We came without a reservation (rookies, I know) and waited over 2 hours for a table on a Saturday night. We were originally told by the host that we could expect a 90 minute wait; it's reasonable to be off in your estimate, especially given the business of Saturdays in general, but a 40+ minute difference is a bit outrageous. That's an additional 40 minutes I could have spent at the bar across the street. And then the food was good, but not really worth the ginormous wait.- It's as busy as an anthill inside. There are about 5000 Girl & the Goat staff wearing black tees hustling around. Every time you finish a dish, somebody whisks your plate away and sets a new one down. By ""set,"" I mean place on your table extremely loudly and haphazardly, then scuttling away. The service felt really impersonal, especially since they kept setting down clean plates even after we were finished with our savory dishes. - Loud. As. Eff. I felt like I was in a club, not a restaurant. The focus seemed to be on the atmosphere rather than the food, and since I came here for the food, I was not pleased. I did not appreciate Jay Sean asking me Baby are you down, down down down down at like 800 decibels. No, not down.Girl and the Goat, I really wanted to like you. Tone down the music, get your waitstaff to stop clanging their plates, and I'd love to come back."
"The Girl and the Goat is a place that is difficult to get into and it has a lot of hype around it ... well, it there is a good reason for it!My husband and I went to the Girl and the Goat for our 1yr anniversary and enjoyed the entire experience. Our table was not ready when we arrived, so we decided to take a seat at the bar and order a drink. The bartender was very friendly and provided great service. I ordered a glass of red wine, and it was served at perfect temperature, which is not always the case when you order a glass. The food is phenomenal and the atmosphere is non-pretentious and fun.My only complaint was that our server wasn't very engaging - she was ""okay"", but we found ourselves trying to flag her down a couple of times as she barely came to check up on us. If she was more attentive, she most likely would of gotten another drink order out of us. At a higher-end place, one expects good service. Regardless of our experience with our server, we will definitely return!"
"Wow, Girl & the Goat Â totally lives up its rightful hype. We didn't have reservations but went at 9:30pm and was seated at one of the two community tables. The place was much much larger than I thought and it had a very flowing layout. The atmosphere was great and our waiter was super Friendly and helpful. We ordered four items (we were recommend to get six) and all were delicious. We started with the speck wheat bread with butter and honeycomb. Â Since I was a vegetarian, the waiter got me a butter without bacon (which is what comes with the speck bread. This is a pretty good vegetarian friendly place and the waiter knows the menu and makes good suggestions and steers one towards the right foods. Â The artichokes we got came in a sauce which was a delight to eat. We also got the mushroom raugout ravioli and the chickpea fritter w hummus. Â I also got the Aviator cocktail, which was made extremely well (and the only other time I had it was at Spring, which has shut its doors) After those four plates, we were stuffed (The ravioli put us over the top), but we got a dessert - Â flourless chocolate cake with shitake gelato. Yum. The gelato is from black dog, one of my favorite places and worked mostly well with the flourless chocolate cake. Â On some bites, I felt the chocolate cake was a bit stronger flavor than the gelato, mostly due to it be flourless, but overall, I enjoyed the dessert.Will be back again."
Uh-mazing!!! Fabulous food- the wontons and goat empanadas were out of this world. Â Great service too. Visiting from San Diego but will come back just for this place!
"The Girl and the Goat. Hmm . . . funny name but there is nothing funny about this place! Â  In all seriousness- it is named after a painting that the owner has of- you guessed it- a girl and a goat. Â Look around- the painting is actually in the restaurant.What a terrific addition to the West Loop. This new hot spot (they had 3000 reservations on the first day they opened) has a celeb chef- none other than Stephanie Izard who won Top Chef two seasons ago. And she is poised for success as her business partners on this venture are some reliable restaurateurs in Chicago who own Boka, Perennial and Landmark. The old warehouse space is large and is like being in a huge urban loft with exposed brick walls, charred looking timbers, wood floors, and ironwork on the back bar that I would like to have in my home. There is a small lounge up front with sofas and tables and two chefs tables facing the open kitchen in the back. Here's a tip- if you can't get a table in the near term- go and sit at the bar and eat. There are easily 20 seats at the bar. And I have it on good authority that there will be outdoor seating on Randolph very soon.At this writing, the restaurant had been open for only a week, yet most of the slips you find in new restaurants open for so short a time were not present. The food was timed beautifully, the menu was not just explained by our server- it was loved, adored and marketed to us (thanks Lisa), and even the host staff went out of their way (one dark haired woman especially) to make us feel welcome and encouraged to come back. Even though it was a week night- the place was packed and there were plenty of people sitting up front waiting to get a table. We ordered a few of their signature drinks and began to read the menu. Our server suggested two plates per person to share and offered up several of her favorites from the menu. Interesting to note that they charge for the bread here ($4) but deliciously worth every penny. We had a crunchy loaf with onion butter on the night we were there that was so good we wanted to order two. But we didn't. We needed to save room for the real show of the night . . .the food! We started with 3 different types of oysters . Trust me- the fried ones with the egg salad will knock your socks off, as will the ones with red mignonette. I'd forego the aioli ones if you have a choice. Nightly there are three different kinds of oysters with different toppings. Next up- the most amazing green beans I have ever had-tangy, with cashews this was one of our table's favorite dishes of the night. My favorite was the soft shell crab served over corn with lime and chili aioli. Fabulous! Probably in the top three soft shell crabs I've had- and I've had plenty! We also had the Hiramasa crudo- with fried pork belly, the skate wing with grilled calamari, scallops served with braised veal and the crispy pigs face (sort of like pigs cheeks rolled around the pigs tongue and deep fried). Really amazing food with some interesting combinations. The only let down of the night were the scallops as they had been over salted. Our server volunteered to replace it but we were so full it didn't really matter. But of course we had to have dessert so we ordered a couple to share. Interestingly enough- Stephanie is doing the desserts with the same flair for mixing flavors as the main dishes so the desserts were unusual as well. We had the fudgescicle (you never have had anything like this-sort of a deconstructed thing with chocolate, stout, olive oil and something unexpectedly crunchy) and these sort of beignet type things served over Greek yogurt with figs. Terrific! If you drive- there is valet parking out front for $10 or you can probably find parking on one of the side streets, Dinner for three with many of their signature drinks (each at $11) was reasonable- about $250 all in. I also learned that they are opening up more reservations so if you haven't been able to get in- call and try again. Funny name? You bet. But I bet any jokes about the name will be quickly quelled the second you put that first bite into your mouth. For there is nothing funny about amazing food, served in a beautiful space, by people who love what they do. Check out the Goat!"
"I waited soooooo long to come to Girl and the Goat and it was worth the wait. After watching Stephanie on Top Chef, I was so excited about her restaurant, but I like waiting for restaurants to ""work out the kinks"" before visiting, so I waited - then realized it takes 2 months to get a good reservation! Tick tock tick tock... finally the day came. I was beside myself.Ambiance: 9 out of 10. I love all of the rustic touches. The open kitchen is super-cool. The only thing I thought was a little weird was the microfiber benches. I don't know why - just not a big fan. And I had to sit on a crease, which wasn't super-comfy. Oh, and the stemless wine glasses are hard to handle, especially with greasy fingers!Service: 10. We had Antonio / Tony. He was so awesome - great personality, helpful, just ""on it"". Food: 8. Pretzel bread with thousand island dressing dip or honey mustard dip - Yes! Order it. So good!Pan fried shishito peppers - so good! Had just enough heat and it was a generous portion. Love.Shrimp ceviche - maybe a tiny bit under-done, but really nice flavors.Empanadas - our favorite dish. Fantastic spices, just yum.Goat Ribs - came recommended, but I was not a fan. Too heavy, too greasy, too fatty. My boyfriend happily ate what I didn't :) He thought it was a little gamey, though, and we plan to try the pork ribs or the beef ribs next time. Gingerbread cake - very good, but seemed out of place on an 80-degree night. Seems more appropriate for the holidays. I actually said that it tasted like Christmas. Can't wait to come back and try other dishes!!!"
"Going Ga Ga for Goat! Goats, Goats, Everywhere! Goats, Goats are in my hair! Ok, they may not really be hanging in my hairdo, but they certainly are the premise du jour and adorably themed focus of the newly opened hot spot of yet another Top Chef alum, this time being one darling femme fatale, Stephanie Izard. I truly can not say a bad thing about Girl and the Goat, even on only its fourth evening open, this gastronomical wonder is running like a well oiled machine with every minute detail meticulously attended to. Hospitable, knowledgeable staff... Fast service with dishes being fired on the spot the moment your order leaves the table... Inventive, ubertasty, unique plates intended to be served in the best way possible, for sharing, natch... and then yummy cocktails + craft brews rounding out a flawlessly precise dining experience. Take a large, no holds barred meat-thusiastic group along for this goat ride if you can. Six at minimum are required - as we learned - to try almost one of everything (there are approx 30 plates in total) and send yourself into a goat induced gluttony utopia. Be sure not to miss out on the utterly intimidating, but absolutely impressive dish called 'Crispy Pig's Face'... it is absolutely what you think it is with an addition of pig's tongue, chimichurri, arugula and daikon thrown in for an orgasmic amalgamation of herbaceous + fried + peppery + citrusy + salty goodness that can only be tried to be believed. Expect more loveliness to be found in the likes of a beautiful shaved kohlrabi salad, ham frites replete with warm swiss for dipping, sweet corn blended with crunchy soft shell crab, seared scallops married to tenderly braised veal, pan roasted skate playfully paired with capers and chickpeas, a ricotta-heavy smoked goat pizzette and, our tables utmost favorite, the rabbit rillettes with crispy rice paper, ginger giardienere and the most sinful garlic jus to ever cross your luscious lips. Phe-fuckin-nomenal! Miss Izard ain't playing around. The word on the block is that GatG received over 3,000 calls for reservation requests on their first day open alone... you will have to crawl, clamor, beg and steal to get in here most likely, but the ends certainly merit the means aka they'll be worth their weight in goat. Bah Dum Dum! My big tip for the day is: show up after 9pm if you don't mind a later dinner, tables will be available (a few are intentionally left unreserved) and you should be golden. Welcome to Chicago, Goat, we're bahhh'd about you already!"
"given the number of reviews for this place and the difficulty with getting a reservation, i was expecting the food to be orgasmic...unfortunately, I was disappointed. Â the food was very fatty and while I LOVE bacon, there comes a point where too much fat just makes me feel sick. the portions were also small and the prices hefty. granted, some of the items we tried were good but I was just expecting a lot more from a place like this. the service was great though. our server was very friendly and attentive."
"IT'S WORTH THE WAIT!!!My husband took me here for a Valentine's Day surprise and boy was it a treat!The atmosphere is really cool. Dim lighting, indie music, nice decor.Let me move onto the food. Â They do small plates and recommend 2-3 per person, like tapas.We ordered based on what other Yelpers thought (Thank you Yelpers!!) and here are my thoughts:*Bread with Bleu Cheese Spread* - I don't know a restaurant where you had to pay for bread but this is definitely worth the $4. The spread is light and flulffy and oh so delightful and the bread was warm, soft and not dry. It was hard not to stuff myself with bread but I had to plan for what was to come.*Green Beans* - So delicous! My husband said these were the best green beans he ever had. They were sauteed in some sort of fish sauce and had a crunch. Yum!*Diver Scallops* - These are the bigger scallops. Seared, tender, not over cooked. Â Very delectable.*Pork Ribs* - The ribs were good tender, fall off the bone-ish just like I like it. No sauce but it was a bit on the salty side for me. Probably our least favorite dish but still good.*Pig face* - Boy did this hit the spot. Crunchy & crispy on the outside, moist in the inside cut of pork with an egg on top. So flavorful. I think it's a Girl & the Goat must.*Apple Donut Dessert*- I have a big sweet tooth so this did not really do the trick for me. The apple was a little on the sour side. It tastes good but I wanted it to be a little sweeter. I don't think it was the best apple dessert I ever had. I'm not going to lie, I kind of felt like Padma Lakshmi tasting and enjoying all of these fantastic dishes. Â After finally experiencing Girl and the Goat, I definitely agree that Stephanie Izard is a Top Chef!"
"Just wanted to let everyone know I've been here 3 times now because I'm so cool and popular.No but really, the pig face is phenomenal. As is the smoked duck fat butter. DUCK FAT!! SMOKED!!! BUTTER!!! I MADE SURE TO KEEP IT AFTER THE BREAD WAS GONE SO I COULD DIP EVERYTHING ELSE IN IT!!!!! THEN I DRANK THE REST!!!"
"I love the space and it is always quite lively. Â Though difficult to get a table, i hasd no problem grabbing a seat at the bar. Â Definitely not small plates as advertised. I ordered 3 myself and could barely eat any of the 3rd.1) Hiramasa crudo was fantastic. I would definitely order this again.2) The pork belly played well with the hamachi, so definitely a hit.3) As for the Pig face - the not so secret ingredient is the tamarind, which adds only a slight amount of sweetness, but combined with creme adds a unique richness. Â This dish is definitely not to be missed."
"The short review: Â Overpriced, mediocre bar food...in an overhyped, loud and cramped room. The long review: Â I can't believe this place has nearly a 5 star rating! Â  My boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday night and were told we would be seated in 45 mins...1.5+ hours later, we were still waiting in the lounge. Â  If we had known, we would have eaten in the lounge. It turns out that it would have been preferable to the little table we were sandwiched between the other tables where no conversation was private since we were practically sitting at the same table as the people on either side. Then...the food. Â First, the waitress was put off that we were only ordering three plates to share. Â She advised that it wouldn't be enough food, so we ordered one more dish. Turns out we had more food than we could eat and the food was mediocre at best, and way overpriced. Â  What a huge disappointment!I would not recommend and I won't be back."
"Next time someone tells me: nothing in life is perfect, I'd like to correct them and say: every rule has an exception. Perfection = Girl and the Goat. I cannot even begin to describe and admire the food, service, ambiance, drinks, experience - everything!!It's very vegetarian-friendly and while celebrity restaurants can be ""creative"" but make you feel overwhelmed, this one has perfect execution and while each dish is innovative, none of it feels mismatched or not smoothly blended. I celebrated my 25th birthday here last night and our server did a very good job explaining dishes, recommending wines, and highlighting best items to order! My friends loved the fish and I really liked everything I had - from the bread to the salad to the pasta. I won't go in-depth about each dish as the menu is quite dynamic, but needless to say, the food here is very well thought-out, experimented and executed. I can't recall the last time I gushed so much about a restaurant and really, this place is pure perfection!"
"Hate to say it, but stars are falling from the sky and not in a make a wish kinda way.I used to be obsessed. Effin' completely bonkers for this place. Â My experience around Christmas time left me feeling' ho-hum. Made reservations for my birthday and a friend of mines. Yes. We are unlucky souls who get screwed on gifts and such. boo-hoo. Â Anyways, we have a foursome. In the online reservation I state we have a birthday. When they call to confirm I say we have a birthday. When we arrive for our reservation I repeat we have a birthday. I think on deaf ears at this point. When seated, I whisper about a birthday saying we will pay extra for a bit of a surprise...I hear okay, no problem, okay every time. Service, meh. Not as good as usual. We order two breads. They are forgotten. When eventually reminded (after half of our food has arrived already) bread is brought. One of them is wrong. Â Ugh. Deep sigh. Re-request bread. Eventually, we are done eating. We are asked if we want dessert. We say no thank-you, as I already offered to pay and have dessert. Me thinks it's coming. It's not. Bill arrives. Oh, awkward moment for the birthday kiddies. So, I get my birthday butt up and ask about it. We are finally given desserts but the moment is gone and spoiled. I wasn't asking for a freeby by any means. But bummer when I gotta ask for a birthday cake for myself. Â  Basically, servers and staff just didn't rock it this time around. Â Bummer city. It's no longer my fav. Sad face."
"About two months ago we stumbled in G&TG on a Monday night and was able to grab a table without reservations. It was 10pm so I'm not completely surprised but that place was still packed as if the night was just beginning. We first went to the Goat in September of 2010 shortly after the opening but had not returned since (not the easiest place to get a table). My initial response was to question all the hype surrounding the place. I knew all the media attention and fame of Stephanie would bring customers for years but thought the food was inconsistent. I'm glad we were able to get a second opinion because the food this time around was impressive. We were not starving and did not order a ton of things - which is a bummer because I would have like to try more plates. All in all 95% of the dishes we did try were excellent with a few standouts (such as the fettuccine sugo and skate - didn't love the sweet potato casserole). The atmosphere still feels more River North and West Town but that's ok, the decor is cool and I really like the open kitchen view. Our service was also excellent and very attentive and happy to help us make decisions. I certainly would not call G&TG a value play and I was a little surprised at our bill with only 5 dishes, bread and one drink. If our first visit was worth 3.5 stars I now believe it deserves another star to 4.5. It's hard to recommend to people because of the advance planning and price point, but I'm officially on the band wagon and recommend a stop if at all possible. A quick food recap: Â we started with one of the warm bread selections with an apple spread and flavored butter of some kind - delicious. The skate came out second with the string beans and fries. Beans were not as good as first one but still a great dish. Skate was awesome, light and tasty but the fries (with powdered ham) were not my favorite but still tasty. I like my larger and piping hot without meat. The best dish was the pasta a and sugo bolognese. I'd go back for that alone and order 3. The least impressive dish was the sweet potato casserole au gratin. We were stuffed and didn't need the dish and loved the fettuccine so much that it was always going to be a touch comparison, but there was just a ton a cheese and thin slices of potato that were overwhelming and rich. There was no room for dessert unfortunately so that will have to happen on the next visit. I'd love to get back with a group of four so if anyone is interested let me know."
"If ever in the history of Chicago restauranteering had expectations ever been hoisted to its highest levels and followed through with flawless execution - this was it. Tonight I witnessed the birth of a new Chicago landmark so masterful in its flavor that words simply cannot express the degree to which the palate remains stimulated and satisfied. The degree of hospitality and creativity to which Girl and the Goat subscribes to can only be written in superlatives, best of lists, and Frommer's travel guides. When it's December and we reflect on Chicago's new hottest restaurant I have no doubts in my mind that Girl and the Goat will prevail!By bestowing Girl and the Goat with a magic goatcrown, I was given the privilege of being one of the first in Chicago to have a sneak peak at dinner at this fresh Randolph Street. Two other friends happened to get an invite to the friends and family dinner and I was a bit concerned we wouldn't be able to sit with each other. Problem solved - Girl and that Goat bended to our will and let us sit together. I came in with my own goatcrown on and they quickly took care of my heavy backpack and swooped and stashed my wine for later consumption.It was booming, it was bustling - a sound and scene I hope never to extinguish from its beautiful wooden interior. We were seated in front of the magnificent giant goat painting, eerily reminiscent of a Tim Burton movie. I noticed my napkin was held together by a small ring of paper with the ubiquitous goat imprinted on it. The menu too, marked by goat let me know this was the finest of goat establishments and we were racked with indecision on what to possibly order.The waitstaff displayed great personality and teamwork in loading our table with the maze of glasses for white and red wine and water. Our server had the enthusiastic personality of your favorite bartender and the sophistication of a sommelier. We oohed and we ahhed and went on an ordering blitz!Grilled baby octopus, green beans, beet salad, seared NY strip, seared fish, goat pizza, roasted chicken, beef tongue, scallop, crispy soft shell crab, and delicious fried pig made the top of the list and we ordered this in quick fashion. Our server stood by ready for our questions but there was a 100% chance that if we closed our eyes and selected our dishes by throwing darts that we would end up wholly satisfied.Never having to look at my wine or water glass, we waited as our glasses were magically replenished by the attentive staff. In short order the veggie dishes arrived. I must say that I detest salad and can think of no worse thing to eat but on first bite of my beet salad, I lifted my eyebrow in surprise and enjoyed a fully texturized and flavorful salad. Salad is supposed to be boring, but this salad already knocked my socks off with its crispiness and simple ingredients. The fried pork was uber crispy with a delicious sauce sending explosions of taste on my tongue. The seared scallop was so delicious, it would have been more suiting to take the whole bowl of braised veal and drink it all without sharing! Being that it is the civilized world, while such a move was veritably warranted, manners won the moment. In came grilled baby octopus with an array of nuts and beans. If you are a fan of subtle combinations of flavor along with high texture - rock the baby octopus!Roasted chicken featured watermelon! Watermelon!? Such subtle sweetness like a peck on the lips kissed me as the tender slivers of chicken were consumed. The other veggies on the dish gave the chicken an additional unanticipated freshness. That's what the best chefs are able to unlock and the pleasure was all mine to be in the presence of such excellent food. The nomgasm continued with seared fish in an aioli with fried potato chips. Tender on the inside and crispy on the out, the texture and flavors melted my heart away. We all agreed on how delicious fish was especially taking a bite out of Girl and the Goat's fish! Everyone's favorite far and away was the crispy soft shell crab coming straight from the Atlantic! We probably should have all ordered one per person with the beasting nature of the soft shell crab. Fried to a crispy exterior with waves of rich sauces no finer dish could be imagined. The seared NY strip had a flavorful crust while staying medium rare in the middle soaked in a delicious sauce and onions. I must admit, I gave up all hope of avoiding goat meat and jumped into the pizza and had a ball with the goat meat and goat cheese loaded up with veggies. Twas delicious and wholly worthwhile.Girl and the Goat is so wonderful in its taste that I had to sit back, put my fork down and just take it all in to savor all of the amazing flavors that came rushing at me. I am absolutely grateful and delighted that one of Chicago's brightest chefs has decided to anchor down and offer up an amazing array of tapas to whet the appetite and send our taste buds to the highest level of nirvana."
"Delicious! Be willing to try stuff that sounds funny here, well worth it! Your ice cream may be made from duck liver fat, instead of milk cream - but so what, it melts in your mouth! Stephanie has taken her concept to another level. We really enjoyed our experience and our meals!"
"I'm a newbie foodie. Naturally, then, I am making my way through the culinary delights of Chicago, one fantastic restaurant at a time. (next up: Schwa) But the process has been slow. Why? Because I keep making reservations at Girl and The Goat. Like, over and over again. I typically have one, if not 2, standing reservations. I've been.... 5 times? I've dined at both ends of the line (the chefs table) and there is a reason for this.Stephanie Izard and her staff are incredibly talented. I'm not going to tell you anything anyone else here hasn't already, I'll just list my favorite must-have dishes: (the menu does change a litle, here and there...) The crispy pig face is hands down my favorite dish on the entire menu. Ignore the name of this and order it. I have literally had dreams about this dish. I've eaten an entire plate of it by myself. It's embarrassing. Once you try it, you'll understand. I also love (*in no particular order)The green beans: Redonkulous. Not your average veg.The Chickpea fritters- YUM. Creamy, savory, perfection.Smoked Goat rillette empanadas- mmmmm.....epanadas. :)Goat Cheese tortellini- delishWood Fired Wiley Point Oysters- best choice of the 3....** My friend Greg's favorite dish was the Beef tongue, but it was too tough for me.Regardless, Sit down, trust your server, enjoy the Duran Duran and MGMT over the speakers, have a glass or 3 of wine, ORDER THE PIG FACE and then just go for whatever strikes your fancy. The fact is, you really can't order poorly here. Everything is good, its just that some are better than others, but that all depends on personal taste.Clearly, I will be back. and I know when.... I have a reso waiting, of course...."
"The most delicious food I ever had, the Crisp Braised Pork Shank!"
"Ah girl and the goat...how you surprised me with your flavorful dishes and lovely ambiance! With all the hype around this restaurant, I figured I'd wait until it died down a bit. Well, I got impatient and went anyway because it still isn't dying down! I am glad I did. Had an 830 reservation that I made about a month in advance. We didn't get sat until around 9 because the place was completely packed on a Tuesday night. The tables are EXTREMELY close to one another but it makes it that much easier to peek at what other tables have ordered. Ok on to the good stuff:1. roasted cauliflower - solid effort but difficult to make cauliflower exciting2. chickpeas fritters - great texture and flavors, a must!3. grilled baby octopus - BF liked this one4. lamb sausage stuffed calamari - yum, a really original dish, BF's favorite! 5. goat, pork and veal sugo - my favorite dish of the night, literally melts in your mouth! loved it!6. bourbon apples for dessert - also very original, a great way to end a meal and the bourbon makes you feel warm and cozy...or maybe it was the bottle of wine we had with dinner ; ) Either way, this is one of the best restaurant's I have been to period. It is absolutely worth eating a late or early dinner so make it out there!"
"""Whoa. Wait, whoa. Can we have one of everything please?"" was our reaction to the menu. I went Â with a group of four and they recommended 3-4 Â entrees per person since it was more tapas style. We went the distance and ordered 4 each for a total of 12. My favorites were the scallops, cauliflower, goat pizza, and the PiÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance, the pig face which was appropriately served at the end. They served them in an order that they thought would be appropriate which was nice of them. Service was incredibly attentive and warm and they made sure to explain each dish as well as ask for any food allergies, etc. Â Stellar food and I highly recommend it. Unfortunately we had no room for dessert, but Black Dog Gelato makes their gelato which I have had and it's great!Though we had these reservations for a month, we were only able to get a 4:30 time slot. Oh well. We had a fabulous time. The restaurant was great, not too formal, more warm and inviting, and the pricing was not bad for the experience we had. I would definitely love to go again. We were also told that Chef Stephanie was in the house planning a new menu. She is going to start a diner style restaurant called The Goat."
"Wow, believe the hype. I've been waiting all year to go, and it was every bit as good as i'd hoped... Â Real, rustic, & organic in every way, from the great unassuming table service to the warm cozy space itself, and of course the amazing, well balanced flavorful food.The food:It is all served tapas-style in small plates perfect for sharing. My date and I shared 4 dishes & dessert.- Chick Pea Fritters: great flavor that pops, dont forget the sauces & hummus on the bottom- Pan fried shishito peppers: pretty good, but compared to everything else it somehow seemed a bit bland- Frog Legs & escargot: delicious- Grilled baby octopus: AMAZING!! the flavors combine so well...- For dessert a bread pudding made with Bourbon apples: cranberry, miso marcona almond, maple fat gelato: nom nom nomI cant wait to try some of the other dishes like the soft shell crab, the pork, the goat pizza, the pan roasted red fish or chickenThe ambiance: Warm, rustic, earthy. Def not your typical cold, sterile ultra-mod place.The service: Attentive. Knowledgable. Unpretentious. The prices: very very reasonable for such great food.The good - all of the aboveThe bad - it is one of the tougher places in the city to get a table so you gotta plan ahead.Can't wait to go back......"
"Obviously, it goes without saying that the food at Girl and the Goat is unbelievable, but this review is specifically for our server Patrick. Â When greeting our table Patrick asked our table of 10, if anyone had any allergies, of which, I have two (dairy and gluten). Â After everyone ordered drinks, Patrick sat down next to me with the gluten free menu, crossing out any dish that could not be made without dairy, would not be worth eating without the dairy and writing on the menu any ingredients that should be omitted when ordered. Â With so many intolerances, I often feel like I might have one or two choices on the menu, but with Patrick's help, I felt like I had tons of options.Then, when each dish was brought out, he made sure that any side that contained gluten was put in a separate dish or that alternate sides were provided just for me without any gluten or dairy. Â Every single dish came with specific instructions. Â Even with a large party of 10 sitting at our table, I felt like I had my own personal server who was specifically looking out for my needs. Â Not only was it an amazing experience because of the food, but I felt so well taken care of by Patrick who was wonderfully knowledgable about each dish and an over all caring and attentive server. Â I would go back just for that service!"
The Purple Pig is better
"OVERALL: (1) brilliant design, (2) eclectic menu of delicious food, & (3) face time with an excitingly famous chef. Â I'm a bit more than ""a fan"" as the four stars rates, but there's still work to get a five from me (see plate reviews below).A mere two blocks from my friend's apartment, he called and picked up a seat the fourth night they were open at 9 PM. Â Six of us briefly enjoyed the spacious waiting area and our first yeasty beverage of the evening. Â We were seated quickly (one of the two large tables by the open kitchen), and I chose a chair facing the kitchen staff and Stephanie Izard.Our humorous waiter, Meadows (David on the receipt), was everything you wanted in a server. Â He truly made us feel like this was a special event and was excited about every dish! Â He even asked us if anyone had allergies, which one did, before we began ordering. Â After some quick math we found it worth while to order one of everything (OOE, baby!). Â Not only did this take our waiter by surprise, but granted us some face time with the chef and two co-owners/investors as the evening went on.MENU HIGHLIGHTS(V) Vegetables:***Chilled Sweet Onion Soup - while very little is offered, I found it quick, delicious, and worth repeating!*****Sauteed Green Beans - WHY has no one mentioned this phenomenal side? Â I SO want to replicate this at home (and pretty much hoarded it from my friends).*Roasted Cauliflower - Blah...worth skipping.****Roasted Beets - I enjoyed this salad, but another West Loop restaurant has a much better one with mascarpone.(F) Seafood:*****Hiramasa Crudo - Uh, YUM!!! Â I know the pork belly wasn't supposed to be the center of this dish, but...score!****Crisp Soft Shell Crab - I've been to many places (even on the east coast) where the crab shell is supposed to be edible, but is chewy and tough to swallow. Â Stephanie's dish has no issues with that and is perfectly accompanied.****Seared Scallops - Oh yeah; scallops perfectly cooked.**Wood Fired Escargot - I was surprised that one of my favorite tapas entrees was barely noticeable in this offering.(M) Meat****Pork Liver Mouseline - Lets just say that the bus boy tried to part my friend with the cup of mouseline and he snatched it off the plate to keep for other dishes!***Ham Frites - While I don't exactly go to a high class restaurant to eat fries, these reminded me that even street food can be high class if done right.**Smoked Goat Pizza - I'm a huge fan off all types of pizza, but I really was indifferent about this one. Â I know I'm in the minority, so your choice.*****Skirt Steak a la Plancha - Need some tasty, well seasoned beef in all of this? Â Done!**Crispy Pig Face - It wasn't the title that made me dislike it, I LOVE all things pork, but it really didn't give me a unique flavor and doesn't live up to the hype.****Grilled Lamb Ribs - I wish baby sheep weren't so damn tasty!The amount of food, however, was too much...even for six hungry guys (I would recommend a group of 8 if trying OOE again)! Â The bill, on the bright side, was not! Â One of everything (30 if including the bread and three oyster starters) +two rounds of beer +desserts (two of each) = $550. Â Two hours later we tipped Meadows (very well), took a group shot with the chef, and rolled out raving about our evening.Visit Girl & the Goat, people, amazing food for the right price."
"place to go if you want to impress a date. Most menu items has pork and I dont eat pork. However our server was very informative and pretty much had a pen ready to scratch out anything with pork. yep, wiped out more than half the items lol. The food is very fresh nevertheless. tip: check open table randomly a day or two before in advance in case you did not make the 3 month cut!"
"I walked in to the Girl and the Goat with a group of friends and without a reservation at 9pm on a Saturday night and somehow managed to get a table immediately. Unfortunately, this ended up being the highlight of our dinner. As our server was sitting us down at our table, he combined our table with the table of a couple who looked like they were having a date without even having the decency to ask them if that would be ok! They looked extremely upset and spent the rest of their time there sitting very awkwardly with me and my friends at the same table. Note that this is not a restaurant with communal seating, so this seating arrangement was completely unneccessary. We both had separate tables so there was absolutely no need to combine them.If you are a vegetarian and you are looking for good food, don't even bother going here. This is the first restaurant I have been to where the items marked as ""vegetarian"" in the menu had anchovies and fish sauce in them! To be fair, my carnivorous friends did enjoy their food. Unfortunately though, the portions are so small that you can keep ordering all night and the food will still not fill you up. Note that I am a light eater. We ended the night by walking out hungry and our wallets considerably lighter, and we walked straight to the nearest late night pizza place to fill us up! I know I am going against the general trend here but overall, it was a very disappointing experience and I won't be going back. The only thing that makes me happy is that I did not have to wait 2 hours to get a table to find out how disappointing the experience was."
"I went to GATG tonight and here are my impressions.The good: tortone bread, sesame peppers, and the cocktails.The average: goat marsala pizza; goat & pork belly sugo; pork-fat doughnuts (the doughnuts were good but the accompanying ice cream, not so much); and the skate (actually slightly below average but I'll save my venom for the bourbon apples).The horrible: bourbon apples -- I actually wanted to spit it out. Â Ew! Â That was by far the worst dessert I've ever had. Â The restaurant would've gotten 3 stars but for the bourbon apples. Â It's a cute space and the food is generally fine but it comes with a hefty price tag and overall not worth it."
"1 hour wait to eat inside or immediate seating outside. It was over 90 degrees but IMO it was worth the heat...until I started to sweat and people at the communal table were swearing up a storm about how they should have patio umbrellas to at least block the sun. When the food came everyone started to quiet down except for the occasional ""its hot as hell"" comment in-between bites. As everyone already said, the food is good. HOWEVER, I thought that all the dishes were on the salty side. Lucky for me the cocktails to wash it down were delicious!"
"Finally got a reservation.Lived up to all the hype that everyone has been talking about. Great menu selection and loved how it was family style, we were almost able to try everything on the menu! Each dish was uniquely flavorful. Â Even the specialty butter was to die for!! You must order the ham frittes."
"Listen, the Girl & the Goat has 4.5 stars after 1400+ reviews...that's not only awesome, it's accurate. Yea, it's gotten a lot of hype, but its definitely deserving of it. I've been to G&G more times than I can remember with various people, and their greatest strength? Consistency. Yea, the menu changes. Yea, ingredients in dishes change. But the quality is always consistently great. The taste is consistently amazing. The service is consistently friendly. Unfortunately, the wait is also consistently long. But during the week, I haven't had much issue walking in around 9pm and having a table ready within an hour. Not bad, but I don't recommend trying that on a Fri/Sat for obvious reasons.My favorites have been the green beans, pig face, and goat belly confit with lobster & crab. Always get a bread. Yea, you pay for bread service at the Goat, but it's worth it for the warm, pillowy bread and the unique savory and sweet spreads they've got going on. Check for reservations often online, and you'll probably get lucky. Otherwise, book a table a few months in advance and you'll be glad you did."
"Food: Small menu but a good amount of variety. Everything we had tasted great.Ambiance: Really upbeat and fun restaurant, everyone is so friendly including the fellow diners.Service: We snuck in last minute and didn't want to wait three hours for a table so we sat at the bar. Elisa and Austin were really nice and made great suggestions.Price: Pricey for small plates but worth it.Overall: Great restaurant for a nice meal and a fun time."
"The menu has groups that you are able to order from, the portions are small, so you pick a couple in each section for a group. Â The atmosphere is amazing, I was expecting something small and quaint, but it is more polished and trendy.The food is good. Â Gotta make sure to get some goat meat, for the name sake and experience sake.I would definitely recommend if you are able to go.Note: It is somewhat expensive."
"What a bummer. I wish the pig face (which was wonderful) made up for the terrible experience we had! I know I am a pooper in a sea of happiness for this place, but I had to write about it. And I VERY rarely feel strongly enough to write anything on yelp. Â But this had to be said. We went here on a Friday night KNOWING and PLANNING for a 2 hour wait. We tried for reservations a few times in the past. No dice. We went a few weeks ago and tried on a whim to go on a Friday--I know--silly! But why not? You never know..... No dice---it was a 2 hr wait. So tonight. TONIGHT. We came knowing we would have 2 hour wait, and were TOTALLY cool with it. We said ""screw it, it's Friday at 6pm! How bad can it be?"" When the weirdly pretentious hostess told us it would be at least 2 hours, we thought "" no big deal."" (I used to work in a restaurant so I know 2 hours typically means an hour maybe an hour and 45 min, maybe 2 hours tops.) So we hang and we drink and we stand at a rail behind the bar. We let 2 hours go by Â (gladly, we were READY, gosh darn it!) before asking the hostess what is up, and then find out we are ""at the top of the waiting list, and it probably will be another hour at least. But we told you it would be 2 hours at least, so....""No kindness in any of the demeanors of the hosts, no managers noticing the couple who have been there for eons and coming to express concern over our epic wait time. It was a little shocking to me. We have waited 30 min longer than anticipated at other Chicago high end places, and usually someone noticed and offered a drink or appetizer or a sympathetic apology. SOME sort of empathy or customer service. Not here. What to do? We tried to hold out a little longer for a table experience, but I ended up Â finally hovering at the bar, trying not to cry, when finally a nice older couple took pity and made sure we took their seats when they left. A humbling moment but nice that there was kindness in the patrons if not the staff. We ate some nice things, tried to get over the overall douchiness of the whole place, but we could not shake the disappointment. How could we?I am glad I tried the pig face because it was special. And because we will never be back and never recommend eating here."
"Waited two months to get in here and could only manage to get a reservation on a Wednesday at 6:15, I'll take it! They were extremely busy and there was no street parking, but I'll deal with it! We walked in ten minutes late and they were ready and waiting for us and we sat right down by the window with a view of the hectic, busy, and exciting kitchen. The service was kind of slow but I was just so excited to be there and the restaurant was so busy, I didn't mind at all. There was a lot to go over too, a cocktail list, a beer list, a huge list of specials, and the extensive menu. I wanted to order one of everything! The cocktails were all $13, I chose the Ticket Pocket which had Pierre Ferrand 1840 Cognac, Cruzan Blackstrap Rum, and Bienheims Ginger Ale. It was absolutely wonderful. My boyfriend ordered the 4 In The Same which had Grey Goose, Aperol, Lemon, and Green Chartruese. I can't wait to come back and try all of them. Next up, the specials list. The top half had to deal with breads, the middle part with oysters, and the last six items were all goat related. We tried the Goat Empandas with Feta Cheese and they were probably the best part of the meal. As a vegetable we ordered the Sweet Potatoes Au Gratin which were phenomenal with fried string onions and blue cheese on top. The Diver Scallops were amazing as well but the portion was extremely small compared to the rest of the dishes, there were only two (very large) scallops with squash, bok choy, goat XO, and pizza poofs or at least that's what the menu said. The Grilled Pork Ribs were out of this world and a quite sizable portion for sharing and the tomatillo-mushroom slaw really made the dish unique and the grilled scallion vinaigrette was second to none in my opinion. To throw something new into the mix we also ordered the Wood Fired Walter's Chicken with yuzu harissa, fried pickles, kohlrabi, and grilled naan. We had to wait quite awhile for our first course so the manager brought us over some Hiramassa Crudo with crisp pork belly, aji chili, and caperberries. We didn't even complain or ask where our food was, we were both so enamored with the whole place time didn't really seem to matter. For dessert we had some amazing chocolate chili gelato from Black Dog Gelato with Left Hand Milk Stout poured over the top. Delish!I was super impressed with the food and the service. Our server Jessica went above and beyond and wasn't pushy but made great recommendations and checked in with us at the right time. We could see Stephanie working hard in the kitchen and it was just an unreal experience. I'll be back for sure with some more foodie friends and in the meantime, I'll recommend it to everyone who will listen."
"The whole menu is all unique and interesting! And I mean it in a good way. I definitely enjoyed the experience but i think some of the food was more on the salty side for my taste.I would definitely recommend trying this place if you are either visiting or a local. Our server was very nice and answered all our questions. I went with 4 other people and ordered about 12 different dishes. Sounds like a lot for 4 people but it was a good amount of food. This place is like tapas so we each had about a bit or 2 of each of the dishes.The restaurant is a dim-lighted restaurant with a wood oven stove with wooden tables and chairs a very cute setting. Overall the restaurant is a great place to hang out with friends. A very lounge like atmosphere. Now on to the food!...One thing about this place is they don't give you free bread like most places would to start you off. So we decided to order one. We had the Chicken Little (Chicken Liver Butter & Carrot Sage Oil). Sounds great doesn't it? I didn't think it was too spectacular. I had better free bread in my opinion. On to our vegetable dishes...1. Sauteed Green Beans (Fish Sauce Vinaigrette Cashews) this has an asian taste to it (of course because of the fish sauce haha) it wasn't too bad and very flavorful. I liked it something different. Normally I have green beans pretty simple with salt and pepper not too much flavor too it so this was a bit different with the fish sauce vinaigrette. 2. Roasted Asparagus (Rogue River Smokey Blue, Shaved Radish, Crispy Onions). It doesn't take much to make asparagus taste good in my opinion but i think it's because it's one of my favorite vegetables to have. All you have to do is roast them with a little salt and pepper and it's a great side. But this was definitely a nice treat from the regular way I have roasted asparagus. The crispy onions added a great flavor and an extra crisp to the dish. Definitely one of the vegetables on the dish to try. I like this vegetable more than the green beans.Now on to the seafood & meat dishes. The next dish that came out was the Fried East Beach, Egg Salad, Capers. Unfortunately I can not review this dish as I do not eat oysters...but all my friends really liked this dish and said it was delicious so if you like oysters I say try it!4. Crisp Calamari, Rabbit Ravioli, Spring Onion, Red Watercress. Okay, I never thought I would eat rabbit but I figured I had to try everything on the menu because it all just sounded so unique to me. The ravioli isn't that big and there isn't that much meat in it. I really didn't taste the rabbit at all and probably wouldn't have known I was eating rabbit if someone put that in front of me and told me to eat it. And I have to say I like it a lot more than I thought I would. The crisp from the calamari really compliments the rabbit ravioli. I think for those that aren't daring should just try this dish. The flavors and the calamari really just go well together.5. Seared Scallops, Brown Butter XO, Goat Sausage, White Shrimp, Shiitakes, Winter Squash. Ok, I think this is one of my favorite dishes we tried. I love a good seared scallop! Nice and tender. All the flavors mixing together into the bite. I just can't describe it, you just have to try it! 6. Ham Frittes, Smoked Tomato Aioli, Smoked Swiss. I love fries so I had to try it! haha nothing too special about it. It was pretty much crispy fries with bacon bites all over it and then the dipping sauces. A bit on the salty side. So if you ordered too many and had to take a dish out, I would say take this one out. It is one thing that isn't as interesting as the rest.7. Confit Goat Belly, Boubon Butter, Lobster n' Crab, Fennel. Another one of my favorites! This is really buttery so if you don't like butter try to take a piece that's not soaked in butter. Another thing that I never thought I would eat was goat belly but I thought it tasted better than I expected. (which is always nice haha). It has a steak like texture but a bit more tough (compared to the way I like my steak). I liked the crab in this dish more than the lobster (sad, considering I generally like lobster better) but overall all three mixed together with a little of the boubon butter is a nice treat and worth trying.8. Grilled Pork Ribs, Tomatillo-Mushroom Slaw, Grilled Scallion Vinaigrette. This stuff falls right off the bone. Just the way I like it! Another good dish and worth trying. The slaw was ok but I liked that it wasn't overly drenched in sauce.9. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face, Sunny Side Up Egg, Tamarind, Cilantro, Potato Stix. Mix this all together and take a bit! I am running out of space to write my review but this is definitely a YOU HAVE TO TRY THIS IF YOU GO kind of dish.Now for the 2 desserts we had. Ganache Pork Fat Doughnuts, Yuzu Blackberries, Salted Oat Streusel, Malted Vanilla Gelato & Bittersweet Chocolate (Shiitake Gelato Toffee Creme FraicheAll unique but I definitely rec. trying the bittersweet."
"200th review - it was between this or Next, and yes, Girl won! It seems pointless to write a review after almost 2000 reviews Girl already had, but I still have to, it was THAT good! And here is the reason why:1. Although reservation is impossible (I've spent countless nights stalking them on open table and the only time I could ever get was before 5 or after 9), we got our seats at the bar after 15 mins of waiting. And about 15 mins afterward our table was ready (despite the fact they told us that it would be about an hour and a half) - but we stayed at the bar regardless, I liked the bartenders. They serve the whole menu there, and I didn't miss not having a server at all! 2. The staff was extremely friendly, and I loved the atmosphere - trendy but casual. This place is nicer, but not entirely upscale. Some people dressed up, but for a Sunday dinner, and after spending 3 days writing my thesis in my room, I didn't care much. So we dressed casual, and no one seemed to care. 3. The food was phenomenon - every single bite was orgasmic! A bit on the salty side I think, but hey, I love salt, so more for me please. For 2 people, we ordered 8 dishes, and some cocktails. I think 8 was a little too much for 2, we could have gone with 5-6, but the dinning partner has a big appetite, so we ordered more. Here's what we had:- Culture Club: bread with house butter and garlic - basically after this I wanted to order all of the bread on their menu! - Beets salad - I hate beets, and I loved this! Perfect combination of crunchiness and creaminess. - Greenbean: this was a little too salty for me. I think the fish sauce could have been toned down a little - but hey, I grew up on fish sauce so I'm highly critical of anything that contains it. The bean was perfectly cooked, and let's be honest, I still inhaled the whole bowl (dinning partner was pickier than me and he seemed to dislike their use of our national sauce - fish sauce)- Griledl octopus - the octopus was crunchy and chewy enough with a little taste of smoke (grilled). I approve! Â - Escargot ravioli - this perhaps was my favorite, absolutely delicious! Just don't think about what they look like alive, you're set to go. - Pig's face: I basically ate this whole dish myself. No shame! It was amazing beyond belief.- Beef tounge: this has pickled carrot, something I'm pretty familiar with and thus can be a little critical of, but everything goes together so well. - Goat Belly: the huge chunks of lobster made this dish! I had a big piece of fat right at the first bite, and I was a bit turned off by it, but the other diner seemed to enjoy it throughout!4. Drinks were good as well. I had the Best of Three Cocktail and he had a Blood & Goats. I loved both! I wish it wasnt a Sunday and I didn't have more works to do. 5. Bill was high, but totally worth it! 6. Did I mention the bartenders were super nice?Don't let the wait scare you - I am extremely impatient. If you can't secure a reservation, avoid the dinner crowd, bring one other person, and prepare to spend a little. You're almost guaranteered happiness!"
"Let me give you snapshot that speaks for itself. We made reservations around 2 months in advance. The only time we could get for our group of 8 was 11pm on Friday night. When we arrived at 11pm, the place was PACKED. Not one table was empty. I think that says it all.Love, love, love the ambiance. High ceilings, dark furniture, weird murals. They sat us at a circle table, which I really appreciated so we could all talk and see each other. We ordered a crap ton of stuff and our waitress was great at offering suggestions and even making me a cocktail off the menu based on my preferences. You order family style and the kitchen will decide the best way to bring out the dishes to your table.Some of my favorites:- pinn oaks lamb tartare | english pea tapenade & tuna aioli: amazing.- steamed clams | rock shrimp, tarragon, fermented black beans, chinese cruller: seriously? the best broth in the world. juicy.- roasted beets | green beans, white anchovy, avocado creme fraiche: love me some beets, here was no exceptions- wood oven roasted pig face | sunny side egg, tamarind, cilatnro, potato stix: how can I write a review on this place if it doesn't include pig face? it's the cheek and very, very good. - wood fired walter's chicken | yuzu harissa, fried pickles, shaved brussels with grilled naan: this has got to be the best chicken i have ever eaten at a restaurant in my life. it was tender, juicy, tasty - you name it. the chicken outshone every piece of meat we had.- both desserts we ordered were delicious. ganache pork fat doughnuts and the prairie fruit's farm goat cheese bavarois. i probably preferred the bavarois over the doughnuts.Some suggestions:- If you're going to get the pig face, I would recommend to not get the braised beef tongue. To me, the textures were pretty similar and I didn't really get anything new from the beef tongue after I had tasted the pig face.- Although good, the ham frites are just french fries. Pick something else off the adventurous menu.- Don't order the roasted asparagus. Nothing new here, it was probably my least favorite thing on the table.I cannot stress enough. GO!"
"So I went here last weekend for my birthday...had heard amazing things and had a reservation booked for 2 months, so was really looking forward to this meal. Â We ordered 5 of the sharing type plates. Â The fried pickles, which were decent and probably the only thing I enjoyed, the wood grilled broccoli (it had this odd creamy/cheese sauce on it that did nothing for such a delicious vegetable), the kona kampachi crudo, the apple bread and the lamb ribs. Â Nothing we ordered blew us away which was such a let down. Â Also, the lamb ribs were the last to arrive, we were most excited about this dish, as it looked amazing when it was delivered to the table next to us. Â My boyfriend tried to cut two of the ribs off, but there was a giant bone at the top of the lamb that stretched the entire width of the rack. Â Because of this, we were unable to divide up the ribs so we could share. Â Was this supposed to be cut off for us in the kitchen? Â We asked the waitress if we could get a sharper knife which I'm guessing set off the ""unhappy patron"" alert to the manager, as he came over and asked if everything was okay. Â Sure, everything was okay but we just needed a sharper knife. Â His response to us: ""I'm sorry, the sharpest knife we have is a butter knife."" Â A butter knife at a restaurant that serves that many different kinds of meat?! Â That makes no sense. Â Anyway, he asked if the kitchen could cut them for us so I agreed to that because how else would we eat them. Â He returned them to our table with the just the top bone removed (they weren't really cut for us). We tried them and they were 100% pure fat. Â I had 2 ribs with no real edible meat on them. Â Biggest let down of the night. Â I will not be going back here, as it is far too overpriced (for what you get) and nowhere near the 5 stars people give it. Â Sorry, I wish I had something better to report, as I was really excited about this place."
"Get ready to get yelled at and be given a goaty attitude by this presumptuous chitown restaurant's bartenders! 2 of them in particular! and you won't miss them, as they are literally the big fish in that resto's small murky pond, also known as their filthy bar because of their filthy attitude. They choose to be rude and arrogant, and are pros in this regard. It's not okay to ask questions and you gotta to know your alcohol very well and won't have the time and luxury to explore. They want you ready, decided, and certain upon sitting. They probably just make trips between that miniature bar and their miniature studio apartment that they are completely ignorant about the world and what it takes to make guests have a complete dining experience. It's just a job to them, and does not know anything about going above and beyond, not even the simple rules of courtesy and civility. Get a girlfriend and a life so you won't be so angry for no reason!"
"Seriously, where to start!?! When one waits and waits in anticipation for a restaurant to open, the expectations are almost unfairly high. This is one of those rare times, however, where the expectations were not only met, but they were unbelievably, unquestionably exceeded. Honestly, I would normally hesitate to go so over the top in a review for fear of setting another's expectations too high, but after last night that is just not possible. Everything, and I truly mean everything, was beyond top notch. The service from literally the first step in the door, to the decor, to our server (Amy, you were amazing!) and all of the other servers (a true team effort), to the food...OMG, the food. I'm almost at a loss for words to describe the food. The words subtle, complex and creative are so often overused, and in the world of food, have become so trite. At the G&tG, however, they almost don't do the food justice. I know, you're asking yourself how it can be THAT good. Honestly, it just is. The flavors are so layered and so subtle and then BOOM (or sometimes it's a little boom), another flavor hits your palette. The mix of ingredients is so spot on, I literally marvel at how perfectly they were compiled.[Pause] In writing this review, I'm transported back to last night and I keep remembering 'this' and then 'that' and then 'this'...it was so good that I'm literally having trouble not taking off on a million tangents all at once. I'll try! Ok. The menu is broken down into three parts: Veg, Seafood and Meat. There are 10 'small plates' on each list, so this is definitely a place I could go with my vegetarian friends. On the other hand, they offer dishes as varied as crispy pig face and escargot to pan roasted chicken and NY strip, so really, I think anyone can eat here and eat here well. Every dish (yes, every single one that we tried) has such an interesting mix of ingredients and is so meticulously thought out that nothing is ""just average"" or ""just ok"". What we ate: (yes, I'm one of those dorks that kept the menu, so no, this is not from memory...lol)1. Roasted beets, green beans, white anchovy and avocado creme fraiche2. Grilled baby octopus, guanciale, lemon-pistachio vinaigrette3. Crisp skate, grilled calamari, chickpeas, grilled radicchio and tomato aioli4. Smoked goat pizza, tart cherry soffrito, black kale and ricotta5. Crisp soft shell crab, sweet corn, lime and chili aioli6. Wood fired escargot, romesco, bagna cauda and romanesco7. Grilled lamb ribs, sweet onion bbq, grilled avocado, pistachio picadaFrom what we were told, the menu is going to change all of the time, so I'm not going to go into each dish in explicit detail. Suffice it to say that everything was truly superb. Another really nice thing is that this is the kind of place you could come to for a celebratory dinner and linger with a large (or small) group for hours; you could come with a friend or on a date for a few small plates and a glass of wine and call it a night; my husband even mentioned that he'd love to stop in for a beer at the bar and a plate of something like the escargot. It really is that flexible. Have I gushed enough? I think perhaps I should cut it here. :)Thank you, Ms. Izard, for staying in Chicago. We loved Scylla when it was around, we cheered for you through the entire season of Top Chef and we're thrilled that you've now given Chicago the Girl & the Goat. Long live the Goat!"
"Ah-maz-ing. Had such a great dinner last night at Girl & the Goat, left totally stuffed and totally satisfied. Everything we tried was amazing but the real standouts were the beet it bread, the diver scallops, and the beef tongue.Our server totally knew what was up, and everyone there was awesome at their jobs, plates were always cleared, glasses always full, and the runners actually knew what was in the food they were serving you! The only negatives were the cocktails. We tried 3 different ones and they all just tasty like tangy fizzy nastiness. I would not recommend the cocktails at all. Also, we were seated at a small table near the bar. There was a partition with a little ledge for people to rest their drinks on. It was really annoying having groups talking directly in our ears and leaning over our table to see what we were eating. You'll get your chance. I definitely recommend you check this place out, just get there early and if you have to wait for a table don't stick your face in the meals of people who are already seated. Noobs."
"Superb! Great atmosphere and fantastic service from Patrick. Came with 3 girlfriends and we all shared the pig face (A+ for how it melted in my mouth & for Â the flavors of egg and sauces), the crispy duck tongue (A for texture and unique salty flavor); pork belly sushi, escargot raviloli, (both B++ amazing but not my favorite dishes there). The chocolate thai chili gelato was a sensory explosion of texture- do not skip dessert!! It was a perfect blend of creaminess for the ice cream, peanut butter fluff with a fantastic crunch of the pomegranate seeds and pine nuts.Perfectly small to medium sized portions- great alone or for sharing if you get lots of plates- which is the best way to go. One of the best meals I've ever had in Chicago."
"Simply amazing.Rustic, hearty, unique. Â Well balanced cocktails, excellent, welcoming service; this place is amazing. Â We had 9 dishes and I really don't think you can go wrong with anything. Â Our favorites were:- Crisp Skate- Pork Liver Mousseline- Braised Beef TongueBest meal I've had in Chicago all year. Â Dishes here are unique, you can't get anything like this anywhere else. Â Will definitely be back."
"Just when you think you have been there, done that... enter Girl and the Goat. Visually aesthetic. Socially chill. Wine and dine.At first, when I came here, my group went heavy on the right 2 columns of the menu -- the seafood and meats. But by the suggestion of the waiter, we added on some veggies on the left side, namely the Roasted Cauliflower and the Sauteed green beans... my mind was blown. it was A-MAZING. who would have known that the highlight of my meal was almost overlooked?I must say, hands down. If I was on a death sentence, and I had to choose my last meal... it would be Girl and the Goat. Stuff your face with some pig face. fog up those windows with steamed mussels. speak in a french tongue with some escargot ravioli. YOU JUST CAN'T GO WRONG!I will for sure bring Jon's mom here next time she is in town. Looking forward to seeing what the Top Chef winner has in store for the menu next!Oh, get their Girl and the Goat labeled wine ;)"
"SO GOOD!A little too loud for my taste (I enjoy being able to talk, not yell), but honestly the only quibble. When they found out someone at the table--ok, me--had a food allergy, they brought a special menu. Then, every single time someone brought us food, they made sure to mention if I could partake. They recommend that you order and share, and although I'm sometimes reluctant, we all walked away stuffed and thrilled. I won't go dish by dish because it changes often, but try new things (we loved EVERY dish--not a single miss), and enjoy!"
"Sharing food with friends, decadence, pig face. You can't go wrong here. Try going at off-prime times. Last minute 9 p.m. tables for two always seem to pop up."
"Continued from my review on 6/26...Now after three plates, I was feeling ok. They weren't huge and I still had room for the dish I had been anticipating the most. The menu changes nightly but on tonight's goat section was the Goat's neck for $32. Pound for pound maybe the best dish I have ever had as far as price goes. A bargain- This dish could be listed as $80 for two, and probably should be.The almighty Goat's neck. Although I didn't know how almighty it would be until it reached my table in all its glory. I've seen goat's neck at other places before. It's usually akin to say an osso buco, which I was expecting. But oh my God. What came out of the kitchen had to be what was a whole goats neck, about 40 ounces total in a huge round glass oven dish, with the bone and vertebrae hidden undermeath the ginormous veil of goat meat. When the server placed it down he said ""Here you are sir, the inconquerable goat's neck!"". For the first 30 seconds I sat there in complete amazement.. shock..dismay.. and utter extreme happiness. In all my eating adventures, I had never come across something so unique and beautiful in my life. Anybody who knows me knows I love meat. All kinds, all sorts, all forms. But nothing makes me happier than a HUGE piece of fatty juicy flesh on the bone. Â As I dug in like a caveman and took my first bite I just smiled and knew there was no way I was going to be able stop eating this, even as I started getting some serious meat sweats. My brain was telling me no, stop, can't eat anymore. My stomach was saying entirely different things. I was in the zone.This dish alone gave Girl and the Goat 4 stars and almost garnered 5. If I went back and this was on the menu, I would skip everything else and just order this so I could fully enjoy it in all its fatty, juicy, gamy, crispy deliciousness. Seriously, one of the best, most unique all around dishes I've had to date. More places should start serving up goat. If you want a barbaric, sinful, extremely satisfying meat experience call Girl and the Goat now, ask if they have the goat's neck and devour it one glorious forkful at a time."
"I liked everything. My favorite was pig cheeks, who knew."
"I was looking forward to dining here after the wonderful things I've heard about this place. Â The ambiance was rustic and minimalistic, with an open floor plan. Â The service was wonderful and our waiter was friendly. Â Because of the popularity of this restaurant, we showed up at 4pm to put our names on the waiting list. Â At 4:15 we were promptly seated at a corner table near the window. Â From there, we ordered our drinks and list of entrees. Â The 2 wines we ordered, the garnacha and petit verdot were pretty standard and served in stemless glasses.The goat cheese butter and bread was our first plate. Â The butter spread was delectable, but in the end, it's just butter. Â By far, my favorite was the goat liver mousse. Â It had such an extraordinary flavor. Â The jam and pickles paired nicely as well, and the crumpets were warm and buttery. Â The diver scallops in the tapenade were just okay, as were the goat empanadas. Â Nothing memorable there. Â The shank was so tender, with the meat falling off the bone. Â The garnish was thinly sliced peaches which paired well. You didn't need to use much of the sauce because the meat was so flavorful. Â We wanted to order an oyster dish, but none of the oysters were sourced from P.E.I or anywhere in Canada, so we settled for the fried oysters which were served on 4 dainty spoons. It was a savory bite, I liked the texture from the breading. Â The roasted cauliflower was the requisite veggie dish. Â I'm not a huge fan of cauliflower, but I liked how they added mint for an extra boost of flavor. Â We were a party of 3, so by the time we ate through 7 plates, our waiter wanted to know if we still wanted the 8th one, the goat belly. Â We all agreed to forgo it and got dessert instead. Â It was a butterscotch type of dessert. Â I liked the flavors, but I'm not a big fan of butterscotch so I didn't relish it the way my friend did. Â All 3 of us were very full by the time dinner was over.Dishes were brought out in a timely manner, not too rushed, and not too long of a wait. Â I liked how they cleared our plates and silverware mid-dinner and brought new ones to replace it, and I appreciated how the water glasses were kept constantly full and they asked if I wanted a refill on my wine. Â It was a casual restaurant with a good variety of food. Â You could come dressed up or dressed down.Overall, I enjoyed my dining experience in this restaurant. Â I feel like it's more of a trendy, see-and-be-seen type of place, but it's very refreshing to see goat dishes on here. Â You don't see that everyday. Â And that goat liver mousse was heavenly. Â It totally made my dinner."
"I had the pleasure of dining at Girl & The Goat for the second time last Friday, and once again I could have asked for a better experience. For the second time, I have sent an email to the restaurant with raving reviews, and thanks for providing what every fine dining experience should be.The cauliflower is unreal, the pig face is a must, and I really enjoy the escargot ravioli.This place is a must, make a reservation early, come early for a mixed drink, and sit back relax and enjoy what is a culinary odyssey.Well done Girl & The Goat, you should be proud."
"3 words: overhyped, overpriced and overly-salty Food was too salty. even desserts were salty. Atmosphere was chill and dim. Waitress nice but came to the table too often. Two stars. I've had better."
"Will try not to just repeat everything others have said....just eat here! Â It's that good, and it will meet or exceed your expectations! Â Plan your night out weeks (months) in advance. Â We got a table for 9:45 6 weeks ago. Â Also, come with some sense of adventure. Â You will eat things here and taste flavors you wouldn't ever expect, or probably crave. Server suggested 2-3 plates/person. Â 4 of us ordered 8 plates+2 breads and dessert and it was plenty. Â 3/person seems like way too much food.A little miffed at the $4 bread, but I love carbs and couldn't resist the varieties of spreads. Â The bread served w/ earl grey tea-infused butter was a table favorite.V's: Â kohlrabi and squash salad (fine), sweet potato gratin (delish)F's: Â mackerel (hated because I don't like, basically, pickled fish), grilled baby octopus (smoky, very flavorful) and scallops (not a scallop fan, but OK)M's: Â goat belly w/ lobster (wow!), pork ribs (outstanding), goat empanadas (one of my faves)Dessert: Â was outstanding! Â blood orange sorbet with parsnip pot de creme (pot de creme was one of the best things I ate. Â Very good!)Bummer that Stephanie wasn't cooking that night, but the top-notch service was exactly what you'd expect."
"Our dinner reservation was for a Friday night at 8pm. How did we score such a prime time? Patience. The reservation was made over 4 months ago. With accolades all around from Best New Chef by Food and Wine to Best New Restaurant via Chicago magazine it was impossible to go into this dining experience without high expectations. So amongst all the 5 star ratings, why the 3 from me? I think namely because I'm pescatarian, and whereas, the Goat is the star of this show, my focus was on the supporting cast which quite honestly, did not blow me away. The atmosphere is very cool, crowded, and buzzing - the""it"" spot. Our table was not quite ready yet so we were directed to the bar area to start with drinks. Dark and Stormy was not dark enough but the beer selection was impressive. We were at the bar for less than 15 minutes but had two separate conversations with a friendly bar crowd. Everyone was chatty and welcoming. Really nice atmosphere. Once seated, our server was very helpful, going so far as to cross out items on the menu that did not jive with my pescartarian restrictions and shrimp allergy. We had: Â  -Dock on the Bay bread with lobster oil and a remoulade dipping sauce:  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â a MUST, absolutely amazing, I could eat a pint of the remoulade Â  -Fried Oyster with egg salad and capers: pretty good Â  -Green beans with fish sauce: was not happy with this, extremely salty.  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â Surprised, since many seem to rave about this plate Â  -Squash ravioli: tasty Â  -Sweet potato gratin: was okay, nice texture Â  -Boyfriend had the pig face. ""Um, I need to order this pig face with an egg on Â  Â  Â  Â  Â it - too curious not to. (Later) Tasty but not good enough to order again."" Â  -Grilled baby octopus: really full by the time we got to this plate so we packed it to goThe portions were pretty generous as usually I am able to eat someone out of house and home. For two people, I would say to order 4 plates max after bread and oysters. Overall, I'm A-OK with Girl & the Goat but not quite a fan."
"Amazing. Â A must. Â Try the cauliflower, it's just amazing. Â The buttery taste of pine nuts, combined with just a hint of parmesan cheese added to a wonderfully sauteed sliced cauliflower. It's exceptional, and the dishes get better from there.A hint on getting in. Â It's a busy place, and reservations can be hard to come by, but if you show up within 30 minutes of them opening, seats at the bar are always available. If you only have a couple people, it's a perfect way to get in without having to book weeks in advance."
Amazing atmosphere. Unbelievable food and great service! 5 stars!
"This restaurant can only be described as culinary genius. It lived up to every bit of hype I ever heard, and seeing Stephanie, in person, quality checking each dish was a ""pinch"" myself moment.From the amaaaaazing bread and beer cheese dip, to the ridiculously amazing beef tongue (a last minute order addition which I would have ordered 6 orders of, if only I wasn't dying of full-ness) and the CRAZY green beans (seriously- I doubted the reviews, thinking ""green beans? Really?"" well- REALLY-- GET THEM)-- it was a FOODGASM experience. And don't miss the desserts-- whoa the flavor combos are to die for. The pig face wasn't as amazing as I expected but the presentation was superb. I enjoyed every single second of this dining experience-- BOOK IT NOW!!"
"I have been to GG twice now and had a great meal both times. Â I went when they first opened and again last night. Â This time around the menu was almost completely different.The atmosphere is casual yet nice and the soundtrack is great!We tried grilled oysters, goat belly, pig face and the tempura soft shell crab. Â Every one was delicious."
Food was very good. Only thing I didn't like was the small dishes. Wish i got more food but I guess that's the point of ordering many dishes to try different items.The people at the bar need to learn more about the drink menu. I asked the serve by the bar for a fruity drink while waiting for the rest of my party to arrive and he didnt what to recommend. Â I'd come back again still
"Getting reservations is insane here, but I sat at the bar with a buddy and found a seat there in just a few minutes. Maybe I was lucky. The previous time we had reservations for a table which was a great experience and we got to meet the famous chef. The food is amazing. Pig face (don't let the name throw you off) is definitely my favorite. Great oyster shooters, too. Duck fat french fries (or similar) is also an excellent choice. Their classic cocktails are also wonderful."
"Service = amazing Drinks = amazing Food = incredible Getting to thank Chef Stephanie in person for my birthday = PRICELESS! My friend and I made these reservations MONTHS in advance and ended up having to make one for 4:00 pm, which we were a little worried about just because it was so early. We arrived right on time and sat at the bar for a little while to try and work up an appetite. About 20 minutes later, we were seated and a very friendly waitress came over to assist us. We weren't really sure exactly what we wanted, and she advised us to order a little bit of everything and just share it all. She pointed us in the right direction with various dishes including some bacon doused fries, a few different meat plates, some incredibly fresh bread, calamari and delicious fried chickpeas. She also timed all the dishes at the perfect time, so everything came out in a complimentary order, we never waited too long for a dish and it ended up taking as much time we'd hoped.... Which was at least 1 and 1/2 hours. Afterwards, we mentioned it was my birthday and wanted to see if we could thank the chef because A. We loved the dishes and B. We try to meet as many Top Chef Contestants as possible. We were able to walk right back there, take a few photos and chat for a few minutes, which I really appreciated. Now, obviously the bill came afterwards and was pricey, as expected but in my opinion it was completely worth it!"
"Making reservations is a must, and the restaurant usually seats you within 10-15 minutes of your time. Â The seating is tight, you are very close to other dates or groups but the restaurant is so loud with conversation and music that awkwardness is eliminated. Â I find that I love going here in the fall/winter over the spring/summer because of the different fresh ingredients that are in season. Â Every item that I've had is delicious, pig face and the goat empanadas are the two things that I always order. Â It is definitely also the place to be daring and try things you haven't before (i.e. duck tongue!) because the way her item menus are served makes everything scrumptious.When friends and family visit Chicago this is the place I take them for a truly delicious one of a kind meal."
"The big paper menu changes approximately weekly, so it's very possible something that was a 'miss' will drop off, to be replaced by something actually delectable.Goat (liver) mousseline (sp?) was too runny once it got to room temp. Maybe I ate it too slow because it is supposed to be whipped. Â But the flavor / appeal just wasn't there for me. Â The crumpets were like flattened southern biscuits and too cake-like. Â But the pickles included with the dish were light and crunchy.Braised short ribs were disappointing, more edamame than beef. Â (Yelp apparently does not have the word ""edamame"" on spell check!) Â The beef was cut Korean bulgogi-style, which terrorized my dinner companions due to the 'large bone' and thin-cut meat.The green beans dish was divine, we gobbled that up, and I wish I could have figured out the acid they used -- lemon juice? Â The pasta in the ravioli was a perfect texture for me. Â The service was quick, unobtrusive, and professional. Â The waiter, in partial beard and tee-shirt, admitted he was a wine snob to a bunch of us non-educated, but introduced us to a really lovely Pinot Gris from Paul Blanck, that I must go find ... now!But a huge reason for the low two stars rating is the noise. Â Just as noisy as Publican, and just as annoying. Â During a weekday dinner, I could only hear my dining companion immediately next to me. Â The friends across the table I could barely hear! Â The aged-wood decor strongly appealed to me, but the noise level was ridiculous for these prices. Â Put a few girl and/or goat themed tapestries on the ceiling and walls, would you?However, I WOULD go again for the unique and changing menu, service and wine. Â But I'll try to go much earlier or much later in the day, instead of the high-point of dinner rush."
"Instead of making a reservation 3 - 4 months in advance, I recommend coming early and eating at the bar if you have a small party. Â It is first come first serve. Â This is the second successful attempt and I did not wait more than 15 minutes each time, even when arriving at 8:00pm on a Saturday (which I don't recommend doing). Â If it is too busy and chaotic, walk down Randolph street which is full of some of the best restaurants in Chicago as a back up plan.There is certainly not a lack of flavor going on at Girl & the Goat. Â Each dish is full of bold, rich, and savory flavors to challenge your palette. Â Stephanie Izard takes simple ingredients like beans, beats, and cauliflower and turns them into something special and complex. Â Every dish seems to burst with flavor! Â Despite its name and unusual contents, the wood oven roasted pig face is a definite must. Girl & the Goat is a great place to order 3 - 5 tapas style dishes with a date or group of people."
"Finally made it this place after months of having a reservation and it lived up to the hype. Â The setting was cool, somewhat dark but not a problem, and a surprisingly big space. Â Really like what they did with the old warehouse space. Â The food was all good and varied. Â Its a sharing menu so you pick a couple of items per person. Â Goat dominated the specials when we were there. Â Our favorite items were the Pig Face, and the string beans. Â How often do you hear someone talking about string beans, but these were that good. Â In fact we purposely save some to take home to enjoy later. Â The table next to us commented how good they were as well and were taking some home also. Â  Desert we went with a line up of cheeses both goat and cows milk. Â The beer list is full of a variety of Â of different interesting options. Â My wife, a wine lover, switched to beer for our meal after checking it out and finding a couple of interesting Belgium or Belgium clone choices. Â If you are looking for a prime time reservation,book early!"
"This is my third time here, it is always great whenever I go. Probably my favorite place in the city. I had two cocktails, four dishes, bread, and two desserts. All were fantastic.The two cocktails were the Blood and Goats and the detox drink. Both were strong, both were very tasty. We started with the rye bread, the lox spread is the same as the one you would get at the bakery across the street. Very tasty, love the spread. Â Roasted Cauliflower had great Parmesan taste with great peppers. Escargot ravioli had a sauce to die for. Probably my favorite dish of the night.Goat carpaccio was light, not gamey, not chewy, great start. Â Small portion, but just enough.Lamb ribs were oily/fatty (in a good way), just enough to make the dish super rich. The ribs were caramelized really well. Peach Buckle dessert was great, I thought it was better without the ice cream than with.Miso-Butterscotch budino was great. Great creamy and crunchy textures. Favorite dessert.The service was fantastic (as always)."
"I can't really say much more that hasn't been said already. Â I'm a picky eater. Â Super picky. Â That doesn't stop me from coming here though. Â It's all delicious. Â I love it here. Â I love it so much that I come back time after time. Â I love that the menu is seasonal, I love that it has some of the same things on the menu as last time. Â I love the bread. Â I LOVE IT ALL!I was fortunate enough to have Stephanie stop by our table one visit here. Â After meeting her, I'm even more inclined to support her business."
"I came here on my first trip to Chicago (mostly to eat at Next) and decided to try this solo one night. Since I didn't have a reservation (and was a solo diner) I sat at the bar to eat. Food: Pig Face, that's all I really need to say about the food. Well not really, there are a lot of of great things. Being solo is a disadvantage here because most of the plates are meant for sharing. The waitress recommended 2-3 dishes per person, so i decided to try 3 or 4 and skip dessert. The pig face was amazing and I wish I had some right now. I remember the duck tongues being really good, as well as the goat carpaccio (my first raw goat). As I said before, it was my intent to skip dessert, however when i say the chocolate sorbet with gooseberries and foie gras marshmallow I knew I had to try it. It might have been the best thing of the night. Drinks: I decided to try beers that night so I cannot comment on the wines or cocktails, but there are a great selection of local and lesser known beers. I had a few and they were all very good and very different. Atmosphere: Busy and vibrant, lots of energy but not too loud. The open line is nice to look into, especially when dining alone.Final Thought: A must when in Chicago, I'm trying to go when I'm there next week."
Mmm try goat empanadas....it just melts in your mouth with all that flavorful and crunchy goodness
"We decided to check out this restaurant last minute on a Sunday night. I saw other Yelpers reviews about three and four month waits for reservations to this place. I gave them a call to see if it was even remotely possible to get a table so last minute. They said to just come on down. We were very lucky to just show up at 8pm on a Sunday night and immediately got seated at the communal table. Having just dined at Alinea the night before (which was amazing), this place was equally impressive. The sweet onion sauce that comes with the Culture Club Bread totally tasted like it was loaded with truffle (though the waitress said there wasn't any in it?). Â And like many other reviewers have noted, the wood oven roasted pig face is amazing.I am so glad I managed to try this place out!"
This place is great!! Ambiance- terrific! Very very busy hereService- great very knowledgeable Food- awesommmee. Peanut butter and honeycomb bacon bread- deliciousGrilled oysters with horseradish- not the favorite but goodCrudo with crisp pork belly- amaazzinggg. Pork and goat noodle dish- great flavor without being heavyGoat loin- delcioussssRoasted chicken with aioli and shaved Brussel sprouts- one of my favorite dishes! Overall amazing and it was fairly easy to share all the plates among us 4 diners with little fighting over who got last bite. Only reason why it's 4 is because dishes were quite small. The server wasn't kidding when he suggested we get about 7-9 dishes for 4 people. Â Drinks are good too- jardin tastes like a fancy margarita. Will be back whenever we can get reservations again!! Â we waited 3 months for a decent time to eat dinner!
"Hands down one of the most interesting and best meals I have ever had. I have eaten in some very ""gourmet"" places (Courtright's, Tallgrass, etc.) and the experience I had at Girl & The Goat was so much better. The atmosphere was great, the food was unbelievable, the staff was top notch. The escargot ravioli and oysters deviled egg style were some of the best things I have ever eaten (go figure) but everything was delicious. I really wanted to try the pork face but opted for the specialty milk braised goat shank and were blown away. It was so odd having this caliber of food in such a laid back, kiddies welcome, rock/rap music playing place but I enjoyed it immensely. Definitely worth the three month reservation wait. Will be back ASAP"
"Food: Sublime. It was absolutely incredible. Shared about 12 small plates among the 4 of us. I was a little stressed about ordering the food, because you have to order everything up front and they choose what order to bring out to you, so you can't order a few small plates and then add on more. If you're getting full, you can't stop the other dishes on order, or if you're still hungry, you can't order more. Fortunately, we had the perfect amount.Favorites: Squash Blossoms, ScallopsLeast Favorites: Quinoa Ravioli (didn't like texture), Green Beans (too salty for me)Ambience: Was a bit loud - a little more casual than I expected, but I didn't mind that. For a Tuesday night was still incredibly busy. We tried our luck by walking in without a reservation. At first we were told a 2.5 hour wait, so we put our names on the list, grabbed a cocktail next store, and came back about an hour later to check in. They were able to seat us then, but with the condition that we had to leave the table by a certain time for an upcoming reservation - we agreed, but because of our limit we were unable to order dessert. Our own loss for agreeing to the table, but at least we got in for dinner.I felt like the host staff was a bit pretentious, likely because they know that they work for an incredibly successful restaurant, and that because people were begging for tables, they could pretty much act however they wanted. They weren't rude by any means, but when we came in as a walk in, it was almost like an ""Are you Serious?"" response. Maybe it was crazy for us to try, but hey, we got in :)Ultimately, it was an incredible dining experience as far as the food is concerned, and I definitely recommend making it out here once to try it!"
"I went with a group of friends and we were able to try so many great dishes, and they were all wonderful. We had the goat empanadas, goat loin, grill seared tuna, scallops, escargot ravioli, and pig face, just to name a few. Â We tried 4 different desserts as well. Â The service was very good and the atmosphere was fun, though a bit loud as we were next to the kitchen area with a lot of activity going on. Â The price was extremely reasonable considering the variety of food we had. Â I definitely will go back!"
"Visiting from LA, so I walked in and and sat at the bar. Full menu and no wait. My date and I ordered 5 dishes. They were all much larger than expected--way too much for two people. One order of cauliflower can definitely feed four people. All of the courses, especially the meat, were way too salty. Octopus, steak, pappardelle, and cauliflower were just okay. Best part of the meal hands down was the Bloody Mary bread (absolutely delicious), our wine, and the fantastic service. Sad, but I don't think G&G is worth the hype."
"Bread Bread Bread. The have been back twice and I still love the bread. Â It changes but Â it is so fresh and hot when you get it. Â My next favorite was the chickpeas fritters Â and hiramasa crudo. crisp pork belly. aji aioli. caperberries. Â I know they are known for the pig face but it something you have to try if it is your first time. Â The short rib has a lot of favors Â so save some bread for it because it was just to much for me alone. I like that I can bring my veggie friend since that have a good veggie selection and a great meat selection too. As for desert, the dragon milk was different and I like the beer combination. Â I suggest you make reservation in advance, the open seating area can Â get crazy and people will stand next to you until you leave to get your spot."
"My Granny Lou used to say that a good meal was made of love. You know. That special dash of this and that. A little kick of ""what, what"" that's made espcially with you in mind.That's how my meal at Girl & The Goat felt. Thoughtful, innovative. Made especially with me in mind. I don't think I've ever been so happy in my life that I was no longer a vegan and could partake in all the meaty goodness that Stephanie has to offer. This is ""small plates"" with a twist and meant to be shared. On my first visit my crew and I started with the wood-fired wiley point oysters, then moved onto the sepia, the escargo ravioli, the sugo and the grilled pork ribs. Oh, Lord. And the sauteed green beans with the fish sauce vinaigrette: Best I've ever had!Every dish just sort of built into a crescendo of exemplary deliciosity (yep, made that up...) The mix of flavors combined with the freshness of the food and the presentation was unparalleled. We and every table around us were just grinning at each other and grunting. And barely stopping ourselves from licking our plates!Believe it or not we saved room for dessert and finished with the sorbet and the chocolate bouchon. We left full, happy and with a few bucks in our pocket -- for the caliber, it was surprisingly affordable. Between the three of us, with drinks included, it came out to about $48 each before tip. We also loved our server, Brennan, who gave can't-miss recommendations all night.So here's how much I loved G&G: I went back solo two nights later and ate in the lounge, where you don't need a reservation. More green beans, wiley point oysters, and got to try the pork shank, courtesy of patrons sitting next to me on a very bad date who didn't touch it. Score!The food is the star, but don't skimp on the drinks: The ""Best of 3"" is best in show!Stephanie has created a real winner in the West Randolph corridor. In every dish, you can taste how much she loves what she does, and that she knows she's good at it. The fact that I thought of my dear, departed Granny Lou and her mantra that a meal should be made with love let me know that my effusive praise for G&G was not off-base. Stephanie brought the love and that kick of 'what what"" that makes a good meal great, and a great meal an ""experience."""
"Went here for the first time last week. We were pleasantly surprised that they could seat us early. Our server was great- very attentive and friendly. She suggested 2-3 plates per person and although everything was delicious, it's also all pretty rich and filling, so I'd say 2 pp (4 dishes for a couple) is plenty.kabocha squash ravioli- 5seafood fideos- 3lamb sausage stuffed calamari- 4green beans with cashews- 5!!pork shank- 3.5 (maybe 4?.. was too stuffed to try more than a bite)After reading the reviews, I want to try: goat masala pizza, chickpea fritters, seppia, scallops, and the blood orange sorbetAlready looking forward to our next visit :)"
"Not going to say a bad thing about Stephanie's G&tG. We had a really nice time there last night. The only thing I will say is it's a tad over hyped. Nothing wrong with the food there at all, but a 3-6 month wait on a table for a nice small plates place is too much. Out of 7 small plates we got last night, only the grilled cauliflower and goat cheese cheesecake stood out. This morning I can barely remember what we ordered to review. The prices aren't bad (see Premise for that) and the staff and atmosphere are lovely, but be prepared that its just a good hangout, not the 2nd coming of food in Chicago. On second thought, I will say, decent cocktails, but utterly forgettable. Served up would serve them better than a $14 cocktail swimming in ice."
"This is my first real meal in Chicago, and I was mighty impressed. Â I've always been a huge fan of Top Chef, and I'm happy I visited a ""Top Chef"" 's restaurant.Bread: Stecca with anchovy butter and garlic oilThe bread was very tasty, and I absolutely loved the anchovy butter; the garlic oil was slightly too bitter for me.Moving on to the more interesting dishes ;)Green beans:This was actually my least favourite dish of the night. Â All the beans were cooked differently: some were burnt, some were rather raw, and some were cooked perfectly. Â I don't know if this was done intentionally to create textural complexity, but I didn't want to play Russian roulette with the beans. Â The sauce was rather salty, the beans on top were nice, the bottom ones were noticeably more salty because they'd been soaking in the sauce longer.Goat, pork and veal sugo:This was a very tasty dish, and highly recommended. Â The flavour and texture of each individual ingredient really came together for me, and I developed more infinity towards this dish as I was eating it, I just wanted to keep on eating. Â The pappardelle was nicely cooked and very flavourful, and I particularly enjoyed the contrast between the veal, pork and lamb. Â The goose berries also added a very refreshing taste, a burst of acidity when I wanted a break.Braised beef tongue:Tongue is probably my favourite part of meat from a cow, and I really enjoyed its raw flavours presented in this dish. Â The masa was nice and crispy, and the sauces were spot-on. Â This is a great dish to order if you like the tongue.Wood oven roasted pig face:This was by far my favourite dish of the night. Â The meat was crispy, tender, juicy, fatty, and everything you want it to be. Â It's like eating bacon an pulled-pork at the same time. Â The tamarind provided it with a nice balance of sweetness and sourness; the potato sticks gave it a great texture; and the egg on top was just heavenly and augmented the dish to a completely different level.Bittersweet chocolate:Very very sweet brownie/cakeThe service was fantastic: our water glasses were never empty, and plates and silverware were replaced between each dish. Â Further, I was under the impression that our waiter was very excited about the food, and he was always happy to offer suggestions and explanations.I am definitely a fan!"
"It is requisite that you learn this term before dining at Girl & the Goat so you can aptly describe the experience: l'orgasme dans ma bouche (""orgasm in my mouth"" made classy by translation). Â And I'm not talking about some fake, Harry Met Sally O-show. Â I'm talking full-on, knees-weakened, eyes-widened, pleasure-points-trembling, sensory thrills.Les orgasme provocateurs (from most thrilling):GOAT CHEESECAKE: I actually applaudedFROG LEGS: our little pile of bones almost haunted us into a second roundCONFIT GOAT BELLY: This has goat belly, lobster, and some magical crab puree...are you kidding me?? This is the one that brought tears GOAT LIVER MOUSSE: slather this on anything, and I will lick it off...anythingGRILLED BABY OCTOPUS: our first dish...A+ foreplay to the goat dishes!We also had the Mole and Avocado bread, which was very tasty in its own right, but I won't order it next time b/c it threatened to fill us up and keep us from enjoying more goat.As a final testament to the quality of the food, we didn't have reservations so ended up standing at the rail for 2+ hours eating our dinner, and I didn't really notice that we were standing....save when my knees buckled from Les orgasmes dans ma bouche!"
"OMG! Â This place was AMAZING! Â We were a walk in and planning on just eating at the bar when a spot opened up....however, we grabbed a drink and then they came over and said they could squeeze us in (SWEET!!!). Â So literally after 20 mins of being there, we were seated. Â They have tables and communal dining so the best of both worlds. Â The decor is right up my alley...a little dark, loft-ish, etc. Â Servers wear these cute tees with funny sayings on the back....hilarious.The kitchen is all open which I really like because you can totally see what the heck they are doing back there. Â Its like ""tapas"" style so there are tons of choices. Â We started with the servers recommendations of the bread, goat cheese, and corn relish. Â So good. Â Then we had some chick pea dish with heirloom tomatoes, cheese, and heaven in a dish. Â Green beans with an amazing sauce and nuts....so freaking good. Â Lamb ribs and the skate. Â Everything was really good, I have two complaints....the server didnt keep up with our drinks and the skate was a little too salty...However, I totally would go back and recommend this place to other people....plus, top chef was there and we of course got a pic with her!!Not to mention, the price point was pretty fair!!"
"Hats off Chef Stephanie Izard!Visited Chicago for the weekend and had a reservation made 4 months in advance. Upon arriving the restaurant, we were greeted by the friendly hostess and directed to the bar area to wait till our table was ready. The busy restaurant and bar had a great vibe, the 30 minute wait wasn't too bad.As most of the 2,000 plus reviewer had shared, food is amazing here. All 5 dishes, wine, and dessert were well beyond impressive - and leave you wanting more.One advise for those of you who're a die hard fan of Chef Izard and who are visiting Chicago - make more than one reservation. You're gonna want to go back after one meal. Thank me later!"
"Oh the food....the food. I don't even know how I managed to only come here once.It's been awhile since my first visit, but the memories can still make my mouth water.All I can say is this. The food was excellent; much like the atmosphere and the service. 5 stars all around.I think I just talked myself into my next trip here."
"So I have a confession to make. Â I'm not a foodie, I'm just a girl that enjoys cooking and eating tasty food (and sometimes not tasty food). Â So I really didn't understand everything that happened here. Â Service was nice, decor was great, and the food was so-so. Â The scallops were cooked perfectly, and the mushroom, shrimp, brown butter xo (wtf is an xo) was...interesting. Â It, like everything else we ordered, was a little heavy on the salt. But could someone tell me why there was Cap'n Crunch in there? The goat pizza was definitely tasty, probably the highlight of the meal. Â The braised pork shank had the potential to wow, but it just fell flat. Â Finally, the chickpea patty was just ok too. Â I wholly agree with everyone who said this place was spendy. Â My experience just wasn't worth the cost. Â Honestly, in a week or two I'll probably forget what I ate here."
"We made a reservation a few months in advance of a trip to Chicago, so we had no problem getting in. I don't eat meat, so I can't vouch for any piggie stuff, but I really loved the shishito peppers. Would never have thought of them as that substantial. Also had the chickpea fritters. I am allergic to eggplant but the chef revamped them sans eggplant and they were great. Had a really fun time. The only glitch on the menu was the salmon we had. Truly, not that great. Everything else was delicious and a fun vibe too. Would love to go back if I'm ever in Chi again."
"Our experience at Girl and the Goat was absolutely perfect. Â So much so in fact that I actually am using Google Docs to write this review so I can get it right. Â I started this the day after our visit on 28 August but did not get it right until today. Â First off, the place is really fantastic. Â Great mood overall and the decor is awesome. Â I cannot remember if their opening was delayed but it was they must have taken the time to focus on the right things. Â The host staff was very, very nice. Â There was no vibe of ""you are lucky to be here"" that we have experienced at other places (see my upcoming review of Craftsteak in Vegas). Â Ok... The food. Â There are so many great sounding things on the menu that sharing is a must. Â My wife and I decided on:Pan Fried Shishito PeppersWood Fired WellfleetsCrisp Soft Shell CrabEscargot & GoatballsCrisp Soft Shell CrabIn a nut shell all items were fantastic. Â However, the Crab was incredible. Â I would suggest having 1 per person to avoid fighting. Â I am not sure how they pulled if off but the coating (I want to say breading but that is not right) was perfect and only enhanced the taste of the crab.Finally... Â Stephanie Izard is actually as cool as you think she would be. Â I am a huge Top Chef fan and have think I have a bit of a crush on Ms. Izard (my wife is aware and is cool with it). Â I had a great view of the open kitchen and was able to watch her calmly act as expediter. Â The coolest thing was when Stephanie stopped by to say hello. Â I am not sure it is was timing or if our server (fantatic too btw) sensed my starstruckedness, but I got a menu with an autograph. Â Perfect night."
"Being a big Top Chef fan and an out-of-towner, I booked this place months before coming up for a friend's wedding. Â The only reservation time I could get was 10:45. Â We came a bit early - 9:45ish, ordered a drink, and were lucky enough to snag a couple seats at the bar soon after arriving. Â Before I get into the food - props to Nate for making good drinks and being attentive with our food orders.My girlfriend and I ordered the bread with the beer cheese sauce, steamed mussels, duck tongue, pig face, goat empanadas and finished with the chocolate thai chili gelato. Â Everything was excellent - the pig face was by far my favorite, and the duck tongue and beer cheese sauce stood out as additional highlights. Â The food all came out at the right time and at a good pace - we were never overwhelmed nor waiting on any dish.A great start to a long weekend in Chicago."
"I'm going to be honest... I was torn between 3 stars and 4 stars... but I'm going to go with that G&theG was a 3.5 star place that leans more towards 4. I had been dying to come to Girl & the Goat for a while now. It was one of the few reasons I wanted to visit Chicago* Â and I made it a point to make it a stop on my trip**. My friend Kevin and I showed up just after opening on a Sunday and the place was already pretty much full of people who were intelligent enough to make reservations weeks in advance***. Luckily there were a few prime seats open at the bar and so we graciously took them.The bartenders were attentive and offered some recommendations for what was on tap. G&theG had a decent draft selection that was moderately priced (surprising for such a hot restaurant). Loved the decor... Very trendy. Definitely a great place to impress a date. Even the bathrooms were classy. I'm a sucker for a classy bathroom.We decided to pick a plate from each section on the menu to really get a taste for everything G&theG had to offer. Here's what we went with and my thoughts...Grilled Baby Octopus w/ guanciale, wax beans, romano beans, radish, & pistachio-lemon vinaigrette:-- Very good, albeit it to was a little salty side. God, I sound so much like my father right now.Steamed Mussels w/ goat sausage croutons, cilantro, caesar:-- This was especially good. Probably helped that they accidentally gave it to us and told us to keep it. #1 thing I have in common with that plate: Our mussels are humongous. Ha, get it?Hen of the Woods Mushroom Ragout w/ sweet potato agnolotti, shroom creme fraiche, & capers:-- Salty as all hell. I don't know if it's just me, but Chicagoans seem to salt the heck out of everything. My friend really enjoyed it, but I was less than pleased. In my opinion it was flat out disappointing.Goat Carpaccio w/ tongue-olive vinaigrette & smoked roe: -- Mmm... sooo good. Brought to mind memories of Peru and all the alpaca carpaccio I consumed. I'm a monster. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face w/ sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, & potato stix:-- Holy moly! This was amazing. I'm not lying there was nothing but silence after a necessary ""OH MY GOD!"" was exclaimed by my friend and I. We left no pig face behind. It was completely devoured. The plate wiped clean. I will dream about that roasted pig face for the rest of my life. If I had died right after consuming that it would have been OK. What else do I need to do now? Nothing, because I ate the dish of a lifetime when I ate that.----*#1 reason: My friend. Friends first, food second. (Although sometimes I even have trouble keeping true to that motto.)**I obnoxiously mentioned a thousand times that I needed to go to G&theG. ***Be smart...make reservations weeks, no wait... MONTHS in advance if you want a chance in hell of getting a table on a weekend in this place!"
"PRETENTIOUS and ANNOYING Reservation Confirmation System!Haven't eaten here yet. Â Supposed to eat here tomorrow. Might change the plan.Got a voicemail from Natalie to confirm my reservation for tomorrow. Â Seemed more like a threat! Â Less than 24 hours to re-confirm (after already Â booking and receiving a confirmation email) OR ELSE!The OR ELSE is that you lose your table! All this wrapped in a tone of the Girl and the Goat is doing YOU a favor to let you eat here!Please!Called the manager to discuss. Decent enough guy but basically said - yeah we have no idea really how to manage the reservation system - there are some problems. I get it - you want to fill your restaurant and keep it full BUT - the overall perspective seemed aggressive and greedy!Based on this experience, who gives a rat's ass about the food."
"I was able to sneak in with a last minute reservation and wow, was it worth it. Â  From the service to the food it was a wonderful experience. Â They have a regular and a gluten free menu (most of the regular items were on the gluten free menu), a daily specials menu, a bread menu plus the cocktails and wine/beer menu. Â If you like to have choices, this is you place. Â For those that have trouble deciding, our server was excellent Â with helping us navigate through the menu. Â I kinda wish they had a tasting or chefs menu option but in the end you can create your own or have your expert server help you create the perfect dining voyage. Â Their main menu has three main sections (Veg, Fish, Meat) with several selections in each. Â The portions are on the medium-small side -- not quite small tapas but definitely not a full entree. Â They are perfect for sharing and with the quantity of items on the menu, sharing is essential.Summary of my experience:Sauteed Green Beans - I was a bit hesitant to try these because it seemed to be recommended by every review that I read but I'm glad I ordered them anyway. Wow, I could eat those all day long. So delicious and I think the fish sauce vinaigrette really is the key ingredient to bring boring greens to life. Â And this is coming from someone who isn't the biggest fan of green beans. Â My mom would be so proud!Hen of the Woods Mushroom Ragout - I liked the textures of this dish but it wasn't my favorite. I thought it was a bit on the salty side. Â I read some reviews that said they thought the food was salty so I was a bit worried about the rest of my meal after I tried this dish. Â Luckily, this was the only one.We decided to skip the fish section and opted to select two items from the special menu:Goat Empanadas - This was my favorite item. Â Two perfectly prepared empanadas filled with tender shredded goat with tomatoes and creamy cheese as a topping. I could have easily had 3 or 4 or more of these. Goat Loin - Had to go with goat for obvious reasons. Â I've had goat leg before but I'd never tried the loin. It was a solid item but I think if I could go back I would try the goat leg or another meat or fish item instead. Â  From the meat section:Grilled Pork Ribs - Yum. Â The meat was so tender and just perfectly complimented with the tomatillo-mushroom slaw. Â I could devour a whole rack of these but I'm glad I didn't because I was able to leave just enough room for dessert.Dessert was probably my favorite part of the meal. Â For this I have to thank you Yelpers. Â I read quite a few reviews that said to make sure to leave room for dessert. Â One review even said that you should order all four! Â Apparently they have four desserts each night and they change them quite a bit. Â Luckily we tried two: The first was bourbon apples, vanilla gelato and a couple of beignets. Â Very refreshing especially when you pair it with the second dessert: Chocolate bouchon, chocolate cake with peanut butter gelato, pomegranate seeds and these little crunchy miniature rice pebbles. Â It had the perfect balance of sweet, salty, crunchy and moistness. Â Perfection. Â One bite of the chocolate bouchon, then one bite of the vanilla with apples and then a swig of red wine -- Heavenly.Both wines that I tried with the meal were excellent and described perfectly by the waitress. Â I wish I had enough room for some of the cocktails but next time. Â They looked really good.Overall, it was an amazing experience and I wanted to try the rest of the items on the menu. Â I would definitely go back. Â I have been quite impressed by all of the Top Chef contestants restaurants. Â Each one I've been to has never disappointed and neither did The Girl and the Goat. Â Stephanie was working this night and it was a real treat to be able to try her restaurant. Â High compliments to the her and her entire team. Â Thank you.Tip 1: You need to make reservations way ahead of time but you can show up and sit at the bar. Â If you do show up at the bar keep in mind that it is already full shortly after they open at 4:30pm. Â Tip 2: Leave room for at least two desserts."
"One of the most fun dining experiences I have had in Chicago. The music is loud enough to hear but quiet enough to be able to talk over it easily. The dining room offers views to the kitchen where you can see Stephanie approving and adjusting dishes before they head out to tables. Even though you will easily pay $65+/person, there is no sense of pretentiousness that you can occasionally get at other similar restaurants.The food was incredible. Starting with the bread every dish seemed to be better than the last. My only minor complaint is that you order all of your dishes ahead of time and the server courses them out for you. I prefer to order as I go at a small plates restaurant. My favorite dish was the hiramasa crudo with pork belly - followed closely by the pig face which I think should be on breakfast menus everywhere."
"Atmosphere is awesome. It's somehow simultaneously trendy and upscale while feeling earthy and down-home. It's paradox I tells ya!The staff is very knowledgeable about the drink and food menus and quite gregarious. I also appreciated the fact that they weren't pushy at all about ordering anything. When I was done with my beer they took my glass and that was that. It's just a minor pet peeve of mine when they try to push more drinks on you.Awesome, awesome food. But I think the average rating speaks for itself there. I'm not sure what else I could add so I'll tell you what we had and you can go from there.Cauliflower - Roasted perfectly and paired with pickled bits of magic and parmesan. The sour notes worked great and gave the dish a real vibrant flavor. The cheese rounded it out and gave those flavors someplace to stay around in your mouth. Little bit too much cheese for our taste.Skate - Really tender and well cooked. Great dish to try skate for the first time. I didn't think the roasted lentils added much overall.Goat carpaccio - Really liked this. The goat made for a subtly different flavor from beef carpaccio, and it was paired with some greens and pickled bits. This was our second choice after we were told they were out of the goat shank, but it was a pleasant surprise.Pig face: This is just a delicious mess. Tasty pig parts, a fried egg with runny yolk, and thin hash browns, how can you go wrong? But this is quite unlike other such dishes in that the pig parts here are fairly unique in terms of texture and flavor. Don't be scared, try it."
Every dish was so salty that we weren't able to finish any of them. Â We were comped our meal but we won't go back for round #2.
"Phenomenal in every way, every time i've been here.This place, she is deliciously delectable. Â The staff (oh, Gary's one of the most darling!) is well versed in the menu & can readily handle food allergies. Â Fortunately, the menu is completely open to me & i suggest trying everything! Â Let your wait-person guide you through the experience of Girl & the Goat - at least the first time.The bread & circuses distinguish this establishment & its cast as a can't miss dining venue.Oh, & mighty effing well stocked with a fine selection of spirits, too, of course."
"""It's been said and done,Every beautiful thought's been already sung, And I guess right now here's another one... ""I, like so many others, have been a fan of Stephanie Izard since she competed for-- and won-- the coveted Top Chef title all the way back in Season 4. I didn't live in Chicago at the time, but I WAS in the city when The Girl & the Goat finally opened, and I made a vow to make it here one day.It took me two years to finally get my act together. And I cannot tell you how much I'm kicking myself for those two years, because now I'm leaving Chicago, and I won't be able to sample more of this girl or her goat... ""No one comparesYou stand alone, to every [other restaurant I've tried]Music to my heart, that's what you are""That's right. I like Selena Gomez. But the lyrics are fitting, too-- The Girl & the Goat is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. And no one else compares.First, the food here is incredible. The menu changes often (or so I'm told), and the current menu's praises have been sung over and over again: the food is delicious, it's perfectly cooked (or close to it), it's fresh, it's eclectic, and it's varied. But I think what really impresses me is that the food is also somewhat... surprising, unexpected. Things that I really would not think go together-- really DO. Standouts on this front, I think, are the Roasted Cauliflower (with pickled peppers, pine nuts, mint, and parmesan cheese); the Skuna Bay Salmon (with lamb sausage, grilled blueberries, pepitas, and chimichurri); and the Goat Confit Belly (with crab and lobster, fennel, and vanilla-bourbon butter). Seriously, Walk, or perhaps Run, but do not pass Go, and try these dishes-- or probably anything else on this menu-- as quickly as you can.The prices here are absolutely reasonable. Each time I came, I gorged myself on way too many dishes and left with a full stomach and a surprisingly un-empty purse.But what really, really puts the icing on this cake is the service. I cannot tell you how lovely, friendly, and accommodating the waitstaff here was. (And frankly, this isn't true of a lot of the ""fancier"" places in Chicago, where I often feel judged or looked down upon for being young.) My sister is mildly allergic to cheese, and so we asked for one of the dishes sans cheese and another just ""as is""-- she just wasn't going to try it. But they actually prepared a smaller dish just for her of both, so that we could have the dishes as the kitchen intended and she didn't have to miss out, either. They also answered all the questions we had about the dishes and were even quick to comp a dish after my mother casually mentioned that the vegetables were a little overcharred. Needless to say, we left a really large tip.Here's the part of the review where I dip back into the ""chorus"" just before fadeout, just in case you didn't get it the other twenty times I (or any other reviewer) said it: this restaurant is awesome, and Stephanie Izard is a rockstar.""I, I love you like a love song, babyAnd I keep hittin' repeat-peat-peat-peat-peat""[Fade Out]"
"I've never been to Chicago before and this may be the last time I ever visit this Arctic January tundra again so I wanted to make the most of my food decisions. In a week that included reservations at restaurants such as Frontera Grill and Alinea, Girl and the Goat was by far my most anticipated meal. I am a huge Top Chef fan and an even greater fan of Stephanie. Nothing would have made me happier than to love this place so it is with sadness that I report that it didn't live up to expectations. We ordered the cauliflower, chickpea fritter, pig face, goat belly, sweet and sour cod cheeks and smoked bread. The first three dishes mentioned had some sort of acidic component that blew out my palate (I am fully aware of how pretentious that sounds and I fully admit my palate is poorly developed and unrefined, but I don't have any other way to describe how my mouth felt afterwards). It was so acidic that I literally felt like my mouth was being punished and winced during some bites. The sweet and sour cod had a great light coating but not much of a sweet and sour flavor. The goat belly was by far my favorite dish of the night and probably the most well balanced dish we had that night but it was also my last dish and by then I was too full to fully enjoy it. The total for the dishes and a drink came out to over $100 after tip. I don't know if this was just an off day for the restaurant or if I ordered the wrong dishes but I felt like my meal itself deserved three stars. However, I fully believe Stephanie is amazing and given how great the goat belly was, I'd probably be back again."
"Food was good, but not worth the hype. Â Service was bad. Â I don't know if they were busier than normal, but it took 20 minutes to meet the waitress and get my drink order in. Â They kept filling my water glass, but I needed a drink since I was there with my wife and mother-in-law. Â :)Maybe I just don't like fighting crowds after living in the city for 11 years, but service is make or break for a place like this."
"Very fun, very innovative menu. Â Can get loud and crowded, but it is all part of the charm"
"Came here with another foodie. Â We ordered quite a few different dishes, but nothing really stood out as o.m...g.... delicious. Â I have tried Little Goat, which I think is much better."
"I have been here twice and LOVE IT! Â Both times we arrived around 5 and were able to be seated right away without reservations. Â I recommend arriving early as it gets really packed. Â Yesterday we were seated at a communal table (with 2 other parties) right in front of the kitchen. Â It was exciting to see the chefs work, and fun to see what everyone else at the table was ordering.Recommendations: basically everything. Â I've had (and LOVED): the sugo, scallops, roasted cauliflower, squash ravioli, and the pork shank. Â Word to the wise: the pork shank is enormous, order the rest of your meal sparingly. Â It was sooo good, though, melting off the bone. Â I'd love to agree with the other reviewers not to order the bread, but I've had it both times and it's excellent. Â The peanut butter bacon spread was amazing. Â I really hate to fill up on bread, but it was totally worth it.The only miss we had was the goat pizza. Â It was surprisingly bland.The service is excellent (although the bussers are very eager to clear away plates before they're completely empty). Â Our waitress explained everything very well and was attentive without being intrusive.I will continue to come back to Girl & The Goat. Â I just voted for Stephanie as Food & Wine's Best New Chef. Â Go Stephanie and Goat crew!"
"100% on this bandwagon. Â One of the best dining experiences I've had in Chicago. Plenty of people have provided highlights for this place, so I'll just add what we ordered and the cost to give yelpers some add'l info to go on. For 2 people:kohlrabi saladroasted beet saladconfit duck bellywood oven roasted pig faceginger bread cake dessert one beertotal - $67 This felt like enough food for us, but we weren't exactly starving when we went there. Everything was delicious, filling without being too heavy. Would love to go here again if I'm ever lucky enough to get another reservation!"
Its overhyped. I went a couple months back. The food is too salty and overpriced. The service was outstanding. It just isnt worth it though. I would never go back. I guess it is one of those tourist hotspots.
So worth it to go back the second time. Having a bigger group was key - we ordered more plates to share and there were several that I absolutely loved. Not too mention the desserts were great too. We'll be back again.
"As a vegetarian you have limited options when dining out - not at Girl & the Goat. It's not because there are many dishes, it's because each dish is so spectacularly made. I ordered the Wonton plate (it contained ratatouille, popcorn and other items). It was literally a concoction of flavors all coming together perfectly. The ambience was great, the staff was very knowledgeable about their menu and extremely polite. It would definitely recommend this place."
"First visit to Chicago in 12 years, traveling on business. Â We did not have dinner reservations but went in ""early"", with hopes of a random no-show or cancellation. Â 5:30PM is not quite early enough though. Â We faced a 2-hour wait for table for 4. Â The next best thing? Â Try the bar's window couches, in the corner. Â It's cozy and intimate. Â Yes, a little loud, but not more so than most bars/lounges.The menus (plural) were a bit overwhelming. Â We had no idea where to start, except that at least one dish had to be goat of course. Â We were fortunate enough to squeeze in next to Chris, a regular and professional foodie -- a market researcher studying food trends and someone who enjoys the Girl & The Goat atmosphere whenever he has a chance. Â He shared a special treat with us -- the barrel-aged (3 mos) cocktail menu. Â It's beguiling and intimidating -- a selection of sometimes dainty cocktails that can easily drop kick the unaware or uninitiated. Â Ladies, be daring and put your man in his place! Â If not, Marsanne, conservatively measured by the glass, is delightful.Our super-knowledgeable waitress recommended we share at least 8 dishes, and, with additional expert menu guidance from Chris, we opted for:- Roasted Cauliflower- Wood Grilled Broccoli- Chickpea Fritters- Mushroom Ragout- Grilled Baby Octopus- Pan Roasted Halibut, with blueberries- Wood Fired Walter's Chicken, with yuzu harissa and fried pickles- Smoked Goat Empanadas- Honey Peanut Butter Bread- Bittersweet Chocolate Cake, with shiitake gelato and toffee creme fraicheEverything was a delight and near perfection! Â Dishes were served in waves, each dish building upon the ones before it. Â After much consideration, my personal favorite was the halibut with blueberries. Â Surprisingly clever; a combination I personally wouldn't have considered. Â I had high hopes for the baby octopus -- perfectly cooked but the pistachio lemon vinaigrette seemed slightly off at bite's end. Â Perhaps I'll feel differently another time. Â The unconventional dessert was a revelation. Â Creme fraiche doesn't usually agree with me either. Â The shiitake gelato may have been the right distraction with this flourless cake.Veggies & vegans, you are loved here. Â Special diet menus came out just as fast and with just as much care as the regular menu. Â Staff really takes care of you. Â Every non-meatie, non-dairy, gluten-free dish was perfection. Â The preparation, seasonings, and presentation framed and highlighted the main ingredient(s) in each dish. Â No culinary afterthoughts or veggie-for-veggie's-sake creations here.Our dining experience just got better and better as the evening wore on. Â Absolutely what I expected from a Top Chef restaurant, and one of my favorite chefs from the show. Â Enjoy!"
"I had heard so much about the Girl & The Goat that when I got to go I had a hard time believing we got a table. The ambiance was nothing different than any regular restaurant yet the food was so disappointing. Some items where super greasy, others where tasteless out of the four people we where none liked it. We where so stunned about the good reviews we had heard about this place that we double checked where we where. This was definitely a bad experience yet a memorable one as it is not everyday that the most talked around spot in town ends up so disappointing."
"Food: Â is generally fresh, well-prepared, tasty, and unique. Â The scallops were among the best I've had, cooked just right with the proper amount of seasoning and garnish. Â The pig face was good, but a little on the heavy side, and the cauliflower was a nice side dish. Â I was very impressed by their fresh bread, opting for the beet bread with vinaigrette and goat cheese butter. Â Dessert was also impressive.Service: Â I sat at the bar and service was generally good with one long period of the server being away. Â Water is refilled quickly and whoever brings out a dish explains it to you and recommends how best to eat it. Â The staff are professionally dressed.Ambiance: Â is hip, classy, and open. Â However, the crowd noise and music are on the loud side, so this is not a great place to enjoy a quiet conversation with friends or a date.Value: Â it's pricey as one would expect for this type of trendy establishment, however, the valet parking is ridiculous. Â $10 for a guy to park the car a few feet away from the entrance of the restaurant? Â Definitely get street parking if you come here!"
"The Girl & The Girl is a cute tapas restaurant in West Loop that I enjoyed dining at, however I don't see myself running to come back anytime soon. Â After researching a ton of restaurants to take my boyfriend to for his birthday, I finally decided on Girl & The Goat over RPM (still kicking myself in the butt for it! lol). Â This restaurant is nice, but definitely all the hype....we ordered 4 small plates and a bread plate, and still left hungry wanting more. Â They even recognized his Bday by bringing out a complimentary dessert, which was nice. Â All in all, the food was good, and the place is cute, but its not the type of place that I would probably come back to."
"If I had one meal left on earth, I would eat it here. I don't know how else to tell you. This is perfection."
"I have been saving my first review for something special and my dining experience at Girl & The Goat last night definitely won that honor.Being that this was my second to last week of living in Chicago, it was the perfect choice to go out with a bang and leave with fond memories of the most exceptional culinary offerings available in this city. My only question was - why did I wait till I had to move before visiting this fine establishment?We were seated within two minutes of our reservation, which is always a nice touch in a busy restaurant. Our server was incredibly knowledgeable; answering all of our questions regarding the cocktail and food menu. I really appreciate it when a restaurant takes the time to introduce the food and drinks to the wait staff so that they can give their personal recommendations. It's just good business when you can convince me to order something off the menu when otherwise I might have passed on. As you might already know, Girl & The Goat serves up locally sourced food. Most websites call it Contemporary American, but you can say it matches more to farmland or rustic palates. Almost every dish we had came with some sort of veggie, nut or berry, which I preferred as a filler over your traditional starches. The food comes in tapas form, served one to two plates at a time, so that you are not rushed when tasting each individual offering. Last night, we were fortunate enough to taste the following:Appetizer -Raw Kusshi Oysters - delicious flavor, straight out of the ocean briny taste. They even scrubbed the shell. Mud is such a pet peeve of mineStecca Bread - that sweet garlic puree and butter is a match made in heaven!Tapas -Mushroom Ragout - for a mushroom lover, this was a delightGrilled Baby Octopus - not bad, but wished there was more octopus, maybe my friends scooped it all upDiver Scallops - perfectly done, the avocado and kimchee medley the scallops sat on really helped add an additional level of creaminess and flavorSugo - not a big standout, found it a tad salty for my tastesDuck Tongue - interesting, but the tongue was deep fried, so it could have been anything thereWood Oven Roasted Pig Face - the server recommended that we mash everything together to kind of meld the flavors together. I really like how the egg yolk and potatoes stix lent texture to the dishCrisp Braised Pork Shank - Yes!!! It was my second most favorite dish. The naan and that pureed butternut squash. I could eat this all day.Goat Loin - it isn't on the online menu, but it came with the same pairings as the Goat Heart that is on the menu. For me, this was the star of the night - it was near perfect; I wished I had some bread to sop up that au jus! Top marks for this one Ms. Stephanie Izard!Dessert -Between the three of us, we still found room for dessert, which I ordered Miso-Butterscotch Budino. Absolutely fantastic! As I look back at the menu, I was wondering what that crunchy delicious goodness that was generously sprinkled on top was... Bacon Toffee??? Kudos my friends...Like I mentioned at the start, overall this meal was so fantastic that I had to give it my first Yelp review spot. Kind of like naming your first child after your personal idol. It was just that good. My one and only recommendation is to switch from the linty napkins to something that doesn't pill up. I understand that it adds to the experience, just another pet peeve of mine. Bottom line, if you live in Chicago, or plan to visit Chicago, make a reservation! You will not regret it. Bring a few friends, just so that you can sample more dishes and even try the goat leg. I must do this next time... Girl & The Goat, thank you for providing such an awesome experience. It will be a long time before I find a restaurant that could replace the impressions you've left on me last evening."
"My husband and I went in on a busy Saturday evening without a reservation as our first time at Girl and the Goat. Â Like all the other posts have mentioned, they serve what they call ""small"" dishes to be shared amongst everyone in categories of Vegetables, Fish, and Meat as well as evening specials. Â Our evening specials consisted of bread, oysters, and goat. Â We ordered the Pretzel bread, Roasted Cauliflower, Grilled Baby Octopus, Ham Frites, Lamb Tartare, and Crisp Braised Pork Shank.Would I go back? Â Nah, the flavors just didn't meld with my palate. Â I kept trying to figure out the food and the thought behind it. Â To me, it seemed like a bunch of great ingredients prepared well and thrown together that ends up being a not-so-great dish. Â The food was way too greasy for me. Â I, also, thought the portions were huge. Â I would have preferred smaller portions with lower prices so I could have room try a bit of everything."
"WAY OVER RATED!!!! I work in the industry and have tasted Chicago's finest, and This place doesn't make my top 5 by a longshot. Â Flavors were bland and muted, combinations worked but nothing was note worthy. Â I just wasted my bday dinner at this place! Go to Purple Pig if you want a similar menu that actually has flavor(and salt)! Â NOT WORTH THE 4 MONTH WAIT!!!!!!!!!"
The pigface was by far the best item we tried. Â Everything else was great too. Â I highly recommend the goat empanadas and the green beans as well. Â One of the best restaurants in Chicago!
"Its actually been a while since I've been here, but Im assuming its still awesome. My only complaint is that like all super popular places the process for making a reservation and getting a table is needlessly difficult. Reservations always seem to be for months out, yet Ive seen it on several occasions not completely full. One positive side to this though is I am yet to sit more than 50 minutes in the bar/waiting area for a table when Ive shown up without a reservation. In fact after doing this a few times, I stopped in with ni reservation on a Friday night and was told there was no way I could get a table within the next two hours....about forty minutes later we were at a table. I suppose there is no real way to handle waiting list that makes everyone happy, but it just seems like the way they do it is a little dishonest. I suppose if they told everyone they they could really get in if they just waited around, and everyone did then it really would be a 4 hour wait.Enough on the reservations...the food is awesome! If you like meet, then you can't go wrong here. If your a vegetarian, you'll probably be a little disappointed in your options. The reason I haven't been back in a while is a girl who's been going out with us is vegetarian so Girl and the Goat is quickly axed from our list of options when she's with us.The set-up makes for a good atmosphere and its a nice touch of being able to see the kitchen in action but not having to watch the food completely made right i your face like a lot of places seem to have. The Chicago Â iron chef girl (I don't know her name) who runs the place is usually there. She took a picture with a friend of mine a few couple years ago. I was kind of impressed by how much Ive seen here there actually cooking. It shouldn't really be all that strange, she runs the place, but the menu is simple enough that Im sure a well trained staff could give her the option to be there in celebrity name only while she vacations on a beach somewhere, but she's always there, working.Besides the headache to get a table, I do love it here. Its a great place to take an out of town visitor."
"I really had high hopes for this place. I really really did! But I just wasn't impressed. I get it, everyone is trying to be the next best thing and think out of the box. Create these great hipster places and try to be ""different"" it just didn't work for me here. And...it normally does. The ambiance is great and the presentation is wonderful, but I just don't really get the hype.I tried things that were out of the box and I will say the goat tongue dish is good. Everything else just didn't seem to be very flavorful and as amazing as I would have hoped. To sum it up, the cocktails were great and a couple of the dishes were ok, but just didn't hit the spot for me."
"Stephanie did one helluva job with this place - wow! Â The combination of ingredients in every item on the menu provided an unending explosion of flavor bursting in your mouth. Â Had too much to eat, but that means that I can provide a more thorough review for you! Â The menu could have had a few more items on it, but given the care and customization put into creating every single item, this isn't really a bad thing. Â Also, this is supposed to be family-style dining, but with the size of the servings it's more like tapas-style.Now, on to the food... Walter's Chicken was the favorite entree of everyone at the table - DEE-lish! Â The squish-squash bread was an excellent choice (if I do say so), serves with an oily quince spread and a pecan butter spread. Â The chickpea somethingorother was very good, with the goat feta and spicy crusted chickpeas delighting everyone. Â The lamb-sausage stuffed calamari was my least favorite dish, and I am glad that I ate it BEFORE learning what ""sweetbreads"" are. Â LOL!Overall, this place truly has a ""top chef"" with creative options available to please everyone in your party!"
"Another amazing meal -- so consistent, this place -- made that much moreso by our server, Veronica. We asked her to help us fall in love with the food all over again, and she did that and more. Now we love her. Veronica, hopefully that's not too weird."
"Everyone's already covered the popular stuff (pig face, cauliflower, etc.) so I will comment on something that might get overlooked:The Kalbi Short Ribs - Not even for the ribs; they come served on a bed of corn on the cob slices and OMG...something about the sweetness of the corn combined with the fat and saltiness from the meat above forms a perfect explosion of flavors such that I had not thought possible from a humble bite of corn.^Get it, be blown away, and thank me"
"Only after the fact did I realize that this is probably Chicago's most talked about restaurant, run by a chef of Top Chef-fame, usually requiring a reservation two months or so ahead of time. A friend in town had arranged a table for a few of us that happened to visiting simultaneously. So I was mainly hungry when I came here, but very quickly started to appreciate my (and of course everyone's) luck. Food is served as shared plates, tapas-style - very rich and novel in taste though simple in form. Enjoyed the fact that the dishes were not conformed to one type of kitchen, though I missed there wasn't more goat cheese involved. Service, atmosphere and selection of drinks were extremely satisfying. If ever going back to Chicago I'll make sure to make my own reservation."
"It's not like I really need to review this place considering it's track record, but I do want to say the Lamb Tartar is a MUST - it will wow your senses!I hope to be visiting Chicago again soon, simply for this restaurant."
"I have been to Girl & the Goat twice, and both times I was pretty blown away. First, getting reservations is a total pain in the ass but I promise it's worth it. I booked online via OpenTable several months in advance but we were able to get some respectable times.The food is served family style and the waiter recommended 2 or 3 dishes per person. For that reason, I would recommend going with a group of 4 to 8 people so that you can try a lot more stuff.Some of the menu items that I would recommend include:- Green beans (I know, I know. Green beans usually suck but the waiter talked me into these and they hit the spot. Try them out even if you would never normally order green beans).- Steamed mussels were totally awesome, the piece of meat was a big as a small thumb. Mmmmmm.- Ham frittes (fries deep fried in ham lard, how can you go wrong?!)- Goat rilette empanadas are not to be missed.- And of course the pig face. There is not much more I can say that others haven't already. It sounds gross, but trust me it's money.My only gripe is pretty minor, the restaurant uses some type of wood burning oven so my coat stunk like a campfire for a few days. Not cool.Other than that, the Girl and the Goat is a ""must try"" restaurant, I'm already looking forward to going back!"
"Pig face never tasted so good, great service. Only downside is how loud it is in there."
"I enjoyed this place tremendously. I thought it would be anticlimactic with all the hype. But it was great. Snagged a last minute reservation on a Monday night. we thought 5pm would be too early but depending on how much you order you could be there forever. We ordered 5 dishes as our waitress suggested. Roasted beets. Delicious. I LOVE beets. Very fresh with an avocado dressing. Very light and a great starter. Baby octopus. Served with bacon. Crisp beans. Pistachios. Soooo good. Very savory but lots of different textures Â My favorite of em all. Roasted goat belly. I grew up on goat and hated it but we were at the restaurant and decided to try a dish. Served over a purÃ©e of parsnip (?) and with butter, crab and lobster. It was amazing. Very tender but not as gamey as I've had it in the past. The hubs loved this dish the best. Chicken. Cooked in Asian spices. Almost like Peking duck. Crispy on the outside served with fried pickles, a spicy dip, an aioli, and some grilled naan. Delicious again and the hubs made a naan pizza with his saved chicken skin, some thigh meat and the sauces. The last was Sudo. A stew of beef, lamb and pork served over pappardelle pasta. If I wasn't already stuffed I may have enjoyed this more. But it had some gooseberries I think, which was a delightful surprise. And of course we had dessert. Some butternut malasadas with baked apple and bourbon whipped cream. Delicious. They were served warm and I almost detected a spice to them. But it was perfect. Everything was tapas style. And served 1 by 1. Not everything bombards you. You really get a chance to enjoy every dish. The waitress and bus boy do a great job refilling water, clearing plates and handing us new ones for each dish. Very impressed. It was bustling as we left around 7pm. But it was great energy. And not too loud or too dark in there. What gave it the 5th star in my rating was playing some Tribe Called Quest. Damn stephanie, what do you know bout some Tribe?!"
"Green beans were fantastic; even looked up the recipe online afterwards. Everything we ordered was extremely extremely delicious.Went to Purple Pig a few weeks after and, although solid, couldn't meet our expectations after Girl and the Goat.Decor is nice. If you haven't made reservations weeks in advance, go right when they open and you'll be seated without a wait. Did that twice, both on weekends, and was able to score a table.Great for any special occasion."
"1150 reviews of G and G and counting? Â Chicago is gaga over the girl, but can you blame us? Â Chef Izard more than lives up to the hype of her Top Chef honors.Unwilling to wait 475 months for a proper reservation, we arrived promptly at 4:30 on an early Friday afternoon, doing our best impersonation of Florida retirees, and demanded a table. Â And by demanded, of course, I mean inquired politely with an expectation of acquiescence. Â Acquiesced we were. Â Seated on the raised area adjacent to the front windows, we had excellent views of the dining room, and our adventure began.The food, without expectation, was stupendous. Â We began with two breads, the bretzel and the mushroom, and both were light, warm, and refreshing. Â What really made them worth the money was the spreads, which included an aioli, a mustard spread, and a heavenly thousand island spread wholly unlike the bottled junk you'll find at Jewels.On to the meat. Â The grilled baby octopus was tender and juicy and overflowing in the bowl, perfectly accompanied by rich and complex flavors of guanciale and pistachio. Â The goat carpacchio was melt in your mouth delicious, and if it wasn't for some unbelievable beef carpacchio I'd had in St Martin the week before it would have been the best I've ever had. Â We continued on to the escargot ravioli, which is almost overwhelmingly earthy but nonetheless delicious because of that, and the mushroom ragout, which was similarly earthy and delicious. Â We finished with the goat pork belly, which was also good, but, like almost all pork belly dishes, too heavy on fat and gelatin. Â Yet, I keep ordering it. Â One day I'll learn. Â All in all, a delicious, complex dinner that satisfied completely.The wine list at GG's is full of intrigue, if a little light on Rhones. Â They do, however, stock a lovely Cabernet Franc from the Loire. Â  Chef Izard's menu practically demands a wine such as this, and I cannot recommend too highly. Â As you may know, Cab Franc is having a moment, stepping out from behind the shadows of Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot in Bordeaux wines and generating rave reviews in the Loire Valley, the Off Broadway storefront of France, and I for one could not be happier. On its own, Cab Franc is everything an Old World wine should be - chewy, earthy, unrefined, and demanding food, like a foul mouthed French hobo. Â What really makes me swear in delight, however, is Chef Izard's personal bourbon selection. Â Like so many Chicago restaurants, she has a hotline straight into bluegrass country and several special bourbon selections from the finest Kentucky distillers. Â It is with bittersweet elation, my noble bourbon boozers, that you'll peruse her bourbon list, savoring the vast quality while saddened that you can only opt for a taste of one, perhaps two, barrels, before and after your meal, lest your dinner become a cloud of fog off the Appalachians.Our server was well versed in the menu and very friendly. Â An insider's tip - if you want to eat there, don't take no for an answer, just show up - apparently, tables routinely pop up and there is a communal seating that can usually accommodate surprise guests throughout the night. Â And if you need to wait a spell for a table, you'll just have to hang out in the bar and sample a glass or three of Chef Izard's personal bourbon selection.So you don't have to be choosy, after all."
"I am a lover and a fan. The food is great, the staff is warm and accommodating."
"The food and service was excellent. Difficult to get a reservation, but well worth the wait. Highly recommend."
"Duh, it's great! Â Pig face, green beans, grilled calamari, any goat special! Stephanie Izard, oh how I love thee...one day maybe I can actually get a table here after 5 PM and before 10 PM."
"Excellent! Scored a prime time spot for 2 using another online reservation site :) and my first impression was very positive. Loved the ambiance and energy. Ordered ""Not Campbell Soup"" bread, sauteed green beans, goat empanadas, kona kampachi crudo, grilled baby octopus, Â pig face (originally ordered pork shank but it was 86'd so server suggested this as alternative), and strawberry parfait for dessert. The ""standouts still thinking abouts"" were the goat empanadas, and the green beans! I definitely would like to return to Chicago and visit Girl & the Goat again. Service was outstanding and professional. I would recommend this place to my friends."
"The thing I regret is not that I ordered excessively , but that my stomach is so restricting!! Okay, yes, I'm a fan who followed Stephanie on Top Chef. But I did try to erase any preconceived notion. What more can I add that 1271 reviews haven't said already?? The best thing is to forget about all of it and just write a review based on my experience. I strongly suggest a reservation. I got one about 2-3 months ago. The ambiance is surprisingly very relaxed and fun, with cool music in the background. The service is perfect. The food... the food is as good as good can be. You don't have to have a refined palate to relish the menu items. The chickpea fritters are totally worth the hype. The roasted cauliflower will make people who don't like veggies start loving them. The sweet potato gratin and sautÃ©ed skate in sage-brown butter sauce were super rich. The chocolate-chile gelato.... yum yum yum. They have a great mixologist too so, definitely try the cocktails. So proud of Ms Izard!!"
"The GIrl and the Goat has been on my Yelp Bookmark list since it has opened and I desperately wanted to love love LOVE it as Stephanie is my fav Top Chef winner to date.While the food is good, it is not really mindblowing and I think it comes down to the fact that at the end of the day, the high turnaround that the restaurant is trying to achieve (and who can blame them when they can make more $$) makes it a bit of a machine, losing the elegant touches of Izard herself. Â Gastropubs are a dime a dozen in LA, and while TGATG is a a good one, it falls on par with many of those back at home as well. Â I do love the decor and the ambiance of the entire place, I just wish the food and knocked me off my feet a little more."
"Some of the best food I have ever eaten. Period.We went for my wife's birthday and I had to make the reservation 4-5 months in advance but it was well worth it! The service was great - a far cry from where we went last year for her birthday (hint: check my previous reviews... more specific hint: Fish Bar)We shared somewhere around 6 plates (they are small, so don't jump to conclusions) - one of them being a complementary dish of broccoli with spiced rice krispies! it was fantastic. The goat belly confit and pig face dishes were empeccable, Â but my favorite may have been the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts, mint, and pickled peppers. I bet Peter Piper picked a pack of them.....We sat at a little nook for two that is attached to the kitchen, and we loved sitting there, watching these artists perfect their craft.+1 for the delicious Three Floyds brews on tap. Love some tasty dreadnaught.Would love to go back - so if I reserve today, I can get in somewhere around labor day....Also - street parking around the corner at a meter is your best bet. Just my two cents."
"Can't really add much to what everyone else has said. I had a great experience here and would love to go again. Surprisingly, the pig ear was my least favorite, shishito peppers and mussels were excellent."
"This place is amazing. Walking in the atmosphere was great and they play good Â music. Last night will not be the last time I set foot in this place. It's not like this place needs another rave review, but I figured I'd put my five stars in for Stephanie Izard. Not sure how this place could receive less than 5 stars.Apparently the bread changes everyday. We had the fallcoccia bread. I can't remember what the spread was like but there was also some kind of cranberry sauce to mix with it. This was just the start of a great dinner.The pan fried shishito peppers were probably one of my favorite things that we ordered."
"This is a really laid-back kind of place - especially for what they have going on food-wise and I truly appreciate that. Â We went in ona Friday night early -after about a three month wait to get a table - any table, so we were expecting some pretty fabulous stuff. Â The husband and I are on different planets when it comes to food preferences, so it makes dining at shared plates places a little tough. Â Fortunately, this was not so hard because the portions are not that large. Â So, we got some goat (me), the short ribs (him), fried oysters, a beet bread, and one other plate (his) that I am not remembering and some drinks. Â The waiter tried to convince the husband to eat the green beans (that would be an accomplishment) and comp'ed us a small portion, but I ended up eating what was eaten of them.Overall, the service was really good - not pushy, informative without being pretentious. Â The food was really good, if a little small. Â Husband thought he had better short ribs elsewhere, but they weren't ""bad"". Â End bill was about $175, which seems pretty reasonable given that we had about 5 drinks on top of the food and a ruby port instead of dessert (hooray for Ruby over Tawny).One word of caution - it is hotter than a sauna in there, so wear light clothing - and be prepared to smell like meat when you leave because the smoker pervades the whole place. Â Also really odd that you have to walk way downstairs to the bathrooms that are separately marked little rooms. Â Disorienting in the heat of the place to get back!"
My favorite meal of 2013 so far. Everything was perfect.
"Good, very reasonably priced, our waitress was very nice though I'm not sure that all of them are so good. Â And, she was very nice and funny, but not especially helpful in choosing food from the quite large menu.We ate at the bar, it is very hard to get a seat/table here, but the setup is comfortable to wait for one.I wasn't totally blown away by the food but it's hard to judge a place by only 3 dishes. Â The cocktail I had was very good, though drinks are pricey in general here.Of the 3 dishes, one was pretty great (seafood fideos) , the other 2 were just good, a little too sweet/one-note for me to be overly impressed. Â (green beans & vanilla lobster).It's not trying to be really haute cuisine though, for bar/comfort type food, it's good, and I would like to give it another try sometime."
It was amazing. Everything we had was delicious. Great service. Super fun atmosphere. I cannot wait to go back.
"Lovely atmosphere and delightful cocktails and food. Romantic and casual, the small plates sensual adventurous flavors, and distinct textures are the perfect beginning to an exciting evening with a significant other. Try something from every part of the menu. Pig face is low decadence and the escargot was perfect. plan to stay for a while."
"I think Girl and The Goat is by far the most overrated restaurant in Chicago.I came here with my roommate super excited to finally try the famous Girl and the Goat. I was extremely unimpressed by the food, service, and overall atmosphere.I know that most people come here and share small plates, but my roommate is vegetarian so we decided to order our own dishes. She ordered two vegetarian dishes and I got the Grilled Baby Octopus, Diver Scallops, and Escargot Ravioli. We made it clear to our waitress (who was absentminded and had a bitchy attitude) that we would NOT be sharing and that we each wanted our own dishes. So no, we would NOT like to start with the vegetable dishes. You think she would have communicated that to the kitchen. Nope. My friend got BOTH her vegetable dishes and I literally waited 20 minutes before I got the first of mine. Seriously?? Wtf. So my friend was pretty much done eating by the time my food arrived. As for the food itself, I really didn't like anything. The dish I was most looking forward to (the octopus) was also my least favorite - it had some weird flavoring. Finally, the place was super loud and crammed I could barely go in and out of my seat (and that's not because I'm fat and can't fit into small spaces). And I had to scream to be heard. I would never come back again and I don't get why it has such high ratings."
I really really like there braised pork and for desert the miso butterscotch budino... Wow.
"3.75Goodies:1. Food are tasty. Although a lot of those dishes remind me Chinese food. 2. Servers are nice.Not so happy with:1. Too crowded and too load: walk in without appointment, ended up setting on the lounge (the couch section). Music is very load.2. Considering the quantity of the food and the taste, a little pricy"
Came back from an amazing gastronomic journey.Big thanks to the staff for fitting me in on a last minute reservation.There were so many items that I have never tried on the menu that I was feeling like Andrew Zimmern.Started the meals off from light to heavy.Pan fried duck tongues: Â a nice texture with a delicate flavor. The shiitake mushroom complimented things well.Confit goat belly: Â a nice portion of goat belly. The overall taste was somewhat overpowered by the lobster and crab. The bourbon butter was Â pretty tasty. Wood oven roasted pig face: Â my favorite dish of the night. Don't worry a whole pig head does not come with the meal. Â Just two patties of porkie goodness. Â The flavor of the pork is really enhanced by the sunny side up egg. Â Make sure you mash up everything to get the total effect. The soft texture of the pig face intertwined with the gooeyness of the egg is balanced by the amazing crunch of potato stix. Braised pork shank: a generous portion of shank that has great consistency. The kimchee sauce was delectable for dipping. Â The recipe for this is somewhere on twitter.At this point in the night I wished that I had an extra stomach to continue my quest but had to throw in towel during the shank.Thanks Chef Izard and staff for providing a great gastronomic opportunity.
"I tired to make a reservation last time I was here. No luck.So I went home and made one two-and-a-half-months in advance. Â And let me tell you, it was worth the wait.The plates are ""tapas"" style. Â So small plates, you order a lot and try a bunch of different things.We ordered 8 different items - take a look here:mrsjennifercook.com/girlâ¦"
"I love this place! I wish I could eat here all the time! The service is impeccable and food is divine. Â In the two times I have been here I have tried: the Sweet Potato Gratin, Escargot Ravioli, Ham Frites, the Pig Face, Beef Tongue, Pork Shank, Green Beans and the Mushroom Ragout. Â The pig face and pork shank have been my favorites and typically I am not one for pork products, so that speaks volumes to me about Stephanie Izard and her ability to make magic happen in the kitchen. Â The only dish I wasn't crazy about were the Ham Frites, they were a little too salty for my liking. Love this place and can't wait to return."
"This is honestly one of the best meals I've had in my life. Â Was travelling to chicago for a conference for one night only and a friend recommended it highly.Got there 1030 on a saturday and my friend and I sat right down outside. Â It's a bench, so you're sitting right next to other people. Â The inside seemed too loud for me (I'm 33, so not too old) so the outside was perfect.The server was a big foodie like myself and he definitely guided our culinary experience. Â The drunk guy next to me recommended the Pig Face so that was one of our dishes, then a scallops with duck was divine and broccoli. Â Overall, one of the best meals of my life, seriously."
"Surprised my girlfriend with a reservation here on our anniversary and I think she almost cried from excitement. Â This place is quite trendy and filled with younger people enjoying delicious food. Â The portions are a bit smaller but only because the flavors are so big! Â We started out with the chickpea fritter and finished with the pig face which was incredible. Â Beer selection is pretty extensive.If you come here hungry, expect to spend some money but know you will leave satisfied."
"I completely love this place 100%! Must haves include: pig face, green beans, and budino."
"Reservations for 5. Monday night. 7:15pm (YAY for the 400th review!)Ever since reading about the new kid in town this past summer, I've been itching to score a much desired table for dinner at G&G. After one failed attempt in September, I was determined to make this one successful. Reservations were arranged approximately 4-6 weeks in advance for the prime dinner hours. Battling through rush hour traffic into the city and rendevouzing everyone together during a classic chicago snowstorm in december, we were valeted and seated promptly. Dark wooden panels with details of large mirrors, pine cones, artful branches, and a large drawing of the goat gave the masculine environment very feminine touches, further enhancing the hip, cool, chic ambience. The open kitchen allowed patrons to visualize all the workers in action. Ms. Stephanie herself was also working the line, making sure that every finished dish met her standards. Small plates consumed:squish squash bread . pecan brown butter . quince oil""not campbells"" . tomato bread . mushroom butter . tomato oilsauteed green beans . fish sauce vinaigrette . cashewsroasted cauliflower . pickled peppers . pine nuts . mintkabocha squash ravioli . mushroom raisin ragout . brussels leaves . shroom creme fraichhamachi crudo . crisp pork belly . aji aioli . caperberriesseared scallops . pumpkin brandade . pecans . fried brussel sprouts . tarragon . pomegranatesauteed skate . albacore salsify salad . blood orange . spiced hazelnuts""raw shibumi"" oysters . radish mignonette . tarragongrilled skirt steak . chiogga beets . house pickes . wilted romaine . salted goat milk caramelwood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stixgrilled pork ribs . crispy pork ear slaw . grilled scallion vinagrettewalter's chicken . confit empanada . root vegetable caponata . caper vinaigretteblood orange sorbet . parsnip pot de creme . pistachio cake . three sisters cornmeal crust Every dish was innovative and creative as seasonally available produce are harmonized together to create new palatable flavors. From the fun pairings of butter and oil with bread, to the warm and surprisingly ""coconut-y"" hints of the squash ravioli, to the simple yet complex flavors of the grilled skirt steak, and the phenomenal ending with the blood orange sorbet (which we all shared as a culinary moment together and DIED by its shear amazingness), G&G did not disappoint. Dividing the small plates to fifths allowed us to experience spoonfuls, forkfuls of flavor explosions, discuss what we liked and what we loved, and move on to another curiously exciting dish, thus making it a fantastic choice for groups.Our server was really friendly, knowledgeable, personable and really enhanced the experience. In the thick of the dinner madness, he would repeatedly apologize because ""the kitchen is slammed"" but heck, in presence of good company, none of us noticed. Water glasses were never empty and dishes were always served with short explanations before we devoured each one clean.Even the next morning, E and I talked about the dinner and we both agreed, another trip needs to be made to try the ever evolving menu."
"No complaints whatsoever. Â This restaurant was wonderful, with amazing food, delicious drinks and a cool relaxed atmosphere. Â We thought that it may be overrated but so not the case- not to be missed!"
"Girl and The Goat was very disappointing. I am not sure what the hype is.... I was SO excited to try this uber popular restaurant.... As a Chicago native, this restaurant is not even on the same level as many other excellent fine dining establishments in the city.It was dark and the music was so loud. The descriptions of the food on the menu were not true representations of what you were actually served. The waitress suggested we ordered 10 dishes and even said that might not be enough food for the 5 people. By about the fifth dish we Were stuffed. It was way too much food, I can't even imagine what else we could have ordered if we had let the waitress have her way. By the end of the evening we were struggling to even look at the food because it all was so greasy and unappealing. A majority of the food was fried, if the main portion wasn't fried something on the plate was. Everything was greasy, overly salted and sloppy, by the end everything tasted the same. It was the first time we did not want to even order dessert!! The waitress was pretty inattentive. The food kept coming out of the kitchen at lightning speed, so it was hard to enjoy my company and conversation when dish after dish kept coming from the kitchen. Even after asking the waitress to slow down the food, it just kept coming. It was an okay experience. I could see why people like to eat there, it is in a lively area and the food is interesting, not so expensive either. Compared to other restaurants of the same caliber in Chicago, Girl and the Goat does not compare."
"Love all the places I've eaten over the years in Chicago but this deserves a yelp . Â Been a cook/chef for 14 years and I must say this is the worst meal I've had in the city. Table next to the bar with bar patrons ass in your face while you dine. Obscure wine list, wine taken from the table between pours? Very hard up selling by the waitstaff. The food.. well no flavor. The Â octopus was good ,but the pig face was a joke. Don't waste you're net here."
"I took my girlfriend here for our anniversary, and it was an amazing experience. It was her first time, and my second time, although my first romantic endeavor (I ate with three other dudes last time). The dining experience this time was more amazing, but I will say - the more people you go with, the better. I'd say four was a pretty good number, we shared 9 dishes, wine, bread and two desserts and each got out of there for under $100, but with two people, we could only eat four dishes. Not terrible, but you definitely want to try as many dishes as possible.We started out with two expertly mixed cocktails and a bottle of recommended Aligote Wine, which our server offered to put aside in a chiller, which allowed us to enjoy at our own pace.Our first course was the delicious onion bread, which comes with a tomato dressing and taragon butter. Our waitress recommended we mixed the two together, and the look on my girlfriend's face said it all. The bread is so soft that it breaks apart when you close your lips, and it's a wonderful taste.Our first main dish was the goat cheese tortellini, which comes highly recommended. It's small, but each tortellini is so full that it packs quite the punch. We followed that up with the pig face, which comes with a sunny side egg, tamarind, maple and a few other things. I had it last time, but any goers shouldn't be scared - it comes out looking like pulled pork, and you make it into a hash, so it kind of has the consistency of hash browns and eggs with a little different taste, which is refreshing.Our next course was the broccoli, with rogue smokey bleu and crispies. What a delicious flavor. It's got quite a kick, but not one that burns and lingers, and the flavor is very grill/meat like without actually being meat. The best broccoli we've ever had, hands down. Our final dish were the grilled pork ribs with tomatillo-mushroom slaw & grilled scallion vinaigrette. Awesome, but we were starting to get full so we didn't finish.Our dessert was unbelievable. I was kind of into the chocolate cake, but our waitress recommended the rhubarb. I'm not a huge rhubarb fan but this was unbelievable. It comes in a mason jar with champagne sauce, caramel merengue, and a frozen parfait and it's delicious. It's tiny for sure, but even with two people you won't have any complaints.The wait staff is all helpful - the waitress was attentive, kind and helpful, and the servers and bussers are polite and knowledgeable. They work well as a team to make sure you're taken care of and happy. And we were for sure.The only complaint I can have is that, even booking two months ahead, we could only get an 11:15 reservation for Saturday night. It's not the worst thing for a restaurant to be busy - however, I wish I could go more regularly and without a reservation THAT early in advance. Not the restaurant's problem, obviously..."
"There is a secret vegan menu, but I wish it would remain secret. I found the chick pea and eggplant dishes flavorful, but nothing to write home about. The drinks were tasty, but not worth the price. I practically twisted my friend's arm to visit with me (she had been here once already) and now I know why. It's vegetarian friendly, but there will be no pandering, no vegetarian worship, or even outright vegetarian culinary respect - just to be clear."
"Maybe I do not have an accurate taste of this place as I ahd only and appetizer and a dessert, but I ordered the oysters that boasted horseradish and they were warm, watery and had ZERO flavor.We also ordered the blueberry cake with goat cheese and brown sugar, the top tasted like a burnt smore and the goat cheese was really overwhelming and while I love goat cheese I felt it should have been toned down a bit to go better with the sourness of the blueberries.The service was good and the atmosphere was great, maybe I would give it anothr chance"
Very New York experience. Gorgeous rustic restaurant with fantastic tapas. There's a reason it was voted the 4th best restaurant in the country by TripAdvisor.
"This place doesn't need another review as it's packed and booked for months at a time, but my friend really wanted to write about one specific thing:We had dinner here in November, and my friend is vegetarian. Â Our waiter (I wish I could remember his name) literally took her menu and crossed out everything she should avoid, and explained every item and gave some recommendations. Â We had been there once before for appetizers (get the green beans!!! Â they are the best!) and this time we went with several recommended items and we loved every one. Â She had never had someone go thru a menu with her like that to make sure she had a good experience, and has been talking about it ever since. Â In fact at the end when she told the waiter how much she appreciated it, he even said he's not the only one who does that. Â (And, as I was skimming the reviews to try to find our waiter's name, I noticed another review mentioning their waiter highlighting items on the menu).Great food. Â Excellent service. Â Wish it wasn't so hard to get a reservation. Â In my opinion the more people in your group, the better it will be because you will be able to try more things. Â And order the green beans!!! Â I wish they had take out!!PS Loved Stephanie on Top Chef."
"In-fucking-credible!Everything about this place was great! Relaxed environment, great servers, fast service, modern decor and most importantly stunning food. They change their menu frequently which is great if you want to frequent this restaurant Â and get a new menu each time. If these dishes are still there they are a must get!-Roasted Cauliflower- pickled petter-pine nuts-mint-goat, pork, and veal sugo-papparedelle-rosemary-seared scallops-brown butter XO-goat sausage-white shrimp- shitakes-winter squashIt is on the more expensive side but trust me, it is worth it! Â The portions are not too small like a lot of tapas style places and the dishes are full of unique flavors that will blow you away.I recommend this place to any food fanatic!!!"
"Yeah, it's good. Â Was in Chicago on business and decided to give it a try. Â No reservation but got lucky with a seat at the bar. Â Great crowd. Â Wood-fred oyster appetizer was very good, roasted beet salad was excellent (enough to share with someone) and the soft shell crab was delicious. Â I'll definitely go back. It's busy, a bit loud but fun. Â I have to say though, that the bartenders/waitress, while nice, were not overly attentive nor super friendly. Â Definitely worth a visit, but make sure you have a reservation otherwise it's a roll of the dice waiting for a seat at the bar or lounge to open up. Â Only carried one brand of vodka. Â I ordered Belvedere and the bartender just said ""I can give you vodka on the rocks"" - no explanation, no ""would that be ok?"" - thus my rating of the rather unfriendly bartenders."
"I went to G&tG about 2 years ago for the first time. Awesome, amazing. I've been 3 times in the past 6 months, and every time I go it is worse than the last time I went. It's not awful, just not as good.The pig face, which used to be amazing, has made its way into the mediocre category. The menu says that it is supposed to be a pork patty, and the last time I went, it came out and was not in a patty form whatsoever, and was marbled with fat and gristle. Then, the server had the audacity to challenge me when I asked to have it taken off the bill. I won't go here again."
"There is no doubt that Stephanie Izard's Girl and the Goat fulfills the expectations that the reviews and the news articles have set up. We made reservations in August for a primetime Saturday night table in December and now we all know why.I don't think I've been to a restaurant where the food was more appropriate for the small plates format because it is so flavorful that you don't need more than a few angelic bites before you sit back in your chair marveling at what you have just tasted.We went with six people which worked out nicely because two dishes each barely covered a good sample from the V vegetable, F fish, M meat and G goat sections of the menu. The Pig Face dish and the ribs are musts in the meats. The goat empanada was also a standout along with the beets and green beans.We did also try two of their home baked breads the pretzel and the apple complete with two sauces/butters each which were delicious. It may be popular to skip dessert but you worked too hard to get into this place to quit before the end of the game and there are only four desserts each night so get them all and you wont be sorry.The team at GatG is excellent from the host stand to the bar, waitstaff and bus staff. They all worked together to make the diners experience one to remember. Their new lunch spot The Little Goat is already being touted as one of the countries most anticipated new restaurants for next year so whether you show up at 4:30 when they open, eat at the bar or wait months for a primetime res, get in there because you must try this fantastic restaurant."
Been here twice and counting...... If you haven't had a chance to check this restaurant you are definitely missing out.
"One word to describe the food here... Amazing! There was not a single dish we ordered that I did not like. We started with the focaccia bread with a mushroom butter and onion jam, sooo good. The special's we ordered were the wood fired wiley point oysters and the confit goat belly, both were great. I really like the sauteed green beans, the seared scallops and ham frittes. The steamed mussels were out of this world and the kalbi style beef ribs were one of my favorites. The best dish and the staple of this place is by far the wood over roasted pig face. You cannot come here without trying this dish. I also got 2 desserts that were okay, but next time I'll skip the sweets and order a second pig face. SOOOO GOOD!"
"The ambiance, food and service all were great. Visiting Chicago for a conference and went here on a recommendation from a foodie friend and was not disappointed. I was very lucky to get a reservation the day before I wanted to go on Open Table, the table next to us said they waited 4 months! I recommend the Pig Face, it is amazing!"
"The food was pretty excellent. Â The price was pretty high. Â Basically if you look at the menu, you would think it's average priced for that kind of restaurant, but you really need to order 2-3 things per person, as portions are pretty small. Â I went with a buddy and we shared everything, bill was ~$140 w/tip. Â We got some bread, which was pretty good, can't remember what it was called. Â The dumplings were just OK. Â the pig face was excellent. Â The goat neck was excellent...can't remember what else we got. Â We were in town for business so we didn't have reservations. Â We were told to wait 90 min for a table or sit a a community table right way. Â We chose the community table and it was fine. Â A little awkward, since there was a party of 4 and another couple at the table with us, all at different stages of our meals. Â The service was excellent. Â If you are in town, I'd recommend trying it out as an experience. Â If I lived there, I'm not sure how often I would go back."
"This place is way overrated.The food is overpriced.The music is too loud. I tired 10 items but nothing is impressive. One of the most popular dish - pig face - Come on, did the cook ever try the real delicious pig face?? I've tried pig face when I traveled abroad. There are many different ways to make it tasty. I was expecting something similar in G&G, but I was so disappointed because it just tastes like regular pork you can eat everywhere.P.S. Please turn down the music. I can hardly hear my friend who's sitting across the table. I need to shout during the whole meal. After I came out from the restaurant, my throat was hurting so much!"
"To not copy what other said, I will keep this short. The food is generally good but several dishes were very salty. Â Two of us ordered 7-8 dishes and it was probably one too many. Â Very noisy restaurant."
"Excellent food. Â The veggie dished (cauliflower, brocolli, etc) were actually my favorites of the night, which is saying a lot as I'm a big meat eater. Â Wine list is decent and desserts were not at good as rest of menu. Â One of the best meals I've had in Chicago, if not the best."
"Great. Great. GREAT! Â Can't say enough about this place. Many free tasting samples. Our server, Antonio, the BEST. Â We showed up early, gave us the one of two kitchen-side tables. Got to see everything made from scratch. Favorite dish, Sugo. Broad noodles made right in front of us. Antonio also took time to make us a list of his favorite other restaurants in Chicago. Great night."
"Thought we would check this place out since we live 5 mins away. Â We decided to walk in since there were no more reservations available 2.5 hrs before and after 7pm for two nights. Â However, we were told it would be a 1 hr wait to be seated at a table so we chose to have our dinner in the lounge area. Â It wasn't that bad if you arrive before 7pm but as people sit around you on the oversized lounge couch, conversations can be heard.Our waitress was helpful and explained the menu to us since it was our first time and we weren't forgotten since we sat in the lounge. Â The food was great. Â I like small portions to share since dining should be an experience. Â We had:Culture bread- the spread and the bread were so goodRoasted cauliflower- good except for the hidden spices. Â I unknowingly ate one and almost choked.Escargot ravioli- eh, very bland and I do like escargotGoat meat- forgot the exact name but it is meant to be forgotten, it tasted weird, never againLamb ribs- delish very well marinatedPear wonton- if the wonton skin was soft it would be betterMay come back if I can get a table reservations."
"Add another person to the band wagon. This place is worth the attention that it's received. Believe the hype and check out the amazing food they have to offer. You'll have a hard time finding anything you won't like and I guarantee this place will push the boundaries of your pallet and any pickiness you have about your food. You can't help but step out of those confines and you'll never look backOk enough chat. The menu and ordering style is designed to get you to order multiple plates similar to tapas. They say about 4 plates per person, and we did 9 plates, two of which were desserts, and one which was an order of bread. Oh man that bread was amazing. Don't worry about being timid on what to order, from my experience and from a friend whose a frequent visitor, the wait staff are extremely helpful. That's why it gets the five stars, excellent food Â and excellent service. Also while you're waiting for your table try one of there amazing cocktails."
"A must try! We were visiting Chicago on a Saturday and didn't have reservations. We showed up early, the place was packed already, but we were seated fairly quickly (in about 10 min! We were told that we had to leave before the rsvp'd party arrived, but that was plenty of time and we were not rushed). The waitress was helpful in helping us decide on our dishes since the dishes were pretty unique. The cauliflower and bread were delish! Â Also ordered the goat belly, pork shank, a fish dish, and ham frites. During my next visit, I wouldn't mind re-ordering these dishes except for the frites. Although pretty tasty, they were just frites.. Can't wait to bring out of town guests here!"
"This place is so overrated. Maybe, because I have had some of the best food in Las Vegas and this place just doesn't equal to par with Vegas but I never had such bland and weird food. The place was extremely packed when we got there and it was soooo loud and I mean LOUD. The tables were all TOO close together where you actually can join the other person's conversation by just whispering. Now the food, the wood grilled oysters were completely bland did not taste like it was smoked. The server recommended the chickpea fritters saying they are popular. It literally tasted like cardboard so gross. The only thing that was decent was the mussels but it was lacking in flavor. The braised beef was not tender and the spices were lacking. Â We had a couple other things but like I said it wasn't good at all and a waste of Â time to explain them. Our server was snobbish and I didn't like that. Will I return heck no so we can spend over $150 no thank you. PROS: Location and decorCONS: Our server, food, price, no privacy"
Awesome like always. I have been there many times. I have tried many things on there menu and have been very statisfied with all of them. I will always go back.
"I am not sure if there are even words to describe the deliciousness of the food at Girl & The Goat other than WOW! Â Two of my friends and I went on a Thursday at 4:30pm because that was the only reservation time we could get for 6 weeks. No we are not 75 yrs old. LOLThe staff was super friendly and when we walked in they immediately took us to our table. Our server greeted us within seconds and I immediately fell in love. Oh Natalie *swoon*...Okay back to my review. We ordered one of the breads of the day. It was an onion bread that was just melt in your mouth. I would have been happy just to eat that for dinner! Then we moved on to the green beans with fish sauce which I was a bit hesitant about my friends insisted and I am so glad they did. It was so amazing! I would have to say my next dish was my favorite. I chose the squash blossom rangoon and thankfully my friend is allergic to seafood so there was more for me!! Sooo good I just kept making ooo'ing and ahhh'ing noises! Â My friends had been there before and loved the smoked chicken so we ordered that and it was, as my mother would say, succulent!! Â OH and I forgot we also had the chickpea fritters which I was delightfully surprised by how excellent they were. And the last thing I think was called pork shank. Again it was absolutely amazing! If you live in or are visiting chicago you must must try girl and the goat! It is hands down one of the best and most creative restaurants in the city! Just make sure to make your reservations far in advance."
Gotta go.
"Girl & The Goat- A fantastic Top Chef experience: familiar ingredients mixed in a complex & ingenious way.In my opinion, worth the hype. I think why GATG is so poplar is because although really well done fine dining gastronomic type places can be nice, it's great to go to a place where you can pronounce and recognize everything on the menu, get amazing flavors and not pay an arm & a leg for it.FOODSauteed Green Beans- My fav dish, all the different flavors are just amazing. Roasted Cauliflower- Another fav, again amazing flavor explosion. (please note this & the GB were a fav amongst many and none of us are GB or Cauli fans)Roasted Oysters- Best oysters I've ever had. Really enjoyed the different flavor of the toppings. They no longer have this on the menu, but I recommend any oysters on their menu. More for seafood fans that enjoy Stephanie's flavor combos, can't speak on sheer oyster quality.Grilled Pork Ribs- I hate pork and this was AMAZING. Very juicy, tender and perfectly seasoned.Grilled Baby Octopus- Didn't really like this one. I had the grilled octopus here about a month ago and loved it. It had corn and lime in it. The one I had on 10/26/11 was a bit salty and lacking in the octopus factor.Smoked Goat Empanadas- Really great.Whole Loup de Mer- Fantastic fish. Creamy sauce. Highly recommendWood Oven Roasted Pig Face- Did NOT like. First, I don't really like pork, and I don't really like deep fried things. Most ppl in my party enjoyed this, but to me it was just simply really deep fried pork. Nothing enjoyable or special.Kalbi Style Beef Ribs- Did not like. To be fair, I'm Korean and unless it's really awesome, Americanzed kalbi is just crap.Apple Butter Bread- Don't get the bread's. Just a waste of stomach space. The bread is really plain and hard and the toppings are just meh. And there is way too much bread and not enough of the spread.Chocolate Bouchon- My least favorite of the desserts, although I loved them all. Just tastes like a really dense and hard chocolate cake with marshmallow fluff and chocolate gelatoPork Fat Doughnuts- Awesome, really loved the unique toppings that accompanied the doughnuts.Apple dessert in Mason Jar- My FAV of the desserts. All the unique flavors together are just amazing: apple, and cream and cheese, and crumbs!Pear Wonton- Awesome. Loved the creamy, fruity & crunchy!SERVICEServers were fantastic. Just what you would expect: knowledgable and seamless. I went with a party of 4 and was told the wait was approx 1 hr. We were able to get a seat in the lounge and have a couple of starters, but the wait ended up being a little over 2 hours. Kind of ridiculous. They could have just played it off, ""Well we are GATG"" (I mean we did just eagerly wait it out and would have waited longer.) But they sincerely apologized and comp'd 2 desserts. The effort to appease an unpleasantry goes a long way.AMBIENCEThe ambience is like the food, very familiar and comforting. I would feel comfortable wearing a dress & heels or coming in a hoodie (I have done both). A busy city dweller like me can really appreciate a place like that."
"wasn't bad, wasn't great either. it's a beautiful bustling restaurant yet i was completely underwhelmed. the $80 per person price tag wasn't quite earned. the best thing we had was the kohlrabi salad. i think that about says it all."
"Overrated. Overhyped. Whatever you call it.After reading tons of reviews and getting a big expectation about to have one of the best meal in my life, I think it is just overhyped. Highly crowded. Nice ambience though. However, the thing is it has a terribly slow service, caused to hate my meal. Waited 25 minutes for dessert! It is hard to call a server because no one is looking for you within the crowd. Disappointed.Cauliflower (4/5)Goat cheese (3/5)Baby octopus (2/5)Goat empanada (5/5)Goat belly (5/5)Beers (4/5)Desserts (2/5)"
"I've heard amazing things about this restaurant as well, but I didn't think I would have the chance to eat here as I'm told they were booked through the next month. However, they do have an open bar first come first serve area that you can try and fight for a seat. I remember it being a complete rainstorm that day and all of our plans for that day were canceled because of it. Despite the rain and it being around 5pm on a weekend, it was still extremely crowded. There was already a number of people waiting around for a spot in the bar area, and you literally had to wait behind the chairs of the seats you wanted. After about 30 minutes, we were finally able to sit down. Again, these were all really small plates and we all shared everything. I had the wagyu beef tartare which was literally out of this world. I've always loved anything tartare, combine it with shitake mushrooms and i was in heaven.I also tried the braised beef tongue, which i wasn't too excited about. I feel like i would of loved it if i didn't know what it was, but because i knew it was tongue i kind of kept imagining a tongue while i was eating it and it just sort of made me feel queasy.The Sugo was pretty amazing. I think my favorite thing about this restaurant is just all of the ingredients and the little things that make their dishes so unique. What is a gooseberry? I've literally never even heard of it before, but I can't imagine a better berry to go with these noodles. The pig face was also an interesting choice. I kind of though it would come out semi looking like a pigs face. Even though that sounds disgusting, it's kind of cool? I don't know, but it's only just the cheeks of the pig, so...it didn't resemble a face at all. I know I got a couple of other dishes, but i honestly can't remember what they are, but to be honest i don't think you can go wrong with anything. It's one of those places where I just want to try EVERYTHING!"
"Green beans are normally pretty darn good. Â The Girl and the Goat makes them crave-worthy. Â I would sign a lease with these green beans. Â And a plate of them is less than 10 bucks. Â I can't stop thinking about them at night.But of course they offer more than amazing veggies. Â Their hiramasa crudo (kind of a sushi-esque dish) had flavors I've never tasted before. Â And, since it was my boyfriends birthday, we got the apple bourbon dessert (at this point we were several beers in, which is why I can't remember the exact name of the dish). Â Whatever it was, it was unbelievable.The servers are phenomenal. Â I'm guessing their tips at the end of the night add to the smiles on their faces, but they are genuinely nice people who are able to advise you on food choices without seeming pushy.Next time I have some money to burn (and by burn I mean lightly sear and season), I will be back!"
"Girl & the Goat was one of our must eat at restaurant during our trip to Chicago. it was a Tuesday night and this place was packed, but I was able to bypass the wait and grabbed a seat at the lounge area. what was ordered: - the ham frites: i ordered these mainly because of the amount of reviews from yelp, but i was pretty disappointed. they're basically fries sprinkled with bits of ham. though the fries were cooked to perfection, they were super salty. (3 stars). - Pig Face: sooooo good, i want more! the meat melted in your mouth and it was seasoned perfectly. (5 stars)a plus to sitting in the lounge area is that you're able to talk with the people around you and get feedback on what they ate. if I'm ever back in Chicago, Girl & the Goat will totally be on our itinerary again."
"I had high expectations for this place for all the obvious reasons. That said, I was disappointed. When I come to a restaurant with all the hype and great reviews this place has, I expect a top-notch dining experience that matches the price tag. The food was good but not great, the service staff was overwhelmed due to the volume, and the ambiance was average. They do have a great wine list, though. Simply put, Chicago has WAY too many world-class dining options for me to return here."

"This was undoubtedly one of the best meals I have had in a long time. Our waiter Mark was instrumental in guiding us through what is an intimidating menu. As their options change daily, it is probably best to ask for some guidance. G&TG is small-plates dining at its best. We started with a challah bread with bleu cheese butter and tomato compote, it was very good. Next we had wood-fired oysters with bacon and an order of diver scallops with squash and pizza poofs. They decided to serve these together and it was a great combination. Next we had goat empanadas with feta cheese and a cauliflower dish with parmesan. The goat cheese empanadas were very good, but the cauliflower dish was disappointing. It was too salty and the use of pickles was a poor decision. Our last meal portion was a deep fried pork shank served with pita bread, butternut squash, and two sauces similar to buffalo and ranch dressings. This was amazing and definitely my favorite portion of the meal. We finished with a chocolate thai cake with pomegranate seeds and another dessert with a doughnut-like cake and apples. The desserts were phenomenal. This meal was fantastic and I know my girlfriend and I will be back!"
"Make your reservations early, because Girl and the Goat fills up FAST! Â My boyfriend made a reservation for us to go probably 3 months in advance, and we ended up going the night before Thanksgiving. It was worth the wait!As with many places these days, Girl and the Goat does smaller dishes that are meant to be shared. Â The menu is broken up into a veggie, fish and meat section and there are plenty of options for all dietary preferences.We had some sort of cauliflower and pickled vegetable dish, which was really delicious. Â I'm not usually a huge fan of pickled veggies, but this was great. Â I think we also had some sort of bread with various spreads appetizer, which was very goood.We had a very unfortunate incident with our scallops however. Â When they were delivered, both my boyfriend and I thought they smelled a bit off, but we thought it might have just been some of the burnt sauce or something. Â We ate the scallops and they tasted fine, but later that night we were both very sick. Â Given the quality of all the other food, I'm sure this was a one-off incident... it definitely wouldn't keep me from going back. Â But it's just a good lesson overall that if you think there's something ""off"" about your seafood - better to ask the wait staff and send it back.The wine menu was also very impressive. Â We had a delicious Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc with our meal, which paired excellently with our seafood choices. Â The overall ambiance in the restaurant is great as well. Â Really cool wood interior has a somewhat cabin-like vibe, Â but very upscale.Great restaurant overall and I'd definitely go back."
"This restaurant has been on my ""to eat"" list since the day it opened. And I finally had dinner here. The restaurant is spacious, clean, dim and has a very comfortable ambiance. We came here with reservations and had to wait about 20 minutes for our table to clear up. We didn't mind as we were so eager to eat here.When we were seated, our waitress really wasn't around but we were patient because we work in the industry so we know how overwhelming it can be when it gets busy. Sooooo, our waitress comes and asks if we've ever been here. None of us have been and boy did she do an awesome job explaining the menu and tips on how to order and what to pair the meat dishes with. So don't be timid and ask questions because the servers at G&G are well informed about everything on the menu.There were four in our party so our waitress recommended us to order 8 plates.We ordered a perfect amount of food and everyone was satisfied with what was consumed. Out of all 8 dishes, I could eat the beet salad every day, along with the scallop dish and the pork shank.Next time I dine at G&G, I would love to try the one ginormous lamb dish that feeds an army of 10+."
"Loved it! Â Great atmosphere & great food. Â Loved the oysters and the dessert was super unique/interesting. Â We were really full after our meal, but loved dessert, so I'm glad we tried it. Â Also, there are a few ""off-menu"" items, so ask your waiter for help/suggestions. Â So hard to pick what to try. Â Definitely plan on returning to try some of the other dishes!"
"Everything was absolutely deliciousWe had the Oysters with bacon, Scallopsgreen beans (who knew green beans could be that good?), Roasted chicken, Goat belly, Chocolate bouchon for dessert with passion fruit sorbet and salted toffee. The wait was worth it, every bite was a moment of food heaven."
"I'm going to have to be honest with myself and update this rating to ""Yay, I'm a fan"". I have been to Girl and the Goat about 5 more times in the past year, and the food is always exciting and fun. It's still one of the pricier restaurants to go to for dinner, and it's a pain in the ass to get reservations, but I always end up raving about the food the next day to family and friends.The last time we were there, our party got a nice assortment of seafood and vegetable dishes, the standout being the octopus and the cauliflower- amazing! I did not try the tongue, but that also got rave reviews. The desserts are always super yummy and come in the cutest jars. Highly recommended to not skip dessert!"
"Amazing! Friends and I were extremely disappointed with Chicago's food up until this point (sorry, the pizza is not as good as NY style). This place definitely lives up to its reviews and hype. The chef has the best palette. Integrating flavors such as kimchi and Indian/Iranian with the naan bread. Recommendations: pig face, pork shank, goat empanadas, and the dessert was perfect (brownie and sticky rice, two separate desserts). This has to open in California!"
"This restaurant was simply delicious. I went with 3 girlfriends while in town for a girls weekend. Was a little skeptical it wouldn't live up to all the hype I had heard, but after making a reservation (three months in advance) to get in, we weren't disappointed. Favourite dishes were the scallops, calamari and the cauliflower - but really everything we had was amazing, fresh and full of flavour. Service was spot on too and we went with all of our servers recommendations."
"Had a great experience here. Â Tried several things, including the pig face, which were all delicious. Â Fantastic wine, and great service. Â Absolutely no complaints!"
"Must start off with saying how friendly the staff were Â EVERYONE was smiley and happy and nice. Â Tony the manager stopped by at the end of dinner to say hello and thank us for having dinner there. Â We were impressed with their top-notch service for sure.Here comes the food...For four adults, our server suggested we each order two dishes plus couple of startersGreen Beans - SO GOOOOD MUST HAVE! Â I am already craving for some!Raw Oyster - Creamy and fresh! YUMYUMGrilled Baby Octopus - very tender and flavorfulEsgartgo ravioli - Bleh (our least favorite)Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - Good, but probably won't get it again as it is very similar to breakfast sausage + egg + syrup, meat was really tender thoPork Ribs - Super tenderGoat Empanadas - Excellent. Â The goat meat is very similar to pulled pork (texture)Doughnuts - LOVE LOVE LOVE Chocolate Bouchon - way TOO rich for me...very very chocolateyAll the above plus two beer came out to be around $140 before tip. Â Dishes are small and meant for sharing so you can try a million things. Â Food is good with nice presentation but I think maybe it's a bit salty & saucy for my taste (others love everything). Â Atmosphere is great. Â Overall experience was delightful and would go back for more green beans and smiley faces again!FYI. Â We made our reservation on 12/14 for tonight's (2/7) 6pm dinner for four people. Â You HAVE to make reservation in ADVANCE if you want to have dinner at a decent time!"
"I am a fair person, so this is what I'm gonna say overall abt ""Girl and the goat"": delicious creative dishes(4.5 out of 5), pleasant service(4out of 5),but but but computer queue system is terrible(1out of ) and the pony-tailed female host has certain attitude towards waiting customers.(she must forget whats called service)We were there at 6:15ish. The host said it will be approximately 1hr 15 mins wait.After1 hr 20 mins, we asked ""so how many guests ahead of us"" they said ""2"",we counted down another 2 tables,unfortunately,2,3,4,5 or even more group of guests had been seated.W e still were standing by the door waiting hopeless....No one took care of us,gave us a small bites or something to drink.for the total 2 hrs waiting, we decided to figure out if there's something wrong with queue system or they attempted to ignore us. Their manager apologized to us about the slow table turnover, however,she tried to hide the fact that their computer queue system is messed up.She was nice,she offered us free drinks and a few snacks to eat before we got a table.After 2 hr 20mins of waiting, we got a table by the kitchen. In addition to 3 free-offered snack(chickpea/green bean/bread) and 2 drinks,we ordered another 5 dishes(oyster/cauliflower/ escargot ravioli/baby octopus/pork rib) and another 2 drinks.I have to say that everything there is tasty. They know how to make a zesty sauce and dressing very well,except octopus was a bit over-cooked.Out of 4 dessert offers,we chose chocolate bouchon . foie fluff . salted toffee . milk chocolate sorbet . gooseberry compote to go with black coffee.And I personally fav the cocktail called ""4 in the same"".When we walked out of restaurant, another male manager of restaurant ran out and unexpectedly apologized to us again about the unreasonable wait.It seriously surprised us.I mean at least they show they care about who give them business.This is a good example of reassuance.It was in general ""gourmet"" standard food.so ...if you are in Chicago, try it one time.BUT make sure to get there before 5pm, otherwise you would wait for a table forever....."
I can't add a ton to what has been written. I loved it.
"I often say this is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, which is saying a lot considering how many amazing restaurants we have to offer!I've been several times. My last two experiences at GATG however, I've had a hard time with the overwhelming butteriness of everything, including the veggies. I like to taste the veggies and not be overpowered by fat. Not sure if I've been ordering wrong or if things have changed, but I've got to drop it down a star for that.Overall, still a great experience and very tasty, fresh food."
"Months in advance, I made the reservation. This is nothing unheard of, I'm sure. But I almost completely forgot about the reservation, but thanks to the miracles of emailing, I remembered. Phew. Anyways, for a Thursday night 8pm reservation, we still had to wait a good twenty minutes. That's not a big deal to me, but I'm sure some people in our small world would blow a haystack over that. Regardless, we got seated, and ordered off the fine drink list. It's a bit pricey, but I expected nothing less. For the appetizer, I believe we had the peppers, which were absolutely delicious, albeit with a pleasant spice on my tongue for the rest of the dinner. The chickpea fritters were tasty, but I wish they gave us a bit more. Also, the scallops were basically butter from the sea. I forgot what they put on them, but they basically melted in my mouth. Overall, whilst an expensive (and long planned out) dinner, I would recommend the place to anyone who enjoys the Chicago dining ""scene."" It's one of those ""most-go"" places, so you might as well check it off your list. Just be sure to do so months in advance."
Best meal of my life! The food was amazing but the service was outstanding. Â I was with a large group and the group ahead of us was taking a very long time to finish. The guy at the head the restaurant apologized multiple times and wound up asking the group to leave. The waiter was also extremely funny and helpful. Can't wait to go back!!!
"Absolutely amazing meal, very attentive and friendly staff, and an overall great experience. Can't wait to go back!"
"I don't get this place. Â The food is creative and interesing; service great. Â But it is beyond doubt one of the noisiest restaurants (if not THE noisiest) I have ever visited in my life -- I had to lean across the table and SCREAM at my dinner companion just to be heard. Â I don't understand the attraction to screaming across a table. Â I asked that the music be turned down (since there was no point to it -- there are no sound-absorbing materials in the entire restaurant, so every sound reverberates and echoes, creating a resounding din)....but the manager said he turned it down with absolutely no difference. Â So on top of a restaurant full of screaming people, there was the bass beat and shrill treble coming through. Â I wound up paying about $75 a person for this experience -- I'll never go back. Â Which is a shame, because the food was interesting -- if overpriced. Â I appreciated the staff and the effort put into the creation of the place, but the experience was not worth it. Â However, based on the throng of people there, my opinion is in the vast minority. Â I would love for Chicago restaurants to have decibel meters to register what you're walking into -- so that people who do not like screaming can look at a review and gauge whether or not it is worthwhile. Â This restaurant would rate a heavy metal rock concert level, I think. Â  Unbelievable."
"Out of this world!!! Â I waited 4 months to get in, and it was worth every minute. Â  The food is outstanding, prices are reasonable, service excellent, and the atmosphere can be either be hip or romantic depending on your situation. Â The only way this place could be better is if it was BYOB, but their drink menu is superb."
"...and the hype is true. Ambience: elegant, dark wood, high ceilings without being pretentiousService: servers knowledgable about the menu, water glass always full, great wine recsFood: the menu is extensive-lots of meats but still with veggies, cheeses, and fresh baked breads. (one in my group was a vegetarian and enjoyed the meal fully.) the SHRIMP and RAVIOLI were amazing and we also enjoyed chickpea fritters, loompa , seared scallops, skirt steak - all fabulous. the goat pizza wasn't much to write home about. we went with the fried doughnuts dessert and it was worth every caloriePrice: $4 breads to $13 small plates, overall reasonably priced for the quality/quantity of foodAdded bonus: Stephanie is usually on the floor and is very nice. Doesn't mind fan interruptions! :)"
"An earthy, communal meal with a focus on flavor. My group and I shared over ten plates so I'd like to summarize a few 'stand outs'. Also, I'd definitely recommend ordering bread and grilled oysters! hen of the woods mushroom raout - the sweet potato agnolotti pasta was from scratch and enhanced by the creamy mushrooms.crispy duck tongues - surprisingly refreshing. it was balanced masterfully with acid, herb, fat, etc.sugo - pappardelle, rosemary, cape gooseberries - medley of braised meats with fresh pasta and squirt of gooseberry...tasty!gingerbread cake with gelato - best dessert of the bunch. the ginger popped from the moist cake"
"Literally, the BEST dish I've ever had in my life...and I wasn't even hungry.I ordered the scallop dish (not the bay scallops, the regular ones) which currently isnt on the menu. Â Let me tell you...it was phoenomenal. Â The brussel sprouts were perfectly fried and the scallops seared to deliciousness. Â Service was great and you can walk in without a reservation and sit at the bar to eat."
2nd time going here and words cannot describe how fantastic the food is. Â Went with a group of 4 and had a blast. Â The goat neck off menu is to die for along with the goat liver mousse. Â Highly recommend this place even though it takes a good 3 months to get a good time on open table. Â Some of the best service I have ever had.
"Every single dish was outstanding! WOW food!Yes it's an incredibly busy place so either make your reservations well in advance or get there early, opens at 4:30 pm and sit at the bar where they have full service. Even at 4:30 pm somehow 90% of the bar was full but most where waiting for their table.We put our name in , at 4:30 pm, and around 5pm we could of sat down at a table which had a reservation at 6:15 pm or stay at the bar which we did and had great service!The decor is dark but has floor to ceiling windows in the front that brings in a lot of light. The focal wall in the center of the room is charred wood, black!The color pallet is gray/black/ metal, all very cool.Go an enjoy!"
"Over hyped. Not anything special. Service was pretty shitty. Tried to charge me for a bottle of wine when I got a glass, if I said nothin they would have done nothing. Also, the waiter seemed disappointed that I caught it. Not that I'm saying any shady stuff was goin down, but who knows. Atmosphere was lively and nice, space was cool, but our table was shoulder to shoulder with the other table next to us, which i absolutely despise. This forces you into conversation with whoever is sitting next to you, simply because, THEY CAN HEAR EVERYTHING YOU SAY!. Agh, so annoying. I am not anti social, I just do not want to talk to you. Food was not good, and the portions were so small you have to order at least $100 worth of food to get full. I got:Goat Empenadas: These were a special item, they were good, but nothing really blew me away about them. Hawaiian Sunfish: Bland, really. Nice texture though, but a strike out overall on flavor for me. Capers made it worse. Escargot ravioli: Terrible, this was just awful. None of the flavors went well together, seemed like the chef's were like ""Lets see if we can get away with this one."" Pork Ribs: Sucked, I thought this would be the saving grace, but it was on par with everything else, bland and misguided. The meat was tough and overcooked. And $18 for 4 ribs? Fuck that. Sweet potato Mushroom Creme Fraiche: Really good. Pork fat donuts: Finally, I thought. Something I had at longman and eagle, so this will be good. Wrong. They tasted stale, like they had been there for 2 days at least. Goat cheese whatever dessert: This was really good. Drinks:Aviation: Tasty! Liked this a lot. Double Barrel Manhattan: Awful! Tasted like straight up whiskey. And two shriveled ass cherries in a martini glass did not a Manhattan make. House wine: God awful, tasted like a cheap merlot. Hated it. We were going to order the Chickpea fritters, but our server said, and I quote, ""That is the weaskest thing on the menu."" Really? The weakest thing? That is a terrible way to speak about a fancy restaurant that charges $18 for 4 ribs. Also, it kind of felt like a slam to my date. A little pissed about that. Left pretty messed up. Felt a bit like I just got my pants pulled down at my grandmothers funeral. Which is not a nice feeling. If I am going to drop over $200 on dinner, I am going back to Blackbird or Schwa.Side note: manager messaged me on here & said can I have your number to discuss? Gave it up, no response, so now it is at 1 star."
All I can is WOW! That was awsome
"FINALLY MADE IT. Â LOVED IT. Â Mainly got veggie dishes b/c I was with my wife, so try the roasted cauliflower w/ banana peppers, chickpea fritters were good and though I hate mushrooms my wife LOVED the hen of the woods mushroom ragout. Â For the non-veg, get the Pig Face... it's not really a pig's face but it's SOOOOO GOOOD. I'll be back with some carnivores to conquer some other dishes. Â It's a small place so definitely try and get a reservation, or get there early to try and get a spot."
"The food is obviously amaze but I wasn't expecting such fantastic customer service! Typically at restaurants like this the staff is snooty and pretentious - not so at G&G! I made a reservation 3 months ago and was so excited to finally try it! Â On the night of my reservation, snow took over Chicago and I was about 45 minutes late due to traffic. I was panicked and so upset thinking that such a popular restaurant would be angry and tell me I'd have to make another reservation 3 months later. Upon arrival, I apologized profusely and the host insisted not to worry and seated us right away. I was shocked. On my way back from the restroom I apologized again and thanked him for being so kind and understanding. Again, he insisted that it was okay and told me to relax and enjoy my evening. I was so impressed by his graciousness and will definitely be back for the great food and oustanding customer service! Thanks G&G!"
Awesome food. Unreal drinks. Great environment! I love the Girl and the Goat so much. The Tempest is the best cocktail. The spice and mixture is unreal. Best cocktail I have ever had there. Sometimes I go there just for that drink. Anyone that lives or travels to Chicago must go here.
"Another great restaurant in Chicago!We didn't have a reservation, so our wait was about 1.5 hours. We spent some time at the bar having delicious cocktails and actually got seated after only 1 hour.We had..-Radish Salad (probably my favorite dish of the whole meal)-Beef tongue (really flavorful - tastes just like beef only more chewy)-Octopus (my least favorite - the flavor of all the ingredients was over shadowed by the over cooked burnt taste of evereything. Clearly it was on the grill too long)-Bread w/ peanut butter butter and honeycomb (surprisingly AMAZING and well worth the price. We finished the whole bread and I started eating the honey out fo the pot it was so good - second favorite thing)-Blood orange sorbet with pecan pie for dessert - interesting mix of spices and orange, but really small.Interior is also incredibly well designed, and I saw valet out front but we stole free parking a couple blocks up and walked in)"
"Excellent atmosphere, a bit noisy for a date, great for 4+ group. Best dish was tempura lup de mer. Will come again. Decently priced wine list."
I rarely give 5 stars but this place in everything that it was hyped up to be. Every dish we tried I just wanted more of. Service was friendly and very prompt. I have paid more for meals but think this place is almost under priced for the quality of food that you are given
"Ham frites - The alpha and omega of a great dining experience. Goat empanadas as well. Well done, Chef Izard, well done."
"Let me start off by saying that we are not true foodies; although, we do love food and love to eat. Â What I mean is that my husband would likely never make reservations one month (plus) in advance to eat anywhere nor would he ever want to stand in line to dine. Â We really wanted to try GATG and just decided we would wait until the hype died down (when will that be exactly?). Â This restaurant definitely deserves some hype because the food is great but I do feel like the atmosphere is filled with approx 80% of diners who want to be there only because of the hype and less because of the food.We got lucky when a friend had 7pm weeknight reservations that she was giving away. Â We snagged those up, asked some friends for entree suggestions and set out for dining bliss. I went with 4 stars to balance a 5 star review for food and 3 star review for pricing and portion size. Â We each ordered a cocktail and approx 5 items from the menu plus a dessert. Â I have to start with the dessert because it was amazing. Â Made up for any minor issues with had with portion size and pricing and really helped bring the night together. Â It was a super dense choc cake with peanut fluff (is there anything better) and then gelato from black dog (my fav)!!!! Â Best dessert ever!!!Our cocktails were fab but the prices seemed $1-2 more than they needed to be (each). Â We expected this would be the case and didn't mind shelling out the cash in the end because the taste and freshness of the drinks was spot on. Our entrees were all very good except maybe the beef ribs. Â I thought it was too many bones and not enough meat or sweet potatoes. Â We had the sugo which is a pasta dish that a friend recommended. Â It was our favorite item. Â We also tried a few different veggies which were all really good ... and that is where my issue with pricing and portion size comes in. Â I was surprised that a $9-$12 dish of veggies provided less than a full cup serving. I know the produce is local but I still feel that was at least a 70% markup on the veggies dishes. Â And coming back to my comment earlier about atmosphere - there seemed to be too many people who didn't mind dishing out that kind of money on veggies on a weekly basis (so maybe the hype will never end). Overall, great taste but I do think my husband was hungry when we left (although he would not say). Â I would love to go back - maybe for a group occasion like a birthday or celebration but I will likely not be making reservations for my husband and I to dine one month in advance. I am really happy to see all the success that Stephanie Izard has with her first restaurant - congrats to her!!!"
Fresh food that is cooked very well. Â Definitely need to be open to new tastes before coming here.
"I've been 3 times in the last year. Â I can't say enough good about this place. Â The food is always to die for, the service is always great, and I always leave wanting to explode because I ate far too much but couldn't stop myself because everything is always so good.The beer pairings are excellent. Â If you can get in, go! Â I really don't have anything bad to say about this place other than that it can get a little loud, but I really don't care because once the food is on the table me and my friends shut up and maybe sputter out 'soooo good' every now and then.All the hype about this place is completely true!"
"We had a great meal Saturday night. Â We had 6 plates and dessert and ALL of it was outstanding and really interesting. The skate, gratin potatoes and goat loin were highlights. Â The gratin potatoes are seriously amazing and something I would never, ever order out but really glad I didn't miss them. Â Be adventurous, this is the place to try new things.I can't say enough about the service. Â Even though it was really crowded our reservation was on time. Â They are pros at dealing with crowds and even the hostess took some time to explain some of the menu. Our waiter Mark was extremely knowledgeable and had some great suggestions. The timing of each dish was nicely spaced out and it never felt rushed. When we had a question about a beer on the menu, a woman came over within minutes to talk with us about the menu and make suggestions. The whole experience made for a really great night out."
"I made reservations about 45days out for a Monday night at 7:45 for my 28th birthday. It was pretty good, but not great. With that kind of wait and price, I probably won't be back.We did have a great waitress, Taylor. She told me happy birthday, even.They didn't have a great cocktail selection- but they did have a good beer selection. Not many on draft, but good quality craft beers that go well with food, so A on that.It was the 3 of us: so Taylor recommended ordering 6-8 small plates. We ordered 7 plates total- two things from the veggies section: the chickpea fritter which was ok as well as the roasted cauliflower, which was a standout of the night. We ordered two items from the fish section: the grilled baby octopus which was great, and the steamed mussels which were ok but HUGE.....so big they made them hard to eat. Finally we ordered three items from the meat section: the ham frites, which were good, as well as the goat sausage flat bread which was another stand out. However, we decided to get the Walt's chicken, which at $23 for a small plate was the priciest dish on the menu....and it was definitely the worst. Totally disappointing. Dry, small...not a fan.We were looking over the dessert menu and couldn't decide between the pear wontons, the chocolate or the malasadas. I asked Taylor and she just said ""get all 3 because you are getting one free for your birthday!"" and walked away. Ok, thanks for the free dessert, but I was pretty stuffed and only wanted to split two. Plus, I also wanted to order coffee---so I had to track her down after she left to put that in. At least they were all delicious and actually, one of the highlights of the evening. The space had an interesting decor- using burnt wood and featuring an open kitchen. It was visually appealing, but a little loud. My companions weren't so thrilled they left smelling of smoke, either.Total check was $210 for 3 people (7 plates, 3 desserts, 7 beers and a coffee)."
"Perfection from start to finish -- and I don't give these props out like Halloween candy. Â Girl & the Goat is perhaps the finest restaurant I've ever had the pleasure of dining at.STARTERS: The Brioche with lemon butter. Â So good you could cry.THE MAIN EVENT: Â I went in with the idea of, ""show me what you've got"" and this plan is the way to go. Â We basically said, we've never eaten here before, just bring us what you think we'd love. Â Do this. Â They don't get anything wrong.THE COCKTAILS: Â No matter what libation -- and I tried many -- they were liquid parties in my mouth. Â Scrumptious.One after the other, the dishes came, each one better than the next....a foodies dream come true.THE SERVICE: Â 5 stars. Â Tony, our waiter, anticipated our every need before we even thought of it. Â In fact, every single staff member was on their A-game, as if they had invited us to their home for dinner. Pride, friendliness, knowledge of their craft. You simply couldn't ask for anything more.BOTTOM LINE: Â This is THE place to take that special someone if you're looking for the prefect evening of luxurious yet totally unpretentious cuisine. Â Bravo X 10.I CAN'T WAIT TO RETURN.Many thanks.Photos and ""Girl & The Goat SautÃ©ed Green Bean Recipe"" here:simply-showbiz.com/blog/â¦"
"Awesome experience. Â Second time having dinner and keeps getting better. Â Our server was marnie and she was the best! Â I even lost my credit card under the bar and she grabbed a flashlight and found it for me! Â It's so refreshing to find a restaurant with amazing food, and truly genuine and great service. Â You can tell the staff really appreciates working there and has true passion for food and connecting with guests. Â Girl and the goat remains my favorite restaurant in Chicago hands down..."
"I've given this one a lot of thought. I followed Stephanie Izard through her time on Top Chef and eagerly awaited the opening of her first restaurant here in Chicago, knowing that expectations would be impossibly high. The 2-month span between booking a reservation and actually getting a table doesn't help this.We arrived a little bit early so decided to grab a drink at the bar...which, much like the restaurant, is packed, even on a Tuesday in winter. The drinks were pricey but very creative and absolutely delicious. Didn't even mind that we were seated a few minutes late; I've waited 2 months, what's another 10 minutes?I wish I could say that the food continued this trend and surpassed all my ridiculous expectations. It's not that Girl & the Goat isn't a good restaurant with very good food...it is. The problem is that there are virtually no lighter options on the small-plates-style menu...the heavy, fatty, oily dishes just keep on coming. We made an effort to break up our ordering between all three sections of the menu (fish, vegetable, meat), but even this didn't seem to help. Case in point, the hiramasa crudo, a dish ostensibly starring the beautiful, delicate fish served raw is overpowered by the plate's secondary elements (a heavy aioli and fried pork belly). Taken alone, and broken up by something a bit lighter, I would have absolutely adored everything on the menu. But as it was, I left feeling a bit queasy and already planning a long, hard workout for the next morning.There is still plenty to like at G&tG (very cool design including a wide open kitchen, super creative drink list, great service, and the small plates dining concept overall). I even accept that some of the blame is likely due to user error in ordering. In all likelihood I'll be back. Just know what you're getting and order accordingly."
"Girl was definitely one of the most memorable dining experiences of my life. Â We had reservations, but still had to wait quite a while to be seated. When all was said and done, though, I would have waited ten times as long. Â The food was simply brilliant, the service was amazing and the space is gorgeous. Â What more could you want (other than for it to be easier to actually get a table at this place)?Get the pig face. Â You won't regret it."
"I wanted to give a three star, but considering I just had a delicious and creative meal at the Grove in Grand Rapids, it might be unfair to judge this place with the similar ""farm to table"" concept right after. I feel everything grilled came with a hint of charred bitterness, and it overpowers the original flavor of the ingredients a bit too much. Food is quite salty, so had to order bread to go with everything. Overall I would have appreciated to taste the flavor of the original ingredients especially when they have fresh ones straight from local farms."
I have been here 3 times in the last 4 months and can say everything on the menu has been incredible. My co-worker is gluten free and due to the sharing style I was too and can attest it was better than any food I have had with gluten in recent memory. Â The menu rotates regularly but we have yet to miss on any front and have ordered probably 10-12 different items.
"I went to this restaurant about a month ago and all I can say is that I am upset I hadn't gone sooner! We tried to make a reservation, but that was not happening so we thought we would go and wait for a seat at the bar. When we arrived there was a 2.5 hour wait to be seated we put our name down just in case something opened up sooner. When we got to the bar we ordered a bottle of white wine and the bartender kept the bottle on ice for us- which was great because there was no where we could have kept the bottle on our own. There were 2 guys that were leaving about 15 minutes after we arrived so my friend and I were able to sit down right away. So much for 2.5 hour wait! The guy bartender was awesome and suggested great things. He even brought us out the green beans which we didn't order but he thought our meal wouldn't be complete with out them....he was RIGHT! It was the most savory salty yet sweet thing I had ever had. We order a dessert that had goat milk beer poured over it and thai peanut ice cream....It was HEAVEN.Will be well worth the wait if you choose to go...I am planning my next trip back already :)"
"Two words...GREEN BEANS!!!!!Also had the pork face, goat empanadas, and octopus. Â They were all pretty good, but I would order other things next time. Â The green beans on the other hand were the best thing we ate in Chicago over an entire trip dedicated to food."
Make reservations and you will be seated upon walking in the door. Girl & The Goat has mastered the art of dining out. The food comes to you as they best recommend. The mixologists can make just about any drink with their own G and G spin. Loved the green beans and hope to come back here for many years to come!
"Loved the food, ambiance, service, cocktails!"
"Once again, the hype strikes! Ahhh, so looking forward to Girl & the Goat and it was a bit of a letdown. The fact is, G&TG is doing nothing really new or inventive and is simply dressing up certain dishes that don't need to be dressed up. The food is tasty but not mind blowing. It's nothing I've really not had before - perhaps done with a bit of a twist, but when you are paying the higher prices you are asked to pay for these small plates you better leave satisfied and wanting to come back. We left full but not wanting more. We even skipped desert. Perhaps the meal would have been more enjoyable if it hadn't been for the two douche bags sitting next to us yapping about dumb sh*t like two frat boys.My wife and I came here for her birthday dinner - I made reservations 3 months in advance just to get in. I looked over the reviews and the menu several times and got excited. This was hard for me because I hated Â hard when I first heard it was opening up: celeb chef, small plates, open kitchen, pretty much like what everyone else is doing these days. Â But, I put this all aside because I love to eat and try new places and I think I've become some sort of foodie, but not a food snob. I'll still go to McDonald's for breakfast.So, we got there an hour early in hopes to sit before our reservation at 8:45. We gladly went to the bar and ordered a couple cocktails and then found two spots at the bar. My wife ordered the grape and grain and I ordered the over under. I can't recall what was in the cocktails - I did not enjoy mine at all (too much gin) but my wife really enjoyed hers.The decor and layout was nice but whole place was almost like a big bar. I liked the wood paneling and the open kitchen and I expected it to be loud. It was just hard to have a convo at the table. I guess we're getting tired of the layout of communal tables or on top of each other two tops. Â You are forced into everyone's convos next to you, hence the douche bag reference above.When we sat down we ordered two things as we were starving and knew we wouldn't sit down until our reservation. We started with four raw fanny bay oysters with radish mignonette and tarragon. These were excellent oysters and wish we got a couple more for $12 but I know the standard oyster pricing. Â We also ordered one of the breads with chicken liver butter and carrot sage oil. The spreads were pretty good and so was the warm bread. Nothing mind blowing but for $4 it was a good deal.I ordered another drink, this time an Emmet's from Palatine, IL (who knew beer was brewed out there?) while my wife finished my cocktail. Â The beer was pretty good but I bemoaned the draft beer selection. Â There was a lot of beer and most of it I've seen before at restaurants. Â After going to Maria's Packaged Goods I've noticed other fantastic beers I never see at top restaurants like Three Floyd's Zombie Dust. When I asked what the seasonal beer was I was told Robert the Bruce. Really? That's the seasonal Three Floyd's I'm paying an extra $2 for because of the restaurant and location? I'll try something different. Â Maybe I'm a beer snob...wait, no I'm not I just want to see unique beer lists.After waiting 10 mins after our reservation we finally sat down. I would have appreciated the hostess coming over to us that they were a few minutes behind but not a big deal. Â Our server was very nice and helpful (she also spaced out the plates well with a small break in between) and we dove in with a couple drinks (I got the Avery white from Colorado) and my wife got a glass of wine. Both were very good. Â We then ordered some of the often mentioned items: chickpea fritters, goat carpaccio, escargot ravioli and the famous pig face.The chickepea fritters were really excellent. This was a more complex dish in terms of flavors with two large fritters with eggplant-tomatillo caponata & mozzarella. The ravioli was fine but not mind-blowing. It was basic and had mild taste but it didn't wow me.However, we can't say the same thing for the carpaccio and even the pig face. Both were tasty but covered in fried onions. Why? Â It's dressing up a dish that didn't need it. Sometimes, you just want to taste the base of the dish without anything else. The carpaccio was fine but the onions took away from whatever we tried to taste in the raw goat meat. When you order this dish you do so cuz it's raw and you want to taste the meat. Not so here. The goat even had some vinaigrette that was fine but taste-diverting.Same thing for the pig face. We just wanted to taste the FACE! We didn't' need all these fried onions. The egg and the face would have been enough to really see how good the meat was. The dish was fine but it was just face meat put into two patties with an over easy egg. To be innovative we were hoping to actually get a part of a pig face. I wanted to see ears or a nose! LOL.All in all we'd come back for a trip to the bar for a drink and a couple plates but we're not rushing to come back."
"It's ridiculously hard to get a reservation here, but once you eat here you'll understand why!Brought my girlfriend here on our first date a few months ago. Â Since it was too late to get a reservation, we decided to take the risk and do a walk-in at 4PM. Â Once there, we were promptly seated along with quite a few other tables. Â The communal seating here is off-putting to some, but we both really liked how the tables were big enough that you still had a good feeling of intimacy with your date but you could easily peak over and see what everyone else at the table is enjoying as well. Â The food is farm fresh, creative, and full of flavor. Â Definitely go for the Pig Face, you won't be disappointed, it's one of the few items along with the Ham Frites that is a constant on their ever evolving menu. Â We shared 8 dishes between the two of us and wished we could be rolled out onto the street after dinner. Â The kitchen does Â a great job of looking at your ticket and bringing out the dishes in order of light to heavy so that your palette stays fresh and you can fully enjoy each dish. Â This place has it all and then some. Â It's best if you can snag a reservation but if you can't, then try something new and have an early dinner...it helps that there are a ton of other places around there where you can drink and have dessert as well."
"First, I'm excited that this place has over 1000 reviews. Second, I'm sad that my review will probably never get read as it sifts to the bottom of this sea of yelpers. Â Definitely good for business!Currently, this is mine and my ladyfriend's favorite restaurant in Chicago, BY FAR. Â We've been twice and both times were amazing. Â Sure, having to make a reservation two months in advance is a little annoying, but come on, even Christmas comes only once a year. Yes, I just compared the eating experience of Girl & the Goat to Christmas. Â Which is sort of true, because when you make the reservation, you really have no clue what the menu will be like by the time you get to eat (anyone like opening presents? I do). Â The restaurant decor and atmosphere is sort of dark, both literally and metaphorically. Â The paintings on the wall are outstanding and are a little like Alice in Wonderland meets Tim Burton. Â The waitstaff both times have been very knowledgable about the menu and attentive to the point of us asking if they should be paying attention to other diners. Now to the food. Seriously, if everything I mentioned before was terrible, I think the food would make up for it. Â I'll only point out our favorite dishes, since we've probably had about 15 total due to our group sizes. Â And anyway, the menu changes so they may not be on there anymore. Â **I should also mention that each dish will accomodate about 4 or 5 people and each person should pick 2 or 3 dishes. Â The size isn't too big for couples, and honestly if you get to go with only one other person, you're lucky that you get to eat so much of each dish!** Roasted cauliflower - Never thought I'd like it so much. This is one of two dishes we've ordered both times. The pine nuts compliment it greatlyRaw Oysters - I know it's probably not for everyone, but if you want to try raw oysters in Chicago without going to some place really fancy, they do a great job.Goat Belly- can't quite remember how it was thrown together, but very deliciousPig Face - has a sunny side up egg with it and the meat was so tender I didn't even need to chew. Â Sounds kind of gross, but damn was it good.We enjoyed every thing there and honestly it may seem a little expensive, but for the quality of food you are getting and being in Chicago, the cost is of no concern. Â HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"
"Flavors cover up the main ingredient, be it pork, beef or seafood, instead of enhancing it. Overly hyped place. We are not impressed."
"Great! Â It's kinda like a tapas place, but very very good. The place is super busy. Â I was lucky to get a table without a reservation! Â I came and waited for about an hour, and they snuck me and my party in between two reservations. Â Before seating us, I was asked if we could finish before the next reservation (about 1.5 hours).It was well worth the wait!"
"I avoided eating at G&TG for over a year as I belived it was over hyped and so many of the great reviews were attributable to Stephanie Izard being such a nice person. Trying to get a reservation was a complete pain as well and frankly, I didn't think it would be worth the effort.My wife and I managed to grab the last 2 seats at the bar at 4.30 and the restaurant was already 80% full. There were 15 chefs behind the line and the bartenders were already slinging out cocktails like most bars do in River North when they are packed. This is a restaurant that is used to doing high volume at a high level and the service throughout the meal was second to none.The pig in a blanket bread was a great start. Very tasty and a great way to take the edge off your hunger if you are starved like I was when we first arrived 5/5Roasted Cauliflower was excellant. Didnt like the mint on top of it but a simple dish executed perfectly.Beef Tongue was interesting but not the strongest dish we had over the evening. 4/5Hiramasa Crudo was best dish of the night. the pork belly was as good as I have ever tasted 5/5Scallops with Duck - again a fantastic dish. If you go to G&TG order this dish 5/5The drinks, the service, the food, the ambiance was all of a very high level. I'll go back again to Girl and the Goat, whenever I can get a reservation !!!!!!"
"I was in Chicago with fellow Yelper Carleen P. and we had hit that stage of the vacation where travelling was wearing a bit thin. Might have had something to do with the previous night's cocktails but I digress. Â After a not so fun morning, we were determined to make the best of the day and have a swank dinner. We could not have been happier when Yelp led us to G&G, who's chef's celebrity status was lost on us but the food looked amazing. We looked at the menus, drooled at the pictures, and wondered if we'd be lucky enough to get seated. 3 month wait list on reservations, oh no! Â We arrived before opening (4:30pm) and there was already a line (not looking good). Undetered, we marched in and spoke to the gracious host staff and pleaded our case: ""Please oh please, we may look scrubby but we've had a bad day and we'd ever so much like to spend gobs of money on delicious food & wine. We're famished and will eat fast, promise!"" Seats at the communal dining table was no problem at all and we were seated promptly. Â The communal table is a large, raw hewn rustic table with room for 8-10 (maybe more?) just off the line on the open kitchen. This is likely the most hectic spot in the restaurant to dine but exciting. In general, the atmosphere is upscale but understated with large open windows, candlelight, glass, stone, and vaulted ceilings. Fancy enough to dress up but laidback enough that we didn't feel uncomfortable in jeans & track jackets. Â We started off with cocktails, I tried the Agave Fleur which had a nice kick of tequila that was subdued perfectly by the St. Germain. Carleen had the Best of Three - a nice combo of Pimms, Vodka, and cucumber; also delish. Â Our super awesome server (whose name I forget, bad, bad Ellen), gave us the lay of the land on how the menu and timing of dishes works. Better to order everything at once and your server will time the delivery of your dishes to maximize the experience. Â We started out with the Kohlrabi Salad (with fennel & blueberries) and I don't think I can say enough about how good this salad was. Carleen and I huddled in our corner, trying not to look like lunatics as we shoved this awesomeness into our mouths.  Â I also got the Goat Liver Pate which was served with fresh baked hand formed crumpets and the perfect pickle and jam accompaniments. The pate was creamy, smooth, and perfectly flavored, as rich as foie gras. Â We also tried the Ham Frites - what are Ham Frites, you might ask? These are seriously the best fries ever, cooked in pig fat, and seasoned to perfection, they put all other fries to shame.  And then Pig Face arrived. The weirdest, most delicious experience my tastebuds have ever been on. If you eat here and you eat pork, you absolutely must get the Pig Face. It is melt in your mouth fantastic. Â At that point we could hardly contain ourselves as the endorphin rush of an outstanding meal (and maybe the bottle of champagne) had us gushing over the food with our companions at the table. Inhibitions were out the window and in a minute or two flat, everyone at the table is passing plates around, insisting ""YOU MUST TRY THIS!""  Â Thank you G&G, we are now total fangirls with head chef Stephanie Izard's cookbook in hand, t-shirts on order, and the best possible memories of dining at this restaurant."
"uhh Amazing!!My favorite restaurant when i came to visit Chicago. I tried to make a reservation 2 weeks prior but it was all booked aside from an 11:45 pm reservation which left us no time to go out after. We decided to take our chances and walk in and try for a seat at the bar. We ended up only waiting about 15 minutes.. score!!Chickpea Fritters: MUST HAVE! -- favorite!Scallops: Â Eh...good but not amazingEscargo ravioli: different, good!Pigs face: Yummy!!!! 2nd favorite!Forgot what dessert we ordered but it was just as awesome as the food.Please try this restaurant if you are ever in chiacgo! Its a must!"
"This is the most frustrating review I have written on here...I wanted G&TG to be amazing...my GF and I waited a month for our reservation..We get there for our 8:45 spot and we get sat crammed in between 2 other tables yacking to each other...it was not quite the date night we had in mind.....oh well we can deal if the food is great!!So we order drinks, she gets wine and I get this double barrel something...get this drink and it was terrible..I could barely drink it. I sent it back and just ordered wine, the thing was so un-liquory..So we order food..ScallopsMusselsBeef RibsWhen I say TINY I mean TINYYYY portions...$13-15 each and their were 2 scallops and maybe 8 mussels. Even smaller was the Beef Rib Tips...SO small...maybe 6 bites.Needless to say I left with $95 less cashola and still very hungry...So sad because we were wanting it to blow our minds...We will be back maybe but I will make sure to switch up the meals we order."
"what can i add?it was everything i expected and more. keep your eye on opentable, i got my reservation the day of because there was a random 2-top open.don't order the mushroom ragout unless you REALLY love mushrooms, i don't and realized it just wasn't for my palate.i do love onions, and i could eat a loaf of the onion brioche everyday for the rest of my life."
Worth the hype - the food is amazing!
"From what I've heard it's pretty hard to get a reservation, especially on short notice. Out of the blue I thought I'd look to see how far in advance they were booked and there just so happened to be one available that night so I took it.Our reservations were pretty early and it was already getting crowded by the time we arrived, but surprisingly our table was ready for us to be seated immediately. We ordered the:Pretzel Bread Roasted CauliflowerChickpeas FrittersSeared Scallops,Duck Confit RavioliAs others have mentioned, everything tasted a bit salty, but I actually don't mind that. I was pleasantly surprised by some of the flavor combinations. The mint and peppers in the Roasted Cauliflower dish is one that comes to mind.We were there for just over an hour, but there was only two of us so we didn't linger longer than need be. We probably should have ordered one less dish or just skipped the bread, but it was all so good. Next time we would probably bring friends."
"I've been to Girl & the Goat 3 times since they've opened and this last dining experience was absolutely top notch. Â I took my hubby here for his birthday dinner and we had pretty much starved ourselves all day to big out on their delicious eats.A few of my favorites are as follows:- sauteed green beans in fish sauce (a must!) - the green beans are fresh, cooked perfectly and smothered in a scrumptious creamy fish sauce- escargot raviolis - holy sh*t...who knew snails could be so delicious, packed perfectly in these little pasta pockets- braised beef cheeks - everyone says to get the pig face, but I've had it and to me tasted like a jimmy dean breakfast sausage...the beef cheeks are where it's at!- halibut - can't remember too many details about the flavoring but I remember that it was fantastic...with so many dishes, things tend to get lost but this is def worth a try.- goat loin - I've never really tried goat (except for the goat chili at Little Goat diner) and I have to say this was probably the best dish we ate all night. Â It was served with blackberries and I normally don't like fruit with my meat but these flavors went together so effortlessly that my tastebuds were thanking me for being adventurous and ordering this dishWe had several drinks/glasses of wine and dessert and the bill came to about $160. Â Our server rocked! Â She brought us over a complimentary appetizer and dessert for my hubby's birthday. Â Girl & the Goat continues to be one of the most top notch dining experiences in Chicago."
There is nothing else that can be said about the food - it is obviously excellent.I wanted to let people know that the overall experience was amazing too. Our waitress really helped to give us a great experience and pick food that we were interested in and would all go well together. The rest of the staff was great too.
"G&TG is one of the very few restaurants that I loved every single dish that I ordered. Â It's pretty much a restaurant that ANYTHING is freaken good like Animal & Cleo in LA.No reservations because it was all booked up. Â My bf and I strategically came in at 9:30 pm when the dinner rush hour would subside a little. Â We only had to wait about 45 min for our table and that time flew when we were having drinks at the bar.FoodConfit goat belly - 5 ratingMmMmmmmmm. Â It was combined with pieces of Alaskan crab chunks. Â Initially, it is soft in taste where you would need to close your eyes to sense the symphony of flavors but the more you dig into it the more you will taste the sweet and savory flavors that just dance in your mouth. Â Delicious.Roasted cauliflower with Parmesan sprinkled on top - 4 ratingI was loving this. Â The cauliflower was cooked perfectly and mixed with Parmesan, pine nuts, and lime. Â (I would give this a 5 but I've had a similar dish in LA at Lazy Ox that was PERFECT. Â This was a bit citrus-y)Fried soft shell crab - 4 ratingAnother dish that had a citrus-y taste. Â Like any other fried soft shell crab this was good and probably more flavory than most.Whole roasted pig face - 5+++++ ratingFuck this was so god damn good! Â My favorite dish next to the goat confit belly. Â The pork tasted like it was from the cheek area where it was braised then fried for the crispy exterior. Â My lord this is a must.Escargot ravioli - 5 ratingI never had a escargot prepared in a ravioli before and it was excellent. Â The ravioli was on the al dente side with a good piece escargot. Â The sauce reduction was SO GOOD. Â Altogether it made for one delish dish.Grilled baby octopus - 4 ratingThis was a VERY citrus-y to the point it was a bit too salty but nonetheless it's the best octopus dish I have ever had. Â Octopus is basically tasteless with that rubbery texture so you gotta dress it up like crazy and this dish was dressed up to the nine. Â It had multiple layers from the vinaigrette, beans, radish, and etc. Â Just tone down the saltiness/lime a little then it would have been perfect.Chocolate bouchon with foie fluff - 4 ratingI am not a huge fan of bouchons but the foie fluff sold me. Â The bouchon is very sweet so in order to taste the foie gras in the fluff with the bouchon you need to eat a good chunk of it to get that essence. Â You must eat it with the gooseberry compote to bring the foie gras flavor out even more.This place was worth the wait and the bill was not heavy either. Â For 7 dishes for 2 it was about $120 with tax and tip. Â Not bad at all. Â I wish this restaurant was in LA instead!"
Great food with a unique menu and excellent service - you can see what the raves are all about. Â  Only downsides are that it is practically impossible to get a reservation and it is so loud that you will be tired from shouting at your friends by the end of the evening.
"One of the best meals I've ever eaten! I didn't have high expectations because 1) I don't eat pork or red meat and 2) the menu looks frickin weird! Yet, somehow this fantastic chef makes the strangest looking combinations of food taste fantastic.Arrived for our 8pm Monday reservation and waited about 15 minutes at the bar. Fine considering it was packed! We had a group of 4 which seemed to be a great number to try many different dishes. I'd read in other reviews that the pig face was a big hit. My dinig companions were a bit taken back by it but thought it was fantastic. Some of my FAVORITE dishes were: the sauteed green beans, the chickpeas fritters, and the grilled baby octopus. We were there a few weeks back and I can still remember how good the green beans and octopus were! ORDER THESE! Loved the bread with some fancy flavored butter--so creative and a good start to the meal. The only dish we didn't like was a crab dish which would probably be delicious anywhere else but seemed too fried and bland compared to the rest of the flavor-packed menu. There were lots of dishes and drinks ordered and the meal seemed to be about $60 per person with tax and tip. Not too bad for one of the best meals of my life. Too bad I can't get reservations again for weeks!"
"Girl and the Goat is one of my favorite restaurants in the city. The place smells amazing. I almost never comment on decor, but I love the look of this place. The inside reminds me of charred oak bourbon barrels. On my most recent visit I started with an amazing cocktail called Grape and Grain. I did the scallops and sweet and sour cod cheek dishes, and both were very good. My favorite dish was the coconut braised pork shank. It was fork tender and fall off the bone amazing. The couple next to me ordered one as soon as they saw it. I'll remember that one for a long time to come. For dessert I couldn't decide between the apple or chocolate dishes so I asked my server to choose for me. He said I had to go with the chocolate, but I was brought both. The apple dessert was on the house. He was right, the chocolate was amazing, but the apple wasn't far behind. A place with food as amazing as this doesn't need to be that friendly, but they are and that gets them five stars all day!"
"We had been trying to get a reservation to Girl & the Goat for months and were finally lucky enough to snag a table at a decent time (5:45pm) the day after Thanksgiving. In short, it definitely did not disappoint! The atmosphere was fun and energetic. The service was out of this world. I am gluten free and our server took the time to walk through the entire menu with me and point out what was ""safe"" for me to eat. They even brought fresh-baked gluten free bread to the table! I was in heaven. We enjoyed everything we had, including the broccoli, scallops, goat empanadas and lamb ribs. The only nitpick I'd have is that the scallops were a tad over-cooked. But all in all, we felt this was an excellent restaurant, delivered great value and we can't wait to go back!"
"Like most people, I had to make my reservations months in advance for Girl & the Goat and naturally because of that my expectations where incredibly high. Fortunately, I had a great experience. The food was very eclectic and unique with flavorful combinations and I left there feeling very satisfied. The Goat Empanadas with Tzatziki sauce and the goat cheese wantons were fantastic. I have to try the green beans that everyone was raving about and they were great too. I made my next upcoming reservations for.....October. I will say, I was really surprised Â and how large the place was. You would think that with the wait list, it was some tiny place but it isn't. I just wish it was more accessible for people on a daily basis that just wanted to go out to dinner. A 2-3 month wait for a reservation at not 4:15pm or 10:45pm is a bit much,"
"Loved it. Ate here a while ago, but I still think about it."
"We just happened upon this restaurant on a whim. Â We looked on yelp while we were in the area and it had such great reviews. Â We didn't look at the menu before we waited to be seated. Â We were really skeptical at first, but everything was great!We had the culture club bread with fresh churned butter and beer cheese sauce. Â The butter was unbelievably awesome. Â We also had the goat sausage pizza, broccoli and goat shank. Â I was so skeptical about the goat, but it was a pleasant surprise. Â The meat did seem pretty salty though, which tasted good, but we're on low salt diets usually. Â Service was pretty good, but truthfully our server seemed a little condescending at times when we were asking questions about the menu. Â The menu is one of the most eclectic I've ever read and it was hard to choose our entrees. Â But we enjoyed trying something new and the atmosphere was lively."
"Ok, so the first time was a disappointment, but when Tony called me and wanted for us to come in again for a second go around, it was as fantastic as fantastic can be. All of the items we ordered were requested from the kitchen to reduce the amount of seasoning and they were all delivered with perfection. We had an amazing bottle of Pinot Noir to accompany some peppers, wood fired broccoli, salmon, quail, and the best of all dishes, sugo. Then we both had desert - chocolate cake and goat cheesecake. I wasn't a fan of the cheesecake (I felt like I was eating a slice of goat cheese), but my friend loved it! I suppose it depends on your taste buds. I'm a chocoholic so the chocolate cake was a natural choice.We are both looking forward to going back again to try the things we didn't try this time around. Thanks, Tony, for giving us the second chance!xoxo"
"Not going to review this in too much details as the previous reviews say it all... awesome place overall. Â The food is delicious and creative just enough. Â The environment is nice, not too loud, and it all comes together to really be a great dining experience every time - will keep coming back again and again."
"NOT GLUTEN FREE FRIENDLY!The website mentions that they have gluten free bread so I called and asked about gluten free options. They said they have an entire gluten free menu. Â After waiting several weeks (they didn't have any open reservations sooner than that), my girlfriend and I went for dinner. The place is loud and there is even rock type music playing in the background which made it even noisier. Â We were seated in a row of tables that shared the same bench on one side and had chairs on the other. Â While we did have our own table, I was about 14 inches from the people on either side of me. Â Conversation was difficult because of the noise level. There was a couple to my left and a couple to my right that seemed to be on a date. Â However, they were barely talking. Â My friend and I had to talk loud and we still could barely hear each other. The tables are so close that they have to be significantly moved if the person sitting on the bench side needs to get out to use the restroom.I asked for the gluten free menu and every dish except four (3 veggie dishes and one chicken dish) had asterisks by them, which meant that the item was cooked in a fryer Â or a grill along with gluten items. They do not have separate fryers or grills and I imagine that the GF bread I had eaten probably had been in the same oven as regular bread.Since my choices were limited, I ordered a broccoli dish, a roasted cauliflower dish and the chicken dish. Â While I suspect there was cross contamination, I didn't want to ruin my friend's birthday (she was looking forward to this for so long), otherwise I would have left. Yes, everything I ordered was delicious, but probably contaminated with gluten.The food prices are reasonable and the portions enough to share. Â We ordered a few cocktails and they were unique, fresh, and delicious:and about 13.00 a drink.There is a large lounge type area near the bar with a few sectional couches and small tables. Â This seemed like more the place to be: more room and more conversation friendly.If you are gluten sensitive or have Celiac's disease (like me), this is NOT the restaurant for you.If you do not, I would recommned giving it a try."
"Writing this review begins with me wishing I could make this 6 stars. Despite waiting over an hour for seats, we were able to find a spot to dine in the bar area, and begin, arguably my most epic meal of the year. The main section of the menu is divided into 3 sections, V, F and M. Vegetables, fish and meat, respectively. We began with the chickpea fritters and the hen of the woods mushroom ragout. The ragout was very tasty and started things off well for us food monsters. Another more notable dish was the escargot ravioli, which comes with bacon and tamarind-miso sauce. Epic. I would also recommend the pan-fried duck tongue. It was again, amazing. Yes, it is tongue, it tastes great. I also recommend the seared scallops and grilled spepia. The grilled pork shank was succulent and flavorful. All of the meat fell right off the bone. Now that is what I call poetry in motion. Now to my favorite dish of the night, wood oven roasted PIG FACE!! How can you turn down a dish called pig face?! It comes with sunny side egg, cilantro, tamarind, and thinly shredded potatoes. Seriously, can this get any better?! Yes, it can. Chocolate bouchon and their donuts to punctuate an epic meal. The environment was bustling, dim and industrial. There was a painting of a girl and a goat on the west side of the restaurant which was a little trippy, but cool nonetheless. The prices are reasonable and servings are small. Quality over quantity baby. We also had a great waitress who was very upbeat and helpful. We also scared her by ordering so much food, and making relatively short work of all of the culinary masterpieces. These are the times I just want to quit my job and become a food critic."
"We had planned a trip to IKEA this month, and with it I wanted to check out Girl and the Goat while I was out in Chicago. Immediately upon entering the restaurant, it has a wonderful, cool vibe. We came early at 5PM and already, every table was occupied. It has a nice, relaxed, bustling environment with a very eclectic mix of music.Ok, on to the food. I thought overall the food was good. We had the chickpea fritters, Mr. Potato bread, baby octopus salad, goat belly confit, and a steak dish. The chickpea fritters were amazing. One of the best dishes I have had in a long time. They were light as little pillows, creamy, and crispy on the outside. They also came with a delicious caponata which had fresh garbanzo beans with it. Mr. Potato bread was also another revelation. The bread came warm, crusty, and buttery. It was served with a potato aioli and a butter. Octopus salad was delicious as well with a long list of ingredients which still seemed to work well together.I was a bit underwhelmed with the other meat dishes I had. I think at first, the combination of sweet and savory tasted delicious, but my only complaint with Izzard's dishes is that after awhile, every dish starts tasting the same. I still enjoyed them nonetheless.I was disappointed with dessert. We had the pork fat doughnuts and chocolate cake. The chocolate cake was served with a foie gras marshmallow fluff, but I could not taste the foie at all. The milk chocolate ice cream served with it was good too. I was also expecting to be blown away by the doughnuts, but was a bit disappointed. They were good but not amazing. Overall, I still love the restaurant, and want to try many more items on the menu. I would love to try the fish dishes since I was not able to last time. Would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone."
"Here's the thing - everyone has such lofty expectations, and for good reason, but how can a place possibly live up to the hype that THIS place has gotten?? Â Right before my first visit to Girl & The Goat I had a few friends tell me that it wasn't all it was built up to be. Â Luckily, this tempered my expectation to a reasonable level. Â With that in mind, this place proceeded to blow me away. Â I absolutely loved the atmosphere - a fairly open floor plan, exciting/noisy environment (with conversation and good noise vs. music too loud and kitchen noise), and unbelievable food.I went during the summer so the menu worked blueberries and light vegetables into most dishes. Â We had the goat empanadas, pork belly, ham frites (skip these, they are just normal french fries), salmon, green beans...........and the one dish that will knock your socks off, CHICKPEA FRITTERS. Â I could eat those morning, noon, or night. Â Amazing.I'll be back."
"I would definitely eat here again when I'm in Chicago. It was a girls trip to Chicago in September and reservations were hard to come by even 2 months in advance. We still did not have any luck on Open Table during the week of our trip. Since 2 of us arrived one day earlier on a Thurs afternoon, we took a chance on walking in for the evening. It was well worth it! The first-come-first-serve seating at the bar / lounge area is interesting. You really had to hover...and can hover. It seemed to be expected by the seated patrons. The hostesses are pleasant and did a great job in knowing where you are. Well, we just scored seats at the bar when the hostess approached us to offer a seating at the gathering table. We took it...and it was close to the kitchen (open).Food: It is a creative use of ingredients such that it keeps you wondering what it will taste like before it arrives.Wood fired oysters with horseradish, bacon, preserved lemon - it's not overpowering in ""oyster"" taste. It's nice to see creativity with oysters. Most places who served cooked oysters overdo the additions or the oyster becomes overcooked so I usually do not order cooked oysters. I enjoy them raw most of the time.Hiramasa crudo with crisp pork belly, aji chili, caperberries -- deliciousWood oven roasted pig face (sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, potato stix). The much talked about ""pig face"" was just ok for us. Maybe I expected more blending of egg yolk and the taste of pork.At this point, I don't recall which bread or veggie dish we had. Overall, I enjoyed this experience and would recommend this place."
"I came here with my parents and surprisingly were able to grab a dinner table at prime dinner hours on a Sunday night. I have to say, my meal at girl and the goat is probably the second best meal I have ever had.The set-up is one in which the group shares plates, almost like a tapas-type. We started out with the sashimi peppers, which were great. Not only were they delicious, but there were tons, the peppers with miso and parmesan lasted until our last ""food"" dish of the night.The next dish was great. The goat chorizo flatbread with ajvar (still not sure what that is), apple, peppers and fresh ricotta was a surprising combination of flavors at first, but the flavors clicked and made a great dish. Then came an insane plate of the best french fries I have ever had in my entire life. The ""ham frites"" were served with a tomato aioli and a cheddar beer sauce that were both to die for. I cannot think of another plate of french fries that have even come close to these.The seared scallops were next up. The fact that these were the weakest dish of the bunch, and yet they were still a solid dish speaks to the quality of the meal. The highlight of the night came after. The confit goat belly came with lobster and crab that was delectable. Most likely in the top 5 dishes I have ever eaten, reading this dish on the menu gives me chills.The last dinner dish was oven roasted pig face and fried egg with tamarind and cilantro. Although quite good, this dish paled in comparison to the preceding one.Intrigued by the chocolate bouchon with a foie gras fluff, I had to order it. To put it simply, dessert did the meal justice (although I'm not sure whether there was a foie gras fluff), as the chocolate bouchon was amazing.All in all, eating at girl and the goat is a complete experience, and probably the second best meal I have ever eaten."
"My hubby made reservations for 5 about three months in advance. I had been wanting to go for quite awhile and it was worth the wait. The server recommended 2 dishes per person, so we ordered 10. Â I'm a pretty picky eater but was determined to try a bit of everything we ordered and was pleasantly surprised. The dishes were so well balanced that I wasn't able to distinguish those ingredients that I typically despise. The food was a little on the salty side, and all very rich. Â Could I eat here every weekend? Absolutely not. But it made for an amazing night out. I ordered one $13 cocktail (Best of Three- I think). It was worth trying, but I wasn't about to order a second. We ordered.... Pig face- of course, we couldn't miss their signature dish. It was worth trying but not my favorite.Escargot ravioli- i enjoyed the sauce on my dish. My companions weren't floored.Diver scallops- order this! Perfectly cookedGreen beans- again, perfectly cooked, beautiful color and the cashews really complimented the beansBroccoli- the smokiness was a little overpowering, but why have I not thought of blue cheese on broccoli!?Cauliflower- order this!Squash wontons- yummy, the sauce was a little saltyKona kampachi- my hubby thought this fell flat. It was lighter and had an interesting mix of textures.Sugo- the homemade noodles were fab. Personally I didn't love the texture of the meatGoat empanadas- the only thing we ordered that I didn't try... Oh well."
"I have dined at Girl & the Goat twice and can't wait to come back. Â Call me addicted but you can't help it with this place.The first time I dined here was with my hubby. Â My coworker was unable to go and gave me the reservations. Â What an amazing gesture. Â We came and stuffed ourselves silly. I love the idea of small plates. Â But, it also helps me continue to order more because they are small plates. Â We ordered many delicious items ( the menu is seasonal) but my favorite that night was the confit goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster and crab fennel. Â It was heavenly. Â The goat belly literally melted in your mouth. Close runner up was the roasted pig face. Â Unbelievable.The second time was for a friend's birthday and there was a group of 6 girls. Â We had to wait for a table even with a reservation but we weren't in a rush. Â We got a cozy table with the view of the kitchen and Stephanie Izard overseeing her magic. We ordered so many plates of food that we might have over done it. Â A few repeats from when I dined with the husband but again, you just can't go wrong with any dish you order. Â As we were finishing up our meal, the chef extraordinaire came around and even asked how we were doing. I can't wait to bring my parents and any out of town guests here. Â It will knock their socks off!"
"Service is some of the best ive ever had. Water is always filled and insight always provided. To the food- some small plates were incredible ( frog legs, pig face, goat empanadas, goat belly, and bread) while others were just good....I'd guarantee that everyone will love at least one dish. Reasonably priced too."
"I am not a 5 star guy but in this case I made an exception. Â After wanting to try this highly touted restaurant for a while, we finally reserved our spot. Â We were greeted well, had a drink at the bar and were seated on time, The atmosphere was great, a little loud but manageable and set the right ambiance. Â We ordered drinks and 4 dishes. Â Our server made recommendations then ordered everything up in the right order for us. The Escargot Ravioli was excellent in texture and taste. Then we had the Â Wood grilled broccoli which was a large amount and had a very good taste. We also had the Pig Face (crowd favorite) and finished the meal portion with the Confit Goat Belly. Â Both were just delicious. Â I would describe them more but the tastes were so unique that I couldn't do them justice. We finished up with the butterscotch dish which was perfect to end the experience. The night's experience was great (partly due to my date of course) but we both enjoyed it immensely and it lived up to it's hype. Well done!"
"Amazing food. The flavor combinations here are spectacular. Make sure you try the Crisp Soft Shell Crab with sweet corn, lime, and chili aioli ($15). The sweet corn and the sweet and buttery crab were great with the acid of the lime juice. The crab was perfectly prepared-lightly fried so it was tender and juicy when you took a bite, but also crispy. Our server, Amy, told us that the secret to the batter is to use sparkling water-I'd never heard this before but I will definitely be trying it!Another highlight of our meal was the Goat Cheese Bavaroise dessert. Image the smoothiest, fluffiest, lightest cheesecake with a toffee CrÃ¨me BrÃ»lÃ©e crust, layered on top of Â blueberries with a spongy brown sugar cake bottom. Creamy, rich, not too sweet, not too tangy. When you eat this, get a spoonful that will take you through all the layers in one bite."
"The service was excellent, the ambience was moody but fun, and the food was amazing! Â The oysters, diver scallops, and pig face (served with an egg on top) were out of this world - all a must try!!! The duck tongue was something different to try, but wasn't my favorite. Our waiter had perfect recommendations for us and really enhanced our dining experience. We ended with the best desert I've ever had in my life, the miso-butterscotch budino. Â I highly recommend going to this restaurant!!"
Great cup of coffee and delicious food. The shrimp and grits is amazing. It's so hard to choose 1 plate. Everything looks and sounds amazing. Must go if you're in Chicago.
"Never one to heed the words of iconic theologian, Kim Zolciak, it would appear I'm a bit tardy to the party. With over 9 billion yelp reviews written about it, it's mathematically possible that heretofore (whatever the fuck that means), I was the last man on earth to have dined for the first time at Girl & The Ghost. Your move, Good Will Hunting. Herein, this review is probably completely useless to most everyone. But you know what they say about me... ""Matt puts the fluous in superfluous,"" so this bitch is getting wrote. The good: everythingThe bad: nothingI don't recommend the goat chorizo flatbread though unless you love taco pizza. The ricotta, which I figured was going to be the Dolph Lundgren of the dish and totally kick some ass, wasn't just tardy, he was absent for the party (btw, why am I assigning genders to cheese?).Also, apparently I don't drink enough, because I thought the barrel-aged Manha'an didn't yield a noticeable difference from it's freshly mixed cousin. Were I to be aging cocktails, I'd probably do something a little zanier, like age Jagerbombs in a Beam and diet cask. With the ever present threat of Donkey Kong looming, however, it's probably a good idea to keep away from barrels."
"An interesting concept with some highlights, but overall disappointing.Four of us went on a Saturday night without reservations. Â We were told it would be 90+ minutes for a table, but were able to get seating at the bar.We started off with the squash wontons and the chickpea fritters. Â While all of the dishes can be shared, the wontons came three to the order, so I was the 'even' person out. Â My wife had one, and said it was overly sweet and that the fritter was much better. Â The chickpea fritter was very good with nice textures and flavors.We then got the kona kampachi crudo and ham frites. Â The crudo was quite tasty and the contrast between the cool kampachi and warm crispy pork belly made for an interesting dish. Â The frites were very good and came with two dipping sauces. Â Since the frites were like shoestring fries, our basket contained lots of 'bits'. Â Of the sauces, the smoked tomato aioli was the most memorable.We then moved on to roasted cauliflower, roasted beets, wood over roasted pig face, and confit goat belly. Â While all the items of our previous orders came pretty close together, these were staggered over the course of at least 30 minutes. Â The cauliflower and beets came first. Â I am not typically a big fan of either but tried each. Â The cauliflower was a huge portion compared to any of the other dishes and unevenly cooked. Â Some pieces were nicely charred with good flavor, while others were closer to being burnt and bitter. Â With the beets, I could not tell they were roasted, short of they were not raw. Â The whole dish seemed to be one note, just with different textures.The pig face came next, and is an attractive presentation with the sunny side egg on top. Â We were told to just 'mash' it all together. Â While the egg yolk added some much needed moisture, the dish was pretty dry and disappointing.Finally the goat arrived. Â Since this was the Girl & the Goat, I was looking forward to it. Â To me, something that is confit should just melt in your mouth - I couldn't cut it with a spoon. Â It was topped with a lobster crab mixture so the combination was very similar to the crudo we had earlier. Â It was an interesting dish, but not a marquee offering.To end our evening, we ordered the bittersweet chocolate and apple buckle. Â I am a chocolate lover, but the bittersweet chocolate dish was extremely sweet. Â It was topped with a shiitake-carmel gelato, so was an interesting concept, but nothing I would seek out. Â The apple buckle was a highlight, but mainly because it looked like a cobbler, and tasted like a cobbler.Overall, I was happy we went, but glad we didn't wait for weeks to get in with a reservation. Â Girl & The Goat - been there, done that, won't be going back."
"Ordered the famous pig face, Pork shank comes with naan!, peppers, green beans and i can not for the life of me remember what desert we chose ....damn wine lol Food was awesome especially the pork shank and green beans. Portions are generous had plenty to take home, hard to stop ordering with that type of menu Everyting looks good and with close tables you see everyone elses food and they share their opinions which of course no one is complaining. I do have to say some of Â the tables are really close they have to pull the table out to let the person sitting across from you in. However not all the seating is like this and really wasnt to bad enjoyed great conversation with people seated around us just a challenge for that person to get out. Service was excelllent loved our server.......can't remember her name....damn wine !"
"This was my first time at Girl and the Goat. A lot of people describe the food as different and delicious. To me it wasn't much of either. The food was enjoyable, that is about as far as I would take it. I would guess and say that if you are someone who has eaten the same/similar cuisine/s for most of your life, then yes this food would probably sweep you off your feet and be totally worth the 60 bucks that I payed. If you are someone who has grown up eating a foreign cuisine (Ukrainian for me) and cook/eat very diverse foods, this isn't anything too different at all. I shared the food with 3 other people: a vegetarian, who found her dishes to be too heavy, and 2 others who both thought the food was delicious. I thought that the saltiness of the food was what made a lot of it appetizing, which isn't an impressive aspect considering the prices charged. We had the following:green beans (yes)chickpea fritters (no)potato wontons (so plain)goat empanadas (yes but very small portion, better for 2)baby octopus (yes)escargot ravioli (yes)pork shank (yes)pig face (no, why is everyone raving about this dish??? I can make eggs and potatoes any time I want. And ok they threw some pork meat in there, cool.)desserts: napoleon (OK I didn't read the description and just assumed this was a Napoleon cake, got 2 scoops of decorated ice cream instead...)goat cheese bavarois (yes)Conclusion: my ale was good (north coast pranqster), our waiter was cool, the food is overpriced and I think I like Little Goat better."
"There was SO MUCH hype about this place that it's hard for any place to live up to such hype. HOwever, I can definitely say I'm a fan for all of the reasons:Ambiance: Deco was nice, simple, darker tones and nice wooden touches to the table - like a place to hold your menu while you eat so you can always order more small plates. THere's a place to sit in the bar section. It's not a huge restaurant, but it's not tiny either.Service: For a Tuesday night, it was packed. Service was pretty good but food came out a little slowly. Typically food comes out relative faster, but last night the food came out pretty slow. We had reservations for 7:15PM, got seated at 7:30PM, ordered right away (7:35PM) but had only two plates out on our table by 8:00PM-we were getting hungry. Two plates came out bt 8:00-8:15PM but by 8:15 we were hoping to be closer to finishing. We had to package three plates to carry out and left the restaurant at 8:40PM. Once we told our server we were trying to get out of the restaurant a little more quickly, he was very accommodating and apologized for things taking a longer time.Price: Expensive. For a dinner of two people, one glass of wine and five dishes/small plates - bill came out to be about $100 including tax and tip.Food: Menu is broken up into 3 sections: V (Vegetables), F (Fish?), M (Meat) and dishes were pretty darn good. Food comes in small plates so be aware. Here's what we got and ratings on them: Â  Chick Pea Fritters - Good, though it was an interesting flavor combination Â  Green Beans - Very Good. These came highly recommended. On the salty side. Â  Country Club Bread - Very Good. Soft, dense bread with butter and a cheese Â  sauce.  Â  Goat Chorizo Flatbread - Very Good. Â  Pork Ribs - Excellent. Great flavorful savoriness, meat was tender and came right off the bone. This was delicious. Â  Pig Face - Excellent. Everyone gets this. This was subtle yet very nicely done. Also delicious.Tips: - Parking : Valet is $10. Depending on where you're coming from, may be better to do take the Valet than to cab it bc parking in this area may be limited.- NOise Level: Especially on a busy night (which is pretty much every night) noice level is pretty loud.All in all, I'd come back again... it's a great restaurant and I'd definitely recommend, but to dine here again - it'll have to be in 3 months because it takes that long to get a reservation at this joint."
"Third time visiting G&G this week. Went with a larger, more adventurous group this time, and tried a lot more dishes. I'm increasing their rating to 5 based on my latest experience. Everything about this was perfect - Â delicious food, great service and great ambiance. And cheaper than some of the other high end places in Chicago. Definitely a place you'd want to visit multiple times."
The food is fantastic .Great menu of small plates. 1 1/2 wait turned into 2 hours. Hostess didn't really care when it if we got seated. I don't think that I would wait again( but you can make reservations 9 months in advance)
"A popular foodie destination in Chicago under Chef Stephanie Izard (winner of Top Chef season four). Â Difficult to make reservation for a decent time slot, so we decided to walk in at opening time. The lounge area next to the bar is a great place to relax with a glass of wine and some food. Â Sadly, the house red was too vinegary. Â We ordered the goat carpaccio, confit goat belly, and escargot ravioli. Â The goat carpaccio was drowned in oil, but I have to give them credit for making the dish over again. Â I like the escargot ravioli concept. However, I didn't think the new preparation add much to the tradition take on escargot. Â The goat belly was my favorite dish, and I recommend trying it out. Â  The dishes at G&G were decent overall, but I much prefer the nearby Avec and Publican."
"Amazing. Â We had a Saturday night reservation, and were surprised to get one of the two chefs' tables that are basically in the kitchen. Â We got the celebrity treatment for no reason at all-- aside from the phenomenal table we got a couple of courses on the house and the best, most attentive and genuinely caring service I've ever had in a restaurant. Â This was all without any mention if a special occasion or name dropping, which was really cool.The food was all delicious. Â Before ordering our waiter asked about dietary restrictions, and when I told him I didn't eat meat he volunteered several selections that could be specially prepared to be veg friendly. Â I really really appreciated this. Â I never ask for modifications to meals at nicer restaurants because it is usually frowned upon, and consequently am often limited in my selections. Â It was really nice to be able to choose from more of the menu here. Â My favorite items were the chickpea fritters, kohlrabi salad, and roasted broccoli. Â Cocktails were also delicious, I highly recommend the Lake Effect.To get a reservation for a Friday or Saturday night you'll need to call a few months in advance, but once you get here you'll see that it lives up to the hype."
"We had a great time at the Girl & the Goat. The service was honestly the best I've experienced in a restaurant. The staff is extremely proud to work there and it shows. They are honest and quick. Meals never felt rushed. Everything was delivered on time and at perfect temperature. Now the food! Oh boy! We started with the bread with the fig butter and wow! I don't even like butter but this was so damn good! We couldn't get enough of the fresh bread and sides! Then we had the cauliflower, the broccoli, the grilled octopus, the goat empanadas, and the chocolate dessert. The cauliflower was extremely delicious and this is coming from someone who does not like cauliflower. Oh, it was so good. The broccoli I could have done without. It tasted like eating wood chips from a campfire. Not the texture, but the actual taste. It was too 'fired' for me. However, the blue cheese seemed to tone it down which was nice but I wouldn't order it again. The octopus was so good! Great texture and flavours! The empanadas were the last of the sharing meal and they were really good! I was so stuffed by then. These four items were more than enough for two of us! We opted for dessert and were pleasantly surprised by the chocolate dessert. It was with a mushroom gelato which was amazing!! The flavours were so interesting, yet so delicious! We would highly recommend this restaurant!!"
Awesome Bar and food. Highly reccommend.
"Originality - 5 out of 5. Very unique - a fusion of flavors and tastes! This is definitely something that I've never had anywhere else. We came at 5PM and lucky they were able to seat us. Try going right when they open at 4:30! Taste - 4.5 out of 5. Chickpea fritters were my favorite, but I'm vegetarian and love chickpeas. Â My friends raved about the pig face plate. The squash blossom rangoonand grilled baby octopus were good. Service - Â 5 out of 5. Friendly and attentive which I appreciate.Ambiance - 5 out of 5. Classy, but also casual."
"Maybe we just ordered all the wrong things. Or maybe we had unrealistically high expectations. We managed to get an early reservation from Opentable the day before (score!) and at 5pm, the restaurant was only half full. The onion brioche that we started off with was the highlight of the meal. Everything else was pretty good but on the salty side. Tables for two were so close to each other that we had to push our table to the side for the inside person to be able to get out. All in all, everything was ok, but I don't think I would wait three months to dine here. My vote for small plates goes to the Purple Pig."
"Full discosure: Stephanie Izard is a friend of mine from well before she became famous via ""Top Chef,"" but she's truly brilliant. This is the best restaurant in all of Chicago, and I've tried damn near all of the supposed four- and five-star haunts. Her take on escargot ravioli may be the single most delicious thing I've eaten in my entire life. Just an amazing culinary experience, from cocktails to appetizers and entrees to desserts. What a cool place, too. Steph, you've outdone yourself."
"Absolutely amazing!That being said, its not a menu that everyone would like. You really have to be a lover of all foods or adventurous to appreciate this place. For example, they have tons of dishes with goat meat that are life-changing, but just the sound of 'goat meat' is a little strange. BUT they have tons of other options that are amazing and truly one of a kind. And, as if this place couldn't get any better, the staff is PERFECT! Our group was set for four, but when we grew to six unexpectedly, they gave us a bigger table without question or attitude. And we never had to wait or ask for anything. This is honestly one of the best places I've ever been!"
"5 stars for the phenomenal food and surprisingly great service.Yeah, yeah, I know that the wait time at this famous joint is ridiculous. I had a hard time believing that the wait without a reservation at 4:35pm on a Saturday was 1.5 hours (keep in mind that they open for dinner at 4:30). The converted industrial warehouse space is, afterall, pretty huge. Good thing the bar area is first come, first serve - and the bf and I were insanely lucky enough to snatch two seats immediately after we walked in. The lines only got longer and the crowds waiting by the bar more teeming with impatience. But you know what they say, good things come to those who wait. *Luckily I didn't have to.As I said, the service here is actually quite impeccable despite the craziness with the crowd. Our server and bartender were both attentive and helpful in explaining the menu and making friendly suggestions. It actually made dining at the bar exciting and enjoyable. Freshly poured wines at the bar doesn't hurt either, certainly; as the malbec I had was incredible juicy and rich, and the bf relished in a crisp sauvignon blanc.As for the food, everything we tried was delicious, with certain items nothing short of mind-blowing. First off, their freshly baked breads are definitely must-orders and worth the $4 price tag. We tried the bread served with tarragon butter and sweet pepper chutney out of the three options offered that day; the soft rolls were something like a biscuit meets brioche, fluffy, buttery and eggy in all the right ways. The tarragon butter was whipped and herbaceous as expected, and the surprisingly mellow fresh Â chutney totally worked. What really blew my mind however, were the wood fired broccoli with gorgonzola and rice crispies and the notorious pig face dish. The broccoli must have crack in it, because there is just no way broccoli can have such intense, complex and nutty flavor. Add the funky gorgonzola sauce and spiced rice crispies, and I promise this is one broccoli dish every child (or stoner) is bound to love no matter what. The pig face (which admittedly may sound intimidating to some) was decadent and just pork at its finest. The sunny side up egg on top added creamy richness, while the crunchy potato stix gave it texture. The tamarind sauce and what appeared to be a chimichurri added balance. What really makes the dish though, is the crispy, fatty patty of chopped up pig's face. I love that Chef Stephanie doesn't shy away from the natural flavor of unconventional animal parts, and knows how to work her magic to present such a plate in a way that any regular diner could love. We also ordered the squash blossom ragoon with crab, chive yogurt, and almond was very good as well - just not as impressive as the broccoli and pig face. So you'd think I could have stopped singing praises for Girl & the Goat after all the savory small plates. Well, apologies in advance, because I am about to go off on the dessert we had here as well. The particular dessert we indulged in, titled ""sweet corn and peaches"" with brown butter gelato and spiced caramel popcorn was perfect and nostalgia-invoking. Not only does caramel corn invoke beautiful memories of munching on cracker jacks as a child for me, but add the fresh corn pudding and ice cream, and the dessert was totally reminiscent of a summer day at the ballpark. Just much more grown up, much more refined. I am telling you, this place can do no wrong!All in all, I think Girl & the Goat is almost perfect in every way. It almost makes me contemplate moving to Chicago for good just so I can experience its deliciousness more often. Almost..."
"Hands down, the five stars should speak for themselves, the hippest place I visited on my trip to Chicago. My group decided on many different plates that were so good we almost forgot to share. It's one of those splurge places so prepare yourself. Casual dining meets fine dining in this rustic slick room. The vibe is bustling, our waitress so knowledgeable, and the servers very nice to look at -each one, a different flavor. We started with the octopus and kept the plates coming. Our bottle of rose was pleasant as a lot of the plates were rich, the carbonation helped cleanse our palates. I am looking forward to my next Girl and Goat experience."
"Portions were small but every bite was delicious. Favorite of the night: White Fish. While waiting at the bar, Bobby Flay entered and waited for a table. You know its good when another notable chef dines here. Drinks were great, in fact, I discovered a new favorite: St. Germaine with any sparkling wine and a slice of lemon zest."
"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said?My wife and I have been here on three separate occasions now and we've walked away each time feeling pretty good about the place.We've tried just about everything on the menu and there are some misses but there are far more hits. The seafood dishes are always amazing and if they have it, the shishito peppers are absolutely killer.The one dish I would suggest staying away from the is the pig face. Its not that I'm against eating a pig's face, I just don't like how its prepared. It comes in this weird patty form that neither resembles a pig face visually or in taste. Its by far the worst dish on the menu."
I would eat here every other day if I lived in neighborhood. End of story.
Amazing! The server will help you decide what to order. Everything we had was delicious and tasty. Flavor profiles are bold and rich. I would go back in a heart beat.
"Like they need my review. Â Delicious food, great atmosphere. Â Only problem is that I only go on the weekend nights when I have a date with they hubby so it's always crowded. Â Expand, G&G or open a place closer to my home without any advertising so that I can keep it all to myself. Â I promise to eat there a lot to make it worth your investment!"
Escargot ravoli and Octopus was DELICIOUS! I still crave for the it :P
"The grilled baby octopus was incredible. I followed with the crispy pig face & egg, wow that was good! I finished with the crisp braised pork shank & washed it all down with 3 Philosophers. What an amazing meal. Definitely recommend, couldn't give the 5th star because the food did run a bit late. worth the wait, but late."
"One of the best meal we've had.Spence Wheat - delicious wheat bread with peanut butter (more butter than peanut) and blackberry jam. Â I tried smeared them on separately and layered together. Â Both are good way to try this starter. Â The portion of the dishes are smaller than your regular restaurant offering, so it was nice to have this starter.Kohlrabi Salad - very light and delicate. Â Combined with the nutty flavor of almond and fruitiness of the blue berry, it was a palate cleanser before the next few dishes.Hiramasa Crudo - this fish is served raw with smokey crispy port belly. Â Top dishes of the night. Â Diver Scallops - scallops are my favorite if done right. Â This one is by far the BEST that I've ever had. Â Super smokey and crispy on the outside, and sweet (and I mean SWEET) and tender on the inside. Â The sauce is not the same as on their website, but it blows my mind! Â It was served with green papaya which made this dish nice and clean tasting. Â I can't remember the ingredients for the sauce, but has strong Asian influence. Â Goat Belly (tonight's special) - it was nice and tender. Â Well prepared with sprinkle of lobster and crab meat. Â I wouldn't say the flavor of the dish is unique or special given the ingredients, but it was nicely done. Â Overall, the experience was wonderful. Â Oh, and the two cocktails we tried was equally delicious... though slightly on the expensive side for drinks."
"We lived nearby and tried for months to get reservations with all the hype. We finally decided to try it in January after a big snow storm that was preventing us from reaching our originally planned destination. We were able to get a spot at the bar finally! Everything was delicious I must say, & I would definitely recommend trying at least once. Â They have a great wine list! However, I think it's probably the richest meal I've ever had around the world, so if you do go prepare for something very heavy and filling. While it all tastes good, I think they can probably cut back on the butter."
"I'm truly saddened that after waiting so long to eat here, I have give only two stars. Let me preface this review by saying that the service was not lacking, and our waitress had a great understanding of the menu. Service is a huge factor for me when writing reviews, but unfortunately could not save Girl & the Goat from the low rating.First of all - The entire restaurant filled full of smoke while we were there. When we asked our waitress what was going on (figuring that maybe a hood broke, etc), she said that this happens often. To remedy the problem, the front doors were opened. With it being 92 degrees outside, the restaurant heated up quickly (at least where we were Â - near the door) Â and became quite uncomfortable. The smoke did clear a bit,but when the doors were closed, it quickly refilled the entire restaurant. Our orders were in, and food was coming. I guess we could have opted to get it all to go, but as it was a birthday celebration dinner, decided to try and stick it out and enjoy ourselves. In hindsight, we should have left. Secondly - While the dishes and menu are creative and well presented, they were all heavily salted and far too rich for our taste. Third - Â I was surprised at how large the restaurant is. The only comparison that comes to mind is either Sear Sucker in San Diego (which I do like quite a bit) or a Cheesecake Factory (which I avoid like the plague). Â With this size, I feel as though the kitchen can't pump out the quality I expect for the price paid. Lastly, the biggest disappointment for me was that Stephanie Izard was actually there in the kitchen that night, Â and let the food go out this way + failed to offer any comps to people due to all the smoke in the room, etc. I can understand when a celebrity chef restaurant fails to meet expectations due to that person not being present (i.e. Bouchon in Vegas, etc) to oversee dishes, but with her actually there, and it being a Wednesday night, I would have hoped for more attention to detail.In closure, let me say that I appreciate Stephanie's work ethic (I follow her on Twitter, and she's a very busy woman), along with everything she's done for the Chicago food scene. Also from my observations of her charity work, Â I'm sure she's a great person all the way around. I wish her luck in the future, but from other people's reviews noting the same dislikes on the dishes, I hope her career isn't a flash in the pan."
"We were lucky enough to tag along with a group here It was a really over the top experience. I tried to take notes but here is the 101. Shoshito peppers, fried pickles, snail ravioli, and what I remember to be some braised pork shoulder? By this time things were getting fairly hazy. If you can get in go!"
"Since we were a large group, we basically depleted the menu items. The scallop is amazing. The grilled chicken is WAY WAY better than one would think. The 9 pounds goat leg is expensive and amazing. Whether you like lean meat or you like fat and tissue, you will find your cut. The grilled octopus and pig face is a bit of a disappointment. The wine is also pretty decent although I do not quite get the idea of using a legless wine glass..."
This was my first time their with my husband for our anniversary. Â  The waitress really made the whole experience special. Â The food and the service were incredible.
"If you haven't tried Girl & the Goat, get your ass there ASAP!I was one of 3 to get invited in this lovely spotlight event and let me tell you, I would've punched little babies to stay 24/7. Â Why? Â It was that freaking good!I would like to say, below comments were being said all night...""WWWWWWWHHHHHAAAAATTTTTTTTTT?""""NOOOOOOOOOOO WWWWAAAAAAYYYY""""OOOOOHHHHH HEEEEEELLLLLLL NOOOOOO""Kohlrabi salad = Fennel, evalon, toasted almonds, blueberry with ginger dressing. Â AWESOME-O. Â And I don't even like fennel. Â Small amount but nontheless, it was enough for us to share between 4 people.Chickpeas fritters with romesco, hazelnut hummus, sesame and goat feta. Â Feta cheese? Â Get out of here!Grilled baby octopus with guanciale, Â wax beans, radish, favas. pistachio-lemon vinaigrette - This was one of my favorite. Â Alot of restaurants tend to over cook the octupus and becomes a rubber. Â This one had the perfect chewyness with sourness from the vinaigrette... yummy!pinn oaks lamb tartare with english pea tapenade and tuna aioli, it comes with crackers. Â DELICIOUS!Lamb ribs were delicious, cooked perfect medium rare.There were some other dishes which I can't remember and the desserts were good (as per Yelpers since I hate sweets). Â Pork fat doughnuts was nice and fluffy but I couldn't stand the damn chocolate that was on the bottom. Â Then again, you can never go wrong with the pork fat! Â Thank you again Yelp and J.T.!! for letting me experience one of the best restaurants in Chicago!Did you know that GNTG has multiple separate bathrooms for boys? Â I sure didn't know, I was looking pretty stupid standing in front of a door waiting for the other dude to finish his business. Â And they are located second deck below on the port side of the entrance. Â (little naval terminology for you)"
"Great food/wine/atmosphere, though the duck tongues + pig face were a little to rich for my palette when eaten at the same meal."
"I was there this weekend for an anniversary with my GF and enjoyed the entire experience. We were very lucky to get reservations at 6:15 and when we arrived the staff made us feel like we were very special and we were treated so well. We were seated at the chef's table and it made the experience even more enjoyable. Our server came almost immediately to our table and made us feel like we were the only people in the restaurant that he was serving. He took time to explain the menu as it was our first time there, introduced us to the chefs cooking in front of us, made recommendations, etc. We perused the menu for a little while and based on some recommendations from the chefs and what we saw them making that looked good we placed our orders. We ordered the wheat bread with bacon butter and it was a great start to a wonderful meal. Next came the loup de mer filet and it was the best thing we had that night (thanks to the chef's recs) and after that came the wood grilled broccoli which was charred, a little spicy and really tasty, and finally finished with the braised beef cheeks were were so tender you could cut the meat with a fork. We were also treated to a complimentary taste of dessert since it was our anniversary and it just capped off a wonderful and very special night. All in all a really wonderful eating experience thanks to very attentive staff and very delicious food thanks to wonderful chefs. I will definitely be gong back on my next visit to Chicago!"
"A Special night for my partner and I, Â visiting from Albuquerque and hanging with my brother. Â The drinks really got the conversation flowing and it was all fun for the next three hours. Service was attentive and very friendly. Here is a review of the food and drinks:Drinks...The Lift Ticket was complex and robust, lovd it and it did take you to the top. The 4:15 to Georgia was also great, not too sweet , just right. We had another that was like a margarita but with vodka...nothing so special but good if you just want a clean fresh taste. Starters and veges: The roasted cauliflower was amazing, do not miss it. The beet salad was good but not hugely memorable...there are a lot of beet salads around now, no? The hot shishito peppers were flavorful and spicy, a nice finger food and compliment Â for other dishes. Â We also started with gluten free bread, a real treat for my gluten free girlfriend. It was chewy and the special butter and onion jam were tasty. She was just so happy to get to enjoy bread out at a restaurant...a realtreat Â for GF followers. The cowboy oyster sounded exciting but was a fried oyster on a rich bed of egg salad...came off a bit flat and uneventful...there are better things to enjoy, so do not waste your stomach space on these.For mains we had the kona kompachi crudo which was delicate and tasty, a nice contrast to the rich meats we also ordered...the pig face which was a really interesting combination of flavors and the goat neck which was sweet and rich, a perfectly prepared braised meat and it was a very generous portion. No little bones to pick around, just sweet chunks of meat. These last two mains were rich but the fish balanced it a bit and the end, we were pleased with all of our selections.Although full, we could not resist trying the desserts: we had bittersweet chocolate cake, which was good, like it always is, but not spectacular and we had the butterscotch budino, which Â was way over the top, too sweet ( and I like sweet), and the pineapple was a strange addition, not adding anything. For me, the chunkiness of the additions to this budino detracted from the blissful creaminess that Â I have experienced with this dessert elsewhere ( notably, Farina in Albuquerque). This dessert tried too hard.But, in total, we loved the meal. and the whole experience. Â I would definitely go again when we are back in town."
"This is one of my favorite places to eat ever. I come here every time I'm in Chicago. The food it always fun and exciting, the service is awesome, and it has nice ambiance.I really loved the goat empanadas and the cauliflower is amazing. I try to always ask the waiter for recommendations and I am never disappointed."
So yummy and casual!! Loved it! One of my favorite restaurants in Chi!
"It's a bit of an anomaly - gourmet food served in a family style setting... trendy, yet warm & comfortable... I was drawn to the place because of its hype, but immediately felt right at home. Â The restaurant does not disappoint! Â I've visited with just one other person & sat at the kitchen bar (awesome!). Â I've gone with a couple of friends and sat at a small table. Â I have also taken our entire family there and dined at one of the larger tables. Â Each time was a fun experience with flavorful food that impressed everyone's palate. Â The servers here are educated and helpful, plus I've almost always had the opportunity to speak directly with Chef Izard - who is just as friendly, as she is talented!While I know that she is known for her meat dishes, some of my personal favorites do not contain meat. Â My favorite must-have at the restaurant is the roasted cauliflower! Â I also LOVE the homemade bread & butter, too. Â Most recently, I did dine there with a vegetarian friend and even she left satisfied and vowed to return!This really is a MUST visit when coming to Chicago! Â Enjoy!!"
"We weren't able to get a table even at 11pm at night right away, but we were able to sit in the lounge and bar area and get food and drinks there. It was a small wait. Â The place was dimly lit and relaxed, and the music was really chill. Â It was a comfortable couch, and our server was informative and gave great recommendations. Â We were just here for dessert and drinks, so I can't comment on an actual meal. Â I had the Andrew Rich Gerwerstraminer and we had the chocolate bouchon and the apple dessert, and both were delicious. Â Even the after taste of all the things I ate and drank were memorable. Â It definitely makes me want to come back and have a meal here though."
"We called a month early, and the best we could do was a Tuesday night reservation for 3...... at 10:15 pm. We walked in and it was like a Friday night at 8pm at most restaurants. Wall to wall people, full bar, all tables are full. Impressive. We grabbed some wine at the bar, and waited patiently for our reservation. We showed up early, but we weren't seated until 10:15 on the dot. Our server was great. Lots of suggestions, and very knowledgeable on the food, and the restaurant itself. Since we went for my friends goodbye dinner, she politely asked if Stephanie was around, and if so, could he send her over to say hello. He said it was doubtful, since they were so busy, but she came through and made a stop by. She was very humble and gracious, posed for a picture, and thanked us for coming in. The food, in short, was amazing. We ordered way too much, but we ate it all. Although they say ""small plates"" they don't really mean it. There's plenty of food in each portion to go around. The only thing I didn't love was the cauliflower... it had a mint flavor to it... not my fave. I did however love the Sugo. Get it. You won't be sorry. Â We ordered a berry crumble/vanilla ice cream combo for dessert. delish. Seriously, everything we tried on this menu was phenomenal. Very affordable for what you're getting. After 8 small plates, a bottle of wine, bread, and dessert, we walked out of there for 62 bucks per person, including tip. Not too shabby!"
"I LOVE this place!!!! we made reservations 3 months in advance. The long wait was well worth it. We were visiting Chicago for the first time and we were gonna do it right! The ambiance and decor was really amazing. Very open space and yet intimate feeling. Our server was really friendly and offered great selections for us on beers. When we didn't like the beer he gave us to try he actually let us order without charging us extra. We started off with their Shishito Peppers with parmesean, miso, and sesame. The chefs working were telling us to get that so we HAD to try it. It was AMAZING. The miso and parmesean goes soooo well together. The peppers weren't even that spicy. Their Grilled baby octopus with guanciale, wax beans, radish, favas, and pistachio-lemon vinaigrette was a great play on textures and flavors. I've never had cooked octopus done so well before.We also got their fried rainer oyster with egg salad and capers. I normally hate capers but it didn't over power the dish and the oysters were perfectly fried. I absolutely loved this dish. SO much flavor! The chef gave us a sample of their lamb tartar. I was a little hesitant at first because i've never had raw lamb before. But i LOVED it. Â I don't remember what they mixed it with but it wasn't game-y at all. well seasoned and savory. They also gave us their asparagus with fried egg Â on top on the house. I was almost too stuffed to eat but i ate it anyways. I love asparagus, but they grilled it to perfection and the runny egg was a fantastic touch.We got their Pig face at the end. OMG it is to DIE for. If you get the chance to come to Girl and the Goat you HAVE to get the pig face. They basically take the different meats on the pig's face and make it into a pate and then grill it. Its so got many different flavors. its divine.Even though we were stuffed full at this point, the waiter insisted we try their dessert. We got their bittersweet chocolate with shiitake mushroom ice cream and toffee creme fraiche. SHIITAKE MUSHROOM ICE CREAM! how can you NOT try it. Its not too fungus-y at all. The ice cream only had a HINT of shiitake mushroom but it was there alright. The toffee creme fraiche was sooooooo good with the bittersweet chocolate. I think what topped off my night besides the AMAZING meal was that we got to meet Stephanie Izard! She was so humble and so nice. She gave us some great advice about when to do walk ins at her restaurant if we ever come back to chitown for another visit. You can walk in on Sundays and Mondays and it shouldn't be hard to get a seat! Honestly i cannot say enough great things about Girl and the Goat. They have such a great staff working there and the food is unbelievable. recap:1) Try everything that they suggest2) save room for dessert3) they have fantastic bread that's made fresh by their own baker"
"I can't say enough about G&G. I've been here twice now and look forward to many more visits! Stephanie Izard is a genius. The combinations of flavors are unexpected and delicious. I was told to order the green beans and boy am I glad I did! I can't say that I would ever pick green beans off of a menu but in the end one of my top dishes! Other favorites include the tuna, scallops, escargot ravioli, pork ribs, and the duck fat doughnut! Currently my favorite restaurant."
"The bottom line is Service: helpful and friendly staff. Bar staff was very welcoming and happy to answer questions.Food: Here's the thing - the dishes were all good BUT someone was off w/ the salt. Â Way salty. Â All the dishes were and that makes me think someone wasn't tasting or their tasting was off. Â The dishes were all complex and had plenty of flavors hiding under the salt so I'd like to go back and try it again. Space: Fun, energetic, clean... broken up enough that you don't feel like you're in as big of a space as you really are.Drinks: Only had beers, but they were good."
"Wonderful restaurant! The food is delicious & nose to tail with offalings of ""Pig Face"", duck tongues (bill to tail?), etc. Smoked goat empanadas were tasty, the pig face was delicious, green beans with toasted walnuts & a great sauce was a great side. Reservations are impossible to get (multi-months in advance required) and it is noisy. Also, you may get put at one of the community trestle tables. All worth it."
"Had the opportunity to be treated to a large business dinner here. Â Oh wow. Â The combinations of food, the creative use of the very best ingredients, and the great albeit casual service was just perfect. Â Favorites? Â The chickpea fritters, the goat neck, the fried oysters stood out but everything was a delight. Â Surprising me the most was a crispy whitefish on a goat ragu. Just amazing. Â Go!"
"The hype is well-deserved. Friendly, knowledgeable and responsive service was just a part of it. They accommodated the shellfish allergy at the table without making the rest of us miss out on the deliciousness of the clams and made amazing recommendations for dishes. For starters, I want to live in a vat of the mushroom butter that we got at the bar while waiting for our table. That plus the onion jam started out the night with one of the best bites of food I'd ever eaten and it just kept getting better. Be brave. Try the crispy duck tongues --they were probably one of the most unique things I've ever eaten and they were absolutely delicious. But honestly? Every one of the 17 dishes we sampled --apps through dessert -- was memorable and divine. My favorites were the escargot ravioli, the perch with clams and the sugo, but we can't wait to go back and sample more. The only complaint was the dessert with fennel was a little heavy on the fennel but whatEVER. Easily of the best meals we've eaten in Chicago."
"I finally made to Girl & the Goat! I know...you are probably wondering what took me so long, but I just had to gear myself up for the wait. Â So, when some co-workers suggested we leave work a little early and have some drinks when they open before having dinner, I jumped at the chance. The staff is on top of their game and we had a drink at the bar before sneaking in for dinner at 5:30. Â They told us that they needed the table back in an hour, gave us an extra 15 min, and the entire time they didn't rush us at all.We started with two of their breads, then moved on to the cauliflower, brussel sprouts, octopus, goat empanadas, pork ribs, beef ribs, scallops, cod cheek and fries. Everything we had there was amazing. Â Great flavors and great food. Â I loved that it's small plates and there were lots to try and i feel like even though we ordered a lot of food, we were still able to try a lot of different things.I would definitely go here again, especially in the summer when the menu changes so that i can indulge in all the Girl & the Goat goodies."
Great Place. Great Food.It takes super long to make a reservation. So be prepared to wait at least a month! Small cute food portions but delicious!Wouldn't recommend to go here if you are hungry. Â Wouldnt recommend here for big groups either!!
"One of the all around best restaurants I've ever been to. Visited Chicago from SF w/ my girl, and was able to get a 4:30 pm reservation (2 months in advance) on our last night.... We ordered a ton -- everything, literally everything, Â from the interior, to the service, to the cocktails, to the breads, to the pig face, to the goat belly, to the shitake gelato dessert, were unbelievable. Â Get the pig face."
"This is a hard place to get a reservation so we were excited to try this restaurant out. It is great for groups so you can try multiple dishes which are all made to share. We had the sauteed green beans, escargot ravioli and wood oven roasted pig face were very good. The confit goat belly was ok. The goat itself was tasty but mixed with the seafood was a bit much. For dessert I would definitely get the miso-butterscotch budino. The sticky date cake was just ok compared to the budino which was reaaaally good! Great atmosphere and knowledgeable, friendly staff members."
"We were lucky. So very, very lucky. We got in same day, made no reservations, just our luck a group of 4 canceled and we took their table. That and my friend had been there a couple of times and was friendly with the staff. All four were happily fed and left with lips smacking into the cold Chicago air. Roasted beets Â - green beans, white anchovy, avocado dreme fraiche. Gobbled upChickpea fritters, eggplant-tomatillo caponata, crave brother's mozzarella - oily, good, small portion (it was under vegetarian). delicious flavorpan fried shishito peppers, parmesan, sesame, miso - this was the one that I didn't think go over so well. not enough diversity of flavor hiramasa crudo, crisp pork belly, aji chili, caperberries - great pairing of the raw fish with pork belly. One of my favoritesgrilled baby octopus, guanciale, romano beans, radish, pistachio-lemon vinaigrette -awesome, no complaints kalbi style beef ribs, grilled sweet potatoes, charred okra - great pairing with the potatoes and okra. at this point we were getting fullpulled goat shoulder (special) - the goat shoulder came with crepes to wrap the meat. The juices ran down as we bit and ripped our teeth through the succulent and soft meat"
there are not enough stars to rate this place how i really feel. Â every single dish is out of this world and leaves you wanting more. My favorite restaurant in Chicago.
Awesomeness!! Enough said.
"I love that this restaurant makes so much sense.1. The bathrooms are unisex: no more waiting for the ladies room.2. Â Sharing appetizer-sized food brings friends closer together.3. Stephanie Izard puts together ingredients not typically seen together, and the result is phenomenal. Â Tasting the kohlrabi salad is like that scene in Ratatouille, where the rat gets an orgasm in his mouth. Â 4. And then again, when having a bite of the goat carpaccio. Â I could go on, but I don't want to start getting cravings.5. The only slightly negative thing is that the tables are pretty close to each other, so you can hear other patrons droning on about billable hours, and who they hired today."
"Sugo, scallops, skirt steak!!"
"Not much to add to previous raves. Reservations, service & food all first-rate. Although we couldn't tear ourselves away from the beer selection, we were tickled to see not one, but two GrÃ¼ner Veltliners on the wine list!What also impressed us was the sense of discovery in each plate. We live in the UK, where amateurish food is often presented as an architectural masterpiece. We'd rather it the other way 'round, with expertly-cooked food arranged on the plate in a way that pleases the tongue rather than the eye. Â Sorry, but one star off for the poor attention to acoustics. Loud restaurants are fine, but the volume level during our visit kept us from enjoying our meal as much as we were enjoying our food."
"While visiting a friend in Chicago, I knew that no matter what it took, I wanted to dine at The Girl and The Goat. I'm a big Top Chef fan and Stephanie Izard was one of my favorite cheftestants on the show.My friend and I had planned on getting to the restaurant at opening, but didn't make it over until around 6:00. We were told the wait would be an hour, so my friend and I hunkered down by the bar to wait it out. Well, the ""hour"" wait turned into well over an hour and a half. I was a little peeved, but everything I'd heard about the restaurant had me thinking it would be worth the wait.Sure enough, once we got seated and started eating, dinner was delicious.We started dinner with the butternut squash bread--appropriately sweet from the hint of squash.We decided to stick with mostly vegetarian small bites. The chickpea fritters, served with tomato-eggplant caponata and mozzarella, were flavorful, with a bit of crunch and nutty flavor from the chickpeas.The pan-fried shishito peppers were surprisingly spicier than I expected them to be--I could only eat a few before I needed to take a break. The Parmesan, sesame and miso on top were unexpected--I would never expect these two flavors paired together, but they actually made for a tasty combination.The hen of the woods mushroom ragout was a great bite of sweet and savory. The earthy mushrooms were served with sweet potato agnolotti for the perfect combination of fall flavors.The seared scallops was the only proper meat bite we tried. The scallops were perfectly cooked--tender inside and lightly caramelized. They were paired with pumpkin, Brussels sprouts, pomegranates and pecans--all my favorite fall foods together in one dish!We decided to stop after four small bites to save room for dessert--even though it pained me seeing all the other great selections on the menu. But saving room for dessert was definitely a good decision--the two we tried were excellent, incorporating savory flavors into a traditionally overly sweet final course.The apples, served thyme honey and crumbled marcona almonds, were flavorful, cooked with a touch of spice. But the real star of this dish was the accompanying blue cheese gelato. I've had cheese-flavored ice creams--like mascarpone or ricotta--but never one with blue cheese. The tartness of the cheese made for a great mix-in with the sweet ice cream, and it paired perfectly with the spiced apples.We also tried the pork fat donuts. I'm thoroughly in support of the gourmet donut trend that's sweeping the country right now, and these were no exception. The honey yogurt was a nice light complement to the decadent donuts. The eggplant was surprising--I'd never had eggplant in a dessert, and I was skeptical how it would work, but it turned out perfectly. The hint of lemon took off the savory edge.I was impressed with dinner, even from our limited sampled of small vegetarian fare. The food was simple, yet sophisticated with putting unique flavors together for unexpected--and sometimes unusual--tasty combinations.Despite the full house, the kitchen was sending out delicious foods without much of a wait. And the servers worked together in perfect harmony to deliver food, refill water glasses and answer questions without skipping a beat.While it took a while to get a table, the wait was totally worth it for that delicious dinner. Next time, of course, I'll plan better to get to The Girl and The Goat right at opening--or better yet get a reservation. And I'll certainly save room to sample more of the menu!"
"One word: WOW! You will not be disappointed coming to this place. I did not have any trouble getting a table for two, on a Thursday evening at 6pm, that is because I made the reservation 3 months ahead of time!! I love the decor of the place, dark wood, nice open area, you can come in a big group or just a couple and still feel welcomed and warm.The food was so good that it's indescribable! I know that this doesn't help since i'm writing a review, but seriously, I love how the small plates really help us trying different things and yet still feel full (unlike other small dish places like tapas or dimsum). My favorite, hands down would be the pig face! The meat was tender, well seasoned and just simply a delight! Another highlight would be the ribs, I've never tasted more tender/juicy ribs, and I've tried a lot of rib places in Chicago.The price I think for the quality of food and service, among other things, is fair. In Chicago you could def. pay more for less food/tasty-ness of food. I would definitely go back (preferrably with a bigger group, so that I can try more dishes), if it weren't so booked up all the time!"
"Awesome food! Come hungry. I was a little reluctant at first, but you have to try the Pig's Face! Best thing ever."
"Definitely overrated... I was soooooo excited to try this place with all of the incredible reviews...and long wait to get a reservation for a weeknight... But the food was overall just ok... The breads were incredible with the mushroom butter and the tomato oil! Loved the broccoli...hated the mushroom ragout (had a funny taste)... The fried pickles made everyone at the table gag...but the shishito peppers were incredible. Â The pork shank was delicious...mmmmm...but the chicken was just fair...the dish isn't too easy to share, unless you want to take turns ripping the chicken meat off of the bones.... I guess you shouldn't leave without trying some goat...the goat belly was good.... Overall, we were disappointed because we had such high expectations... Worth a try, but doesn't live up to the hype!"
"Let me start by noting that I reserved my table well over two months ago (and could only get a 6:45 res. on a Friday) and have been looking forward to my first experience here with much anticipation. Â We mistakenly arrived very late for our reservation, Â but our host graciously found a way to seat us with only a 45 minute wait, less than half of what the walk-ins were being told. Â We then proceeded to the bar, where the attentive staff there reached out to us in a very crowded bar scene and made us some wonderful drinks.Once we were seated, our waitress approached us immediately. Â She was no-nonsense friendly and extremely knowledgeable about all of the menu items and wine choices. Â I was struck by her ability to characterize each and every one of the pinot noirs we were considering. Â She really knew her stuff.Unfortunately, from here on out it was a rapid decent into various unappealing small plates smothered in flavorless fats (mayonnaise, butter, oil, melted cheese) - bizarre pairings on a plate that completely lacked coherence whatsoever. Â Pan fried shishito peppers were smothered in grease. Â A plate of yellowtail sashimi paired with fatty pork belly and a mayo devoid of any flavor followed.Menu choices that made it almost impossible for any reasonable person to put together what I would call ""dinner."" Â The wine list was extremely limited and, frankly, rather poor. Â Ever looked at a menu and felt like you could order just about anything there? Â Well, imagine the opposite were true. Â When we looked at this menu, it was really a struggle to find something you might enjoy eating. Â And we both arrived with healthy appetites!The first three items delivered to our table were so awful that we asked our waitress to cancel the remaining choices on order, which she kindly agreed to do. Â We settled up and left.Perhaps my expectations going in were unreasonably high. Â But as I've now had two days to reflect on the food we were served and the overall menu itself, I can honestly represent that it was really bad. Â Had we been served these items at a corner eatery without any expectations, I'd have had the same reaction.This is a sleek spot with a nice vibe and solid service across the board. Â But the actual culinary experience, once by all the peripherals, is a total and complete bust! Â And it ain't cheap either. Â There is too much good food in this city to waste time at a place like this. Â Go for a drink perhaps, and soak in the vibe, but get out before you actually need to eat. Â This was terribly disappointing in so many ways. Â In fact, I'm inclined to call it a fraud...."
"It was good, but considering how long you have to wait to get a reservation, that is strictly the hype. Â It is just like any one of 100's of Chicago small plate/weird meat/I can charge you for the vegetables now type restaurants. Â Only complaint, it was salty, but at least they keep the water coming. Â Definitely get some bread, if not with your meal, then you can buy it at their bread store across the street. At least you have to give them credit for expanding to meet the demand, with a restaurant, diner, and a bread/bar/coffee shop too!"
"their pan fried shishito peppers are ok, nothing extremely special about them, their wood grilled broccoli was good, but my most favorite item was their steamed west coast mussels and crisp braised pork shank. Something definitely different about how they prepared their mussels. And don't forget to ask for more bread cause the sauce the mussels are swimming in is super delicious! If I come back, the pork shank and the mussels are the two dishes I would definitely get again."
"Girl and the goat Â dark, pretentious ,over rated and the food overcooked And the wine glasses awful"
"Went out with 5 others tonight, made the reservations about 3 months ago. Â This is my third time dining there, and again, it was worth the wait and lived up to expectations.For our group, the server, Jess, (AMAZING) told us to order 12-15 dishes for the group. Â We did, but after she saw what we wanted, she was more than helpful getting us to narrow down our choices, which in the end, was a god-send. Highlights from the group: diver scallops, ham frites, green beans, pork shank, and if you haven't had them, the sushito peppers are a MUST! Â Only Â like 1 in 14 are spicy, but they are so flavorful.The common phrase of the night was that everything was so flavorful. Â I have to agree. Â I would try this place for sure, I think it's worth the hype!!"
Girl & The Goat is back. Must try the Falafel dish. Another awesome experience.
"This was definitely a dining experience. This reviews is few months out, so I'm sure the menu has changed. I liked most of the small plates. The pig face was just as delicious as others have said. The frites were also delicious. I didn't think everything was GREAT though. The scallop dish was a bit flavorless and the shrimp dish was also blah. I felt a bit mislead by the server. Granted, we really SHOULD have done our research before hand, however, she talked us into the goat leg and didn't tell us how much it cost ($125), nor how big it was. She told us we should order 4-5 dishes beforehand. There were four of us. The goat leg could have fed 20 people. We were too full to even make a dent in it. We split it and lived off it for the next week. Most likely, we will not be back."
"Girl and the Goat hits on all cylinders. Â It is a great space with a cool and casual vibe. Â The service is outstanding, simultaneously attentive, friendly and helpful without ever being overbearing. Â At my most recent visit, our server Jessica was amazing, navigating us through the menu and the meal with near ESP, knowing what we wanted before we even knew we wanted it. Â And most importantly, the food is just wonderful. Â It is my favorite place to eat in this country. Â It puts out complex yet accessible food in a way that doesn't take itself too seriously and doesn't cost an arm and a leg. Â On my most recent trip there, I went with a friend who is pregnant, allergic to nuts, and vegetarian. Â The restaurant artfully accommodated the dietary restrictions with grace, never once making it feel like such accommodations were something out of the ordinary. Â Moreover, the outstanding vegetarian options were substantive and creative, not relegated to mere side dishes.I've eaten at Alinea and Per Se, Daniel and Le Bernadin, and loved them all. Â I admire their excellence, their artistry. Â But I wouldn't and couldn't go back to those every night or even every month. Â You wouldn't want a whole plate of Alinea's truffle bombs or Per Se's Oysters and Pearls. Â But I could eat Girl and the Goat's deconstructed lengua tacos till the cows come home. Â Ditto for almost everything else on the menu. Â Whenever I'm going to be in town, I try to find a way to get myself to West Randolph Street for more."
"Apparently the wait for a table is two months? Worth it. I was in Chicago for work and decided to see what the hype was all about... Went on a rainy Saturday and was hoping to get a seat at the bar, waited about an hour, and still no one budged. Finally, a seat opened up in the living room/lounge area and slipped right in real quick. I thought I would be uncomfortable dining by myself there but soon enough, the people dining nearby were throwing recommendations my way and offering up what to get on the menu, I felt right at home!I wound up getting the following, and all were phenomenal:-chickpeas fritters . eggplant-tomatillo caponata . crave brother's mozzarella-grilled baby octopus . guanciale . wax beans . romano beans . radish . pistachio-lemon vinaigrette -wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stixNext time I go back I'm getting the Sugo... I heard it's unreal."
"Baaaaah. Oh whops, that was sheep. Same thing right?I'm not going to write a detailed paragraph on each dish that me and ALL my pals ordered. Â Long story short: you can't go wrong and all the hype is TRUE.From the quality and taste of the dishes, to the spectacular drinks, earthy/modern decor and fab wait staff. Chicago doesn't get any better than this."
"We did it... we made our reservations a month in advance for an early Monday night dinner. Â The food was great, but I don't think we will be back. Â Though the food and service were excellent, I don't know that it was worth the hype or $$. Â We sat in a small corner and were bombarded with flashes of our neighbors taking photos with a very bright flash every time something new came to their table... that may be an influence on my decision not to come back along with the months of lead time. Â Our favorites were the escargot ravioli and roasted Â cauliflower. Â The drinks were also excellent!"
"A dinner three months in the making. No seriously, I had to make reservations for my August Girl + Goat dinner back in early May. By the time I got to eat at G+G so much had changed. Chicago had sworn in a new mayor. Lollapalooza went from an idea to full palooze. The Bulls still had championship dreams. And the Cubs, well, they still stink. With a wait so long just to get a table, it's almost impossible for any restaurant to live up to the hype, but Girl + Goat somehow manages to do just that. Girl +Goat features an impressive diverse menu. You can get anything from pig face to lamb heart to duck tongue (who knew ducks even had tongues?). While there were hits and misses in the many small plates we tried, overall the quality of everything was top notch. Girl + Goat offers four freshly baked varieties of bread daily. I know it's $4 for bread and bread is usually free, but seriously, don't cheap out and skip it. The bread was one of the highlights of our meal. We had the Dock of the Bay bread which was delicious and served with lobster butter and a remoulade. I would drink a glass of lobster butter if I could, it was that good.With four different types of oysters we went for the raw variety. They were very high quality and my only complaint was that they came with the mignonette sauce already on there. I'd rather add that myself as after a few oysters the sweetness became a bit over-powering.The highlight for us in terms of entrees was the goat empanada. It was spiced perfectly. It was so good we tried to order another pair but they had, alas, run out. The pig face was interesting, but way overhyped. It wasn't what I was expecting. I was expecting a pig face I could wear out of the restaurant Hannibal Lecter style. That said, the pig face was tasty, just not as one customer leaving as we arrived put it, ""the best thing I've ever eaten."" In terms of the pig face, do try it, just keep your expectations grounded and you'll be happy. We also enjoyed the prawns. The salad was so-so and the escargot ravioli just didn't work for me. We ended the meal with a goat confit which came with lobster. This dish really highlighted the full flavor of the goat in a way the empanada does not. Probably not a dish for everybody, but we really enjoyed it.Girl and Goat seems to have adopted a more pretentious model for their bar. I'd wager their bartenders liken themselves Â mixologists (shouldn't you have to have a degree in a real science before you can add ""-ologist"" to your title?), and I'm sure they're all very friendly and only look down on you a little if your tastes aren't equally refined. My boo and I, however, are simple, salt of the earth people who enjoy a Jack Daniels or a Crown Royal. If your tastes are similarly inclined your needs will not be met and you will need to find a suitable, obscure, pricier alternative which will taste virtually identical to your preferred spirit of choice. I've been to my share of Michelin rated restaurants, and if you order a Jack Daniels or a Crown Royal they are brought to you with a smile. I'm more impressed by bars which offer a full selection than an obscure one.The service at Girl and Goat was top notch. We arrived slightly tardy for our reservation but barely waited a few minutes before we were sat. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and guided us through our options wonderfully. The timing of our dishes was also worked out perfectly. There was never a moment where there wasn't something on the table for us to eat, nor was there ever a moment where there was too much. All in all, top of the line on service.I didn't think Girl + Goat could live up to the three month wait expectations, but I'm happy I was wrong. If you have been hesitating on checking out Girl + Goat, just do it. Three months from now, you'll be glad you got to try it."
I wasn't super impressed but did have some good food there.
"My review won't add much that hasn't been covered a million times, but this place rocked. Everything from the exceptional service, to the fun atmosphere, to the amazing food topped off by the delicious ""pig's face"" was just outstanding. I can't wait to come back."
"Best items: Pig Face, Pork Shank, Goat Empinadas, Green Beans, Broccoli"
Worth the hype. Â Bonus: Â awesome beer list.
"Very pricey, but the food was great. We had friends in from out of town, and it was a great place to take them for dinner."
"Okay, yes, I'm another reviewer who followed Stephanie on Top Chef. Â From episode one, she was my girl, and I my roomie and I were so pumped when she won. Â We had been talking about hitting up her restaurant since the day it opened, and when I found out that I needed to come down this way for a work-related trip anyway, I asked my roomie if she would like to join me. She had had a crappy week and it was just what we both needed.We got to the restaurant a little before 6:00. Â No reservations were available (for the next two months!) but within five minutes of getting there a spot on the very comfy couch opened up. No problem! Throughout the evening we shared the couch/table with about five or six rotating couples who were popping in for cocktails or waiting on their reserved table to open up. Â Definitely get there early and getting a bar/couch spot shouldn't be a problem. We were there on a Friday night and we didn't observe anyone waiting all that long for a bar seat.The wait staff was very friendly, attentive and helpful. Â We started off by ordering a pair of old fashioneds, and they were the best we had ever had (even better than my previous favorite - the clove old fashioned at Uncommon Ground.) It was just so smooth and tasty.We ended up ordering 6 shared plates between the two of us - a great number that left us full but not stuffed.Plate 1: Blueberry bread with coffee butter. Â Delicious. The coffee flavor was very strong in the butter, and the strawberry dipping sauce was a nice touch.Plate 2: Fried muscles with egg salad and capers. Okay, neither of us are big muscles fans but Oh. My. Poseidon. We felt like we should be eating them in private, that's how good they were.Plate 3: Chickpea Fritters. The hype is right - these are crisp, fried and delicious with the smoothest, creamiest, most delightful centers. Unlike anything I've had before. I wanted to eat a whole trough of these. (the first three plates were staggered perfectly, but then there was a little wait and the last three plates piled up.)Plate 4: Pig Face. We had to do it! Of course, I had envisioned a whole pig head staring up at us, but it wasn't like that at all. The pork, the potato stix and the perfectly fried egg all combined into the most delicious dish of the meal (we both agreed it was our favorite). I'd give up five or six years of my life to be able to eat this for breakfast every morning.Plate 5: Goat Belly Confit with Crab and Lobster. Not much to say about this one - it was tasty, and the sauce was the star of the dish, but it was probably our least favorite dish of the evening (but still good!)Plate 6: Ham Frites. We were expecting something like a glorified horseshoe (yes, we're from Central Illinois), with a layer of meat under the fries. However, there was no meat, just the fries. Just the best fries we've ever tasted. Â It kind of tasted like potatoes and bacon had had a love child. The tomato aioli sauce and the cheddar beer sauce were both delicious compliments to the fries.SURPRISE 7th Plate: We HAD to have a dessert, and we are glad we did. We chose the bittersweet chocolate with shiitake gelato and toffee creme fraiche. We were both skeptical of the gelato (and it DID have a sublte mushroom taste) but it was an absurdly good dish. And thus, this became the day that I fought over the last bite of mushroom ice cream."
"What is there to say about Girl and the Goat that hasn't already been said? Â My wife first experienced Girl while in Chicago for a conference a couple weeks before we both returned for a wedding, and her plan was to take the L from O'Hare to our Logan Square hotel, ditch the bags, and go straight to the restaurant to stake out a spot in the bar for dinner.After the flight from Seattle followed by train and taxi rides, the wait for a table in the front of the bar was thankfully short, and we settled in for a culinary treat. Â We enjoyed some wine and perused the menu while commenting on how the music (playing at the perfect volume) could have been a playlist from our own music collection. Our waiter set a high bar for service for the rest of our weekend, serving as more of a consultant than mere waiter. Â Using my wife's previous experience and gluten avoidance, our collective likes and dislikes, and a good dose of encouragement, he helped us construct a varied and delicious meal:Over the course of dinner, we shared the goat carpaccio, chickpea fritters, pig face, goat chorizo flatbread, and finished up with the pork fat donuts. Â The only dish that wasn't wholly satisfying was the pig face, which we both found a little greasy, albeit tasty.After hearing my wife rave about it for two weeks, my expectations may have been set a little too high, and based purely on the food, I don't know that I'd go with a full five stars. Â But the service we experienced was among the best I can recall, and that was more than enough to push me over that line."
"This place is out of control AWESOME.We went out to celebrate our anniversary here. Â We got there early 4:30 pm sharp without a reservation (booked solid for at least one month) Â I can really understand why after such a phenomenal experience.From the minute we got there the host stand was extra courteous.They told us we would be seated in about 20 - 30 minutes. Â They checked on us ever 15 minutes to let us know the status. Â AWESOME in my book. Â We were promptly seated.To say the service was great is an understatement. Our server was extremely knowledgable. Â Recommendations from her hit the mark.We had the scallops, the octopus, green beans, the beef tongue, pork belly, goat empanadas and a few other dishes.Dessert was crazy good. Â The flavor combinations were amaing.Great food and great service made this a very special evening for us."
"Hi Fellow Yelpers,Because I love you all so much (even though I rarely actually read your reviews, except maybe to mock them), I'm going to let you in on a little secret about G&TG:If you have a small party, say, 2-4 people, you don't need to make a reservation. Â Just show up a little before 5 and you can put your name on the waiting list. Â You'll be seated between 6:30 and 7. Â If it worked for me Memorial Day weekend, it will work any time. Â Two other small notes:1. If your waitress gives you something ""on the house"", make sure to check your bill at the end. Â I'm sure it was just an innocent mistake that our complimentary green beans ended up on the check, but you may wanna check, just in case.2. Get the pig face. Â Duh."
"Can I give 10 stars? At least 6? Okay I guess 5 will have to do. We had a reservation on Sunday at 8:30 pm. We were seated on time and WOW we got lucky and got seated at the chef's table right in front of the kitchen. This was way too awesome for us, since my boyfriend is looking to work in the restaurant industry. He was mesmerized the whole time. We both were. I would like to remind everyone of how hard cooks work. Yes, the burns on their hands and arms are definitely an unavoidable part of the job, but their passion is the reason why we get to eat all this deliciousness.Anyway, the food. Here is what we ordered, and in the order we got them. -Oysters: so good and fresh! Great start to a great meal!-Goat Empanadas: this was recommended by one of the cooks. He said it was a nice way to start with the goat meat. The onion garnish was yummy!-Crudo: another fresh dish. The pork belly was a nice meaty touch.-Cauliflower: I hate cauliflower. So the cooks are obviously very skilled, because I loved this cauliflower. It was so good, and I watched the cook making it!!-Mushroom ragout: This was very earthy and flavorful.-Pig Face: I was very scared to try this.. I had no idea what pig face was like, but it was delicious! I expected it to be a bit salty like pork belly, but it was a bit sweet and creamy with the sauces and the egg. The pig face itself was crunchy and SO good. Dessert-Grapefruit Kulfi: WOW. It's like a custard/ice cream type of dessert. Another recommendation by a chef. The soft sour bits of grapefruit, the crunchy-looking-but-actually-melts-in-your-mouth lemon meringue, and the crunchy pistachios! Such a perfect combination. This meal was definitely the best on this trip. I've never had such a dining experience. Everything from the friendly server, to the awesome seats in front of such hardworking cooks, to the attentive busser. If you have a chance to go, then GO! Make sure you make reservations!"
"Hands down the best dining experience I have ever had. Reservations need to be made about 2 months in advance, but they are booked for a reason. I will be going back again ASAP! Try the pig face, you will not regret it!"
"Yeah Yeah Yeah...this restaurant has a lot of hype. Â And I often find that restaurants with a lot of hype don't live up to their expectations. Â But this is not one of those instances. Â This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, if not anywhere. Â No, this isn't a place to take people who have limited palates, enjoy traditional fare, and aren't in to trying new things. Â But if you are an adventurous eater, this place is for you. Â One of my favorite dishes by far is the Pig Face -- it is served with an egg on top and it is just delicious. Â The chickpea fritters Â and the Hiramisa Crudo are amazing. Â The menu changes frequently so even though I have been back several times, I have always ordered different items. Â Start your meal off with a sample of the artisan bread...fabulous way to get the ball rolling. Â And cocktails are terrific. Â For those of you pregnant ladies (or others who abstain from alcohol) the non-alcoholic ""pregnancy"" cocktail is fantastic (although I'm glad to be back to the real thing). Â Service has always been top notch and I agree with other posters that Stephanie Izard is an extremely gracious chef, willing to pose for pictures and certainly working hard to expedite service. If you want a real experience, sit at either of the two Chef's tables that face in to the kitchen. Â These really aren't tables -- rather, they are two high chairs (and no, not the baby kind) in front of the kitchen counter. Â Great way to enjoy the meal and get tips on what to order from all of the chefs in the kitchen. Â Girl and the Goat -- I can't wait for my next meal."
"We took my mom here for her birthday and she absolutely loved it! The waitress was charming and very helpful. She allowed us to mark up the menu so that the four of us could carefully make our selections. Everything was brought out at a nice pace from lightest to heaviest, or so it seemed. The highlights were the sauteed green beans(!), goat empanadas, mussels (I had never had mussels but figured this would be the best place to try them and I was right), shrimp with spaghetti squash, and if you are looking for a good bread to choose, get the squish squash. We were even offered a birthday dessert on the house, my mom requested something non-chocolatey and they brought out a delicious scoop of pumpkin ice cream with several tasty and seasonal toppings, a perfect last bite.As for the pig's face... I must admit I was wary, but due to the popularity in Yelp reviews, we decided we had to try it. One thing people do not mention is that it doesn't LOOK like a pig's face (snout and all, staring up at the ceiling as I had pictured). It's a bunch of incredibly tender pork with an egg on top, potato strings, and a delicious sauce. Even the least adventurous eater would enjoy this savory dish."
"Wow, this place is much larger than I anticipated. Â Neither good nor bad, just noteworthy.There were three of us dining on this Sunday night, and we ordered three plates each, plus two desserts. Â Every item was stellar. Â Our favorites were the roasted beets, the crispy pig face, and the grilled baby octopus. Â Lots of flavor to every dish. My sister even ate the octopus, and my sister doesn't DO octopus (or most sea creatures, for that matter). Â Funnily enough, nine of the 12 plates we ordered were non-meat items, and we weren't purposefully avoiding the meat dishes.Our server was super helpful and attentive, and it seemed the whole staff was pitching in to ensure everyone's meal went smoothly. Â The music was a bit loud, so everyone had to talk louder, kind of Catch-22 situation. Â But the ambiance wasn't so loud that we couldn't hear each other.My only critique would be the size of the table we were given. Â Considering I made our reservation nearly four months in advance, I would have thought we'd be given a booth. Â Instead, we were cramped into a half-booth type of seating. Â Fortunately the way the dishes are served, we never had too many plates on our table at one time. Â Also some of the items were a bit too pricey -- $24 for the pork shank, considering the size? Â Uh-uh. Â And naturally the price of the cocktails would break the bank.Would definitely return."
"Kindly put it all in my mouth. Thank you.Over Easter weekend, I visited Chicago in celebration of a close friend's 30th birthday. I called a month ahead for reservations and was surprised at how scarce availability was. We opted for Friday at 11:15PM. Â I knew it was a great choice based on Yelp reviews but it was even more awesome that Girl & The Goat was awarded Restaurant of the Year a few weeks prior to our visit. Im stoked! Hype it up even more! Unfortunately, there were major delays* with a number of our flights. Instead of arriving at 9PM, I got to O'Hare at 11PM. And so we missed our reservation and my heart broke into a million little pieces. Sadness.When our friend canceled our reservation, she was advised to walk in the following day for early dinner. And that's exactly what we did. We arrived at 5:30PM and were seated immediately. In less than half an hour, the entire space is filled. Glad we got in! Let the amazingness begin!Our group of six shared the following:- Hiramasa crudo with crispy pork belly, aji chili and cranberries- Roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers, toasted pine nuts and mint- Pan fried shishito peppers with parmesan, sesame and miso- Roasted beets with green beans, white anchovy and avocado creme fraiche- Seared tuna with veal sausage, grilled blueberries and pepitas- Goat confit with lobster, parsnip puree and shaved fennel- Grilled seppia with hazelnut, smoked tomato and bonito flakes- Braised beef tongue with masa, beef vinaigrette and salsa verde- Goat, pork and veal sugo pappardelle with rosemary and ground cherries- Wood oven roasted pig face with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro and potato stix- 2 bottles of wine- Cheese and crackers- Blood orange sorbet with parsnip pot de creme, pistachio cake and cornmeal crust- We were also mistakenly given 3 orders of oysters which they then offered as birthday gifts. HELL YES!All of the dishes had wonderful flavor combination with perfect balance. My least favorites were the braised tongue and shishito peppers not because they were not good. I've just had better. Â I fell in love with the crudo, goat confit and roasted beets. We all reveled how this dining experience counts as one of the best from Â taste and quality, service and price. Our server was oh so pleasant, gracious and helpful. We totally LOVED Girl and The Goat.Do yourself a favor when you go to Chicago, book a table. And book way ahead of time. It is worth every minute and every penny.*We were in the plane on the freakin' runway for 3 dreadful hours. I almost killed someone."
"I've been here twice, which already says something. The wait is worth it. The cocktails are great and so is the food! No matter what get the green beans."
"The decor is very warm and inviting. The waitress was lovely and the food was delicious . We Ordered the kohlrabi salad, definitely interesting mix of texture and flavor. the ham frites were delicious, great with beer."
"A must-try restaurant. The food is outstanding! My son and I and a friend ate here last month after I read reviews. The wait was long, but we actually decided to eat at the low tables in the bar area to sit faster. We tried about 10 things (plates are small, like tapas). Every single item was out of this world. The owner's story is really fun too (we heard it from the waiter). Absolutely go and check out this restaurant!!!"
"This place is amazing, and well worth scheduling your life 4 months in advance to accomodate a reservation. I was here last seriously a year and a half ago, and still gaze longingly out the window, dreaming of duck tongues. So good."
"I really thought I would be a fan and give them 5 stars, but I thought it was good/ok. As everyone knows, making reservations is a bitch. Thus..we had a 10:15pm reservation and were sat with little additional wait. The decor is cute and I love the woodiness of everything. The food was pretty good and there were a few items that were aiiitee. If it was food alone, I would have given the place 4 stars, but the service took it down a notch. As nice and knowledgeable as the staff was, I felt really rushed for the first 30 minutes of the meal. They were probably trying to rush us out since we had a 10:15 reservation..but that's not cool."
"Oh the Girl and the Goat...I am now officially on the bandwagon. I had been hesitant on even going there since there is such a long wait for reservations. I thought to myself...how good could this place be. Well it really was. Overall the meal was scrumptious! I did not give it five stars because I really did not like where our table was located. At the bar they have an area where people can stand and have their drinks and our table was right next to that. It felt like people were looming over our meal the entire time. Now on to the food! We started out with the bread special which was fresh and yummy especially with the beer cheese spread. Next time however, I would skip the bread so that I have more room for food. Faves of the night: Scallops: this dish had so many layers of flavor with the sweetness of the scallops and the smokiness of the brussel sprouts, tanginess of the tomatoes and the crunchiness of the pomegranates. Prawns: this dish was unexpected but once again it had so many layers of flavor that I could have licked the bowl! Green beans: one of the best of the nights..at first the thought was..how good can green beans really be but they were perfectly cooked and the sauce was delicious. Braised goat belly w/lobster: this was from the specials list but it was so tender and buttery that I am still thinking about it the next morning. Good but there were better: Goat Chorizo Flat bread: This dish was good but compared to the other dishes it did not punch me with flavor. i thought the chorizo flavor would come through more. Pigs Face: I know I know..everyone is raving about this one and it was very tasty but just stated like eggs and bacon which I did not feel went with the rest of the meal. To end the night I had the Chocolate Bouchon which was like S'more's on steroids. I am already thinking about my next trip back."
"When you say stuff like PIG FACE, I get excited. Â I'm thinking YES! A plate with a face! Â This dish had no nostrils, no ears, no eyeballs, so kind of a misnomer. Â But pretty tasty. Â Best dishes - roasted beet salad and the goat empanadas.The ""WTH"" dishes - the octopus and sea bass. Â The seafood chef must have giant paws bc his pinches of salt were just too much.Service and casual ambiance were just fine."
"Must say this is one of the very best American cuisine restaurants I have EVER been to! I can honestly say that because not only were each and every dish precisely seasoned and delicious, the timing of each dish was fitting, the service was impeccable, and the ambiance really set the right mood. We tried a little of every 'category' from the beets (love, love, love beets), to the Green beans... Can't forget the gietost.. Or some sort of goat cheese baked bread... But it was absolutely scrumptious!! And I don't even like goat cheese!And on to the scallops and Pig face... The meat was sweet and savory, with just the right amount of spices. The drinks were also Very thirst-quenching!"
"This place is to die for! My boyfriend and I were visiting from San Francisco this past week and a local recommended The Girl and the Goat to him. We walked in sans reservations--pretty risky for a Saturday night, but there were no bookings available. We were quoted a two hour wait time...but were lucky enough to walk up to the bar just as two people were leaving. The service was fantastic. Immediately after being seated, we were greeted by one of the bartenders. At no point were we ever looking around trying to flag down our server.Everything was delicious. We had the pan fried shiseido peppers, hiramasa crudo with crisp pork belly, grilled baby octopus and the seared scallops with smoked goat. The flavors in all of the dishes were incredible. Our favorites were the hiramasa crudo and the grilled baby octopus.We finished the meal off with the chocolate bouchon with foie fluff, Â salted toffee, milk chocolate sorbet Â and gooseberry compote. AMAZING. The coffee and cocktails were also wonderful. What a fabulous meal to remember Chicago by."
Mmmmm...crispy pork shank = big bone-in crispy chunk of meat = good. Â Read all the other reviews if you are looking for a culinary synopsis on the cohesion of flavors from the dishes. Â I've already written all I that I needed to and will definitely come again next time I am back in Chicago.
How can you not like this place !! I love the pork shank!! Everything we try is great! The only downside is the reservation ... Be prepared to wait for a month or more to get a day and time you want . Price is fair for what they serve .
"You met my expectations Girl and the Goat!I made reservations online roughly 5 months ago - I wanted to see if all the hype about this restaurant was true. Â The first reservation available was at 4:45pm - whoa...early bird special! Â I didn't eat all day so I could live it up in the evening.First, the restaurant itself is quite large and can seat a good amount of people. Â The vibe inside the restaurant was great - it had an upscale rustic feel to it - I loved it.Our waitress was amazing - super helpful for us when it came to ordering. Â We took some of her suggestions and made some of our own decisions as well.Between the two of us we had the following:Green Beans - I loved these - they are covered in a fish sauce or oil of some sort with cashews- they definitely lived up to the hype! Â Everything was flavorful with a little crunch - amazing.Chickpea Fritters - This was different than what I expected but still great nonetheless - the fritters are served on a bed of veggies which are incredible! Â Overall though, I would probably not order these again - the oils in it were a little heavy for my stomach.Mussels - HOLY GOODNESS - their mussles are brought in from out West in CA and they are AMAZING - SO SO good and the croutons and broth which are in the dish are to die for as well - I LOVED the Mussels!!Oysters with horseradish - these were busting with all sorts of flavors - I really enjoyed them however the horseradish flavor was kind of missing or hidden so if you REALLy love horseradish- maybe request if they can somehow add more or something.Goat Belly - the goat belly was so incredibly tender - it almost melted in your mouth - I loved it and would def recommend it.Our final dish was Â pork rib (I can't remember) it was some sort of rib and it was also really good but I don't recall too much about it because I was so full by this point.I was stuffed to the max - we had 6 dishes between the two of us - I think it was a little too much but we were just so excited we couldn't help it.Although I was full to my head - of course I had to order dessert and coffee before saying good-bye.We had a very rich chocolate cake dessert - it was very rich and the bottom was covered in passion fruit. Â It was really only ""ok"" Â It didn't blow me away or leave me wishing there was more. Â The coffee was REALLY good though.Finally, our bill arrived - and I have to say, I was pleasantly surprised with the total cost. Â Was it expensive - it was - but it wasn't through the roof, I can't believe we ever spent that much money on dinner - expensive. Â It was all worth it.Overall - I would say it lives up to its expectations of being amazing. Â The experience in itself would get most people excited. Â Different types of foods that you may not normally eat - it's a great experience and every dish is seriously busting with flavors. Â It all leaves you with a great conversation, if anything - what was in that? I LOVED that spice...what was that extra kick to it? Â My husband and I spent a good portion of our dinner discussing each entree because they were so good.All this being said, I would say, give it a try for the sake of trying it but it's not the kind of restaurant that leaves me with cravings saying, ""oh I would REALLY love Girl and the Goat tonight."" but it will leave you telling friends and family, they MUST check it out because it's an overall great experience with food."
"Luckily I was able to make a reservation at 10:45pm on a Sunday while in town at the newly James Beard nominated Best New Restaurant. Â I've heard it's pretty much impossible to get a good reservation time unless you book at least a month in advance. Â Crazy.Girl & the Goat is more about the small plates, similar to tapas, like many new casual American restaurants nowadays. Â The menu is separated into 3 sections, vegetables, seafood, and meat. Â After diving right into the menu, we ended up with 7 dishes, hoping that it was enough for the 4 of us:+ Roasted cauliflower - with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. Â I love the refreshing flavors and the only other place where I've had better cauliflower is at the Lazy Ox Canteen in LA.+ Chickpeas Fritters - romesco, hazelnut hummus, sesame aioli, and goat feta. Â Hazelnut hummus was awesome! Â The romesco sauce has a little kick to it.+ Hiramasa Crudo - with crisp pork belly, aji aioli, caperberries - hiramasa is a type of yellowtail and the dish is essentially a sashimi dish with small pieces of crispy pork belly sprinkled on top.+ Ham Frittes - with smoked tomato aioli, cheese sauce, and smoked swiss. Â Thinly cut fries with fine fine bacon/ham sprinkled through it like it was salt? Â Yes!+ Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, and fried potato stix - most interesting dish of the night! Â The sauce was oddly addictive and I love it when the yolk breaks and runs down.+ Goat carpaccio - with tongue-olive vinaigrette and smoked roe. Â Off the special menu. Â Was expecting some gaminess but surprised none at all.+ Crisp calamari - with rabbit ravioli, spring onions, and red watercress. Â It also had an aioli over it but forgot.Overall, my favorite was the ham frittes, just because I love the flavors of it. Â It's salty and smoky that I just can't stop eating it. Â Comes in a huge basket as well! Â The sauces were a nice touch but I found that for the majority of the time, I was just enjoying the porky goodness of the dish.One thing though was that a lot of the dishes were super salty. Â Besides the ham frittes, which I can understand since it's fries, but some got to me a little bit. Â A lot of the plates also had some sort of aioli. Â Tasty, sure, but it got a little too mayo-y in the end for us. Â That's why the pig face was such a refreshing dish for us since the sauce it totally different.Definitely aim for 2 plates/dishes per person though, since the portions are quite small. Â The plates are pricey so do expect the bill to go up pretty high. Â Drinks-wise, there's a good wine selection, as well as beers. Â I went with an old-fashioned while the others went with an Allagash. Â Old-fashioned was definitely made right.Service was great and our server came to check on us constantly. Â There's also other staff going around refilling water all the time, which is super important since Girl & the Goat uses a lot of salt. Â Even though we stayed till well past their operating hours, they never tried to kick us out. Â In fact, we even got a glimpse of all the cooks joking around.Besides the heavy use of salt and the dependence on aioli on many dishes, I still like this place. Â There's some interesting combinations and the space is beautifully designed. Â I especially like the dark wood accents throughout! Â Just be sure to make a reservation early so you don't have to starve yourself until dinner because of a late time slot :P"
"I had heard some hype, and remembered Stephanie Izard from TopChef... so this was definitely on my list, whenever I managed to get to Chicago. Â In town this week for a conference, I was quickly designated the group's resident foodie - and asked to make choices about where to eat for a very diverse group of tastes. Â But everyone from the vegan to the ""I don't eat out much"" absolutely fell in love with Girl and the Goat. Â Walking in at 8, sans reservations for a party of 5, I gritted my teeth and expected the worst... but the incredibly friendly host staff were rockstars and got us down within 5 minutes. Â Our server was friendly and accessible, walked us through the menu, and made sure we were happy and well-informed.The menu was equally accessible, and showcased some foods that I knew would take some cajoling to sell my dining partners on. Â But with a couple of these and a few of those, I made sure there was plenty for everyone. Â From sweetbreads to short ribs, edamame to squash ravioli, there was nary a bite left on the table when we were through. Â And every dish managed to rank when we each listed our ""top 2"". Â We shared a dessert, had a few glasses of wine, and just soaked it all up. Â This place is not to be missed by anyone who wants an adventurous meal, prepared by a creative chef, in a funky environment. Â First time to Chicago? Â Long-time resident? Â It doesn't matter. Â Take the $5 cab ride to the West Loop, and check out Girl and the Goat... there's no way you'll regret it. Â I'll definitely be back on my next trip to town."
"There was nothing wrong with the food, yet none of the 10 dishes that we had were exceptional enough to warrant 5 stars"
"it would be easy to get caught up in the euphoria about G&G and yes the food was very good but not so great that I would go all in at a five. Â We went as a group of 4 last night having scored researvations at 9:00 pm. Â The bread (we tried the wheat bread w/bacon butter and bloody mary Â bread w/maple olive) and wine, ordered were really good so our anticipation was on the eager side. Â But about half out of the 10+ dishes we ordered were just anhh. The best was the broccoli, the mussels, the mushroom ragout and wagu beef tartare. Â Pig face made of pork jowl bacon hash browns and eggs was simple and good but, like others I don't see it as a star to hang on, also we really liked the chidkpea fritters. Â Less impressive was the goat meat empanadas, confit goat belly and goat carpaccio. Â The shishito peppers came close but were oily and a little bland. The scallops were a combination of burnt (not seared) and raw but if not for that, the sauce was really good. Â Finally the remelluri was forgetable. Â Maybe it was just the post holiday dulldroms in the kitchen, so we will try Â again as half our group said it was not nearly as good as the last time they were there. Â The service was excellent, lots of staff, always full water glasses and they quickly cleaned off dirty Â plates. The bill for four of us with one bottle of good wine and no desert was $330 including tip."
"This was by far the worst service I've had at this level of venue. Â We didn't have reservations but didn't mind waiting - we had wine at the bar. Â My friend, who used to waitress, made a remark to me that after an hour, three 4-person tables at the front were still available. Â Tony, the manager, turned to her and snapped that there was a reason they were empty. Â Unnecessary to join our conversation, no doubt, but absolutely appalling to speak to a customer like that. Â They seated us at 6:30 and said the table was reserved for 8:00. Â We said no problem - no way should we need more than an hour-and-a-half to eat. Â The waitress said to order everything at once, and she'd parcel it out for us. Â We waited a half hour for a our salad, then another half hour for our bread. Â Then 3 dishes came out at once. Â We asked the waitress to hold the final 2 for a bit. Â A couple of minutes later they were both on our table. Â I looked at my watch and realized it was because it was 8:15. Â We asked the waitress to speak with the manager. Â Tony's assistant manager, Megan, came over and told us we'd have to move to the bar. Â We said that for a $250 dinner, we were finishing it. Â It wasn't our problem that the dishes were mistimed. Â She said - and I couldn't even make this up - ""whatever"" and walked away.This is such a shame since the food was amazing. Â Unfortunately, though, there are plenty of other restaurants with amazing food in Chicago with good service. Â It's fine to try once, but it's not worth revisiting."
"I was here for my birthday, this this was by far - and I'm in culinary school and I've eaten at a lot of great places - THE BEST MEAL I'VE EVER HAD. Everything that I put in my mouth was mind-blowing. I was so impressed with the food, the service, and the drinks that I wished I lived in Chicago so I could work here. This was the best birthday meal ever, and I'll have to go back for my next one because this couldn't be topped. :-)"
"I consider myself lucky to get a reservation for our girl's weekend in Chicago. Â It happens to be one of my dearest friends favorite, and we were celebrating some great accomplishments. Service was amazing and the food was incredible. Â My favorite was the pork belly, I had to refrain from licking the plate. We also had the chickpea fritters, which were so delicate and yummy. The combinations of flavors were like no other. What an enjoyable experience."
"For the life of me, I can't understand why this place is so highly rated. I found it to be a huge disappointment.I came here for a friend's birthday. This place is WAY overpriced and WAY over hyped. First off, we had made a reservation almost 5 weeks in advance asking for a quieter table off to the side, and still got stuck standing and waiting for nearly an hour. Then when we finally got our table it was horrible and probably the loudest table of all, right by the door. In addition, our waitress was HORRIBLE!!! She kept pushing us to order a certain amount of dishes...it came to the point where I had to say out loud to my friends right in front of her ""we can order as much or as little as we want...we don't *have* to order X amount of dishes."" She was so pushy that it soured the experience right off the bat. As for the food, we had about 9 different dishes, and there were only three I would recommend. At least three were SO salty that everyone at my table found the dish unappealing. The chickpea fritters, Ahi tuna, and Sugo were the only dishes I would recommend. The cauliflower was nothing special, the octopus was very tough (you can get octopus 100 times better in Greektown at the Parthenon), the Walter's chicken was nothing to write home about - especially for the astronomical price. All in all I'd say save your money and go elsewhere. Hype does not equal great food. There are many better places to spend your money on a wonderful meal."
"GETTING MY GOAT ON I generally avoid super popular places like Girl & the Goat, because with all the excellent dining options in the city I see no need to wait more than 15 minutes for a table. But, with a guest in town I decided to give it a shot on a Tuesday night at 7:30. The wait? An hour. But in the corner of my eye I spotted two choice seats at the bar that I immediately pounced on. Score! HIGHLIGHTS: -Shishito peppers with miso and Parmesan cheese; an umami revelation -Scallops with brown butter XO; best dish of the night -Confit goat belly with lobster and crab; the least goaty goat I've ever had; I guess I like goat now. -Rhubarb and lemon gelato dessert with graham cracker; perfect, refreshing end to the meal, made me want to start cooking with rhubarb The only dish I wasn't crazy about was their signature dish, the oven roasted pig face with egg. I'm glad I tried it, but it was too fatty and rich(and this is coming from someone who has used foie gras as a dipping sauce for frites)."
"One of the most incredible foodie adventures that my husband and I have ever experienced! Hands down, one of my top 3 restaurants. The mussels and pork shank are delicious! Excellent, personalized service, great atmosphere, and stellar fare. A Chicago must try!"
"Girl and the Goat was every much as an epicurean delight as most everyone has mentioned. Â I will just say that every food item was phenomenal, from it's ingenuity of blending ingredients to it's freshness. Â My husband and I started with the Hiramasa crudo, a yellow fin tuna delight. Â Melt in your mouth, with a very light and delicate sauce - aji chili and crisp porkbelly. Â  Next we had the kohlrabi salad, which again, was a home run - kolhrabi sliced thin, fennel, evalon (a goat cheese), toasted almonds, lush, juicy blueberries and a ginger dressing. Yum. Â Following the Goat chorizo flatbread came out and it was like one of those delicious pizzas we recently ate in Turkey, only WAY better. Â The most outstanding thing about this was the amazing sauce. Â It tasted of red, green and a spicy pepper, with each being distinct but not overpowering!! Â Our next treat was the squash blossom rangoon. Â If you have anything, have this. Â Wonderful. Â Tender, filled with a cheesy, crabby mix, perfectly temperaed with a blend of two amazing sauces. Â Finally we had the Smoked goat rilette empanadas. Â They were perfect. Â The empanada was perfectly cooked but the filling, of course was the star!Finally, was dessert. Yes folks, Girl and the Goat has my vote for the best dessert I have ever eaten, and boy have I had a lot of desserts. Â I am a confessed chocoholic. Â I had Stephanie's Bittersweet Chocolate Cake, Shiitake Gelato and Toffee Crunch Creme Fraise. Â I just want to go back and eat that everyday. Â It was moist, it was deep, rich, lush, chocolately and out of this world. Â Girl and the Goat was definitely worth the 3 month wait! Â Innovative and delish.The wait staff was Excellent!!! Highly recommended."
"Again, difficult to get a reservation, but we managed to get in for a party of 5 on a Saturday night with much advanced planning. As soon as you step in the place.... scratch that, as soon as you step near the restaurant, you'll know why this place is so hard to get a reservation for. The sweet smokey smell that is the essence of girl and the goat emanates from the restaurant covering an entire city block making anyone in the near vicinity crave its contents.Such great food in a casual, non-pretentious setting; impossible you say? Well... girl and the goat will prove you wrong every time. Being a small dish type of restaurant, the best part of it all is the ability to sample a great variety of dishes with your group.Service: quick and attentive. The waiting staff and the busing staff makes it a point to get your dirty dishes out of your way as soon as they are soiled so the various flavors of their delectable dishes don't get in the way of each other. Water was replenished like a waterfall, and the dishes came out almost one after another. The recap of what each dish entails as they come out is a great way to help one remember ""wait, which one of the 11 dishes we ordered is this one again?"".Food: Amazing.1) Razor clams: I love razorclams, and these are no exeption. Sour and fresh with a tint of smokiness.2) Hiramasa Crudo: the combination of crispy pork belly, crudo, and adornments make this dish one of my favorites here. A definite MUST ORDER if it's your first visit and well... everytime you dine here.3) Roasted cauliflower: a great intermission to the seafood dishes that preceded it.4) Soft shelled crab: crispy, creamy, crabby, what's not to love.5) Grilled sepia: as our waitress told us ""I really like this dish, it is sooo smokey"", well, she was right. The sepia was really smokey, and if that's your cup of tea (definitely mine), then you'll love this dish.6) Baby Octopus: not my favorite, but then again, this is girl and the goat, it was more outdone by all the other great dishes that preceded and followed it. As a standalone dish most other places, it would be great.7) Greenbeans: again, another very nice break from all the seafood, crispy greenbeans with amazing adornments.8) Beef tongue: tender and flavorful as tongue tends to be, flavored wonderfully.9) Pig Face: another favorite of mine. The egg on top definitely adds a nice element of flavor and texture to it. The crispy noodles on the bottom along with the sauce that it comes with together makes this an amazing dish all around.10) Goat chorizo flatbread: crispy flatbread with goat chorizo, that's all.11) Goat belly: this was on the daily specials menu, and it was creamy and fatty, perfect ending to the meal.One of the best meals I could imagine, girl and the goat will make any evening a great one."
"The excitement for Girl and the Goat had been building for a few months. Â I, not being Chicago, was visiting with the bf over Memorial Day Weekend. Â We lucked out and had made reservations here 2 months prior, almost immediately after booking our flights to ChiTown. Â After hearing about the various national awards that they've been receiving (including some James Beard love), I was counting down the days until we ate here.The restaurant seems to be in a pretty rando area (a few blocks off the Hapro Studios). Â We had reservations for 4:30 so had an early dinner. The menu, off the bat, was very ""different."" Â I'll admit that I'm not adventurous when it comes to eating certain animals (i.e. goat, rabbit) but we decided that I had to try a few dishes since we were there. Â True to their name, G&G has a section of their menu dedicated to goat dishes. Â We got the goat belly, which tasted good but I couldn't get the mental block out of my mind enough to enjoy the meal. Â We also got the calmari with rabbit ravioli, but again I couldn't fully appreciate the dish :(Definitely loved the pig face- WOW. Â It's hard to explain what it is about that dish, but it all came together beautifully and it works so well. Â get it.Also loved the shitake gelato with chocolate cake/brownies and toffee. Â I've never had shitake gelato but wow that was a hit of umame & sweet at the same time. Â I would definitely order that again as well.The prices are reasonable and we walked out of there feeling like we got what we paid for. Â Love that it is tapas style, to share."
"I can understand the hype with the celebrity chef and all....Our overall experience was good. there were some amazing dishes  * scallops, pig face, hamachiand some not so good* baby octopus - too salty* beet bread - crust way too hard* chicken - bland* thai chili chocolate ice cream - not a big fan, burns my throatWe will probably be back but I don't think I want to wait 3 mos. for a reservation again"
"The most delicious meal of our trip to Chicago. We got lucky, reservations were full on a Monday night but we headed down at 9 with the expectation that we'd wait an hour for a bar table. Â Ten minutes later we had a beautiful table. The food and the flavors are phenomenal. A foodies dream. We discussed every dish with awe. I will be talking about this one for a long long time."
"Almost everything was delicious (oh so close!). Â The dishes that were delicious were very on point and made me melt, a few others seemed a little off.The specialty drinks here are very good."
"RESERVATIONS ARE A MUST!! Heard this place was a must go! As we arrived the hostess told my friend and I we would have to wait an hour and 30 minutes so we did it was only 7 at the time. After almost 2 hours, they told us that they had a table for us now but that they would need it by 10. I was upset because I have never had a restaurant tell me they would need the table at a certain time after waiting 2 hours. We were rushed but the food was great. The sautÃ©ed greens beans were amazing roasted pig face and escargot raviolis were also a great choice, it was an explosion of flavor with every bite!"
"Second time at Girl and The Goat! Another great experience - the restaurant does not disappoint. I was sad that they did not have Mersegueera/Malvasia/Viognier, Mestis Blanco 2011 Valencia (a favorite of mine!). Â But we tried the Gruner which was pretty good as well. Â Got the pork shoulder (delicious!), bread (great!), shishito peppers, crudo with bacon (dish is disappointingly small but surprisingly great, big taste!). Great service and lively atmosphere. Â The three of us ordered 6 plates and 1 dessert - MORE than enough, I'd recommend going a little less than that."
"This is why Yelp has 5 stars. In a word this place is heaven. I'm embarrassed to write this but I'm smelling my shirt right now. Hell, I'll admit it. My shirt smells amazing. Like a cross between a camp fire and a Texas barbecue. I'm planning on bottling my shirt up just so I can smell it when I come home tomorrow night. You think I'm joking? Girl & the Goat is everything a restaurant should be. Fair prices and amazing food combined to provide one of the best dinners of my life. It was simply divine. We started off with two bread appetizers; one 3 day aged sourdough and the other stuffed with beets. The butter served with is whipped and warmed so it spreads and melts upon contact with anything warm. Both were fantastic. Rather than bore you with details I'll share my favorites of the night after having tried 16 different items. The calamari and rabbit ravioli, the escargot, and the pig face were my favorites. But every dish was better than the next. In case I go missing over the next few weeks, send the search party here. I'll be the crazy one in the corner, hunched over and smelling my shirt while stuffing my mouth with pig face. Girl & the Goat defines a 5-star review. I will be back...and often."
"Everything I ordered was good. Â  I was impressed that I even was delighted with the green beans. Â  The sauce and nuts that they prepared them with really made them tasty. Â I've been coming here since they opened. Â Some menu items are out of the ordinary and I won't try. Â  Â  Be aware that this place gets quite busy, and you can opt to eat at bar if you don't mind."
"Lives up to the hype!!!If you're able to go and there are only 2 of you it is a must that you request the chef's table...no extra cost...they have 2 tables for 2 set at the kitchen window...crazy experience to watch all of the dishes prepared before we ate them and to interact with the staff...Allison, Raul, and Michelle were super cool and engaged us while they worked the entire night...what set Girl and the Goat apart, for us, was Stephanie Izard...she was expediting then we watched her go table to table greeting folks around 9pm...we've been to Bottega and Morimoto multiple times, and even though I'm sure those chefs do the same, we've never seen them...we later found out that Stephanie opened Little Goat at 7am...even more impressive! Hope she keeps her roots!My wife and I ate dinner there 5/10/13...As far as the food goes, here's what we ordered:Kampachi Crudo: the best thing we've eaten in awhile....both of us loved it... Never had a caper berry before but they were delicious...the Meyer lemon added to the dish sent it out of the park!Goat Empanadas: had higher expectations for this one but it came up just a little short...maybe we aren't goat connoisseurs or maybe the first dish set the bar incredibly high...whatever the case, these were good, not great...cream cheese mixed with the ramesco was a nice balanceGreen Beans: another solid dish...fish sauce vinaigrette was out of bounds good... I think they even sell it next door at Little GoatEscargot Ravioli: never seen this on a menu before so we had to try it...my wife can't stand snails but even this dish turned her into a believer...deliciously cooked buttery snail wrapped in perfectly cooked pasta...can't go wrong with this onePig Face: we've heard all the hype about this dish and it lived up to it...a tad on the rich/sweet side but that would be me being super picky....I'm not even going to do it justice by describing it...if you're there and it's available, order it and thank me laterDessert Sampler: they were kind enough to put all 4 of heir desserts on a platter for us to sample and they were the perfect ending to the meal...my wife absolutely loved the date cake with blueberries"
"The place is good, but not up to my expectations.It's an art of food type of place. Pretty cheap for that type of place, but with a huge downside - long wait. Personally for me it's next to impossible to plan a dinner 6 months in advance. My friends did it for me, which I'm very thankful for.Because of all the hype around this place I was expecting to try unique tasting food. Since it was 4 of us, we had a chance to try 11 different items. The food was pretty tasteful, but nothing that would explain the long wait. Nothing truly unique, nothing exceptionally delicious either.Additionally, I usually try special cocktails in places like that. Out of several recommended ones nothing impressed me. You're better off with Caipirinha.The place is crowded, which is fine with me, while may bother some.The conclusion is 4 out of 5 and not recommended for those seeking new flavors."
"Stephanie Izard, you can cook me animal face and organs anytime!Everything's served small plate, so don't expect to get out of Girl and the Goat for ""cheap."" Â That being said, I thought the prices were very reasonable. Â For 2 people: Â dinner + dessert + drinks = about $200 with tip. V.(+) roasted cauliflower . pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint Â ::: Â wow. yum. Â I never imagined cauliflower could taste so delicious. Â Absolute recommend.M.(+) braised beef tongue . masa . beef vinaigrette . salsa verde. ::: Â I kissed a cow and I liked it? Â I mean, I liked eating it's tongue. Â Wait, that didn't sound right either... how ever you say it, this will be the best tongue you've ever tasted.(+) skewered lamb heart . spiced black mission figs . charred tomatoes Â ::: Â I'll break a poor little lamb's heart any day if it means Stephanie gets to cook it for me later.(+) wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix. Â ::: This little piggy's face went straight into my mouth and I enjoyed every bite.(+) confit goat belly . bourbon butter . lobster n' crab . fennel. Â ::: Â Belly, get in my belly. Â Yes, again another fantastic dish.D.(+) pork fat doughnuts . honey yogurt . carmelized figs . lemony eggplant . ham streusel. Â ::: Â Pretty sure this isn't at all healthy for anyone, but I ate it and like it. Â While good, I would have rather gorged myself on more meat or cauliflower. Â But, then again, I'm not really a dessert person.Lisa our waitress and all the food runners were the bomb. Â Everyone's so friendly and helpful, I love this place. Â I just wish it didn't require reservations so far in advance.I'll sneak in again."
"I come here about every 2-3 months, since I have a group of friends that LOVE this place. Â This is a great place to go if you have a group of friends who like trying unique, interesting, and flavorful dishes. Â In a group of 8-10, we usually order all or most of the veggie dishes (I'm vegetarian), as well as few meat dishes. Â That way, we're able to have a bite of everything and get a taste of as many of the dishes as possible. Â Everything's always delicious! Â I have yet to have a veggie dish I didn't like from there, and I've never heard any of my friends say anything bad about their meat dishes! Â My favorites include the Chickpea Fritters, Shishito Peppers, Roasted Cauliflower, and Kohlrabi salad. Â Favorites among my meat-eating friends include the Diver Scallops, Ham Frites, and Pig Face. Â We also always get 2-3 of their breads, which are usually pretty unique, as well as a dessert or two to share for the table. Â I have never been disappointed in anything I've tried here!In terms of service, I've found the waitstaff to be super attentive and friendly. Â Our water glasses drinks are never empty since they are so attentive. Â I was here just last Thursday for my birthday, and not only did they come out with our dessert singing, but they also gave us 2 other complimentary desserts for the table! Â A+ service!"
"I've been here twice now, and the food is definitely delicious but unfortunately the service was not great either time. Â The first time, my date and I were disappointed by the generally inattentive service but I noticed that our server was also serving a large party and having been a waitress I know how stressful that can be. Â However, last week I came back and was disappointed again. Â I am a pescatarian and my friend and I ordered all fish and veggie dishes except one meat dish. Â Without even asking, our server made it a point to assure us he would bring a couple of the dishes out together so that I would not be stuck awkwardly watching my friend eat his meat dish. Â We also pointed out my friend's onion allergy and he assured us that nothing we had ordered had onions. However, one of the dishes arrived overflowing with onions, and the meat dish arrived at least 15 minutes after we had been served the rest of our food.I'm not sure if it was the server's fault or just the way the restaurant is organized, but it seemed like we were served by a number of people and nobody was checking in on us to make sure our meal flowed well or that we were having a good experience."
Loved this place as expected. Â The only thing I can say is that you shouldn't order everyhing at once. Â The portions are a lot bigger than they look in Yelp pics so you should pace yourself. Â Excellent food!
"First off, I saved Girl and the Goat for my 300th review. Yay!Secondly, G + G was one of the best food experiences I've had in Chicago, if not THE best. Wow. I am seriously impressed. A res for this place is highly recommended. Waits for walk-ins are long. It was hard to believe it was so packed on a Monday night. I started off with a Tingly Tongue beer, which was nice. It's a darker beer with some interesting flavors. My husband and I were seated and we started off with the Lobster bread. It was bread with remoulade and lobster butter. LOBSTER BUTTER. Yeah. I said it. It was so good. So, so good.We ordered the following. Chickpeas fritters . romesco . hazelnut hummus . sesame . goat feta - Surprisingly light, a nice kick, cheesy. Kabocha squash ravioli . mushroom raisin ragout . brussels leaves . shroom creme fraiche - So many flavors going on here, it was hard to explain. It was savory and sweet and delicious. Wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix - Husband loved it - compared it to bacon/egg with syrup on top. Halibut with greens, blackberries, asparagus and a salty cod sauce - Best halibut I've ever had. Wow. So many flavors going on here, but all working together. Goat heart - Husband loved it, I didn't have it.The last two aren't on the website so I can't say verbatim what was in them. Ok, first off, everything was outstanding. I can't emphasize that enough. My favorite was probably the halibut (I'm a sucker for that) and my husband's favorite was the ravioli. I also ordered another cocktail called ""Best of Three"" - Pimms, Vodka, Cucumber and Mint. Loved it. So refreshing. For dessert we got this rhubarb/lemon concoction in a mason jar. It was shortbread with buttermilk panna cotta and a lemon panna cotta with rhubarb. Wow. Blew my fucking face off. It was extremely unique and delicious. I will add that the amount of food we ordered was completely obscene for 2 people.... next time I'd probably cut back on one plate. I was full to the point of explosion by the end of the meal. Yes, it's pricey, yes, it's hard to get a table, but totally worth it. This place is pure win."
"Friday, August 27th at 4:30pm was the only available time for 2 but we walked right in, seated at the cold kitchen bar (only seats two) and immediately was greeted by our server Brenin. Â He's full of personality and very descriptive about each dish, not a salesperson or too pushy. Â He was fun and energetic. Â He made sure he timed all the dished, we never waited for anything. Â Chef Stephanie was there running her kitchen. Â The food was super delicious and not pretentious. Â It's tapas but you can easily order 4-8 things for two people, that is if you're hungry. Â The mixed cocktails are yummy and refreshing. Â The decor is warm, rustic and represents...I know you're probably thinking, 4:30pm, what are we 60yrs? Â Nope, it just worked out that way..."
"Had an excellent time at Girl and the Goat last night. Even though they're booked up with reservations for a month plus, we were able to walk in and eat at the lounge. The atmosphere was so social, we had lovely conversations with other patrons while dining on the best meal I've had in months. The breads are gorgeous and the pork was out of this world. The whole evening was topped off by incredible service. Mandi was such an amazing waitress. She's alway in the lounge... so go make a visit. Cheers!"
"Over the past 4 days, I have been to a few restaurants while here in Chicago. Â This by far was the best meal we had and overall best experience culinarily speaking of course.The wife and I had the following:The scallop dish, the goat belly special, the baked east bench oysters and the PIG FACE! Â Yes, it sounds gross, but the PIG FACE was the best thing I have eaten all year. Â It's like breakfast for dinner or lunch or even breakfast. Â Get to this restaurant and try this dish. Â Looking forward to this place again on my next visit to Chicago."
"When the first question the waiter asks you is ""any preservations?"", you gotta admit, this is especial service. The minute I said ""yes, garlic"" he Sid let me go talk to the chef and brought back another menu, crossed out the ones I couldn't have and the ones I could have with special substitutions. I mean AMAZING service. The best I've ever had, independent of the price. Pros:Great food, the beef tongue is to kill for.5 star service, the best.good value for the money you payCons:Need to make reservation in advance, we were told a month.They don't make reservations for parties of more than 12, we had to reserve for 2 separate groups and they couldn't even sit us together or even close.I definitely will come back the next time we visit Chicago and order the beef tongue again, if they still have it on the menu.Just a heads up, they don't accept reservations for groups of more than 12, or at least that's what we were told!"
"This restaurant has incredibly great service and food, even given the fact that it is mobbed be ginormous amounts of patrons. Â Girl & the Goat doesn't take rezzies, so I put my name in for a party of three last night at 6p. Â The very pleasant hostess said it would be 90 minutes to two hours. Â My friends and I decided we would stalk people in the lounge area (which has a bunch of sofa/coffee-table seating as well) who looked like they might be finishing up. Â We ended up having dinner in there, which was fun and communal since the people sitting around us were very cool. Â (""Hey, what is that you're eating? Â It's good? Â Waiter, we'll take one of those too please!!!)So, onto the food -- really, really flavorful and creative. Â (I'm sort of a food snob, but in a weird way; e.g., I was very bored by French Laundry -- wow, classic French in a really stuffy environment -- ho hum, yawn.) Â Stephanie Izard kicks Thomas Keller's ass in terms of being inventive while creating delicious concoctions, as opposed to being fancy yet uninspired. Â Especially delightful were: Â *wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix (pork cheeks and yummy stuff)*roasted cauliflower . pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint (all three of us loved this dish)*hiramasa crudo. crisp pork belly. aji chili. caperberries (a light, pretty dish that was also very tasty)(There's also a squash blossom dish we ordered that i couldn't find to copy off their web site for y'all, but as I recall, it was stuffed with crab and possibly goat cheese. Â That was also incredibly good.)The service in the bar area was excellent - very friendly and authentic (told us what they really liked, didn't just say ""everything is good here""), and they were pretty easy on the eyes too. Â Just sayin'! Â Ultimately, very, very enjoyable. Â This will be a staple stop when I'm in Chicago. Â Well done!"
What a disappointment!! Â We waited almost 6 months to get a reservation only to be rushed through the entire meal - our waiter even had the nerve to tell us he needed to turn our table. Â I felt like I went to a diner with fine dining prices.Not worth the hype
"I thought Girl and the Goat was quite simply put, delicious. That goat! *swoon* Seven pounds of glorious wood oven roasted goat shank. It is brought out to your table hip bone and all along side some very tasty accompaniments - naan, hard boiled eggs, crispy onions, creme fraiche and a few different sauces. My fav combo was a nice mound of that succulent goat a top a piece of naan drizzled with shallot & garlic mayo and finished with a slice of hard boiled egg & onions. Di-vine. You must have a party of at least six to get the goat and it must be ordered in advance. Do not mull this over and think about it - just order it. Our server recommended that we order heavy on vegetarian dishes since ya know...we we're getting 7 lbs of goat. We laughed at her and ordered the beef tongue. Ok, that is not entirely true...but we did get an order of the beef tongue and it totally changed my opinion of this meat that I really didn't enjoy so much on another occasion. Our table also ordered the signature green beans, cauliflower gratin, squash ravioli, shishito peppers and roasted beets. My two fav dishes were the tongue and the cauliflower...although the shishito peppers were quite addictive. We impressively finished all 7 lbs of the goat...so we decided it was only fitting to round out our gluttony with dessert. One of each? Yes, please! We don't need to look at the dessert menu, just bring us all of them. Four desserts and all were quite good but my favs were the pork fat donuts and the bittersweet chocolate with shitake gelato & toffee creme fraiche. The flavors really worked and if I were alone I probably would have licked the bowl. GATG was a true treat indeed. It was a wonderful evening filled with good conversation and fantastic food. The service was on par with what is to be expected with a place like this. It does get a little loud but that will soon be forgotten once you start tearing into the goat like a bunch of mad barbarians."
I'll keep this short and sweet-GOOD BUT NOT GREAT. Try it. But definitely not as good as the hype surrounding it.Way too much salt on everything. Good food shouldn't need a ton of salt.And you don't have to wait 4 months for a reservation- just walk right in. We walked in with no reservation on a Friday night at about 9 pm. We were told it was a 2 hour wait. No problem. We sat at the bar and had a few drinks and aps. 45 minutes later we had a table. Oh yeah- and you may have to share a table with other people. Great if you feel like making small talk with strangers. Not so great if you're not in the mood.
"I've been here 5 times since they opened. Â I always enjoy the food and have tried almost everything on the menus. Â I will say that the seafood is my favorite. Â Some of the dishes have gotten really ""rich""...almost too much. Â I wish they would put a few less super savory dishes on the menu but other than that you can't go wrong!The food is so good that I need to say something unexpected...expect to wait, even if you have a reservation...expect your clothes and hair to smell like smoke and grease and expect to use unisex bathrooms because no one pay attention to the letters on the door. Â  Â I hear Stephanie is opening a burger joint on the same stretch..."
"I have bought into the hype of Girl and the Goat. Yes, the place is trendy, yes it is filled with skinny beautiful people, yes the vegetarian options are limited (there are many hidden seafood items in their ""vegetable"" section), yes the dessert is small and a tad odd (ala shitake gelato). But I love it anyway!My chickpea fritters were out of this world good, their selection of breads had me begging for more, and the service was impeccable. Any place that keeps my water Â I will go back just to order those chickpea fritters again. As far as the suggestion of 2-3 plates per person, that is only applicable if you are very hungry. I have left satisfied from 1 1/2 plates. I must restate- do not let the presence of the skinny beautiful people turn you away from a wonderful dining experience. You will not leave hungry, nor will you leave with an empty wallet- a lighter wallet, but not an empty one!P.S. Their gelato comes from Black Dog gelato- yay for supporting small Chicago businesses."
"We had a reservation for 8PM, but they were unable to seat us till about 8:30. Â They did, however, provide our table of 6 a free round of drinks and a couple orders of plates. Â Overall, I highly recommend it at least once, but definitely not a routine place to go."
"Not all it's cracked up to be. It is fun, I will give it that. I gave a few tries but now I'm over it and prob not going back anytime soon."
"the food really is mother freakin good.the service is even mother reach around freakin betterthe ambience is freakin motherin comfortingthe stephanie is one hot momma shut yo mouth chef with the friendliest mojo.nice place to take your favorite food sharing people as the more dishes you get, the bigger prize you win. ::smiles::yes, smiles is the prize./apologies for such really bad writing. otra vez """" """" """" """" """" """" (::quotation marks to place where you seem fit::)"
"The BEST meal of our four day stint in Chi-Town EASILY goes to The Girl and the Goat.*sigh of relief*I'm SOOO glad it lived up to the it's reputation. Â Go Steph! Â (I Heart Top Chef) She knows her way around the kitchen. We couldn't score reservations but arrived shortly after they opened. Â There was about a 45 min wait for a table but we opted to not wait and sit in their communal lounge area. Â It was a good call for us as the service was great and the people around us was super friendly. Â Yay to Chicago!Positives:EVERYTHING was delicious... and each getting more and more decadent. Â (Read: Leave your diet at the door). Â My favorite was the Chickpea Fritters; my husband's was the Scallops, and my friend totally dug the critically acclaimed Pigface. Â We also got the refreshing Roasted Beets, a interesting Loompa Bread with lovely jam and butter, and the Goat Belly. Â I can't say a bad thing about a single one of them. Â There were a lot of Ooohs and Ahhhs and an occasional groan around us. Â I think the consensus was that everyone was pleased.Cons:The distance from California. Â =("
"Lucked out with no reservation and was able to get in for a party of two with only a half hour wait! Bustling atmosphere. Waiter was helpful. We sampled the following: beet salad, goat belly, beef tongue, and pig face. Bill was about $100 for 2 people. Would return again!"
"I had to try the pig face. Was I expecting to be served the face itself? Naively, yeah. But it really is a blend of the pig face parts molded into a patty. An earthy aftertaste. Am glad I tried it, but definitely won't return for it.Out of 9 dishes (2 desserts included), our selections (goat empanades, olive bread, hanger steak -- I'm still hungering for it, octopus, bittersweet chocolate cake, fried doughnuts, green beans, chickpea fritters) were mostly stellar. Good blend of ingredients although in the green beans, the lime juice was a tad effusive. Most of the flavors are a homage to Asia, with use of yuzu, masala, noc cham, tamarind, lime.Our server, Tony, is as amazing as the rest of the staff. Water glass and plates were filled and cleared so efficiently you would think they hired phantoms for that job.In a nutshell:-- Well hyped (Top Chef winner and all)-- Party of 4, 2 well-selected beers, 9 dishes $118-- Noisy. Wish there were dampeners to absorb the noise level. Convo is difficult without much leaning in or lip-reading.-- A vege lover's paradise. Perfectly prepared and plentiful-- Worth a return"
"The portion sizes could be smaller, which is forgiveable if the quality is high. Â While the quality of the ingredients is unquestionable, the end result is little more than the sum of its parts (ie no interesting nonlinearity observed)"
"This was my second visit to Girl & and the Goat. The last time I had gone was two years ago with friends I was showing around during their visit in Chicago. The second time around was just as good as the first. My boyfriend and I came to the restaurant for our last dinner in Chicago and as soon as we came into the restaurant we were seated immediately. Our server was prompt and attentive, providing us with suggestions on some of his personal favorites and gave us concise descriptions of the day's specials. We first started with The Onion which came with two warm onion brioche muffins with two dipping sauces: ancient red pepper chutney and tarragon butter. The bread was soft, fluffy and super flavorful. I kept breaking it into small chunks so I could savor every bite. The butter was creamy and the taste of the tarragon wasn't too overwhelming. The chutney was a mixture of sweet Â and was a great contrast to the saltiness of the bread. From there we ordered three other dishes from each section of the menu. The restaurant divides their dishes into three categories: vegetable, fish and meat. From the vegetable section we ordered the chickpea fritter with eggplant caponata, green chickpeas and mozzarella. From the fish section we ordered the tempura soft shell crab with sweet corn elote and harissa aioli. Last, we ordered the braised beef tongue with masa, beef vinagrette and salsa verde. The chickpea fritter was nice and crispy and not soggy. It went well with the eggplant and the other vegetables on the plate. The crab was also great and the sweet corn flavor helped cut some of the saltiness from the marinade and batter covering the crab. The braised beef tongue was tender and the salsa verde helped to add even more flavor to the beef. To finish, for dessert we ordered the sweet corn and peaches severed with brown butter gelato (from black dog gelato) and spiced caramel corn. We enjoyed the gelato so much we were looking up on our phones where black dog gelato was located. Our sever saw us yelping and gave us some of his own recommendations on where to go to the city for dessert, which was nice of him to do so as we were visiting from out of town. My experience at Girl &and the Goat was just as great as the last and I'm glad I got to eat here on my last night in the city!"
"Short: Â We ate dinner at Girl & the Goat tonight and thoroughly enjoyed our experience.Long: Â So it was the wife's birthday and she wanted to try G&TG pretty bad. Â We went for a 4:45PM seating, which brought forth several humorous emails from our friends who are still stuck in the 8-is-cool and 4:45 is for senior citizens. Â Nonetheless we showed up and made use of the $10 valet parking. Â We went inside and were pleased to see that the restaurant was a third full so clearly we weren't the only ones taking advantage of the early bird special.We were seated and each ordered a cocktail. Â I had a Dark and Stormy which I liked a lot. Â My wife had a Best of Three which was refreshing and reminded me a bit of a Mojito.We then ordered the Culture Club bread, which came with beer cheese sauce. Â Very nice. Â The bread was this great sourdough with cool holes in it... even the bread was special!We then had the roasted oyster appetizer, which was very tasty.We ordered a lot of food and had:Crudo: Â Great, portion is smallScallops: Great, one of our favoritesChickpea Fritter: Â Solid, but not a standoutSugo: Â Very very nice.Escargo Ravioli: Â Really great, would recommend alsoBeef Tongue: Â Us dudes like it, but both of us are more adventurous.... Too liver-esque for the ladies.Green Beans: Â Very nice as said by othersHam Frittes: Â These are fries, you get a lot, this should be selectedPig Face: Â Very tasty, would reccomend, not a big portionDonut desert: Â The donut had a slight salty taste and pared with the ice cream almost had a peanuty flavor.. nice. Â 2 donut holes FYI.Also ordered half bottle of Long Shadows Riesling and a full bottle of Mauritson Zinfandel. Â The zin was peppery and my buddy picked it... I would look at the affordable Malbecs they had before the Zin.My suggestions:ScallopsEscargot RavioliGreen BeansHam FrittesSugoNot:Crudo: Â While I liked the Crudo the small portion scared me and as a first plate it made me think I'd have to get a burrito on the way home.Chickpea Fritter: Â Nice portion, small flavor.Beef Tongue: Â Probably only the foodies who like liver and sweetbreads like me should have this.Pig Face: Â I did like it, small portion if you care, a wee bit over-hyped but still very nice.Our meal total which included 4 cocktails, 1/2 bottle of that Riesling, and a full bottle of that Zin came to $318.00. Â Our server, our guide really, was Jody and she was awesome. Â This UofC'er enjoyed talking to her, and she was very knowledgeable not only with the entrees but very conversant with the wines.Totally worth it. Â We like to eat at places like this once a quarter, and we were more than satisfied with our experience. Â On the way home we got deserts and coffee at Sweet Mandy B''s, sat in the park, and counted the stars (okay the airplane lights you got me).Bon appetit!"
"As we are huge fans of Top Chef America, Deb, my Girlfriend and I went to Girl and a Goat for our fourth anniversary of our first date, since Chef Stephanie Izzard won four seasons ago. Â It is a very hip place with excellent food. Â  Every bite we took was a mouth full of flavor! Â  We got there early so we could wet our whistles at the bar, and let me tell you the Bartender was quite the talent for drinks and conversation, even though she was very busy! Â The wait staff was extremely attentive and the buss service was as polite as it was efficient! Â As good as the food and service was, I cannot say we would be regulars there because the food a very heavy and felt like we had to be rolled out of there! Â Many would say that's a good thing!"
A haiku:Is it possibleto eat here without postinga status update?
Came here with a party of 8 and got seated near the kitchen at a large wood table. Â The atmosphere is great and the table and seats were comfortable (unlike Publican). Â The server was great at suggesting dishes and how many dishes we should order for our party size. Â The fried oysters were fantastic and brussels sprouts were AMAZING. Â Pig face was good but honestly nothing I would order again. Â The shank was great and the portion was pretty substantial. Â Total cost (no alcohol) was about $45 a person which I think is great for a great night out in Chicago.
"I think GATG is one of the best restaurants in Chicago. Â Went to the popular Publican a week later and I couldn't stop comparing it to GATG. Â Hard to get reservations though!Highlight: their green bean dish. My friends and I weren't polite about this one. Â We were fighting for the last bite. Everyone on yelp seems to agree.Very enthusiastic and friendly waiter who knew the menu well.The food was outstanding. Â Interesting, creative, comfort food! Â  Very cool decor. Â Well worth the $$$$ because it was a fun eating experience. Â Every bite was a surprise! I can't wait to come back here."
"The food was terrific as was the atmosphere. Â In particular, the Veal Shank was to die for. Â It is difficult to get a reservation, but they do accept walk in's nightly. Â My group of 2 waited 1.5 hours, but the folks at the bar were very welcoming and helpful in finding us a ledge to have some apps while we waited. Â Highly recoomend."
Finally had the opportunity to try the Girl & the Goat have to say it was pretty good. Â We tried the secca. Fresh bread from a bakery across the street w/ garlic butter. Â The Â  Â green peas & cauliflower where great with a lot of flavor.... Lamb ribs and pig face where different but good... Service was attentive .... Cant wait to go back & try more of the menu
Pretty good food......loved the roasted cauliflower.It was fun to try all the little plates but sometimes you feel like it's hard to build a meal with this format....especially if this is your first visit.The space is beautiful and the wait staff were first-rate.Will return for more
"So there's a lot of hype surrounding this restaurant, and it didn't quite live up to that in my mind. Â Granted there are some factors that could have led to that, but I wasn't necessarily ""wow""ed.First off, the reservation took 2 months to get, which is fine, it just built anticipation. Â Then, 1/3 of our party of 3 was an hour late...and while that's definitely her fault and not fair to the restaurant, their reaction to it was a bit unfair. Â The other 2 of us weren't allowed to sit down until our 3rd got there, and by then they had given away our table, so we had to wait some more. Â I understand they're crowded and need to seat other people, but we would have ordered an appetizer or something, and instead we were just grumpy.The good thing was the service once we sat down. Â Our waitress was very nice and good about explaining any dishes we were curious about, especially in regards to dietary concerns (I keep kosher-style). Â She recommended a couple things to us when we weren't sure what to get, and they were pretty tasty.Dishes ordered:Lamb tartar- pretty good, but nothing amazingShishito peppers- REALLY good Green Beans- also REALLY good, definitely get these!Squish squash bread- really liked the cheese spread that came with it, but the apple/pear spread I could have done withoutChickpea fritters- kind of tasted like fried squares of hummus, and they were good, but nothing to rave aboutClam Linguine- my friends ordered and since I didn't eat it I can't attest to itCalamari- same as aboveThis was just the right amount of food for the 3 of us, and we all left extremely stuffed. Â The prices were better than we initially expected, with a total bill of about $80 for the 3 of us. Â The decor is pleasant enough, and the attire is definitely a range from casual to business. Â It's pretty good gourmet food, but because of the limiting menu for myself, not a place I would probably frequent too often."
"The food here was amazing. We ordered 7 dishes between 2 people and demolished everything. Our waiter patiently answered any questions we had about the menu. The food we tried were interesting and delicious, thoughtful and exciting. Of course we tried the pig face which was at once crispy and tender. The braised beef tongue was flavorful, and incorporated many different textures. I could go on and on. Everything we ordered was unique and at the same time, homey and approachable.My favorite dish of the night was the parsnip pot de creme with blood orange sorbet. It was recommended to us by our waiter. To be honest, I hesitated to order dessert because I was already full enough to explode, but I knew I made the right decision immediately after my first bite. The pot de creme was creamy, but also light and refreshing. Reservations are hard to get, but the Girl and the Goat is definitely worth the wait and effort."
"Worst Dining Experience in a long time - Ruined my 10 year Anniversary!The experience was bad enough that this is the first time I have written a yelp review.I live in SF and eat at world class restaurants on a regular basis. I love Chicago, but they have a long way to go on learning customer service.Food was relatively good, but wait staff and especially host staff made the experience horrible. We had an 8:00 reservation and were thankfully seated promptly, that's where it went down hill.This restaurant is more about turning tables than providing a memorable dining experience. The waitress introduced the menu and suggested we order 4 to 5 items and she would pace the courses for us. Not sure what that pace was, but it was as if we were at a Portillo's drive through and we were being asked to pull forward to the next window. We could not keep up with the lightening pace at which the food came out (and we eat fast). As we struggled to keep up the next course the food piled up and got cold. Our meal was literally 3/4 over within 35 minutes of sitting down. I have had longer and more romantic meals at Chili's when I was sixteen. If it were up to restaurant they would of had us out of there within 45 minutes.That's when it went really south. As we finished our meal we were brought the dessert menu. Instead of dessert we chose to enjoy our 1/2 glasses of wine that remained. As we sat waiting to tell the waitress our decision the host staff started to hover like a vulture over a dead carcass. Impatient the hostess decided to approach us about ordering dessert, at which point we declined. No quicker than declining the hostess presented us with the bill. I was noticeably irritated, but chose not to say anything (no need to make a scene on my 10 year anniversary). Instead I just politely moved the bill to the empty chair next to me until we were ready to pay it. The vultures still swarming noticed this and approached apologetically stating that they were not trying to rush us out. Funny, cause I never said they were, but it was very clear by her actions and response they were caught in the act and they wanted us out of the table despite us trying to enjoy our remaining wine.Now if this was TGI Fridays I get that move, but a restaurant like Girl & The Goat, total amateur hour.BTW, turn down the music!"
"So I can't say anything about this place being overhyped, as I live in NY and haven't heard the hype. What I can say is that we waited over an hour to sit at the bar (granted it was a Saturday night). I was fine with it; when we walked in I was digging the decor and I thought the drinks were spot on. The bartenders (our servers) were awesome, so kudos for that. I have issue with the food though. The food was too over-reliant on smoked meat and salt, which seemed to overpower almost every dish. I love me some bacon like the next man, but I walked out of the restaurant feeling like I just took a sauna in a smoker. I will say that there were a couple dishes I really enjoyed, including the pig face and the calamari/wax beans. Those two were excellent. I liked the escargot ravioli as well, but by the time it came out- a 15 minute lag at the end of the meal- I was done with the richness of the meal, and this was the richest dish of the evening. Overall, too heavy-handed with rich, smoky and salt flavors. This may appeal more to a Midwest crowd but for my subtle NYC palate I'd prefer a lighter hand when it came to these elements. My meal was good, but could've been a lot better. I would go back, but next time I'd order a lot more lighter vegetable dishes to account for the richness of the meat dishes."
"Terrific concept, we had trouble getting a reservation for the longest time!. The wine lsit & craft cocktails were terrific. Service was uber good as well. Lots of pig to be digested, give it a try nest time you are in Chicago's West Loop. Not to filling, and can be expensive but hey it is only money."
"This seems to be the new trend... industrial design and tapas plates. Not to mention the acoustic oh GOD I had to scream the whole time I was there even after the crowd died down. Food here was unfortunately very underwhelming -- nothing really jumped out and everything seems to be missing ""something"" taste-wise. I have experienced better places in LA like Animal or Gjelina... This place failed to impress me, and service was pretty bad too. I had to massage my neck and shoulders at times waiting for the next course and our server. I think our dinner took like 3 hours it was horrible. And then of course we were ""pressured"" to tip.. urp."
"A couple months after making my 10 PM Friday night reservation, my wife and I finally got a table at the Girl and the Goat!It was worth the wait and I am definitely going to try to make it back here. Â The oven roasted pig face was probably my favorite dish, it was simple but so perfectly cooked and seasoned. Â Another highlight was a bowl of green peppers with some kind of cream sauce, again very simple but so rich and flavorful. Â We got the sorbet to top it off, which was a perfect end to an extremely rich seven courses. Â I could go on with each dish, but I don't really know how to describe the taste other than really, really, good.The place is crowded and lively but the tables are spaced apart enough to provide an intimate experience. Â The service was excellent, I like how the dishes are server in twos and the timing actually ended up perfectly. Â Overall, it lived up to the hype and I want to go back as soon as possible."
Eat the pig cheek here. Your welcome! Â Place is worth all the hype.
"I'm disappointed to report only a three-star here. I really wanted to love this restaurant, but based on my experiences at other Top Chef restaurants like Mike Isabella's Graffiato in D.C. and Paul Qui's Uchiko in Austin, I just couldn't put Stephanie Izard's Girl & Goat up there with the other two restaurants. So my boyfriend and I managed to snag a reservation about three weeks or so before Â at 10:45 PM on a Wednesday night. Not ideal, but I'll take it (never mind that the kitchen closes in 15 minutes...). We got there right at 10:45, and the place was still PACKED. Let me divvy the rest of this post up into sections:SERVICE-Excellent. One of the best things about this restaurant was the service! The server was friendly and well-versed on the menu items, taking care to explain how the menu was divided up into veggies, fish, and meat. He also made sure never to rush us, despite the fact that we were well past the time the restaurant was supposed to stay open until. FOOD- As we had seen on Yelp reviews and as the server explained, this place is small-plate style, so for two people, we should order between 4-6. We opted for 5 since we wanted to try as many things as possible. We ordered the following: (1) sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews, (2) tempura soft shell crab with lump crab coconut broth, thai chili aioli, and sugar snap peas, (3) ham frites with smoked tomato aioli and cheddar beer sauce, (4) wood oven roasted pig face with a sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro, maple, and potato stix, and (5) goat belly with lobster and crab. We also got a double barrel drink (bourbon), and 4 in the same, which was Grey Goose + green chartreuse. The drinks were pretty good - strong and semi-expensive ($13 I believe for each drink). My drink, the 4 in the same, was extremely unique because of the green chartreuse taste - it was refreshing and had a slight plant taste due to the green chartreuse. The tempura soft shell crab and ham frites came out first. The soft shell crab was my second favorite out of all that we ordered because it had just the right amount of crisp on it. The broth was delicious - the coconut was extremely light and hard to detect, so never fear if you're not a coconut lover. The ham frites were also delicious, but pretty overwhelming as one of the first things to eat. Essentially, they taste like they were cooked in bacon oil...so extremely greasy. The smoked tomato aioli was the perfect complement, whereas the cheddar beer sauce was just extraneous. It didn't do anything for us, and the taste of the cheddar beer sauce just kind of blended in with the ham frites. While good, the ham frites were a lot to eat and I wish the chef had done small portions of different types of fries, instead of a huge basket of the ham frites as it was a little too much for my tummy to handle.Next, the goat belly came out. The lobster and crab were so fresh and delicious and made this my favorite out of all the plates we ordered. I would definitely recommend trying the goat belly - it tastes pretty similar to pork belly, so don't let the weird description scare you off! Finally, the pig face and sauteed green beans came out at the same time. The sauteed green beans, while good, were not incredibly new to me as they tasted like a not-as-good version of Chinese green beans. The onions in the green beans made the plate a bit too salty, but overall it was fine. The pig face, when mixed together properly (not a fan of sunny side eggs by itself), was also delicious. Again, nothing to die for, but good. At the end of the day, I think most of the menu items aren't very innovative, which makes me disappointed. Everything we had was good, but not amazing, mouthwatering, can't-live-without-it kind of stuff. The last thing I think they could improve upon is the pacing of the food. I wish that they had come out with the green beans first as it's just a teeeeny bit lighter than the ham frites (said with sarcasm dripping). Ham frites would have been great as the last thing, as they were more a ""side"" kind of dish anyway. Our total bill came out to around $100 pre-tip, FYI. ATMOSPHERE-Overall, very busy and posh, filled with yuppies and some families. Dim lighting. The tables were pretty close together. Not to the point of irritation, but I could definitely overhear the conversation at the two tables next to me without trying to eavesdrop. One caveat to my review is that both my boyfriend and I were semi-full before going, so we weren't in the best mindsets to be trying a ton of food. I think we would have had a better experience had we gone in hungrier, but I still think at the end of the day, this would only be a three-star. Worth trying once because it's a Top Chef restaurant, but not worth going again because of the price and difficulty in snagging a reservation, especially in a place like Chicago, where good food is so easy to find."
Was very impressed by the place. Lots interesting items on the menu that you will not find anywhere else. Not too expensive either. Just make sure you make your reservation months in advance.
"After a 2 month wait, my culinary dreams came true. I had not been this excited to go to a restaurant since XOCO opened (seriously), and it's not just because of the Top Chef hype. Walking past this place just makes you salivate - I just had to try it, but I was patient enough to wait.I managed to get a reservation for 4 on a Sunday. I made the reservation even before I knew who was going to come with me. With that said, the company you bring is almost as important as the food you are going to eat. I was very fortunate to find people willing to fine dine with me on this fateful night.Even though we were early for our reservation, we were greeted and seated immediately. The hostess was very friendly, and our server was knowledgeable. The menu - oh, my goodness, the menu - everything I had been hearing about and read just came to life on those sheets of paper. What we digested (not in any particular order):-oysters-goat empanadas-shishito peppers-chickpea fritters-seared tuna-the green beans-crisp calamari with rabbit ravioli-ham frites-ribs-cauliflower-hanger steak-pork fat donuts-pig face-an amazing blueberry dessert dish that tasted like cheesecake but wasn'tStandouts:-goat empanadas-shishito peppers-fried calamari with rabbit ravioli-cauliflower-pig face-hanger steak-ribs-pork fat donutsEven though the ribs were a bit salty, the flavor was great. The fried calamari was probably my personal favorite dish - the calamari was fresh, and the rabbit ravioli was a definite surprise. The ravioli was cooked well, and the calamari was crisp but not too crisp. Most of the dishes were very hearty and flavorful, but the beans and the pig face had very simple, straightforward tastes. The ham frites were okay, but were maybe too simple and too fatty. The dipping sauces, however, were amazing. The cauliflower had mint and pine nuts in it, and I think it had the most flavor out of everything we ordered - every time you bit into the dish, you discovered a new flavor!The pig face melted in your mouth. Absolutely stunning. The goat empanadas were a good surprise - I've never had goat before (let alone rabbit), and the meat was really juicy and the flavors were there. Â It's fun to taste everything and guess what ingredients are in it. I don't mind an attack on the taste buds, because I feel like being creative with food is just a whole other game that I could never compete in the food business. Respect the food, respect the chef. As for dessert, I highly recommend the pork fat donuts. I mean, come on. They are filled with chocolate ganache and come with blackberries and malted vanilla ice cream. Yeah. I know. You just went straight to food heaven right there.The service was great, the space is excellent, the bathrooms are nice, and this place was packed. The overall experience was great, which made the food taste even better. We had so much fun tasting every dish, and 2 dishes per person is definitely more than enough. The dishes aren't huge, but they're not your average small plates, either. Go with a friend or two. You'll have a great time!"
"I've never given 5 starts in my reviews so far, but this place is an experience. The food is great but the creativity and artfulness makes this so much more."
"I hate to be the odd ball (actually I don't mind that, being the odd ball is fun in general! I more dislike that I didn't like this place much. Or perhaps was just too engulfed in the hype). Went a couple months ago with another couple, we had made reservations for 10pm, but we happened to get there early by about an hour. We asked if we could get in early, even by 20 min, but they said there's probably no chance at all, that the wait was longer than the time it would take for our reservation time to come around. That was a big bummer, that they couldn't squeeze us in, but knowing the popularity of this restaurant, what can you do...So we sat at the bar. 4 people, 2 chairs, crowded bar, 1+ hour. Had some drinks, they were fine, nothing spectacular. We asked for the bartenders to make something spicy not on the menu. They kindly (but not overly happily) obliged. The drink they gave us was fine. Nothing that sticks out in my memory...Finally we got to our table and were starving. Everyone else at my table was vegetarian except for me, so we got 5 veg dishes, and one meat dish for myself. Of the veg I know we got the cauliflower, olives, some peanut butter special, beets and maybe 1-2 others. I was really excited about the cauliflower, but was really disappointed. In the end, it just tasted burned. The beets were too sour, most of the table didn't like. Olives were just olives... As my meat dish I had whatever the waiter recommended as I wanted the best/most popular meat item, and preferred goat both because I like it and the namesake of the restaurant. I think he told me the empanadas. They were fine, but I've had ones in hole-in-the-wall restaurants that were just as good, if not better. All in all, for the price, I was not impressed. And especially seeing that we were sooo hungry, and about 4 drinks in, I feel like I would have eaten anything and enjoyed it. Maybe theirother meat dishes are better, but from what I saw, I wouldn't go back for those prices. Nothing bad, but I just don't think it lived up to the hype.(Sidenote, server was nice and patient with us, and the decor is dark, very wood-y, it's fine, nice and clean. Oh, but bathrooms were downstairs, again 4 drinks in, full bladder and boots... not the easiest task...)"
"Best and most unique food I've had in Chicago. I'm not sure which plate was my favorite but as the waitress mentioned its ""not a competition!"" Every plate was unique and delicious, with very generous portions (surprising to me)! Our waitress was more like our friend and consultant as she carefully explained everything on the menu in extreme detail. Girl & the Goat definitely has their act together. Strictly greatness.Go early or late and snag a table - reservations are way too crazy."
"From beginning to end this place achieves one of the best flavors in each plate you can taste in a restaurant. All what I had: drinks, entres, vegetables, meat, dessert had the perfect combination of spices, temperature and textures. I had the goat carpaccio, the green beans and the squash blossoms and each of them blew me away. I ended up with the goat cheese dessert and I can't describe how good it was. The drinks I had (a Syrah and a unusual dessert wine) were excellent pairings. I just want to be there again!"
"This review is going to be colored somewhat by a non-standard experience. Â Which is to say that we managed to score a reservation to this extremely popular restaurant during our visit to Chicago, and when we arrived, we were led to the back. Â To two seats pulled up next to the pass, in front of the cold station, right in front of all the action.I have no idea how this happened. Â But I'm not going to complain. Â It was one of the most awesome food experiences we had on a week-long trip filled with awesome food experiences.There are plenty of reviews detailing the dishes. Â We had quite a few of them, and we saw many more prepared. Â We even got a taste of a dish or two that we had not ordered when we asked the cooks about what we saw them working on.To make a long story short, we got to talk with several of the cooks, got to see many of our dishes prepared in front of us, and got to watch an awesome show all night as dishes went out. Â We were not expecting this. Â It might happen to you, you never know.Of course, the restaurant is famous for some slightly exotic things like pig face, lamb hearts with sweetbreads, and goat carpaccio ( all very good ). Â Their chickpea fritters are unbelievably light and airy. Â The bread is actually something special, and worth what they charge for it.I'd also be remiss if I did not mention that their cocktail program is pretty darn decent.They heavily suggested their green beans, which in my book were just okay. Â Pretty much everything was a little savory, a little heavy, but it is that sort of place. Â Service was friendly, the cooks were friendlier, and it was just a great, relaxed experience overall."
"We are not from Chicago, and stupid us, did not have reservations. Â Doors open at 4:30 pm. Â Hence, we arrived at 4:00 pm, and was second in line. Â It was surprising to see how half the restaurant is empty, yet the bar was full beyond capacity. Â Foodwise, we ordered several dishes to try between four people. Â Everything was pretty good.Chickpea Fritters - These were some of the best Fritters I've had. Â I recommend.Escargot Ravioli - Escargot should stick w/ garlic and butter, and ravioli should continue to be ravioli. This was not a good dish. Â I do not recommend.Ham Frittes - So so good. Â Tasty, crunchy yet soft. Â I really recommendPig Face - this was a very unusual dish. Â It's a pig's face underneath an egg. Â I wasn't a big fan, but the couple who dined with us LOVED it. Â My boyfriend thought it was okay. Â So majority rules, they recommend. Aside from these dishes, we had several others. Â They were all pretty good. Â The only downside with TG&TG is the saltiness. Â However, I feel like all of Chicago is salty (at least where we ate). Â But yes, definitely get reservations and try it!!!"
Worth the 3 month advanced reservation. Â That is all.
This place is awesome. Not one bad dish. Â Went here for a birthday Â How can you not like this place. Â The wait for reservations was well worth it. Â She does vegetarian extremely well. Some of the meat dishes we delicious as well. Â Can't complain beyond 5 stars!
"I have been here multiple times and can say that I have yet to be disappointed by the food. Be sure to order multiple plates and share, it works a lot easier that way and allows you to try new things."
"I have to start out by saying I don't think this place lives up to the hype. Â Just my personal opinion as my husband thought it was awesome. Â I just think when it comes to a place that takes months to get into and is the talk of the city, I expect service and food to be top notch.While the food items I picked were good, i just thought it wasn't totally wasn't worth it. Â I've been making my rounds to all the high end trendy restaurants and this is on the bottom of that list. Â The plus/minus was the service. Â They were very slow to bring out the dishes we ordered and came to take our dessert order before our last two dishes came out. Â On the plus side, they did very generously comp us those two dishes plus dessert.What I will say, is they do have a very unique menu, if you are looking to eat pig face and duck tongue you have came to the right place. Â To again be totally honest, you could not pay me to eat those dishes and maybe that's what you should order here, as my husband did he loved this place and I stuck to the safe items such as skate wing and the vegetarian dishes.Overall this restaurant was good and I enjoyed my meal but there are other restaurants I would pick first."
"The food is great. But our server was so terrible and I've heard a similar story from a few friends that it's prevented me from going back. Our server was awkward, didn't get one of our orders correctly, and kept pushing and trying to sell us more wine. It ruined the experience. Overall, there are many other restaurants I would try before going back."
"Great food and drinks! Â I started with a veracruz, i don't remember what was in it but i liked it so much i ended up having another. Â I tried some oysters, which were ok, lamb ribs which were super tender and tasty, then wood roasted pig face which was super crispy ans good. Â Met my expectations in every way, but i did not manage to see Chef Stephanie, bummer."
"Oh Girl and the Goat, where do I start? Came here for the once in a lifetime Superbowl Brunch! Â Ordered about 7 things off the menu (one of them twice!) and they were all great. Â Let's begin shall we?Corned Beef hash - the corned beef was cut thicker than normal and the flavor was immense, mmm great with a poached fried egg! Â (is that possible? yes, yes it is.)Potato home fries with masala, caper vinaigrette - You can't go wrong with fried potatoes and two dipping sauces, the masala was my favorite.Roasted pig face with fried egg, cilantro, etc - Okay I have to admit, I've never had pig face, it was tender and the taste was good but I couldn't finish it. Â I'm one of those people who can eat anything as long as I don't know what it is. Â I really wanted to like the pig face but I couldn't get the image of a pig head out of my mind...Walter's wings - If you know me, you know I go to wings every Tuesday (not lately) and order everything BUT wings so to those from the Tuesday crew, I actually ATE two wings here! Â And you know I don't do wings... House Bacon - How can you not order of side of bacon? Â It's part of the artery clogging wonderful meal. Â Thinly sliced and greasy delicious!DessertsCrumpets with the bacon-manquet relish - who knew bacon could be part of dessert? Â The crumpets were amazing with the fresh maple syrup and relish, I loved it but it didn't come close to my new favorite dessert...Vanilla mascarpone doughnut holes, bacon-banana glaze, brown butter-oat strussel - BACON-BANANA GLAZE! Â Enough said, we ordered this TWICE! Â I washed all this down with two mimosas and some founder's beer.And I got to meet the chef! Â Definitely highlight of the afternoon, she's amazing!I'm still digesting all this food and trying to clear my arteries a full 36 hours later . Â This once in a lifetime meal has made the list of Â ""Last Meal on Earth"" if I ever had to name one. Â Well done, Stephanie! Hats off to the chef!"
"Awesome.Goat heart. Escargot ravioli. Pig face. An excellent salad. A dessert that we did not have room for but accommodated anyway! The food, drink, and service here are impeccable. One of our favorite spots. If only it was easier to get a reservation for a sane hour! =)"
"Heard a lot about this place, and got lucky when a friend with a large reservation had some cancellations in her party. She had booked 3 months in advance for a reservation for 10 at 8:30 on a Friday night. We got there 15 min beforehand, and had to wait over 30 minutes to be seated. Hence, the removal of one star. Overall, I would say it's worth the hype and the wait to experience this place once. We ate family style, with one half of the table being more adventurous, and the other half sticking to what we knew. I sampled a wide variety of the menu this way. Everything I tried was extremely tasty and flavorful--even the dishes on the adventurous half of the table. I don't normally eat parts like belly, face, or tongue but, I figured since I was there I had to have a bite of each--again, all good, but the texture wasn't for me, so one bite of each was sufficient.Even though we were eating small plates and sharing, we were all stuffed, and could have gone with less dishes. But save room for dessert, the bittersweet chocolate/mushroom gelato recommendations from other reviewers on here are accurate."
Such a great place with delicious food! We ordered a few things from each part of the menu and ate everything with big enjoyment. I don't like pork too much and I even ate the pig face which was incredible. There is not one thing on the menu I am not brave enough Â to try. Everyone definitely must try the cauliflower!!
"The Girl and the Goat..............America's great new restaurant according to a television show and critics...Vegetarian & carnivorous choices.....hmm....okay let's see what you got! Â The Good - Great rustic interior design with a funky oddball painting. Â Large crowd - many sound like first timers directed by friends or the media to try out this place. Â Semi-exposed kitchen -nice to see what's going on back there! Â Desserts - sort of...... Pistachio cake was acceptable - but, oh, why so small, am I an adult or toddler??The Bad - Wow, you got time for this? Â The portions are unbelievably small- but that's actually a good thing! (It would be tough to stomach a large portion of any of it!) Yes, I know foo foo places like the tapas style mini-dishes, but enough already! Â I am still unclear as to what type of restaurant this is trying to be. Â I've heard everything from American, New American, Fusion American. Â It ain't American anything! Â It is overly seasoned, overly salty, overly sauced French food in disguise! Â I know, I know, hot new chefs are supposed to tell us what we should like, but this is purely ridiculous! Â  If your idea of healthy meal is to hold super-sizing, then this place might be for you- it will have the salt & fat content you'd come to expect (but not the portion size). Â  My oysters were nearly flavorless (is that possible) and the Ham Frites were essentially Â bacon grease infused - super healthy! Â Also tried some Grilled Sepia - fine but the sauce was plain wrong-not sure what it was. Â If you are a fast food junkie, try the Pork Fat Donuts or the Lamb sausage stuffed calamari (yes someone at our table ordered it -but would not finish it!)The concoctions the ""top rated"" chef came up with is like a grade schooler fooling around the kitchen mixing things and having fun. Â  This is not my style of food - more like an island castaways idea of survival..... The Ugly - the food is ""trying"" waaay too hard. Â I kept an open mind going in, as I do with many new to me restaurants, but came out wishing I had not wasted my time. Â Beyond disappointed in all the hype generated by the media & critics. Â If you like intentionally mismatched flavors with an obvious French influenced seasoning style (style-not flavor), then maybe you will like this place.I know alot of people will disagree with me (this is probably one of the most popular restaurants in Chicago), but if you have more traditional tastes, this probably is not the place for you. Â If you have a brave stomach and a burning desire to be a trendsetter - give this place a try - at least the ambience is nice."
"I talk a lot of smack about places that have really big hype (purple pig), but sometimes I really like them (g.t. fish and oyster) and this place is one of the ones I like. Â It's true that it's obnoxious that you have to make your reservation weeks, even months in advance (both times we went, we made our reservations easily 6 weeks in advance in order to get a table at a proper dinner time). Â But it does give you something to look forward to for weeks, even months in advance... unless you're like me and you completely forget about the reservation until the day of and then get super psyched when you're reminded. Â Either way, it's fun.The food here is incredible. Â Nothing is too expensive (it's all small plates), so you don't have to worry about ordering up a third of the menu for four people (but you will spend a good $50 a person, so be prepared). Â Both times we went, we got the shishito peppers, omg they are amazing. Â This most recent time though, my two favorites were the english peas (we had to order another loaf of bread so we could sop up all of the awesome sauce!) and the broccoli, which was apparently brand new to the menu. Â The broccoli was served with crispy onions (like the kind on top of a green bean casserole but obviously better) and melted bleu cheese... YUM.The service has been amazing both times we've gone, although I find the amount of hosts they have disconcerting and cluttered. Â A former coworker of my boyfriend said she had been working 7 days a week because they needed servers but what I'm thinking is, why don't they train one of those little girly girls in the summer dresses standing around up front looking for something to do to wait on some tables?Oh, and I also like that Stephanie Izard was on the service side of the line, expediting orders. Â It's rare these days to actually have the famous head chef of a restaurant actually working there, and it's refreshing."
"Came her with a few friends and absolutely loved it! Â I'm a huge Stephanie Izzard fan and love her food. Â She has a great restaurant and wonderful beer selection. Â We loved everything we ordered. Â Loved how they planned out the meal for us going from lighter dishes to heavier dishes. Â Great service, great atmosphere, wonderful food, and good time with friends...what else could you ask for?"
"Absolutely blown away by every aspect of this dining experience last night. Â The service, decor, value/cost, and most importantly the food were all A1. Â It truly lived up to all the hype and was as good of an experience as I've found from New York to San Francisco and everywhere in between.First of all, the decor is amazing. Â Black metal and exposed duct work with warm wooden, community tables to balance it all out. Â It's a very comfortable layout, with an open kitchen...just a great overall design concept that promotes a super relaxed and friendly vibe while still being sort of upscale.The service was fantastic. Â Our server was confident, friendly, helpful and efficient. Â The runners were great, as well.But the food. Â Good lord...just too incredible for words, really. Â We got a pretty good selection across the menu, and everything was stellar in presentation and taste. Â They even have an in-house bread maker, and the bread was hot...not warm, hot. Â As in just made. Â With a nice caramelized onion butter and chimichurri sauce. Â You could live on that and probably be pretty happy.But the real action came in the form of the following:- Green Beans w/ fish sauce vinaigrette & cashews. Â The taste of the sauce was the ultimate in balanced richness...the beans were cooked *perfectly* al dente. Â Delicious.- English Pea Pods, buttermilk balsamic, botarga (if I would've known what that is, which is mullet roe, I may have skipped what was possibly the best vegetarian dish I've ever had) and sweet chips. Â Eaten like edamame, but 1,000,000 times tastier. Â I want to go back tonight and eat just this at the bar with a few selections from the kick-ass beer list.- Fried Soft-Shelled Crab Pakora w/ a spring onion curry & green tomato-fig chutney. Â I haven't had crab in like 15 years, and this was a nice way to be reintroduced. Â Definitely liked it, but I think I need more experience with crab in general before diving in again.- Halibut w/ brandade, grilled asparagus, green garlic & blackberry. Â Now, I've never even had halibut and don't really like asparagus, but this was a huge winner. Â 2nd favorite dish of the night, and one of the best seafood dishes I've ever had. Â Blackberry on fish? Â I was like..ok, we'll see. Â And then I was like...f*ck me.- Goat, Pork & Veal sugo w/ parpadelle, rosemary and gooseberries. Â I can't possibly explain this. Â Continuing the open-mindedness theme, I'd only had goat once, and wasn't a huge fan, but I'd read so many rave reviews about this dish, I said what the hell. Â Ummmm...best. decision. ever. Â This may have even topped the pork shoulder @ Bouchon for most satisfying meat dish on the planet. Â Impeccably prepared and seasoned, and whoever came up with putting gooseberries in it is a goddamned genius. Â Chef has my vote for President in 2012. Â Instantly my favorite restaurant in Chicago right now.Oh, and there was dessert!!! Â Blood orange sorbet, which already sounded promising, yet was made even more outrageous by the use of some type of take on creme fraiche and some now forgotten crispy, fried sweet things on top. Â As decadent as sorbet will ever get.So yeah...everything was spot on, from the food coming out quickly to walking in without a reservation and being seated immediately. Â What's more, I was expecting a much larger bill...all that food, bread, dessert and four drinks came out to $156 *including* tip. Â We walked out immensely satisfied on every level. Â Well done and can't wait to get back."
It lives up to its hype.
"I like the food here, but my husband and I both think it's way too salty. Â We like our food well-seasoned, but they are much too heavy-handed with it at G&G for me. Â I know salt is a very personal thing, but when I come home from a dinner completely parched, I have to believe that it's just more salt than necessary to make the food taste good. Â That being said, those famous green beans really are delicious...I just wish they came with a bowl of plain sticky rice! Â To me, that would be perfect--they're so highly seasoned, like a Chinese dish. Â We joked that we would lug over our rice cooker and ask for a table next to an outlet so we could cook our own pot of rice. Â :) Â The roasted cauliflower is delicious too, but ditto on wanting rice with it. Â I have had the opportunity to sample most of the veggies on the menu and they are all delicious, but the food does tend toward the heavy side here. Â The housemade breads are generally really tasty, and being a fan of baking bread, I appreciate the effort that goes into doing that.Service is friendly and prices are pretty reasonable. Â I don't know if it's worth quite the level of crazy hype, but it is an enjoyable place (if a bit loud). Â I do love Stephanie Izard's down-to-earth personality and devotion to local ingreadients. Â I will definitely come back, but probably would choose to have a more casual small meal at the bar or something. Â  I really wish things would calm down a little so it would be possible to get a table at a ""normal"" meal time without planning months in advance!"
What do you say that hasn't already been written? How about: RESERVE THE TABLE AT THE KITCHEN BAR!!The chefs are super cool and will usually give you a sample of dishes here and there. Â We got vodka shots! And the little goat figurines they use to hold down the orders are just precious. This place rocks. Congrats Stephanie Izard.
"I really do like this place but the OMG best meal ever reviews escape me. The food does tend to be over salted most of the time, and there seems to be ample examples of the dishes being a little off the mark in terms of balance. Overall it is a good restaurant but not amongst my favorites in the city."
"food: I LOVE GIRL & THE GOAT! LOVE!!! Â my favorite dishes include: shishito peppers (who knew parmesan & miso would go so well together!), roasted cauliflower, seared scallops, hiramasa crudo, grilled baby octopus, crispy pig face (veryy fatty), beef tongue, AND confit goat belly.service: LOVE the service! Â love love lovelvoelvoelvelvoeofinal thoughts: i wish chef stephanie would open a Girl & the Goat in LA!!!"
Amazing!Get the Goat Belly.
Was here few months ago. Seriously don't know why this place gets such good reviews. Nothing special. Very small and loud place. Food had no taste to me at all. I liked only one dish (broccoli). Frog legs were awful.
"As one of my students would say, ""Food so good, makes you want to slap yo mama."" I wouldn't suggest saying that while sitting next to your mother, my mom looked at me like I was crazy. After three wonderful visits to Girl and the Goat I am finally writing a review. Each of my visits have been a great experience from start to finish, with not a single dish I didn't love. The food is delicious, fresh, and consistent. The service is friendly, patient and helpful. Â I feel that the prices are very reasonable, and the portions are generous.My favorites in order are: 1. Pan Roasted Halibut 2. Goat, Pork and Veal Sugo . Pappardelle 3. Chickpea Fritters 4. Flank Steak Special 5. Grilled Baby Octopus 6. Grilled Oyster with lemon and horseradish 7. Every type of bread I have ever eaten at G&G Definitely make your reservation a month or two ahead of time. If you are a party of two, try to request the Chef's Table. The sights and smells of the kitchen are irresistible. I have been lucky enough to sit up front twice, and I do recommend sitting on the grill/fry side over the salad/dessert side. The guys working there are super fun and friendly! They spoiled us with samples of dishes we hadn't ordered (extra bonus) and playful banter. Â Girl and the Goat is definitely a Chicago standout."
"Decent dining experience overall, but way below expectations. The food quality was good, but few of the small plates we ordered were exceptional or different enough that they are worth mentioning. Of note was the excellent grilled broccoli. Two highlights of the evening were the wait staff and the flexibility of the kitchen. One of our party doesn't each cheese and the other doesn't eat meat. The kitchen split nearly every dish into two so that everyone could try all of the food ordered. I have rarely had such ready accomodation made for my party's weird eating habits. The other was the waitress. She was friendly and knowledgeable and very genuinely wanted us to have a great dining experience.Overall, the food was good and interesting enough that I am glad I went. However, don't expect the experience to live up to the hype of a 3 month wait for reservations!"
We loved everything there!! Service and Food were both outstanding. Right after our meal I made reservations for our next trip. The boyfriend and I prefer to cook at home and save our nights out for good food and this is definitely worth several return visits. Cannot wait to see what the fall menu is going to bring us. Oh and the prices could not be any better. You get a lot for your money!
"WOWWW Â Came through Monday night. And i wasn't disappointed at all Our server was beyond excellent! She knew the menu inside and out We took some of Â her suggestions Â and then some,We had the oysters the hamFrites the scallops, the beef tongue, the soft shell crab( my favorite) the beer and wine list was good and the cocktails were fun too. I recommend the Poloma which is Herradera tequila, St. Germain grapefruit Quite refreshing We tried as much as we could but couldn't fit dessert Â ! Will def be back in Â the near future !"
"I went here a couple weeks ago on a Wednesday night with three other friends. We arrived around 6:15 with no reservation because of course, they're booked up. The place was packed, but we found a couple of seats at the bar. It took about 45 minutes for a couch area to open up for us in the lounge. Our hostess for the dining area offered a table to us just under an hour and a half of being there, but we opted to stay and dine in the lounge (which is first come, first serve seating).The drinks were tasty and unique, and the bartenders and our server were very friendly. We tried several of their signature cocktails, and my favorite was the Flight of Three, much better than a couple of their gin cocktails (that I thought I'd prefer). I didn't think any drink or food was out-of-this-world good, but the sauteed green beans and baked oysters were pretty phenomenal. The wood oven roasted pig face, goat chorizo flatbread and bread with beer butter/cheese were all pleasant as well. I think this will be a great place to dine once the craze mellows out."
"Read 3.5 StarsFood = 3 starsService = 4 starsAtmosphere = 5 starsBeing able to say you took your wife and sister to Girl and the Goat and not get slapped in the face... PRICELESSUm. Â That doesn't quite get to 3.5, but if you are doing the math, I have a goat for you.On our culinary escapade and attempt to (regretably put on 5 lbs before my buddy's wedding) through Chicago, we ventured to Girl and the Goat to experience Top Chef Stefanie and her goat. Â I apologize in advance but I will use every possible opportunity to repeat the word goat... BAAAAHHHHWe actually dared to bring my 3 yr old niece who fit right into the hum of conversation and energy and a stack of free coloring paper and crayons we got from the Disney Store. Â (Thank you Ariel and Tinkerbell)Things I liked:Pork fat friesPig Face (Sounds disgusting, tastes AWESOME)Hangar Steak (Perfectly cooked)Oysters (Well seasoned)Steamed Clams w/ Yo Tiao (Chinese Donut) (it's clams!)CauliflowerRhubarb n' lemon dessert (yumm)Atmosphere and Service (Thanks Jodie)Things I didn't like:Goat CarpaccioGreen Beans (way too salty)The service was wonderful and the experience great. Â I really like how they try to allow you to enjoy the food by putting together your menu after you order. Â For instance, you tell the server what you want to order, and they bring out the food in a sequence that complements the flavor. Â Jodie even comped our green beans because the kitchen did not bring it out in the sequence she wanted. Â Overall, Stefanie did a good job of putting together a menu that consisted of comfort food, asian swagger, and goat... baaaahhhh Definitely can see why this place was hopping. Â I wish we could have seen the Top Chef in the kitchen that day, but I think it was her day off. Â Cool location with an awesome logo and giant painting of a girl and a goat... baaahhhh. Â The wait staff all had cool t-shirts but I couldn't part with the $40 to buy one (that was like 2 drinks) Â  Anyway, great date place and very accomodating for kids (they were great with my niece... even scrounging for ketchup for the fries... I joked that they had to run to 7-11 to buy it for her b/c they had some awesome dipping sauces for the fries) Â BAAHHHH"
"Went here for our Wedding Anniversary in October and was lucky enough to sit at the chef's table. Â WHAT A TREAT!!! Â Since their menu does change quite often, it is hard for me to look back at their menu now and tell you exactly what we ate. Â Here is my best guess based on their menu today...diver scallops - YUMwood oven roasted pig face - YUMwagyu tartare - YUMcampbell's bread - YUMsteamed west coast mussels - YUMwood grilled broccoli - Goodroasted cauliflower - OkayThe service was great and they also gave us some sample portions to try out while sitting at the chef's table. Â Thank you Girl and the Goat for making our Anniversary one to remember. Â My wife still can't stop talking about the whole experience. Â Excellent!"
"So we finally went to the Girl and The Goat. I made my reservations a month in advance and it was worth the wait. We were immediately seated and even though we were running a little late. Our waitress was nice and explain to us the menu.We started off with the breads. We had a Apple wood smoked bread with a pomegranate sauce and a ranch/ blue cheese sauce. That was $4.00.Then we order the Ham Fritters. Which were greasy and delicious. It is basically fries dip in duck fat with crushed ham all over. So good, that was $7.Then we order Seared Scallops which had pumpkin brandade, pecans, fried Brussels sprouts, tarragon and pomegranate. The plating was cool but I wasn't a big fan of it. That was $17. Then we had Goat, Pork And Veal Sugo which had pappardelle, rosemary and cape goose berries, that was OK, we weren't won by it and that was $15. Then we had Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face which had a sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro and potato stix, which was really good, the flavors we great and the plating was also great, that was $17. Finally we had Braised Beef Tongue which had masa, beef vinaigrette and salsa verde which was also great and that was $17.Overall the atmosphere was nice and the food was OK. I recommend this place if you are in the area and and if your a foodie."
"A few things we said to each other last night:""This place should be like the dentist's office, where they make sure you make your next appointment before you even leave.""""When we grow up and have our grown-up house, I want it to smell like this all the time.""""These chickpea fritters are the mozzarella sticks of the new millenium.""""The only thing I regret is not that we ordered too much, but that our stomachs weren't bigger.""I mean, this place is amazing. We ordered straight down the veggie menu-green beans, cauliflower, peppers, chickpea fritters (see above), squash blossom rangoon, and these amazing pancake things with tomato jam and other toppings. I know it's all been said before, but I had to add my two cents in. Especially cause we already made our next reservation....for December."
Never thought green beans and cauliflower can be made so well. Very trendy spot with great food. A little bit loud for such a nice place but definitely lives up to the hype.
"I liked it. I really did. It was salty and fatty and overwhelmingly rich...all of which make for a good meal, but it was not earth shattering and it did no0t explain the two month reservation wait and the 4:30 dinner slot. Here is what redeemed the whole experience: the chocolate cake with the mushroom gelatto...AWESOME! AWESOME! AWESOME!The service: Lindsay the server was kind and attentive without being overbearing. The comped us a plate we did not like and brought out a birthday dessert on the house. It's Â a scene and it's a hot spot. Previous reviewers complained about the price, but when dining on Randolph there's a price point. Did i mention salty? We must have gone through five bottles of water while there."
"We all loved it! Â My personal highlight: Â Waiter introduced me to Stephanie who autographed the copy of her cookbook that I'd brought with me. Â She was awesome!Food highlights for the adults: chickpea fritters, soba noodles, escargot ravioli, thai chili chocolate cake/gelato - surprising combinations of flavors that delight from the first bite until you find yourselves wishing you had more!Food highlights for the kids: pretzel bread and the ribs.Atmosphere: loud and casual enough we don't think our kids annoyed anyone while balancing spoons on their noses and worse, waiter was awesome and easy going, service was quick but we never felt rushed.Note: distictive scents of deliciousness followed us home"
"Loved it. It is hard to get a table. Went a Friday night at 10 pm Â it it a large space Â and noise, but it all part of the experience. Â This is not the place if you want to eat fast. Â It all small plates , part of the experience is order a few to start then just keep adding. I would recommend at least Â  go once. I will positively return Stephanie Izard is part of Chicago culinary experience."
"I'm not a big cauliflower guy. Â I don't like the way it looks. Â Maybe that's why wrestlers get ""cauliflower ear"". Â It's fucking ugly.But wouldn't you know it, the cauliflower at Girl+Goat was absolutely incredible. Probably my favorite dish we ordered.Also spectacular were the two breads we ordered and the various butters and oils provided as dipping sauces. Â Perhaps this explains why I was so full by the time our final dish (the green beans) arrived.The bittersweet chocolate cake was mos ballinest, and I don't use that term lightly.Despite sharing its name with a Tijuana sex show, G&G packs a whole lot of punch for a relatively small price."
"We got online and made a reservation for late on a Sunday this last week. We were shocked anything opened up but we jumped at the chance. The meal was fantastic. It's shared plates and our waiter told us that we should order 4-5 plates. We picked 6 plates plus bread-which was way too much food. We got the fat bread, shrimp, mussels, pig face, goat belly, peppers and green beans. The fat bread was out of this world. The mussels dish was the highlight though, just a different array of flavors than I was expecting. I though the pig face was fantastic as well. I would skip the green beans and goat belly. They had run out of the goat ribs, which I was disappointed. I thought for the food quality, the price was reasonable and would recommend trying to get a seat at G&G"
"Favorite restaurant in the country! Â Every dish is 5 stars. Hard to get reservations here, but worth the wait.Must get the pig face!"
"I'm giving G&tG an extra star in this update. The hysteria is still little bit overblown; however, my wife and I recently stopped by on a early Sunday afternoon and sat at two open bar seats. We had a drink and ordered 3 dishes (the green beans, a take on crab Rangoon, and a special seviche). It was a perfect place for a few bites an a drink (or two) - wine bar style. I perceived the salt levels to be moderated (relative to my original review) and the flavors were fantastic (as I've stated before). The bar service was friendly, helpful and laid back (it helps that they weren't super busy). I definitely appreciated what G&tG are doing a lot more on my most recent, more laid back, excursion."
"Food is defintely 5 stars. Â You'll be hard pressed to find better in the city. Â Only reason i didnt give it 5 stars total was b/c of how crowded and busy it is. Â reservations are almost a month out and the wait is and hour and a half even at 930 at night. Â Hosts almost discourage you to put your name in and try to push you into the bar area to eat which isnt exactly welcoming. Â Regardless, i keep coming back b/c of how good the food is."
"Phenomenal food...and yes, even for Veggies! Â 1/3 of the menu is veggie friendly. The chickpea fritters were a fave at our table and I was the only vegetarian with our party! It's all small plates. And the chef is so inventive with mixing ingredients and spices. Great environment - i call it urban barn. And the fact that they support the locavore movement makes the entire experience even better. It's worth the wait - either 2 hours without a rezzie or 2 months with one."
"Delish!! The menu has such a wide variety of options and everything we tried was excellent. I'm not a weird animal part eater but I tried the pig face....it was really good! The atmosphere is lively and good for larger groups from 6-12 people. The dishes are meant for sharing so the more people you have, the more you can try. Great service, outstanding food, affordable price. I will definitely go back again."
"I love the ambience and the food, but not the wait. In general though, if you are a fan of Top Chef and Stephanie Izard, its worth checking out.It is actually well priced (if you don't drink!). The flavors are delicious and unique. This is definitely a change of pace from so many other restaurants in Chicago. I applaud Stephanie Izard's creativity with the menu."
"Amazing. Â I have no words. Â Every dish I tried was simply awesome!I was there with 3 other friends and we shared everything making it an amazing experience! Â The marinated olives, sauteed green beans, chickpea fritters, and cheeses: all 5-star worthy!! Â You can't go wrong with anything on this menu!"
"Yes there is a long wait, but it wasn't that bad. Â You can also eat your meal in the waiting area (if you can score yourself a seat on the couches, you can have your entire meal there!). Â The couches were super comfortable, so it made our little over an hour wait not awful. Â Throughout the night, pretty much tried every single cocktail on their cocktail menu. Â Nothing was amazing, but nothing was bad either....Food-wise: started with the pancakes with heirloom tomato jam, shitake mushroom, and black pepper creme fraiche. Â This had to be my favorite of the entire night. Â So GOOD. Â I could eat a whole jar of that heirloom tomato jam. Â I'm craving it from California as we speak. Â Also got the hamachi crudo (the freshness of the hamachi really paired well with the crispy and salty pork belly) seared sea scallops (good, and the smoked goat at the bottom was a sneaky treat) soft shell crab (good, but nothing to write home about) pig face (a really rich and flavorful dish..def couldn't have eaten the whole thing alone) pork fat doughnuts (really yummy, but couldn't really taste any pork flavor).If I ever find myself back in Chicago again, I will definitely go (and hopefully they never take the heirloom tomato jam off of their menu)!"
"This place lives up to the hype in every way. The food is unreal, the service was perfect, there just aren't enough words to describe what a great experience Girl and the Goat provides. There were 8 of us and we all ordered 2 dishes and I was amazed by every single dish. My favorite would have to be the green beans, pig face and scallops. The scallops especially stood out to me because getting great seafood like that in a landlocked state is rare. I would and will recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a great meal at Â a reasonable price."
"Pig face. Â Order. Â The Pig Face.My wife and have been here twice, both for special occasions (anniversary and a birthday, and both times have been delicious meals. Â We love the atmosphere - trendy but not pretentious, and both times the service has been absolutely top-notch. Â Friendly, attentive, engaging and knowledgeable? Â Check! The small plate menu is, overall, really well put together - unique and adventurous without being too out there. Â Out of the 10 or so dishes we've tried, all have been, at a minimum, quite tasty, with most residing in the ""wow, this is delicious! Â And I love how that unexpected ____ accents the _____and really brings the ____ out!"" Â Without a doubt, though, the star of the current menu is the Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face. Â In crudest terms, it's a pork meat patty over french fries with an egg on top. Â In reality, it is one of the top 5 tastiest thing these lips have tasted. Â There's definitely a comfort food element to the dish, but then there are those unexpected ____s (in this case, the lick-your-plate-clean combination of tamarind, cilantro and red wine maple sauce) that take the dish from good comfort food to a truly delicious, refined and one-of-a-kind dish. Â Is it a pain to wait a month or more for reservations? Â Sure, but for that once a year occasion, the experience is worth it, I'd say. Â But seriously, PIG FACE."
"Great food here! So happy it's in the West Loop!We splurged and ordered the following (just for 2 of us)--pan fried shishito peppers-hiramasa crudo-lamb sausage stuffed calamari-wood oven roasted pig face-oysters, raw and cooked-goat liver mousselineAll were tasty. The pig face didn't have as much piggy flavor as I would have hoped but it was still tasty.My perfect bite here was the hiramasa crudo. Â Oh it's a perfect blend of everything my tastebuds like! Kudos to you, Stephanie!"
"I really loved Stephanie on top chef so I was super pumped to check this place out and although I love the ambiance and lively vibe the food fell a little short for me, while good I was expecting amazing, pig face was a greasy mess.. Â That being said I may have just went on an off night so I may have to give it another go to really give a better assessment."
I don't think I have ever given a restaurant a five star review but the Girl & the Goat deserves it. Â  I was with five friends and we decided to try 12 different things which turned out to be a great plan. Â I am not a cauliflower lover by any means....until I ate here. Â It was one of my favorite things on the menu. Â But the dishes in the seafood and meats categories were all outstanding. Â I admit I was skeptical of the restaurant before going there since I was well aware of all the hype but the reputation is well deserved. Â I can't wait to go back (but I know it will take a while to get a good reservation!)
"No reservation on a Tuesday night... we were worried to say the least! Â Our wait time was quoted at 90-120 minutes, but it actually lasted for only one leisurely round of drinks (bubbly please!) at the bar. Â We were seated at a communal table right next to the kitchen, so the noise level was high but manageable. Â The service was exceptional: we were given suggestions, but not in the pushy sales-person manner that I hate. I got to try a ton of different items, too many to discuss individually. Â To our surprise, the vegetarian items were standouts: Kohlrabi Salad and the Grilled Broccoli were fantastic. Â Goat Liver Mousse and Sugo were two other favorites. Â There are so many more things on the menu that I can't wait to try (the rest of my party had fish/seafood aversion). Â Finally, the dessert was phenomenal. Â We were there on my birthday so on top of the chocolate-watermelon granita heaven, we were comped a peach-pop-corn-bread-ice-cream delight. Â Our server also distracted Chef Izard herself from the prep line for a quick photo/signed menu as it was my birthday. I will definitely be back for another $$$$ dinner, or maybe just a few drinks and bites at the bar."
"I've been here a few times for dinner and although it's great I expected better. Â And nothing worse than leaving a place hungry. Â Which happened to me in all instances, although I do have a big appetite."
I've been to GATG twice now. Â I'm astounded that one place can have such perfect food and amazing service while still dealing with the demand they generate and a higher than normal level of trendy douchebags. Â  My most recent vist was to celebrate my mother's 79th birthday. Â We sat at a table at the end of the bar and a lovely girl named Natalie treated my mother like she was her mother. Â She was kind and patient and recommended the perfect food and cocktails. Â There is definitely a reason this restaurant has the ratings it does and it should not be missed.
"Just a lot of really interesting stuff, well prepared and seasoned and in creative combinations that make you think differently about the main components of each dish. Â Highlights:-Bread. Â Yes, you have to pay for bread. Â Don't skip it. Â Awesome fresh out of the oven warm bread with delicious homemade butter and chimichurri (or other options).-Sauteed green beans in a fish sauce vinaigrette: Wow, what a powerful vinaigrette. Â sour + umami central. Â This mightve been the highlight of my meal. Â Also, eating these deliciously full and almost crunchy green beans made me think I've been overcooking green beans for years.-Chickpea fritters: basically a dressed up falafel and hommus dish. Â But really tasty-Sugo w/pappardelle: an unbelievably delicious, rich ragu with thick rustic noodles. Â This is what a fantastic italian dish looks like when you need an excuse to sneak goat into it.We probably ordered too much food given that when our final dish came (the lamb shank), we were at capacity and in no place to enjoy it. Â Still it didn't pop for me, nor did the pig face, which was an enjoyable novelty but lacked the wow factor I was hoping for despite the fantastic presentation and being served under a fried egg in a sort of happy/breakfast/bacon play. Â Also, I found the lamb stuffed calamari to be a little dry texturally. Â Might skip these items next time and opt to explore more! Â If I can get another reservation that is..."
"Spectacular meal! Â Loved the space, Â amazing food (kudos to the chef and staff!), service, single person restrooms...cool experience. Â Loved the pig face with pomme frites and an egg! Â Not what I expected (did not resemble a pig's face), but I will get this again. Â Perfect dish!Cauliflower dish-Complex and amazing. Pickled peppers and pine nuts were such unique additions. Â I could have eatten the whole thing myself. Â Yumm.Cheese curd special with pulled pork over it-Wow! Â What a delicious, guilty pleasure. Â Double yumm.Another meat dish (cannot remember the name)-Delicious!Blood orange sorbet, pistachio cake, cornmeal crust (recommended by server)-Totally amazing! Â Dreaming of a bite of it right now!Our server was really, really helpful. Â She wanted to make our meal perfect, and I really respect places that put such effort into having such skilled staff to guide patrons in the right direction toward a great experience.Lovely! Â Can't wait to go back!"
"Hello, Top Chef fanatics! This restaurant features the creative, delicious menu of Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard. Â The menu will help push your taste buds out of the box. Â The menu is comprised of small plates, so you are able to order a few things and share! Â To start, I would highly recommend the oysters. Â The ""fried chunu"" will trick your palate with it's subtle hint of egg salad. Â The ""Not Campbell's"" is also amazing: giving you all of the flavor of your favorite childhood soup in a few bites of delicious bread! Â The confit goat belly is to die for: it's rich and melts in your mouth. Â For dessert, don't be shy (or scared!). Â The ""Bittersweet chocolate"" is incredible, and the shitaki gelato leaves you craving more. Â This would be a great place to go with some friends or for a date night, although, you have to be willing to spend some bucks."
"OMG. Â I'll be brief. Three people. Â Two dishes from each column, including two desserts. Â Everything exquisite. Â Izard herself checking dishes before they leave the kitchen. Â Service - perfect. Â She even remembered seeing the other two in my party the previous week. Â When I left, I made a reservation for four for the next available Saturday OR Sunday at 7-ish. Â It's in August (on a Sunday), and I can't freaking wait! Â And one other reservation ... one of the 12-tops in the back for my birthday ... in January. Â It was THAT good. Â I can't wait for August. Â :)"
"Yes yes yes YES, go here. Â As everyone mentions already, the food is delish for the price. Â I love food. Â My few comments, though: Â Sorely disappointed by the cauliflower. Â It tasted like steamed cauliflower with a dash of pepper. Â After all of the hype I was very sad. Â But my tears were comforted by the ham frittes, which could be the most unhealthy thing on the menu but 100% worth the risk of cardiac arrest. Â It was dripping in some kind of beer bacon oil, omg, so sinfully good mmmm. Â The shishito peppers were also dripping in some kind of garlic oil but were so freakin' good. Â If you like garlic and spicy, get the peppers. The crudo was good, but the serving was a bit on the small side and it didn't blow my mind. Â The walt's chicken was delicious as well, that was the BFs favorite. Â Holy crap. Â I want to go back right now.Also, our server was awesome (!!!) and the beer/wine wasn't horribly priced. Â Great place! Â Great vibe. Â Make reservations and go. Â Do it."
"My husband and I made a reservation 3 months out and got a 7:15 reservation on a Thursday night. Â I had honestly forgotten it was coming up and wasn't as excited as I was when we got reservations at Next. Â However, it blew me away. Â We were seated shortly after our reservation and got a great bottle of wine. Â We ordered the yellowtail with pork belly, the goat chorizo flat bread, the calamari over rabbit ravioli, the braised beef tongue, and the confit goat belly with lobster. Â Everything that came out was better than the last thing. Â Service was spectacular, food was absolutely amazing, we couldn't stop raving about it. Â We loved the small plates so you could try more - there was still a ton on the menu we wanted to order but couldn't fit in! Â I look forward to my next trip."
"Lots of food in small little bites. Â Can be expensive. Â Go early or expect not to get reservations for a few months. Â Communal table was a bit strange. Â Had a delicious kholrabi salad, goat empanada and the roasted cauliflower are well worth the price. Â enjoyable if not a little awkward at a communal table."
"""YES YES YES YES!"" Â That's what I thought after my meal at Girl and the Goat, I may have screamed it... I don't remember. Â Finally, a restaurant I genuinely love across the board: Â food, service, ambiance, food, beer list, price point, FOOD. (Well, minus the fact that I need to know in December if I want to eat dinner there in February, but I can live with that. Â I like a challenge.) Â And this fantastic restaurant is in my hood!Far be it from me to downplay some of the West Loop heavyweights; Â Blackbird, Avec and Sepia are great, but I was just bored of them. Â BORED. Â I can only eat so many chorizo stuffed dates before I'm tapped (so many is like 3928, but you know what I mean). Â I'm glad G&G came to add a little excitement to my life, I'm pretty sure enough of the 400 prior reviews mention that great lofty interior, the kind and informed waitstaff and on and on... but even if every review mentioned this one thing, I would say it again.Get the sugo. Â Unless you're a veg (or even then?) get the sugo. Â SUGO. Â How can I get you to remember this... a mnemonic? Â Suck Up Goat Often. Â There. Â Perfect."
"I've given Girl and the Goat a few chances. I don't know why yelp boasts GATG as a vegetarian-friendly spot. I ordered meatless dishes and left with a stomach ache after every visit. Â Unless you're into excessive salt and entirely too much cream, I'd avoid this place."
"Got lucky & a friend hooked me up with a reservation when I was recently in town. Â Did have a nice meal & some of the dishes were spectacular. Â That said, not sure this is someplace I would wait months to dine? Â Service was nice, if a bit casual. Â Wine list so reasonable. Â Overall I couldn't believe how low our bill was - wearing my NY prices mindset, I was pleasantly surprised by that.Had 10 dishes & standouts were goat belly, green beans & pig face. Â Nothing was not good, but felt like these 3 took typical preparations and imparted some new flavor combinations which I'd not tasted before."
By far the best food I've ever eaten in my life. I loved that there were typical menu items with a special twist and extreme things that blew my mind. The party I was with enjoyed our food so much we felt compelled to applaud the kitchen before we left. I can't wait to come back here again!
Don't believe the hype. Â If you like to be seen and like trendy spots AND you like your food so salty you're eyes will water then you'll love this place. I'm stunned at all the good reviews. A bunch of sheep following the crowd.
"So it is a little weird for me making reservation for a Tuesday at 10pm two months in advance, but having said that, it was well worth the wait! Really friendly staff, and amazing food. Waiter really took the time to explain the dishes (I love good food but can't say I'm a bonafied foodie). One thing I have to say is that you don't have to wait 2 months to get a reservation! The waiter explained to me that if you go on a weekday either early (4pm) or late (9-10pm) you may not have to wait long for a table. Also, the bar is first come first serve, and they provide the full menu."
With 1140 reviews before mine I'll keep this short. We had a fantastic meal with great service. The confit goat belly with crab and lobster was the best take on surf 'n' turf I've ever had. After we'd gone through all six of our dishes we ordered it again.I liked the grilled baby octopus salad but my wife thought there was too much going on in the plate.Beer selection is decent.Service was very friendly and helpful.I can't wait to go back.
"Went around 4:30 on a Saturday night without a reservation. When we got there the bar area was completely full & there were no free tables. Luckily, we were able to snag part of the couch area and eat there. Our server, Mandy was incredibly friendly and helpful. She had tons of great recommendations. We ended up over-ordering and eating it all. Fat kids. The best:- Chickpea fritters (little fried pillows that melt in your mouth)-Pig face (sounds crazy, but fatty & delicious)-Pan fried shishito peppers (covered in a creamy sauce and a little spicy)-Fried oysters (took oysters to another level for me)-Chocolate flourless cake w/ shittake gelato (on its own the gelato tasted like straight up mushroom, but with the cake it was the perfect combination)-Pork fat fried donuts ( do I really even need to write anymore about these?)Things I wouldn't order again:-The hiramasa crudo ( not worth the money for 3 tiny pieces of fish)-The cheese plate (good cheese, but I could get this anywhere)-Goat chorizo flatbread (it was cool to try chorizo made of goat meat, but not completely worth it)Overall, Girl & the Goat was a great experience. It gets really crowded & noisy so be prepared. Definitely worth trying!"
"After reading all the reviews, I was determined to try here. In spite of a serious thunderstorm, I dragged my friends out to put our names down at 5:30pm on the wait lists. We were promptly informed of a 2 hour wait. I know it was going to be long so whatever, we went down the street to Nollcote and drank up. Â We returned to check on seating after 1.5 hrs and was given the same answer with some condescension and slight roll in the eyes. In retrospect, this place is more dressy than casual... so I perhaps I should have dressed up a little more. Regardless of my attire (no where specified this was ""dressy""), I didn't appreciate the attitude. My friends and I were finally seated around 7:40 at a table that was not quite designed for 3 people. Hey we squeezed in on a Saturday night, so Â I can't complain. We ordered a total of 6 dishes (I had accompanied dinner with a glass of Â very good pinot noir): *Corney bread with goat cheese butter and corn relish. One food critic once said that you can measure the quality of restaurant by how soft the butter was and this tangy goat cheese butter was so spreadable! The bread had a little corn in which made a nice touch. The corn relish was an interestingly accompaniment.... it had great acid, but considering the tangy-ness of goat cheese butter, I would have preferred a sweeter corn relish. *kohlarabi salad with shaved parm+ fennel, blue berries, toasted almond and creamy ( i think buttermilk dressing). Â Interesting and inventive mix.* Chickpea Fritters with caponata and mozzarella. Forgot the caponata- the chickpea fritters are the star- perfectly fried with amazing, delicious creamy center. I am writing to BA for the recipe!* Goat belly + lobster and crab salad. Melting-ly tender, caramelized goat belly with lobster and crab. Enough said!* Baby octopus with wax beans, string peas and Â mysterious savory mix of caper, lemons and unidentified ingredients. This dish had super umami flavor. If I had a craving for something savory, one bit of this will squash that craving in all of 5 seconds. * Wood oven- pig face- this is/was suppose to be all time classic, which consists of pork (shoulder?), tamarind sauce, cilantro vinaigrette and fried egg. Â I actually prefer the other dishes better. The pork was executed well, tender with crispy edge. The tamarind compliments the pork... but the WOW factor just wasn't there for me. Overall food was excellent. I had a thoroughly enjoyable dinner food wise. The entire meal was ruined when our server rudely toss the dessert menu at us before we cleared our plates and said ""sorry we have another 9:15 dinner reservation."" Â Seriously lady (excuse me, Taylor)- it was 8:50p & we had sat down for all of an hour and ten minutes-do you rush everyone like that? Hope Â the services will be better next time! Minus 1 star!"
This was my favorite place in Chicago for dinner. Â It was at 1145 and worth the wait!Favorite dish: Â Pig face!Awesome restaurtant and great service! Try not to get an all meat dish. Â Switch it up a bit. Â Some people complained that this place served really saltfy foods.
"Unreal. Â The winner of Top Chef is as good as I've ever had. Â If she can make a cauliflower appetizer that changes your life....she's good. Â Between myself, my girlfriend, and our friend from NYC that was visiting....we had 3 appetizers, 4 mains, 2 desserts, and every cocktail on their list. Â It was amazing...I can't say one bad thing about this place. Â The only thing is that obviously there is a big wait for this place...so plan accordingly. Â Trying to get a seat at the bar for 3 of us was really tough but we managed it...I felt like Dennis Rodman boxing out for a rebound...but it happened.The service was soooo good as well. Â I love Tapas style places...it seems as though all of the food came out with perfect timing. Â The bartender (Amy), though busy, was super accommodating and helpful. Â Not to mention a great drink maker! Â Anytime head chef Â that is there expediting the food orders and still finding time to greet people and take pictures with fans is alright by me. Â Don't miss this place if you're in Chicago....make time. Â You won't regret it."
"YUMMO! Ordered quite a few dishes and everything was great. I do agree with Winston G. that many dishes were over seasoned. My mouth started hurting towards the end of the night.... Things to order: ROASTED CAULIFLOWER. How do you make cauliflower taste so darn good???? TELL ME? Just give me a huge bowl of this and I will be content for the rest of my life. Goat Empanadas: So good, but a little on the heavy side. I was kind of disappointed that it was our last dish and I was already so full from everything else. Octopus is light and refreshing. A good little change from all our heavy dishes. After the goat empanadas, I wanted something light and refreshing (sorbet). Waitress suggested that I order the blood orange sorbet. DONE. Then she came back and said they were out. TEASE!!!!!!"
"Yet another well-worth trip to Girl and the Goat. My friend's friend was visiting from out of town so we seized the opportunity to have dinner here. I was willing to break my daily diet and exercise routine just for this dinner.Pretzel bread - tasted amazing warm (probably because I was starving), my friend said it tasted more like whole wheat bread, not very good when coldKohlrabi salad - loved it so much the last time I had to order it again. Just as good as I rememberedGoat carpaccio - once again my favorite of the night. Chickpea fritter - not sure if it's a different dish from the last time I had it, but it was really good this time, the contrast between the warm fritter and the cool mozzarella was a good match.Goat cheese tortellini - came in two giant tortellinis. Really good dish. I'm starting to like goat cheese more and more. Wish it came in smaller pieces though because it was difficult to share without losing the filling when you cut it.Roasted beets - I was never a fan of beets (and still am not) so I might be biased in saying this dish wasn't that great...though all the other components of the dish was really good!Soft shell crab - thought it would be the same one as last time, but this one came in a coconut broth and Thai chili aioli. This was my friend's favorite dish of the nightGoat cheesecake - The best dessert of the night. Tasted like light whipped goat's milk/cheese. Definitely a must-tryQuatro leches cake - came with cereal streusel...wasn't impressed by itChocolate cake - very rich, paired well with the sorbet and lemon cream. An excellent choice for chocolate lovers.Pros: amazing food, really amazing and memorable service (I didn't catch our waiter's name at first..but our bill said his name is Brennan...so thank you!! really outstanding service!)Cons: nothing really....besides the uncomfortably full feeling afterwards"
"if you can get in, it's worth it. After waiting for 6 weeks, we finally scored a 10pm reservation for dinner. Love the design and atmosphere. High ceiling, open kitchen, burnt wood walls, dimly lit. There are 6-7 vegetarian dishes, but ask the server just to be sure.Every dish we ordered had a surprising flavor. The Hits:-shishito pepper (good, but not really that hot/spicy)-roaster cauliflower (my fav)-seared scallops-wood oven pig face (great! try not to think about the name)-escagot ravioli-chickpea ftitters (my fav)-goat empanadas-sauteed prawns DESSERTS-chocolate bouchon (surprisingly good considering it had foie gras in it)-pork fat doughnuts-goat cheese bavaroisthere we only a couple misses:the grilled octopus (a little chewy) and the beet salad (a little too tart)."
"excellent place.could not get a res, but was put on a waiting list and received an excellent phone call 2 days prior to my chicago trip with an opening.arrived 15 min late and had no issues, dining room very large and dark with a cool vibe.awesome, patient waiter with great suggestions. cocktails were stellar,gf was scared of the pig face entree and the goat heart, too bad.pork shank was amazing........amazing. scallops very good,cauliflower was impressive and large portioned. an excellent meal, will return."
"Nothing to say that hasn't been said ~600 times before, but it's all true.I've gone twice now, once with the boy, once with the boy and my mom, who is famously picky, hates anything spicy or onion-y, etc., whereas I thrive on these things. Nevertheless, we all had amazing meals.Both times I've walked in with no reservation on the early side of dinner, and both times managed to score a lounge area seat within ten minutes - so if you don't mind an early dinner (or have a teacher spouse whose bedtime is, like, 9), you'll have a much easier time getting quick service. First, the only thing that might be 4 or 3.5 stars - the cocktails aren't as Completely Balls Out Amazing as the food, so if you're like me and saving your money for nights like this, I'd just stick with water and order another dish (or two or three).The pig face: yes, it is as good as everyone says. Our waiter enthusiastically told us to appreciate the presentation for a second (which is superb) and then just mash everything together, and he was correct. Your mouth has a fancy breakfast party. Phenomenal.The green beans: yes, they are as good as everyone says. Already one of my favorite veggies, just the right amount of salty-fishy-tangy delight, the beans are still crisp... amazing.Escargot ravioli: I'm not a huge escargot person - most of the time they taste like slimy bits of butter. These are perfect. We were told to forgo dignity and put the whole thing in your mouth at once, soup dumpling style, and yes, do that, do that now. Sweet potato gratin: one of the TWO complimentary dishes our server brought out (let it be known, my mother is the master of the friendly middle-aged lady flirting school). The blue cheese was a great touch - I usually avoid it and my fiancÃ© can't stand it, but both of us appreciated the touch it gave to the dish.For dessert, we ordered the bittersweet chocolate. And yes, it comes with shiitake gelato. Yes, mushroom ice cream. It works. I do not know what sorcery was required, but it works. And I absolutely HATE mushrooms.Anyway, believe the hype, take a day off from work or otherwise figure out how to get in, and eat eat eat. I'm back to figuring out how to get Stephanie to cater my wedding pro bono."
"What a FANTASTIC night spent here with my boy for our one year anniversary. Â We had to make reservations three months in advance, but we enjoyed every minute of our time here.After telling our hostess who we were and what time our reservations were for, we immediately asked, like two tween girls looking for Bieber, ""Umm...is Stephanie Izard here tonight?!"" Â Our hostess said that she was, and took us the 'long way' to our seats so we could catch a glimpse of the master at work. Â So cool!Anyway, we sat down and our incredibly helpful waitress explained the menu to us well. Â We ordered some Miso Hungry bread to start, parm crusted with two different spreads- both delish. Â We then had the chickpea fritters, which were melt-in-your-mouth and covered in romesco sauce, hazelnut hummus, and creamy goat feta.Next up were the ham frites, crispy, salty little fries covered in ham chopped so fine we called it ham dust. Â I usually love aioli, and the smoked tomato aioli that came with it was not quite my thing, but the smoked swiss sauce was awesome. Â The goat, pork and veal sugo with pappardelle and rosemary was incredibly rich, warm, and perfectly complimented with sour gooseberries. Â This was upscale comfort food at its finest.Our last main dish was one of the specials- fall-apart, (kinda fatty but delectable) goat breast with warm, delicious, homemade tortillas, perfectly-spiced mole sauce, and crispy coleslaw. Â For dessert, we had the blood orange sorbet with parsnip pot de creme, pistachio cake and cornmeal crust. Â I could not believe how the flavors worked so well together, but they really did. Â I had two of the cocktails, both of which were incredible. Â I can't remember the name of the first one; it had Pimm's and cucumber and was great. Â The second, The Aviator, was so different from any cocktail I've had- aromatic and bitter at the same time. Â The waitress brought us two complimentary glasses of champagne for our anniversary, which was so unexpected but just really made our night special. And, oh yeah, we got to take a picture with Steph. Â She's the best."
"I would give it 3.5 if I could...I really wanted to love this place, but there were a few things off with the dishes we ordered. We went Sunday night without reservations. We only had to wait 30 minutes, they originally told us 60-90. We were pleasantly surprised!We were seated at a communal table which is always a bit odd, but it was ok and we had a great view of the kitchen. I really liked the space they created--a bit vintage with a touch of ruggedness. It is pretty loud, though.Here's what we ordered:1. one of the breads of the day-tomato butter; just ok. The bread was hard in less than 10 minutes.2. green beans-too salty/too much overpowering sauce. The first serving was good, but the subsequent servings I put on my plate had sat too long in the fish sauce that made it way too salty.3. chickpea fritters-ok; nothing to write to mom about.4. Pig Face-unique but I don't think I would order it again. 5. Goat empanadas-way too salty and too much sauce.6. Pork fat doughnuts-nothing special.Overall, I don't know if I would go back. It did not live up to the hype."
"So this one is waaaaaaay overdue, but what hasn't already been said in the hundreds of Girl and the Goat's positive reviews? Â In terms of atmosphere this place is awesome. Â Plenty of energy in the room (doesn't hurt that they've been packing em in since day one), and I'm a big fan of the loft/industrial feel of the space. Â Very urban, very cool, and - nowadays - very hard to get a table. Our party of 8 was fortunate enough to get seated at one of the large tables directly in front of their open kitchen. Â Probably one of the best seats in the house to see Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard do her thing. Â When it comes to the food, I can certainly say I didn't try anything bad, but there were definitely some dishes that I enjoyed much more than others. Â Personal highlights include:* anything from their rotating bread menu - I particularly enjoyed the honey lemon butter and honeycomb that night* hiramasa crudo - comes with crispy pork belly, what's not to love?* soft shell crab - expertly fried and served with a nice spin on elotes (sweet corn)* goat, veal, and beef sugo - flavorful and comforting* green beans - rave reviews from the entire table* wood oven roasted pig face - smoky, oh so porky good I'll definitely have to come back for the whole roasted goat leg, it looked absolutely ridiculous. Â While we did try a number of other dishes that I wasn't crazy about, I will say that G&G was still relatively new at the time, so perhaps they just needed some time to work out the kinks. Â Given the latest rave reviews and jam packed reservation books, I'm pretty sure that was the case.Service was top notch - casual, friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu and wine list. Â To cap off my review, I'd just like to mention how approachable and down to earth Stephanie Izard is in person. Â She was nice enough to take a few moments to chat with our table (and take the obligatory picture) and there wasn't one spec of an iota of a hint that she wasn't genuinely happy to step away from the kitchen to interact with her customers. Â A very cool and memorable experience at the end of the day, and I most definitely plan on coming back again."
"Don't be a contrarian ninny. The place has, like 4-5 stars from almost 600+ people. They can't all be employees. Do you really think you're the wise sage that will discover this places suddenly sucks? Honestly.Since 2012 is almost nigh, i won't waste your time. Unless you are a die-hard vegan, make some space in your ever decreasing time left to Go eat here. Bring some friends too. The only reason i even bothered to jump on this pony was to reiterate something from the other ramblings. it's minor since it's camouflaged well, but save some cash for a giant bottle of water before bed. Thank me now for the advice, you'll know what i mean at that time."
"I'm always suspicious of places with a lot of hype, but Girl & the Goat totally lived up to it.I was there with a group of ten people. Â We met there and were seated once our party was there. Â And then the food massacre got underway. Â We were all experienced diners, ready to try good food. Â A couple people had been before and had suggestions, but at some point my brother decided we should order one of everything on the main menu. Â Plus one of the goat legs that they offer to large parties. Â Plus some of the oysters. Â Plus some of the breads. Â And some wine. Â And a few desserts.We successfully split every item from the main menu. Â And got to try over half of the starters. Â I'm not going to single out items I liked or didn't like, because every dish was good. Â Sincerely. Â And the goat leg was great - lean, but not dry, with nice accompanying sauces. Â I need to go back another time."
"I was very fortunate to inherit a spot in my bf's friend's reservation that was made before I was even around. (In short: lucky.) This was a dining experience I had anticipated ever since Stephanie Izard competed on Top Chef (loved her on the show well before she won), augmented by recent write-ups in Chicago Magazine and Food & Wine.I had very few complaints about this dining experience, but I want to get those out of the way before I begin to gush. The restaurant is smoky - there's a visible haze and a general air of wood smoke. I loved this when I first walked in. I loved this less when I could still smell the smoke on my clothes the next day.Also, I wasn't familiar with the dining scheme - small plates, meant to be shared. That might be my own fault for not doing the proper research, and it turned out just fine. The only thing I didn't get was a clear concept as to where we were in the meal as the dishes came out as they were ready, typically one to two at a time. Lastly, the place is called Girl and the GOAT - when I return, I will be ordering far more goat and less of everything else. More on that at the end - for now, time to gush.First off, I came in knowing I'd be drinking red wine all night (GOAT!). I had my heart set on Cab, though any more info about that first glass escapes me because I switched to the ""Girl and the Goat"" red blend (50% Petit Verdot, 25% Shiraz, 25% Merlot... if memory serves) - a perfect complement to nearly every dish we ate. Friends enjoyed various cocktails and beer. Draught selection was small, but all good options.We ordered a loaf of ""Bloody Mary"" bread (part of a rotating fresh-baked bread selection) and two plates of oysters (never my favorite, but the one I tasted - a wood-fired Tomahawk - was delicious, augmented by horseradish and bacon). Then, the onslaught of plates began. Some favorites:Fried squash blossom (like the best bar food ever)Beet salad w/anchovies (mild, well-balanced)Grilled baby octopus (amazing! not overly chewy either)Goat empanadas (wish I could go into a Mexican restaurant and order a plate of these)Confit goat belly (drooling just thinking about it)and the best dish I've eaten in a long time:Skewered lamb hearts, crispy sweetbreads, potato aioli, ramps, strawberries. (Agreeing w/Anthony Bourdain here. It's all about the organs.)The attempts at more delicate fish dishes were a miss for me: hiramasa crudo was dominated by heat and spice, and the seared tuna was overtaken by (very tasty) lamb sausage. The salmon tartare was the only ""light"" fish dish that worked for me - salmon with squash, truffles, and (what tasted like) some light citrus, served with little crackers. Reminded me of a salmon ceviche.Dessert was phenomenal. I'd sell my soul for the goat cheese bavarois (wonderfully ""goaty"" with tart berries), and after reclaiming my soul from the Devil, would gladly resell it for the pork fat doughnuts loaded with chocolate ganache. The other desserts won honorable mentions - the basil flavor in the strawberry shortcake overpowered at times, and though I surprisingly loved the shittake gelato served with chocolate, the chocolate itself was granular. It was like a grown-up dirt cup, but lacked some of the flair of the other three desserts.So, in all, an extremely good dining experience. If I were to go back, here's what I'd do differently:Order anything that looks more adventurous (i.e. hearts/sweetbreads)Order seafood that can stand up to heavy ingredients (i.e. octopus)Order anything fried (i.e. squash blossoms, pork fat doughnuts)Order more goat (i.e. GOAT!)"
"Great flavors and unique food combinations. The green beans are amazing. Same thing with the roasted cauliflower. Price was reasonable for the high quality and artistic food. Two suggestions. 1. Ease up on the onions. They seemed to be in everything. 2. Work on the service. Our waitress was super nice and helpful, but the other wait staff seemed very confused and kept bringing out the wrong orders."
"I went to this place after hearing a lot of awesome things about it. My boyfriend and I went there at 10:45 PM at night (since that was the only time available for reservations) and we were pleasantly surprised!For the two of us we shared 4 plates:-Duck duck goose bread-Diver scallops-Pig face-CauliflowerAll of these dishes were very well prepared. If you are really looking to explore a lot of different kinds of flavors and dishes but aren't that hungry, I would suggest skipping out on the bread. It was fantastic, but I don't think there was anything too special about the taste and it just made us full a lot faster. The cauliflower was extremely tasty - very colorful but with a minty fresh aftertaste (which surprisingly goes well together). The scallops and pig face were both awesome - my personal favorite were the scallops but my boyfriend loved the pig face, so I guess it really depends on if you're more of a seafood person or a meat person. Either way, we truly enjoyed both dishes and would definitely wait another 2 months to eat here again.Besides the food, which is already very talked about, my boyfriend also commended that the service there was extremely good. One of his benchmarks for good service is that the waiters and servers never let you reach the bottom of your glass, and they were extremely good at that. Believe me, we tried to consciously take sips of our water to see how long it would take them to refill it. I mean, we weren't chuggin down our drinks, but we put in a lot of effort to drink when needed. But still, they just kept making rounds, refilling our drinks, never letting them get too low.Otherwise, it was a good nice. We even got ham frites - on the house! :)"
Instructions:Go there and have the green beans. Â Thank me later. Repeat.
"This is the kind of place you go to, knowing you're going to spend a good amount of money but don't care because its so good and a cool experience. Â This place is run by someone who won some cooking show on tv. Â She has a great menu that changes from time to time. Â The menu is broken down by what the main part of the dish is. Â There are different meats including and vegetable. Â Everything we had was great especially the bread with different spreads to start the dinner. Â It is fine dining but is casual dress and has the feeling of a laid back bar. Â It's a bit of a drive outside downtown but it's worth it."
"Just fantastic. Stephanie Izard is a queen in the kitchen. Â You can't go wrong with any of the dishes, but I highly recommend the sugo. The dishes are surprising and complex, but without consistently delicious without fail.Another added bonus: the waitstaff is incredibly helpful."
"This place may end up being one of two things: a passing fad- a trendy ""it"" restaurant or a coveted restaurant with an inventive menu. It's hard to say which it is currently, I stopped by and it was- of course, really busy. My bf and I didn't mind we sat in the lounge area and had our dinner. The cocktails were great, the menu interesting and inventive. The food is rich, really rich, lots of butter, lots of heavier sauces, lots of gravy, lots of meat, lots of salt. Generally all of the courses except for one, was over salted for my palate (and I love salt...just saying). My issue with this french-ish style menu is that it's not very fresh. There's nothing really tasty and healthy on the menu, it's all decadent, if that's what you're going for you'll love it. I however need a little more freshness with my meals.It's worth trying, make a reservation and wait at least a month to get in or do as I did and sit wherever you can find a seat in their large lounge/bar area and wing it (probably not on the weekend however)."
"Had a fabulous experience. The bartender was awesome, extremely helpful. He pretty much suggested things and they all sounded awesome so we ordered it, same our drinks. The food was fabulous and we were full at the end. Love the mood of the place. The people who work their extremely helpful and nice. Thank you!!!"
"This restaurant is completely amazing. Â I have to say off the bat that the only reason it didn't get 5 stars is because I can never get a reservation! Â Hrumph. Â I was entertaining a few guests who are total foodies, and they were impressed. Â We tried 3 different types of bread, my favorite being the pretzel. Â We also had the oysters different ways - best raw of course. Â The only ""starter"" that not everyone went crazy over were the green beans. Â I happened to like them though :) Â The roasted beets were also amazing.My favorite dish remains the hiramasa crudo with the pig face as runner up. Â Another excellent one is the scallops. Â Yum.I will be back - if I can ever get a reservation!"
Unbelievable. Foodie heaven. Mmmmm...... Pig Face is a must try. Confit Goat belly is delish. Â Tempura Soft Shell Crab was great but would have to try the crudo or the baby octopus next time. Can't wait to come home just so I can go back here.
Come here to fall in love with food!!!!I recommend you order at least one thing from every section of her menu because you don't want to miss a thing! From the bread course to dessert it was pure perfection!!!!! It is worth the wait for a reservation. Now I understand why everyone loves this place so much. Best meal I have had in....well...maybe EVER!!!!!! Love it!!!!!
"Two words--So Overrated. I was eager to try this place out, Â but I think it was like a lot of other restaurants in Chicago. It was good, but in no way incredible. Â (I agree with Dan R.'s review below --there was nothing that amazed me here.) Â I just didn't think this place lived up to the hype at all and it is seriously overpriced. (Our tab averaged about $60 per person including tax and tip but not drinks.) The chickpea fritters were good as were the green beans, but for crying out loud, it's a green bean. For me, this was totally a ""The Emperor has no clothes"" kind of experience. No one, after waiting 2 monrths for a reserrvation wants to say, yeah it was fine but that's it.Maybe because I spent 8 weeks in France and Italy, (but I don't think so) where food is truly an art form, and you don't have to pay an arm and a leg for truly fabulous food and an unforgettable (which this was not) dining experience.) ( I had a salmon in puff pastry there ten years ago Â that I still dream about--best thing I've ever eaten in my life and it was a meal for the U.S. equivalent of like $20.) Â Back to G & tG, I was there with a group of 5 and all but one of us thought it was nice to try it but it wasn't so compelling that we felt any need to return. And the music is so loud that you really have to yell to have a conversation."
"Basically one of the best dining experience in Chicago. My wife took me here for my birthday though she made reservations two months in advanced and only could get us a 4:30 on a Monday. Didn't bother me though. They open at 4:30 and the place was packed within the first half hour. Food was absolutely delicious, the cocktails were superb and our service was fantastic. Overall, our experience was a delight. A lively atmosphere with delicious food and drinks. We will go back. Now to try Little Goat."
"I'm going to start off by saying that I do not like offal and I think that the current fascination smacks of pretention. That said, we just avoided the meat side of the menu, which is pretty much all offal. Â We did try the pork ribs which were very well prepared. Â The breads were good, and the fennel butter was delicious. Â I really liked the hiramasa crudo with pork belly, and the octopus was tasty, even if there was so much stuff on the plate you could barely taste the octopus. Â I had a very nice glass of wine. Â The server and hostess were great. Â The desserts were a little too savory side for me, but to each his own!"
Worth every bite. Recommend getting three to four sides for a table. Pork belly is a must. Beer menu is great! Service is en par with quality of food.
"A group of girlfriends went this summer to celebrate a special birthday. Â We could not get a reservation but had heard such rave reviews, we decided to roll the dice and put our names in for the first available seat. Â We were told it would be about 1 1/2 hours so we ventured down the street for a couple glasses of wine. Â When we returned 1 1/2 hours later we were told it would be another 20 mintues. Â An additional 2 1/2 hours and a bottle of wine and fresh oysters later, we were finally sat. Â I was ready to eat my hand and kept threatening my friends that Â THIS BETTER BE WORTH IT!!!! Â It was SOOOOO worth the wait!The host was very apologetic for our extended wait and treated us to a round of oysters. Â We were given one of the very best tables in the house right next to the kitchen. Â Our waiter was funny, prompt and even brought Stephanie Izard to our table to introduce her. Â She did the ""Goat Dance"" for us and we were ammused! Â What a talented chef--maybe not so much with the dance, but her dishes were OUTSTANDING!I really didn't think I could be EXCITED about green beans with fish sauce and I raised an eyebrow when our waiter said that was one of the house favorites. Â G&G's green beens are the Rolls Royce of beans. Â The softshell crab was to die for. Â By far, one of the most enjoyable dining experiences I've had in awhile."
"Tip: Â  reservations may be hard to get last min, but they have open bar seating and lounge first come first serve with full menu service. Â So if you're not in a hurry, come and you'll find a spot at the bar Â or put your name down for a table. Â  We were a group of three on a saturday night and found seats within 15 mins, Â they quoted us 2-3 hours for an actual table but one opened within an hour (however we were already well on our way to eating at the bar already).Food was delicious ! Â  Prices are high for the small portions but you get quality!!My fav that night was the chickpea with fritters and the pig face. Â  And don't skip on the bread, the homemade butter was to die for."
"Hype factor is kind of high here. The food was good but was nowhere near the level of awesomeness that I was expecting based on the other reviews. For example, the goat flatbread was nice but not extraordinary. The cauliflower with mint was exactly what the name implies...pretty simple to do at home.The drinks were interesting and the service was good. It was a little loud but that's too be expected. We didn't have reservation and waited about 1.5hours early on a Saturday evening. I appreciate that they even take walk-ins. All in all - this place was good but not even close to great."
"Who needs another review of Girl & the Goat, I know... but I'm gonna go there.After making reservations a month and a half in advance, we were treated to an absolutely fantastic meal. I steered clear of reviews for this place out of a need to not be negatively influenced by all the nay-sayers of any ""celebrity"" restaurant, so imagine my surprise when I realized everything was small plate. I'm not normally a fan of family-style or small plate establishments, but Girl & the Goat had me at ""Sweet Potato au Gratin"". If you order nothing else, please order this dish. And if they don't have it on the menu the night you dine there, mayhaps you should think about speaking with the management.The only reason this place isn't receiving 5 stars in my book is because of the decor: Overwhelmingly tacky/trippy art school painting hovering over the dining room? Check! And let's not forget about the earnest mid-90's playlist that accompanies your meal.I'll always think of Natalie Merchant and Counting Crows whilst chowing down hastily-homemade plate of sweet potato au gratin."
"I don't like to think of myself as a person who waits 3 months for a restaurant reservation, but apparently I am, because I waited that long to eat at G&GT-- but the experience was well worth the wait.There's something like 1,300 reviews of this restaurant on yelp.com right now so there's likely no need for me to get into the nitty-gritty of the ambiance and the great waiters, etc., as to be honest, there better be great ambiance and top notch waiters at a venue like this. If there isn't, then you're back to eating at just any other gastropub in Anytown, USA... that said, a few pointers:1) The pig-face is overrated. Cute name, nice presentation, but by the time it came out I couldn't look another dish in the face(pun intended).2) Some of the best dishes we had haven't really been mentioned on yelp- namely, the cod cheeks. Get these. They are basically the best fish and chips you've ever had in your life, multiplied by 1,000,000 and then cubed. Just get them. 3) Ask your waiter what she/he likes. Our waiter (a lovely girl who's name I am sad to have forgotten) suggested we get the mussels which were another amazing choice, one that really gets easily ignored on a menu of items including 'goat belly', 'cod cheeks' and 'pig face'. Anyway, they are simple, exquistely done and all in all, a home-run. The scallops were also phenomenal- probably the best we'd had in a while. The green beans are everyone's favorite-- and for good reason, they taste nothing like green beans. No clue what they do to them but we essentially licked the bowl clean.4)Try to save room for dessert, as the various options (including cheeses) are all amazing. Who knew you could accompany chocolate mousse with foie gras? And Kudos to Steph for partnering with the best gelato in Chicago( Black Dog Gelato)"
"Waited outside to finish a smoke, called to see how long of a wait for 2. Was put on hold, finished my smoke and walked in. Hostess was just standing there doing nothing. Why was I put on hold?!?! That's enough to put me off and NOT want to actually try their food!"
"I wish I had liked this place better.I was in town for a conference from San Francisco, and I made my reservation a month in advance. Â I was SO excited to come here!Well, it was fine, but will I come back, next time I'm in Chicago?Doubtful.Lots of little things subtracted from our experience, which ultimately made us kind of disappointed in the overall meal. Pluses- service was great, and we were happy with the wine advice. Â Room is pretty cool, and we liked the space & atmosphere overall. Food & wine menus are interesting, and there were lots of things we wanted to try.Based on the service and potential for the future, I will make this 3 star review, not 2. To start off, we had a 9:45pm reservation. Â We were spot on time, but we ended up waiting nearly 30 minutes for our table. Â They were extremely cordial and apologetic. Â And they did send us out an extra plate to make up for it, but well, by 11pm at night, there was only so much food we could eat. Â The gesture was appreciated but lost on us.On to the food:The Girl & the Goat branding was pretty fierce- goats were everywhere- --- but on my plate.Because when we went to order?They were all out of goat.Really? Â I came all this way, and you're sold out?Horrible disappointment. Epic failure. Â We did console ourselves with the very delicious, but very small order of goat/pork/veal sugo. Â For $16? Really? Â I expected more than the portion we received. Speaking of $16, we also paid that much for our crudo, which was laughable in the size. Â It was 3 bites.Other items were good, but somehow, they just kind of each felt short- either just slighty too salty or 1 too many ingredients. Â The too small sugo was the best part about our meal. Despite our up/down experience, we still wanted tshirts for souvenirs. I was shown my options and agreed to the girl/goat love tshirt. I had purchased a shirt at the Purple Pig the night before for $20 and assumed it would be a similar price point.Had I known they were $30 each, I wouldn't have bothered. Â And it wasn't until I got home that I realized I had been sold the wrong tshirt. Â II ended up getting the one about not feeding beer to goats. Â Not the end of the world, but not my first choice. Girl & the Goat- I think you have the makings of a great restaurant. Â But I honestly think you have some editing to do.Maybe pull back on the branding, lose the corporate polish.Add some more heart, and stop trying so hard.....Maybe I'll see you again, maybe next time I'll stick to Purple Pig & Publican."
"While the food is fantastic, it is not worth going back because of the lack of customer service at this restaurant. Â We planned a nice night out for my sister's birthday and from the start we weren't treated the way you would expect to be. The hostess ignored us for 45 minutes while our table was empty; it took us a while to place our drink order, and when the bus boy poured water in my glass of wine the waitress had a little trouble offering me another. Â To top off the evening, when we went to pay the bill, the waitress accidentally charged the whole amount (7 people, 3 bottles of wine, do the math) on my card without Â notifying me or giving me a voided recepiet. Â That evening, I checked my account and was out a huge amount of money the week of Christmas! Â I called the restaurant repeatedly and they understood the incoveience but found it difficult to offer me any peace of mind. I soon realized that this place does not value their customer service, I will not be returning afraid they will charge my card on accident. Â I feel this restaurant is more concerned with the food than the value of their customer."
"Delicious, delicious, delicious.Now that being said, be prepared to drop some cash, but you will remember this meal for a long time. Â Although our long-awaited reservation was during the week (this past Tuesday) at 6:30, the place looked like it was prime time on a weekend night. Â The green beans w/fish sauce and almonds were worth the nine bucks. Â My husband (normally an anti-veggie guy) and I were fighting over licking the plate clean. Â  The hamachi crudo (with some very devour-worthy pork belly) was amazing (albeit a very small portion, I want more!). Â  We also dug the escargot ravioli, and the lamb sausage stuffed calamari was EXCELLENT. Â The goat empanada - so very good, I am getting hungry again just writing this. Â Don't forget to order some bread; $4 bread, you wonder? Â We had a chive sauce and roasted tomato butter to go with it, great stuff.And finally, then there was dessert (which I am not a sweet tooth so really jumped at a savory end to my meal!) - hello pork fat donuts!All in all, it was a really fun night. Â The wine was good; my husband loved the beer selections that our server suggested. Â I would definitely go back!"
"This is probably my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. I've been there twice and everything was perfect both times. The ambience is intimate but not overly formal or pretentious. The service matches the exceptional food. I'd recommend going with a group of 6. It is a shared plates restaurant, so a group of this size means more food to try! A group any larger and it would be difficult for everyone to try each of the plates ordered. Branch out of your comfort zone - the pig face was amazing! Also, don't avoid the vegetables - these will be the best vegetables you have ever tasted!"
"Served to share, brought out when ready, in an awesome midwest-chic atmosphere (except the music was too loud and didn't fit the restaurant's vibe). lots of fish and meat, even on the 'vegetable' menu, so not good for strict vegetarians. definitely worth trying; good place for a special occasion. great service."
"My wife and I stopped by Girl and the Goat the other day without reservations, expecting to be turned away. Â Luckily, the baby's early bed time forces us to look for meals shortly after 5:00pm, and we managed to just sneak in before the rush. Â The menu was fresh and creative, and the service staff was friendly and knowledgeable. Â We put ourselves in their capable hands, and ended up with a series of tapas style dishes that complemented one another and showed off the breadth of the kitchen's capabilities. Â We will definitely be coming back sans-baby for a fuller night of it, including their large selection of beverages."
"Tip: Â Go even without a reservation because the bar: Â easy to find a seat; provides excellent entertainment; and rocked the cock(tails)....Baa Baa Black Sheep, Have You Any Wool?No Sir, No Sir, But Damn, I'm Full...I just ate at Girl and the Goat for a second time and am stuffed.Cocktails: Â Three Under Par & Dark and StormyAppetizers: Raw Oysters and Grilled OystersDinner: Â Smoked Ribs (OMFG GOOD), Ham Frites (I'll invent a new word for this delish devilish delight), and Parmesan Peppers.Dessert: Â Blue Cheese Gelato (Thanks, Black Dog!) with peaches and some spicy, savory, crunchy topping.Aperitif: Â Ash Smash (tequila never had it so good)."
"I've been here twice and thoroughly enjoyed it both times. Â Having gone in a group of 6 and with just one other person, I recommend coming with more people- you can try more stuff! Â Loved: roasted cauliflower, ham frites (although only with a big group, you get tired of them after a while), halibut, goat/pork/veal sugo... Â and last time they had a goat empanada that was to die for. Â I'm not sure it's worth waiting three months to get in, but once you do get in it is a great experience.Not as crazy about: scallops, hiramasa crudo with pork belly.Just go. Â Try as much as you can. Â You won't be disappointed."
"I have been wanting to go here since I moved to Chicago, and waited three months for my reservation to become a reality, and...IT WAS EVEN BETTER THAN I IMAGINED!First of all, the ambiance is amazing - everyone is SUPER friendly, from the hostesses to the waitstaff to the chefs, and while it's definitely a really nice restaurant it doesn't feel cold or unwelcoming or too hoity toity. Secondly, somehow my friend and I were seated at the chef's table!!! I have a feeling it was sort of an accident but we were SOOO excited.Thirdly, they have a GREAT beer selection - apparently they are pretty friendly with Three Floyds so you can get the most recent brews.And finally....THE FOOD. Since we were seated at the chef's table, we ordered four dishes and they gave us four more so we tried a LOT of things - 1. Green beans - very delightful indeed, and the fish sauce was not too fishy (which I was worried about) 2. Pig face - this is definitely delicious, but it's also extremely rich, so i could really only take a few bites of it. It's unique though so you should definitely order it. 3. Scallops - excellent. Must try. 4. Grilled oysters - simple but absolutely astounding. One of my favorite dishes we tried. 5. Cauliflour - who would have thought it could be such an exciting vegetable?! they do it up here with spices, butter and mint and it's really divine. Better than the green beans in my opinion. 6. Ribs - REALLY good and smoky. A bit dry for me. 7. Grilled baby octopus - I loved these but they actually (wince) weren't the best I've ever had. They were a little chewy. 8. Veal pork and goat sugo - YOU MUST GET THIS. delicious and warm and comforting and soooo yummy. Probably my favorite. To top it all off, we ordered the blood sorbet with pistachio cake and all sorts of other fun stuff - it was incredible.AND to round out our perfect meal, we met both the owner (SUCH a nice guy) AND Stephanie, who is my foodie idol so I was pretty much in absolute food bliss.I will be reliving this high for a while...."
"I would like to know what everyone see's in this place? I know, Stephanie was on Top Chef, and belive me, that is it! My husband and I went there with another couple, had 11 items on the menu (meaning a large portion of the menu) and every single one of them had a sauce on it! Why? What are they trying to hide? We felt sick when we left, not because we were really full, but from all the ""richness"" of all the sauces! Can you say overkill? The fish and chips were soooo greasy, it was like eating at Long John, you know the rest of that name! The decor was nice, but that is where it ends for me. This city is full of great restaurants, and this is not one of them! Don't waste your time and money. Who cares that she was on Top Chef, that doesn't make it good. Will not go back!"
"broccoli was the best ive ever had, the scallops where also ridiculous, this place is doing it right. Â  LOVE IT"
"This is a fun spot to visit from out of town. I don't know if I'd be a regular, but is definitely worth a stop. Our favorites were the kohlrabi salad and ham frites. It's definitely jammed (even at 10pm on Sunday night), so make sure you don't arrive starving..."
"The bf took me here a couple weeks ago for our anniversary & i was super excited because i am big fan of Top Chef and was looking forward to finally eat @ The Girl and the Goat. we started off with the choco loco bread, our server noted that the bread was baked fresh daily. the bread had a really interesting flavor with a hint of chocolate, rustic but very tasty with the spread that was served with it. i liked how the menu is set up with small plates because we were able to try a little bit of everything; our server reccomended that about 4-5 small plates would be good for us. so we went with the sweet potato gratin, seared scallops, smoked goat pizza & the skirt steak. our food was served pretty quickly & the smoked goat pizza came out first and it was pretty big portion, i'm kind of picky but i was open to trying the goat meat..the flavors with the cheese and meat were really good and something different. the seared scallops were really good it had fresh vegetables and pumpkin seeds, our server also made note of my nut allergy and i appreciated the fact that when the food was expedited they made sure there were no nuts in the dish. i think our favorite dish was the skirt steak..the beets and all the vegetables that were in the dish were sooo delicious & the meat was cooked perfectly. we almost wanted to order a second serving of it! we ended our meal with the bittersweet chocolate cake topped with shitake gelato..i thought the gelato might taste weird since i never really thought of having something with mushrooms for dessert. the dessert was actually very yummy though had the perfect balance of sweet and savory flavors. =)  Â overall we had a great experience at girl & the goat..the ambience with the fireplace and layout is really nice. the service is really great too & i appreciated all the reccomendations that our server made since it was our first time dining there. when we ordered the smoked goat pizza he noted that it would count for about a dish and a half, so i appreciated that he didn't want us to over order. he even asked us if we wanted to take a photo/meet stephanie izzard but then realized she wasn't there for the evening..so i guess we'll have to go back and hopefully we'll run into her next time we dine there!!! =)"
"One of the top five meals I have ever had and definitely one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. The crudo, mussels, and goat carpaccio blew my mind. And the oysters were amazing. We'll be back in 3 months when we get a reservation."
"I will go all out and say that is the best food I have EVER had, and I am a foodies, so that says a lot... Fantastic menu, creative choices, everything is cooked to perfection, the goat especially, so juicy and tender to the fork alone (no need for a knife, really), great wine selection, friendly service. Not sure how polite or ""with it"" the front door staff is, however we went here for the food and that did not disappoint!!!! I would go back here in a heartbeat for more..."
"By far, the best meal I've had in Chicago!This place is absolutely incredible. Â The atmosphere is excellent and the service second to none. Â I can't say enough good things!We ordered the pork shank, green beans, goat empanadas, and kona kompachi crudo. Â Each dish was utter perfection!"
"I celebrated my birthday here and it was a delicious experience. Â The menu is nicely varied and they take great care to serve your dishes in the best order to suit your palette. Â If you've wanted to try this place, make a reservation a few months in advance. Â It's worth the wait."
"Wow this place is the bomb! Had my bachelorette dinner here with my girlfriends. We love everything we ate, the flavors were just so amazing and unique. Yes it's hard to make a reservation, but it's so worth it! I'll be back Girl & The Goat and can't wait to try everything you have on your menu."
"My coworkers said this place is great, and Yelp reviews are great. The only way I could eat there is to eat at the bar if I got there at opening time. Apparently you have to wait month if you were to make a reservation for a table. Sure enough, place had people waiting even though they were not open yet. In any case, I was able to get a seat at the bar.The place has some unique dishes on the menu, which is what I wanted to taste. First thing I had was Wood Fired Wiley Oysters with a hint of bacon and horseradish. Delicious. My second dish was Confit Goat Belly with Bourbon Butter, Lobster and Crab, Fennel and a few other spices. OMFG! Goat belly is not as fatty as pork belly, soft enough to cut with a fork, butter was superb and a bite of goat belly, lobster dipped in butter was absolutely wonderful. The last thing I had was Wood Roaster Pig Face on top of super skinny potato sticks, red wine-maple sauce and various spices. This goodness was topped off with a sunny side-up egg. You have to chop everything up so that egg yoke gets all over the place. Let me tell you folks... my love for pig parts has been strengthened. Every bite had the crunch of deliciously prepared pig face with more crunch from the potato sticks and creaminess of the egg and sauce. I don't want to be dramatic here, but this dish is possibly life changing. I am sitting here hours later, writing this and still savoring the aftertaste of the last dish.If you live in Chicago then you're a fool for not trying this place. So get off your butt and make a reservation. If you're visiting Chicago then run, do not walk, RUN to this place."
"I hate to put a damper on things, but it was just okay. Maybe it was the hype, maybe it was the amount of time we had to wait to get a non early bird reservation time.The service was great, the wine list satisfying, but the food left us talking. If I had to pick one thing that knocked my socks off, it would be be the cauliflower. Â The ribs were really fatty, the rest was pretty unmemorable. I guess I'd go back for a drink and a snack, but probably not for dinner."
Everything was medium. Server was above medium.
"Just as good as everyone says it is. Everything was perfect- service, food, drinks, dessert. Will be back again."
"With all the hype I expected to be disappointed. Â Instead, i was amazed. Â The food is consistently creative, inventive, and flavorful. Â Some of the dishes are simple, and some very complex, but all have been carefully thought through and really sparkle. Â Wine list is solid. Â We sat at the bar, which was great. Â An absolute foodie must."
"The only thing I would change if I were to go again would be to have a bigger stomach. Â My eyes were way to big for my belly size and I wanted to order one of everything.The service was extra friendly and were obviously trained to be so but it was still refreshing and I let my suspension of disbelief take over and I could not be more pleased that I did. Â The atmosphere was very pleasant with many wood features and their goat image made several appearances from their walls to the cutting boards. Â My favorite parts were the wall that appeared to be made of burnt railroad ties and the painted on the right wall when you walking in. Â The music was on the louder side but they played an enjoyable mix.The food was outstanding! Â We started of with two breads: the amazing and the coffee style! Â Both the breads were very good but it was the sauces/spreads that made them fantastic. Â Either bread could be put in either sauce and it was still great. Â We had an all-veggie meal and I was surprised by both their variety and quantity of tasty veggie plates. Â We started with the olives which went well with the bread followed by a beat salad that was crunchy and delicious. Â Then we had parmesan cauliflower, which I was sold on. Â Honestly until that meal I have never liked cauliflower in anything but the server said it was one of their best dishes and it changed my view on cauliflower. Â The highlight of the meal for me was the artichoke pasta, the layers of flavors left me asking for me .. in my head I was already getting full at this point. Â We finished the meal with the Thai chili chocolate gelato which can only be described as heavenly. Â Just by the name you know you are in for something amazing - and it was a unique blend of sweet, spicy, and outstanding. Â I wish I was still hungry at the end of the meal so that I could have ordered another!Girl and the Goat does not need my review with so many fantastic reviews already written, but it truly deserves it! Â 5+"
"Lots of hype over this place. Lot of reviewers had some good advice that I will steal in this review.1. Everything is a bit on a fatty side. Some things tasted better than others.2. Not a wine drinker. Beer selection was good - craft beers.3. Some dishes had different names - pig face, beef tongue. When meals arrived, they were served with numerous other flavors and spices, and in forms that did not resemble original shape. It could have been any part of any animal. 4. In summary, according to my taste:Meats - greasy, OK.Veggie dishes - excellentSeafood - good, not greatBread - ExcellentDesert - Very goodService was good, Decor was great. Place was crowded, but they were nice enough not to cram as many tables as possible in the space. So I never felt that I was sharing the experience with strangers next to us.It was a good experience. But for the price, I would probably not go back."
"Gorgeous space in west loop with beautiful bar area & exposed beams overhead. Loved the paint of the girl & the goat (slightly nightmarish with popping colors), and loved the food! We orderedpeter piper bread - good, wish the bread was biggeralaskan spot prawns - YUM! with balance components & fresh shrimpsauteed green beans - good, never thought that fish sauce can go with beansgrilled baby octopus - ok, slightly toughlamb sausage stuffed calamari - too fishy & lamb-e .goat pork and veal sugo - VERY good, loved the pappardellewood oven roasted pig face - the BEST, wish there were morebraised beef tongue - ok, could be more tenderbourbon apples - LOVE this! imagine apple pie in a cupfudgecicle - ok, too strong for mecocoa nib donuts - YUM with fresh donutsOverall the experience was pleasant with surprising food combination & flavors. I am eager to come back to see what Stephanie will cook up next!"
"Apparently the ""it"" Girl (and Goat) in Chicago at the moment, so I had to drop in. Â Great atmosphere and pleasant service. Â The Jardin cocktail with tequila was divine. Â Wine list relatively reasonable, including options by the glass under $10. Â Food is good and a bit adventuresome, though visual presentation did not earn style points. Â Many of the dishes come out looking the same, but what they lack in appearance and execution is countered by the ambitiousness and variety of the menu options. Â I haven't been excited by so many intriguing options on one menu in awhile. The portions, even for small plates, are generous and easily allow splitting each (of most dishes) 3 to 4 ways. Worth a trip, but I think the overall 4.5 star rating compiled on Yelp is a little too generous. Based upon the execution of the food I sampled alone, 3 stars would be reasonable. Â But the combination of the atmosphere and delectable sounding options combine to justify my 4 star rating.Specifics on the food:The roasted cauliflower, much touted by the staff, fell a bit flat and was not quite interesting to save it from monotony. Â The shishito peppers were interesting, smeared with miso paste and parmesan cheese, but really did not improve upon the most simple and elegant presentations I have had in Japan (grilled with a dusting of sea salt). Â The beef tongue was tender (of course), but forgettable. The pappardelle (with goat, pork and veal) was outstanding, highlighted by sweet unexpected cape goose berry explosions in your mouth- definitely the highlight of what I sampled. Â The sauteed scallops were average- I cannot remember much about them today."
"Small and way too crowded, but fun in spite of that. Â Reservations are a must if you don't want to fight over bar stools and waiting for a table at the bar is just plain annoying. Â Food is creative and delicious. Â Not everything works perfectly, but it is beautifully presented and, at least, very good to outstanding. Â Served ""tapas"" style, it is perfect to share many different bites.There are communal tables and if you are seated at one, you have an opportunity to interact with people from all over. Â That was definitely a highlight as we had some great table mates. Â Take a moment to watch the kitchen work. Â What a finely tuned machine! Â Servers really hustle and do a great job. Â Drinks are good, too.Don't miss the Girls & the Goat if you're in Chicago - but make reservations to avoid what can be a more than two hour wait for a table in an overly packed and cramped bar."
"Vegetarians-- don't let the name of this restaurant fool you. There is PLENTY to eat, and you're going to love it all. It's all served family style so make sure your meat-eater friends leave enough for you because everyone will enjoy it! It's so nice inside. I really felt like I was having a ""Chicago"" dining experience, if you can understand what I mean by that. Who can resist the cute little goat logo that's drawn everywhere? Also, all the food *looks* delicious, which is important. I took pictures of everything we ordered. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating, and will answer any questions you have. All the food is brought out in a timely manner. I didn't feel rushed or like I wanted to get out of there. Get your reservations now! It's worth the wait!"
This place was so good that I even tried the pork belly. Everything was the most delicious thing that I have ever eaten and the drinks were just as fun to try! Order at least three dishes per person.
"We had a reservation here two times that unfortunately we had to cancel, so to finally get to go eat at G&TG was soo exciting! Â It definitely was a delicious meal, but I can't give it that fifth star because it didn't blow my mind if you know what I mean. Â We may have made a few ordering missteps, which is our fault. Â But even so, I am going to stand firm at 4 stars. Â This may sound silly, but the highlight of the menu for me was the ""Not Campbells"" bread. Â It was...amazing. Â It's like a broccoli cheddar soup in bread form, and they serve it with two dipping sauces, which are both incredible. Â We also loved the crudo. Â We got the lobster and goat entree, which was solid, and the pig's face, which was also very good. Â One thing I wouldn't order again was the fries. Â That might seem like a ""duh"" but one similar place I ALWAYS order the fries is The Publican, so I guess we were expecting something similar, and they just don't match up. Â I think if we had ordered another entree, maybe the scallops, or a veggie, the whole meal would have been better. Â But again, that's more our fault than anything. Â Four stars, a great place to treat yourself to a nice dinner!"
"I have dined here a handful of times and it is always great. Most recently we came for the Super Bowl brunch, which was awesome! We had goat chili with hummus, crumpets with kumquat jam, and an oyster po' boy with a fried egg on top. They had a bloody mary 'combo' which was a spicy bloody mary and a can of PBR for $10. Everything was amazing.From my understanding the brunch this Sunday was a one time deal. Â I hope they will change their minds and start offering brunch on a regular basis. The servers are some of the best in Chicago and the space is comfortable. There is a semi-open kitchen so you can watch the talented Chef Izard practice her genius. There is a reason that it is still tough to get a reservation here... it has lived up to and surpassed the hype. Girl and the Goat is a must for any Chicago foodie."
"I like girls. Â And I like goat. Â It stands to reason that I'd like Girl and the Goat.Aside: Maker's 46, FTW! Â Can I gush for just a -couple- moments about how much I loved being in Chicago, where a product like Maker's 46 can -still- be had in a retail establishment months after it's out of stock anywhere I'm aware of in NYC? Â And they used it in an ultra-simple cocktail with demerara, which allowed the base liquor to shine on its own. Â LOVE.Okay - back to Girl and the Goat. Â I have no idea what kind of strings Andrea had to pull to get us reservations, but even -with- our party being on their list, we still ended up waiting at least half an hour more. Â This speaks to the zeal with which diners are trying to get in the door here, and their fervor is well-founded.Decor is somber sexy - almost like a farmhouse version of NYC's Ace Hotel. Â Service is impeccable (or, perhaps that's just a function of Meadows manning our table). Â And food is beyond reproach.Highlights for me were the hiramasa crudo (the crispy pork belly had me bouncing with joy!), ultra-tender short ribs with edamame, and both haricot verte and french fries sides. Â The crudo was so amazing I think I might have polished off a plate and a half by myself. Â Erp.If I lived in the Windy City and had endless funds, you'd find me dining and drinking each and every night away here. Â One could probably eat here every day for an entire week and not make it through the massive variety on the menu."
"RUN!AS FAST AS YOU CAN!TO THIS INCREDIBLE RESTAURANT!Not sure what more needs to be said...but in case you need specifics:The goat, lamb & veal sugo was a life-changer. Â The hiramasa with crispy pork belly was a vision. Â Everyone talks about the green beans with fish sauce and every single person is 100% correct. Â We could not have been more thrilled with everything, from service to food. Â Cannot wait to return!"
"Finally a place that lived up to all the hype. Â Reservations for weekends are booked for 3 months so we decided just to show up early on Friday. Â We had no problem getting a seat at 5:30, and I imagine as long as you show up by 6:30 it won't be too bad.The food is great. Â Chef Izard does a great job of highlighting the freshness of the ingredients while finding flavor combinations that are pleasant without being distracting. Â The beef tongue with masa chips was a wonderful example of how balanced the dishes are. Â The rich and tender meat was sliced thin and cut with plenty of acid from the vinaigrette and contrasted with the crispy masa chips to make each bite interesting. Â Also the fresh baked breads with dipping sauces really warm you up with that first bite.It seems like every new American restaurant is offering a lof of the same dishes and Girl and Goat is no exception. Â But they were exceptional in how well they prepared all those farm fresh ingredients. Â I'm excited to get back."
"The secret to getting a table at girl and the goat? Â Arrive at 5:15 on a Friday with a party of 2 and put your name on the list. Â We grabbed a glass of wine at the lovely (and large) bar/lounge area and were seated by 5:35. Â Had a great early dinner/happy hour here a couple weeks ago. Â 5 star service - our waitress was very knowledgeable and gave great recommendations. Â We ordered the following:breads with sauces - lovelyGreen beans Â - wonderfulChickpeas - amazingpork balls with escargot - deliciousscallops - delectablegoat masala flatbread-- yuck, I did not like this at all, not that it was BAD, it just wasn't to my taste buds, if that makes senseFlatbread notwithstanding, I enjoyed every minute! Â 5 stars for girl and the goat."
"I don't know the girl of which they speak here, or even the goat suggested by the moniker, but I do know this: if you're shoehorning an extended table full of burgeoning food-o-philes (one of whom was in her third trimester and ready to dine fine), I'd recommend Girl and the Goat with the huge, theatrical gestures of the recently full. We ate like kings here, we really did, and the service was exemplary.It's a somewhat modern gestalt at play with semi-industrial touches, and though the room and the bar are somewhat divided, the place tends to play very open concept. This comes in handy when you want to feel like your meal's perhaps more than a meal, or say, an 'occasion' where the time you spend with those at your table is to be remembered. They may not be inventing fire here, but what they do they do quite well. You've likely sorted by this point that dishes tend to come family style and are meant for sharing, and among our samplings I recall a soft spot for the grilled beef short ribs (served with edamame and a scallion vinaigrette) and the ham frittes (which came accented by smoked tomato aioli). Other menu items came and went, and wine, as is it's wont, flowed like meandering conversation. Those are nights when the clocks on the wall wind slow. And come to think of it, why shouldn't they?"
"Miraculously got a last minute reservation at the perfect time before going to see Roger Waters perform The Wall at Wrigley. Â I've looked for reservations to the Goat previously, apparently trying for any amount of advance planning to go to the Goat takes months of planning, as they are that booked. Â last minute appears to be the way to go.We were kind of in a hurry to not miss any of the show, so we didn't indulge too much.We like to aim for the unique menu items we can't likely/easily make at home, and can't find many places.Started with the grilled baby octopus. Â Very tasty, but was more of a salad- lots of things mixed in. Â Not the best grilled octopus I've had. Â Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't not order again (double negative).Braised beef tongue. Â Yum-o. Â Served with thin & crispy masa.Goat belly confit (which i believe is a method of food peservation done in fat). Â Very good, but an incredibly small portion. Â For a small plate that's meant to be shared, me and wifey each had less than a single bite. Â Hard to make judgement when you don't really get a good taste.Had the green beans, which had a sort of creamy vinagrette. Â Probably some of the best green beans I've ever had.Finished with the famous pig face. Â It's not really the whole face, just a slab of dark meat, served with a sunny egg, meant to be mixed in to make a sauce. Â If you love your pork fat as much as we do, the pig face is definitely a don't miss dish.I hope people don't mind me looking at what they order, because I do it all the time. The table next to us got the pork shank. Â I would absolutely get get the pork shank next time. Â A large hunk of bone-in pork, crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside. Â The Goat had a good feel to it. Â Comfortable. Â A little noisy but manageable.Fairly pricy.I would definitely go back."
"We called in January for a Saturday night reservation and got mid-April. Â The menu was all appetizers but don't call them tapas. Â And the distinction between veggie dishes and fish or meat is merely ""focus"". Â One of our party was surprised by the fish sauce on a vegetable dish ... I was caught off guard by the seared tuna having veal sausage on it. Everything we tried was very salty and had smoke flavor. Â It felt like Sex and the City met the New York Housewives for dinner. Â In fact there was an abnormal number of all female tables. Â It was nice to have been."
"After waiting for three months for our 4:30 pm reservation, I was slightly disappointed with Girl and Goat. Â Don't get me wrong, I really enjoyed what I was eating, but after all the hype, I was waiting for the most delicious meal. Let's just say, I wouldn't be begging for goat belly everyday of my life.We ate the pig's face, confit goat belly, scallops, green beans, and fried shisito peppers. The pig's face was very good, definitely a breakfasty dish with egg, grits, and pork. The green beans were also really good, and much bigger portion than we anticipated. The scallops were cooked to perfection. The goat belly had a texture similar to pot roast -- very stringy but tasty. We actually ordered the peppers right before we got our check because the table next to us ordered them. They were also good, but a little salty.All in all, it was very good, but not something I want to eat everyday or salivate thinking about. I don't know if it was worth the three month wait."
"Love this place! As a pescatarian, I have ample options at this place. Favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. Get their cauliflower dish... I know it sounds like... ew, cauliflower?... but trust me, it's sooo good."
"I thought the Girl and the Goat was fantastic. The scene was a bit loud, even for a Saturday night, but we were with a large group and also loud so it worked. The food was for the most part fantastic. This is especially true for the leg of goat which was out of this world. (FYI it must be ordered in advance but totally worth a little planning) There was a high level of excitement by the staff for the introduction of goat leg which also added to the entertainment of the night. The service was above average and our seats were right in front of the kitchen which was fun and exciting. We all got to see Stephanie do her thang, and dinner was even capped off nicely with several pics with Stephanie and the group, including one with me boning her. Well OK bone fighting with the goat leg bones. Definitely check this place out!"
"For those of you who've been living under a rock & another heavier rock, the Girl and the Goat is a ""hot spot"" restaurant in Chicago. Â It's owner, Stephanie Izzard, was one of the winners of the television show Top Chef (I don't remember which season.... sorry, that's too much to ask of me).Now, I should note, this restaurant is not for those on a budget. Â You will spend this month's rent eating at GAG (as my daughter likes to refer to it). The space is dark and brooding, which is actually kinda cool... the noise of patrons conversing and the thump, thump, thump of loud background music better suited to those younger than I, fills the air.Our waitress, Monika, was terrific, attentive and more than helpful. Â She walked us through the menu, and suggested some wonderful items. Â Their menu is broken into three parts, V-for Vegetables... F-for Fish... and M-for, you guessed it, those things with Meat. Monika was so good, in fact, that she even laughed at a couple of my jokes.So, let's see.. what did we eat? ... Monika recommended we start with approximately 2 dishes per person... so with the five of us, that was 10 dishes, (You see how quickly I calculated that, right in my head!?) since GAG offers small plates (ala tappas-style) for everyone at the table to share.The serving staff was so attentive, I began to refer to them as ""attack waiters""... when they saw a glass was less than full, they swooped in like a Ninja... quickly poured more water, and just as swiftly backed away. Â Make sure you aren't between them and the water glass... you could lose an eye! Â Here's what we ate:STARTING WITH THE VEGETARIAN OFFERINGS:* chickpeas fritters with eggplant-tomatillo caponata and crave brother's mozzarella. The tiny little sample that I had was delicious... I would have liked a bit more.* roasted beets with green beans and white anchovy on a layer of avocado creme fraiche. Â I'm not a big fan of beets, but this was tasty, and there was ample to share.* sauteed green beans in a fish sauce vinaigrette with cashews. This was a larger bowl, easily shareable at the table. Â The fish sauce was a bit bright, but delicious. Â It was not a favourite of the table, but it was my favourite of the evening.* squash blossom rangoon stuffed with crab, chive yogurt and little toasted almonds spread around. There were four little blossoms, stuffed with crab and yogurt... very tasty, but by the time you divided them for the five of us, just a little taste.ON TO THE FISH PORTION OF THE MENU:* seared scallops, smoked goat, spiced cantaloupe and coconut-cucumber salad. There were two large scallops, which we surgically dissected into eight tiny pieces, so that everyone could have a bite. Â I think my bite was delicious... at least I think I remember that it was...* steamed clams with tarragon, fermented black beans and a tiny Chinese cruller. Â That's right... a cruller, to soak up some of the lovely juices. Â There were only five tiny clams... one for each of us. Â I have the feeling there are ordinarily only four, but our waitress told the kitchen... hey, they're sharing this with five people... c'mon, gimme one more. Â Very tasty, and we dipped our soft-pretzel bread into the juices multiple times.* pan roasted wild striped bass with sea beans and truffle-poblano vinaigrette. Â This was not one of my favourites, but it was the favourite of everyone else at the table. Â Nice pieces of bass, sitting in a vinaigrette sauce, with sea beans (tiny, thin twisted little gems of flavour). I thought the bass was bland, but everything it was sitting in was tasty.* soft shell crab I don't remember all the ingredients on this one, and I can't find it on their website... but it was tender little pieces of crab, floating in a delectable broth, and we all took turns dipping into it with bread, and forks. Â Excellent.AND WE ARRIVE AT THE MEAT PORTION:* goat chorizo flatbread w/peppers, green tomato, apricot and fresh ricotta. Â This was a small pizza-like dish. Â Oblong, and divided into 8 pieces, and crunch and delicious, the goat wasn't dramatically noticeable, but the chorizo was flavourful and spicy. Â Just as it should be.* wood oven roasted pig face covered by a sunny-side egg with tamarind, cilantro and potato stix. This was touted as their signature dish. Â I half expected to find a little ""face"" staring up at us from the plate, but it was more of a patty, covered by a familiar sunny-side egg, and with tiny little hash-brown-esque potato sticks spread randomly around the plate. Â The ladies took a bite, and felt it was a bit too ""greasy"" for the, but my son-in-law and I thoroughly enjoyed this one... egg and all. Â Very smokey, very ""porky"", but quite good.When the meal was over (was I full? not stuffed, but not hungry either... I guess I was)... we shared a couple of pleasant, but forgettable desserts, over some delicious Intelligensia coffees (GAG has it's own blend), including the decaf, which was rich, full & flavorful."
"Of course there's quite a lot of hype surrounding this restaurant but sadly it didn't live up to it. The space is comfortable and high energy. The service I think is top notch. Unfortunately the Â dished didn't work. We ordered a broad range of plates including cauliflower, green beans, pork shank, chicken, shrimp, goat, and more. My impression is that whatever subtleties of flavor and spices were intended for the food we tried were drowned out by an overuse of salt. Really, really wanted to love it."
"Do you like over-priced food that you can get for less money at better tasting restaurants? If so, then this place is for you!!!"
"Go get your goat on!My husband and I have a little crush on the ever-so-talented Top Chef Stephanie, and so we decided to go for an early dinner (4:45 pm) at The Girl and The Goat last night. Â We were early enough we didn't need reservations. Â Turned out great - we were seated at one of the chef's tables and got to watch the whole kitchen line during the evening. Â (So orderly and efficient!) Â Unfortunately, no Stephanie sighting, but we'll be back!The Food - excellent savory, surprising flavor combinations, with sort of umami grooves. Â We had (listed in order of LOVE) the 1) goat, veal and pork sugo with pappardelle, rosemary, and cape gooseberries (the berries sealed the deal), 2) dessert of bittersweet chocolate cake with shitake gelato and toffee creme fraiche, and 3) kabocha squash ravioli, with mushroom raisin ragout, brussels leaves, shroom creme fraiche. Â The skirt steak and wood-fired oysters were very good, too. We heard from other diners at the chef's table that the roasted pig face, goat pizza, lamb shanks and scallops are not to missed - future trip!The Service - I LOVED the service! Â Knowledgeable, very attentive without hovering, organized. Â I am not a downtowner or hipster cool cat, and so I appreciated our server's down-to-earth friendliness as well. The Ambiance - felt like an urban loft that was not overly stainless-steel-ized. Â They use wood and muted browns and grays for a warm effect. Â Love the painting of the girl and the goat in the front room. Â Reminds me of some of the fantastical, colorful art in the Wishbone restaurants. Â Prices: Tasting plates, so go with friends and order plenty! Â For the two of us we ordered an appetizer, 3 plates, and dessert. Â Another plate would have been good. Â Average plate is between $10 -$15. Â Desserts $8. Â Parking: Â We found free street parking, which was probably luck. Â They do have valet for $10."
"What can I say about this place that hasn't already been said. Â We went right at opening and swooped a spot at the bar. Â The bartender was awesome, and the food was amazing. I'll jump on the bandwagon and offer two words... ""Pig Face"". It'll be in my thoughts from time to time until I get a chance to get back to Chicago."
"Based on other reviews, I expected a wait even though we made reservations a couple months in advance. We were pleasantly surprised to be seated promptly. We liked the loftiness of the restaurant and although the larger than life painting of a girl and her goal didn't seem to fit in with the dark wood, I found myself continually looking at the painting and found it a nice touch. Our party of two ordered the: Pig Face Green Beans Fried Oysters Pork Shank Goat Belly Orange Sorbet The Pig Face was amazing with a melt in your mouth feel combined very nicely with the gooey sunny side up egg mixture. I hesitated on ordering the green beans because it's something I can make any day...obviously I forgot I'm not a top chef! My friends warned me the food there is salty and the green beans indeed were but it wasn't overwhelming and gave a simple dish such as green beans a nice kick. The fried oysters with an egg salad mixture was also perfection because of the combined taste and freshness of the oysters. Although the goat belly and pork shank were good, it wasn't any thing outside of the ordinary and left us with a slight regret of not ordering something different. We ended the night with the orange sorbet in which I kept on scraping the bottom of the bowl in hopes the dessert would never end. Our waitress was also very patient with explaining the menu to us and jumped right over when she saw our look of confusion with how to eat the pig face. I'm sure we were the 3rd or 4th table she waited at but never lost her cool and provided great service. Our water glasses also rarely hit the midway mark and we found it cute that even if the waiters were juggling plates on their arms, they still walked over and acrobatically filled up our glass. Definitely a place I look forward to returning to!"
GO!!!!!!!! thats all I have to say about that
"There is a two person table facing the kitchen that my girlfriend and I were lucky enough to sit at. Â The location allowed for us to interact with the cooks as they made the food. Â What this means is that we had an amazing dinner that no other patron can match.The food was amazing a little heavy but just what we were looking for. Â I'd recommend the tuna and lamb sausage as well as the ribs, both were incredible. Â The kitchen staff was lively and up-beat which made for a unique experience. Â I would like to thank Norbert and the other two cooks for giving us a very memorable evening."
"Great night out. The food is good, but more fun was sitting at the 2 seater table in front of the grill. We watched every dish be prepared, tried most things, and talked to the cooks when they're weren't too busy. You can buy reservations to this place if you know where to look..."
"Just had dinner with my family here and thought I'd add yet another review of this Â ridiculously popular restaurant (I mean a 3 month wait???) Â I couldn't wait to try it!Okay... Great looking place. Comfortable and casual atmosphere. We got seated at a table near the window away from the crowd. (yay!) The waiter was very nice, helpful and attentive.We ordered a bottle of Pinot noir - delicious! Since there were 7 of us, we got several dishes to share: shank, trout, chicken, Skatefish, ribs, and veggies. Everything was excellent! However.... I just felt the portion sizes were way too small. I'm not a big person and don't eat a lot, but the waiter suggested I order two dishes, a chicken dish and a fish dish along with a side of veggies (that should tell you something). I hate to admit it, but I could have definitely eaten more! When we got home, my sons immediately made something to eat. Not something you expect after spending a few hundred dollars on a meal! (A nice touch might be FREE bread.) Again, great food, great service, but don't go there starving unless you plan on ordering multiple dishes!"
"The only reason it gets four stars as opposed to five is that Each of the 5 times I've been there, Ive had to wait a lot longer than they told me I've had to wait. And it can get to be a little annoying when you've got more than 4 people in your party. It seems like of you were going with a big group that they'd want to make everyone in the group happy so they'd come back. If you absolutely had to delegate and prioritize tasks and think a 2-person table deserves a little less attention (as unfortunate as it may sound) than a larger table. Like if you had the opportunity to impress 8 people or 2 people... who would you choose?"
"WOWZERS! Â This was definitely one of my favorite meals that I've ever had. Â I made reservations here while on a recent vacation to Chicago, and it paid off in spades. Â We made walk-in reservations and even though there was a two hour wait on a Tuesday, it was well worth every second spent waiting and it was a pleasant wait down the street at Haywood Brewery. Â The decor could not have been better - the server said it was called ""rustic badass"". Â It was modern and beautiful without being impersonal. Â The server recommended 4 dishes between two people and every dish was perfectly space and more delicious than the first. Â 1. Oysters - 4 oysters lightly seasoned with a little bit of bacon. Â Delicious!2. Sauteed green beans - so flavorful and the fish sauce and cashews gave it a very distinctive flavor.3. goat's belly - My first time having this dish and it was excellent4. wood oven roasted pig face - Wow, sort of like a very well executed hash and was incredible.Dessert - The brown sugar cake was excellent.I was shocked when I saw the bill that for two people with 5 dishes (no alcohol) plus the dessert it came to just under $100. Â I was already in such a blissful state by that time that I was amazed how reasonably priced it was. Â The only negative experience was that the restaurant was closed for closed the next 2 evenings of labor day and we couldn't go again!"
"I am not someone who likes going where all the ""cool kids"" congregate, I actually try to avoid places that are trendy, elite, and are all the buzz. Â But it was a Saturday date night and my boyfriend surprised me with this place, and I'm not the type of girl that turns that down. Â We did not have a reservation, and I would suggest NOT following in our footsteps. Â We were told it would be a 2.5 hour wait (which we were prepared for) and chose to take a stroll around the West Loop area to work up our appetite. I will say that the biggest strike against this place is how pushy everyone was to get us to eat at the bar. Â We were asked when we put our name in twice, then again when we checked back in, then when we decided to get a drink we were asked by two cocktail servers and the bartender. Â I get it...you want me to eat at the bar, but I don't want to and I will gladly wait for a table. Â Luckily our wait was only 1.5 hours (yes I realize that is still crazy long). Â Due to hearing that this was the ""it place"" to go and the pushiness of the staff I was not thrilled with my experience thus far, but that all did a 180 as soon as we were seated. Â Enter our fabulous server Brennan. Â He was like our own personal entertainment, making us laugh and feel warm & fuzzy inside. Â Also, when we sat down we were able to take in the very cool setting with exposed brick, intimate lighting, and lots of attention to decorative details. Good service can only get you so far, but we were not disappointed because the food was ah-mazing. Â I have to say that I was genuinely blown away by how good it was. Â This is a small plates joint and I am usually not a fan of that, but these small plates are not so tiny. Â We enjoyed the following and left in a very happy food coma:* Corny goat bread with corn relish and goat cheese spread: I seriously could have just ordered two of these and gone home a happy camper* Scallops with braised veal: my least favorite but still good*Fried Soft Shell Crab: ridiculously yummy* Smoked Goat Pizza: melted in my mouth and I cried a single tear when it was all gone*Dessert (changes often) was this layered concoction of ginger cake, blueberry compote, goat cheesecake, creme brulee topping, and granola: it was the perfect finale for the eveningLessons learned: make a reservation, order all of the above, and don't give into to pushy staff that wants you to sit in the bar (table service was totally worth the wait)."
"This review is a little late coming and I am sure that by no means am I breaking any new ground here. But the restaurant is so worth eating at that I feel compelled to share my experience. My girlfriend and I traveled to Chicago in mid-October (2011) to visit the city for the first time. Having worked at a concierge service I knew about this restaurant coming from Toronto, but as soon as I knew we were going (about a month and a half ahead) I went online to make reservations. The best I could get for 2 people was 10-10:30pm on a Thursday. Regardless, I was super stoked to go to Chicago, for various reasons, but being a foodie visiting this restaurant was a big box I wanted to check off my list. We tried to get to the restaurant a bit earlier to see if we could squeeze in anywhere, but that was a no-go, so we saddled up to the stand-up part of the bar because the actual bar area and main floor were packed. My anticipation was building. I tried to discreetly take photos without looking like a douchey tourist. They didn't turn out so well. After being seated basically at Â my time reserved, I could not wait to see what the menu had to offer. The $8-9 pints of beer/glasses of wine I was downing had me nervous about telling my significant other that we can get WHATEVER we wanted from the menu since I had been anticipating this visit foe so long. The menu items and descriptions had my mouth watering while I gave skittish glances and the tables around me to see what others had settled on eating (I say settled because there were so many great choices and I wanted to eat them all but could not).After discussing the choices in great detail (as we often do) we decided on the Goat Liver Mousseline (served in a jar with jelly preserve on top and complete with home made crumpets on which to spread), Fried Duck Tongues (delicious but very salty and somewhat spongy with some grease and probably my least favourite course), a nice little Mushroom Ragout course (which made me want to lick the bottom of the terracotta bowl) and for a starter we ordered Chicken Little consisting of a round loaf that was infused with a hint of celery. It was served with pots of chicken liver butter and a carrot & sage oil. We knew we were in for a treat this evening from the very first bite.In fact, Jo turned to me and gave me her '...oh my god...' look she does when we really hit the jackpot in our food adventures. She honestly did say this was the best meal of her life. Imagine that from a small-plates, live-up-to-its-over-hyped name restaurant hailing from the West Loop area of the windy city. Who needs a big, honking meat an potatoes meal to fill you up when you have a gem of a place like this in your neighbourhood. And almost better than the food (but not quite) ??The entire bill with one drink each cost us $58.83 USD.That's it. Unbelievable. My girlfriend turned to me and said in a hurried tone 'Pay the bill. Now. Let's get out of here.' Thinking they had made a mistake. They hadn't, of course, and neither did we by choosing to have our one big dinner night out while on a quick jaunt to the Windy City at Girl & the Goat."
"Some people who read my reviews complain that I am too picky, too critical, and don't give out enough stars. I have tried to explain that I am frugal with my ratings for a reason: when I give 5 stars, you know I really, really think a business goes above and beyond and is truly outstanding. Girl and the Goat deserves this fifth star.My friends had received a gift card and invited me here on a Sunday evening when they were lucky enough to snag a last minute reservation due to a cancellation. At first I was hesitant to accept, reluctant to spend the money and a little fearful my finicky palate would not find anything to please it. But since I hadn't seen them in quite a while, I went.So glad I did!First I enjoyed an old-fashioned (strong but good) and my friends enjoyed other cocktails. We started with a blueberry bread, served piping hot with coffee butter and a blueberry concoction (not really a jam, not sure technically what it was). We also shared a special of the whipped back fat served with bourbon onions. The name did not sound appealing to me, but this pig fat was spread on bread, basically tasted like bacon butter and was delicious. Next were chickpea fritters served with a few different types of chickpeas and tomatoes, very good. My friends had the skirt steak served with beets and a goat's milk caramel; I tasted the beets and the sauce and found it a bit salty but I think they liked the steak a lot. Â One of my favorite dishes of the evening was roasted pig's face. Â Yes, I stuffed my face with face (does that make me two-faced?) and, holy moly, Wilbur was tasty. I would have face-planted into it if I wasn't in public. Â Never in my life did I think I would do that (esp as a former vegetarian), but when faced with the opportunity again, I would face it head on (okay, I can face facts, my jokes are corny). Â My other favorite dish was the sauteed shrimp with peanut pork ragout, shitake mushrooms and spaghetti squash (I have got to figure out how to make this at home).We also tried the sauteed green beans in a fish sauce vinaigrette with cashews and they were excellent as well, nice and crisp. My friend had the fudgsicle desert with dragon's milk stout and he really liked it.Our server Marnie could not have been more friendly, even taking the time to find out for me who the vendors were when I expressed my interest in the local farm sources. It turns out they are very farm to table and Staphanie is quite discerning when it comes to her sources. This is great news to me, because it means I would be open to eating certain meats there that I don't normally eat in restaurants. I am very excited to go back and try a lot more dishes now. We also got to say hello to Stephanie, and while I felt bad as she was hard at work, she was quite nice and accomodating.Face it, this girl was very pleased with Girl and the Goat and cannot say enough good things."
Yum! Food is awesome. Great vibe all around. Awesome staff! Prices are reasonable and fair for the food and experience. Order Pig Face and save room for dessert!
"Another celebrity chef finds funding. Â But in this case, I'm glad. Â I'm a Chicago native so I love to see Chicago spaces. Â The atmosphere is still open like a restaurant should be but in no way pretentious. Â I thought the food was and beverages fit that description as well. Â I am for any place that has a solid bourbon menu but more so when they work so hard to make it work on the food menu as well. Â And premium bourbons in high-end cocktails. Â I'm sold and will continue to return every 6 months or sooner if they'll just let me get faster reservations!"
"We have been wanting to go here since it opened and since we live in the neighborhood it seems silly that it took us so long to finally try this famous place right around the corner. Â We really enjoyed our dinner there, but there was a little too much time between courses and the server told the two of us we should order four or five plates and that was just too much for two people so I did not get to have dessert :(. Â It may have been because unknowingly we ordered some of the bigger plates. Â The pretzel bread was pretty good nothing to write home about though. Â I did not care for the goat cheese tortellini it was a bit too citrusy for my taste, it just seemed like the ingredients were a bit off. Â Now, the best thing I ate there were the green beans OMG I will never eat green beans again without thinking of these green beans...Stephanie can you please tell me how to make something even half as good as them at home? Â I can't stop thinking about them although I guess I will have to wait another two and a half months to get a reservation so I can have them again. Â Do they do take out? We also ordered the chicken dish, it was excellent and the fried pickles and sauces on the side were delish, as a Florida girl I can say those are the best fried pickles I have ever had and I have had a lot of fried pickles in my day. Â We also ordered the pork shank, it was pretty salty, but it fell off of the bone and we really enjoyed it!If you go there you must order the Green Beans!!!!!!"
"Even though we had to wait 20+ minutes past our reservation time for a table (on a Monday), I still can't hate on G&TG. It was fantastic, I loved everything I had, and I thought all the dishes were really unique. My party of four got cocktails while we waited in the low couches by the bar. My favorites were the Dark & Stormy (rum with a peppery aftertaste) and the Aviation (gin but without tasting like a pine tree). The drinks came out super fast. Each was around $12-15. We got a nice ego boost when the server told us we all looked young. Even though the place was packed, it wasn't that loud. Must be those awesome high ceilings. The server at our table was great. He made sure (or tried to) that a veggie dish and a meat dish came out at the same time, since our table was 50/50 vegetarians and meatatarians. He also graciously comped us a dish per couple for our wait. I love how the menu is split into veggie dishes, fish dishes and meat dishes (although the server alerted us to the fact that some of the veggie stuff might have meaty elements so be sure to ask). It seemed the veg stuff got as much thought and care as the other categories. We tried: -Pretzel bread with mustard butter and horseradish dip. Amazing. The bread was covered in butter and salt and went perfectly with the mustard butter. I couldn't even bring myself to try the other dip, that butter was too good. -Pan fried shishito peppers. My favorite. They were coated in parmesan cheese and a miso sauce. Every fourth one is supposed to be hotter than the others. I had three hot ones and it killed my mouth but it was worth it. -Honey crisp soup. I only had a bite or two. Rich and creamy. Like a pumpkin soup but with a little bit of a tarty, apple flavor. A great winter soup. -Chickpea fritters. These were the bomb. The fritters themselves were soft but surrounded by crunchy chickpeas and feta and a really tasty sauce. The meat eaters liked these a lot, too. -Squash ravioli. This was good but didn't blow me away as much as the others. The ravioli were cooked to a good al dente texture. I liked the mushroom sauce. -Roasted cauliflower. The server picked this for us as our comped dish. I was hesitant because cauliflower and mint aren't my favorites but the flavors were great. Somehow this place makes you like things you didn't think your would. -Sweet potato gratin. I had like one bite of this since I was so full. The sweet potatoes were good and had salty straw onions mixed in. I also tried the brussel sprouts and tomatoes from the scallop dish and looooved them. The sauce is amazing, although one person's scallop wasn't as seared as the other's. The non-veggies also seemed to really like the pig's face and goat belly. I would order probably two less dishes next time, or even three less if I wanted dessert. But I'm glad we tried a lot of things, since it will be a while before we snag another reservation. Not a cheap dinner but definitely a great place to celebrate with friends."
"Definitely glad we went to Girl and the Goat, especially since I've now been justified for rooting for Chef Izard all through Top Chef. Â We were only able to get a 10:30 resi on a Sunday about 2 months in advance. Â That's how poppin this place is. Â Girl and the Goat is a small plate / Tapas style restaurant, so it's best to go with a large group of people. Â My group had 5, and we ordered about 15 plates. Â I think that was a bit much, probably could have gotten away with about 12. Â But even cutting down the menu to 15 was tough!The menu is split up into 4 different sections, specials, veg, fish, and meat. Â They will bring out the food as it is prepared, but it's not going to be veg then fish then meat, they actually put some thought process into the order of the courses, which I really liked.I love trying new foods, and I was able to try a lot of new things at G&TG. Â Favorite dishes included the Goat Carpachio, escargot ravioli, duck tongue, pig face, green beans, and the cauliflower. Â  We had no room for dessert, so can't comment on that. Â Final thought: I would come here all the time if I lived in Chicago! Â Stephanie Izard please open a restaurant in NYC!Weird side note - the next morning I went to put on the sweatshirt I was wearing the previous evening and it smelled like the wood-burning stove. I guess the smell permeates the restaurant, but not in a bad way. Â I really like the cabin / lodge vibe of the place."
"Was definitely a fun experience, but I'm not sure if i'd go back for more. First off they try to utilize all the space so we're cramped when seated. Â Not too private. Â The service was great and the food was very tasty, but also pretty heavy. Â I may go back one more time if it's a big group so we can try more stuff, but it better be for a special occasion. Â Definitely a place to try once but after that I don't have to go back."
"hmmm... i'm a fan. Â but, a reservation required a month in advance?! Â its not THAT good! Â sheesh. Â but, i'm not from chicago.. Â so, as a tourist i sucked it up and took the early res. Â spot... Â which the staff was actually really nice and told me abt when they called to reconfirm. Â great staff from the hostess to the waiters!anyway, onto the food... Â list from best to worst.1) LOVED the wood fired walter's chicken. Â chicken was delish, as was the naan it came with... &&& to top it all off... the most delicious fried pickles!!! Â 2) wood oven roasted pig face. Â inventive and delicious! Â fried eggs always make everything a lil better in my book! Â 3) grilled baby octopus. Â loooooooove. Â perfectly cooked and loved all the veggies and spices mixed in. Â yum yum yum4) sauteed green beans. Â delicious! Â a lil heavier than i would have liked... prob coulda nixed the fish sauce vinaigrette on top and it woulda been perfection.5) duck fat bread. Â had a lovely tang to it... Â a sourdoughish kinda bread? Â dunno but it was good as was the spread.6) my least favorite was the goat liver mousse. Â bread was good.. but, i was just not a fan of the mousse. Â mleh.two ppl = probably 2 plates, max 3 will be enough."
"Amazing. Simply AMAZING! This ""Top Chef Master"" knocks it out of the ballpark this time around. CULINARY GENIUS is what you will find here. Inventive is an understatement.Trumps Avec (Sorry Ed!) and Blackbird (it paled in comparison) down the road - neither of which I care to revisit. It's a ""been there done that"" kinda thing. But this place, however... takes permanence on my ""go to"" list next time I'm in Chicago. Once just isn't enough.It's hard to get into this place so book WAY IN ADVANCE. Try like a month in advance at the very least. I was searching for a table for 4-6 people and could only get a table for 2 at 9 pm! So take whatever you can get, it's worth it in the end."
"I was extremely excited to try this restaurant and boy was it worth my 3 month wait! There was 6 of us so we each picked about 2 things since they are small plates. By far my favorite thing was the Scallops! DELICIOUS! Scallops; must get! Absolutely delicious!Pigs face; also very good and interesting (however they pair it with an egg over easy so it tastes a lot like something you would have for breakfast)Beef tongue; good, similar to a beef jerky textureHad both breads; they were good but nothing to die forThe wait staff was also very nice and helpful explaining everything. Even the busboys were very knowledgeable on what everything is. Everything we tried was great but the mentions above really stood out. Definitely make a reservation, like I said ours was made three months in advance and the only time we could get was ten at night (however it was on a Saturday). People were still being seated when we we leaving at 11:45!"
"Great Food, Atmosphere, and Service!!!! Â Just be willing to pay for it. Â The Pork Shank was out of this world, better than the Pig Face, which was deliscious on its own. Â Duck tongues were ok, Goat empanadas very tasty."
"This place is fantastic! My husband and I went here last night for dinner. Despite making a reservation, we still had to wait for some time before we got our table. We read Yelp reviews and ordered the more popular dishes - the ham frittes (came with smoked tomato aioli and cheddar beer sauce), sauteed green beans (with fish sauce vinaigrette) and the pork, veal and goat sugo. Note that we aren't fans of green beans. When my husband wanted to order the sauteed green beans based on yelp reviews, my eyes bulged and my jaws dropped. WHAT?! But oh my, the green beans were amazing! It was big crunchy green beans with cashew nuts. Towards the bottom of the dish, it got a little too salty - I'll love to have it served with white rice! Too salty to eat it on its own...The ham frittes were skinny and yet crispy. Probably the best fries I've ever had. And there was the taste of ham when you start chewing. Again, towards the middle/end, it got wayyyyyy too salty. Last came the pork, veal and goat sugo. Even before this came, we were pretty stuffed (we had the starter bread which you have to pay for) and have yet to finish our previous 2 dishes - the beans and the fries! But we HAD to eat that sugo. We didn't regret over-stuffing our stomachs with it. It was simply heavenly. I loved the pasta that came with it. The meat were very tasty, but not too salty. The pasta blended in well with the mashed meat.Our server wasn't the best - he was usually no where to be found when we needed him and somehow, he apportioned more time to the other tables than us. We had to eventually be served by this mexican guy who cleared our table. That guy was funny and helpful. Must-go guys!"
"My experience with Girl and Goat is two fold. On one hand my introduction to this establishment tainted it for me- thus it did not earn 5 stars. There were 4 of us heading out for dinner that night. My friends called ahead for a reservation and were told reservations were booked solid through the month, however they always welcome walk-ins (even their web site has a section addressing welcoming walk-ins wholeheartedly) and our wait time on a Saturday night should be between 1 and 2 hours. We decided we'd head over, put our names in and grab drinks for 2 hours till our table was ready.Sadly, the hostess is a total moron. It's disapointing for a young restaurant with such potential to have totally incompetent people running the show and being the face of the place. We got there around 6:30pm and put our names in and were quoted 1.5 to 2 hours wait time. Long story short... over 3.5 hours later and about a million trips up to the hostess stand to inquire about the progress of our table (""you are the NEXT table to be seated"" became the joke of the night) we walked out over $100 poorer due to all the drinks we had consumed to kill time. And we were starving! If you are keeping track it was now after 10pm. The issue, we finally found out, is that they have two seating lists. One is for reservations and one is for walk-ins. We were the next ""walk-in"" table to be seated, however we wouldn't be seated till every last reservation had been seated first. Really lousy way to run a business. Had the hostess been honest when we got there and advised us we wouldn't be seated till after 10pm we'd have happily made a reservation for another night and left without issue. However, we were consistently lied to for over 3.5 hours and made to feel like fools. And not to be mean, but come on. A hostess at Girl and Goat isn't gonna talk down to me. She can't get away with validating her pathetic little existance by making me feel like I'm the loser. Take a look at your life sweetheart. God was she pretentious. My first experience earned them 0 stars. And remember- you only get 1 chance to make a first impression. Anyway- I was SO on fire the next morning that rather than going right to Yelp as I typically would, I wrote a 2 page letter directly to the manager/owners of Girl and Goat. I was just outraged! Â I was surprised when 48 hours later the general manager Chris e-mailed me back apologizing profusely and offered a complimentary dinner on the house for the 4 of us- he really wanted the chance to show us what they are made of. I asked my friends what they thought and everyone felt at the very least, after over 3.5 hours waiting for a table, we had earned a free dinner. So we accepted his invitation. Now with Chris in charge it was a 5 star night- but due to our intorduction to the restaurant I could only give 4 stars. I can forgive, but I can't forget.Chris made the night wonderful. Chris deserves a raise. I have no idea what he makes- but they need to double it! As soon as our entire party had arrived we were seated quickly. Chris introduced himself to us and made us feel welcome and comfortable. Our waiter was hilarious! I wish I remembered his name- he was great. And he really knew the menu and was able to guide us through it. He too deserves a raise- whatever he makes- they need to double THAT!!What we ordered:-Cranberry bread with goat cheese butter Â (very good)-Sweet potato gratin, Â  Â (very good)-Lamb sausage stuffed calamari, Â (EXCELLENT! The calamari was huge and the lamb sausage heart stoppingly good)-Frog legs, Â  (EXCELLENT- I personally had some trouble forgetting what I was actually eating, but they really were fantastic!)-Pig face, Â  Â (very good but a little too crispy for my taste)-Goat masala pizza, (EXCELLENT! One of the stars of the night for sure and a large portion, perfect for sharing!)-Goat pork and veal sugo, Â (EXCELLENT- My FAVORITE of the night!!! I ate most of it myself- I devoured this dish!)-Grilled skirt steak, Â  (very good)-Walter's chicken Â  Â (EXCELLENT! I'm not a huge fan of restaurant chicken cause it's usually dry or boring but this was anything but. It was just melt in your mouth good. It's a must order).I feel like I'm forgetting something else we ordered... hmmm...For dessert we got all 4 desserts on the menu as they are small and perfect to share- everyone got a sample. Bourbon apples (EXCELLENT!), blood orange sorbet (EXCELLENT!), and I can't recall the other 2 desserts. But the stars of the show in the dessert category were the bourbon apples and blood orange sorbet.All in all Chris at Girl and the Goat saved the day. He is fantastic at his role in this establishment. Our waiter was wonderful and made the experience really special. The food was delicious and unique and great to share. I would absolutely recommend Girl and the Goat- but get a reservation!"
"I made a quick trip to Chicago in late February and heard all the buzz surrounding this restaruant, including the difficulty getting a reservation. Â As it turned out, a reservation was unnecessary for a party of two on a Sunday night -- we waited no more than a half-hour in the lounge area, where we had a pre-dinner (expensive! yikes) cocktail. But I went for the food, so that is the focus of all five stars of my review.1. Â Wood-fired oysters. Â Living in New Orleans, I tend to be partial to our fat gulf oysters, but I'll eat just about anything in a shell and enjoy it. Â There was nothing to dislike about this dish, the sauce of which reminded me of a coriander chutney, but I wasn't enthralled either. Â Given the description, I imagined there would be a smokey/briney flavor, but the sauce masked those elements if they were there. Â I encourage you, however, to discount the opinion of this oyster snob when considering this dish. Â 2. Chickpea fritters. Â Henry Rollins once wrote in a poem I quote all too often, ""Madonna/ She makes me want to shop at Sears/ She makes me want to beat up vegetarians."" Â A dish like this would make even Mr. Black Flag go veggie.3. Â Seared scallop with goat sausage and shrimp. Â This was the best dish we ordered. Â I say that without any hesitation. Â I said that to the waitress before we left. Â And I'll say it again now. Â 4. Â Skate with goat belly and egg. Â Egg added a nice fatty element to the surprisingly lean belly cut. Â 5. Â Goat loin. Â Though this was my least favorite among the dishes we ordered, it would be a stand-out dish at any number of restaurants -- nice depth of smokey, sweet and savory. Â Great flavor development in the sauce.6. Sesame semifreddo, porkfat donuts with sambal pineapple. I usually don't dig on desert. Â I'm easily bored with sweets. Â This was not boring. Â Don't shy away from this dish because you're expecting an Indonesian mega-hot sambal -- the heat was subtle and elevated the other components. The flavor of the spiced fruit reminded me of the chili-pepper-rubbed pineapple you can buy in the park in Mexico City. Â Forgive my philistinism, but I cannot tell the difference between ice cream/gellato/semifreddo/etc. Â Does that lessen my value as a human being and desert-eater? Probably. Do I care? Not when I have a desert like this one in front of me."
"SAUTEED GREEN BEANS IN FISH SAUCE VINAIGRETTE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Â­!!!!!!!!!!!! Green Beans have become my favorite green veggie and the green beans at Girl in the Goat are the best! the best I have ever had. Shallots, green beans, fish sauce blend together perfectly.The Girl and the Goat is a great modern restaurant. Well stocked bar and a fun night crowd. Foodie heaven. The lamb shanks and goat, pork and veal sugo were some other favorites.Portions were larger than expected. Our meal was slightly over salted."
"4.5 for food but service pushes it over to a 5. Came for a solo dinner and got a seat right away at the bar, the server was so nice and helpful too. Got their strawberry bread which was so hot it nearly burned my fingers, but oh yes I like that pain. It means there is crispy crusted bread with a warm soft and moist center. Accompanying the bread was this wonderful strawberry butter (surprisingly not sweet, but creamy, buttery with a nice aroma of strawberries) and a strawberry rhubarb rosemary jam thing (this was sweet with great rosemary flavors shining through). I also got the tuna with lamb sausage. It came with blueberries, pepitas which are light crispy little nuts. The lamb sausage and the blueberry had flavors that really popped, unfortunately so strong that it covered the tuna flavors.My last dish was the goat empanadas. Can't go to girl and the goat without trying a goat dish. OMG light crispy skin which was super thin, stuffed with a spicy meaty filling that did not have the usual gaminess expected of goat. The sauces which went with the empanadas was also perfect a blend of tomato based sauce mixed with yogurt was perfect!"
Food was alright... Great concept but the food was short of impressive...
"I've been here four times now...and it just gets better. Â (and I happily get fatter.) Â The food is always described as ""the best ___ I've ever had"" and the servers/chefs are a rare breed of hilarious/knowledgable/friendly. Â (Like, I want to hang out with them in real life and give them nicknames and hug and stuff.)The menu can be a bit daunting, but the servers are extremely helpful and always seem to be right when making recommendations -- especially Gary, he's our fave. Â Just be sure to get the cauliflower (yes, I said cauliflower), you won't be sorry. Â  Warning: you will leave in a food coma. Â If you don't, you're no friend of mine."
"This is a great restaurant. I have been here three times and have not been disappointed. There are lots of gluten free options and they even have gluten free bread! I have yet to have a dish that wasn't great. One of the visits I was even sat by the kitchen, it was pretty cool watching them cook since the kitchen is open. I highly recommend eating here if you get the chance!"
"My in-laws were in town and I couldn't miss a chance to take them to the best restaurant. So we had no plans no strategy. We ran to Avec on Randolph and were disappointed with long wait time. Guess what, that's the best thing happened to us in a long time.. .lolllzz.. We did a felony (almost) which was entering the Girl without reservations. The restaurant was full on a Saturday night. But the staff was very warm and accommodating. They offered us a full menu service at the lounge and we couldn't be happier. Was I lucky or what?? The best thing ever happened to me. Words can't describe how good their food is.. phenomenal. The combination of the textures are amazing. The food that you have never heard of.. duck tongue, wood fired escargot, pan roasted chicken, bread with chutneys, roasted cauliflower, dessert..yumm!! We had about 8 different items on the menu. Each one of them were very unique and flavorful and a 5 star on their own. I almost got an orgasm in my mouth. Their menu includes local, fresh, seasonal items.I would go again with reservations to experience the site down dinner at the dinner table .. :)"
"Decor: 4. I didn't like the painting on the wall. Everything else was perfect. Presentation of the food: 5Service: 5Food: 1- cauliflower: interesting smell. surprisingly bland. - green beans: too salty. it tastes like an ordinary chinese green bean dish- scallops: perfect tenderness. nice flavor. the scallops themselves were too salty.- pig face: the meat felt too meaty. it was too heavy. - goat loin: the meat was too rare and tough. other than that, flavor was perfect. - shrimp: mediocre. nothing special.conclusion: overhyped."
"""Universally disappointing"" is what my dining companions called this new, over-hyped dining establishment and I have to agree. Â Not just because the dining room din is comically deafening and you'll need to air out your jacket before you wear it again or you'll have all the neighborhood dogs tracking you. Â My biggest surprise was experiencing how heavy and salty everything was on the menu. Â Even the vegetable dishes. Â Any restaurant that cares about providing a decent culinary experience will craft a menu with a balance of heavy and light offerings, palate cleansers, etc. to keep from overwhelming the digestive system. Â Not so at G&G - this is not even terribly creative gluttony, frankly. Â Everything gets an in-your-face dose of rich, smokey meat essence- especially the seafood dishes...even the desserts. Â I remember Scylla's high quality, delicate and thoughtful menu, G&G is a noisy, smoked, porky smack in the head. Â The positive bits: Â good artwork, decent cocktails, great bathrooms and multiple bread choices. Â Maybe you have to be a Top Chef near-winner to put a balanced/refined menu on the map in Chicago. Â Cheers to Dale."
"I think the cab ride home after this meal says it all:*silence*Seriously, crickets could have been heard if the cab driver rolled down the windows. Â This meal was perfection. Â We were full. Â We were stunned. Â And wow, were we happy. Â I was thinking ahead in making our reservation a month ahead of time and made it for 4 - more mouths to try food! Â We grabbed our best men and took off finally for Randolph! Â Ms Izard's mix-ologist is a master! Â We had something with the word ""three"" in it that tasted like pink lemonade. Â And then something with absinthe in it - which tasted tasty but dangerous! Â Love it! Â Among the dishes we tried (it changes almost weekly which I LOVE!):-whole wheat bread with a honey butter (honeycomb purchased that very morning at Green City Market)-warm marinated olives (mmmm....)-chickpeas Three Ways Â (the fritters melted in your mouth)-green beans with fish sauce and cashews (these fish NOT-luvin' girls loved this dish!)-chicken with watermelon and grilled avocado (why have I never thought to grill avocado!?)-goat pizza (larger than I expected and YUM)-lamb ribs (although good, not a favorite)-the coveted pigs face with a sunny-side egg on top (the texture was odd, and the taste was fine - glad I tried it but wouldn't have eaten the whole thing!)-corn nouget Â with bacon for dessert (meh)The service was SPOT ON. Â The best of them? Â The bus boys. Â My water glass (that I used a LOT to cleanse my palette) was never empty. Â Our plates disappeared so quickly. Â Everything was amazing! Â I love how they didn't bring out everything all at once, and reminded you in detail of what you ordered. Â Stephanie Izard worked diligently on the line. Â Awesome to see her right there. Â I want to know how to get one of those 2 seats right there on the cook line though....didn't notice that until we left. Â I already have a second rezzie made....cannot wait to get back and see some more girl and try some more goat!"
Love this place!!! Always busy so be prepared to make a reservation. Â Food is delicious and each bite is full of flavor.
"I recently took my buddy here for a birthday dinner. Â The food is excellent with the exception of the ""duck bread"" which was just ok. Â Faves were the goat empanadas, the bone-in pork shank (massive!) and the soft shell crab. The prices were reasonable given the quality. Â we split four appetizers and four entrees, had two drinks each and the bill was around $160 before tip. Â There's a lot of variety on the menu and Â I'll definitely return to sample some more of the girl and the goat's goodness."
"Spontaneously got invited last night after my friend informed me he had a reservation for 4 that he'd made 3 months ago that he needed to fill.The main things worth noting:-Best dishes on the menu include: Lamb ragu (to die for good!), lamb shank, cauliflower dish (trust me on this, even if you're not a huge veggie lover), chickpea fritters-Not worth ordering: any of the breads as an appetizer, goat flatbread, scallops (were good but just like scallops anywhere and you only get two scallops--so it's one of the smaller portion sizes in comparison to the other dishes for the same price)Lastly, it may be because the four of us were smaller eaters, but the server's recommendation to get 8-10 dishes for 4 people was WAY too much food. We couldn't even eat the chicken dish we'd ordered and left half of the lamb shank to be thrown out in the trash--tragedy. Thus, be careful/keep in mind that these dishes are a bit larger than your usual tapas small plates. We would have been much better of with about 6 dishes in total.Will definitely go back!"
Amazing. The food was top notch and sophisticated without being pretentious. Get the goat leg.
"Was in Chicago on business for a night and when in search of something near the Loop pooped up this place - 2000+ reviews and still a 4.5 star rating - I had to try! Obviously there were no reservations for the same evening, honestly I don't think there were any for the next 3 months worth of evenings, but luckily it was just me and they serve their full menu at the bar. I came in at 6:45 and was promptly seated, even having a few chair options. I chose right, because over the course of the evening all the other patrons by me were also solo diners and we just became the best of friends ordering different dishes and forking at each other's plates. Some of the things on the menu were so so in my book: fried pickles and the goat cheese dessert. Some of the things more then made up for it: green beans (yum), wood smoked broccoli & blue cheese (OMG AMAZEBALLS!), the crudo with pork belly (WOW), and what everyone says about the pork face is true it was definitely one of the best pork dishes I've ever had. But the STAR of the meal was the miso-butterscotch budino for dessert. It's a budino, it's an upside down pineapple cake, it's deliciousness on a plate! The best thing is that they serve a lot of their dishes as halves so you can try that many more dishes during your visit. And DO NOT forget to try their cocktails!"
I ate here last year sometime and 24 hours later I became severely ill. I ended up in bed for 3 days and lost 10 lbs. I would never return even if they offered a free overrated meal.
"When your significant other declares ""I want to go to Girl & the Goat for my birthday dinner,"" but neglects to give you three months' notice, you end up on an OpenTable vigil hoping someone makes a last minute cancellation. And it works because everyone else makes their reservations three months ahead of time, and inveritably one of those people will have a change of plans.Which is good, because this is a dinner everyone should have at least once, and it's unique enough to qualify as a birthday present. Yes it's noisy and yes the food is salty, and yes your clothes will smell like you went to a Korean BBQ place instead of a Top Chef restaurant, but it's worth it because you're not going to get food like this at any other restaurant (to my knowledge).Dinner for 2 = kohlrabi salad + squash blossom rangoon + goat empanadas + goat flatbread + skate wing + bread course + 3 beers + 2 desserts + excellent service + tip = $150. Everything was delicious but I'm still trying to wrap my head around the smoked peaches with blue cheese gelato I had for dessert. It's not for everyone, but I'm glad I ordered it."
"With well nigh 800 reviews already, it barely feels necessary to add my voice to the chorus. Â Go. Â Just go. Â We went at about 6 on a Sunday, put our names on the wait list, and walked across the street to the local brew pub to have a beer while we waited. Â About an hour later we went back and were seated shortly after. Â We were a group of four, which I think was about the right size to go with -- we were able to order plenty of different things so we could sample a large portion of the menu. Â Had it just been two of us, we would have gotten to eat more of each thing we ordered, but probably would have ordered fewer selections overall. Â  Â I won't bother to list every thing we ordered because they were all outstanding. Â (But yes, get the pig face. Â And the asparagus. Â And the scallops. Â And the goat belly. Â And the tuna.)Shout-out to our waiter Brendan (Brandon? Â Brennan?), who was outstanding, and dealt very kindly with the somewhat inebriated member of our group."
"I had heard so much about Girl & the Goat that we had to try it. Was I absolutely blown away? Not really. Was it good food and amazing service/atmosphere? Yes. They have a menu that is perfect for the adventurous eater (you love stomach, liver, necks, and pigs face). It has simplistic yet delicious small plates that are meant to be shared. However, for all the hype, I can't say it was the best food I've ever had. It also seems a bit overpriced. I think we would keep going back to try new things since they change the menu up a lot, but there are some things I wouldn't order again. I would say the Kalbi style ribs are a must. The servers are very helpful and attentive - they even brought us hot towels to wipe off our hands after eating the ribs. The atmosphere is casual yet romantic. It's great for a crowd or a date. It's a restaurant that I would definitely say you should try, but I wouldn't say it's the best food of all time."
"I'm sorry, Stephanie Izard, I was a fan of you on the show, but I'm going to go against the grain here and share my opinion that I just didn't enjoy my experience. I met some girlfriends here for dinner and we were super excited to try it. I hadn't eaten since noon, and was very ready to chow down.Unfortunately, ""chowing down"" at Girl and the Goat is impossible because the small plates are even smaller than any tapas I've ever had. There is no option just to get an entree, so I was surprised when each tiny plate of food costs $15-20 each! I understood going in that this would not be cheap, but I mean, come on! We're not in New York. The food was good, wine list good, drinks good - but it was all pretty mediocre. I've gotten better creative dishes at HB in Lakeview and you get way more bang for your buck there. I ended up leaving there in kind of a state of shock (and not just because we were basically hounded by the bus boys until we left our table) because I didn't know what to think. It all went by so fast and so underwhelmingly - and left me hungry.On a positive note: the green beans *almost* saved the entire night. But when I realized that the only thing I loved there was the side of green beans... 2 stars it is."
"No lie. This is the best restaurant I have been to in a long time. Girl and the Goat took me (and the rest of my table) on a fantastic flavor journey and I could not have been more impressed. After two months waiting for my reservation to roll around, we could not contain our excitement. Word of caution: this is a major new restaurant in Chicago, so do not be disappointed if you wait 45 minutes for your table even if you have a reservation (we did). Our server Jodi was tops. When we ordered our food, she took a moment to analyze everything on the ticket and then suggested two additional items that she thought would compliment our order. She was spot on.The first dish that came to the table was the roasted beets with white anchovy. This was a good dish, but was a little strong on the anchovy flavor. This is in no way a knock on the overall dish, which was quite good, it is merely my way of warning future patrons what to expect when they are thinking of ordering this dish.Next came the hiramasa with pork bellies and caper berries. Holy crap! The flavor profile on this dish was phenomenal. The fish was fresh and the pork and caper berries contributed salt and tartness that took the dish to a whole new level.Scallops with brussel sprouts hit the table and again, holy crap! Two very large scallops were cooked perfectly and the brussel sprouts were in a sauce that had the perfect amount of creaminess. The bowl was just about licked clean. The ham frites came next. As I said earlier, our server Jodi recommended a couple of other dishes that we were happy to order. For this one, she suggested that we also order the mussels to pair with the frites. Man, she was right. The mussels were huge and cooked to perfection. The wine sauce with the mussels had pieces of minced sausage that gave the flavor an entirely new dimension. Once we finished with the mussels, the frites were then dumped in the wine sauce and it blew our minds how good the two went together. Nice work, Jodi!The green beans came at us next. I think someone in the kitchen may have hit them with too much salt. While still very good with its fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews, the salt level was a bit too high for us.The second to last dish was the lamb-stuffed calamari. As a Greek guy, I love nothing more that lamb and calamari. Girl and the Goat found a way to combine the two in way that made me dreaming of my childhood in Greece. Opa!We ended the meal with the lamb shank. This was a grand slam if I had ever experienced one. The shank had obviously been roasting all day long because it fell off the bone and was juicy, flavorful, and it made us all want to howl at the moon. Yeah, it was really, really good. The dish came with flatbread and accompaniments like tzatziki sauce, fried onions, and giardiniera. After this dish, we were in perhaps the most delicious food coma ever!To wrap this review up, Girl and the Goat must be the best addition to the Chicago restaurant scene in years. The food, wine, cocktails, and service are all worth the wait for reservation and I cannot speak more highly of the place. Excellent job, Stephanie Izard!"
"So much hype....so hard to get a reservation...but this place is for real.Some great, interesting dishes here, and for very reasonable prices. Â LOVED the chickpea fritter. Â The apple soup, octopus, and redfish were also most excellent. Â Pig face was a little too rich for me, but ultimately very tasty. Â  Â The only dish we didn't like were the roasted peppers. Â Just a big crock of bland, unpeeled, unseeded peppers. Â We only ate a few, then left the crock untouched. Â Our waiter saw we weren't eating it, then took it away. Â We didn't say anything, except that we didn't really like it. Â At the end of the night it was comped from our bill. Â If a bad dish is comped without even asking, did it ever even exist? Â For the purposes of this review, guess not."
"Absolutely lived up to all the hype! Â We went with a group of 12 and with such a big party it took us two months to get in.....but that wasn't a bummer at all. Â It was sooo worth the wait and gave us all something to look forward to.We were able to sit right by the open kitchen and got to experience Chef Izard in action. Â She is such a wonderful chef and was completely graceful when we met her during our group photo with her. Â The great thing about going with such a large group is that we tried nearly everything the menu had to offer. Â The pig face was so tender and simply brilliant!The atmosphere was amazing. Â Clean and modern with an elegant taste. Â After admiring the shirts the wait staff wear, I simply had to bring a little Goat home so I bought a t-shirt at the end of dinner....it was such a fun touch to an awesome evening!"
"Is there anything I can say about this restaurant that 700+ reviews haven't said? Â Probably not. Â That don't mean I ain't writing a review.Four of us ordered chickpea fritters, ham frites, goat belly with crab and lobster, a squash bread with pecan butter, those damn amazing green beans, pig face, escargot ravioli and scallops with xo sauce (plus a bottle of wine).Everything. Was. Amazing. Â The green beans especially. Â I don't know what kind of crack sauce Stephanie Izard has come up with, but I want to bathe in it. Â Our server was amazing and just as attentive as necessary. Â It's also a good thing they constantly refill water because as other people have said, the food IS salty. Â Stephanie came over (upon our request) and took a picture with us. Â She was friendly and fantastic. Â Would I come back? Â DUH."
"We just moved to Chicago and were super excited about trying Girl & the Goat. Â Overall, the food definitely had a ""wow"" factor - the duck tongues were by far our favorite, crunchy & melt-in-your-mouth, and the poke that accompanied them was fresh and spicy. Â The fried oysters were also delicious, and the shiitake gelato was surreal. Â But we're only giving it 3 stars because the service was EXTREMELY rushed. Â Even early on a Monday night, the atmosphere was as chaotic as most restaurants on the weekend. Â Our server was very friendly and helpful, but the next dish arrived before we'd even taken a bite of the previous one, with no pauses in between. Â The check also arrived at the same time as dessert. Â  We felt like we were part of a factory assembly line and their purpose was to stuff delicious food down our throats and then boot us out of there. Â With a restaurant of such renown and quality, we expected to have time to savor our food, but no such luck."
"Four stars, entirely for the food. Â Chef Stephanie, Top Chef winner, James Beard nominee, and Best New Restaurant by Food and Wine, is running the hell out of Girl and the Goat. Â She is catering to exactly what Chicago is loving right now: creativity and innovation. Â Girl and the Goat is another one of those restaurants that allow you to drop little cash or loads of cash, but come on. you gotta go big, It's Girl and the Goat! And if you go you probably waited a month or so for the table--- so being pragmatic is against the rules. And a suggestion: because ordering can be difficult, let one person do the ordering, getting one or two of each staple - Vegetable/Fish/Meat. Â Another small/shared plates restaurant, Chef is dishing out miniature culinary bombshells. Â Each and every oyster dish (presented on the daily oyster/bread menu) we had was fantastic. Â From raw and simple to Fried with eggplant, they are a wonderful way to start the meal. Â The Kohlrabi salad with fennel is really really good. Perhaps the best-- the Hiramasa Crudo with pork belly is phenomenal!! The only drawback preventing G&G from 5 stars is the service. Â I am probably expecting too much, but the service leaves one wanting more. Â The servers all seem to have good personality, and are knowledgable. Â But they appear rushed, too rushed to provide personable service. Â That being said, turning tables is probably of utmost importance, for their benefit and ours. Â Less a turn or two we might have to wait 3-4 months for a reservation! Girl and the Goat is not really a good place for a date, its loud and busy. Â So don't bother making a reservation for a special event. Â But do make a reservation because your reservation at Girl and the Goat will be a special event. Â From the salad to the dessert and the french drip coffee, you're in for a culinary treat from one of the most talented chef's not only in Chicago but in the whole friggin country. Â And like I said: go big, or go home. Â Life is too short for practical. Oh! And if you want to try to get a table like day of- don't bother calling. Â But show up early, seats at the bar and lounge are first come first serve."
"I ate at G&TG on a recent business trip, eager to try this much lauded spot from one of the winners of Top Chef. Apparently reservations are quite coveted, but I was told over the phone that if you simply walk in after dinner rush, you will likely be seated. Â My friend and I did just that and were seated within 15 minutes, which is hardly a wait in my book. Â The space itself is large and on the rustic side, with an open kitchen that you can look into. Â The service was friendly and attentive, and after divulging that I needed to order gluten-free, they promptly provided me with a gluten-free menu, something that is not touted on the site or anywhere that I've seen, which surprised me (in a good way). We shared the yellowtail sashimi, which I found to be disappointing and lacking in flavor. The fish itself was fresh, but the overall composition of the dish did not work for me. Â I found myself wanting citrus, or something to brighten everything. My next dish was the grilled steak, which was fine, but again nothing special. Â We ordered the ham frites, thinking they would be something along the lines of croquettes, but instead, they were the greasiest, skinniest fries topped with ham crumbles. Â It sounds good, but was actually kind of flavorless and just way too greasy. The highlight of the entire meal for me were the warm olives, sad but true. I can't say I'd give G&TG another go if I was ever in Chicago again, there seem to be far too many other places to choose from that seem far better."
"Honestly, I tend to ignore negative reviews when I want to love a new restaurant. But regardless of the overrated nature of this restaurant, the food was not only less than spectacular but really not even palatable! The only thing that was like decent were the scallops. The butternut ravioli had so much vinegar and acidity I didn't even want to eat more. The pig face was greasy and felt like eating a gross cafeteria fat patty. The skate was okay, but the pork that came with it tasted absolutely nauseating. Maybe I need to come back and order something else, Â but I pretty much ordered the most popular dishes and really didn't even want to finish any of it! Just because you put a fried egg on it doesn't hide the fact that it doesn't taste good!!!"
"The food is amazing. The ambiance was so laid back and relaxed. Only downside is that getting in is as bad as being put on hold for customer service rep to answer your call, but the wait makes it taste that much better"
"Surprising customer service encounter. Â Made reservations for my wife's birthday 4 mos ago (we had had a great experience there last year). Â Restaurant Â called with a confirmation the day before but they had both the wrong day and wrong number of guests (mistakes happen). Â Was told that the general manager said we could not be accommodated. Spoke with him directly, going back and forth (not believing I was having to argue my case). Only after I said ""never mind, I'll just Yelp you"" Â and hung up, did I get a return call from him, now magically with a table available. Really? It took a Yelp threat? Good for Yelp. Not so good for professionalism and effective problem solving. Saddens me."
"Overall: Â Excellent small plate, unpretentious gastropub, but not the best in Chicago. Â $6-$16 per plate, expect 2-3 plates per person for a full meal. Â Top Chef Stephanie Izard's new pride-and-joy after closing Scylla.1) Decor and ambiance are a definite plus. Â The restaurant was created out of an abandoned warehouse, so there are high ceilings, lots of dark wood furniture, and a very spacious bar. Â The kitchen is purposefully not hidden away, and you're so close you can interact with the cooks as they prepare your food. Â As others have mentioned, the waitstaff are unpretentious, friendly, and very passionate about the dishes. Â The minute you walk in, you feel comfortable and at ease, with the noise level just enough for activity but quiet enough to have a personal conversation.2) Price is reasonable. Â Bread portions are $4, vegetable small plates run from $6 to $10, fish/meat small plates run from $12 to $16, desserts are $8, and beers run $6 to $8 each. Â Wines are $8 to $12 per glass, correspondingly more for the bottle. Â 3) No parking. Â But what else is new? Â Located two blocks west of Avec/Blackbird on Randolph and Halsted.Now for food.4) Drinks: Â We ordered drought beers, one lighter ale and one stronger IPA. Â Both were very good, and went well with the meal as a whole. Â They do have a fair list of about 30 wines, two specific house wines, but we didn't try this, as Chef specifically seems to emphasize beers on her menu. Â It fits the unpretentious nature of the restaurant.5) Bread: Â We ordered the wheat loaf with honeycomb and ""Hunk-o-Burning-Love"" sides, purely based on the suggestion of the waiter. Â As the name suggests, the ""Hunk-o-Burning-Love"" is a mix of butter, peanut butter, banana, and bacon, and had a creative blend of savory and salty. Â The banana flavor was slightly too strong, and while it was interesting at first, I did start to miss just plain butter about halfway through. Honeycomb was pure sweetness, without anything added. Â The bread was excellent, and definite props to the baker for a loaf with some thick substance and a thin, firm-but-not-crunchy crust. Â Bread rating: Â 4/5. Great! Â Very creative butter.6) Vegetable course: Â We ordered shaved kohlrabi, made with fennel and blueberries. Â I loved this dish, as the sweet berries complemented the very slight bitterness of the vegetables exceedingly well. Â It was pulled together with a savory dressing and studded with bacon? or something similar. Â Vegetable rating: Â 5/5. Â Amazing! Â Despite all the tasty sounding meat dishes, don't pass up vegetables here.7) Fish course: Â We ordered steamed clams, cooked with pork sausage and diced fennel, as well as some pan-seared fish made with toasted black beans, squash, and mushrooms.The steamed clams were overall good. Â The sauce was a great way to use up all the bread after I was tired of eating banana/bacon butter. Â I can't exactly fault them for using Manila clams, and since I guess I'm used to Seattle, I expect larger-sized clams. Â Pork sausage was a mild choice for this dish, and I think they would have a spectacular dish had they gone with larger clams and a spicier sausage, with the fennel used to offset the spice rather than to augment the mild taste. Â The fish dish was good but not great. Â The fish itself was perfectly cooked, with a wonderful pan-seared crispy skin and tender throughout. Â The mix of black beans and squash was too much starch for a fish dish, and would have been much more appropriate with a meat dish. Â Not that I didn't eat it all, since it was good, but by the end of the course, I was focusing on eating all the mushrooms with the fish.Fish course: Â 3/5. Â Perhaps should have ordered something different.8) Meat course: Â We were full, and didn't get meat. Â The waiter raved about the short ribs though.9) Dessert course: Â We had four options available and chose to get the Fudgsicle with olive oil gelato, doused with Dragon's Milk beer. Â A very creative dessert, with a great balance between sweet and hops, but I think it would have been better with an actual chocolate ganache or even a brownie. Â The Fudgiscle seemed a little gimmicky.Dessert: Â 4/5. Â Creative.Final thoughts: Â I definitely give the Chef points for her creative blends of textures, spices, and ingredients but I feel that she sometimes tries too hard to be creative. Â While I was eating there, I felt like she was trying to impress me by purposefully avoiding the easy routes with familiar taste combinations. Â It's clear that she's still experimenting with her menu, trying to find the dishes that wow her diners. Â However, for the adventurous taster, I definitely recommend giving Girl and the Goat a try. Â Make reservations, bring lots of friends, and share as many dishes as possible."
"Can GEICO really save you 15% on your auto insurance? Does Girl and the Goat deliver the goods?Don 'the goods' Ready would say so. Randolph Street's newest addition seems to be a culinary zeitgeist. It embodies the same appeal found in many of Chicago's fave eateries: kitschy decor, tapas-style dining, and a hipster vibe. G&TG (Yes i just officially anointed Girl and The Goat with its own acronym) is classified as a gastro-pub, but it feels much more slick and metropolitan. This is the ""it"" place to grab dinner in the city. Expect to wait two weeks to get an 8pm reservation. So what does this reservation finally get you?How about the feeling that you're in the real life version of Sex and the City? There is eye candy for everyone. The bar is hoppin. The dining room feels like you're lounging in one big downtown loft. There is a wood burning pizza oven which perfumes the restaurant and Â teases your appetite. Everyone feels and looks comfortable. It is very hard for a restaurant to create the level of energy that G&TG generates. It's why we enjoy eating out. It's why we love living in the city.So what does Ole Don Ready think about the food? They've got the goods.Often times, tapas-style restaurants offer a large selection of dishes that mostly underwhelm. You end up ordering 6-10 dishes at $8-$10 a plate. You usually decide that you only enjoyed half the plates. After beverages, you're staring at a $70 a person tab. G&TG offers a modest selection of plates. There were some hits and some misses, but mostly there were hits.Braised Chicken Wings with Veal - this was a special. The wings were enjoyable with good flavor, but nothing Yelpalicious.Marinated Beef Tongue - this was a truly sophisticated preparation and interpretation packed with bright unexpected flavors. Wished the portion were bigger.Seared Scallops with braised veal - The unanimous favorite at the table. I felt like I was tasting the same talent on the plate the Top Chef Judges experienced; the same brilliance that ultimately won her the title of Top Chef.Ham Frites - probably the weakest dish, but the dish still tasted good. It just wasn't what I expected. No ham flavor. Small portion of fries too.Skate Wing with Calamari and Roasted Tomatoes - Perfectly cooked crispy Skate wing. Dee-Lish.Pig Face with Crispy potatoes - this dish was essentially a roulade made from the braised meat of the Pig's Head. Very good flavor with a nice contrast of Â texture from the matchstick potatoes.Lamb Rib Chops - These were nicely prepared. The flavor was mild for lamb and the ribs were meltingly tender. Goat Cheese Pizza with figs - this was solid. I wouldn't go out of my way to order, but it's a nice dish to share. We spent $38 a person for four people. Not that bad at all. I will look forward to going back and taking the gf.G&TG is AGAIG. Google it."
"We waited three months to get into The Girl and The Goat and had a lot of anticipation built up. Â Sadly, it didn't meet our expectations very well. Â There is way too much hype about this restaurant and I am surprised by how many excellent reviews there are on here. Â It's not bad, but it's nothing outstanding. It is way over priced, and the food, frankly, is just okay. Â  The dishes sound unique, but they just fell flat. Â The green beans, chick pea fritters and pork shank were by far the best dishes of the eight dishes we tried. Â We tried three desserts as well, and they were good, but nothing remarkable, or that we hadn't tried somewhere else. Â The service was good, but it was so loud and crowded the entire time we were in there that if felt like we were shouting at one another. Â It was very distracting. Â There are just way too many other excellent restaurants in Chicago that outshine this one. Â Try North Pond if you're looking for something outstanding where you can peacefully enjoy your meal, savor the flavors and feel that it's worth every penny."
"Definitely lives up to the hype! I would order 90% of what we ordered again. I would avoid the ham fries. They weren't great, and it's such a big portion compared to the other dishes. I also personally wouldn't order the pig face again, but it came out at the end of the meal and I was already stuffed, so that could have had something to do with it. They also change how it is cooked so I might try it again if it was done differently. I LOVED the crab and corn dish, the pork belly and sushi type dish and the escargot w/ goat balls (I know, EW, but they were surprisingly good!) The decor was really cool and seeing the chef's in the kitchen is always fun. Our server was knowledgeable and very nice. A great evening!"
"I echo all the positive reviews of this place. Â Highlights:1. Â Our waitress was outstanding. Â We ordered all of our dishes at the same time and she organized them like a pro. Â 2. Â The chickpea fritters. Â I don't know how they managed to make each chickpea crispy.3. The mussels were fresh and tender.4. Â The honeycrisp soup. Â Wow. Â Tart and rich. 5. The best of 3 cocktail. Â 6. Â The ambiance felt modern yet very cozy and comfortable.7. Â The ONLY dish that wasn't a hit was the ham frites. Â It was quite a greasy mess. Â It seemed like we got the dregs of the barrel. Would not order them again.All in all, an outstanding experience. Â Now, if only I can get a reservation at a normal time..."
"I love animals. THEY ARE DELICIOUS. And how could you not love a place that serves pig face? It takes a miracle (or several weeks) to get a table before 10 pm, but we decided to take our chances and put our name in. Fortunately we were able to get a spot at the bar, and after a couple of the Aviator cocktails (SOOOOO good! Even better than Perrenial).We could see Stephanie buzzing around her kitchen (and the dining room) - it was king of cool to be so close to someone so talented and famous. She is very deserving of every good thing that comes her way!On to the food...Unfortunately, one person in our party was not up to ordering the pig face, but we did order the ravioli, scallops, lamb shank, roasted cauliflower (incredible!). The flavors were simple but complex at the same time...perfect portions too. Someone nearby was having a pizza that looked delicious, so maybe next time (a couple years from now when the wait isn't 5 weeks) I'll try that!"
"I had to keep rescheduling my reservation for G&G but finally went a few weeks ago...it was worth the wait! The hostesses were very friendly, offering to take my coat right away. Our table wasn't quite ready so we sat at the bar and ordered a drink (only sat for about 2 minutes). Our waitress was friendly and helpful with picking menu items. They were out of a few things which was a bit disappointing but our reservation was for 11:30pm, and they ran out at 6pm. We ordered roasted cauliflower, wood grilled broccoli, specialty bread, leg of lamb (I think), and duck empanadas. Can't quite remember the names of our drinks, but both were very good. We didn't get dessert because we were too full, but next time we will. I will definitely be going back! I'd love to go earlier this time so we don't miss out on anything!"
"The food makes my heart skip a beat! You can't go wrong with anything you order. Warm buttery breads that are irresistible, every plate I've consumed have been incendiary flavors of joy."
"Just ate here last week. Â I don't feel I need to add anything about the food, other than Â I agree with so many of the positive reviews already posted. Â Great ambience, very nice staff. Â The people who work here seem to enjoy themselves, which really contributes the vibe.Anyone else notice the music, though? Â Kind of like Stephanie I. might be playing her own i-pod, which (the night we were there) reminded me of my freshman year of college, circa 1996. Â Think Counting Crows and Natalie Merchant. Â Really, Stephanie? Â Love me some 10,000 Maniacs but....huh?"
"We came here a few months ago and there are still some things that stick out in my mind. The first of which is how approachable and cool Stephanie was. We had a large table by the kitchen and she was very visible, took a picture with our group and chatted for a while with us. We were fans of her on the show and she was just as nice in person. At least for the five minutes she spent with us. The other thing that stood out was the place itself. i really liked the ambiance. As for the food, there were some things I enjoyed and some that were ok. Hiramisa crudo was quite good. I wish there was more of it. Crispy Pig face was really tasty, fatty but not too fatty. The sugo dish, the soft shell crab, and the prawn stuffed with duck I enjoyed as well. Some of the misses for me were the octopus, too salty and the goat pizza. Pizza was ok, nothing very remarkable about it. We also tried all of the breads, which were good. Some raw oysters, good but nothing terribly special. The rabbit rillette was just ok, I like rabbit, but I didn't expect the consistency of this one. All in all, a great time with good, interesting food."
"Henri:The atmosphere, the service, and by-god the food. All get my recommendation whenever someone asks where to go. Always a rotating menu and a great wine list, and did I mention helpful and friendly staff. I have never eaten at a table here preferring the couch nook near the front (to your left upon entering). Great place to meet people have interesting food you CANNOT get anywhere else and ingest a few libations. Here's just a taste of the last time we went...Wheat bread w/ banana/bacon butter; Scallions; chickpea fritters, lemon goat sausage and croutons, muscles, baked peppers in a rich light creme sauce, flour-less chocolate crumbles with salt and shitake gelato. ...and if I die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take me to Girl and the Goat one last time.Nicole:One of my absolute favorite restaurants in Chicago! Â The staff is so sweet and attentive! Â The wine selection IMHO is okay but the food is hands down AMAZING. Â I agree with my hubby it is a great place to meet up with friends and family because everything is served ""family style"" and portions are not huge so you get to try a lot of different things. Â They are always rotating out breads and spreads, and I have not had one I did not love yet (and we've been going since they opened). Â My favorites are the chickpea fritters, sauteed green beans, peppers, steamed mussels, and grilled beef short ribs. Â Every time the staff recommend something I have not been disappointed. Â I really love this restaurant!"
"I have never been so excited to try a restaurant as I was to try Girl and the Goat. Â We were going there to celebrate my birthday, so it was extra exciting for me. Â It is located only a little over half a mile from the train station, so it was awesome for us coming from the suburbs. Â However, it was a warm night, so that might not have been a good idea because it was a little hot in there.When we walked in, I really felt like a little kid in a candy store. Â We got there about 20 mins before our reservation, so we checked in and decided to get a drink. Â The wine and beer selection was wonderful. Â Of course, there was not your typical selection. Â I love to try new things though, so I was all for it. Â The bar area was a little tight but we watched all the food come out and got even more excited to sit down.It was finally our time to sit down. Â I could not wait to figure out what we were going to eat. Â There was a group of 6 of us, so we decided to get a bunch of different selections. Â Our server was awesome! Â She put in the food orders, so they would come out in rounds and not all at once. Â It was wonderful. Looking at the menu might be a little scary with some of the combinations. Â You have to keep an open mind in trying them though. Â They are all totally worth it!!Even if you don't like green beans, you have to get them. Â They are amazing!!! Â The escargot and goatballs were one of my favorite dishes of the night! Â The crisp soft shell crap was awesome. Â The goat pizza, the ham frites, rabbit rillette, and pork liver mousseline were delicious. Â The night would not have been complete if we didn't try the Crispy Pig Face. Â I enjoyed it but a couple people eating it thought it was a little too greasy. Â The night started winding down when they brought out the goat cheese bavaroise with a candle in it for dessert! Â It was outstanding. Â I didn't really want to share, but I was stuffed so I did! Â My amazing night ended with Stephanie taking a picture with us. Â I could not have been happier that night! Â It was the best birthday meal I could have asked for!I can't wait to go back because the menu changes for the season. Â The ingredients come from local farmers, so it is varies and changes. Â It is definitely a reason to go back for more!"
"Came here twice, first for my husband's bday and then just with some friends. I would actually do 4.5 because everything was great but a place has to blow me out of the water to get a true 5It is a large, lively space, great food. The first time we sat by the chef's table, which is well worth it if you can get a seat there. These are counter seats for two where you get to sit by the kitchen, watch and interact with the chefs. Read: samples!Food is great, Asian influences in some of the ingredients/sauces. Fave dishes: green beans in fish sauce with nuts, pig face. The menu is rotational and seasonal which is awesome. They even had Ramps, a springtime only veg in some dishes last time I was there.Solid cocktails, good craft brews, and genuine service. Altogether a great restaurant. Book ahead their reservations fill up fast and for good reason!"
"Im writing this review a little late, but this place left such an impression, I wanted to be sure to leave a shout out! As im sure everyone know by now, the food is outstanding. I think my favorite dish was the green beans. The bread was amazing too. However, I would say the most outstanding part of my experience was the service. It was a busy night (when is it not???) and we were at a small table for two, but still had exceptional service. I can't remember our servers name, but we came on Halloween and he was dressed as Pauly D (hilarious)."
"I finally got to try this place. On an off chance, I looked on Opentable and scored a 7pm table for the next night. And to make that even better, we scored the KITCHEN TABLE!! It's the seat where you actually sit on the line and watch them prepare the dishes in front of you. I've heard it's impossible to get, but if you can, do! Their tables look super comfy as well with really big cushion-y chairs. On to the food! Listen to everyone on here and get the Cauliflower and Green beans. We loved them. We also tried the chickpea dish and thought it tasted really fresh. I had the pork belly and loved it, but the bf was not as keen on it. We also had the scallops (not the best) but ok. The goat pizza is fantastic and I think I would go back for that alone!! Get it!! Â We had one of the breads with the fresh spreads...not really anything to write home about and I would rather have gotten another vegetable. This place is reasonable for the price and we walked out only spending $130, and that was 7 dishes and 4 total beers later. Not bad!! Overall, I was really pleased with this place. Atmosphere was cool, seat was even cooler and the food was fantastic!"
"First visit/good impression. Â  We were a little late for our 5pm reservation on a rainy Wednesday night. Â  Â I waited about 10 mins for my friend to arrive. Â  Had a unique (and delicious) cocktail $13!! Â  She arrived & ordered a drink $11. Â  Got our table and met our server, Lisa, who was friendly and outgoing and made some great suggestions. Â  Overall impression of restaurant is hip & trendy (goes without saying), really dark and very loud -- made louder last night when the smoke alarm went off (for a very loud 15 minutes) and we were visited by two truckloads of firemen. Â  Â All was well and it just added to the experience. Â Here's what we ordered: Â  parmesean crusted bread (super delicious) with 2 dips: garlic oil and white anchovy butter. Â Next was an order of chickpea fritters. Â  The roasted cauliflower appetizer. Â  Two jumbo scallops on a bed of slaw with crispy pig ear garnish. Â And to finish -- ribs (a special on last night's menu). Â  Goat ribs I guess but very tasty! Â  Crispy outside and fall off the bone tender. Â  Â Would have loved dessert but we were too full. Â  I still dream about the gelato flavors from her former restaurant (Scylla) and plan to go back and try more items. Â  A very lively and delicious experience. Â  Probably very expensive but my friend picked up the tab for my birthday (thank you, Kathy). Â  The worst part is still no taxis to be found on west Randolph & had to hoof it with seconds to spare to make my train at Union Station. Â  C'mon taxi drivers. Â  Â West Randolph/west loop is hopping at night. Â  Â Get over there."
"Service - Did not make a reservation but hostess was very hospitable and friendly, even though it was a busy night. Â Got my boyfriend and me a table as soon as she could. Â Ambiance - Enjoyed the lighting and decor but the tables were placed way too closely to each other...chairs easily bumped into each other.Food - One of my boyfriend's colleagues has a girlfriend who works there as a chef. Â Thought we'd check it out, plus I checked the reviews here and people were raving about it. Â I'm a major foodie so I had to pay a visit. Â Bread - toasted way too hard, like biting into a rock. Â The miso-peanut spread tasted weird. Â Chickpea Fritter - Excellent. Â The best dish of the night.Oysters - Totally not worth it. Â Small. Â Not memorable.Pork Cheeks - Okay. Â Flavor was good but the texture was strange, kind of slimy.Scallops - HORRIBLE. Â The scallops were overcooked and the sauce they were in just didn't work. Â It had a strange, sour flavor to it. Â Why did I give this restaurant a 2? Â My boyfriend and I both felt sick after our meal. Â He felt okay the next day but I had a stomach virus from it and I hugged the toliet for a total of 5 days. Â I was so sick that I checked into the ER to see if the doctors could do anything to help me, but they really couldn't do much because it was a stomach virus and a virus has to run its course to clear out. Â :( Â Meal was way too expensive for what we got PLUS the extra medical cost puts us over the edge. Â Technically I should give Girl and the Goat a 0 or 1 star but to be fair there were some things they did right. Â It's unfortunate that we, especially me, got sick from eating there. Â Hope this doesn't happen to anyone else."
"Girl and the Goat did not live up to expectations. First of all, reservations are impossible to get. Like a 2 month lead time for an 8 o'clock res. Yikes. Secondly, it's a little down market. Beyond casual, get them in and get them out sort of vibe. Â But with all that said, it is tasty (although not THAT good for the hassle) The pig face was the best plate.This place is best for a super casual night out with friends."
"Sucka Free! I don't know why that applies here.. but after heaing it on MTV a few years back this is what I scream out when something is really that good. Gotta thank my sis for getting a reservation as I heard its quite the ordeal to get one. Food Â - Pretty Amazing, They serve tapas here - so order a bunch and share. The Pizza and Clam dish was really good. Didnt feel the froi gras tho. Service - Good stuff, even recommended places to party after. Ambiance - Packed and Loud! My kinda joint. Alcohol - Great craft beer selectionPrice - A bit on the high side but guess what thats how Top Chef joints are, so pony up the dough and enjoy the ride.P.S. Â I really loved the huge Girl and the Goat painting!!!!"
"The food was awesome, but that's not what this review is about. Â There are plenty of food reviews below (though get the pig face and soft shell crab). Â This review is about the service.We got there for 7pm reservations and we waited in the bar until 745pm. Â I was pissed. Â Plus the place was loud, which I am not a big fan of.BUT, when we sat down our waiter instantly apologized for the wait (the hostess had already apologized, but that's standard hostess stuff) and said that the manager would like to buy us a round of drinks. Â Wait a minute, now we're getting somewhere. Â That was out of the blue. Â We hadn't bitched. Â So now they've dug their way out of the hole.Our waiter, Meadows, was awesome. Â The place was very busy and he did a great job of checking in with us. Â I've had worse service from places that were half empty. Â He was great and his recommendations were spot on.On top of that, the manager checked in with us and the hostess remembered us on the way out and thanked us for being patient.Bottom line is that while they may be still working out some opening bumps and they are getting slammed while they are the hot new place, they are working their asses off to make it good. Â Mission accomplished.(and the food rocks)"
3 visits to date and I couldn't more satisfied. Â The sugo might be my favorite food in the world.
"My jacket still smells of the delicious wood oven as I write this. We had reservation at 9 and had to wait 10 minutes on a wed(no biggie). Â Ordered some Choco bread and a bottle of Malbec. Bread was OK. Now on to the food:Chickpea Fritters: FantasticScallops: Best I've had in a while but needed more pumpkin goodnessShrimp: Again, best I've had in a while and cooked to perfectionSkirt Steak: Portion was way to small(and skirt steak is so cheap) but tasted amazing. And the beets with it rocked.Smoked Goat Pizza: This came out last and was super rich so we ended up taking most of it home. But it was fantastic!!Server was cool and didn't end up spending as much as I thought I would. Now I can see what all the hype is about. Only complaint is that a little heavy handed with the salt for my taste. And If I'm dropping $$, give me the bread for free already."
"Top Chef Stephanie Izard is amazing! Girl and the Goat is a great restaurant to take out-of-towners that want to try something new and innovative. Just be sure to make reservations way in advance. The way the menu is set up, I think it's best to go with a group of four. We ordered way too much for the two of us, but really wanted to try everything. We had the:pig faceoctopushangar steakfried well fleet oysterssweet potato au gratinbread w/bacon butterSome dishes were absolutely fantastic, while others I felt were not worth trying again.First tip, don't bother ordering the bread. If I'm paying $4 for bread at a restaurant, I expect it to be pretty darn good. The bacon butter congealed by the end of the meal and did not look so appetizing.The fried oysters were my absolute favorite. They were served on the half shell on a bed of crab/egg salad. Â The pig face lived up to the rave reviews. It was sweet, savory, and crispy. Sweet potato au gratin was also nice and creamy. The sweet potatoes are a nice touch. The hangar steak was disappointing. Hopefully they'll change up the beef option soon. Although the restaurant was dimly lit to give off a nice romantic touch, the noise level was pretty loud. We had to shout at each other the whole time."
"No words. Exceeded my expectations and they were pretty high to begin with. I recommend the scallops, soft shell crab, confit goat belly, roasted cauliflower and bittersweet chocolate dessert.Food: 5 starsService: 4 starsAmbience: 4 stars Price: on the pricey side (although not really compared to restaurants of a similar caliber), but totally worth itFor an extensive review: caseycooks.com/2011/07/dâ¦"
amazing experience. crudo and fried oysters were surprisingly delicious. the goat pattee is a must order (never had anything like it before). service was spectacular.
"Nothing I can contribute will make a dent in any of the pages upon pages of reviews, but I had to toss my .02 in. I wished each of these dishes were three times larger and solely for me.Standouts for me were the oyster (with horseradish) whose name I have forgotten, the squash rangoon, and the goat belly. There was a dessert our friends got with a brownie underneath some marshmallow/heaven combo that I could have eaten multiples of as well. The octopus was good as well, but was the one dish that had a bit too much salt. I tend to notice salt a lot more than others, though. My only regret is not putting my foot down and making the table order bread. I dearly love my carbs, and I think it would have filled me up a bit more. Overall I left satiated, but was hungry a few hours later. We were fortunate enough to get a walk-in on a Tuesday night with only an hour wait, so no real complaints from me. Wait staff knew their stuff and the dishes were well paced."
"OK, this restaurant has received beaucoup fanfare because the owner was on some ""Iron Chef"" style program and won some award for it. I was in Chicago last week and found out about the establishment based on a review of it in Ask.com. Here's my review. This restaurant gets crowded quickly! We arrived at 5pm on a Friday and the place was PACKED to the gills! Â I was with my friend and the only room available to sit was to the side of the restaurant on one of their couches. Fine. The dishes are served TAPAS style. Our enthusiastic waitress encouraged us to order a number of dishes. Each dish must be rated on its own because NOT all dishes are a HIT. Some are indeed, MISSES. For example, we had a dish called warm oven roasted pig faceWith a description like that, how can you not be curious as to what this pig will be doing starring at you on the plate? Â We ordered it and what we got was nothing special. It was pork, with an egg cracked over it. It tasted fine but did not merit any special accolades. The grilled baby octopus was a disappointment. I wanted a grilled baby octopus not something that was cut up in a lots of tiny pieces mixed in with veggies. A good grilled octopus stands fine on its own and properly cooked and seasoned, is delicious! Â The woodfired wellfleet oysters were very good. But not many came with the dish (it was an appetizer). The prawn dish we ordered was super as was the pan roasted baramundi. Both dishes were flavorful and expertly prepared. Thumbs up!The desserts were a terrible disappointment. Only four were listed and we definitely chose the wrong ones. Â They badly need a dessert chef who can create the kinds of desserts I've experienced back here in San Francisco. Â One minus for the waitress. She encouraged us to order a dessert. My friend ordered his and didn't like it. She charged us for anyway. IMO, that lacks class.All in all, if you don't mind the crowds (and since most of you are foodies anyway) go try the Girl and the Goat. Not every dish is a hit but if you choose well, you will eat well. This restaurant still needs some fine tuning on its menu selection but if you have money to blow, then go for it and check out the girl and the goat!"
"This is the most unpretentious, delicious restaurant I have ever been to.I figured this out when I realized that my husband and I were practically up to our elbows in the very best wings I have ever eaten. Â  I can't even describe them - they aren't buffalo wings. Â  But, there was delicious blue cheese, veal italian sausage and an amazing sauce. Â My husband ended up taking our bread (which was a very very good rye), and sopping up the ""gravy"" out of the bowl. Â  I felt like we had food that we'd never had before, in a fun, relaxed and even sexy environment."
"Shut the front door, Yelpers, and get thee to Girl & the Goat. Holy meat, holy fish and holy vegetables... a trifecta of foodie delight. Every aspect of G&G is perfection - ambiance, style, service, food, drink and location. Favorite dishes were hands-down the Pigs Face (really, just try it), the green beans and smoked goat pizette. I didn't love the soft shell crab, but it wasn't awful either. My malbec was paired to perfection with everything.I'm honestly salivating as I write this review and uber excited to return!"
"I was hoping for a 5 star experience, and I have to admit, I was somewhat disappointed. I think I had too high expectations b/c of all the hype. Nonetheless, the food was a weak 4 stars overall. The low down: 1) Fat Bread -- The white bread was extremely soft with a hard crust. We actually preferred the accompanying plum chutney over the much raved about liver butter, but both accompaniments were good. 2) Sauteed Green Beans -- This was the second best dish of the night. The green beans were crispy and went well with the modified fish sauce and cashews. The drizzled aioli was a nice touch. Â 3) Seared Scallops -- This was the best dish of all. It was HEAVEN in my mouth. The scallop and veal were a perfect match. The flavor crash almost touched the awesomeness of Carnivale's Ropa Vieja.......not quite, but almost. 4) Ham Frites -- This was the biggest disappointment for me. It tasted like regular fries with intense seasoning served with tomato aioli and melted Swiss cheese for dipping. I felt McDonald's fries were better. (Yikes, Stephanie, I'm sorry). 5) Smoked Goat Pizzette -- Interesting blend of flavors, but nothing I'll crave for later. There was plenty of goat meat on the pizza (no skimping here), so I was quite impressed with that. I thought the food was ""interesting"" but in a good way. If it weren't for the scallops, I probably would give this place 3 stars (hence the weak 4 star rating). Overall, I think this is a great place to ""shock"" your palette once in a blue moon with a new, exciting blend of flavors. But the excitement doesn't hold for me......."
Great place to go with a group.Fun combinations of food.Everything is tasty.Be daring....try something fantastic like the pigface!!!The serves are knowledgeable and the wine choices made by the sommelier was paired perfectly with the meal.A full bar is available for your enjoyment too!I can't wait to go back again!!!!
"Does Girl & the Goat really need another review, probably not. Instead here is what we had:-Bread with a liver pate (It was ok, nothing memorable)-Squash blossom rangoon . crab . chive yogurt . roasted almonds (Possibly the best thing all night. definitely rivaled the pig face)-confit goat belly . bourbon butter . lobster n' crab . fennel (amazing!)-wered lamb heart . sweetbread crisp . potato aioli . ramps . strawberry (the husband absolutely loved it! the strawberries were such an unexpectedly delicious addition)-wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix (seriously amazing. tender, beautifully cooked egg and mixed all together was perfection.)-ganache pork fat doughnuts . yuzu blackberries . salted oat streusel . malted vanilla gelato-goat cheese bavarois . brown sugar cake . citrus blueberries . macron caramel(Both deserts were phenomenal and not too sweet)- a bottle of 'Girl & the Goat 2009 red wine' from Walla walla valleyTo sum it up: Be adventurous, try something you would never typically eat and just have fun with it. And more importantly, here is a full review on the visual treat that is Izard's restaurant:kaper22.blogspot.com/201â¦"
"What a great restaurant!My fiance took me here a few weeks ago for a belated birthday celebration. Â We were lucky enough to be seated up at one of the chef's table and were able to see all the action on the line. Â It happened to be the first night Chef Izard was working on the line and she happened to be manning the grill right in front of us! Â It was our lucky night =)Food was amazing. Â Our server was super sweet and attentive. Â And the cooks all have such a great personality, that it made our dining experience there even more fun. Â I think besides a great menu, the fun and friendly personable dining staff/cooks really sets girl and the goat on another level for me. Â Stephanie was also so friendly and fun to chat with and her food just shows how super talented she is. Â We left there completely stuffed! Â Besides the items we ordered, Stephanie gave us a taste of so many other dishes on the menu, I thought I had died and gone to foodie heaven. Â I feel like alot of times a restaurant opens and they concentrate so much on the main food menu, they kinda forget about the bread and dessert. Â But at girl and the goat, every aspect of their menu is amazing! Â And can I just say, I love carbs. Â Bread is my friend. Â And the bread here was ridiculously good. Â After seeing me going crazy over dipping the bread in the bacon compote, my fiance just told me to finish it off, because it was just so tasty, and i couldn't restrain myself. Â And for dessert, we ordered the bittersweet chocolate and shittake gelato. Â yes, shitake gelato. Â Sounds a little nuts, but it complemented the chocolate so well. Â And Stephanie gave us a bowl of fatback gelato to try too. Â Mmmm.... who knew fatback gelato could be so tasty. Â Can't wait to go back! Â  Â  Â FAVORITES OF THE NIGHT:Bread: Â -House cultured butter and beer-bacon compote Oysters: -Egg salad and capersSalad: -Shaved kohlrabi salad, fennel, evalon, toasted sliced almonds . ginger dressingVeggies: -Roasted cauliflower with picked peppers, pine nuts, mint (Never liked cauliflower, but damn, this is good!)Seafood:-Grilled baby octopus, serrano, treviso, celery root, braised pistachio, red bliss potato (i could live off this stuff. so good!)Meat: -Grilled pork ribs with tomatillo mushroom slaw, grilled scallion vinaigrette (so amazingly tender)-Grilled skirt steak, chiogga beets, house pickles, wilted romaine, salted goat milk caramel (sooooooo good! Â I'm craving it now just talking about it.)-Beef tongue (I was scared and skeptical, but Stephanie assured me that I would like it, and I did!) Dessert: Â -Bittersweet chocolate, shitake gelato, toffee creme fraiche (And order the french press coffee with dessert. Â It just tastes so good together. Â Coffee and the sweet yumminess.)"
"Being a big fan of Top Chef, I knew I wanted to check out Girl & the Goat when we were in town for New Years. I made a reservation about 2 months in advance and even then there was spotty availability! Luckily I found a table for 4 at 8p. Walking in, I was in awe. It is one of the coolest restaurants I've been in. We got seated fairly quickly and from that point on we had amazing service. I think every time I took a sip of water it was refilled - not in an annoying way - but in a this-is-the-best-service-I've-ever-experienced kind of way. We ordered 8-10 dishes, all fabulous. Lots of ""this-is-the-best-thing-I've-ever-eaten"" comments were made throughout the night. Even though the pig face sounds terrifying, try it. SO good!"
"We were in Chicago for a wedding and decided to take that opportunity to try Girl and the Goat. Â Kudos to chef Stephanie Izard for getting such amazing recognition lately. Â I'm a Top Chef fan, and she often gets overlooked as the person who won only because the favorite had a meltdown in the finale. Â Having now had her food, I can attest that it was delicious! Â I like the concept of the restaurant, with the menu organized by the dominant ingredient in the dish--veggie, fish, and meat. Â I also like the small plates design because then you can try more of the options! Â Favorites included the bread course, the scallops, and the goat, pork, and veal sugo. Â Excellent service and atmosphere, even at 4:30--which is when we had to eat to still catch our flight that night! Â I was in a happy-food-induced nap state the whole flight :)"
"Yes, this place is as great as you've heard and completely lives up to the hype. Some of the best food I have ever eaten and most certainly the best in Chicago. All of the dishes were superb, but a couple of stand outs were the incredible oysters and the pig face hash. Delicious.The sommelier was also excellent and really helped us to find a great wine within our price range (he didn't try and over sell the more expensive ones, like some sommeliers can tend to do). Go here as soon as you can get a reservation - we booked in Feb for this table in June!!"
"Anything with over 1600 reviews and 4+ stars is worth checking out!We were seated outside and were in the middle of dinner when the rain began, and staff did not have a solution for us! We had to stand in the middle of the restaurant for 30 minutes before they gave our party of 4 space at the bar counter with 3 standing and 1 chair. I understand that the rain was unexpected, but for such an (expensive) hot spot they really should be prepared for this kind of situation. Especially since it happens so often in Chicago. They offered us complimentary cocktails while we waited, but for this kind of restaurant I expected more. Some staff were hardly apologetic saying, ""We have what we have."", and that is pretty much unacceptable. The food is very interesting and hit or miss based on personal taste. My general complaint is that overall the food is over salted. We ordered: mushroom soup bread, frog legs, beet salad, hot peppers, pork belly, sun fish, beef tongue, pig face, and the pasta. The sun fish was my number 1 and I actually licked the plate, with a second place going to the hot peppers. Â The pigs face was my least favorite, another overly salted. The frog leg meat was good too, but also too much salt.The drinks are innovative and tasty so try them. Desert looked uninspiring so we passed. Overall the food is very unique and has many choices which I have never had the opportunity to try! This won't be a regular spot for me but it is fun to try once and experience what they have to offer."
"I was slightly skeptical before going to Girl and the Goat. I read some slightly negative reviews and was worried that the hype was more impressive than the food. I was more impressed than I could have expected. My husband and I pride ourselves on our picky palates and I have to say, Girl and the Goat quickly topped my list of amazing Chicago restaurants. We started off with the amazing Duck Fat Bread. You do have to put more butter on the bread to get the full taste of the duck fat. However, it was still amazing. I do wish we would have tried the tomato bread. We also got the goat empanadas (to die for), diver scallops, cauliflower, and Walter's chicken. Each of those options were easily some of the best dishes I have had in Chicago. The ONLY thing I was not a fan of were the fried pickles. The pickling juice on the pickles was a little too pungent for my taste. However, the pickled peppers on the cauliflower were spot on and made the dish. The table next to us ordered the grilled octopus and said it was amazing and perfectly Â cooked. Drink wise we stuck to craft beer. They have a solid selection and I enjoyed both of my options. In addition, the coffee we had at the end of the meal was bold in flavor but perfectly brewed without that burnt flavor you get at many restaurants. We were way too full to even attempt dessert or cheese. Overall, I would say it was one of the best dining experiences I have had in Chicago."
"Never disappointed, except for the dessert (which is consistently disappointing). The chickpea patty is pure savory perfection, and is the crudo is the definition of balance. The menu changes, but do not avoid getting the vegetable and fish dishes just because the restaurant is known for it's goat dishes (which, by the way, are also divine). This place is a total gem."
"What a delightful dining experience from start to finish!The Girl and the Goat lives up to all the hype and more. Â I went here last night with a group of four and we had a great time enjoying the ambiance, the views, the drinks, the delicious food and the great service. A great place for a date or an outing with a group of friends. Â We arrived early to have a couple coctails before dinner. The bartender rocked and poured us some strong drinks. We were seated at the exact time of our reservation. Our waitress Danielle was amazing. She was so attentive and gave good recommendations.So here is the recap of our food experience. We were a group of four and Danielle recommended that we order 2-3 dishes per person. The food is served in small portion tapas style. Well, since we hadn't really eaten all day, we ordered over 10 items plus 4 desserts...and ate every bite!The menu is divided into three sections: V (Vegetarian), F(Fish) and M (Meat).We started off with a couple orders of oysters. We had the raw ones and fried ones. Both were delicous and enjoyed by every member of our group of four.From the V menu we ordered the following: -Honey crisp soup . brown butter . tarragon yogurt. OMG, this soup is AMAZING. I could have eaten two orders of it. It's light and so flavorful. Great for fall.-Sauteed green beans . fish sauce vinaigrette. This was delicious and paired well with the skirt steak we ordered.-Kabocha squash ravioli . mushroom raisin ragout . brussels leaves . shroom creme fraiche. LOOOOVED every bite of this.From the F menu we got the following (that I remember!)-Seared scallops. pumpkin brandade . pecans . fried brussels sprouts . tarragon . pomegranate. These were perfectly prepared!-Lamb sausage stuffed calamari . sweet garlic . sweetbread crisp . currant saor. I'm a huge lamb fan, so hands down this was a party in my mouth!Whole fried loup de mer . button clams . guanicale . celery root. DELIC!From the M menu we got: -Skirt steak a la planca . chiogga beets . house pickles . wilted romaine . salted goat milk caramel. This dish was a little salty but the meat was tender-Wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix. Okay, I admit it. I was SUPER terrified to try this but took one for the team. And it ended up being my favorite dish. GET IT!Dessert:We ordered all four. My fave one was the bittersweet chocolate with shitake geletto. We also liked the blood orange gelato. I didn't care too much for the dessert with the dates although I love dates. ANd then we got the dessert w/the apple in it- that was pretty yummy too. I pretty much feel like we ordered the menu. If you come hungry you will leave very full. Although the dishes are all pretty small, the lamb shank is pretty big. We didn't order this but saw other tables had it. The menu is seasonal, I can't wait to go back for their winter menu:)"
"By now the hype at Girl and Goat is legendary. Â Yes I made reservations two months ago. Â Yes as soon as I walked in I asked myself, ""Where's Stephanie"". Â Yes my mouth was salivating hours before my (admittedly) early reservation. Â After all that build up, I don't think anything could have lived up to my expectations. Â The menu was exciting enough. Â So many ingredients and terms that I had no clue about. Â I was frantically googling travieso and sugo whilst not letting the waiter in on my ignorance.Finally we settled on the pigs in a blanket bread, grilled octopus, sambocha ravioli, goat empanadas and pig face. Â Octopus and pig face were pretty good, but the ravioli was perplexing. Â So many ingredients and flavors and it ended up tasting like a sweet/salty/stewy mess.The atmosphere was great; the whole restaurant was buzzing with excitement and a very laid-back, non-fussy atmosphere. Â Our waiter as helpful and friendly, but perhaps a little too eager. Â The food was spaced out a bit awkwardly -- the first two dishes came out at the same time but the last two took nearly 20 minutes each.Ultimately, the best and worst thing I can say about the restaurant was that I was eager to return to try the other things on the menu which speaks highly to the creativity and excitement of the food, but not so highly of the food I actually consumed....and where's Stephanie?"
"Well it's been a few months since I was here. This outstanding gem of a restaurant is still very prevalent on my mind with how wonderful the food was. If I lived in Chicago, I'd try and come here at least once a month, if I wasn't able to come here once a week. Definitely, one of the best restaurants I've ever been to solely based on the taste of the food.You can definitely see how Stephanie won Top Chef. NOTE: I'm really only going to review the food here and that is the primary basis of my rating.My memory is a little hazy given the time span that has passed since coming here, but let me just indulge anyone willing to read this about what I know I tasted.Roasted Cauliflower - I can feel the saliva in mouth build up just thinking about how delicious this was. Now, I'm very much a bit biased in regards to this dish as cauliflower ranks as one of my favorite vegetables (only carrots and Brussels sprouts are higher...yes, I know I was probably a weird kid for liking these things most kids despised), but this was by far the best vegetable dish I've eaten in my life. It was nutty Â and spicy. the cauliflower was cooked just perfectly where it had a nice snap and crunch do it, but still cooked just enough so there was no 'raw' taste to it. The mint provided this nice little refreshing burst in your mouth to offset some of the mild heat of the pickled peppers yet not over power the dish in any way. There was a little bit of an oiliness to the dish that wasn't off putting like you would think. I know, when someone says oily, it's usually a bad thing...not here though. Here, it was just enough to really coat your tongue with all the flavors of the dish and hold them there for you to enjoy and you chewed and crunched. The dish wasn't too heavy yet it still had good substance. I could have easily ordered another 2 plates of this. Sauteed Green Beans - I've read the other reviews on this dish; ranting and raving about how delicious it was and yes, I agree the dish is easily very very delicious. There really isn't much else to say about it. The only thing I will say though was that it didn't impress me nearly as much as the cauliflower. Really, this reminded me of a very similar Chinese style (which style of Chinese cuisine you ask? I couldn't tell you...it was whichever my mother cooked when I as a wee lad) green bean dish I grew up eating. It was nice in that it brought a certain sense of nostalgia for me as I ate it. Yet, at the same time, it wasn't a new flavor to me and left me wishing there was a bit more 'new' with it. Don't let that detract you from trying it though! It was still one of my favorite dishes of that night and very delicious. Wood Oven Roasted Pig Face - Don't let the name scare you. Most Foodies will tell you, the cheeks of an animal are some of the best tasting parts of the animal and boy is that true for this pig. This was definitely one of the richer dishes on the menu, but that's to be expected for a main course dish (especially one with my favorite four legged food). The pig face meat was tender and moist and absolutely delicious. The sunny side egg on top added a nice layer of rich velvety goodness to contrast with the texture of the meat. The spices and seasoning were spot on and everything just melded altogether very nicely and lastly the potato sticks added some nice crunch to the dish (and what dish can't use some crunch?). I'd say the only disappointing thing about this dish was that it wasn't the whole head of the pig being brought to the table (though, for many that would actually be a plus).Confit Goat Belly - Now, you go to a place called Girl and the GOAT and the place has a dedicated part of the menu entirely to goat...you have to try the goat then, right? Absolutely! I'm just going to caveat this part of the review with the fact that I've always been of the belief that Americans simply do not eat enough goat. In my opinion goat is one of the most delicious meats on the planet and should not have this weird stigma that it does amongst the appetites of the average American. For those of you whom never had goat before, try it! Goat is fairly lean and has a much milder taste than lamb, so you aren't going to have to deal with any sort of gaminess that a lot of people seem to fear. So back to the dish itself. This is confit goat in a bourbon butter sauce permeating its through to it's core. It comes with crab and lobster and is perfectly seasoned with plenty of herbs and spices. The meat was fork tender and very easily one of the most delicious bites of goat I've ever had the honor of placing in my mouth. Really...must I go on with how delicious this dish was? It's amazing, I fear I'm reaching my word limit on this review. So I leave this off with a simple, come here, eat a lot and enjoy yourself! (I had a lot of other food here, but these 4 dishes were the real standouts for me. Thanks for reading if you did!"
"So, while I feel like I'm one of the last people in Chicago to try this place and review it, I'm still going to throw my opinion out there. The food is without a doubt delicious. But the use of the word magical to describe this place seems to be going a bit too far. So here's the breakdown of what we ordered:Chickpea fritters - I thought these would be like falafel, which are also fried chickpeas though it was nothing like it. Crispy fried outside and a light, smooth center. Very flavorful and very delicious. A great vegetarian item though meatless items can never out-rank anything with meat in my bookGoat liver mousse pate - Definitely one of the lighter pates I've had before. It was very good but didn't taste much different than pates I've had elsewhere. It came with these small fried dough balls which were good, but between the fried dough and the pate it was a bit of a savory overload.Pig face - This is the item everyone seemed to rave about. I'm not sure if it's because people are impressed with themselves that they tried and actually liked pig face so they feel the need to brag or what the deal is. Either way, it was very good. The meat came in a patty and really was nothing like bacon or sausage or pork belly, which I kind of thought it would be. Good, but I honestly thought it would be better given the way people talked about it.Goat empanadas - By far the best item we had. These were the most flavorful and really the only item where I thought wow, that's really delicious and like nothing else I've had before. The combination of flavors here is what really wowed me. I didn't really experience that with everything else we had.Service was great and the food was great. Did I feel it was worth the 3 month wait to get reservations at a normal time, probably not so much. But I think good food coupled with a celebrity chef can make people a little crazy in Chicago. So there you have it - another girl and the goat review to add to the thousands already here!"
"It's so pointless to echo all the other five star reviews, but it was wonderful. Everything was consistent and fabulous and crazy good. Â Nothing blew me away, but it all was super delicious, as was the space, the service and the cocktails. Â I can't wait to get back there!"
"We didn't bother to make reservations, so my boyfriend went early at 4:30pm on a Thursday (for my birthday) right when it opened to put our name on the list. Â I came a little later, and we only had to wait maybe half an hour or so to get seated. You really don't have to make reservations here, just make sure to come at 4:30pm or 9pm and you won't have too long of a wait. Â Our waiter was incredibly friendly and nice.We ordered:1) For the bread we got the one with onion butter and herb oil (which I think was basically chimichurri sauce)2) goat carpaccio . tongue-olive vinaigrette . smoked roe - I love carpaccio and we devoured this up...but I couldn't tell a HUGE difference between this and regular beef carpaccio3) sauteed green beans . fish sauce vinaigrette - Delicious; might be our favorite dish that night4) escargot ravioli . bacon . tamarind-miso sauce - Not bad but I think I like escargot by itself instead of in a ravioli5) wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix - Of course we had to try the pig face! It was tender and good but I was starting to get full and everything was pretty oily6) braised beef tongue . masa . beef vinaigrette . salsa verde - Very much what I expected from beef tongue...good sauce, nothing spectacular, but maybe I had gotten so full that I didn't fully appreciate it7) bittersweet chocolate . shiitake gelato . toffee creme fraiche - I LOVED this dessert!!! Even as full as I was, we finished this whole thing. Â The shiitake gelato was unique and delicious.The food was decent, but I think if I had to choose between The Purple Pig and Girl & the Goat, I'd choose The Purple Pig since it's closer to my office and there's less of a wait (not to mention they have delicious bone marrow!). Â Perhaps it was overhyped and we were expecting too much...but we weren't really ""wowed"" by any of the dishes other than the dessert. Â There wasn't anything else that I thought ""this is amazing and I can't get this anywhere else!"" Â We may come back again, but I don't think it'd be worth it if there was a long wait."
"After all the hype, after following Stephanie Izzard on Twitter for months, and reading breathless rave reviews for the cuisine, I had high hopes for Girl and the Goat. Â While some of the dishes were very good, we left ultimately unimpressed and a lot lighter in the wallet.The place is very crowded. Even though we had a reservation, we were asked to wait by the bar until they could get us seated. I ordered two drinks - a beer drink and a glass of wine - and it cost me $25. Holy crap. We finally got seated and our very kind, enthusiastic waitress explained the menu and the specials. We ordered 3 rounds of food - appetizers/bread, seafood, and meat. The first round was their ""Not Campbells"" bread, an order of 4 oysters, and chickpea fritters. The bread was outstanding, as were the dipping sauces. The oysters were tasty, but very, very small and not that meaty. For the price, you can get 6 plump and fresh oysters from The Publican down the street. Anyway. The fritters were outstanding.Our second round of food is what really blew us away the most. Amazing, delicious dishes that had us licking our plates. The seared scallops and the bourbon poached lobster were the two shining stars of the evening. I could not believe how delicious those two dishes were, perfectly sauced, just delicious. This was the apex of our evening, however, as everything following this ranged from ""meh"" to disappointing to say the least.The lamb sausage stuffed calamari was alright, but the sausage lacked any real seasoning. Tasted just kind of like ground cooked lamb. After that we got an order of ham frites, which were exceedingly greasy french fries. Tasty, but the portion was so large for two people and left our fingers literally dripping with ham fat. I'm a fat lover and this was even a little too much for me. The dipping sauces were just more fat; there was no acidity to cut through how heavy those grease vessels were. An order would be good for a table of at least 4.We also got the wood oven roasted pig face, a dish I'd looked forward to the most out of anything. What came out was a greasy, seemingly fried puck of overdone meat, a fried egg, and a few swaths of cloying cilantro and tamarind sauce. The grease, sauces and egg overwhelmed any of the delicate pig face meat. I don't know if this is how this dish is supposed to taste, but I did not like it the way it was presented.We ordered desserts, and those were also just A-OK. The donuts come with a spoon, but are tough and hard to eat without cutting them, and the spoon doesn't exactly do the trick. I had a good-tasting and not overly sweet orange sorbet type of dessert that was good at clearing my palate of the overly heavy meat dishes we'd had before.All that plus a bottle of wine, plus the two drinks before dinner added up to the second most expensive dinner for two I've had in Chicago. I wish the premium that G&TG places on the price of its dishes went into the flavor and experience of eating there. I'd come back for those outstanding seafood dishes for sure, and would like to try other meat dishes to see if maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. But at a place like Girl & The Goat, one would hope that nothing on the menu is ""the wrong thing""."
"I wish yelp had the option of giving half stars, I'd really like to give Girl & the Goat 4.5 stars. Â First of all, Girl & the Goat is extremely popular right now, so you will have to make reservations in advance. Â I really liked the decor and feel of the restaurant. Â It kind of feels like you are in a smoke house. Â Note, you will smell like a smoke house after so keep that in mind! Â I also LOVED that Stephanie Izard was there and it looked like she was checking every dish that went out. Â I got to sample 7 dishes. Â Our server was really friendly, helpful, and enthusiastic. Â She helped us narrow down our list of dishes. Â We started with the goat cheese and corn bread. Â It was very very good. Â The bread is not dense, but not airy either. Â The goat cheese and corn spread was so complimentary to the bread. Â We had woodfire-grilled oysters which was a nice change of pace from raw oysters, but it still held a lot of the raw oyster essence. Â For veggies we had the shishido peppers and cauliflower dishes. Â Both were very savory and satisfying, but the cauliflower was to die for. Â I normally don't like cauliflower that much, but I kept eating it. Â It was the best cauliflower I've ever had. Â We also had the beef tongue dish that was very good. Â We had the sugo with veal and gooseberries. Â This dish was so delicious. Â Finally, we had the softshell crab. Â This was the lowpoint of our meal. Â The dish was way too salty. Â We also had 2 drinks each on top of all our food, so we left extremely full, but extremely satiated! Â I wish we saved some room for dessert!"
"Early last week, I hopped onto opentable.com and on a whim, entered a time for Friday night at this popular new restaurant - thinking there wouldn't be a chance in hell there would be any openings. But much to my surprise, there was one opening at 8:45pm. Voila! The place was packed, as it should be for its second weekend since opening. I walked to the host who took my name and seated my friend and I right when she walked in. There was no wait - and even if there was, I think we would've been fine. I noticed two large communal tables and another section with couches and lower tables for people to order drinks and a few bites before their dinner. We were seated at the end of a long communal booth right next to the chef's tables and the exposed kitchen where we got to watch the master and her cheerful minions at work.Our waiter was excellent! I have never had better service. He start out by saying that he used to work for a wine distributor and knew every bottle on the menu inside so. So we knew we were in good hands. He started us of with a glass of cuvee while we decided on the food we wanted to order so he could suggest the right wine. He split the glass for us, but really, we each had at least a 4 oz pour. The menu is very simple, but every dish sounded so enticing! Everything is broken down to V (Veggies), F (Fish), M (Meat). After we made our selections our waiter knew exactly what we should drink. I did ask that we keep it in the 40 dollar range and he huffed - ""Oh, no one should have to pay more 40 dollars a bottle."" And he brought us a great Spanish red that was priced at $36!Run down on our food:Grilled Shishitos - which are just non-spicy peppers: okay, so this was the one dish recommended by our server. Not our favorite, but there was something nice about the roasted flavor coming from the seeds that saved the dish. Hiramasa Crudo: The pork belly really made this dish. Wow. I could have this every day. Skirt steak: My friend and I kept raving over...wait for it....the fantastic beets and pickles in the dish. They were cooked and seasoned to perfection! I think a guy might think there wasn't enough steak, but I found this was really enjoyable and satisfying.Rabbit Rillette: The crisp crepes were a nice touch to this rich dish.Smoked Goat Pizza: excellent way to end our dinner. We were stuffed!These dishes are meant to share, between the two of us, the 5 were perfect. I have to say - it was one of the best nights out we had in a while. Everything from the service, food, even restaurant-goers felt unpretentious, as many others have mentioned here. A solid night out. My friend and I split the bill down the middle which came to75/person including tax and tip. I am really looking forward to going back - as often as I can!"
"Is Girl and the Goat worthy of the hype. Yep. It is.Although the menu might appeal to adventurous eaters, I guarantee that even a picky eater would enjoy each and every dish (just don't tell them what's in it). Chef Stephanie obviously knows what she is doing (but I guess we already knew that from Top Chef). Â The flavor profiles are both complex and comforting. The sausage stuffed calamari is not to be missed, as well as the cauliflower. The blood orange sorbet dessert should get awards! The many different textures and flavors come together as a perfectly conceived dish. This dish is worthy of Â awards! The food here gets a 5+ but the restaurant is overwhelmingly loud and very cramped. But Stephanie did a fantastic job making a statement. Decorating gets a 5+ also."
"I really wanted to hate this place, because I have such strong feelings against celebrity chefs. Â However, when a girlfriend suggested going to Superbowl brunch, I caved.Thank heaven I did!The food was all amazing. Â The cocktails were amazing. Â The bloody mary came with an entire can of PBR as a back and while I can't rank it among ""favorite bloodies I've ever had,"" it did its job. Â In addition to all of the delicious food, it was an exceptional value. Â I think it was about $40/person including the bloodies.It's been a while since I went, so I can't recall every detail, but if you're like me (with a celebrity chef vendetta), swallow your pride. Â And get the chickpea fritters."
"This place is overly hyped. It's supposed to be aamaaaaazing, but think logically about it when you're actually there.SALT. SALT. SALT. SALT. SALT. That's all I can say about this place. Everything, no joke, EVERYTHING was overly salted. Pork belly, green beans, I felt like I was on my grandparents farm having a go with the salt licks they leave out for deer. Salty.I've been here twice, once was when they first opened and my friend and I happened in for drinks. The mixologists make some good ones, nothing to write home about but still good nonetheless. The second experience was my girlfriends and I went for a girls dinner. It could have been my friends as they are not the most ""adventurous"" eaters but overall the actual meal was not worth the hype.The only thing worth mentioning was the chocolate cake with shiitake ice cream. Fabulous flavor mix between the bitterness of the chocolate and the earth flavor of the shiitake ice cream. That my friends is the redeeming factor and why this place gets 2 stars."
"A friend of mine from high school was visiting her uncle in Chicago, and so we went out for dinner. Being in the restaurant scene himself, her uncle chose Girl and the Goat, which I had been wanting to try since I had gotten some sort of Thrillist/Tasting Table type email about it weeks ago. It's a great place to go with a group of people so that you can try a whole bunch of different dishes. We were stuffed at the end, and the bill wasn't TOO bad. To recap, I had:some sort of corn bread to start pan fried shishito peppers . parmesan . sesame . misosauteed green beans . fish sauce vinaigretteroasted cauliflower . pickled peppers . pine nuts . mintgrilled baby octopus . guanciale . lemon-pistachio vinaigrettecrisp soft shell crab . sweet corn . lime . chili aiolirabbit rilette. crisp rice crepe. ginger giardinare. sweet garlicgrilled lamb ribs . sweet onion bbq . grilled avocado . pistachio picadagoat cheese bavarois with blueberries and granolaYou can see which ones I pulled off of the website menu and which I pulled from memory =]My favorites were the lamb ribs, softshell crab, and the bavarois. YUM! The best part of this meal was the sheer variety of things I had to eat. We had to sit in the lounge area because the place was packed, so come early or reserve your spot early.We also got to take a picture with Stephanie. Made my night =]"
"I don't consider myself a true foodie, but I loved the food. I didn't know what all of the ingredients were, but they tasted amazing together. I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate of the Halibut dish, but refrained from doing so in public! I had the chickpea fritters, the salmon tar tare, the halibut and the goat chorizo flat bread (my favorite). I dined there on a Friday night at 11:30pm and ended up eating in the lounge area b/c even at that time, there weren't any tables open. It was a great though and the staff is very helpful at explaining the dishes. Great atmosphere too, not pretentious at all. Loved it!"
"Our Girl & the Goat (summer edition) visit was even better than our first. Â First off, I think the portion sizes have gotten slightly smaller, which is a GREAT thing. Â You can try more dishes without being uncomfortably stufffed. Â Well, either the portion sizes have gotten smaller or our stomachs have expanded since we last came here. Â I prefer to believe the former.Anyhow, G&TG is even better than I remembered it to be. Â We started off with the fried squash blossoms stuffed with crab - perfectly deep fried. Â The Mr. Potato bread was warm & soft and the leek butter was SO delicious. Â The combination was like potato leek soup in food form. Â The shishito peppers with parmesan, sesame, & miso was one of our favorites from our last visit and we were so happy to see it on the menu again. Â Perfection.The goat belly confit with fennel and poached lobster & crab. Â My gosh. Â The BF astutely said that the lobster & crab alone tasted like angel food cake because of all the butter they used to poach it in. Â It didn't matter. Â Together, everything was the perfect blend of savory & sweet.The skewered lamb heart & fried sweetbreads with fresh strawberries was my favorite. Â Beautiful combination of flavors! Â It was reminiscent of a trotters, foie gras, & strawberry dish we got at Incanto in San Francisco but that's neither here nor there... Soft shell crab with strawberries and slaw was also beautifully done.The goat chorizo flatbread with fresh goat cheese was heavenly. Â Can I please get a goat chorizo burrito please?Finally, we ended with pork-fat doughnuts with blackberries & malted vanilla gelato.Okay one, two, three, four...dear lord, we ate EIGHT dishes between the 2 of us??!! Â Judge us if you will but we know good food when we taste it!"
"Simply awesome.I went with a group of 5 on a Thursday night, and we waited for about an hour and a half just for a seat in the bar. I was worried it wouldn't be worth it...but it was totally worth it.If you're ok with sitting in the bar, it's first come first serve, and it's very pleasant - low tables and couches, and the full menu is served in the bar. The service was fantastic - friendly, fast, informative. The meal really...everything was so great it's hard to even think of favorites. BUT, favorites were the escargot ravioli with miso sauce, the lamb heart with strawberry (I never would have imagined this combination would work but it was amazing). But you must must get desert. The bittersweet chocolate with shittake mushroom gelato. I do not generally care for mushrooms, and I am by no means a chocoholic, but that desert is indescribably good."
"I made a reservation 5 months ago for a table for two at a normal dinner time. Â Perhaps my expectations were so high that I found my experience to be less than great. Â The food was, of course, delicious and interesting; however, it is not something you cannot live without.The atmosphere was hip, trendy, and posh - a very happening place if you are looking for fun. Â It has dim lighting and is pretty loud. Â Overall, good, but not mind-blowing.If you have not been there, do it. Â It is worth going. Â Definitely 4.5 stars!"
"Finally came around to trying this ""Top Chef"" winner restaurant. Great service, original menu (though very heavy & overseasoned), and warm atmosphere. It's worth checking out. Be warned, this place is hard to get into, reservations typically is about a month or two out. Our waitress was very friendly and helpful, very willing to spend time with us and make some suggestions. As others mentioned in the review, our water glasses were rarely half full, we like this attentive service. Here's what we ordered:1) Seared scallops with bed of smoked goat, spiced canteloupe, and coconut-cucumber salad - very flavorful. Huge scallops, very fresh, but overseasoned. The spiced canteloupe was very unique and tasty.2) Sockeye salmon tartare with summer squash, summer truffles, and marcona alamonds - outstanding. The ingredients just work together well, very smooth entry.3) Grilled baby octopus with guanciale, beans, radish, and pistachio-lemon vinaigrette - not bad, but some of the beans were uncooked? It's not bad, but we thought the lemon vinaigrette was a bit too overpowering.4) Seared tuna with lamb sausage, grilled blueberry, and pepitas - very interesting combo and it works. There are multiple layers of flavors with this combination.5) Kalbi style beef ribs, corn coblettes and charred okra - very kalbi...very kalbi.~$130 for two people, with 2 glasses of wine & tips included. We skipped dessert because none of the 4 choices caught our eyes."
Great stuff. I suggest that you order things you're scared of. You will be happy and satisfied.
Amazing. So many delicious options.
"What I really liked: Octopus. The space.What I won't get next time: Chicken Little, Pig Face, Beet Salad, Calamari, Bavarois. A server who does something with our last in line dish such that it takes 20 minutes after the previous dish, but then comes out and flat out blames the kitchen for the mistake. Might the kitchen disagree? I am an instigator.What I recommend: Anyone who likes this place will love (equally, if not more, The Drawing Room). End plug.I also don't really understand why everyone talks about reservations and booked tables. I walked through the doors on a weekday (don't recall which) between 5:30-6:00, said or just gestured 2 with my fingers, maybe said no to having reservations, and walked right over to a table. Seemed like it happened without my even having to stop for a second. So for ""foodie"" conformist dying to eat here for any reason... do what I did?"
"I pulled some magic and got a reservation last minute. Â The service was fantastic, the place is nice and lively. Â It's pricey... when you add up all the ""tapas"" they offer. Â This is 100% a place for foodies that are interested in trying crazy combo's.... that's not me. Â Although the service was great, I think the staff needs to take into consideration that the average person eating there might not have the stomach for some of the chef's creations. Â They may indeed be fantastic but if you are not adventurous then just stick to what seems good for you!Oh, and try a couple of their great mixed drinks :)"
"If you're a top chef fan then you probably have been waiting to eat at this place since it opened in Chicago. Â I ate at the sister restaurant little goat last year and loved it. Â Tonight I finally met ""big sister"" and she was just as wonderful in similar but different ways. Â The overall ambiance of the restaurant was very modern. Â You can tell who their target audience is as soon as you walk in the place. Â (Tupac was playing at full blast no joke) Â I am part of that younger crowd so I loved the atmosphere, but I could do with closer tables; especially if you are going to have the music that loud. Â  That way you might be able to hear your guest without straining your neck from leaning forward the whole time. Â But I digress. Â The service was outstanding 5 stars across the board. Â I found it funny when the hostess sat us; they both said together have a good dinner, and then without even looking at each other with a monotone voice in unison said ""jinx"". Â I don't know why but I found that funny. Â Our waitress was very polite, timely, and had a genuine passion in her job. Â The food was 4 stars. Â The goat empanadas and the zucchini bread was definitely the best thing my girlfriend and I ordered. Â The roasted cauliflower on the other hand was saltier then that Atlantic Ocean. Â Five hours later typing this I can still feel the salt in my lips! Â Overall I would come back to this place again very soon. Â If you like modern, different, ""American"" food then this is the place for you. Â I have seen the HYPE on yelp before I came to eat here, and I still had a fabulous dinner. Â I really think you should disregard some of the negative posts I have read because to me the place lived up to the HYPE. Â (just my opinion)"
"oh my GOODness. what can i say that hasn't already been said? i've been wanting to go to girl and the goat for a while...and finally saw a 5pm rez on a saturday on open table. snapped it up without hesitation. early bird special, here we come.first impression...we loved all of the dark wood and the comfy chairs- combined with the amazing service, we felt welcome right away. we had:-assortment of oysters (we tried one of each..bf's fave was the fried oyster, mine was the phanton creek w/the horseradish aioli)- a bread that was the special of the day-pig face (i loved this, but it was a little sweet for the bf)-pork belly (a tasty, solid choice) -lamb sausage stuffed calamari (our absolute favorite. o.m.g.)-blood orange sorbet (at the recommendation of our server...such a great suggestion. pistachio cake and creamy blood oranges...yes please)stephanie was there and we were polite and thanked her quickly for our fabulous meal (i had to stop myself from having a fangirl meltdown)and in the end, our experience was simply wonderful from start to finish."
"Came here a few weeks ago when I was visiting my college roommate in Chicago. Even at 10pm, the restaurant was crackin' and was brimming with attractive people in their 20's and early 30's. Our party of four shared (in order of recommendations): *Sugo - I think I died and went to heaven when I had this. I'm an avid fan of freshly made pasta that feature a few key ingredients. The veal, pork and goat bolognese was so savory and perfectly seasoned. The gooseberries were an exotic touch. They taste like a hybrid of kiwis and mangoes. Everything was perfect about this pasta dish. This is one of the top 3 best pastas I've ever had. *Ham frites - Beware: these are addicting. The dry shredded ham dusted on the thin cut and extra fried fries is finger-licking good! Tastes great with the Thousand Island dipping sauce from the pretzel bread side. *Grilled baby octopus - This was one of the few dishes we tried that wasn't heavily coated in sauce or cream and as such, was a nice contrast. However, the number of ingredients was incredibly overwhelming. *Crisp calamari w/ rabbit ravioli - The ravioli was my favorite part of the dish. They were so delicate and the rabbit was not gamey at all. *Seared scallops w/ goat and shitakes - Delicious and individually loved every element of this dish. However, all of the multiple ingredients combined was also overwhelming. *Pretzel bread w/ swiss mustard butter & thousand island - LOVED the soft, fluffy warm bread and the bits of chopped egg white in the thousand island spread. I couldn't stop using the Thousand Island on everything. *Pig face - I was so full at this point I did not get to really enjoy this dish. From the one bite I had, I recall that the meat was very tender and well seasoned. I was not a fan of the tamarind sauce, and our egg was way overcooked and not ""sunny-side"" up as promised. *Pan-fried shishito peppers - Didn't like the strong green bellpepper taste and creamy sauce. If you're looking for a vegetable dish to help lighten up your meal, this is not the one to order. Our total pre-tip bill was $135 including 4 beers, and we were all completely full and satisfied. I will definitely eat here next time I'm in town!"
"It's still a good place to bring out-of-towners, but otherwise, not my favorite."
"I made a reservation to Girl and the Goat for July 25 at 6:45pm in May! Â I was not that hungry, but there was no way I was not going to go. Â We arrived at 6:50 (a little late) and it was completely packed and we did not get seated until about 7:10 because our table was finishing up.We ordered the seared scallops, seared tuna, pig face, goat belly, and roasted cauliflower (which was complimentary). Â I would definitely go back for the goat belly! Loved it but I am a big fatty meat eater kind of girl. Â The pig face was good but nothing too special to me. Â It might have tasted better if I was actually hungry. Â I loved the scallops and seared tuna. Â It might be small for others but it was perfect for me and my boo.Overall we both liked it a lot. Â Everything cost about $90 which I was expecting and I thought it was worth it. Â Oh yeah the service there is EXCELLENT : )"
"After all my visible and audible excitement for finally going to Goat and the Girl, I found myself feeling nervous that this was all hype and the food may not live up to my expectations, especially since it's an expensive-special-occasion place. Â Nope not hype! The food is amazing and so is the service. Â I'm not sure if there is anything bad on the menu. Â We ate:Green Beans - So good! The flavors are amazing. Â I know it's only green beans, but its not really ""only"" green beans. Â When the waiter asked what we were thinking, we literally had only meat dishes in mind. Â He suggested we add a veggie and said the green beans would be good. Â And it was - my boyfriend loved it!Sugo (pasta with goat, beef, and pork) - we wanted to lick the bowl clean and we almost ordered another one.Pig Face - yep that was good. Â But next time I'm there I'll try another pork dish for variety. Onion Brioche - I'm still dreaming of these buttery dense clouds. Â A Goat dish with bits of lobster in it - I really liked the taste of the goat, it was a more subtle dish. Â It was good, but I'll want to try another goat dish as well.Cowboy oysters - Â This is the only thing I wouldn't get again Â but only because I like oysters cold, but they tasted good. Â Beef Short Rib - oh the meat is so good. Â Chocolate toffee shitake cake with gelato -it was good, but I'll definitely try other desserts because they all looked delicious also. Â Like I said, I'm not sure if you can go wrong at this restaurant. We ate there on March 4 and since then I've been on their website at least 3 times just to look at their menu. Â I did read some of the bad reviews before going and in defense of Girl and The Goat, if you are looking to just gorge yourself (which is perfectly ok, because sometimes you just want to stuff your face) but this isn't the place to do that. Â It's not all you can eat pasta from the Olive Garden for $9.99."
Party of 4 loved it! Â Frites and pig face were great; really everything was perfect. Â Smaller portions so work with your server. Â Excellent drinks. Â Loved the Girl and the Goat painting. Â Plan months ahead for prime reservation times.
"Cute restaurant, nice servers and service but sadly, a bit underwhelming when it came to the food. I was delighted to find out that at the helm was the Season 4 Top Chef winner but when it came right down to it, the food was just okay. The salmon tartare was the best dish of the evening and it was light, refreshing and well composed. However, many of the other dishes we ordered were over salted and heart-stoppingly rich. I actually had to stop eating the green beans on my plate because I could feel myself struggling for breath under the weight of the cream. I normally indulge in rich foods, and while I consider butter a good friend of mine, this was simply too much.Many of the dishes sounded interesting and while the concept was good and the flavor pairings were unique, on the plate and palette they just didn't come together completely. In design, we have a saying that the formula for greatness is, 1+1=3, where the whole is something greater than the sum of its parts. Sadly, this was a case where in fact the whole was just a bunch of its parts and no more. To give credit, the parts were good, but the final result lacked that final thing that makes you go ""damn this is amazing!""Overall, I'm glad I tried it out but I won't be back until I try more of what Chicago has to offer."
"Quite an awesome place this is! It's lovely when a restaurant takes care of every little detail. From the plating sizes that were just right for the size of the table, to the napkins that actually obsorbed stuff, to incrediblly quick and attentive servi ce, every small detail is well thought out. We started off with an amazing bread and butter appetizer with the softest and most dense bread we've ever had. Since the bread came with mushroom soup butter, they were also nice to add some regular butter on the side for my husband, who is allergic to mushrooms. The chickpea appetizer was just about ok. It was the main course that really blew it out of the park. I have never kept brussel sprouts aside to have as my last bite of the dish. Ever! The sprouts are unbelievably tasty. The pan roasted whitefish came with a gorgeous crust and an out-of-the-ballpark-I-can't-believe-how-tasty-Â­this-is kinda goat chowder. We ended our meal with a parsnip cheesecake that was all sorts of good! A special mention to how unintrusive and attentive they were in clearing the dishes up and providing us with clean plates after each course, without making it seem like they were 'monitoring' us. I think that kind of service would alone warrant a 5-star rating. It's those things that set a restuarant apart and this one is a gem!"
"I love Top Chef. Â I watch each season religiously, and not just because I'm in love with Padma Lakshmi. Â Despite that love, I haven't run out to Sprout just yet and I wouldn't like a restaurant just because a Top Chef was the proprietor.Girl and the Goat is special. Â Beyond the food, it's a perfectly designed space. Â It's a really enjoyable place to eat and drink. Â For a restaurant that has its own wine, it has a pretty decent beer selection. Â Like all special restaurants, though, the food is the star. Â We started with bread and anchovy butter. Â As I said at the time, I wish all butter was anchovy butter. Â The wood-fire oven warmed oysters were outstanding. Â For the more entree-like items, we had the octopus (outstanding), the pig face (terrific), and the calamari (not so great). Â I was actually shocked to not enjoy the calamari as everything else was so great. Â It's a good idea, in general, grilled calamari stuffed with ground lamb, but the lamb lacked flavor. Â Was it terrible? Â No, not at all, but for a restaurant of this quality, it was lacking. Â The pig and octopus more than made up for it, though. Â I'm a sucker for small plates and even more a sucker for small plates that are amazing. Â Girl and the Goat is both."
"Please tell me what I am missing!!! Â I waited forever to get into this place and I finally had a chance tonight. Â Maybe I need to go back but I have to say I was totally underwhelmed. Â The restaurant is beautiful but the smell of smoke is just too much. Â We both stunk when we walked out of there. Â Maybe they need to do something about their ventilation??? Â The beet salad was good, the chickpea fritters were good, the bread with the Parmesan butter and maple oil was okay but the scallops were just fair. Â I have definitely had better. Â I love Stephanie Izard and I loved her old restaurant Scylla. Â I think the hype might have gotten to me. Â Oh well...there are enough people who love Girl and the Goat. Â I don't have to worry about it going anywhere anytime soon."
"While I think Stephanie Izzard is a fabulous chef - I probably won't hurry back. Â A few things were amazing - mainly the pig face (which I may dream about). Â Everything else was really good - and the goat tenderloin was surprisingly tasty- but not quite worth the hype. Â The shrimp and octopus were just good - not amazing. Â I wasn't a fan of the desserts. Â  Â We had 4 people - and split the bill and it was $80 per person... and we didn't have a ton left over. Â The service was fabulous..... really, I thought she was amazing! Â Overall - I will probably choose Avec over Girl and the Goat. Â Easier to get in - and I liked more of what they were serving...."
Food was delicious! We sat at the bar and had a great time but Veronica put a damper on our night when she questioned our tip. She was abrupt all night but Matt was great!
"I had been meaning to try Girl and the Goat for some time, as I've heard excellent reviews.A friend and I dined there last night. It was a belated gift for my birthday. The spot was busy, but the hostess was still able to put us down on a waitlist (so helpful!!). About a 45 minute wait later, we were sat at a table overlooking the kitchen. We were so happy, it was the table we were hoping for!Our waiter was Tony. He was enthusiastic, accommodating, helpful, and, of course, so friendly! He sampled us a wide assortment of dishes on the menu ranging from pork face, to seared tuna, from escargot ravioli, to grilled cauliflower. All were exceptionally delicious. The seared tuna was a tasty winner, with the escargot ravioli a standout amongst the meal (original, yummy, and striking). The grilled octopus was also yummy, with a great texture - not something easily attained with that fare. We also tried their oyster menu, which is a great starter to the meal. Light, fun, and playfully tasty.My friend and I had the pleasure of discussing the restaurant with Jordan and Ada, who were working across from us in the kitchen. They were so friendly, and of course very knowledgeable about the menu, dishes, and the spot.The pastry chef Alana was amazing! We sampled two of her desserts, the pork fat donuts and the 'cheesecake' - both so wonderful and tasty.Overall, an amazing experience with great staff, great food, and great cuisine. SO impressed, and highly recommended!"
"As if this place needs another stellar review to convince you of just how good it is...I have thought better of it so as not to overload the place with even more patrons clamoring for a table. What a nightmare that was (first come first serve at the bar is more like piranha swirling around their prey), but kill or be killed, good things to come to those who wait, come hell or high water...whichever cliche you prefer, it was worth it. The nondescript curb appeal does not prepare you for the sexy yet comforting atmosphere of the restaurant. The open kitchen bustling and keeping the diners connected to the food before they even take their first bite. The wine list is great and has many by the glass selections (yay). Now, the most important part- the food. Three letters for you: Y-U-M. Everything being local and artfully prepared aside, the combination of the ingredients in every dish just work. The portions are not overwhelming and satiate your desire for the dish just right. We started with the chickpea fritters and roasted cauliflower. From there we had the escargot ravioli and grilled octopus salad (whoa). The finale was the pig face. Sounds atrocious, but was simply divine. It was as delicate as a dish like that can be and had tons of flavor. I am a huge fan and suggest you dont turn a blind eye to this dish based on the name. I am not a dessert fan, but wow...the dessert was absolutely melt in your mouth delicious. The rhubarb and lemon shortcake was something very illegal in a little mason jar. The donuts were nothing to write home about, but good nonetheless.It is really too bad that NYC does not have this restaurant."
"Made reservations for my birthday, Wednesday, May 18th, many moons ago. Â Oops. Â Bulls playoff game is the same night. Â Oh well...Love the small plates! Â Left feeling full yet not sickenly stuffed. Â We had the Stingray Oysters:the crunch was surprising, delicate oyster flavor, yum-o, Chickpeas, Scallops, Soft Shell Crab, Halibut, Goat Belly, Beef Tongue and my fiance for some reason wanted bread. Â It was for the lobster butter.Leaning dangerously towards zero meat I was pleased with the selection of vegetarian dishes. Â My very carnivorous partner surprisingly deemed the chickpea dish as his favorite. Â What?! Â His favorite beef tongue and scallops did not get the nod?!The place was jumping for a Wednesday night and we had a short wait by the bar before we were seated. Â Lots of large groups and couples and the dress ran from casual in Cons to 3 piece suit suits. Â Our waitress was friendly and knowledgable and even pointed out the general manager so we knew who to talk to next time we walked in sans reservation. Only negative was that my seat was literally on top of two different cushions on the bench. Â Lucky for them their food was great. ;)"
"Are any of you guys out there music fans? You remember when Radiohead released ""In Rainbows"" for free, and there was all that hype? Remember how you thought there was no way it could have been good enough to live up to it, but then it met and exceeded your expectations? Well, the Girl and the Goat is that in restaurant form. I give you license to believe everything you hear about it.We started with cocktails; all the ones we sampled are good, but the Smoking Jacket (a sort of Old Fashioned made with Old Forrester Bourbon and a whiff of tobacco smoke) is the clear winner, in terms of sheer innovation. The food is delectably hedonistic; we ate so many amazing dishes, so I'm only going to hit the high points. The goat carpaccio with green olives, capers, and watercress is surprisingly light and refreshing, and has a flavor profile which feels familiar and distinctive all at the same time. While I am usually miffed when a place charges for bread, the one we sampled (made with beet flour and pork fat, and served with candied walnuts and goat cheese butter) definitely makes one forget this minor nuisance. Mussels are impossibly large and meaty, and are served in a piquant herb broth with goat sausage croutons (how the hell does one get goat sausage in a crouton? Seriously. Whatever, it's delicious). Seared pork cheek, topped with a fried egg and served with tamarind sauce, is (according to one of my dining partners) a playful take on a Filipino specialty; whatever its etiology, it's a very impressive dish. Escargot ravioli with bacon and octopus with guanciale, wax beans, and pistachio vinaigrette are both fantastic takes on classic cephalopod creations, thoroughly varied in texture and flavor. Desserts were all spectacular; in my humble opinion, the star was the impossibly dark chocolate cake, flavored with thai chili and served with peanut ice cream and pomegranates.This is food I don't think you can eat anywhere else, so I could swallow the large bill; by no means exorbitant for the quality and quantity that we ate, but something you should psychologically ready yourself for. All in all, I'm confident in saying this was one of the best meals I have had the privilege to enjoy in my life. Habitually, I end my reviews with an assessment of whether or not I will come back. To be honest, this was so good that I don't want to return and risk tarnishing my memory of this meal. Regardless, it's an absolute must-try"
"Definitely one of my favorite places in Chicago! Â The food was delicious, unique, and flavorful. Â I have been twice, and my favorite is still the pappardelle. Â The green beans are also amazing. Â Between my two visits, I have ordered the soft shell crab, pig face, sautÃ©ed shrimp, beef tongue, homemade bread, raw oysters, and the goat pizza, and I have been happy and excited about each choice. Â Also, for an amazing dining experience - request to sit at the chef's table. Â You are able to watch the line chefs make and prepare all the food. Â They chefs explain the dishes to you, make jokes, and just add to the overall atmosphere of the restaurant. Â We saw the executive chef and owner, Stephanie Izard checking each dish before it went out, and then she came over to introduce herself! Â As a hardcore Top Chef fan, I was star struck. Â I highly recommend this restaurant to any Chicago resident or visitor!!"
"TOO LOUD and CROWDED! and seating is tight. Â They sat us on the other side of the bar where people leaned into our space and it was hard to have a conversation.Drinks were greatThe roasted beets salad was delicious.The fried oysters over egg salad were perfectionScallops were good, cooked perfectly but too much going on with them (pomegranate, pumpkin, nuts, brussel sprouts) for 2 scallopsmussels delicious and frits were greatI loved the food, but I could have done without people hovering over us while sitting for dinner and not being able to talk or hear each other."
"My new favorite restaurant.My boyfriend and I made a reservation a month and a half ago, but accidentally made it the night of their James Beard dinner. Â They called us the next day and apologized and re-reserved us for the following evening. Â We got there, and were seated at the chef's table which was an amazing experience.The waiters/chefs were so friendly, and the food was even better. Â My favorites were the chickpea fritters, scallops, seppia and apple bread. Â I'll be back, most definitely."
"Ate here alone on a work jaunt at the recommendation of others (and Top Chef!). The bread offering is very interesting, a pick of breads with accompanying compound butter and a sweet chutney or compote. I chose the liver butter with the marquat marmelade (since I'm a huge fan of terrines and pates). What I didn't realise is that I would be presented with a freshly baked, still hot, individual loaf (tiny) to enjoy with the fatty, rich liver butter and sweet, acidic marmelade. Fantastic.The menu, is broken into V(eg) F(ish) and M(eat), so I ordered one of each. V - chickpea fritters with romesco sauce, cottage cheese and accompanied by deep fried, crispy chickpeas tossed in parprika or turmeric or cayenne or something, and also interesting blanched fresh green chickpeas. Oustanding.F- Sea scallops, chopped white shrimp, seared scallops, goat sausage . white shrimp . shiitakes . winter squash. One scallop was huge and one small - but delicious. M - braised beef tongue. First try of this organ. Very tender and delicate texture, almost like ""monkfish of a cow"", and then served with masa chips (more soggy than crispy) and a lively, bright salsa verde. This was delicious and outstanding. WIne: I started with a glass of the G&G semillon-viognier, what a delicious wine, and then moved through an offering of the wilamette valley pinot noir. Great wines! I love the quartino thing in Chicago - so you get more than a glass.Atmos is modern, vibrant and fun. My waiter was a champ too - saw the next night at Avec (read my review there :)"
"I have a confession. I'm addicted to smoking.No, not tobacco, but the deliciousness of food in any proximity of smokey smells. As I walked into the Girl and the Goat on Wednesday evening, my senses were overcome by the powerful smell of smokiness.My friend and I had a 6:30 reservation. We arrived at 6:25 and thought we'd be seated promptly (the whole purpose of a reservation?) no such luck. We were left waiting in the seating lounge area for quite some time.I had a glass of the Artazu Artazuri Garnacha 2007 Grenache Wine, since grenache is the new trending wine variety. The mark up on wine prices in restaurants always surprise me. Not a good thing or bad thing, but.. surprised since a bottle of Artazu retails for about $13...The food was ok. The waitstaff was incredibly nice once we were seated, and was helpful in offering to help us decipher what was on the menu. I ordered the fat back and the crisp skate, as well as the bread with sweet onion butter.The fat back wasn't all it was made to sound. The waiter(s) kept saying how awesome it was but.. eh.. disappointed. The biscuits weren't warm at all, and had a bit of a stale texture. The pickled sweet onions were the best part of the dish. I was expecting more flavor from the fat back but... it tasted like just fat, and unappetizing. I think the concept of the plate was great but it didn't really execute well.The crisp skate was great. No complaints here! There was such great harmony on the plate between each ingredient.The bread and butter. My friend and I were excitedly talking, catching up on one thing and another when she suddenly pulled from her mouth.... a quarter sized hunk of plastic. Kinda surprised since this is an upscale place, with such high expectations?Either way, the waitress and manager were quick to come and apologize, which is always appreciated. I can't say enough about how important this is, and how under utilized a simple apology is. Our bill was partially comped, but we made sure to tip on the full bill, as our waitress had been so helpful.It was a great experience, but I think our expectations were placed too high from everything we had read and seen. I don't think I'll be rushing to make my next reservation."
"Bread was warm and fresh, and accompanied by delicious spreads. Duck Leg confit is a must. Dessert was well balanced. If you are on your own or with one other person, strongly consider the bar seating which will ensure minimal wait times and service by the terrific bartenders."
"Going in, my expectations weren't too high, knowing all the hipe that comes from a restaurant that just opened. Well, was I wrong!!! It was some of the best food I have tasted... Such small menu, yet so many flavors. They were running Â late with our table, but we had no problem with that, enjoying BEST of Three cocktails at the bar. After we sat down, the hostess was very apologetic and our wonderful server Marnie sent us a few appetizers on the house!! Without us asking or complaining about the wait. Marnie was extremely knowledgeable (my friend mentioned her lactose intolerance and she took great care of her), personable and friendly. The food-I have no words to describe how good it was---just go eat there and you'll not regret (green beans, pigface, lamb stuff calamari were some of my favorites, oh and the breads with butter were outstanding!!)We will definitely be back for more."
"Has any restaurant shot up to more than 400 reviews in a shorter period of time?I'll add one more to the list. LOVED this restaurant. Went on a snowy Sunday for dinner with one other couple and ordered almost half the menu. The things that blew me away were unexpected: the calamari stuffed with lamb and the butternut squash ravioli ARE MUSTS. They were so good, I put my face and my hands and sobbed a little bit. I was a little disappointed in the pig face and the beef tongue. I was really looking forward to them and had high expectations. That's probably why I was let down a little, but they were still yummy.Other memorable dishes include the bread-- gluten free bread for my husband-- including delicious maple butter and sweet potato spread. Ham frites and the shrimp were also amazing. This restaurant is not to be missed for the adventurous eater, or the diner who just likes damn good food."
"To really review this place I would have had to take notes, which I did not. There are several things on the menu I have never seen at any restaurant, and each new plate you've never heard of turns out to be delicious. On the down side I still stink of smoke, and my eyes were a little burned from the smokey hardwood fire that was fueling some of the dishes. The Â whole neighborhood has kind of taken on that scent. It's an effective ""other restaurant repellent"". Â With a small plate format it's tough to describe any dish without doing an injustice to another. Generally I'd steer clear of the olives in favor of ordering more salads and breads. The olives were awesome, but at a place like this they are unnecessary. The salads were hands down the best I have ever had, and I'm guessing that the artisanal breads were baked on site. Don't be afraid to try new things here, they know what they're doing.Can't forget the service. Not sure if we just got lucky, but our guy was smart, effective and funny. The atmosphere, aside from being a little too smokey, was amazing. Very cool space, lots of beautiful people to watch, and a never ending stream of people coming in to claim the reservation they made two months ago. Good to see Randolph buzzing again with this current world-class establishment. Also, at the end of the day, it is a great value."
"Really nice, Interieur and Food. Would like to come again. Can recommend these dishes: Best-of-Three $13, Double Barrell $13. Cocktails (Mojito and Octopus) $13 each. Its not downtown, but not too far. Reservations recommended always long time in advance !"
"I went here on a Wednesday night and it was packed. It was my first time at this restaurant so I thought this place must be good. However, I was disappointed. Though our waitress was super friendly and nice, but all of the dishes were really salty."
"Definitely need a reservation here. Very packed, even at 10pm on a Thursday! But Â despite that I absolutely loved it! The food is incredible! Get the scallops!!!"
"My wife and I went here for our anniversary with high expectations and had an awesome time. I love that not only did they have a wood burning oven but the grill station used wood too. You don't see that a lot. All small plates. I think the most expensive thing was $17. Most were around $11. We shared 6 things plus dessert and were surprised how little we spent, even with a few cocktails. We got out under$140. I see plenty of reviews of othr restaurants that complain about price and portion size. If I get out under $100 a head and need a wheelchair because I'm so full and buzzed, well folks, that's a damn fine value!The food was really good. We tried things we don't ever see like the whipped back fat, friggin awesome! The soft shell crab was great too. We both really loved the chickpea fritters and the bread. Scallops were cooked perfectly. I like to get scallops as a test.Was it perfect? Well is any place perfect? I mean to be totally honest I thought the fries with the dehydrated ham as a bit salty, but so what?!Desserts were pretty damn cool, and that's what I do for a living. The potato fritters with candied eggplant and mission figs was really cool. No weak links from the pastry chef at all! Well done.Service was great. Tony was really attentive, never overbearing. Water always full, empty plates gone. If you go here bring the kitchen some beer! I did and they earned it! Wish I could give 4.5 stars.One last thing. You WILL leave smelling like a house fire, which I personally love but if you're uptight about your drycleaning, don't wear the Italian silk."
"My expectations for Girl and the Goat were so high that I was afraid it couldn't possibly live up to them! Â Luckily it was just as amazing as I expected!First of all, they were able to squeeze us in with a very last-minute reservation. Â Major bonus points for that. Â The restaurant is a lot bigger than I was expecting, but the ambience was great. Â We were quickly greeted by our waitress, who walked us through the menu. Â She was very informative without being condescending. Â Then the food, WOW. Â We started with one of the housemade breads: totally delicious and accompanied by both a carrot oil and a raisin walnut butter. Â Then we had the sugo (basically a stew with mixed meats): I'm not normally a stew person, but it was amazing. Â We also tried scallops with braised veal and marcona almond butter (yum), lamb ribs (yum), and a chickpea fritter on heirloom tomato and mozarella salad (double yum). Â Everything was perfectly cooked and the flavors were different, but still approachable. Â The beer and wine list were also extensive and had several affordable options.We topped off our meal with a potato dumpling, fig, and candied eggplant dessert. Â It was good, but not nearly as good as the rest of the food. Â I say skip dessert and eat more for dinner! Â All in all, we had an amazing experience and only spent about $115 for 2 people (including drinks, tax, and tip)."
"Stephanie Izard, you are a genius!! Â I didn't think I could like you any more after being such a top chef fanatic, but in fact, it is possible!Girl and the Goat is my new favorite restaurant, SERIOUSLY! Â We went the third night it was open - it was packed, lively, fun, friendly, and delicious. Â The concept is to use the whole animal, and small plates served to share with the table. Â Now looking online at the dishes, I was a little weary that I may leave hungry. Â I'm more of a ""normal food"" person than ""exotic food"" person. Â I just want normal foods that I know and like done really really well. Â Thankfully for me, my fiance is willing to try anything. Â We were constantly impressed with everything we ordered.Kristina, our server, was so on top of the ball. Â She was extremely knowledgeable, told us the story of the restaurant, walked us through ordering, and most importantly found us the perfect New Zealand Pinot Noir! Â We placed our whole order, and then Stephanie decides how to send them out to the table based on what would taste good together. Â It was perfectly plated.Our Order:Bread - sourdough style with whole garlic olive oil and anchovy butterChilled Onion Soup - the perfect texture, sweet, summery flavorHam Frites - The fries were perfectly crunchy, salted, and served with a delicious smoked swiss and roasted tomato aoli dipping saucesSoft Crab - Served in whole, flash fried, served with an amazing yellow corn and sauteed with cilantro lime vinaigretteGoat Pizza - Soft crust thin pizza topped with pulled smoked goat, ricotta, kale, and dark cherries. Â YUMYou will leave here stuffed and impressed. Â I dare you to try and not love it!! Â We have our next reservation August 2nd and I am already dreaming about it!"
"Amazing! Â Every dish we tasted was great. Server was smart and funny and knew what he was talking about, he also let us know he was south side Greek, so he had in depth goat knowledge. Â Dessert was good, I would love to have seen something with Chocolate, maybe next time. Â Again really a decadent and pleasureful dining experience, it definitely seems like the start of something special!"
"Overview: Best meal ever! Â Ate dinner right next to RAHM EMMANUELl! Â Soooo awesome.Food: We ordered one each of the oysters - normally, I'm not a fan of cooked oysters, but theirs were delicious! Â Somehow, they managed to flavor them without losing the natural flavor of the oyster. Â We also had the squash ravioli, lamb stuff calamari (sounds like a weird combo, but surprisingly well paired), and pork shoulder (melted right off the bone!) ... everything was perfectly cooked and prepared. Â  Ambiance: Â This place is super busy - you have to make reservations a couple months in advance, although I saw one of my friends there that night and he was lucky enough to have walked in and gotten a table. Â Even with our reservations, we had to wait 30+ minutes before we were sat down ... but it was SO WORTH IT, since we sat next to Rahm Emmanuel (for people who are clueless, Chicago's mayor-elect!) and Marc Lasry (billionaire CEO of Avenue Capital)! Â They were both very friendly and conversational ... I was impressed :)Service: Â The service was great - the staff was very attentive to our needs and our water glasses never got below half-full. Â Our server was super friendly and helpful as well."
OMG. Slap yo mama good. EVERYTHING. Decor:5Food:5++++service:4I have already made multiple follow-up reservations.EVERYTHING IS GOOD.
"We came here a couple months ago with a large party. We arrived for our 7:30p reservation and were promptly seated. Â I appreciated this as it was a Saturday night and it was super busy. Â We were seated in the back in one of the two tables for 8, and the seating arrangements were super comfy as the table and chairs are generously sized. I loved the ambiance. Â It was dark, modern, sleek. Â And loud. We sat right in front of the kitchen, right by Stephanie as she was directing the dishes out to the floor. Â Our waiter turned out to be a fellow yelper, and he was great in suggesting dishes for us to try. After ordering a couple of bottles of wine, we ordered the following dishes:- All three breads - the one with the honeycomb was the best. Â Mixing soft butter with fresh honey from the honey comb on hot bread was awesome. - Hiramasa crudo with crisp pork belly Â - tasty, but small portioned. the fish was really fresh and pork belly anything is a winner with me.- Oysters (raw) - tasty and fresh.- Soft shell crab Â - the batter was crispy and Â the crab meaty, not overcooked and tender. Â  - Baby octopus with fava and wax beans - well cooked but really heavy handed on both the seasoning and the salt. - Skirt Skirt Steak A La Plancha - I didn't get to try this dish. Â I don't think those who tried it cared much for it though.- Smoked goat pizza - This was alright. Â It had a lot of goat/goat cheese and kale. - Rabbit Rillette - I liked this dish, but I think I might be in the minority here. I thought it was tasty, but yes, it did have a different texture. Some would say it was... mealy?? - Chickpea Fritters / Chickpeas 3 Ways - I did not have this dish but I was told it was fantastic! - Sauteed Green Beans - I also did not have this dish but I heard this was also tasty. - Sugo - One of my favorite dishes. Â What's not to love about pasta in a meat sauce?? -Jumbo prawn stuffed with duck confit - 2 pieces of huge grilled prawn. Â One of my fave dishes of the night. Â Can't go wrong with shrimp and duck. Yum!- Crispy Pig Face - Probably my fave dish of the night. Â It came out in two patties, one on top of each other, separated with shoestring potatoes with a fried egg on top. Â The patties were tasty and crispy, quite porky. Â Funny though, after comparing notes with others who have visited G&G, it seems we've all tried the pigface, but had different variations of the same thing. Â One of my friends said they got one big patty with the pig tongue embedded within it. Another said they got one smaller patty. Either way the version I got that night was really good. - Nougat (dessert) - heard this was fantastic.- fried potato donuts with candied eggplant, fig, honey and greek yogurt (dessert) - good but the nougat sounded better.Most everything that we tried was pretty good. But there were some clear winners. Â Some the dishes that we tried were really salty. I'm glad that the menu rotates, because I would definitely try this place again."
"This was our fourth visit to Girl & The Goat and it was fantastic. Â Our third visit wasn't great, but this time more than made up for it. Â The service was fabulous and the food was wonderful. Â We had the shishito peppers and they were delicious. Â It was the perfect ratio of Â parmesan, sesame, and miso to peppers. Â We also had the chickpea fritters (which I love!) and roasted cauliflower. The fritters were lightly fried Â with just the right amount of crunch.My husband had the oven roasted pig face and I had the wood fired chicken. Â The chicken was very tender and moist. Â It was a wonderful combination with the fried pickles and sauces. Â I honestly was a little apprehensive to try the pig face, well because it's pig face, but it was delicious. Â It was sweet and smokey, perfectly paired with an over easy egg. Â The texture is not what you would expect. Â Its very tender and soft. Â It's not like ham.I would highly recommend the Girl & The Goat restaurant. Â It's a fun, lively atmosphere. Â The interior is very attractive, using reclaimed materials. Â Most importantly, the food is fantastic and unique. Â Finally, it's clear that the staff really enjoy Girl & The Goat and take pride in their work because the service is fantastic."
"So....finally went to Girl and the Goat last night after a three month wait. Â  All in all I had a very positive experience, and thought the food was very good. Â Our waitress was attentive and friendly and our food came out at a great pace, I left stuffed and really enjoyed the beer and wine selection. Â My favorite dishes were the Goat Chorizo Flatbread (ridiculously good) and the grilled hanger steak. Â The vegetables were also very tasty. I am a little taken aback from all the five star reviews....and sort of have to wonder if this sort of has the 'I waited two hours to ride the roller coaster and WOW it was fun....' but if you walked right on the ride it wasn't necessarily as thrilling? Â Weird analogy sorry - however, that's sort of how I think about the Girl & the Goat. Â It was certainly great food, however, the scallops and confit goat belly were somewhat 'eh I've had just as good at other places. Â I should preface this with the fact that everyone at my table was RAVING about the food, I had to keep my sort of mediocre rating to myself. Â So all in all great food, however, I wouldn't go so far as to give the 5 stars!"
"I just had my fifth meal at this place, and as usual, I was not disappointed. It is a great place for innovative American cuisine. Service is always outstanding and I appreciate the knowledge & the patience of the servers. I have some dietary restrictions, and the servers always take the time to point out what options I have on the menu. It is also incredibly affordable. I usually order a drink, the bread, several small plates (which usually I share with my dining companions) and dessert and I leave spending between 40-50 dollars, including a 20% tip.My favorite dishes from my last visit include the sauteed green beans, roasted cauliflower, chickpea fritters & scallops. My friends also had the leg of goat (which you must preorder 24 hours in advance) and have not stopped raving about it. Bread costs extra, but it is worth it. Its always good.In a city that is jam packed with interesting and outstanding dining options, the Girl & the Goat is one of my favorites. Well done."
"Went back to GATG this Friday. The place was packed as usual. Â This time, my dining companion didn't eat pork or shellfish so I was a bit concerned that I wouldn't get to eat anything tasty. Â Boy was I wrong. Â We had:Cod Cheeks - EXCELLENT! flavorful, nice serving size and good to the last bite. It had some caviar/roe in it also. Â Yummy.Skirt Steak - Delicious! Not what you would expect. Â I expected some beef with a few veggies on top. Â Not!! It was excellent.Chickpea fritters - These were awesome, we almost ordered a second plate. Definitely coming back again and again."
"This place had been recommended to me by a friend types of restaurants that I like. The last several times that I was in town I was unable to make it so this trip, I had it as my top priority. We waited maybe 15 minutes to grab a seat at the bar where we planned to dine. Upon opening the menu I knew I was in trouble. Everything in front of me looked wonderful so I chose a few must haves and turned the ordering over to my waiter. I will say that I don't think he could have done a better job choosing my dinner. Every single item was amazing. It was truly one of the most memorable meals that I have experienced in a while. The staff could not have been more attentive and made a great meal even better. Thanks to the wait staff behind the bar and to the chefs. I will definately be returning. Soooooooooooooo Gooooooooooooood!"
"Was obviously drawn here by fact that Girl & The Goat is run by a Top Chef winner. Was not disappointed.They have a very large and diverse menu. Went with my family so we got a wide variety of sides and main dishes.Some of the things we tried were Squash Blossom Rangoon, Kalbi Ribs, Braised Beef Tongue, Mushroom Ragout, Pork Shank, and others. I have to say some were interesting like the Beef Tongue and Mushroom Ragout, but I would not have them again.The others like the Kalbi Ribs and Squash Blossom were very nice and enjoyed by all. Very nice place overall that I would go to and explore again."
"I was very much looking forward to dinner at Girl & the Goat, and the experience - for the most part - lived up to my expectations. Â First and foremost, the food was consistently amazing. Highlights were the fried oysters stuffed with egg salad, ham frites (do not miss them!!!), chickpea fritters, hiramasa crudo, and lamb sausage stuffed calamari. I tried the beef tongue (a first!), which was a pleasant surprise. The beet salad was also nice, although the anchovies were a little fishier than expected. Â We ordered a bread with quince jam to start that was just fine. Desserts were pleasant, and not merely an afterthought. All in all, a feast of the senses!The decor is unusual, very dark and minimalist, but interesting. Â The restaurant smells like a smoke house or wood oven - my coat & scarf smelled like smoke the next day. Â Service was excellent to begin with - when my friends arrived, the hostess noticed our party was complete and immediately came over to seat us. Â However... service at the table was disappointing. Â The waitress told us that we could place our entire order (8 dishes) up front and that she would pace the dishes. Â 5 minutes after placing our order, we had 4 dishes on the table! Â I told the next waiter to arrive that I was unhappy with the pace, that we'd like to slow down. Â He said he'd tell the kitchen. Â 5 minutes later, I had the same discussion with yet another waitress! Â She responded by saying ""So you want me to take this back to the kitchen?"" Â Um, yes. Â One small snag in an otherwise perfect night - but one that should not have happened. Â Ignoring the service issues (perhaps an off night?), I'm excited to revisit Girl & the Goat when I return to Chicago. Â After all, I only got to taste 8 dishes the first time around..."
We lucked out on a trip to Chicago with a few open seats at the bar with no reservation and no wait. We first ordered the wood grilled broccoli topped with creamy blue cheese. The portion size surprised me by how large it was. The cheese really complemented the the woodsy smokey roasted broccoli. Along came a loaf of bread with three different dipping sauces that were OK. Â Next we had the crunchy tempura crab cakes which were delish! After that we had a goat belly with lobster and crab. The belly was very flavorful reminding my almost a cross between beef braise and rehydrated chicharones. The highlight of this plate was the lump crab meat which was jaw dropping succulent. Girl and the Goat was the best restaurant we had the pleasure to experience during our short stay in Chicago. The prices were very reasonable for the quality and portion size; I would definitely come back here in a heartbeat!
"If I could sum up my experience... mediocre and salty.We ordered the olives, green beans, octopus, scallops, ham frites and the chicken. The green beans and the octopus almost tasted like they were cooked in the same sauce and they had one major thing in common... way too salty. The scallops alone were amazing, but the toppings ruined the dished with its overabundance of salt as well. The ham frites were delicious but nothing too special. The chicken was definitely the best part of our dinner and was much needed to balance out all the salty dishes we had earlier in the evening.We went on a night when the executive chef was out of town at a business meeting, so I might consider another visit. However, with the number of amazing restaurants in the city, this will not be my list of suggestions to friends."
"Wow, what to add after all the good reviews! Â We came here on a Monday and had a delicious meal. Â Definitely order some bread - the corny bread with goat cheese melted in my mouth. Â For two people it was just enough, if you have a larger group it might be wise to order multiple. Â We sampled the goat pizza, Â soft shell crab, Â and the grilled octopus. Â All were very tasty, my favorite was probably the soft shell crab. The best thing I think we ate here was the bread - seriously - i would be open to coming here and just do a bread tasting..... Also sampled some of the cocktails, they were quite potent and worth the $$.What struck me about Girl and the Goat was how modern, yet comfortable the atmosphere was. Â I don't know that this will be in my regular rotation of favorite places, but I would definitely come back again to try some of the other dishes. Â My only criticism would be that the dessert offering was pretty 'out there'. Â Being a dessert traditionalist, I didn't see anything that didn't have olive oil or a meat product involved."
"Believe the hype.Place is awesome, service was great and the food was insane.Started with the bread with bacon and banana butter with honeycomb and wheat bread. Nuff said.Squash Ravioli- Deliciously rich and savory. Great vegetarian option.Chickpea Fritters- Not a big portion, but a ton of flavor.Grilled Artichoke- Another rather small portion, but super unique and so much going on.Confit Beef Tongue- Tongue was so tender and delicious. Pickled red onions added a nice contrast to the rich and fatty tongue. great.Veal, Pork and Goat sugo- Pasta was cooked perfectly and the sugo was so rich and delicious. Was awesome you could taste all the different meats, but they went perfectly with eachother.Oven Roasted Pig Face- salty, fatty, delicious. The egg brought the dish together. Seemed that the meat may have been cooked a little long because it was super crispy. Don't know if that was intentional or not, but still great.Pork fat donuts- came with black sesame semifreddo and pineapple sambal. Everything on their own was alright, but combined was insane. So delicious. Spicy, sweet, salty and savory all in one bite.Bittersweet chocolate with shitake gelato- Who thinks of this combination? Once again everything was rather okay on it's own, but delicious when combined.Overall the girl and the goat exceeded my expectations. I can see why its one of the most popular restaurants in America. My tip would be to go with a bunch of people to try a bunch of things. Enjoy!"
"Hands down, one of the best meals that I've had in Chicago so far! We had so many items on the menu that I seriously can't tell you that one thing was better than another...it was all delicious!!!! However, here are some of my favorite dishes/drinks: Drink Menu: Best of Three-awesome Pimms cocktail with Svedka, lime juice, and mint Bread Menu: Bread with whipped goat cheese & corn Vegetable/Fish/Meat Menu: Warm marinated olives-I know what you're thinking...olives?? Yes OLIVES! The olives were incredibly fresh. I mean just picked off the tree fresh. Pan Fried Shoshitos with parmesan and sesame-such a simple dish but so flavorful Seared scallops with almond butter Smoked goat pizza-I've never had goat but it was incredible!!! Pan Seared Chicken-the BEST chicken the that I've ever had!! I definitely recommend getting a reservation although there were a lot of people that waited for tables (for a long time). If you can't eat at a table, you can always eat at the bar or the lounge area. Its seriously worth the wait. I can't wait to go back to Girl and the Goat to sample some different dishes."
"I went here for my birthday last week and it was beyond anything I could imagine. I also ended up being able to eat all of the food we ordered by myself because my dear boyfriend was sick. Sad for him, awesome for me.The dear boyfriend made reservations and we were lead to our table...right across from the kitchen. We got one of the coveted seats and it was exciting because I was turning 24, dammit. And I was eating at my favorite Top Chef's restaurant. Couldn't get any better.We started off with some bread. It was really good bread and I could have eaten the butter plain. So, when you go, get some bread. I chose five plates, thinking that maybe my boyfriend would eat some of them (not a chance). From the veggie section, beet salad and chickpeas three ways. The chickpeas three ways won this here round. It was perfect-all three types of chickpeas were fantastic-the flavors were delicious and really everything just complimented one another. Perfection.Also got the seared scallops with braised veal. Huge, delicious scallops topped with succlent veal. You can't go wrong. I thought this was the best dish I had.Grilled steak with beets and pickles-awesome. Pickles had a touch of the spice, it was awesome. Crispy Pig Face, also awesome. I even ate the egg which GASP had egg yolk (you are starting to grow on me, yolk).At this point, I was so full that I couldn't even contemplate dessert, but everything that I put in my mouth was amazing. Service was great and the atmosphere is very nice. I am glad that I spent the start of my 24th year eating this delicious food. It may or may not have changed my life."
"Been here a few times now and each time our collective meal has been on point. Can't go wrong with this place! The staff is very knowledgeable, helpful and friendly! Save room for dessert, I'm not big on dessert, but had the best dessert ever here. It was some sort of ice cream/corn/popcorn/jam mix in a jar and it was fantastic (but unfortunately, also seasonal)!"
"I'm blown away by my dining experience last night at Girl & The Goat. Everything was delicious. Service was impeccable. The space is gorgeous. And I was fortunate enough to be there with a large enough party that we were able to try almost everything on the menu. It's really difficult to choose a standout dish, but highlights included the oystes (raw and fried were both delicious), the whitefish, which came with a apple gremolata, the pig face (don't be turned off by its unappetizing name - it's the most delicious part of the pig,) the waygu tartare, the escargot ravioli, the hamachi crudo, and the grilled confit duck leg. The only - and I mean only - dish I wasn't over the moon about was the broccoli. It was a little too smoky for my taste, but everyone else seemed to really enjoy it, so I have to chalk that one up to personal preference. Hats off to the hardworking chefs, bartenders and servers - just amazing! I'm so proud to live in a city with such great food."
"What a blast. Â We were a party of six, so we ordered twelve dishes from all across the menu--fish, veggies, all kinds of meat. Â There was a kitchen foul-up on the last dish (flank steak, yum), so we got comped the vanilla butter lobster, and a rolling ""Oh. My. God"" swept around the table in that dish's wake. Â The wine list is unpretentious and the desserts show as much imagination as the dishes from the main menu.Used to be I'd buy a T-shirt at an especially good concert...I came away with a Girl and the Goat T after this visit."
"The hubby and I went on a Saturday night as our ""last supper"" before the baby arrives. Â My husband is so not into trendy and upscale food but even he admitted that we liked everything we ordered.We had the hunk of burning love bread, goat/pork papperadelle, short ribs, and mushroom raisin ravioli. Â Loved all of it - the food was extremely flavorful and balanced.The scene was a little crazy being that it was Saturday night, and the food came out intermittently, not all at once. But even with only 3 small plates, the both of us could not muster dessert (and I am eating for 2...in theory). Â Didn't opt for dessert, but the fudgesicle looked pretty good!I will say that the drinks are pretty pricey - husband had a Hendricks gin and tonic and those cost $10 a piece. Â Ironic that two drinks were as expensive as two dishes.Hopefully one day we'll make it there again when the baby is big enough for a sitter!"
"Not a suprise that this place was absolutely amazing. Â I hate to not give it 5 stars as it really was a great great meal, and I LOVE Stephanie, but it didn't quite live up to what I hoped it would. Â But don't let that take away from the fact that this is an amazing restaurant through and through."
"It has been a couple of weeks since I visited the Girl and the Goat and the expression comes to mind ""I may not remember what you wore, but I will never forget the way you looked!""The ambience is warm, dim lights, loud conversation, modern rustic stylings... just my kinda place.Eronica was our server... that part we will not forget. She was sensational. The perfect mix of informative, friendly, funny and accommodating. If the other waiters are like her, I will give this advice... tell him/her how hungry you are, how adventurous you are, and let them guide you. Plates are for sharing - a little discrepancy between portion sizes eg. the delicious cauliflower 'side' was more filling and substantial than some of the fish dishes, so again, let Eronica or whoever you get, guide you through.Two guys (first anniversary fyi) and we polished off at least seven plates, at least one item from the various menus you will be offered (veg, fish, meat, oysters, cheese, dessert)With a bottle of the least expensive sparkling rose, our bill was about $120 and i would have paid $200... Book in advance is not bad advice... and if you are lucky enough to score Eronica, you are in for a top notch dining experience."
"We had an amazing time. The good: Amazing food! The goat breast was delicious, as was the goat mousse, despite being a bit salty. I loved the octopus and the oysters were good. The portions were large. The meh: The tables were really large so it was difficult having a convo with anyone on the other side, We showed up early for our res, because it was POURING outside. The third member of our party was running late and we were almost denied service do to his tardiness. I wish the hosts would have warned us, as we would have gone on without the third (forget politeness to him, we were hungry). In short: Good food, our waiter was exceedingly cool and had a the best 'stache I had seen in awhile, and the decor was right up our ally,"
"Our server was great. Â The timing was good on the food. Â For three people 6 dishes were too much. Â There is a very curated menu, so if you are picky, not your spot. Very cool and trendy. Â We got in at 9 got our table at 9. Â Great experience. The sommelier was condescending and rude. We said we had just had a Ridge Caboose Zinfandel at home and what would be a good pairing and a follow up to what we had in a number of different varietals. Â He said ""Well you don't want to hit the food over the head with a blunt object"" Â Come on, don't be rude because you think Zin is for the common man. Â Besides that Ridge is delicious 2006 and it was perfect for drinking. Â We know wine. Â What about some poor soul who asks for a recommendation from him. Â Is he going to spit on them with disdain? Oh and the wine was too bitter paired with the food. Â So ask the server, she had great recommendations if you want one."
"This place is fantastic! I tried almost everything on the menu, including:green beans -- amazing!cauliflower -- excellent!peppers -- I could live without (not very exciting when compared to everything else)scallops -- very goodravioli -- solidpig face - a must! the maple is a nice touchgoat - also a must!The wine/cocktail list is mediocre, but everything else was wonderful. Very cool, laid back atmosphere -- no need to dress up, this place is not stuffy.I would definitely recommend this place (if you can get a reservation -- search open table as often as you can!!)"
"SPEECHLESS!It's amazing to me how chef's put together such flavors and make everything compliment each other so well. Don't know what my gf and I did to deserve it but we were given the privilege to sit at the chef's table and saw all the action! It was the best thing that could have happened to us! After getting to know one of the chef's (don't want to mention names..okay his name was Joel =) ), the next thing we knew we were being spoiled left and right with free tastings of some of their most prized dishes. Not to mention the servers were very friendly and knowledgeable and could go into detail about how every dish was prepared. Therefore, I'd say service deserves a perfect score.Here's a recap of all the wonderful things I got to taste:Fried east beach oysters - the egg salad and the fried oyster paired so well that it was a party in my mouth. I think I could eat that everyday if I could. ""Special clams"" (not on the menu) - I don't know what this was called, but it was one of those free tastings we got to try and all I know is, it was goood!Sauteed green beans - This vegetable dish was so good I wouldn't mind eating it alone as my entree. The fish sauce vinaigrette was just a huge burst of flavor that it was addicting!Chickpeas fritters - This was another dish that was given to us as a free tasting and not sure how to describe what was in there but it just melted in my mouth! Grilled baby octopus - This I think I could have skipped, wasn't as flavorful as the other dishes we tried but was still good. Wood oven roasted pig face - This was the ""creme de la creme"" of everything we tasted (well actually I think it's tied to the dessert). Wow! Who knew pig face could taste so good! The meat was so tender that it just melted in my mouth.And finally, dessert. What can I say, I would go back over and over again just for this dessert. After seeing all the different dessert dishes coming out of the expo table, a server pointed out that the absolute best one was the Blood Orange Sorbet with parsnip pot de creme, pistachio cake, and three sisters cornmeal crust. Genius!! Everything in this dessert complimented each other so well, the fresh, tart sorbet combined with the creme brulee flavors, cake, and cookie crust. YUMMMM!!!~ Thank you Stephanie Izard for opening such a wonderful restaurant and exposing such unique, creative, and delightful flavors!! =)"
"I came away with one overwhelming take-away : every dish was extremely SALTY!The layout of the bar area was very uncomfortable, which makes it a stressful wait for your table as you had to constantly dodge people walking through the bar. Â The large space just seemed to be a poor layout overall.The best thing about the place was the bar staff and wait staff. Â Both were very friendly and helpful. Â Their recommendations for navigating the off-beat menu guided us well.The menu was filled with a very eclectic choice of great sounding dishes. Â I was very excited to see such a variety of ingredients and non-standard fare to choose from. Â We ordered 5-6 dishes to share and we all quickly noticed the heavy seasoning of the food. After the first couple of plates, I mentioned to our waitress that our food seemed to be over-salted to the point where my throat had that slight burning sensation. Â She said that they purposely over-season their dishes because they are meant to be shared and they want everyone to experience the full flavor: what??!?The seasoning hid any individual flavors from the primary ingredients and made all our dishes taste very similar. Â I just don't get the extremely positive reviews here. Not one dish was unforgettable at all."
"Finally made it here earlier this week after hearing all about it from friends for months. Â We walked in on a Monday night around 9:30 without reservations and were promptly seated at a family-style table near the kitchen. Â The people at our table were nice and we even shared some food. Â I was nervous that the food was going to be very expensive, but it was actually really reasonable and for a small-plate restaurant, portions were on the larger size. Â For example, two of us ordered bread, a grilled artichoke, the chickpea fritters, some ravioli, and the bittersweet chocolate to share for dessert. Â Way less than the 2-3 recommended plates per person that the waiter was recommending, which, if you've ever read any of my other reviews, you'll know that I find extremely annoying. Â However, Â I left the Girl and the Goat and could barely walk I was so full. Â I had to recline my seat in the car on the way home so as to relieve the pressure. Â That's how much food it was.And what yummy food it was! Â The bread was delish and came with fresh butter and honeycomb. Â The grilled artichoke was perfect, as were the chickpea fritters and ravioli. Â The only thing I didn't personally find out-of-this-world was dessert. Â And I should have known because it was a chocolate pastry with shiitake mushroom gelato from black dog gelato. Â Now, you should know something about me. Â The only food that I absolutely find vile on this entire planet full of things to eat is shiitake mushrooms. Â However, the dessert sounded good otherwise and the guy across the table said the gelato tasted more like red beans. Â I was confused because I've had black dog gelato before and think that they are reliably consistent with realizing their somewhat peculiar flavors in gelato form. Â But I said, sure, let's try it! Â It tasted exactly like shittake mushrooms. Â I should have known! Â BUT, the rest of the dessert was delicious.Loved this place! Â For a cocktail and over-capacity stuffing of two people, I think our total was under 70 dollars. Â Not too bad for the quality of food and service. Â Not too bad at all!I'll definitely be back to check out some of their new menu items as the seasons change."
"All you need to know is wood oven roasted PIG FACE . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix: fbcdn-sphotos-a.akamaihdâ¦. ""Break that egg, let the egg yolk sink into the meat, and take a bite of all of it, meaty and fatty."" Wise words from a wise man, also known as our waiter, and I'm passing it on to you.Since I came here with a vegetarian, all of the other dishes we tried were vegetarian.Most other dishes were good too:+ chickpea fritters . romesco . hazelnut hummus . sesame . goat feta: all three different preparations of chickpeas were divine.+ kabocha squash ravioli . mushroom raisin ragout . brussels leaves . shroom creme fraiche: I think the only thing I didn't like about this dish was the brussels leaves; otherwise all of the textures and flavors tied together really well.+ blood orange sorbet . parsnip pot de creme . pistachio cake . three sisters cornmeal crust: my god this was the perfect dessert.+ bittersweet chocolate . shiitake gelato. toffee creme fraiche: no wait, THIS is the perfect dessert! The shiitake flavor of the gelato literally sneaks in on you 5-10 seconds after you bite into it.Some of the other dishes were ok to bad though:- roasted cauliflower . pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint: the mint was a nice touch, but the other stuff was pretty ok.- sweet potato gratin . rogue river smokey blue . crispy onions: BLECH, for me; my vegetarian friend didn't hate it as much as I did.I had a Three Philosophers to go with my meal, perfect!Oh and our waiter LOVES food, and we loved him for it. The kitchen staff saw me take pictures of them and posed. They are just the coolest bunch! More photos of the meal: facebook.com/media/set/?â¦"
"Wonderful fun restaurant with excellent food. Service was amazing, friendly and helpful. Can't really think of a bad thing about this place, if I am being picky it was a bit loud but I'm old and I don't like kids playing on my lawn either. If you are in Chicago go here, you won't regret it."
"We dined here about 3 weeks ago and wre very impressed with our server's knowledge of the menu and how each of the dishes are created - she was able to explain each of the individual ingredients, how the dish may differ from its more traditional namesake, and what we can expect in terms of taste and texture. Â Two menu items that I will highlight are the pig's face (which is made into a patty and sauteed so it is slightly crispy) and the escargot with meatballs. Â Alas, that night we were too full to do dessert... I would say this place is definitely one of the best restaurants on Randolph Row. Â Stephanie Izzard is really a whiz. :)"
"This is an amazing restaurant. I'm a NYer who is fussy about food and service. I researched places to eat in Chicago for no less than two weeks before adding Girl and the Goat to our food itinerary. It was a good choice!Minor detail - forgot to make a reservation. It all worked out and we didn't have to wait for a table. I would encourage you to make a reservation, however. Possibly a few weeks in advance. The word is out about this place. Must eat: sweet potato gratin, fried oysters and of course...pig face! Delicious. Oink! Also very, very good: chickpea fritters and seared scallops. You can't go wrong with this menu, really.Excellent waitress who made good wine recommendations. I wish this place was in NYC."
"What an AMAZING experience. We arrived (without reservation) and the host was so wonderful and accommodating. The service from the get to was fantastic - exceptionally attentive and very knowledgeable. Becca our server was outstanding in knowing the menu and how accommodations could be made for vegetarian requests. We started with fire roasted oysters - perfection! Next came cauliflower. Now, i like cauliflower to start with but never imagined it could be SOOOO good. The squash ravioli was very nice..... Next came the pig face that I hear from the meat eaters around me was to die for. And the picture I have of my husband's face makes me believe that to be true. The dorade/fish was incredible....... If I had to have a least favorite t would have been the dessert- fudgesicle - But, to be fair, by the time it arrived I was over the top full and happy! We heard it was loud - this is true. We were extremely fortunate to sit next to parties that were willing to converse a bit about the food experience. This was well worth chancing walking in at 4:30 on a Sunday...... by the time we left a bit after 6, the place was packed! Living in the suburbs we don't dine in the city all that often, but there is no doubt e will be back! GO! ENJOY!"
"This is a promising new restaurant. Â I love the concept of small plates of hearty food. Â The restaurant itself is quite attractive. Â The dark space is open and inviting. Â Our group of 3 tried several different dishes based upon the recommendation of our server. Â Everything was really good although nothing was spectacular. Â The highlights were the cauliflower, lamb ribs and crispy pig face. Â A few items were less successful like the chickpea salad and rabbit roulette. Â The service was absolutely flawless. Â All the dishes came out fast with good spacing between the dishes. Â Water was refilled promptly and the dirty plates were quickly taken away. Â  I would definitely like to come back and sample more of Stephanie's menu which will surely change with the seasons."
"You know it's a good thing when you have to separate the excellent from the sublime. Even if the continuous success of Stephanie Izzard's restaurant wasn't evidence, and the inability to get reservations over a week in advance didn't convince you that this place is doing something right, eating the food will. And they do *many* things right.While I mentioned that reservations are hard to come by, we still managed to sneak in at 4:30 on Friday for an early dinner with the caveat that we had to be gone by 6:00. I've also been told by my guide for the evening that bar seating is usually available in some stripe if you don't mind it being a bit packed in. While we didn't have our own table, we were placed at a long table with three other small groups and...you know, I think I liked it better this way. We were free to chat with other people, and as the dishes are meant to be shared there was no stigma to asking what a particularly appealing dish was, or even sharing it between groups. It meant making new friends over the food and wine, and I think it really contributed to the experience. The restaurant had a well worn feel, even if I know it's only been open a few years and I felt really comfortable.Now, for the food. The escargot ravioli was very nice, and the bits of fried onion on top gave it a nice texture. The pork shank was just fun to dig into, the meat coming on the bone with crispy skin and simply falling away as you pulled at it. It came with a few sauces, which I didn't think it needed, and some very nice pita. I would certainly suggesting getting some wine to help cut the fattiness, and the combo really sang. There was a special of goat belly, which paired rather nicely with some fennel for sweetness and went really well some crab meat, which gave the dish some extra sweet and savory notes. But really, the two things that I enjoyed most came from their vegetable offerings. The wood grilled broccoli had a satisfying crunch, and packed a deep rich, savory flavor with the bacon and smoky blue cheese. The shisito peppers are a deceptively complex dish. The Parmesan and miso combine to give a wonderful umami flavor, while the peppers themselves were surprisingly delicately spiced. Overall, it was a wonderful meal, and not one I'll soon forget."
"It's true. Â All of it. Â No, it's not hype. Â The food and drinks are out of this world. Â We ate in the lounge rather than waiting months for a reservation- highly suggest it. Â Everything we ate BLEW our MINDS. Â  Go."
"""Free floooorin'!"" -Guy from Luna Carpet Commercial. Â Who knew that actor was a server at Girl and the Goat? Â Our server, the Luna guy, was super nice, friendly, and politely resisted the urge to sing the Luna jingle. Now to the food. I won't be providing descriptions since you can read that in the 1000+ reviews below or on their menu. Â We ordered: 1. Chicken Little - ORDER IT2. Pig face - ORDER IT. 3. Lambhearts - ORDER IT. 4. Sugo - Highly recommended.5. Woodfired oysters - Highly Recommended. 6. Â Goat belly dish - Not that memorable for me. Order it? 7. Hiramasa crudo - ORDER IT. 8. Rhubarb dessert - If you're still not full, order it. My bf and I went balls out that night and it was worth every penny. Â Definitely one of my top three best restaurant experiences."
"This. place. is. amazing. Â Holy goat!! Â I have a few places that everytime I think of them I begin to salivate and this is one of them. Â Add it to the fancy-pants section of the list with Spring and Sepia. Â We went there on Wednesday and I have literally been dreaming of the blueberry oil and coffee butter bread and the goat cheese baravoise. Â Incredible. Â Absolutely everything that we ordered was top notch and this is hands' down one of the best culinary experiences I've had in Chicago or anywhere. Â  Â The service was superb, the dishes were incredibly well thought out and the decor was tasteful and slightly trendy. Â GO TO THE GOAT, YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED!!"
"Every few weeks my husband and I make different reservations at nicer, quality restaurants such as this as a ""date night"" treat to ourselves. We made reservations 2 months in advance and we were not disappointed. Our order consisted of piper bread, lamb empanadas, goat cheese wontons, green beans, diver scallops, crispy braided pork shank, butterscotch budino and strawberry. The food was excellent, Â (I will dream about those damn green beans and the scallops for months), the atmosphere was fun (we shared bites with our ""neighbors""), but the reason I'm writing was the service. The Â service deserves to be called out! Our waiter was Hunter and he was fantastic. He was fun and passionate about your food and made some great suggestions. Also, your busboys we're so on top of their game we never had to ask for anything. They'd swoop in with smiles, to re-fill a drink, replace a plate and it was all seamless which isn't easy even when the restaurant isn't packed. We have had some great meals on our date-nights, but the tipping point and what continues to bring us back somewhere is always the service....and maybe those scallops or green beans."
"I went with friends and we ate family syle ordering several items from the menu. Everything was fantastic!!! I had the lamb ribs, green beans, roased cauliflower and smoked broccoli. And we even got to mee Stephanie!!!"
Delicious food and fun environment! Went here during a bachelorette party weekend and had the best time. Excited to go back!
"Not worth the 2 month wait. I'm actually not sure what all the hype is about. We started off with drinks, which were probably some of the best things we had here. My husband had an old fashioned, and when he told the bartender it was the best he ever had she proceeded to make an even better one with rye. She also made me an aviation, which was a beautifully balanced and intriguing gin drink.Our waiter was friendly and attentive...at first. He explained the menu to us and happily took our first order. The green beans were ridiculously delicious, and the crudo was nice and fresh. The octopus was a bit chewier than I expected for a nice restaurant like this, but still had good flavor. We moved on to the sugo, which was hands down the best dish we had. Delectable homemade pasta with most delicious and tender meat (I think it was goat, but I don't quite remember). This is about when our waiter had a 6 top seated, and we just flat out lost him. For the finale we ordered the goat liver mousseline, and were horribly disappointed. Granted, we had never had goat liver before but we are fairly adventurous with food and enjoy other kinds of liver. Â This version, however, was inedible. My husband will eat just about anything and after one bite he was done. At the very least I expected somebody to notice that we had eaten almost nothing of it, and ask if it was okay, but nobody cared. We would have politely said it just wasn't our thing anyway, but it would have been nice if somebody had cared enough to ask.When the plate was finally taken away, we waited 10-15 minutes for our waiter to reappear and ask us about dessert. At this point we had 30 minutes to make it to our metra train (the station is 4 minutes away). Plenty of time for dessert, right? Absolutely wrong. After the waiter brought us the dessert menu he was gone for another 10-15 minutes. With only 15ish minutes to spare now we had to pass on dessert. Honestly the last 45 minutes of bad service is what made me wish we had never gone. It is so frustrating to sit and wait, especially when you can see the waiter at the bigger tables but can't get his attention.So overall, the drinks are fantastic, the food is good with a hint of great, but the service absolutely needs work."
"My friends and I made a reservation for the first available Thursday night back in January... which was this past Thursday, April 14. Â Definitely worth the wait. Â There were six of us and we each ordered 2 of the small plates, so we got to try a good portion of the menu. Â Everything was delicious. Â My most favorite was the goat belly with lobster - super indulgent goodness! Â Closely following in second place were the roasted goat empanadas. Â I'm sort of a sucker for empanadas. Â Everything else was basically tied for third - all totally delicious. Â Cocktails were great and pretty strong, which is good since they were $12. Â I think I was actually surprised that we got out of there for just under $60 per person, including drinks (we each had only one) and tip. Â The atmosphere was a little fancier than I had expected - maybe because a lot of people come straight from work? Â I was expecting a more casual, gastro-pub scene. Â Nevertheless, you definitely wouldn't be turned away for showing up in jeans in sneakers.We'll be making our next reservation soon!"
"I'm debating whether or not I should rate this place only 3 stars. I feel like if I did, the hipsters will find out where I live through my ip address and hang me. I honestly thought this place was just A-OK. The only reason I'm saying this is because for all the hype, this place didn't live up to it. I have to admit, the food was well prepared and good... but why is there a 3 month waitlist for a reservation? It's not THAT good nor is it super unique. Tasted 7 dishes and that included the famous ""pig face"" which was probably the best plate they had. It was good... but it wasn't something to die for. The Korean Kalbi short ribs were just whatever. They did have this green chili on there that made it better but for the price, it's pretty ridiculously small. The oysters left me with wanting more, and their beer cheese spread just tasted like cheese and mayo. The goat leg shank was good, but like everything else at this restaurant, it was too salty. I like salt on my food but this was too much. Waking up the next day thirsty out of my mind is not cool.I think I would give this place another chance but too bad I have to wait until May. Pretty disappointed that it didn't live up to the hype, but who cares, everyone else loves it. And with that said, I would recommend you try it at least once but I'm sure I don't have to tell you that, the hype already did."
"Made reservations well in advance for a recent bachelorette trip in Chicago. Â We were sat almost immediately (granted, we had the 5pm reservations). Â We also pre-ordered the goat leg because we wanted to know what all of the fuss was about. Â Well, the experience definitely lived up to the hype. Â All of our dishes were delicious and unique and the wait staff was on top of everything. Â You will never be without a full glass of water, even if you tried. Â And our server worked with our table to figure out how many side dishes we needed to complete the meal. Â We drank a lot of the Sexual Chocolate red wine which was fitting for our mood and the bachelorette party. Â I highly recommend getting the goat leg (order ahead of time) and you will spend the rest of your night arguing on which of the 6 side sauces was the best. Â This was one of those meals that you'll remember for a long time to come! And as a sweet side bonus, they do have a pretty kickass soundtrack playing in the back. Â No cheesy ambiance music for The Girl & The Goat."
"After going to the Publican and coming away disappointed (owing perhaps to the hype?) I was a little leary about another gastropub letdown. I was not. We called the afternoon of, and were able to get reservations for later that evening (around 10--on a weekday).Food was great, drinks were great, ambience was great. What can I say? The reviews are true."
"We had reservations for 10 p.m. on Friday night for 4 people - Our table was ready when we arrived. Our server was attentive, incredibly knowledgeable about the menu, and recommended to us how to pair dishes to create a well-balanced meal. Service was not rushed and we actually didn't end up leaving until close to 1 a.m. - the plus side of having a late reservation.Onto the meal - we started with bread, which was supposed to be a play on soup flavors (broccoli cheddar and tomato), and I gobbled up my piece covered in delicious spreads.Then, we ordered 10 plates for the 4 of us to share. Unfortunately after most dishes, I found myself saying, hmm, it's really good, but is it a little bit too salty? The flavors were rich and unique, but I felt that most plates were a tad over-seasoned. The green beans were fantastic as well as the pork ribs special. The meat fell off the bone. I could have eaten 3 more plates and this was the last course served and I was full. That's how good it was. There was not a bad plate in the meal. AND apparently they get all of their products from local farms. I would definitely go back and am excited to try some of their other options."
"Finally got to give this place a try and see what all the hubbub is about. Â The goat liver mousseline was amazing!!! Â Also really liked the fennel salad. Â Did the crispy pig face but was underwhelmed. Â This dish may be skating by on its bizarre foods/scary name cachet. Â Excellent beer selection.Overall, it was a very good dining experience and crazy busy for a Monday night. Â I would not hesitate to go back."
"When I told my friend that I wanted to go to Girl & the Goat she said it would be almost impossible to get a reservation only a couple of weeks advance. Sad face. But she said they reserve a certain number of tables for walk ins, and that the wait wouldn't be too bad if we went early. Happy face. We arrived just a little after 5 pm and the place was already jumping. It had a very modern casual vibe going, which I really liked. We knew we'd be in for a good wait so we grabbed a couple of drinks at the bar. The 2 hrs actually went by faster than expected. We were pleasantly surprised by our host when she found us standing near the bar to let us know our table was ready. Is this a common thing? I don't know, maybe I don't go to enough nice restaurants? Nonetheless I was impressed. We were seated at one of the two large communal tables in front of the kitchen. It was unfamiliar to have strangers sitting across from us, but we made some small talk but quickly ceased when the conversation started to feel forced. Our waiter was excellent. He was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave us some great recommendations. We started with the Not Campbell which came with mushroom soup butter and tomato soup oil. Delicious. I could eat that butter with some bread all day long. Then came out the roasted beet salad. It was very refreshing and a great way the cleanse palate. We also got the Hirmasa Crudo and the Kalbi Style Beef Ribs which were the bomb! It was fall off the bone tender...so good - definitely the best dish we ordered. We finished with an Orange sorbet on a pecan cake. This was a fantastic meal and more than exceeded our expectations. To top it off we got to meet Stephanie Izard and take a picture with her. What what!"
"Being a native Chicagoan I am pretty skeptical, okay really skeptical! Â So, I walked into Girl and the Goat hearing Public Enemy's, ""Don't Believe the Hype!"" and left Â singing the Monkey's ""I'm a Believer!""We had an amazing, taste bud awakening meal, eating what I would call Â staples: bread, chicken, short ribs, green beans, chick peas and blood orange sorbet. Â  The breads were paired with spreads that had so much flavor you could eat them on their own. Â  Â The chick pea fritters and the romesco were amazing and the green beans...seriously, I might have to use them as my next facial mask. Â Chicken really, it was just chicken? Paired with the confit empanada, root vegetable caponata and caper vinaigrette, I didn't know that chicken could be that complex! Â The blood orange sorbet with parsnip pot de creme, pistachio cake, three sisters cornmeal crust was out of this world (although you might take that with a grain of salt, because I think you could put blood orange anything on a rock and I'd like it!)Our server was knowledgeable and friendly, helping us only as much as we asked and knowing when to walk away. Â She guided the tables around us, delicately and being honest with them about ordering too much. Â Please don't let the descriptions scare or discourage you, they know what they are doing. Â I was with a non-seafood eater which was so disappointing because their seafood selection sounded amazing. Â I can't wait to go back for razor clams, skate and calamari!BTW - Maybe we are blessed by a reservation foodie goddess, but we called for a Friday night reservation 10 days ago and well, I am writing this review tonight...so I am not sure about the 3 month wait."
"We dined at 6:45 pm on Wed. 7/13/2011Food was over salted and just not that great.Beet salad: My girl friend liked it...not a fan of beetsEscargot Ravioli- I love escargot. I don't think you can go wrong with it. But the presentation was not very appetizing and the ravioli was under cooked. I didn't finish eating it because it was turning me off.Lobster bread: Fresh bread is always good. Served with some kind of tartar sauce which I thought tasted bad, but my girl friend liked it. I just stuck with the butter.Soft shell crab: My girl friend said this was her favorite and she is from Baltimore and loves loves loves crab. I took a bite...again it was ok.Walter's Chicken: The chicken was cooked perfectly. Â This is big enough to share. Â But it came with 4 different sauces (lets call them that for argument sake): fried sweet pickles (not a fan at all and I was really pulling for them), some kind of spicy red sauce, some kind of relish, and Â two others. Â You can look on the menu. Â They all tasted terrible with the chicken. I was very disappointed.Pig face: Never had it. My girl friend and I were hopping you got the entire head. But it comes in slices that are breaded and fried. Â It honestly tasted like something you would eat at a truck stop. Â A friend of mine told me that is a very delicate piece of the pig. Â If that is true, they completely ruined this dish. Â Neither of us liked this at all and were complete disappointed.With drinks and tip our dinner was 190. I usually don't mind spending this much if the food is out of this world. But I felt I was completely ripped off.Also my girl friend complained to to me the next morning that she had woken up in the middle of the night. Her lips were swollen and she had to chug a half gallon of water.I've heard from several people that this place was awesome. But I think people get caught up in the hype. Â Over all the food wasn't poorly cooked itself, but the ingredients in the dishes do not go well together. Â I think people get excited by them because when reading, they do sound good. But when you get it, the dish flops.However, the bathrooms are private and large enough to have a quicky in...hence the two stars :)."
"Well, it took a couple of months to get a rez, but worth the wait. Â Crowded place! Â Had to wait about 5 minutes for the table. Not an issue.Started out with warmed marinated olives. Â Excellent marinade, clever twist to warm them, which even on the hottest day in Chi history was welcome, as the place was cool and comfortable. Â  Other starter was the pretzel, which came covered in butter, with, haha, a side of butter and some delicious house-made 1000 Island. Â Wonderful. Â I'm a beet fan and the salad surpassed my expectations. Scallops were seared to perfection; sauce was rich and tasty. Â Sugo: pasta had perfect texture, sauce, again, rich, tasty, meaty, hearty. Â I'm not a wine expert, but the selection was interesting and the bottle we had was great. Service was excellent: helpful and attentive, but not too overbearing."
"Amazing, wheat bread with peanut butter and honeycomb! The ""pig-face"" was literally the best thing I've ever had. Oysters were grilled and delicious, shishito peppers were awesome. Ceviche may have been the best as well."
"Dearest Girl and the Goat,You served me the tastiest, most impeccably seared scallops that I've ever had in my life (and I'm a total seafood snob)! Amazing, thank you. Â Also, your chickpea fritter was intriguingly savory and beyond anything I would imagine a chickpea to offer. Â Your small plates are truly flavorful, thoughtful food combinations. Â I appreciate your interesting beer selection. And your service was exceedingly hospitable, helpful, and fun. Â What a fab dining experience in a great space. Thank you much!! Â I will be back. Â  Â  Â Love it."
"Alright, so a friend and I have been trying to get a table here at a reasonable time for the past 6 months. Every time we called (weeks in advance) the only times available were either blue hair special time or bed time. So naturally, this enticed us even more. The last time we called, we got a tip from the other side of the phone that the bar and lounge area were first come first serve and that we could give that a shot. So we did...We walked through the door at about 7pm on a Tuesday to a packed house. To our luck, a group was just getting up at the lounge and we snaked into their seats. I didn't get to scope out the entire place, but it seemed pretty relaxed and approachable. We had a few share plates but my highlight was the pig face. This dish is a must try if you are not a foodie light like my friend (who thought I was crazy for eating it). Followed it with pork fat donut for dessert, YUMMY. I would, and will, go back, but wouldn't go out of my way to book a crazy hour of dining just to have a seat."
"My aunt was in town and being a big Top Chef fan she really wanted to try this restaurant. Â Unfortunately, it was near impossible to get a Friday night reservation (granted I tried only that week so I wasn't surprised) but we decided to go in and have a couple drinks at the bar and maybe an appetizer or two. Â The first thing I noticed was the incredibly friendly and outstanding waitstaff. Â Our waitress had the right balance of being friendly and knowing when to be attentive and when to let my aunt and I catch up. Â We were seated on the couch/lounge area (btw...if you can't get reservations go in and sit in the lounge...if you don't mind eating your dinner on the giant couch). Â My aunt had a couple Pims drinks and I had the house red. Â For appetizer we had the pork belly and and it was nothing short of outstanding! Â For $14 you didn't get much but it was worth the splurge.The restaurant itself was very cozy...modern without being cold. Â It had a bit of a pub like look to it on the outside. Â It felt very casual but nicer at the same time.By the time my husband met up with us we decided that for the evening we wanted a more substantial meal. Â Not knocking the 'goat...the plates weren't huge and we felt like having a big celebratory meal. Â It's just their style. Â However I do plan on returning when my husband and I have the occasion to celebrate with a very excellent meal."
"""Ball so hard...."" sorry, i have that song in my head, especiaslly since I did feel as important as Jay-Z and Kanye when I came to this place with two other friends. We were seated quickly which was amazing considering what I read about getting reservations and the number of people already around. I liked the feel of the place, and it looked very cool, however i wasnt blown away. the prices for the portions were ridiculous, however everything we ate was amazing. im not a big veggies guy, but the few things I did eat were AWESOME. Agagin, great food, but we need to work on our portions, goat chick. Our waitress, who's name may have been taylor or something starting with a T was super amazing, and I'd probably go back just because of how nice she was to us!"
"Da BOMB. My second time was even better than the first, the energy in the place is great. Confident but not pompous at all! The wait staff is super friendly and conversely very informative and opinionated. Food was amazing. The goat liver pate with pickled cauliflower and crumpets was so memorable! The fried oysters with warm egg salad (sounded odd) totally delivered. Basically everything that I put in my mouth was super yum yum yum. Desserts were not as amazing, but I didn't really care at that point."
Came here and sat at the bar. Â Ordered the octopus and the scallops and I thought the food was a little salty but the flavors were good. Â Also had a mojito that was good but nothing too special. Â I was probably expecting more but I also didn't order that much food.
"Don't wait to get a reservation at Stephanie Izard's Chicago establishment as this place fills up fast. They do take walk-ins and really try to work people in. My Chicago peeps tell me that this isn't a great plan prior to 9pm but you have a good shot after that. I ended up having a late dinner on a Tuesday night with the place still rocking at 9:30. The food was well worth it. The bread is exceptional and I wanted to order them all before settling on the beet bread. I'm glad I used my better judgment as loading up on bread would have been totally silly. I think my favorite dish of the night was the sweet potato gratin. As it came to the table I exclaimed, ""It smells amazing and looks like sin."" It lived up to this potential as the sweet potatoes blended perfectly with the smokey blue cheese. The roasted cauliflower is not to be missed, it came highly recommended by our waiter and after we savored every bite he came out and described it's preparation to us, he listed up 3 different things that were the ""real trick"" which made me realize it's best to leave this dish to the experts. If you're in Chicago I highly recommend stopping by the GIrl and The Goat, everyone else in town is doing it, and for good reason!"
"Tried to do another business dinner here, and again we were rebuffed by their rude and unhelpful hostesses. I think I'm done trying with this place. I don't go in for the theory that if you have good product you can treat your customers like crap - this is Chicago, and we've got plenty of other options. Later, Girl."
"Flash back to sometime in October. I thought, hey why don't I try and get a reservation at Girl and the Goat, knowing that the BF is a Stephanie Izard fan. OpenTable says earliest workable reservation is January 8th. Flash forward to last weekend.We arrived a little early for our reservation and were seated at the bar until our table was ready. The restaurant decor is very simple but elegant, with lots of dark wood and minimalist lighting. We ordered drinks at the bar. The BF ordered a Jardin, which was basically a margarita but with some additional ingredients, including elderflower. I ordered a Dark and Stormy, which was 2 types of rum with ginger ale. Both drinks were delicious and had lots of layered flavor.After a short while, we were seated at our table. Many of the tables are very close together so you can check out what other people are ordering. The waitress recommended we order 2-3 plates per person, so we got:Bread with bacon/beer compote- I could have eaten 10 plates of this. Beer? Bacon? Does it get better?Chickpea fritters- so delicious, with a little heat. The BF ate these, and he doesn't even like chickpeas! The fritters also come with roasted whole chickpeas.Shishito Peppers- Loved the combo of sesame seeds and parmesan! Lots of peppers though, we couldn't finish them. Lamb/Veal/Goat Sugo over Papardelle with gooseberries- My favorite of the night. The meat was packed with flavor and the berries added a nice sweet/sourness.Skirt Steak- The BF ate this and said it was cold but had good flavor.Roasted Pig Face- didn't look like a face, but was so good. Imagine a nice ham steak with bacony flavorPork fat fried doughnuts with sesame ice cream- so rich and deliciousThe whole bill without drinks was about $100. Not bad considering we were stuffed. Service was impeccable. We will definately be back (hopefully not 4 months from now)!"
"A gustatory adventure! Wonderful food, exciting flavors, excellent service. Thank you for giving me something truly special to treat my parents with during their visit from San Francisco. Even coming from a foodie town, they were truly impressed with G&G."
Such delicious flavor combinations. We came with friends and ordered a lot of dishes. My favorite was the cauliflower with pinenuts. I also loved the lamb shank that they brought out on a cutting board and you got to make your own little pita sandwiches. The apple crumble in the jar with bacon icecream was also amazing. I love this place!
"absolutely wonderful food extravaganza!!! my bud & i indulged in: oysters topped w/ egg salad & capers, roasted beet salad, green beans, halibut, goat shank, & the milk chocolate sponge cake. (WHEW!)...oh! & the ""blood & goats"" for my cocktail.everything was fresh & tantalizing. service was great & the ambiance was fab!...can't wait 2 go back!!!"
"Surpringly young crowd. Surpringly casual crowd. Â  Surprisingly loud inside. Â Maybe it's because I'm an old goat (ha ha), but given the ratings and the price points, I was expecting older and Â by no means formal, but not a shorts and sandals crowd. Â The food was as unique and exceptional as anticipated. Â The servers knowledgeable and friendly."
"Went last year, so things may have improved. For the money and type of experience, if recommend foodies hit Moto or the sister restaurant ING, in the similar locale. Food was of course very innovative and fresh, but it really did not amaze anyone at the table. Big disappointment."
"""It was a party in my mouth, and it just hasn't Â stopped."" To echo a response from one of my fellow diners, ""I agree, and each dish is a different song.""The best way to describe it is: it's not a meal, but more of an journey. It left me with may different tastes that I've never experienced before; you'd never guessed half of the ingredients in each dish would taste so well together! When you go out with a group of ten people, and no one at the table is talking because they're too busy eating, it's a good sign.On this night, I was lucky enough to be served the tasting menu; I got to experience and taste 12 of the best dishes on the menu. Everyone will have their favorites, but if I were to visit the Goat again I'd go for the Escargot Ravioli (and I don't normally eat escargot!) and the Lamb Tartar. You can't go wrong with the Green Beans (that's what everyone says, and everyone is right!), and Sugo is a different dish to try (Me: ""I don't know what this is, but I definitely like what's going on in my mouth right now!""). Try the Organic Apple cider off the beverage list to wash everything down. It was pricey bottle, but it was quite tasty.Other things that I noticed: The place was super busy for a Tuesday night. Stephanie Izard was standing at the end of the food line facing the kitchen, there throughout the night. Kudos to her for being very hands on with her place; she's that busy approving each dish before handing them off to the waiters; at the same time having quick convos with random diners. Awesome in my book. Wait staff was excellent with food questions that were asked (thanks Meadows!). There's nothing more that you can say about this wonderful, wonderful masterpiece of a restaurant. I think there are not enough adjectives in the English language for me to describe. It's nice to know that this is one place that lived up to the hype, and even though booking a table may mean waiting for three months or more, it's worth the wait.Oh yes, I'd definitely go back. In a heartbeat."
"I know this is cheesy since it's V-day... but I'm in LOVE! Â With a girl and her goat!! Â (And my husband) Â I had very high expectations and GATG delivered. Â The waitstaff was friendly and very attentive (shout out to Meadows!), the beer selection was great, and the food...oh man...starting to drool again. Â I ate there last night and just made reservations for another visit."
"Walked in at 5:30 on a Wednesday knowing that we would either wait for hours or not get a table at all, but they told us that if we could be done by 7:00 we could have a table right away. Deal. We split 10 dishes between 3 people. You definitely shouldn't miss:1) bread (yes, they charge $4 for something that should be free. yes, it's worth it)2) pig face (if you didn't catch this from the other 1,000 reviewers)3) goat sausage pizza4) grilled baby octopus (this was possibly my favorite dish, right up there with the pig face)Our waitress obviously knew about our need to clear the table by 7:00, but we never felt rushed. The small plates came out with perfect timing (and as we noted later, in the perfect order), and we were signing the check at 7:00 on the dot."
"This was my second time around. Â Again the most flavorful bits of food I have ever had. Â Each time I have gone I have had the seared scallops. Â They are to die for. Â They are cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. Â Then we have the pork empanadas. Â Over all they were okay. Â The presentation was a little dull, but the meat just melted away in your mouth. Â Then we had the cauliflower. Â This was amazingly seasoned and the best course of the meal. Â Finally we had the pork belly. Â This was just amazing as always. Â IIf you want to get in on the community tables (no reservations) go on Tuesdays or Wednesdays at like 5 or 5:30, you can totally get in.Make sure to make reservations otherwise. Â So darn good. Â Never had a boring or bland meal! Â Amazing!"
"food was good, service sucked and they rush you out the door the second you're done. They also spilled plates on the birthday girl and didn't really apologize..instead blaming an drunk girl at the bar for knocking into the busboy. The wait for this place is ridiculous...I mean there is no way this place is good enough to wait a month for...I guarantee you will be disappointed...or maybe you won't...kinda like the $5 milkshake effect from pulp fiction. I didn't wait since we knew someone..maybe if I had I would've liked it more...who knows."
"Had to see what the hype was all about, and the hype was right. Â Chef Stephanie Izard has the place down pat. Â The service was impecabble and there she was checking and directing the food the entire time. Favorites:Goat belly with lobster - simply divine, the sauce was ridiculously good.Goat, pork, veal sugo on pappardelle - great taste and textureBlood orange sorbet Â with parsnip pot de creme - please do not leave without enjoying this dessert, just the right amount of sweetness to finish off a carniverous meal.Others:Green beans - yes, the flavor is that goodPork face with egg - the pork face was cooked extremely well but the sweetness of the tamarind sauce had me wondering where my pancakes wereGrilled oysters Â - my least favorite because they were dried out.No reservations, so we waited about an hour and a half. Â Great ambiance though to relax and wait. Â Overall, a winner!"
"Definitely a great experience and a fantastic value. Â The food was excellent as was the atmosphere. Â My favorite dishes were the goat empanadas, the rye bread (always try at least one of the breads!), and the pork ribs. Â The grilled baby octopus and the scallops were also fantastic. Â The 4 leches dessert with blueberries was the perfect end to our meal. Â Our server was helpful and attentive and we look forward to returning again."
"I've never said the F word so many times during a meal, as in ""Oh, f@#% this is good."" Â This was our first time at Â G&G, and one of the best meals we've had in many years of dining out in Chicago. Â Every dish that came was better than the last one, which is rare at even the finest restaurants. So, about the food.Pig face:a decadent, amazing start. Even if you don't eat a lot of meat, you will eat this and be very glad you did.Chickpea fritters: very solid. Â A little familiar, not remarkable, but very enjoyable.Cauliflower: my cauliflower-hating husband chowed down on this. Â Amazing.Sugo: I want to bathe in it.Mushroom ragout: No wait, I want to bathe in this.Braised pork: ""crispy"" means they actually deep fry it after they braise it. Â Tastes like delicious fried chicken. Â With the sauces it's a clever take on wings.Cocktails and desserts were perfect complements to the meal.Portions are bigger than expected. Â Our server Marni was incredibly helpful, kind, and seemed to enjoy every bite along with us. Â We ran into Stephanie at the end of the meal and were happy to have the chance to thank her personally. Â Now I have to go make our next reservation...See you in 3 months, Girl and the Goat!"
"went back 2nd time and food was even better. Â Please go,, it's so worth the wait!"
"Food is outstanding. Service is impeccable. You order a bunch of things and share and you sit at a large wooden table that - if you don't have a party of 10 - you'll be sharing with another party but it's fun! Great wine and cocktail selection. We enjoyed a variety of oysters and a ton of different dishes. The atmosphere is like a french country house and you can look over and see what's happening in the kitchen, great place for groups!"
"Our group of 4 called in March or April for our June reservation and waited with baited breath for the big night. Â It was a Tuesday, and the place was packed. Â Beautiful space and Stephanie Izzard was actually expediting, which I didn't expect to see! :) Â Everyone was super friendly from the minute we walked in. Â I think our only complaint was that despite reservations (made months ago!), we still had to wait about an hour to be seated, which was a disappointment. Â That said, once we dug in to dinner, it was deeeeelish. Â The kitchen sent out a bevvy of complimentary dishes and even a complimentary desert. Â (much appreciated) Â From oysters to lamb heart to pig face--all in all we got about 15 dishes which we all shared and spent a couple hours devouring as they came out. They do a great job of taking your order in its entirety (so don't think tapas small plates) so that they can pace your meal and send things out in the order that will help each dish bring out its best. Â So you don't get the heavier pig face along-side a lighter dish of asparagus. Â It seemed such a common sense and perfectly smart way of doing such a meal. Â I really appreciated the thought that went into presentation. In terms of taste, I'd say that of the 15 or so dishes we tried, only couple failed to really impress (but we still liked them!!). Â A few were just ridiculously good. Â I almost felt guilty at how much I enjoyed them. Â And the majority were just solid, delicious and perfectly done. Â  Our server was super friendly, and obviously knew the menu like the back of her hand. This was definitely a happy dining experience. Really great food and a really impressive drink selection with lots of crafty brews on tap. Â Loved it."
Awesome service - very professional. Food was excellent; really enjoyed the entire experience. Id go back in a heartbeat - recommend!
"Went there on Friday night with no reservation. Â The wait was about 2 hours, but we quickly grabbed a seat at the bar. Â They serve the same menu at the bar. Â We had a few drinks and started to ordered. Â Plates are small and meant to be shared. Â The pig face with the sunny side up egg was one of the best things I have eaten ever. Â This was a worth ever dollar."
"What more can I say about how great this place is that hasn't already Â been said in the other 500+ reviews. Truly amazing food and atmosphere presented here. Do yourself a favor and get a reservation ASAP or even better, try dating someone on the staff to assure getting in sooner. Just kidding, no but serious maybe it might work. Something that are must tries are the green beans, cauliflower, and fried oysters. I would avoid the goat breast dish unless you like gelatinous fat on top of tasty meat. I didn't mind but others had different opinions on it.Goat on!"
"I cannot say enough wonderful things about GATG. My hubby and I had been jonesing to go, but didn't want to wait 2 months for a reservation, so we showed up at 5:30 on a Friday evening and after 10 minutes of waiting, we were seated at a great table near the bar. Yes, we ate with the early bird crowd, but I don't regret it because others who arrived just after us were still waiting at the bar when we left after our meal!Our server was friendy, unpretentious and full of great suggestions. We started with one of their special breads which came with a lobster butter - YUM. This was followed up by a menagerie of dishes, each one better than the last: the sugo, the green beans, the pig face, oh my! We received an order of chickpea fritters by accident so we gobbled those up and felt super lucky that they'd accidentally arrived at our table, because they were fantastic. We split their little lemon/rhubarb dessert and a coffee at the end of the meal and waddled away satisfied.The only dish that didn't blow me away was the goat empanadas, which were a bit soggy for me, like they had been sitting for a few minutes before coming to our table. But the goat meat was tender and delicious, so I really can't complain too much.Please do yourself a favor and get to Girl and the Goat ASAP!"
"I don't really know what I can say here that hasn't already been said, but I guess I'll give it a go anyway...I've been to the Girl and the Goat about three times now, and never on a reservation. Yes, yes... I'm that ninja girl who's always prowling up and down the bar, looking for seats to snatch. Sue me. The first time I came, I had had three beers before we snagged ourselves seats and as a result, was too tipsy and too engaged in conversation to accurately remember the food that well, other than ""it was so yummy!"" The second time, my friend and I came pretty early (around 5:30?) and managed to grab a pair of seats at the bar within 10 minutes of arriving. Score! Third time, we were a party of four who decided to come spontaneously and were lucky to find seats on the couches near the entrance. Let me just say - it's pretty awkward eating when the table level is at your knees. It gets a LOT messier, what with you dropping crumbs and sauce all over yourself (at one point, I think I dropped oil from the bread into my glass of water? so classy...)Anyways. The food. I mean, it is pretty DAMN delicious. I love the small plates set-up and being able to taste more things. I'm of the opinion that all restaurants should serve everything tapas for this reason. I also like that they have a huge selection of vegetable dishes (read: not vegetarian... some of these do have meat in them too, but the emphasis is on veggies). My main gripe with most Western cuisine is that chefs only know how to serve vegetables as boring side dishes or as garnish. NO! There are soo many wonderful things that you can do with vegetables, and Stephanie Izard proves it! Delving into the dishes that I've tried...Green beans - delicious, as everyone has already said 23524 times. You will never be able to eat regular green beans after this. Fish sauce and aioli drenched, with cashews. I hated cashews up until the moment I tried this. That's how life-changing it was. Savoury and delicious, very heavy on flavour. Roasted cauliflower - had this my first time, while rather tipsy. It was good, and that's all I have to say about that. Shishito peppers - my friend ordered this and the waitress told us that 1/10 are spicy, 9/10 are not. It took me forever to find a spicy one, and even then, it wasn't THAT spicy, at least to my Sichuan-numbed tongue. Yummy, but not that special. Also, a bit on the oily side. Roasted beets - I dropped a slice of beet on my menu and left a lovely red stain, haha. This was a nice, refreshing salad, but not particularly fantastic. I couldn't tell where the white anchovies were, although my friend pointed out that they might've been the random small crunchies? Wish the anchovies had been featured more. Creme fraiche was good and raw green beans were surprisingly delicious. Grilled baby octopus - REALLY REALLY good. I also had this while tipsy, but I know it was delicious. It had a very smoky flavour, which I loved, but wasn't as terribly savoury as the green beans.Fried soft shell pakora - I think the sauces were the star of this dish. I love crab, but the crab itself would've been nothing without the amazing sauces. I wanted to lick my plate. Goat chorizo flatbread - definitely my favourite thing that I've ever tasted here. I just love the flavour of the chorizo with the ricotta. I could probably eat two whole flatbread by myself. Mmmm. Lamb tartare - my friend ordered this. It was interesting. I have no idea what the chip that you put the tartare and peas on is, but it was good. I don't know if I would order this myself, but it was unique...Ham frites - I thought these would be sticks of fried ham, but it's actually french fries with bits of fried ham used as seasoning? Really really bad for you, but it was hard to stop eating these. At the very end, the pieces of fries were so small that we just dumped the sauces in and dug at it with our forks. So refined, yes. Breads - just get one. They're just so good. I've had a Lady Grey flavoured one (mmm, bergamot), one called 'Fat' (with liver butter), and another one that was pretty normal, but still sickeningly delicious. Drinks - skip the cocktails, they're nothing that special. Go to Aviary or the Violet Hour afterwards or something. Beers are awesome though!Some final words to wrap up this horrendously long review. Food gets an A+! I wish to someday sit by the kitchen and watch the chefs at work. The third time we were here, we actually got a dish of green beans on the house, which was very nice. Sitting at the bar was perfectly fine, as the bartenders are perfectly attentive servers. Sitting on the couch... not so much. Tough to eat, and it's hard to get servers' attention. It also gets pretty loud in there as it gets later, and I really, really wish this place isn't as busy as it is, because I'd love to be able to get a table without booking a month in advance or waiting an hour and a half at the restaurant. The end!"
"Finally. After over 2 months, we got our big group out here for dinner.First of all, the space is beautiful. I've read about how much effort the Boka Group spent on the design, and it definitely shows. We started off with cocktails, and we were all happy with our selections.Amazing: Raw Oysters - Crisp and fresh.Wood-grilled Oysters - Lightly grilled and very juicy.Hamachi Crudo (x2) - So clean and crisp - they held the pork on the side for our chosen friends. Goat Carpaccio (x2) - Light and flavorful - definitely order this one.Lamb Heart - Very tender and not chewy at all - probably my favorite.Sweet Potato Gratin - Whole table raved about this one.Green Beans - Lightly cooked with fish sauce. Sour and tasty!Good: Baby Octopus - Delicious and a big portion.Goat Belly - Fatty and tasty. Halibut - Whitefish with grilled blueberries.Meh: Seared Tuna - Not that exciting.Pork Face - Granted it was at the end of our meal, but it felt too rich.The vegetable dishes were a real shocker. Who knew humble green beans in fish sauce with cashews could taste this good? Not to mention the sweet potato gratin, which made the whole table swoon. We also had two of the bread items, but I frankly can't remember much about them. One was a loaf of rye and the other was...For dessert, we had a rhubarb and lemon shortcake, which was pretty damn good. At meals end, we were all stuffed. I think, in retrospect, four is always the ideal number for shared plates restaurants. Overall, it's a great restaurant, and I hope the rush of tourists as a result of the (deserved) positive media slows down sooner rather than later."
"Incredible. It was my first time in Chicago and living in the San Francisco Bay Area, I was pretty certain that our food is some of the best in the country - until I came to this restaurant. Â In a nutshell, the quality of ingredients, the pairing of flavors, and the elegance of presentation was absolutely mind blowing; haven't had a meal like this in a while. Goat carpaccio, Fried Soft-Shelled Crab Pakora, Shishito Peppers with Parmesan and Miso (amazing), and Pappardelle with goat, pork and veal sugo ... just to name a few of the great dishes we got that night. To top it off, the service was stellar. We had a great server named Marni - she was so helpful and attentive all throughout the busy Saturday night we came; she also suggested a great wine to go with the meal and explained every dish to perfection. I know with my 5-star review this is a bit redundant with all the other great reviews, but if you're in Chicago, you need to eat here!"
"Two stars because it just describes how I feel-- Meh. Â Glad I tried it, not planning on going back.So obviously, the food is very unique and the flavors are interesting. Â But I hate that you always have to make a reservation a million days in advance and even if you just want to eat at the bar, it takes forever. Â Also a bit more expensive that I'd like to pay for dinner.Id rather eat a meal that is comforting and satisfying and easily accessible (lol), rather than wait forever, and get an unusual and unfulfilling array of dishes."
"I really loved the experience at girl and goat. Â We loved the atmosphere and decor of restaurant. Â The drinks were delicious.the food was good, but I found some dishes delicious and others just ok.I will definitely be back!"
Shazam! This place is great top to bottom. We had a wonderful waitress and the best service. But the best part was that we tried 11 dishes and 10 of 11 exceeded expectations. We will be back here soon for sure.
"been twice and def a good vibe. Â sat at bar both times. Â bartenders so nice and helpful. Â food is uneven though. Â LOVE the sides--broccoli and cauliflower and the other veggies are just SO good. Â I wish they told you you could get half portions though. Â i guess if you put it on the menu maybe everyone would do it so i get that, but I was with my friend and we were traveling and expressed that we thought what we wanted would be too much and bartender didn't offer. Â wasn't until guy next to us, after we ordered, got his half-orders of veggies that we realized. Â then we asked and bartender said it was too late. Â hmm. Â just not good practice.entrees were a disappointment. one of the fish dishes was so fishy we didn't eat it fishiness was due to the type of fish, not prep, but server said it was a mild white fish when in fact it was more like a blue marlin--super strong fish taste!). Â she did take it off our bill but...next time i'd go for drinks and veggies only. Â always packed, which is actually fun, but i think a bit over-hyped."
"When visiting Chicago in July with family, we made it a point to stop by here to eat. I am so glad that we did! The menu is very unique and very delicious! We ordered the pig face, pork belly, and beet salad to name a few items. The staff was friendly and accommodating! Even though we sat at a community style table, it was large enough to still allow enough privacy for our party of four. Can't wait to visit Chicago again so we can eat here again!"
"This place is awesome! Â I took my girlfriend there for her birthday, it was perfect. Â I had to make reservations about 3 months ahead, but it was most definitely worth it. Â We had a variety of plates, but my favorite by far was the empanadas. Â They were amazing! Â We also had the pork shank which was great. Â If you are planning a trip to Chicago or love here...you have to go at least once."
"Did not have one 'bad' or even 'just ok' dish here, not one. Â Everything was phenomenal.Each item was decadent and spectacular in its own way. Â Most items were rich but always came with a pickled (onion, pepper) element to cut down on some of the richness.Not a place to come if you're watching your figure; this is a place to come and indulge.In case you're wondering, I had:corny goat breadroasted cauliflowerhiramasascallopscrispy pork facebeef tonguefudgesiclegoat cheese bavaroiseCan't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"
Great food and excellent service. Â Did not appreciate the push to order too much food all at once. Â Very allergy friendly.
"Unpretentious, Unique, Casual, Delicious... AMAZING.If you are an adventurous foodie and want a truly unique experience, then this place is IT! Â Seriously, I have never experienced anything like it. Â The combinations that Chef put together are truly a work of art.At first glance, and only looking at the ingredients of each dish, you would questions how/why anyone would combine such different food groups and tastes... but once you take that first bike, you'll know!Between my husband and myself we ordered 8 dishes (did I say we loved to eat) and didn't regret a single one!This place has charm, excellent service, and menu like no other!"
"Yum! Everything was so good..loved the green bean dish..Out waiter was very helpful in suggesting what to order.I would go back..and yes, it was worth the 3 month wait to make a RSVP. :)"
Wow Â what can i say once we sat at the bar Our night was awesome!!!Aside from a very Â rude male maitre de and sort of a yuppie crowd the night was awesome!The food i cant say anything about but freakin amazing !New American cuisine! Â funny thing is we went here not knowing that the girl that won top chief owns it ! Â ( she was there expediteing ) Everything on the menu was awesome ----- Â it's all plates to share.The cocktails were awesome too!Our bartender was awesome. Â She was so knowledgeable and sweet . Â . cant remember her name - do remember that she was a dancer.Amazing night!Make sure you make a Â reservation if you want a table Â or you could try to come sit at the bar !Should be 4 1/2 stars
"I went to college with Stephanie and that was the reason for the visit. But all bias aside, probably the best meal I had in Chicago that trip. She puts together flavors that I would never imagine but my palate loved! Everything on the menu was extremely unique and absolute deliciousness. Â I love the fact that all the items were served tapas style, so we got to try many different things. With each new item that arrived, we tried to pace ourselves because we knew something else would be arriving soon.Since we didn't have reservations, we sat at the bar and could not have been more pleased with our choice. Â Service was phenomenal. The bartenders were all extremely friendly and knowledgeable. Â Service was very quick, and even though the bar was packed, we did not feel like we were overlooked at any point in the evening.I think EVERYONE should check out this new gem in Chicago, truly a delightful dining experience."
"We went here without reservations since it's still pretty booked from all the hype. Â At 5:30pm on a Monday, we were seated right away at the communal table overlooking the kitchen. Â If you're into the celebrity aspect of this place, this is a great spot to sit since Stephanie stood at the counter the entire time we were there (I thought it was rather odd to see her micromanaging the ticket orders all night even though I really can't tell you what other role I would expect her to be playing). Â The menu items looked great...and that's where it ended. Â The problem we found was that, on paper, her ideas were incredibly delicious but once executed, the flavors didn't pop as we imagined they should have. Â The one exception to that was the hiramasa crudo. Â Unfortunately, the salads, softshell crab and lamb ribs didn't meet or exceed our expectations. Â All in all, it's a really nice space and decent food. Â However, like most restaurants in this west loop area, it just doesn't live up to it's praise. Â Or, maybe it's that there are several similar places in the city that do a better job of this type of cuisine at the moment. Â That being said, don't try this place if you've already eaten at Purple Pig. Â The bar will have been set too high."
"Went here for a dear friend's birthday. It should be pointed out that I am a vegetarian, so I did not partake in all of the offerings like the rest of the group did. I also didn't partake of the wine, so I can't comment on that, either. But I don't think, in 2011, that a restaurant should be based solely on its meat or wine. Often times, it's what you can do with the vegetable dishes that really makes it work.And it works nearly perfectly ... if you eat meat.- The chickpea fritters were fantastic. By far my favorite part of the menu, with the goat feta & hazelnut hummus. Delicious.- The cauliflower was a wonderful mix of flavors; not what one would expect from cauliflower (not my favorite veggie). With pine nuts? Forget it. & the mint gave a little pleasant surprise to the tastebuds.- The kabocha squash ravioli was also very tasty. The dish was full of mainly sauce, which was great, but but I would have liked a little more ravioli in my ravioli.- The shaved kohlrabi salad, I was tentative about because fennel was listed as an ingredient, & I loathe anything black licorice-tasting. It was cold & okay, but by far, probably the least ooohed & aaahed over at our table.The favorites at the table were a shank of some sort, a big bone of something that came with spoons instead of knives (for good reason), calamari, pig's face (I had to cover my human face when I saw them eating this - I can handle a lot, as a vegetarian with carnivorous dining partners, but I found this disgusting), some fish (again, with the eating of the face), & something else that everyone was passing around & nearly orgasming from.As far as desserts go, I could have done without the bourbon apples or whatever they were, but I'm not generally a fan of anything alcohol-soaked. The brownie with ice cream was typical. But the Snickers-like dessert was divine.Our server was beyond exceptional. She was awesome in explaining & taking care of my food restriction, careful to point out that I shouldn't eat one particular bread that was made with bacon fat, for example. And the rest of the staff was wonderful as well, especially since we stayed past closing (we are enthusiastic but slow eaters, loving to savor every bite, & big talkers).The ambiance was perfectly understated - blacks, woods, dim but not too dim warm lighting. I felt safe there, if that makes any sense.All that being said, I don't know if I'd be incredibly eager to go back (expensive for tapas & I suppose for good reason, meat-wise, but not veggie-wise - some of the ""V"" options were made with fish broth or other meat products, so that limited my already limited choices), but if I was invited & had a few bucks to throw down (on food, cabs, etc.), I'd accept. I know my friends certainly would; they loved it."
"This is a sweet new restaurant; while I'd love to be able to visit the place more times before logging a review, it's worth capturing some first impressions. Â The place was really hopping even after 9pm on a Monday night, with a good overall buzz from the excitement surrounding its opening. Â Definitely go online and make reservations.Its location on Randolph gives it that contemporary and somewhat dark warehouse vibe, which seems pretty right on for the inventiveness of the chef and playfulness of the food. Â The bar has some cool cast-iron like decorative accents, and you can see the staff hopping in back to turn out all of the small plates.The shared plates concept is always great, as you come to a place like this for the experience. Â It's fun to exchange notes without having to be that guy with his fork greedily stabbing morsels from your friend's plates across the table. Â No one plate is big enough for a meal, but I generally found it sufficient to really experience each dish between the two of us. Â The 3-part menu concept (V(eg), F(ish), M(eat)) worked well for me--but they're not strict categories; I think the main focus should be balancing out your meal like selecting a couple from each category, a la the ""food groups"" predecessor to the USDA pyramid.Service was quirky but enjoyable. Â The hostess at the lounge area, who we interacted with while waiting for our table (having shown up a little early), indicated she was out of my first beer choice -- only one of two beers on the pretty extensive menu that was out, which blows -- but she was definitely interested in helping me, and seeing me happy with my final selection. Â Ugh, the name of the beer escapes me, since my server at the table was able to recognize it (and bring me a second) only by its color, which I thought was a nice trick.Our server was bouncing off the walls with energy, but not in a sappy too-happy for reality kind of way. Â He no doubt had a spiel to get us started, but he had immediate answers to all of our questions, and I was never left wanting for his attention.The only disappointment with the evening was with the oysters, which were not raw, rather one of our selections was roasted (and accented with hard-cooked egg) and nestled into a bed of raw black beans, whereas the other was deep fried and set back into the shell. Â Both dishes possessed the taste of oyster, but I just didn't get into it as I was excited to experience the more textural aspects of sliding them out of the shell. Â Perhaps I'd have known had I studied this portion of the menu more closely.Items that thrilled me more were the fat bread, shaved kohlrabi (a german turnip) and the lamb with the pecan picatta. Â But the real standouts in our selection were the soft shell crab and crispy pig face with the sunny-side egg on top. Â Don't give it to much thought; just order it. Â The hostess assured me that all the desserts are great. Â I'll have to go back before I can describe the rich, smooth almost cheese-cake flavored bavarian cream, with slightly acidic berry accents and tiny explosions of salt and crunch (which frankly I thought were bacon but my taste buds were confused and provoked, in a good way).Looking back at my bill, I found this to be a better value than the Purple Pig, with a superior level of service and atmosphere."
"One creates one's own opportunity. The inability to get a reservation did not deter us. We visited Randolph Street Market with the intention being a walk in at The Girl and the Goat. We were extremely fortunate to get a table, they do save a few tables for walk-ins. My wife and I are big fans of Stephanie's, and we were not disappointed. Yes, as many other reviewers have noted it is loud. Yes, the menu us weighted toward pork and rich meats. If this is not what you are looking for, take your narrow mind and go some where else. My wife is a vegetarian and loved it. The service was stellar. Both Beca our waitress and all the bus staff we extremely attentive. The wine list, while small was very well balanced. They have a great selection of craft beers, and a diverse full bar a few nice signature cocktails My only regret was the we were not there with a larger group, so I could have tried more dishes. We will go back to try more of the the great mix of well prepared dishes. Without a doubt my favorite dish with ""pig face"". This wonder full dish is rich and flavorful. The tamarind sauce, sunny-side egg and fried onions made this dish to die for. The roasted cauliflower was wonderful. The wood roasted oysters with horseradish aoli was fabulous. I cannot wait to go back!"
"Delicious, the sweet potato ravioli and mushroom ragout was very good. The dessert was even better. It was definitely not what I expected, but still a good experience."
"It really lived up to the expectations! The confit goat belly with bourbon butter, lobster and crab, was one of the best dishes of my life! Everything we tried was amazing, with the exception of the salmon. They had it paired with eggplant and nectarine. Really weird. Not good. I have lots of food allergies, and they took the menu to the chef who crossed out everything I couldn't have. The only thing I'd say is that they shouldn't have a gluten free menu with soy sauce (which contains gluten). They say it contains trace amounts of gluten. Gluten free people can not have ANY gluten. So I felt the menu was really misleading. But they were so helpful and really tried hard to accommodate my needs. I can't wait to go back for the goat belly. AMAZING!!"
"Have been here twice and it gets better every time. Â This time was just dumb luck. Â We were walking in the area without a reservation and decided to go in hoping a couple of bar seats would be open. Â It was kind of early (around 5:00 on a Thursday) so we thought we may have a chance. Â We asked the hostess how long the wait would be. Â To our surprise she said she could seat us outside immediately or inside, but would have to be out by 7:30. Â We decided to sit inside.To our surprise, the table that was open was the chef's table overlooking the kitchen! Â What a great experience. Â Everyone was extremely friendly and fun to talk to. Â We learned so much about what goes on behind the scenes. Â I don't remember getting any extra dishes on our previous visit, but this time they served us two extra complimentary items. Â (Both of which were excellent.) If you've never been here, you definitely need to go. Â No matter what you pick, you can't go wrong. Â (The grilled baby octopus is my favorite though.)"
"Overall: Pricey as expected, flavorful exquisite food, excellent attentive service, great atmosphere.My girlfriend and I went to the Girl & the Goat last night without a reservation because I had called 3 weeks ago and they couldn't give me a reservation for two. Luckily, at 9:30 pm they were able to seat us in 10 minutes and it was only 4 blocks from work it worked out well.They're described as contemporary American and that's definitely accurate, looking at the menu made me feel a little lost but we ended up ordering 6 dishes to share. We had amazing chickpea fritters, oysters, goat empanadas with masala and yogurt (a favorite), scallops which were perfectly cooked but I thought there was too much going on in the dish, sugo (the only really filling dish), and the pig face. The flavors were often unique and intense, everything was rather enjoyable. Â We finished the night off with pork fat fried doughnuts with blackberries and vanilla gelato. The doughnuts were excellent and the dessert met my high standards, even without having chocolate.Our waitress seemed rather knowledgable and was kind of outgoing and funny. Usually our waiters get awkward around us or make things uncomfortable since we scream couple (looking into each others eyes, constantly holding hands, feeding each other), but she handled it well and even teased us a little, calling us love-birds. The plates came out one at a time, almost right after we had finished the last one (we slowed down at the end).In the end it was what I expected, but better: the restaurant looked great, it was super busy but we managed to be seated, pricey but didn't do as much damage as I thought, and excellent, flavorful food in small but reasonable portions."
"wow, incredible tastes, service, environment (if loud ok). Â Open kitchen concept so you can see the chefs and how clean the place is. Â Unique items throughout the menu, all very tasty (we tried many, not disappointed with any). Â Gets very busy, reservations a must"
"Who knew that putting a girl together with a goat could make such magic?!?! I've been here twice now and both experiences were top notch. I first went in the summer a few weeks after they opened and I just went back last week for my birthday. I love how there were several different items and ingredients on the menu now for Fall that were not on the Summer menu. Seasonal menus are great because they keep the menu fresh and new and you keep wanting to come back and try the new stuff! For this visit, there were four of us and we were seated promptly at our reservation time (make your reservation at least 4 weeks in advance, the place is swamped). The only downside of the place is that the high ceilings and large, open dining room make for a pretty noisy meal! It was a little hard to have a conversation with my companions. Other than that though, service and food are spectacular! Since it is all sharable plates and the menu is split up between Vegetables, Fish, and Meat, we decided to try 3 items from each. We also started with one of the creative daily breads....a chocolate pumpkin bread. From the veggies we had the roasted cauliflower, chickpeas fritters, and the squash ravioli....all were excellent, with the standout being the cauliflower. I'm not a huge cauliflower fan, but the way it is cooked makes it so scrumptious, I would eat it everyday if I could! From the fish we had the seared scallops, the sauteed shrimp, and the fish....both the scallops and shrimp were my favorite dishes. Chef Izard really knows how to create interesting, fresh flavors. From the meat we had the goat pizza (great smoky flavor to the goat), the pig face (very rich), the skirt steak, and we just had to throw in the ham frites at the last minute (very addicting, but a little over salted). The only complaint on this was the skirt steak portion was very skimpy. Every other dish had a good amount to split between the 4 of us, but the skirt steak was barely enough for 2! So, we ended up ordering 10 plates total plus the bread, which actually ended up being too much....we were stuffed! 8 plates for the 4 of us probably would have been perfect. Since it was my birthday, I had to stuff a dessert into my stomach also! And, the server already knew that it was my birthday without having to say anything (there was a note made of it on the Open Table reservation). So, she also asked if I would like to meet Chef Izard, which was a wonderful surprise! I was able to meet her up by the kitchen and chat for a minute. Overall, Girl and the Goat is a can't miss Chicago restaurant that I will definitely be going back to for hopefully many years to come!"
"I don't get IT. Â So disappointing!!! Â Greasy, salty and room temperature. Â We cannot recommend"
"Absolutely worth the wait for a table or reservation. The food is amazing, the decor is perfect and the service was great. Every member of the staff was friendly and low-key, without any of the attitude you might expect for such a popular place. Â The menu is varied and has plenty for everyone, from your most hard-core meat eaters to crunchy granola vegetarians. We ordered 3 dishes each with bread and had plenty of leftovers. Probably overdid it a bit, but oh wells. The wine list was good, the beer list was great. And the oak aged Manhattan was spectacular. Can't wait to go back... in like 8-12 weeks."
Outstanding food and good cocktails.
"My husband and I finally got a chance to try Girl and goat after a really long wait (6 months). He surprised me to G&G dinner on my birthday. The food was delicious and so was the experience. This place is best for parties and hanging out with large crowds; not suitable for romantic dates. My favorite dish was the chicken, chickpea fritters and other veggie dishes. Even though veggie options are limited, the ones that are available are amazing. Definitely worth a try! Make sure you make the reservation months in advance. My husband made reservation 4 months in advance Â for my birthday. How cute right :)"
"Probably the best gastro-pub food in the city. Although the pig face was very good, I probably wouldn't order it again. The lupe de mer w/ tempura broccoli was incredible, though. Will definitely go back, but I'm not sure 3 months for reservations is worth that much hype. Service was really good, though. I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars."
all they hype is worth it. This restaurant is great and worth the wait to get in.
"Food n beer selection was great. Price was a bit high, but typical for this type of restaurant. Tapas style dinning. Must try the lamb tartar."
"Awesome, unusual food and a great space."
"My buddy got a hall pass from his wife and came down from the suburbs to overnight in the city so I got a room at the Park Hyatt and was having a few drinks at a bar down the street. He really wanted to try out something new so we asked the concierge where we should go and he said Girl and the Goat. So we were driven in the hotel car in style to the restaurant. Needless to say, it was Friday night at 9.30pm when we got there and the place was packed. With no reservations, we had to wait 45 mins but wow it was worth the wait. Danielle (our server) was awesome. We let her do the ordering and also chose a bottle of wine for us. Dish by dish they came, and to say that we were ravages were an understatement. The flavors, taste and quality ingredients were outstanding and the service was also very good. Simple dishes like green beans were amazing. Our favorites were definitely the pork liver mussolini, and the pork belly. It was reasonably priced and Stephanie Izard came to talk to us after our meal. Throughly enjoyed it and would definitely come back again."
"Last night my fiance and I went to Girl and the Goat. Â We were extremely excited because of all the wonderful things that have been said and all the glowing reviews on Yelp!We had reservations and were sat probably 5 minutes after said reservation. Â It took about 4-5 minutes before our waiter came over and apologized for the wait, but we understood...it was really really busy. Â The Wine: Â We decided to go with a Pinot Noir because we figured that would pair well with many different dishes. Â The waiter pointed one out that he said was great and before we could really say yes or no to his choice he said ""I'll put that order in."" Â Luckily the wine was good and so was the price point...or I would have been annoyed.The Food: Â Obviously we went family style and shared everything (as you are supposed to do). Â We started with some awesome freshly made bread and liver butter. Â That was very good. Â The liver butter was savory and had a very light liver flavor.Then we ordered the beet salad and the green beans. Â The waiter didn't point out that beet salad had a lot of green beans in it and had we known that we wouldn't have ordered the other order of green beans, or we would have waited and ordered it at a later point in our meal. Â The beet salad was good, but I thought the creme fresh overpowered the other flavors. Â However, it had a lot of depth with the beets and the anchovies and the beans, and then there were these crunchies on top and they added great texture.The green beans were very underwhelming. Â We started eating them and they were ok. Â Towards the end of the dish we discovered that the flavor grew on us, but they were mediocre at best.Next, we ordered the steamed clams and the ham frites. Â The waiter told us to order them together so we could dip the frites in the fennel broth from the clams. Â The clams were really good. Â The broth was delicious and the flavor combination of the sausage, fennel and clam worked well together. Â The frites sounded really good, but IMHO were just expensive french fries. Â Once we were finished with those two dishes we waited and waited and waited and waited some more until finally our waiter came back around. Â That was really annoying.Our last 2 dishes were the crisp skate and the crispy pig face. Â I wasn't planning on eating much of the pig face, that was more for him. Â The skate was probably the only item that we ordered that we both said ""WOW!"" Â It was really delicious. Â The combination of the crispy skate, calamarie, chickpeas, tomatoes, radicchio...it was great! Â Just great. Â Would definitely order that if we went back. Â The crispy pig face on the other hand was not good. Â He didn't even want to finish it. Â All it tasted like was deep fried nothingness. Â The only saving grace was the arugula salad on top. Â Overall, a very underwhelming experience. Â Maybe we ordered the wrong things, maybe it was an off night, maybe we are too picky....but maybe it just isn't worth 5 stars. Â I'm not saying I'll never be back, but I'll definitely say that there are other restaurants in the city that I'd rather spend my money at.*****I wrote this review the day after we went and my fiance is suffering from what we think is food poisoning. Â  Eeeeek."
"Incrdible! I will remember this meal for a long time! I am not a huge fan of meat, just picky about it. Kept an open mind, tried everything from green beans to pig face and I can't say enough about how good everything was. Didn't read any of the reviews before going, wanted to be open and not get what everyone recommended and was thrilled.Go, go go, you won't be sorry!"
"On a recent trip to Chicago, some friends took us to the Girl and the Goat, a very happening establishment near our downtown hotel. I had high hopes after reading the very positive Yelp and Urbanspoon reviews.We ordered as a table, and split most items. I do give the restaurant credit for thinking outside the box when it comes to their menu, but ultimately the only item I cared for was the masala pizza. Everything else was at best okay, but still carried hefty price tags. On a positive note, their selection of draft beer was excellent. No... me thinks I shant return."
"My awesome BF surprised me with dinner here last night. Â Being a huge fan of Top Chef, Stephanie Izzard was my fav top chef winner and I have been wanting to come here ever since I have heard that Stephanie was opening a restaurant here in Chicago. Â Since I was not expecting that we were coming here, (my BF had told me a week ago that he was taking me somewhere but since it takes about three months to get a reservation here I did not expect that we would be coming here. Â Turns out he made reservations in October) I was so shell shocked, I could barely answer when the hostess asked us if we wanted to check in our coats. Â We got there at 6:40, my BF reservations were at 6:45. Â We got a drink at the bar and were promptly seated. Â I was still in shock so I spent those five minutes willing my brain to realize we were actually at the Girl and the Goat! Â On our way to our table, the hostess wished us a great dinner which I thought was nice. Â (I was still too busy smilling like an idiot since I was amazed we were here!)Here is what we ordered:Lamb sausage stuffed calamari - interesting take on this dish, I thought it was pretty good, the lamb felt a little try but ground lamb does tends to be a little on the dry side. Â I thought it was delicious still!Escargo meatballs - My BF loved this dish. Â I agree as well. Â The meatballs are so flavorful. Â I couldn't really taste the escargo but I could have eaten just the meatballs for dinner. Â Plus the meatballs came with these chinese long greenbeans that I love!Goat liver mousse - I wanted to get something with goat since we were at the Girl and the Goat and figured this would be an interesting dish to try. Â The waiter also mentioned that the crumpets that came with this dish were homemade and I am a sucker for homemade bread! Â The goat liver was creamier than the usual pate texture and it tasted more like sausage than liver so I thought it was pretty amazing. Â Plus it came with little pickled sides that were pretty tasty.Pig face - I was really expecting this to come...well more face like, but I overheard the waiter telling the table next to us that it is more like a headcheese and it is all grinded up together, cut up into patties and fried. Â It came with a fried egg on top, and the combination of the egg yolk and crispy pork...I mean you can't go wrong right?For dessert, we ordered the blood orange sorbet. Â I am not usually a sorbet girl, but the combination of flavors in this dish, the orange sorbet with pistachio cake and crunchy savory parsnip crisps, along with this vanilla like custard pudding went shockingly well together!I was so happy that the G&G did not disappoint. Â When I watch Top Chef, sometimes I wonder how those dishes would taste since they always use the most interesting ingredients and weird combinations. Â I always think to myself, would that taste good? Â With the G&G I feel like all of the dishes sounded so interesting and had things I would never have thought would have gone together, but the textures and flavors all come together to make some pretty amazing dishes. Â I also really love the decor of the G&G. Â It is a huge loft space, but still manages to feel homey. Â It was a lot bigger than I expected and I like that they tried to make as much seating space as possible, yet the place still looks super nice. Â Service at the G&G is attentive but not overwhelming, prompt and not pushy, so it is the perfect balance. Â I can't wait to have another visit so I can try more of the G&G dishes offered here, they all sound so interesting, it was so hard to just pick four dishes!"
"Great job for a Great Chef -Stephanie Izard witha strong restaurant group behind her -BOKA .If there was any more buzz about the Girl and the Goat, it might as well be a bee. Make reservations. And still expect a wait.Overbooking it is a problem for a lot of new restaurants because the high rate of cancelation. Ours was 30 minutes, which we spent by the bar. There's a decent cocktail menu with nothing too fancy. Quickly, the service is quick but surprisingly unchatty, and you'll get multiple waiters bringing you your food. They take the time to explain the dish, which is nice. The decor makes the place extremely loud. And the complaints about the salt are perfectly valid; some of the dishes had too much of it.Overall, a very fantastic evening that left just a smidge to be desired.Our food menu:Corny Goat Cheese Mousse: very delicious, and the goat cheese was very subdued. Came with an awesome corn relish.Pan Fried Shishito Peppers: I thought this dish was fantastic, although every fourth pepper or so is overtly hot. The peppers are Parmesan crusted-ish, which is awesome.Chickpea Fritters: Another solid use of the fried with the vegetable. Perfectly complemented by the sourness of the tomatoes.Roasted Cauliflower: My favorite dish. Amazingly seasoned; the menu says pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. I'm not sure if it actually tastes like it sounds, but it tastes fantastic.Seared Flounder: My favorite fish dish. Light and refreshing, almost like a sashimi dish from a trendy sushi place like Uchi in Austin.Sauteed Skate: Good combination of ingredients, but the salt is clearly evident.Hiramasa Crudo: Nice enough to put the crispy pork belly on the side to accommodate the non-pork eaters. The dish came with caperberries, although I'm still not sure what caperberries taste like.Pan Roasted Chicken: Way too salty. The chicken itself tasted great, but was smothered in a salt sauce with a side of black bean. The watermelon doesn't add anything to dishes like these; I'm not sure why that's a growing trend in fancy restaurants.I can't seem to find the dessert menu online to remember what we got, only I remember they're not good. The dessert dishes are a blend of sweet and salty, and that's not a combination that's up my alley. I took a bite of each and passed.Overall, With Marche ant The Grocery Bistro gone they have a lot of room on the Randolph Street.It's trendy, it's popular, it's saltily delicious. But it feels a little too much of each. Combined with the longer than expected wait (no free appetizer or drink comp at least?), and it doesn't quick reach the 5* mark."
"Hands down the best dining experience in the past year. We waited 2 hours for our table - seated at 11:30PM. We tried a total of 16 dishes. All were fantastic. I recommend having the server plan your meal for you. They do a great job of selecting some stand out dishes , pairings, etc. The green beans and pig face were fantastic. I can't remember the others. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT!"
"You're going to have to wait to sit down. You will want to plan in advance if prime-time reservations are needed. Once you've eaten at this place, you'll understand why. Everything you will eat here will not taste like anything you have ever eaten before. If you don't know, everything on the menu are small plates to share with your dining guests - you might even share a table with other parties. My favorite item on the menu were the ravioli along with the deep-fried oysters. Overall, its hard to find a better-place this contemporary while maintaining its foodie integrity."
"I want to live here...not because of the food, well not only because of the food. I just really love the design and ambiance. The style is somewhere between warehouse, pub, and victorian train station. The staff is awesome, very friendly, knowledgable, and laid back.Only ordered one meat dish, but the vegetarian dishes we had were awesome. The favorite of the night was actually quite simple, but one of the best balanced dishes I've had: shaved kohlrabi, mixed greens, blueberries, shaved almonds in a light cream dressing. Brilliantly executed.The shishito peppers where quite tasty, but honestly a bit overkill to get a whole bowl of them for only two people; never had that many in a single order before. The roasted cauliflower was nicely balanced between savory, salt, and naturally sweet.The pretzel bread was too dry and the tomato-vanilla bean soup was only ok and kind of boring.The goat pizza was good and given that I'm a vegetarian who has never eaten goat, but always heard how gamey it is I was rather impressed.Can't wait to go again!"
"After having followed Stephanie Izzard through her Top Chef championship, and reading the articles and buzz leading up to the restaurant opening, we found ourselves last night at Girl and the Goat, taking in the fun, rustic dÃ©cor, and smelling that delicious wood-fire oven.Brennan, our waiter was fun and friendly. Â So friendly and relaxed in fact, I had a moment when I thought, oh no, this person knows me, and I have no idea what his name is!?! Â Then I realized he was just a very friendly waiter. Whew! Â He explained the small plates concept, and recommended 2 - 3 dishes each for a full meal.The Scallops and the orange sorbet dessert were my favorites. Â Didn't really like the green beans (and I usually love my vegetables)Oh, and it was cool seeing Stephanie Izzard working the kitchen while we were eating out meal. Â We'll be making another reservation soon!"
"Brand new restaurant!Shared Tables, Napkins and water glasses seem to be a direct ripoff of the Publican, but I'll let it slide.Met a new friend here, Brad C., who was sitting at the table next to me, and we talked restaurants the whole meal, he shared with us and we shared with him, which I believe conveys the spirit of Girl and the Goat.I had pretty much everything and my favorites were the soft shell crab, the lamb ribs and the fudgesicle dessert.The energy in the room is comfortable, but not as much as its automatic comparison of The Publican.But food wise, I would actually say it was better and more exciting then The Purple Pig.This was its first week of being open so I am excited to watch this restaurant grow, and am not about to judge on service.... although the servers were a bit too controlling, not putting faith into its diners into knowing what to order or where to go, and then persisting that they know what is right and you don't. *sigh* Â Don't you just hate that? :)Overall, this was a positive experience, and again, I am excited to watch this place grow, and I most likely will be back.Thanks to Brad C. for the sharing. sharing IS caring.and, thanks to Colleen C. for checking in here and reminding me that I wanted to go here."
"Went here with my husband a few months ago (just getting around to the review now) and it was fantastic! Â We went on a Sunday and it was still packed. Â Our waitress was the best - so friendly and helpful in terms of telling us how much to order, and making sure we chose a good variety of flavors. Â The ham frites, which we probably would not have ordered if not for the server's suggestion, were SOOOO yummy. Â Loved the decor and overall atmosphere as well."
"This place is incredible, no doubt about it! We made reservations 2 months in advance and it was well worth the wait! The place is very dark and trendy and the wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. Since this type of dinner is considered ""tapas"" they advise you to get 2-3 dishes per person. My husband and I got a total of 6 dishes, 5 entrees and 1 dessert. We ordered the diver scallops, chickpea fritters, roasted pig face (dont let the name scare you, its incredible), braised short ribs, goat empanada and zucchini cake! This is a pricey restaurant but once you take your first bite, you forget about that minor detail because it's so incredible."
"I went for the first time Wednesday, and I had to wait four months for a reservation. We came early for our reservation to take a look around and to see what all the hype was about, and we were glad we waited 4 months! The decor and ambiance was fantastic! The hosts were very attentive and showed us to our table right at our reservation time and our server greeted us immediately. Our server was amazing! She was helpful, approachable, and took good care of us. She offered her opinion and explained the menu really well. The overall service was fantastic. They were fast and on top of everything. After arriving we were seated promptly and our server told us a little bit about the menu. The menu is divided into 3 sections: meat, fish, and vegetables. They also have a goat menu. She informed us that to have the best dining experience we should order 5-6 dishes for a party of 2. Before coming to the restaurant I looked at some yelp reviews to get a better idea of what to get. We looked over the menu and decided on the escargot ravioli, chickpea fritters, green beans, goat belly, and pig face. The pig face, goat belly, and chickpea fritters were delicious! The flavors were well balanced and just incredible. We decided on 2 desserts as well, the bittersweet chocolate cake and the pumpkin gelato. The chickpea fritters had great texture and the sauce was divine! We were a little skeptical on the pig face, but wow, that was by far my favorite dish of the night. The crispy pork, the egg, the sauces, everything about it was amazing and I'd go back just for that. I hate to write negative comments but the green beans and escargot ravioli was not the best. The ravioli was a little bland and nothing special. Being my first time trying escargot, I was put off by the fact that I was eating snail. The green beans were really salty and had way too much vinegar. With green beans being so light and a fresh ingredient the use of the fish sauce wasn't necessary, and it was overpowering. The bittersweet chocolate cake was wonderful. The shiitake sauce that came with it was not that great. While reading the reviews I saw a comment that one of the desserts tasted like skunk and they didn't state which one. Well after trying the sauce I knew they were talking about that one. It was bad. We tried to eat around the sauce but in the end we couldn't finish it. The pumpkin gelato was a little bland and could have been better. The sauce was a little spicy and didn't taste right. The food, service, and overall restaurant were excellent. I would definitely go back and try what other creative dishes they have!"
"Complete experience, start to finish. Â Proud to admit that I'm a Top Chef fan, and the hostess picked up on it. Â Got a signed menu from Stephanie!Seriously though, atmosphere was great. Â Both our waiter and the sommelier were phenomenal. Â Stuffed myself, got two decent bottles of wine, and shared 4 desserts with 5 people, and left for $50, pre-tip. Â In summary, accesible gourmet."
Words of advice for an amazing meal:Come hungry.Get the chickpea fritters.Best experience is to dine with a group of people to really sample the menu.Enjoy. You can't go wrong here. Trust.
"There's nothing that hasn't been said. Went with a group of four (which I think is probably the ideal size). Made the reservation over 2 months in advance and could only get a table at 4:50 pm so that was a little awkward.The food was excellent. We ended up starting off with one of the sweet breads and oysters before moving into the main small plates. Ordered:Roasted cauliflowerGrilled baby octopusLamb Â sausage stuffed calamariGrilled halibutGoat Liver mousselineGrilled pork ribsBraised beef tonguePork BellyThe cauliflower was a surprise hit and next time I go, I will be inclined to try more of the veggies. Everything else was great, the goat liver mousse was probably the unfortunate downfall overall. Don't worry, we got dessert too. Bittersweet chocolate cake with gelato, pork fat donuts with pineapple, and the goat cheese trio. Surprisingly, we were all satisfied, but not stuffed for all the food we consumed. Â We also all got drinks. I got a mixed drink, don't remember the name, but it was good, the drink menu as a whole looked good. For all the food and drinks we got the bill came out to be about 240 total. Which is not cheap by any means, but for the amount and caliber of food we got, I feel that the price was not actually that terrible. We also did see the Top Chef working the line all night, kinda cool to see her actually back in the kitchen. I would highly recommend. Just make the reservation way in advance. Also of note, as mentioned before I was in a group of four and I really think our group size actually made the meal more enjoyable. The dishes are made to be consumed in fours, so that's helpful, but additionally, it was nice to be in a small group and almost discuss what we were eating as we went along. I could see a big group turning into a disaster of people passing dishes all around and some people wanting to to get certain things and others not. Just a thought."
"Everything here is delicious. Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything that you order. My server was great and attentive without being overly pushy.The only negative side is how crowded it is -- take it from one disgruntled lezzy, DON'T SIT AT THE BAR! Lots of drunk, divorced men trying to buy you drinks, it's distracting and takes away from the excellent food. Make a reservation, it's worth it."
"I went to Girl and the Goat last night as part of a group of eight. First off, the ambiance is awesome. It was modern and rustic at the same time, my favorite. We had reservations and they were a little late in seating us, but were completely apologetic about it. I didn't care because I was sipping on a delicious Tempest, which looks like a Mai Tai but is not girly at all. Their mixologist knows what he's doing.Our waiter had a wonderfully dry sense of humor (anyone who talks about wine, cat urine, and grass in the same breath is a friend of mine), and helped us pick out very reasonably priced bottles of wine ($30-$35) and didn't even try to push for the more expensive stuff. Now - the food. Since our party was big and they do small plates, we tasted practically everything on the menu. I would recommend the following to anyone: green beans, beet salad, seared scallops, and the lamb ribs. Veal sausage was my least favorite. Make sure you get some bread, too - the fat bread and the carrot bread were table favs. The price is right too - our party of 8 walked out of there with a final bill of $500 - and that includes tip, people!Most impressive of all is that Exec Chef Stephanie was checking every plate as it went out - while juggling requests for photos from customers. All the while she had a smile on her face.My only complaint is that I tasted so many delicious things that it was like flavor schizophrenia in my mouth. But I guess crazy is good sometimes!"
"Arg...I really wanted to like this place, but sadly left feeling underwhelmed and broke. If the food was amazing, I'd say money well spent, but I just couldn't say I had that experience. I respect Stephanie Izzard's desire to create new flavor combinations, but it was really hit or miss, with more misses unfortunately.Here's what I had:bread with goat cheese and corn - Came out hot and steaming. Good texture and flavorcrudo - Tasty. beets - Weird mix of beets, anchovies, frise', and beans. Not enough beets and the fish added an odd flavor componentfat back - Essentially lard you spread on a biscuit. The biscuits were flavorless and I gotta say I kind of felt gross after a few bites. Just not that into this dish concept...soft shell crab - I agree with other's that this was the highlight of the evening. It was the one dish I could say I would order again and be happy eating. A bit on the salty side.pig face - Mealy texture enhanced by overcooked egg on top. I couldn't take more than one bite. rabbit - The most disappointing dish. Turned out to be more like a rabbit taquito. Normally I expect rabbit to melt in my mouth, but it was so lost in this wrap that I felt like I was eating those Trader Joe's frozen chicken tacos.On top of this, we ordered what we thought was a $38 bottle of wine, but turned out to be $44 (which considering the total bill of $157, I guess it's not a huge deal, but still...)."
"Hate to be a party pooper but was not impressed with this place. Not sure what the hype is all about?!The food is extremely salty and they cant change / alter any item . There was a person in my party that could not eat salt and the kitchen could not (or maybe would not) accomodate our request for low sodium plates so therefore he went without eating (even the SALADS were salty).The staff while nice, really could not handle the no-salt request Â therefore gets a big thumb down from me. Even the wine list was really unimpressive. They made a point of saying how they pick obscure wines - well that is all fine, but at least pick good ones!!!!The best thing in this place is the decor. You can tell they paid a lot of attention to detail in the design aspect (maybe too much and forgot about the food??). Having said that, because of the way it was designed, it can get pretty loud there!Anyway, maybe I went on a bad night so will try to check it out one more time and may revise my review then!"
"The food was delicious. Green beans with fish sauce vinegarette, hirmasa crudo.Neighboring table got the goat leg which was impressive. Service was slow, which was fine. The Girl and the Goat label white wine was perfect. You will probably leave smelling like smoke due to the open kitchen and wood burning stove."
"How can one pretend to be a foodie living in Chicago without eating at Girl & the Goat?How we got a seat: The day I went, I had just finished an 8 hr exam, and we hopped in a cab and raced to the restaurant without a reservation. We hoped to prowl the bar for seats, as recommended by yelp reviewers. By the time I changed out of my sweatpants in the bathroom, we had a table for two. Even though it was right behind the hostesses, the fact we had NO wait for an actual table was amazing. So my advice is, go early (5pm or earlier) on a weekday to beat the post-work rush. Ambience: The place was more ""industrial"" than I'd imagined, but I like how it opened up to the street. The crowd was quite chatty, especially as the night went on and the number of people prowling the bar increased.Drinks: This is how they getcha! I loved my mixed drink, I think it had whiskey and cucumber of some kind. We then had wine pairings for every course basically. Food: We ended up ordering 7 small dishes: highlights were stuffed squash blossoms, octopus, scallops. Despite the palce's namesake, I was not a huge fan of the goat dish we ordered. (on a side note, even Girl+Goat cannot salvage soft shell crab..which always sounds better in theory than in actuality because it is always tasteless, crunchy and dry.) Nonetheless, I love how vegetables and other things were incorporated into the entrees. You wanted to every last sprig on the plate.Service: Our waitress was very knowledgeable and friendly, and recommended excellent wine pairings for our entrees. Nutshell: I did not have a desire to put salt on anything we ordered which is amazing to me. Obviously a must-go-to-at-least-once for anyone in the midwest or passing through!"
Awesome loft space. Â The exposed brick and timber makes it hip and urban. Â Great music. Â Edward Sharpe and The Magnetic Zeroes followed by Smashing pumpkins followed by Run DMC. My favorite thing about G&tG other than the braised beef tongue- is that you are at an amazing fine dining experience in an uber casual setting.
Lived up to my exceptions. All the food were delicious. Great drinks. But reservation is a must.
"At the risk of being labeled hip and cool, we dined here.We actually had a taste for a big juicy burger but Grange Hall is closed on Mondays so as we are trying to decide where to go we pass G&G. Â The place was busy and it was only 6:30 but I thought lets take a chance and see if we can get in, and yes I was sober when I had that thought. Â When I enquired the Hostess started with a canned speech about it being an hour to an hour and a half wait but we could have a seat at the bar...all of a sudden a manager appeared and asked if my party was all present and explained he needed the table back by 8pm for his later reservations. Â Damn we're in with no 3 week wait for a reservation!As far as the menu, read the other rave reviews, we were pleased with every thing we ordered and we thought the pricing was reasonable. Â Service was pleasant and when asked she could explain in detail any item on the menu, and I liked the feel of the place. Â Dark but you could still read the menu, loud but you could still have a conversation, a very comfortable vibe going on here. Â I will recommend and return."
"My wife and I went to GATG before a bulls game and left feeling like it was just so-so. There were certainly some highlights (the mussels were great and had some amazing croutons in them, the porkface was nice, and the pork shank was great), but also some lowlights (the style of the place was annoying, the reservation system, communal seating at the bar). We showed up right at opening time, but rather than sitting at our own table and enjoying our meal had to sit at a communal bar with some annoying couple from Champaign talking about how they saw the chef on tv and eavedropping on our conversation. The food was good, but not great. The atmosphere was cramped and hectic (which is weird for 5pm). Not a huge fan, but would probably give it another shot if we had a reservation."
"We loved it!!! I got lucky and was looking at 3 months out for a weekend reservation...somehow a 5:30 Friday (looking 2 days ago) opened up! Service is impeccable from hosts/hostesses, server, bussers etc. Â food is incredible- second time here and got the green beans (must have!) and the goat empanadas. Tried a pork (shoulder?) amazing- meat just fell off the bone, and a unique zucchini bread. My husband and I were both in love and we will definitely be back. Â Also, for a restaurant with a 3 month wait and such good reviews, I would say its reasonably priced!"
"I took my girlfriend to Girl and The Goat based on the reviews on Yelp and this restaurant surpassed every expectation. The decor and the ambiance were outstanding, and a glowing review about the food just wouldn't do it justice. The plates are perfect for sharing and the staff does an excellent job with the timing and the wine pairings. This was just a wonderful evening and I'm looking forward to my next visit."
"Ham Frites.Need I say more? For those who have never indulged in said frites, I probably should expand on the above statement. By ""expand"", I mean to tell you that this was by FAR the best plate of the night for me - crispy skinny fries sprinkled with bits of fried, salty ham, dipped in a tomato aioli or cheddar sauce. Thank YOU Stephanie Izard, for taking plain old fries to a Â whole new level.Luckily for my tablemates (because I pretty much hogged the fries), there were a number of other excellent choices for the night as well. My top faves included the Choco-lantern bread (hearty, pumpkin-y goodness), seared scallops (again, with more pumpkin, along with tarragon, fried brussel sprouts and pomegranate), Â and the chickpea fritters. Our waiter, I believe his name was Tony, highly recommended the roasted cauliflower, but when it comes down to vegetables or dessert...well, a gal has to have priorities.As you may have already guessed, we did opt for the dessert - a shared sticky date cake, which was delicious (though not amazing). Two thumbs up to G&TG's beer list - though on the pricey side, they did have some hard to find microbrews - (Dragon's Milk!!), and a new favorite of mine, the Golden Monkey Triple. The main reason I didn't give this place five stars, was the fact that it was SO unbearably crowded. Which I know is to be expected, but it was a bit annoying all the same (tripping over people everywhere you turn = unfun). The service was stellar, and I sense once this place isn't so ""IT"" with everyone in the city of Chicago trying to squeeze into one small space, it will be a great spot for a night out."
"This place really doesn't need any more rave reviews, it is hard enough to get a reservation, but this place is my favorite restaurant in Chicago! I have been lucky enough to have gone here 4 times, and it really is the best. The atmosphere is lively and fun, and the food is ALWAYS delicious. My favorite items are always the vegetables (Green beans, cauliflower, kohlrabi salad... YUM!). It is very reasonably priced for the quality of food and service is always great. make your reservation now and count down the days (or months) before one of the best meals of your life!"
It was good... I had high expectations due to its 4 1/2 star rating after 1600+ reviews on yelp. Â My family has also eaten here and raved about it. Â I was a bit disappointed.Don't get me wrong. Â The service was great. Â The people sitting around us were interesting and friendly. Â The Kohlrabi salad Â and goat empanadas = orgasmic. Â Goat tenderloin and squash blossom rangoon were delicious. Â The grilled baby squid was goodish (tasted a bit burnt to me). Â The roasted cauliflower was a miss. Â Alot of people like it but not I. Â My father uses the same recipe and his cauliflower is way better. Â  Â  The peach and sweet corn dessert was mind bendingly good. Â Popcorn (or kettlecorn?) in a gelato and peach dessert - GENIUS!!!!
"I didn't think Girl & the Goat could possibly live up to the buzz surrounding it but I really could find fault with nothing we experienced there. We went for a pretty early dinner but they were already packed at 5:30. Pleasantly and promptly, the hostess seated us and the great service just continued from there. Our waitress was the perfect mix of professional and friendly and the food was outstanding. I won't recommend specific dishes because I don't think you can go wrong and there were several I'd have liked to try but will have to wait till next time. Food is served ""small plates"" style and we probably shared about six items. This is great at a restaurant like this because there are so many great dishes. All of the above came at what I felt was a reasonable price, particularly for the downtown Chicago address. You may need to make a res now to get in before the holidays though as they are justifiably booked solid for about three months."
"PIG FACE!I could say more (about how the service was good, all the food excellent...) but why?Also, a little hint, they will serve you at the couches up front if you don't have a reservation."
"Girl & the Goat has the complete package: Â rustic chic decor, upscale casual atmosphere, excellent customer service, nice cocktails ($11-$13), imaginative food. Reservations for prime dinner hours should be made weeks in advance. If you're going as a party of one or two, you must request the kitchen table. You sit in front of the grill and saute station and can watch the plates as they're cooked/plated/expedited. Throughout dinner, we socialized with the chefs which was really enjoyable. Tonight's favorites: Â homemade BREAD with sweet onion butter and herb oil ($4); SEARED SCALLOPS with pumpkin brandade, pecans, fried brussels sprouts, tarragon, pomegranate gastrique ($16); GOAT BELLY topped with a stone crab claw, fennel, vanilla bourbon butter ($21); HAMACHI CRUDO with crisp pork belly, aji aioli, caperberries ($14); BEEF TONGUE with masa, beef vinaigrette, salsa verde ($12). Izard's food is creative, busy, and rich. Although there's a lot going on in each plate, it really works. Desserts were delectable and unique (e.g., shiitake gelato, maple fat gelato, etc), however, the house made bread and savory plates are the highlights at Girl & the Goat. My friend and I had 2 cocktails each, and we shared 8 plates. (They suggest 2-3 plates per person). Total came to $165 pre-tip. Can't wait to return!"
"So even though g&g was one of the best food adventures I have had in the city, I am weighting this score due to the hype and expectation factor. So in comparison to the taqueria I gave 5 stars to, this is definitely better quality, better service, blah blah, but due to the buzz and high expectations of g&g, I give it 3.5 stars, but rounded it to 4. Although explained as a ""small plates"" dining experience, I found that the plates were not really small enough to be considered this. The waiter did recommend 2 plates per person, but because how the menu is designed, it essentially ends up as a large regular meal being a main dish (like a steak) with a side (maybe a salad or some green beans?). I would like it if the plates were a bit smaller, with the option of getting more choices. There are tons (maybe about 9 choices each) of veggie, fish, meat, and 'specials' options to choose from, and then you are only limited to 2 per person. It just seems a bit mean to me (well I guess you could always order more...my party did...and I wasn't remotely hungry for the following 24 hours). I'd rather have the option to taste a little bit of more than more of a little bit.BECAUSE, the food was delicious. The marriage of flavors and textures were amazing. I know a few people on here complained about ""food ADD"" with too much going on, but I think it was done very well and boldly so. The seared tuna with lamb sausage and grilled blueberries was a flavorful masterpiece. Other standouts were the calamari with rabbit ravioli, the hanger steak with perfectly crunchy snap peas, and the grilled oysters. The food on average was on the verge of being too salty. I was very thirsty after the meal.Service: At times, I felt a bit rushed as they tried to bring out the plates in waves a bit too close together (twice I had my plate removed before I was done eating). The waiter was very knowledgeable and attentive.Space: Tables were maybe a bit too close together, but very well decorated and love the open kitchen.I would very much recommend g&g to friends. Just come with a party of at least 6, so that you get to try more without being overstuffed by eating with your eyes. Also, be prepared for bold, unsubdued flavor combinations."
"I brought my parents here for their anniversary due to the obvious Stephanie - Top Chef connection. Â They took one look at the menu and were aghast. Â Goat? Yuck! Veal? Cruel! Skate wing? What! Etc. Etc. Etc.Well I took over ordering for the table, and told them to open their minds, close their eyes and try something new. Â They started noshing (slowly) on the plates and by the end of it they were full-blown goat evangelists! Â I even tricked my mother into eating veal and she loved it. Â I can't think of a single dish that ""failed"" or that we didn't completely devour leaving with nothing left on the plate! Â All of the proteins are insanely tender and moist and most are counterbalanced with pickled veggies of some kind with the right amount of bite.I come from a proud lineage of chocoholics and my mom declared the Fudgcicle dessert ""One of the best things I've ever eaten"". Â High praise and I absolutely concur.Extensive beer list, decent wine list and fair prices mean it doesn't have to be a special occasion place either. Â Highly recommended."
"The food was phenomenal...definitely worthy of 5 stars. I went with a somewhat larger party (6 people) and we ordered an array of dishes. Every dish we had was delicious.The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is the service. Our waiter was fantastic, but the timing of the dishes didn't flow very well (we had to wait quite a while in between dishes).Now to describe the dishes (in much detail)...We started off with 2 loaves of bread, one came with a (not your average) peanut butter and honey spread and the other came with a mushroom butter and tomato spread. Both were great.We then had the rabbit ravioli and fried calamari, which was one of my favorite dishes. The flavors and textures worked so well together. We also had the ham frites, which were basically crispy french fries dusted with ham. The dipping sauces it came with were exquisite...one was a cheddar beer sauce and the other a tomato aioli. The chickpea fritters had an interesting texture and flavor and were great.The goat carpaccio was also delicious; the meat was extremely tender. For the vegetable dishes, we ordered the roasted cauliflower and the pan fried peppers. The cauliflower was cooked to perfection. The creaminess of the Parmesan cheese worked well with the peppers (although some people thought this dish was too spicy).The goat chorizo flatbread was delectable and I could have eaten the whole thing by myself. The crispy pig face was the ""strangest"" dish we ordered, but the meat was extremely tender and the sauces (tamarind and cilantro I believe) with the arugula was a perfect combination.Our last meat dish was the pork ribs, which were atop a bed of a mushroom dish of some sort. The meat basically fell off the bone and the dish was good, but I probably wouldn't order it again.We couldn't pass on dessert, so we ordered the pork fat doughnuts. The dish was 2 doughnuts holes with blackberries and vanilla gelato. I loved how the gelato worked with the warm doughnuts and blackberries.So with all the dishes we ordered, our bill came out to about $150 (before tip), which isn't too bad considering how many dishes we ordered.Girl and the goat is a place that definitely lives up to its reputation and I will be going back there at some point!"
"Only ;) had to book 5 weeks in advance for a weekend reservation, and it was totally worth it. Â Right when we walked in we noticed the great space and the friendly staff. Â We were seated immediately and jumped right in with the fresh breads and spreads (unintentional rhyme, but here we are), and we also had the raw oysters. Â Both home runs right away. Â For our dishes we ordered the following (ranked in order of awesomeness, descending)-5. Â Pig face2. Cauliflower3. Scallops4. Chick pea fritters5. Lamb sausage stuffed calamari6. Escargot stuffed pork ballsThe pig face was unbelievable, and you must save room for this one at all costs. Â This isn't a recommendation... its an absolute must. Â The other dishes were all great, but I probably wouldn't order the escargot stuffed pork balls again. Â They were still good, but there are so many other things on the menu that I want to try! Â Can't wait to go back again, and I want to go with more people so we can try more dishes. Â Book your reservations now!!!"
"This place was awesome! We got there right at 5pm when it opened and there were already a bunch of people, but we did get a seat pretty easily. Â Loved the food, loved our waiter, just loved everything about this place. Â The food comes in small portions so it makes it more expensive but also gives you an excuse to try a bunch of things off their menu. Â It sounds odd, but I highly recommend the pig face. Â But there was nothing I didn't like! Â You won't regret eating here!"
"Girl and the goat was such a fun place to eat. I went with 3 other people and we got 3 dishes each + dessert and split everything. It's a place where everything has a distinct flavor however I didn't ever know what exactly made it so good. Good beer and cocktail list with typical prices. We got the green beans but they definitely not my fav- Â the chickpea fritters were AMAZING! Goat empanadas were another favorite. We got the pig face but wouldn't get it again- really greasy and heavy. We got the Thai chili desert that had pomegranate seeds- stand out. Also, it was very reasonable. We were stuffed and got drinks and it ended up being $60/ person. For what it was it was such a great deal."
"This is what eating is all about! Great service, and even better food. Chef Stephanie Izard takes comfort food and turns it on its head. And as someone who tries to limit carbs in my everyday diet, I took immense pleasure in the piping hot loaf of pretzel bread with honey mustard butter. Heaven! Already looking forward to next time!"
Been there twice.Would go again for the fried chickpeas alone.Great food - reasonably priced - great service.
"Amazing place. Â Great, creative dishes. Â Terrific service, fun atmosphere, great bar and bartenders...what more could you ask for. Â There is a slight tendency to order too much food, so take the lead from your server...they won't steer you wrong."
The roasted cauliflower and green beans in fish sauce were terrific. The rest was ok. The goat belly with lobster and crab was bland and confused. The pig face was decent. The rest was not really memorable. We waited 1.5 hours as was expected but the maitre d did actually never place our group name in the system. She remembered us and seated us so all cool there. Our server was very professional and we really appreciated the cauliflower comp.
"What more can I say but Woohoo! As good as it gets!It was delicious. I loved everything we had. We started out with 2 breads the carrot cumin and the fatbread. First I LOVE!!! bread and this bread was sooo delicious!! After that the hits just kept coming. Everything was served so fast. I never felt that I was waiting for anything. All of the dishes felt like they were prepared with such care. And well my favorite was the ham frites with smoked tomato aioli I know what you are thinking you go there and that is your favorite but I love bread and potatoes. If ever I have a bad day I will be here at the bar with bread, frites and a Â martini! All the food was so tasty and a great delight. I can not wait to see the Fall/winter menu I will be back for sure."
"Heavy eating, over-salted, sauce-y.Showed up with some friends (4 girls altogether) from out of town who were fans of the chef. The place was cute and comfortable.We asked what was normal and the waiter suggested we order some bread and 8 small plates to share. We split one bottle of wine but I didn't have any.We ordered green beans, chickpea somethings, empanadas, scallops, some other random things.As the plates came out, everything started out tasting pretty good. I love salt, usually the more the better, and everything was sauce-y, very flavored and salty. Eventually, too much of a good things meant we were all stuffed, couldn't finish the small plates, and were really parched. It was all really heavy. There didn't seem to be a range in the options. I also think the waiter got us to over-order. All of us woke up the next day still really full and severely dehydrated. I swear my face was super puffy all day (salt = water retention). Looked nice in all our touristy pics.Argh."
"Holy pajamas. Â This place knocked my socks off. Â I'm a food snob with a moderately sophisticated palette, and everything I tasted was like a swirly twirly harmonious wonderland of exotic flavors blowing up in my mouth that I'd either never experienced before or couldn't put my finger on.We went on a Wednesday night around 9pm so it wasn't hard to get a table. Â We sat at the community/chef's table by the kitchen, so it was fun to hang with some random peeps. Â Here's what we noshed on:Wait, first: Â ORDER. THE. AVIATOR for a cocktail. Â It's Gin + creme de violette + lemon juice and something else. Â Otherwise, we had:-one of the daily breads.. Â ah crap, I forget what it was called. Â if I had it to do over, I may not've ordered bread. Â it was great (and the carrot butter was to DIE for) but I could've stood to have saved room.-roasted cauliflower + mint Â + pickled peppers + pine nuts: outstanding. Â though the lady across the table from me said she got the green beans, and that they were 20x more orgasmic than the cauliflower. Â OTHER people across from us got the chickpea fritters and were dying over them.-fried oysters w/egg salad and capers - AMAZING. Â who thinks to put egg salad and oysters together?-lamb sausage stuffed calamari - very, very good. Â but not my fave.-crisp pork belly + aji aioli + caperberries - let me tell you something. Â I shudder at the thought of biting down on chicken fat and generally have an aversion to funky meat, so the idea of eating ""pork belly"" was - ahem - mildly terrifying... Â but this was light & so delicious I couldn't even handle myself.-FAVE - pappardelle and (some kind of pork)-DESSERT: bittersweet chocolate / shiitake gelato / toffee creme fraiche. Â There are no words. Â I have never tasted anything so outstanding in my entire life.-we did NOT order the scallops b/c they were 86'd for the night, but I heard they're one of the best things on the menu, so I'd snag those if you can.They're booked for the next 2-3 months on Friday & Saturday nights, so I would suggest getting your name on deck stat, or going on a weeknight as soon as possible. Â This was my favorite dining experience in Chicago, ever, hands down."
"Yes, yes, 1000 times yes. Â I enjoyed delicious cocktails (Best of 3 and Aviator), plus some gratis food since they were about 20 min late on our reservation.Things I really enjoyed: pretzel bread (served with Thousand Island and mustard seed butter), the scallops, the pig face, the crab knuckle (a special that night), hamachi, and the pappardelle sugo. Â Which was everything I had. Â My veggie friends enjoyed their dishes as well - ordering apple crisp soup, cheesy peppers, chickpea fritters (my fave of theirs), butternut squash ravioli, and cauliflower. Â If I had to pick a favorite, it was maybe the hamachi or the pappardelle. Â Or the pig face. Â Or the crab. Â Or maybe the simple, salty bread. Â I don't know. Â It was all really tasty.Our service was impeccable - the gratis food more than made up for the late reservation, plus our server was knowledgeable about the menu and made sure to ask about food allergies. Â He was quick to recommend unique dishes like the crab knuckle, and the dinner had a great pace to it - we were never overwhelmed by dishes and could carry on a conversation that wasn't just constant nomnomnoming.Everything was really quite lovely other than the table of girls next to us singing songs from A Little Mermaid. Â I know a ""girls' night out"" is super duper fun ladies, but save the singalongs for the frakking bar. Â WTF.It takes about 8 weeks to get a reservation, but it's worth it. Â Plan in advance, come hungry, and revel in its pig facey awesomeness."
"Walked in the door to a lively atmosphere, chic surroundings yet very comfortable. Â The hosts were friendly and welcoming; refreshing given the popularity of this place. Â We've all had that experience where the hostess treats you as if you are lucky to be there. Â And it was fun to watch Stephanie oversee each dish coming through the open kitchen.Food, dynamic! Â I love the way the servers explain each small plate when they bring it to your table. Â The flavor combinations are so surprising and delicious. Â We started with bread and goat cheese butter with corn relish; then chickpea fritters, scallops with cantaloupe and of course, goat belly with bourbon butter and lobster. Â UNBELIEVABLE!!Everyone has to try this place. Â I'm making my next reservation right now.Way to go Stephanie!"
"After hearing all about Girl and the Goat I was very excited to give it a try. Unfortunately, I do not believe it as good as all the hype would lead one to believe. I must say, I do not eat pork and that seems to be a large part of the menu. The food was good, it just was not spectacular. There are many other restaurants in Chicago that I would prefer to go to and probably won't go back to Girl and the Goat. On the plus side it did have a great atmosphere and service."
"No question, great restaurant and ambience. However, I wouldn't say it's a ""must try"" or one of the best in the city. One downside (or upside) is you'll smell like the kitchen after you leave. Â Good, solid choice though if you haven't been or can't get a reservation at a better place for the same price. Â If you're able, try the chef's table attached to the kitchen."
"Best place in the city! Â  Great presentation , service , and selection! Â loved the different items. Â definitely worth the very long reservations in advance. Â  Â even though I am a carnivore, I loved the vegetarian options."
"I ate here the day after Christmas while I was home visiting from San Diego and it was awesome!! I was so excited to go to this restaurant because I'm a big Top Chef fan and loved the season Stephanie was on!I loved the decor of the place! Nice, warm and inviting (especially from the chilly Chicago streets). My favorite part was the open kitchen where you could see all the action--nice big wood fire oven too!! Cool to watch while waiting for your food. The place was buzzing with energy and good smells. We had a 4 pm dinner reservation on a Sunday and it was packed! Awesome!All I can say is all the dishes we shared were amazing. My favorite was the roasted pork face--BEST PORK EVER! My friend and boyfriend adored the beef tongue. This restaurant definitely takes your palette on a wild and crazy taste adventure and gives you the opportunity to taste unique ingredients put together in creative ways. Love it! I wish I lived in Chicago so I could come back again and again! Next time...I'll be back!"
"I feel like I will be burned at the stake for this, but IMO the food is a notch below Publican, which is disappointing because I had really lofty expectations after perusing the menu. Â Don't get me wrong, nothing we had was bad, but there were very few dishes that stood out as mindblowing or must haves next time I go back. Â The lamb ribs were the highlight of my night, one of the most flavorful and delicious things I've ever eaten. Â The fire roasted oysters were also a nice treat. Â The pizza came up a little short, it was soggy and didn't pack the flavor I was looking for. Â  Everything else was good but not enough to get me to come back in (octopus, scallops, rabbit, ham frites, linguine and clams, pig face). Â The bread, despite the hype it has received, is good but nothing that will change your perception of what good bread should be.Overall, the menu was very similar to Publican (rustic, artisanal with a big focus on meats and fish). Â The environment and interior design of TGATG is beautiful, but I felt as if the flavors of the food came up short compared to some of the other offerings around town. Â It was affordable, but found the service to be annoying as we were aggressively upsold on everything. Â Every item we inquired about was ""the best ever"" and our arms were pretty aggressively twisted to choose a few more plates at the end of our meal, which left a sour note on the whole experience.Overall, it was a fun time, a little more upscale/date friendly than publican with comparable fare. Â For the quality and uniqueness of the ingredients, it is definitely a good value and the plate sizes are just right where you can sample several different items during the course of your meal. Â If I could give half stars, I'd probably bump it down to 3.5, but overall it was an enjoyable experience and I'm sure it won't be my last time there."
"Service, service, service and ambience, ambience, ambience are what totally make this place! Â Oh, the unique and tasty food combinations add to it as well.My friend and I decided to go here after work for some wine and a few appetizers, and we were both very happy with the choice.We were a little nervous when we walked in because the hostesses standing around the front desk had stone-cold faces and didn't even acknowledge us at first. Â My friend finally walked up to one of them and notified them that we didn't have reservations, and didn't need a table and wouldn't mind sitting in the lounge area (which was super cozy and comfortable, btw!), and they seemed fine with this.Our server was super attentive and very helpful. Â I hadn't even told her I was a vegetarian yet and she went over the menu letting us know what not to order if we had any dietary restrictions. Â As I am a vegetarian and my friend is lactose-intolerant, we were very happy knowing that up front. Â We decided to go with the bottle of Mohau Sauvignon Blanc and a couple of appetizers. Â The chickpea fritters were these amazingly flavorful, little bites of heaven. Â I have no idea how they got the inside so light and airy using chickpeas, but it was good. Â The roasted cauliflower wasn't my favorite, but I am not a big fan of mint so I think that's where the dish threw me off. Â My friend liked it though.If you're looking for an awesome place with great service to catch up with an old friend or even go on a date, this is it. Â I will definitely be revisiting Girl and the Goat in the near future."
"I have to be honest (and then wait to be strung up by my toenails by fellow Yelpers). I cannot figure out why everyone is complaining about the food being too salty. Neither the husband nor I thought anything (save maybe the goat cheese dessert) was too salty, and in fact, I was actually wanting a little more salt in one or two of the dishes. Commence stringing up. We had been anxious to try this restaurant since it was just a twinkle in Izzard's eye; and as was such, we took a 9:15 reservation one warm Friday night. We were seated almost immediately (though we'd been warned by Yelp that even if you have a reservation, waits can creep up), and our server could not have been more friendly. The decor was lovely, if a little dark. I probably don't need to continue, the previous 138 reviews do an excellent job of capturing an accurate picture of the interesting, delicious and creative cuisine. Indulge me anyway: Simon Says Bread- (rye with butter and garlic dipping oil). Delicious, but we are skipping next time in favor of another small plate. Cauliflower (with pine nuts and Parmesan)- Our hands down favorite dish of the night. And neither of us like cauliflower. Go figure. Scallop with veal. Smoked goat pizza. Skirt Steak- also delicious, but expected. Should have opted for the pig face instead. Lesson learned. Unsolicited advice: Skip the wine and beer (you've seen it all before, I am sure) and have one of their insane cocktails. I can't remember what it is called, but I had one with vodka, Pimm #1, cucumber, mint, and lime and it was ... well... just get one. All in all, a wonderful meal for a (fairly) reasonable price. Izzard loses a star for the total Foochebags that were seated next to us. Shut up! No one cares."
"There's not much too say that hasn't been said before, but here goes:+1 for dining at 4:30 without a reservation+1 for a enjoyable varied menu (our faves were the grilled octopus dish and goat empanadas)+1 for service that was preternaturally attentive but no intrustive+1 for excellent cocktails+1 for a funky playlist that included music by yours truly (Sly Stone)"
"Fair warning about this place - it's obviously one of the hottest restaurants in the city right now and it showed both why it is and the effects of being such a culinary focal point.We arrived at 7 for our reservation for 4 but weren't seated until 8pm. Ouch! They comp'd us a couple dishes to make up for the delay but we were still not the happiest crew by the time we sat down. Also walking in is like walking in to a wall of sound - not quite crazy bar loud, but with wood ceilings and no sound dampening materials to speak of, everything resonates. Quiet romantic dinner this is not.But on to the main focus, the food, which as many others have stated, was excellent. We started off with the chickpea fritters, then moved on to 8 other dishes. The strongest oddly enough was probably the green beans, the weakest was the short rip - the meat was a little tough and the edamame you needed to eat with your fingers which got you nice and messy. Cauliflower, frites, sausage stuffed calamari, and ravioli were also highlights. We then ordered two deserts which didn't blow us away. So overall, fantastic food, nice service once we finally got sat, and hoarse voices from screaming over the din of everyone else. If that sounds appealing to you, try to get in asap; if not, you may want to wait a few months until the next big thing pops up and action here dies down a smidge."
"Ate here twice in the last 2 months, late night reservations are always pretty easy. Loved the changes to the menu specials on what seemed to be a daily basis. Great wine selection at a decent price. If you are into adventurous eating this is the spot, some highs such as braised lamb shank, and some oddities like escargot ravioli. All good and creative, highly recommend trying some of the daily breads as well. Since the menu is ever changing with the seasons stop by when you have a well funded wallet and the mood to be a little crazy with what you are eating and you will enjoy; plus great show off conversation with you coworkers the next day."
"I've been here 4 times already, if that says anything.The reviews below have already given what I think is a fair judgment of G&tG. Â I was not a Top Chef person, but the fact that she is there just about every night is pretty awesome in itself. Â I went with a vegetarian & the server knew exactly which menu items could be made veg friendly. Â You must try:Kholrabi saladGreen beansCauliflowerHam frites (I LOVE french fries & this is like the best version possible)ScallopsPig faceGoat cheese bavaroisFrozen corn nougatSimply put, I dream about this food. Â Everything is moderately priced so while I wouldn't go every week, you don't need it to be a special occasion either.And I love the Tim Burton meets Stephen King painting on the wall."
"Man, what can I say about this place that has not yet already been said. Â I think that all I can say is that if you have an open mind and do not let the the thoughts of what the food is (IE Pig face) you will have a fantastic meal here. Â My favorite and hope that it does not go off the menu soon is the pork shank. Â It is huge and great to share on top of that I think that if I could only eat one thing for the rest of my life that may just be it. Â Overall just a fantastic place to eat."
"Went here on Tuesday night, around 5:45. We didn't have reservations, and were told we would be seated around 45min to 1 hour. Â Luckily, there was an open seat at the bar, so we took it and waited for someone next to us to leave. Â While we waited, we had a couple of drinks and the ham frites. Â The frites were great, best fries I have ever had, and the sauces that came with were good as well. We thought we had a Tom Colicchio sighting, but after talking to the guy he says he gets mistaken for him all the time, although I think he was being modest and it really was him.A chair opened up, so we decided to eat there at the bar. Â The bartenders were very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Â We had the fried oysters, cauliflower, rangoons, and the pig face. Â The pig face was the star of the menu, just a fantastic dish. Â The oysters came in a close second.For dessert we had the pork fat donuts...mmmm donuts. All in all a good meal, and I hope to go again and have a seat at one of the kitchen side tables."
"Girl and the Goat made my evening. Appetizers to start with, green beans, broccoli that apparently tastes like hamburgers, and the salmon tartare. I have never eaten good things in small packages!The staff members were amazing! They all worked together even though there were three of us. They made us wanting more and when we got just a little bit more, we were full before we knew it. Best service makes dining ten times better.Eating pig face is the best entree I have ever gotten. If anyone eats it, you'll feel like you're eating ""God's tears"" just because that's how magnificent it is. Eating desert made my meal more pleasant. We ate the goat cheese bavarois. Most decedent and filling desert Â I have ever had the pleasure of tasting or even looking at because the culinary skills are capable of making anything look dazzling.Go here whenever you get the chance. Their reservations are about a month to try and get in. If you get there early enough you can get seated at the communal table right by the chefs work place area."
Wow.... only word needed
Quick tip: Bar is full service complete with waitor - sit there. Fun small plate restaurant with probably the best food you have ever eaten.
"I already made another reservation. The Vegetarian options were outstanding! I loved everything we ordered, including the warm olives :) I'm still dreaming about the squash ravioli, with mushrooms and shroom creme. OMGNext time I will try the green beans, our friendly dining neighbors were raving about them. Between the two of us we ordered three items and one bread, And we had room for dessert which was well worth it.The Chef Stephanie Izard's came by and talked with us, She was very welcoming and open to hearing about our experience."
"Had a great time there early Saturday. Met the GM Tony ,great guy! And our waitress was attentive and friendly."
"Look, the food is good to very good but not great. Anyone who thinks this is ""the best meal of their life"" is either a huge tool or knows nothing of food.However, given the extremely reasonable price point of $12-15 per dish you can't beat the deal.This is the type of place where you go once and have a great time, go again and have a good time, go again and have a decent time and vow to never go back.Overall I really like the place, think the food is solid and the price point is great but if you took out the hype and the celebrity chef aspects of the place most people wouldn't even know about it."
"Having only heard phenomenal things about Girl and the Goat, I finally was able to try it out this past Friday night. My friend and I couldn't wait 3 months to get a 7pm reservation so we opted to go at 430p without a reservation and sit at the bar. This worked out perfectly! We sat down right away and our taste buds slowly were satiated!! We started with cocktails and ended up trying several of the them including Best of Three, Tempest, and 2 others which have slipped my mind. All were unique and delicious! We then proceeded on to ordering the fat bread, baby grilled octopus, chickpea fritters, and the pork shank. These were all some of the best dishes I have ever had; my favorites were the fat bread and the chickpea fritters. For dessert, we went with the butter peanut custard which was a excellent choice. Overall, the service was flawless and the food was fantastic. Â This place is expensive, but save your pennies because it is worth every cent!"
"YUM! Finally ate here, just showed up at the open and got seated immediately with a requirement to be in and out in 1.5 hrs before the reservations start rolling in. Cool vibe with the kitchen in the open. My only complaint of the night, the seating at the small tables just past the hostess stand is terribly uncomfortable - the bench side is low and stiff, and the chairs are way too tall for the table and have horrible backing! ... For the food we had the squash wontons in mushroom ragout, goat empanadas, diver scallops, and pig face with egg and hash. Â The ragout and the goat were the favorites, but everything was really good. We also had red flinstone bread with 2 spreads, the chipotle butter being the better of the 2. The pig face is like a real fatty bacon, and while super delicious, next time we'll order the pork shank instead, a much meatier option that the people beside us ordered."
"Amazing! Yes, it really is. We lucked out and went this summer, when you could still get in fairly easily. Then, in late Oct. or early Nov. I booked a table for 2 at 7:00 and I got one, in December. But I'm not going to bitch, because it IS worth it. We went for my b-day, 10 girls- and we were all blown away by everything that came out of the kitchen. Even the goat was delicious and I only tried it because I promised to try everything we ordered. (I'm not known for my adventurous palate when it comes to meats.) There honestly was not one thing that was anything less than mind blowing, but the green beans-dear god, what does she do to those green beans?! Maybe the best veggie I've ever eaten, and I love vegetables. The bread, the deserts and everything in between was memorably delicious.Incredible food, service, wine list- great atmosphere. Â Definitely worth the wait! Â Great bar too, comfy couches. Â I can't wait to go back."
"I'll be honest, my main motivation for going here was centered around my love of Top Chef. I never dined at Stephanie Izard's previous restaurant and if it weren't for her Top Chef fame, I likely would not be itching to go here right away.That's my disclaimer. Now let's get into the review because I did go and had a great time.First, the decor is gorgeous, dark, original and lots of open space and air. The kitchen is open so watching the action near the wood burning stove is awesome and all of the plates, bowls and dishes are in the open too so it adds to the decor as well. The tables and seats are wood, so the seats aren't super comfortable but they're fine. We sat next to the divider into the bar and I was a little worried about having a trendy woman's drink spilled on me, but it was fine.Food. The menu is broken into three categories: veggie, fish and meat. Goat is obviously showcased more on the menu but you can get a chicken or beef dish too. And it is smaller plates so definitely share and get 2-4 dishes for the table. We had the following: smoked goat pizzette, ham frites and soft shell crab with corn salad.My favorites were the ham frites (fries cooked in ham fat and served with delish sauces) and the soft shell crap. No joke, that crab and corn salsa was incredible and really set the stage for the meal. The pizzette was good too but compared to the grab, there was no contest. The wine selection is good too but bottles can be pricey. We got a Syrah that was tasty and the sommelier was very helpful. We skipped dessert because we were to full and honestly, the dessert menu didn't wow me. It was more savory than sweet (I prefer the latter) and even with an explanation of each, i still wasn't blown away.That said, i would definitely go back and try more things on the menu. But definitely make reservations!"
"So, it took me about 6 months to get a reservation for a decent dining time. By decent, I feel that sitting down for a meal between 6:30-8:00 is reasonable. I don't want to eat at 4:30, and definitely not at 9:45. I finally nailed down a 7:45 seating time early December. I am also not big on waiting for a table, so walking in and facing the possibility of waiting 2 hours is not fun. Obviously, my expectations are pretty high..... The four of us arrived on time and were promptly seated in the bustling space. It was hopping! Very busy, and every table was full from what I can tell. We were presented with a couple of menus and went to work right away at mapping out our dinner. Between the four of us here's what we ordered (in hindsight, we ordered too much food - but it was a good effort for first time diners) -Squish Squash Bread -Miso Bread -Raw Shibumi Oysters -Lamb Masala Pizza-Green Beans -Squash Ravioli -Lamb Sausage stuffed Calamari -Seafood Credo -Braised Beef Tongue -Grilled Pork Ribs -Roasted Lamb Leg Every dish was really good. Fresh ingredients, thoughtfully prepared, and flavorful. Our wait staff was friendly and prompt - our water glasses were ALWAYS full! It was a very good dining experience overall."
"It is no easy feat to get a reservation at this place. I was advised to make one a few WEEKS in advance, because this place is popular with both out-of-towners (me) and locals. Luckily enough, I was able to get a seat facing the kitchen! (There are only four seats that offer this, so you can imagine my excitement.)The service here is excellent. The servers are so friendly and very helpful in recommending dishes on the menu. For two people, I ordered 5 dishes total, as they are meant to be shared. Surprisingly, I ended up liking a dish of crispy duck tongues, paired with satsuma oranges and some leafy greens. It was so light and delightfully crispy. Their goat empanadas were amazing as well... crispy on the outside, but very moist on the inside! Their green beans were also very delicious.I found most of their dishes to be veering on the salty side, but they were very open to cut down on the salt content for the rest of our dishes once we made a request.All in all, I definitely recommend this place if you are willing to try innovative preparations of different meats! Make a reservation beforehand though (otherwise you may end up sitting and eating in the lounge area)."
"This meal was sublime. From the perfect portions to the fresh, radiant taste of every single ingredient, it was pure joy from start to finish. We were warned about the crowds and getting a table so my cousin got there early and nabbed us a cozy seat on the couches while we waited for a table. That in and of itself was a pleasure! The waitresses were so friendly and helpful and brought us some delicious courses right there. Then we went outside and sat with other patrons and admired each other's food choices! Each offering is a glorious gift. The taste of fresh summer ingredients surprised and delighted us at every step. Blueberries and fresh salmon: genius! A sparkling shrimp ceviche! YUM! Pig's face (yes) succulent and tender, melting in our mouths. Finally, a delectable dessert: something made with fresh corn, not sure what it was called, but the savory/sweet combination made us swoon. We ended the evening only because a sudden thunderstorm crashed our magic, but even that was handled gracefully by the staff, and we were wisked inside, dried off and sent on our way, satisfied and as thrilled as if we'd seen a great performance. Which we had. Bravo to Stephanie the amazing chef and all her team. It was a night to remember."
Amazing!!! My boyfriend is an extremely picky eater who generally has the palette of a 6 year and he loved every single dish we ordered. And our bill was practically nothing for the quality of food we received.
"Food glorious food. If you're even thinking of making a special trip here and waiting around a ridiculously crowded bar isn't your cup of tea, then make a reservation and make one soon. This place is hot, hot, hot! My friend had made a Friday night reservation a few weeks back and the only time she could get was 10:15. Well, could we really pass it up?Sure the place is hopping and I was expecting service to be a little sour, but boy was I impressed! Even at that hour our server was happy and helpful which speaks volumes to their service.Of course you know the food is wonderful. You can see the staff bustling in the open kitchen. The handcrafted cocktails were pretty good too. Small plates abound and are meant to be shared. Loved the cauliflower with pine nuts and the crispy pig face. The calamari was also delicious and was accidentally sent to us (lucky us). Squid with lamb sausage was tasty as were the frites but I'd probably opt for other items to try on future visits. We were so stuff there was no room for dessert sadly."
"Another useless review for this place, seeing as there are about a million of them. But I have to add my 2 cents. It was indeed an amazing experience. I though the plates, while small, were definitely decent sized portions and while I went with only one other person it would definitely be more advantageous to go with more people. I was thinking though that's a double-edged sword though- something you find amazing you get to eat more of than just one bite. I was slightly disappointed at the pig face...it was good, but not great. Honestly it tasted no different than pulled pork to me. The sauces were great though. The only other minor disappointment was the blood orange sorbet...The sorbet itself was fantastic- I wish the whole bowl was that- but the pistachio cake was really dry and crumbly and even the juiciness of the sorbet couldn't save it. Chickpea fritters were amazing...best vegetarian dish I've ever had. I could eat those all night. Soft shell crab was outstanding too. ""Linguine & clams"" ...again, outstanding. The sausage was great. Service was decent...slow but still good. They brought out one dish that was incorrect and ended up comping us for the linguine & clams. Even if that dish hadn't been comped, I didn't feel like it was insanely expensive for the quality of the food. I've paid more for less. I can't wait to go back again."
"I went back and forth on 3 or 4 stars (as I think it's really 3.5) and went with 4 because I do think the service was very good and the bill was less than expected. Â Granted, I had high expectations going in but I really wasn't blown away by anything. Â Don't get me wrong, it's good, but not outstanding. Â If I want tastier small plates, I'd prefer Morso or a tapas spot. Â I went with 5 others so we got a total of 13 plates. Â I really am finding it hard to say a standout. Â I did really like the pig face as well as other people have mentioned. Â The goat belly was good (as is any belly really, awesome fattiness) as well as the goat mousse. Â But were any of them outstanding? Â Negative. Â I was also the only person at my table that didn't complain about the overuse of salt so it's worth a mention (although I didn't really have that same opinion). Â The skate wing was not that good. Â If you want a phenomenal skate wing, go to Blackbird! Â It was like everything we got was good, but I can name other places where that same dish was better. Â Collectively though, it was a cool experience and I still would go back, but was a bit underwhelmed. Â It was packed (even though it was a Tuesday, as expected) and still the service was very quick. Â I wasn't a fan of the decor. Â The wooden tables were sort of out of place to me. Â Again, good, perhaps even great, but not outstanding."
"What a BLAST! Â It is alot more casual than I expected, but having all the great little plates to chose from and share - fantastic! Â Everything tasted great - and was very reasonably priced! Â I will admit - the price made it even better! Â Nice selections of beer - which do go well with Goat...and servers know how to make quality suggestions. Â Stephanie Izzard is also great with all the tourists who want pictures and autographs, as well. Â She keeps a smile on her face, while keeping the kitchen, which you can see while eating - running! Â It was a bit loud - but it was really worth the trip. Â Planning on going back with LOTS of friends - this is a great place for a group of people to go - not so Â much a ""date night"" - but take your friends and have at it! Â YUM!"
"Have been here 3 times and every time have not had one bad thing to eat! Â From the pig face, to the ham frites, to the green beans, everything was so good!Service is friendly and good!My favorite place in Chicago by far!"
"Service: 5 starsAtmosphere: 5 starsDecor: 5 starsFood: 5 starsWe were greeted promptly and introduced to our table which was close to where Stephanie was stationed at. Â Our waiter was very attentive and knowledgeable. Â The service was impeccable. Â He even introduced us to Stephanie after our dinner that we came all the way from Boston. Â We ordered the kabocha squash ravioli, seared scallops, wood oven roasted pig face, and anchovy garlic bread. Â All the flavors were very rich and flavorful even the bread! Â The sauce for the ravioli was so flavorful and the mushrooms that accompany it soaked up all the flavors! Â sooo yummy! Â The scallops were the winner of the night!!! Â I'm always afraid to try seared scallops because they are most of the time overcooked but these were not. Â These were perfect!!! Â The fried brussel sprouts that came with it were scrumptious. Â Crispy package bursting with juice. Â Along with a random crunch from the nuts. Â The pig face I can't say that I love it even though it had my favorite egg but it was interesting. Â The stecca bread came with garlic oil and anchovy butter. Â The anchovy butter was a lil coarser than I thought. Â It was interesting and different. Â I wished we can order more food. Â The prices weren't bad either. Â I miss it now! Â Don't know where I can find something like this in Boston."
"There has been so much hype about ""Girl and the Goat"" that I was afraid the restaurant couldn't possibly live up to my expectations. However, ""yes, it really is that good!"". Don't let the crowds scare you off (do make a reservation, though): once we were seated, we somehow didn't feel rushed or crowded. The food is, of course, outstanding, but I think what really makes the place is the staff. Everyone from the hostess to the bus boys were friendly but professional. It was an excellent evening, and I look forward to my next visit. In short: outstanding and creative food, cool space, friendly and professional service, and something different. What more could one ask?!"
I highly recommend this place. Â Delicious.
"QOTD""We use the whole goat""- our waiter""The Goat"" was a lot of fun with my beautiful tulip in tow for an early birthday celebration. The place is snooty but with a positive vibe. We had a great waiter. The menu items are weird, but very yummy. And for a Tuesday night, it was hoppin, baby!How's this for a TESTIMONIAL: Holly dropped her lamb sausage stuffed calamari on the floor. So, I scooped it up (less than 5 seconds) and scarfed it down myself. Hey, don't judge... it was incredible!I've never had goat steak before. It was good, and it did have its own unique goaty taste.Oh, almost forgot... great beer list too.five star goat... yow, bill"
"This used to be one of my favorite places, I've come here a couple of times and food and service have always been exceptional. Â I went again this Friday, after a few months away, and was uber excited to sample their menu. Â I know the menu changes seasonally but I hope the common theme this season isn't salt! Â Every dish we ordered was over flavored with salt, which left much to be desired! I thought it was just me, but my date agreed as well. Â Such a let down after the anticipation of returning for what used to be a great dining experience with a fun, relaxed, and upscale ambiance. Â Food: Â 2 starsAmbiance: 5 starsService: 5 stars"
"Count me in. Over and over again. Â Artuflly showcased Chicago dining at it's best to an out of town guest. The atmosphere was casual, yet refined. The selections offered complex flavor profiles, but they weren't overwrought. Everything was fresh, and adroitly prepared. The oysters were my favorite. They were from the west coast but I can't recall the name. Light and tangy zest did not overpower the oyster, just enhanced it. Not campbells was the epitome of comfort and warmth, crunchy satisfaction where it counts with dense moist perfection on the inside. Have the crispy pig face; it is a rhapsodic adventure for your tastebuds. Our server was awesome, with excellent recommendations for wine to pair our tremendously varied selections. What's that? Shitake mushroom gelato with brownie? Â Do it. And we did. And I'll do it again."
"When thinking about my visit to Chicago, I knew I had to check this place out.After trying to get a reservation all weekend, we settled on a Sunday at 9:45. Â The place was packed when we got there, and our table wasn't ready, but all was good as I went with good friends and nestled up to the bar for a glass of wine.We all wanted to try a lot of things, so in traditional tapas style, we order almost everything. Â The portions were huge. Â I would not suggest the ham frittes, they ended up being shoestring fries with a sort of bacon bits on them (yes this sounds amazing, but there is so many other interesting things on the menu, these are a waste of time and money). Â The goat flatbread was pretty good, as was the braised beef tounge (actually that was amazing). Â What I really want to talk about was the roasted cauliflower. Â best. cauliflower. ever. Â I am totally going to try and steal the recipe and attempt to make them for a dinner party.I would definitely go back for round two when I am in Chicago."
"We enjoyed our night event though for me it started a little rocky. Â Mostly because the server was beat; we ended up with a 10:30 PM reservation. Â I realize it's trendy, casual and all the buzz and rightfully so. Â Over all we were pleased with our selections. Â I loved the kabocha squash ravioli; yummy!"
"Girl & the Goat offers an unforgettable dining experience. The food is the most unique I've ever tasted. The ONLY reason I have rated it 4 stars is due to the fact that all of the dishes were extremely salty... otherwise, it would have been a 5 star in my book without a doubt!We made our reservation 3 months in advance (right down to the day/hour)- this is as far as Open Table allows bookings. We were seated within 5 minutes of our 9:00 PM Friday reservation at a nice table with a view of the open kitchen. Our server was totally awesome- we let HER choose the dishes! We told her to pick 7-8 items, excluding raw meat dishes and liver dishes. The menu changes FREQUENTLY, but these are the dishes we were served, in the order they came out:Dock in the Bay: soft, warm bread with delish lobster butter!Grilled Octopus: TOP-NOTCH, warm baby octopus with various beans and pistachiosSteamed Clams: great dish, served with pieces of rock shrimpPork Ribs: MUST get this dish. Best ribs I've ever had. Fell of the bone, juicy, incredible.Grilled Broccoli: Extremely Spicy - BEWARE! Melted blue cheese underneath is a delight. Loved the cashews thrown in. Green Beans: As good as everyone says they are, but definitely heavy with cream and salt. Normally, I could eat one pound of green beans in a single sitting. Due to the heaviness, I could only do 5-6 beans.Goat Belly: Incredible! Salty but so, so, so good! Served with pieces of lobster and crab. All around a fabulous dish. GATG is THE place to go if you want to try goat!!Pig Face: Also a must-try. Served with a fried egg on top. Too greasy, heavy, oily, ""piggy"" for me... tastes like ham mixed with bacon and fried in lard. Totally not Kosher. However, everyone else at the table just loved this dish!!Dessert: MET STEPHANIE IZARD! Took a picture with her when she was leaving the restaurant around 10:00pm."
Plates very small but very yummy. Â The food is very good and I understand the hype. Â I did not taste any of the meat dishes but the non-meat choices tasted great. Â The server at our table was good but nothing special. Â It would not be a good option for people who do not want to share or eat small plates.
Top Notch food!! Everything you would expect from a Top Chief. Â I have eaten here twice and not once had a bad thing to eat. I always leave dreaming of my next visit. Also the waiter Tony F. Is amazing:) Make you reservation now you won't be disappointed:)
"Okay, I thought that the restaurant was very good, but I'm not jumping up and down. Â The food was innovative, with unusual flavor combinations. Â The concept of ""small plates"" was good, but I'm just not into sharing small plates with big groups of people. Â It was just my wife and I think that the restaurant is better if you have a table of 2-3 versus a large group. Â A large group will have to order multiples of the same dish so that everyone gets a couple bits of everything. Â If I went back, I would disregard the concept of sharing everything, and just order a few courses for myself and ask for a couple plates to be brought together, instead of being coursed out one at a time. Â Again, good flavors. Â Service: Â good. Â Not outstanding. Â But then again, I really don't like to remember my server's name the moment I step out the door. Â Servers are there to bring food and alcohol quickly and quietly, not entertain me. Â That's what your dinner date is for. Â The server also kept worrying if my food was coming fast enough. Â When you're a server, don't play your hand unless a guest complains. Â Decor: Â excellent. Â Definitely a place I would stop in just for drinks and lounging. Â Price: Â eh . Â . Â . I feel I was charged about $40 more than the bill should have been. Â my wife and I had 5 small plates and a reasonable ($55) bottle of wine, and a couple of drinks. Â I paid $210 with tip and I just don't feel it was quite a $200+ evening that I got back. Â I would rather spend the $$ at a place like Blackbird. Â Will I go back, probably, but I'm not rushing back. Â Innovative: Â yes! Â Hot place right now: Â yes! Â Going to become a Chicago institution with staying power? Â Jury's out."
"Girl & the Goat lives up to the hype. I am amazed at how smooth this restaurant seems to be running after being only open a short time. We were seated early for our reservations, our drinks and water came promptly, our small plates came out quickly and in a logical order. Seriously, this kitchen and staff have got everything down pat. Big props to our waitress Amy, whom we loved. The space itself is gorgeous. Â From the cool fireplace grates, to the burned wood in the middle of the restaurant, the awesome painting near the front, the individual bathrooms downstairs... the whole place is upscale and rustic at the same time. Â The entire restaurant feels open, and never once did we feel crowded or overwhelmed with noise.The savory and sweet pairing in dishes is obvious across the board, and as far as small plates go, I've never had more taste packed into one bite (in a totally positive way). - The roasted beets were delicious, and the sauce was so simple yet pulled the dish together nicely - The seared scallops were our table's favorite. Perfectly cooked, and amazing with the almond butter and veal. - The skate was good. It could have had more aioli for my taste, but it was well cooked and flavorful. - The ham frites are sinful. If I could have licked the paper they came on, I would have. - I loved the skirt steak. The steak was not overdone, which I appreciated. And the goat milk caramel paired amazingly. - The lamb ribs! A close second favorite. Just perfect. The grilled vegetables (grilled avocado!) And dessert. We tried them all. My favorite was the goat cheese bavaroise. I scraped the little pot. Interestingly, my least favorite was the fudgecicle. Not that it was bad. In fact, that's what we said about the whole meal. We had favorites, but nothing was bad or mediocre. I think the menu is inspired and cannot wait to go back and try a whole new crop of small plates."
"LOVE this place! Â Great, social atmosphere and fantastic food and drinks. Â Went with a group of 5 and we tried about half the menu:Drinks - Jardin and something with 3 in the name (and Pimm's in it) - both refreshing and tasty.Small Plates - the Squash Ravioli, Green Beans, Scallops and the Goat, Pork and Veal Sugo were the favorites at our table. Â It was also really reasonably priced. Â We each had a drink + a bottle of wine + bread + 10 small plates for about $50 per person including tip.Really looking forward to going back - and hoping to score a seat at one of the tables facing the kitchen!"
"The restaurant is very well designed and attractive.The food, not so much. Â I'm and adventurous eater, but I was not impressed with the preparations here.I went with a large group and we tried a good percentage of items on the menu. Â The vegetable dishes were good, but most of the meat dishes - while ambitious - fell short, and some were plain old gross. Â I can honestly say I would never order any of the meat dishes again, and I would probably never return.I would be very surpised if the Girl and the Goat is open in a few years without a big change in cuisine. Â It's attracting a novelty crowd, but how many times do people go to ""dare you to eat this"" dining."
"Place is new, clean and charismatic .Food is really really good and local. All things considered, it's not expensive at all. Â  Highly recommended."
so good!
"I'll admit two things: 1. Yes, I'm pretentiously proud to not own a tee-vee.2. When Daniel told me we had reservations at Girl & the Goat with a colleague and her boyfriend, I was not terribly thrilled.Sure, I'd watched a few episodes of the first season of Top Chef, back when I was ""borrowing"" cable at a previous apartment. But even then, I was pretty disappointed. It was no Project Runway, that's for sure. And while I would buy something Jeffrey Sebelius designed (I'm dating myself! I haven't seen that show for years either), I wouldn't necessarily eat somewhere that was helmed by a reality TV superstar. Isn't that really the equivalent of letting the Kardashian clan make me supper?Well, it's not. It's actually pretty great.I started off with a stingily-poured old-fashioned, the taste of which quickly quelled my portion-size concerns. We began by tucking into a soup-themed bread -- my least favorite savory plate of the night. Why did we order something that seemed so gimmicky up front? Oh well. The smoked oysters merrily made up for that faux-bouchÃ©e, as did everything that followed. My favorites include the stunning seared scallops and the goat, pork, and veal sugo.After truly being overwhelmed by so many great flavors in the first half of our meal, dessert sadly helped us return to mediocrity. We tried the sambal pineapple-topped pork fat donuts, which were interesting, but for the sake on interesting -- not for the sake of flavor. The same can be said for the blood orange and parsnip creation. I have had root vegetables prepared deliciously for dessert (at Sprout, most notably); this fizzled for us.One of the best parts for me, besides the good food and company? The price. We managed to step away from a table that held seven medium plates, a round of bread and oysters, two cocktails, and two desserts for $50 a head. I would definitely return if I had a reservation for a time other than 4:30 on a Sunday, which seems to be all that's available to the hoi palloi."
"so good and worth the wait. Â Immediately after dining, I went on Open Table and made another reservation. Â Yum!"
"Had a late night dinner here with two friends who had both been here before. It did not disappoint at all.We tried the green beans,scallops, quinoa fritters,crudo,pork shank, and pig face. Everything was very very good but the highlights were the pig face,green beans and scallops. Also,the naan that came with the pork shank was as good as anything on the menu.We also tried a variety of the cocktails and beers. Great selections/choices.The vibe is also very relaxed even though it was packed when we walked in.Highly highly recommend this place."
"Girl and the Goat does one of the most important things a restaurant can do - have great bread. Not only is the bread amazing, but there's an actual bread menu of different types for you to choose from. My wife and I choose the squash bread that was phenomenal and came with a nice sweet jam. We then split a great deal of dishes.The roasted cauliflower w/parmesean was excellent.The strip steak style goat was meaty and melted in your mouth.The ham frites were ok but I felt we got way too many and the dried, cured ham became overwhelming after a bit.The scallops were very good with a hint of sweetness.The dessert we had was the fudge bar which had an ok flavor but I think an old school fudge bar would've been better.Still, an outstanding night with a great atmosphere, fun staff and a chance to see a Chicago celebrity!"
"Full disclosure: I have a nonsexual girl crush on Stephanie Izard. Before Girl and the Goat opened, I monitored her website and twitter feed daily for updates. This restaurant opening was a major highlight of my 2010.Hubs and I went last year when it was near impossible to get a table. We showed up very early and snagged a seat at the bar. I wanted to be the bartender's best friend. He was so nice and attentive and gave great recommendations.We started with sauteed green beans with fish sauce. A-mazing. I never knew green beans could taste so good.Grilled baby octopus - This was a good dish, but a little saltier than I prefer. We still cleaned the plate.Seared scallops - Holy. Crap. This is good stuff.Goat pork and veal sugo - Again with the holy crap.Grilled beef short ribs - This was my least favorite dish of the night. I wish we'd tried the goat pizza instead.Roasted pig face - I think I died during this dish and went to pork heaven. I still think about it. I'd been told by some friends to skip the bread. We did, and I think that is really smart advice. Just throwing that out there because this saved room for the most deliciously amazing dessert that has ever touched my lips. Unfortunately, it doesn't seem to be on the menu right now. But if ever you see the goat cheese cream brulee pop up, make a reservation immediately so you don't miss out. I really have no words to describe how good it was.I wish I could give 6 stars. Or 26. Girl and the Goat is outstanding for so many reasons. Just go."
"The name should be ""Girl and the PIG"". We had a reservation for 9:00, but they did not seat us till 9:20. Then, it took the server additional 20 minutes to take our order. We ordered the oysters (both baked and raw), and 4 other appetizers. The service was well below average, and the food sucks. We were lucky to discover that prior o ordering anything else. We paid the bill, and ran out. That was a complete waste of time and money. We went to Santorini (right down the street) for some good food. The best move ever!!"
Amazing food. Small portions but every bite is amazing!!!
"Honestly, there are so many reviews here that mine is just a drop in the bucket... but it is a drop of pure unadulterated joy. Who doesn't want that? We had about 6 dishes and 3 desserts. I have to give a shout out to Tony, our waiter, who looked as if he was enjoying the whole evening. With so many people to wait on, it was amazing that he took the time to talk and joke with us as much as he did. More pure joy! Thank you Tony!The food was worth the reservation wait. We had beet with avocado crÃ¨me fraiche and anchovies that was delightful. savory fishes, sweet beets and incredible avacado-y crÃ¨me fraiche. We had the cauliflower... Â so so good- we had halibut Â ( like filet mignon of the sea) and salmon tartare (fresh, bright, and stupid good with truffles and zucchinis and fried squash blossoms!) and goat chorizo flatbread ( with pools of creamy cheese and glistening with oil) and pig face and..i might be missing something...because by now I'm in a stuper just thinking about it. Everything was wonderful. Wonderfully wonderful.I never thought I'd say this sentence but I was born to eat pig face with an egg. It is what meat heaven tastes like. I hope if I'm ever eaten one day buy a wild animal, they enjoy my cheeks as much.  So all in all it was a great experience and I'd do it again.. in 3 months (that is how long our reservations took)! The atmosphere wasn't stuffy or snooty or condescending (which astounds me in that area soemtimes. I mean how many times have I paid for an expensive meal to be treated badly or by someone who wasn't having any fun at all? Too many times.)I think my friend summed it up well by saying "" If I worked here and saw anyone not having as much much as me, I'd tell them to take their food and leave and make room for the people who just want to have fun and laugh and eat!""So thanks Girl & the Goat... for you absolute love of food and the experience that goes with it!"
"Solid dishes served in a stylish and bustling interior space.As a vegetarian, there's not a whole lot on the menu that I've tried, save the veggie dishes and the breads. Â As far as the breads are concerned, I'm not impressed. Â On both visits, the breads that I tried (I've now tasted 3 bread options) were bland and warranted lots of butter or whichever sort of oil was served with the bread. Â On the other hand, the roasted cauliflower and a few of the other veggie dishes were certainly smack-yo'-mamma-in-the-mouwf good.In any event, check it out. Â You'll definitely have fun. Â Great space, nice bar and waiting area/lounge, buzzing with nightlife energy, and, yeah, a few d-bags in the mix, but whatever. Â It's Chicawgoh."
"This place do not disappoint. Â My fiance came here by walk in. Â Although the wait was a bit long, she got the Chef's table. Â  Yes, I did say the Chef's Table! Â Talk about great customer service at the front!The first time I came here, I tried making a reservation, but unfortunately, none were available for weeks. Â At last, I resorted to walking in and waiting. Â The wait was 2 housr, but man was it worth it!Their goat dont taste like one and in fact, it tasted like steak. Â I have never had a goat before but if that is how they taste, let me have another. Â The waitress was very kind and helpful. Â She set our menu selection for us and boy did she nail it on the spot. Â In addition to the goat, I had their oysters and calamari. Â Both were made in a way that fits my taste. Â My fiance loved every little bit of it. Â Who wouldn't right?My advice before coming here, make a reservation. Â If not, prepare to sit in the bar for a while or Starbucks down the street. Â Regardless of the wait, it is well worth the time and money spent!"
"Stephanie izard is a top chef wizard - This is the home of the best meal ive ever eaten. If i comit a crime and end up on death row, this will be what i request as my last meal and my crime will have been smaking who ever gave this place less the four stars! Shame on you!"
"Went here over the weekend with some out of town friends for the first time. The food was good, but felt it was extremely overpriced for portions. Between the 4 of us, our bill was about $400, which I don't mind, but what I do mind is still being hungry after. However, I did mention we were newbies and the tables to either side of us were getting dishes that were A LOT bigger and looked delicious. So will definitely try it again."
"Booked a 10:45 pm slot (the only one available) on Open Table, but when we walked in (right on time), the servers gave us a puzzled looked and seemed all too ready to send us on our way. Â Upon confirmation of our reservation, we were rushed to our table and told that the kitchen would be closing in 10 minutes and that we'd have to get our order in quickly. Â Aside from this minor unpleasantness of feeling rushed, my visit to G&G was enjoyable. Â While it didn't quite edge out my fave spot (Avec), it provided some stiff competition. Â We ordered the sauteed green beans (ok, but didn't live up to hype of other reviewers), the roasted cauliflower (my mouth waters just typing it), seared scallops (yum), sauteed shrimp (tasty), veal sugo (disappeared as soon as it was set down on our table). Â The Rocco (Pinot Noir) that we had with our meal was fantastic.If I can score a slightly earlier reservation at this very popular restaurant, I'd definitely go back."
"Without a doubt a fantastic restaurant. Â If you are not the experimental type with weird sounding foods, this isn't your place. Â But in my experience, the ""weirder"" the better. Â The duck tongue and pig face were amazing, as well as the knowledgable and friendly staff. Â Waiting 5 months for a Saturday night, 7pm reservation for 4 was worth the wait. Â We will return again and again."
I have been here twice and loved the food both times. The service is good and they staff is fun and helpful. The food has interesting names like pig face but it is all amazing. It's like they want the food to sound and look weird or gross so they can blow you away with delicious taste. They have great cocktails that pack the punch. Reservations need to be made months in advance but its worth the wait.
"I have been wanting to come here since I went jogging past this place during the spring and they were working on it. Â I followed Stephanie on Twitter and have been patiently waiting for a chance to come for dinner. Â Try #1 failed as we waited too long to get reservations for that week, unless we wanted to eat at 11pm which is past my bedtime unfortunately. Â Try #2 was successful last night and I am happy to say it lived up to the wait and all of the hype.Three of us went and were seated right away. Â It was packed and loud but in a good way, like you knew you were in a pretty happening place. Â I think I had a smile on my face from the minute I sat down. Â The details are what makes this place awesome. Â The goat graphic on the paper napkin ring, the uniformity of the separate menus, the decor on the walls, the bathroom styling, I loved everything.Onto the food and drinks... our waiter Patrick was awesome, I wanted him to sit down and eat with us, he seemed really fun and knowledgeable and to really like his job. Â He gave us some suggestions and overall, I can't complain about anything.I started with the Victory Golden Monkey ale, great recommendation. Â We split a bottle of malbec later, also great. Â We started with the Not Campbell's bread, broccoli cheese bread with mushroom soup butter and tomato aioli. Â We should have ordered one for each of us, it was excellent and I would like this bread for breakfast every day. Â And i could eat the mushroom soup butter with a spoon, thank you.Onto the plates, we got the chickpea fritters and roasted cauliflower. Â Both were great, Aunt didn't like the cauliflower but I mean it's cauliflower, how mind blowing can it get? Â Husband and I polished that off. Â The chickpea fritters and the hummus underneath were lovely.We got the himachi crudo with pork belly and that was by far my favorite dish of the night. Â I just shoved the whole thing in my mouth and the combination was amazing. Â We also got the barramundi which was good but we all agreed was our least favorite of the dishes. Â Black beans were crunchy which was surprisingly good but the mushrooms had a strange taste, most likely a personal thing. Â We finished with the goat, pork and veal sugo which was the second best dish we had. Â The pappardelle was perfect and the whole dish was perfect. Â For dessert we got the fudgsicle and the cocoa nib donuts and both were good, not great. Â We probably in hindsight should have chosen the other two but at that point, I was so full, a bite of anything sweet would have done the trick. Â Overall, Stephanie did a great job and I will for sure be back, very very good stuff."
"I'll admit it: I love Top Chef, and I was a little too excited when Girl & the Goat opened. Hubby and I celebrated our 5th anniversary here, and I thought it was a good choice for the occasion. Everything we ordered was absolutely delicious. I loved the atmosphere and literally all of the design elements. It is such a great space!I love that the menu is primarily small plates, so you can get a variety of flavors and taste experiences. The menu had just the right balance of wanting to satisfy curiosity, and food that I was able to pronounce (yes!).I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone (although it's not a vegetarian friendly meal, there are some vegetarian and some fish dishes).Must order: Pig Face, Chickpea Fritters, and the Ham Frites."
"Second time around topped the first. Â Lucked out and got the seats at the kitchen again...thank god for special occassions!!! Â Don't know that I could go back and be seated anywhere else now...I am officially spoiled.Started with bread again and got the Culture Club - Sourdough Bread with the beer cheese sauce and the cultured butter. Â Fantastic. Â Said it before and will say it again, if you're complaining about paying for bread, you're ridiculous. Â Good bread compliments a meal and takes a skilled hand. Â Well worth it. Â First course was ham frittes . smoked tomato aioli . cheddar beer sauce. Â Had to do it...I know it's just frites, but I couldn't stop myself. Â I wanted them last time and I was definately not missing out again. Â I literally would have used my fingers to eat the crumbs had people not be around us. Â The sauces were fantastic as well.As we we're finishing, our server brough us fried stingray . egg salad . capers on the house. Â We didn't order these and both times we have come, the things we got complimentary were literally the best things we had. Â This was not an exception. Â I lcould eat these every day.I wanted to get the chickpea fritters again, but thought I should branch out since my husband insisted on getting the green beans again, as well as the grilled pork ribs . tomatillo-mushroom slaw . grilled scallion vinaigrette. Â It was like Sophie's choice. Â So, Â we had the sauteed green beans . fish sauce vinaigrette . cashews. Â They were again fantastic. Â Re-reading my previous review, I wish I would have fought for the chickpea fritters. Â Man, they were so good the first time, but I digress.The next course was the grilled pork ribs . tomatillo-mushroom slaw . grilled scallion vinaigrette. Â So sad we had two of the same dishes from our last visit, but my husband was dreaming of them. Â They were fantastic, but went down from being one of our favorite dishes last time. Not because they were bad, just because everything else was just ridiculously good.Finally, we ended with their special, a confit goat belly topped with lobster and fennel. Â Wow, was this rich. Â I loved it, but had to force myself to finish it. Â Definately heavy. Â I wanted to fall asleep on the table right there, but we had to have dessert.We had the doughnut type things stuffed with Hook's cheddar. Â So amazing. Â Then the waiter brought us a complimentary chocolate cake with chocolate thai chili gelato. Â That was more up my husband's alley - the gelato ended with a spicy kick and he enjoyed it thoroughly.We finished up with a coffee, to which my husband said ""Even their coffee is delicious!"" Â We were then headed to see Wilco at the Lyric Opera House. Â It seemed like such a good idea to go to Girl and the Goat before the concert, but I really just wanted to take a nap after all that goodness.May be making another reservation as we speak. Â So worth it."
"Very big and very loud space although the long kitchen is nice and Stephanie Izard was very noticeably there expediting which is a nice touch. Â The food is good but most dishes seemed to be missing that element which would have made them great. Â The service was also quite good but the wine list is overpriced so you're either forced to pay 3x retail or as a better option go with drinks or beer. Â Overall, I much preferred Scylla, it's a shame it has been replaced with this huge, money making machine which for me just didn't live up to the hype. Â I can't really blame Stephanie though for following the money."
"I went to Girl and the Goat a couple of months after it opened. I wish I had written this review sooner, because I forget most of the details of what I ate, but I do recall that it was a great overall experience. The staff was friendly and carried themselves in a way that suggested they were proud of the restaurant, but not pretentious as a result of it. I appreciated that. I split about five or six dishes with my girlfriend, and about four months later, the dishes that had the most lasting impressions were the crispy pig face, the ham frites and the cauliflower. Â So...get those if you go.The prices are a little high for me to go back on a frequent basis, but I look forward to coming back at some point soon."
I cannot wait to go back and try more of the menu. Every single thing we tried was amazing. The server knew what she was talking about and the space was very cool.
"Who can live up to the hype? Â This place can. Â It had only been open a couple of days when we went and yet the staff was firing on all cylinders. Â The food was outstanding as expected and the wait staff was well matched. Â They were friendly and helpful with drink suggestions, food recommendations, etc. Â The menu is broken down into three categories: veg, fish, and meat. Â This is very helpful in a small plates restaurant I find. Â We split things from each column and every one was perfectly prepared.There were many things on the menu that looked tremendous and didn't get to try. Â I'm definitely looking forward to going back and giving those items a taste as well."
"I definitely believe that this place was well over hyped. The service was very good, our waitress was very attentive and had some good recommendations. Â They were pretty busy by the time we left too.The atmosphere is nice. Â The whole place seemed very clean, and the lighting added a nice ambiance. Â A lot of unique food items and the pig face was excellent.So the negatives:We were seated almost elbow to elbow with the table next to us. Â I was sitting at a table for two in between two other tables. Â There was probably 6-8"" between our table and the tables on either side. Â It made it a little awkward. Â The worst part was that when we got there, there were a lot of tables open. Â I understand they may have had a lot of reservations, but I would rather wait for a table that doesn't looked like it was wedged in last minute.The food portions were pretty small compared to the expensive price you paid for them.So 3 stars it is, I was not overly impressed."
"Went Satruday night with friends. Â Made the reservations 3 months ago and could not wait to go. Â Love to try new and exciting places. Â Ordered drinks at the bar while waiting. Â Got the bar bill and almost dropped. it. Â $37 FOR A SMALL POUR OF HIGHLAND PARK 18. Â Are you kidding. Â $37 for a glass when the entire bottle costs $85. Â At 13 pours per bottle and I would guess by the way they measured, you could get 14 or 15, thats $500. Â I almost walked out but decided life is too short and its only money.Then I see you charge for bread. Thats like a chinese place charging for tea. I get the small portion idea, but make sure you expalin how small, small really is. Â We ordered 8 dishes and 2 desserts and I have to say with the exception of the mussels, there was not one dish that Â was enough for 4 to share. Â Teh goat belly barely offered a sample for 2. Â Some dishes were good but overall I ahve to say I was not impressed. Â Certianly not worth waiting 3 months. Â There are so many great places to go. Â At least you made your money on me with one visit. Â Maybe thats the whole idea."
"I dropped in at 5'ish and found a seat at the bar. Â The place was alive and nearly full. Â Fun atmosphere and wait/bar staff all fun and enjoying themselves.Ordered the fat bread. Â Cannot imagine anything more delicious that the ""butter"" and chutney combo it comes with. Â I won't tell you what's in it - but you will have sweet dreams of it for days after.The shaved kohlrabi fennel salad, the fat bread and a weiss beer was all I needed for the pit stop ($21) - the real purpose of which was to recon the place for a possible future visit.I made dinner reservations for two weeks out before I left. I requested a table at the edge of the kitchen, so my date and I can watch the food art. Â :)"
"Regardless of the reviews, I was confident that the food would be excellent. Not because of the Top Chef BS but as I walked through the revolving door I could smell the pleasantly rich, smokey, and flavorful aroma of the cuisine. I met up with my friends and bought us a round of drinks - I forget the name of the signature cocktail but it was like their own version of the Pimm's Cup. Excellent! I ended up having 3 over the night. The bartender who served me was a little slow. He gave me no pen to sign my tab. I kept waving and another bartender helped me out. But the original bartender was kind of a dick and just said the pen must have fallen off the bar. Whatever.Our waiter Brennan was amazing. Almost like he was a friend. He was fun and knowledgeable. He loved my credit card with penguins on it.I won't go into deep descriptions but here is what to order:- hiramasa crudo. crisp pork belly. aji aioli. caperberries- seared scallops. pumpkin brandade . pecans . fried brussels sprouts . tarragon . pomegranate- pan roasted barramundi . black beans . buttermilk squash . chicken of the woods mushrooms- smoked goat pizza . apple soffritto . black kale . ricotta . cipollini- skirt steak a la planca . chiogga beets . house pickles . wilted romaine . salted goat milk caramelI don't recommend the sausage stuffed calamari as the sauage is dry and the taste overpowers the delcate flavor of calamari.The atmosphere is fun and airy. Great place for so many occasions: group dinner, date, girls/guys night out; but not so great for kids."
"Stephanie really has out done herself... Â This place was everything it was billed to be. Â Mind you, I made the reservation two months ago and had actually forgotten that I made the reservation until I got the reminder from Open Table. Â It was a pleasant surprise for this otherwise very mundane Monday.The reservation was for 830pm on a Monday night and I was shocked at how packed the place was. Â I've got to assume that all of Randolph Street is envious of how crazy packed the G & the G are every night of the week. Â If you don't have reservations, make them now. The goat t-bone special was awesome. Â The green beans, the flank steak - both wonderful. Â The fourth dish was something out of this world. Â I cook and use cauliflower quite a bit - but I have never tasted cauliflower as blissful as that which was served here... Green, yellow, white and purple cauliflower, banana peppers, pine nuts, (i think) parmesan cheese, Â mint... Holy moley. Â It took everything I had in me not to lick the serving bowl. Â Way to go, Ms. Izard! Â You are killing it right now!"
"So my friend won a twitter contest that Steph Izard let her attend the soft opening with a guest, and lucky me, I was the guest! The menu changes but I was really impressed. The bread was amazing, as well as the goat-stuffed prawns. I loved the sauteed green beans in the fish sauce vinaigrette. Â My favorite had the be the green beans and the dessert though. A layered round cake, blueberry compote, and goat cheese fraiche topped with a brulee-like topping in a bowl - I could've eaten this all night. Because it was a preview, the meal was free, and utterly amazing. If you have a chance to go, do it. It's totally worth it."
"I waited for months for a reservation here...and I don't know if it was the hype or what, but I guess I expected flawlessness and that was definitely not the case. Stephanie Izzard is a great chef and I did enjoy her food, but I didn't love everything we ordered. It was definitely top notch, creative, and tasty, but I think it's more hype than anything 'cause I have had better.Pros: Great atmosphere, beautiful, ambiance, great service Cons: Ridiculous wait and incredibly noisy Pros: Delicious food, they bring it out quick and pretty comparable in regards to pricing Cons: Not much variety---mix it up with the meats!! Pros: Great for special occasions with groups Cons: Awful for dates---too loud for conversation and the tables are too long. You're cramped to the next table."
"I have so many favorites here, but I know their menu supposed to change with the season. Â The food here is simply amazing. Â The price looks reasonable but the portions are really small. Â Think of it like tapas.I love everything about it, except for dessert. Â It was something with goat cheese and way too overpowering and gamey for my taste.The restaurant is busy and reservations are booked a month in advance. Â I was here for my bday with the bf and definitely not the place you go to chat. Â Our only form of communication was typing out our messages via the notepad app on my iPhone. Â The place is THAT loud.I enjoyed my overall experience and will be back here just to eat and not talk."
"The food was too greasy and far too salty. Â There are a few interesting things on the menu, but they don't deliver."
"Before heading to Girl and the Goat we had no idea it as a small plates restaurant. Our server recommended that for two people we should get 5 dishes, and that is what we did. Â Holy though - it was way too much food! Â It's not that the portions were out of control huge because they weren't. Â It's that everything is so dang rich and delicious and well-made that you fill up quickly. Â We had an amazing meal:Pretzel bread - dripping in butter and comes wit 2 sides of butterChickpea Fritters - delishScallops w/brussels sprouts - I'm not a seafood person but these were easily the best brussels sprouts I've ever had in my life and I LOVE brussels sprouts!Skirt Steak - OMG incredible - sweet and savory - GET THISSweet Potato Gratin - Sweet potatoes that taste like candy, but in a stew - so rich and so amazingBBQ Ribs - delicious meat Sticky Toffee Cake - eh - Â my least favorite part of the mealBittersweet Chocolate w/mushroom gelato - easily my favorite part of the meal. Â I was beyond stuffed by the time we got to dessert but I just couldn't stop eating because this dish was so amazingOn our trip home we talked about Girl and the Goat ad nauseum. Â The boyfriend and I went together and both agree this restaurant would be more fun in a large group where you could try more of the dishes. Â Sure we had a lot of food, but it would have been nice to have tried even more."
"Four adults came from the Cincinnati area getting reservations 3 months in advance! Â (good idea) Â one week prior I got a call from them confirming the reservation (great idea) Â We arrived at 540pm (for a 545pm res) and were promptly seated (outstanding) . Â The wait staff is very attentive and really knows their menu. Â  Several bottles of wine were ordered, along with 7 dishes(more than enough), each one better than the last. Â The taste sensations were beyond belief, finished off with a wonderful dessert. Â Overall I am unable to find any more enthusiastic adjectives to describe my experience, this is one of the finest restaurants I have ever eaten in(I travel worldwide regularly). Â  Â This is a dining experience like no other! Â Bravo Â  Girl & the Goat"
What can I say...this is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago! The plates are small so you will want to get a bunch. I was surprised with how delicious the vegetables were. The cauliflower was amazing! You will want to get about 4 dishes for 2 people. Great for groups! The chef pairs surprising ingredients and it makes for a wonderful combination of perfect flavor!
"No question, Girl & The Goat lives up to the hype. Our dinner here was perhaps one of the most enjoyable I've had in Chicago.Every dish we ordered, from the chickpea fritters to the goat loin, was exquisitely prepared, flavorful, and interesting. The stand-out dish, however, was definitely the pig face - don't let the name put you off, you're not actually served a pig's head, as exciting as that may be. In addition, the kitchen was extremely accommodating of our vegan friend; the chef prepared a couple of plates that were more than just the standard steamed veggies and white rice that vegans are often stuck with. However, if you do have special food needs, it's wise to alert the restaurant ahead of time so they can prepare.Our wait staff was attentive but not intrusive. Prices are extremely reasonable for the quality of food. The only downside is having to make reservations 3 months in advance!Congratulations to Ms. Izard on one of Chicago's newest jewels in its restaurant crown."
"First - big shout out to my friend KT S. for her forward thinking. She grabbed us a Saturday night reservation about 2 months ago and it was well worth the wait.I was afraid the food was going to be over-hyped, but turns out that it was perfectly hyped. It really is that delicious. We sat down as soon as we arrived at our designated reservation time (which I gather from other reviews is not always the case). Our waitress was great, but way too soft spoken. I really only heard about half of what she told us. She recommended that we order 2-3 dishes per person. Um...sooooo glad we didn't take her advice. We ordered 7 things for the 4 of us and that was PLENTY. She also really pushed the Prawn special. Which, as it turns out was the most expensive and least delicious dish of the night. A big EH on that one. But everything else was total perfection. fat bread - green beans - little goat weenies - pig face - calmari - ham fritesMy childhood love for green beans has been renewed thanks to g&g. Now if that's not something to be thankful for, I don't know what is. Can't wait to go back!"
"Shama-lama-ding-dong this place is good! There are hundreds of raving reviews of this place so I'll keep this brief. GO NOW! They just received a Michelin star so it's going to be very tough to get in. No matter, make a reservation now even if it's for next century. This place is very adept at food creations that don't make sense until you taste them. I was floored by several pieces here. Top that off with exceptionally good cocktails and a great beer selection and you've got my last meal on earth. Bravo.I will say there were a couple of things we ordered that didn't wow me. We ordered almost everything on the menu though. Perhaps some of the less glowing reviews may have just ordered the wrong things."
"There is a lot of hype about this spot, but it totally lives up to everything you hear! Â I booked a reservation for me and a friend at 10:45p on a Sat...it was the first avail opening. Â We walked in around 8:30, expecting to hang at the bar for a while and maybe get seated slightly earlier. Â Luck would have it, they were able to seat us within a few min of arriving! Â Our waiter was great! Â Really nice and a lot of fun...I wish i could remember his name. Â He walked us through the menu and made really great recommendations for both food and wine. Â All were great choices based on what we said we liked/disliked (and not just the most expensive thing on the list which is really appreciated)! Â We tried at least half the menu items and all were fantastic! Â I think I liked it a bit more than my friend, who wasn't crazy about one of the dishes, but we both agreed the food was all so different and worked well together. Â The roasted beets, lamb sausage and pig face were my favorites! Â This place reminded me a lot of Susan Feniger's Street. Â Same type of deal...small plates, inventive dishes, fun atmosphere...totally a spot for foodies!"
"Oh, I don't even know where to start. It was dinner and a show, for sure! First things first Â - the whole place smells like a camp fire. Apparently, how they told us, they have a whole one wood burning grill, a wood burning oven and not a ventilation vent, I guess. My hair and clothes all smelled like smoke afterwards, and it was hard to stay inside - very unpleasant. The place seems to be popular - they are trying to squeeze as many people as possible - tables are cramped - our server/bus boy's butt was overhanging our table and food when he was helping the table next to us. Server did not really walk us through the menu, he asked if we had any questions. I did say that we were looking for something light and refreshing, since we had pizza for lunch. He just said: oh ok, so no pizza for you tonight. WTF!? Any useful recommendations may be? So he did suggest to order 4-5 dishes since they all are supposed to be shared. They have V (for vegetables, F (for fish), and M (for meat). V had no salads. Well, there were two, but non of them any any green in it. F had only one kind of fish, the rest was sea food - calamari and such. WTF#2? Call things its names please! I guess you could argue - it is shell fish! So we order a ""salad"", scallops, fish and chicken. Fish makes it to the table before the salad. We take a bite... I guess this is what they call bold flavor... I call it a heart attack on a plate! Too much salt and too much butter/oil! Then the salad makes its appearance. Okey.. Should we finish the fish or what? Nervous bus boy took my plate away (I was done with the course) and put a clean plate in front on me and my husband. My husband was still eating his course, and this just looked like: ok, you better hurry up! Very unprofessional. Then Scallops show up, and then the chicken a minute later. We hurry up to finish up the scallops, we don't want the chicken to cool down. Insane. Who the hell brings stuff randomly to the table? So we ate the scallops and did not get a new plate for the chicken. The chicken dish was made out of wood and was cracked actually. All the chicken juices spilled on the table and nobody bothered to wipe that off. So we start on the chicken and our water comes up:""I was waiting on the scallops in the kitchen and they seem to be late"". WTF#3? We already ate them! In the mean time new clean plates show up. WTF#4? We don't have any more courses and we already ate our chicken on the dirty scallops plate. Pass forwards, the plates disappear. All that with bus boy's butt hanging over our table at random times. And, I almost forgot: the wine glasses are ridiculous. They are big fat red wine glassed without the stem. I could not hold that with one hand.Please people, if you don't know how to run a restaurant, then just don't! Or go to Mastro's and learn!"
"I am a Top Chef fan and was thrilled that Stephanie won and I really wanted to love this restaurant. Â But I didn't. Not the worst place I've ever been, but definitely not the best.Restaurant itself is very stylish and cool. Â Best thing we ordered was the octopus which was absolutely fabulous. Â But sadly, everything else left me wanting. Â Beet salad - very skimpy on the beets. Chickpeas three ways - I dunno. Â Was just ok - and is it me or does $13 seem like a lot for a shared little plate of chickpeas?? Goat pizza - tasted funky to me, though my husband liked it. Chicken - very moist - yet bland. Paired with watermelon - didn't go well together for me.Oddest thing about the menu - divided into 'V' for vegetable 'F' for fish and 'M' for meat. Â Lets read off the fish section:hiramasa crudo. crisp pork belly. aji aioli. caperberriesorgrilled shrimp . spiced goat . broccoli . cilantro . kohlrabi kimcheeandseared scallops. braised veal . caponata . marcona almond butterSo why are you calling this 'fish' - when its got goat and pork and veal? I am not a vegetarian so not a problem for me - but it seems strange that they would say here is your fish section - where you can find the nice spiced goat.I think perhaps the chef is trying too hard to make things unique and interesting and trendy. Â It all fell short for me."
"Stephanie is a winner!Awesome food, good service...very busy, make reservations..you will smell like a fire pit when you leave!"
"This afternoon and friend and I tried Girl & The Goat for the first time. We called about a month and a half before hand for a reservation. We walk in, right off the bat amazing service. They told us that we would be sat at the best seat in the house, the chef's table, and it was just that. I told our waitress that we wanted the full experience. Instead of us choosing from the menu, we told the staff to make the decisions for us. They brought us between 5 and 6 dishes with the perfect variety. IT WAS AMAZING! Once I put something in my mouth, I didn't to swallow because I didn't want the taste to disappear. It was the ultimate combination and every plate we received was better than the last. Our server Jessica was extremely knowledgeable and gave us a brief but very descriptive explanation of each plate before we indulged! They also had the perfect amount of time in between courses, where it wasn't one after another, but we also weren't waiting around. I had very high expectations, and it met that plus more! I HIGHLY recommend Girl & The Goat, I don't see how you could go wrong! Cocktails were phenomenal as well.Thanks again!!"
"I mean, we had practically everything on the menu.The flavor combinations at Girl & the Goat are excellent. I ate things that I've never eaten before and didn't flinch, because the taste was just that good.Standouts? Veggies: The green.beans! In fish.sauce! With cashews! Dishes like this one make me remind myself to cook more things with fish sauce. Yum. And the cauliflower, with pine nuts. I don't even normally like cauliflower (think Newman's broccoli-induced ""vile weed!""), but with pine nuts and pickled peppers, it was great.Seafood: Soft shell crab w/ corn- yes please. Scallops were good, escargot was great, but the crab takes it.Meat: The beef tongue with a little masa cake was delicious. And the pig face patty (pig face? yes!) was very, very good. My favorite: the goat meat pizza. The cherry base and ricotta played with the smokiness of the goat meat. So so good.Skip the ham frites, they were standard. The sauces were good but if you didn't get a little bit of the ham shavings then it tasted like standard skinny fries.The dessert winner was the fudgsicle: chocolate square with olive oil gelato, and Dragons Breath beer poured over that. Amazing. ""F this is good"" was heard at my table.Our server was very nice and accommodating, the restaurant was physically beautiful, and yes I did gawk at Stephanie as she expedited the dishes."
"Girl and the Goat has great food which is unqiue in presentation and taste, however there's a little something missing and I can't figure out what. The service was nice too. We didn't make a reservation and got seated on the little side seating area in the front. A bit of advice though is arrive early if you don't have a reservation! By early, I mean when they open for dinner; 4:30PM sharp.As for the food, we had the pig's face, which was extremely unique.We also had the mussels with egg salad which were my faves and a few other veggie dishes like the beets and the green beans. We also ordered the two types of bread...apple Ginger and one other. Both were quite fresh and again, totally creative in taste. I would send friends here based on the originality factor, but I don't think I'll ever remember any of the foods particularly well or crave anything on the menu. Then again, Stephanie changes her menu up regularly, so who knows?"
"Best meal I've ever eaten. Â Fresh baked bread with artisan butter, oysters, pig face, goat liver mousse, beef tongue, hiramasa crudo with pork belly, and duck-fat fried doughnuts! Â There's a reason why Stephanie Izard won Top Chef."
"Exceptional dinner. Â Ambient atmosphere. Â Delightful espresso and desert to end the evening. Â And must I say, Veronica is the waitress you must request! Â She's excellent!"
"We sat at the bar and what a great environment. The bartenders were wonderful and mixed some delicious drinks, I am now in love with Chartreuse! Amazing escargot raviolis and even there side salad was good, just enough mix of lettuce and veggies and cheese. To finish they have an excellent goat cheese cheese cake that was just delicious."
"Nine months late but I still remember how delicious each and every one of the dishes taste. Definitely get the roasted cauliflower, grilled pork ribs, grilled octopus, sauteed green beans, and roasted pig face. I think the latter is a seasonal dish. Bring a group of friends so you can try everything. Also make reservations."
"I thought the meal was great, and about what I expected after reading all of the reviews. I would not recommend the pigs face, just thought it tasted like fat. Would definately recommend the scallops and the brocolli was fantastic. Our waitress was also awesome, and was tentative enough without being overbearing. Would definately return to this restaurant for a special occassion again."
"Could not have been better! Sat at the bar because we came in wearing our Blackhawk's jerseys following the game and weren't sure if we were exactly dressed appropriately for the restaurant's upscale ambiance. Â We started with the fried pickles and a glass of wine while we perused the rest of the menu to decide which shared plates to order. Service was perfect with good recommendations and a pre-warning that the plates would come out staggered so if we were over ordering in our post game feeding frenzy, we could cancel a plate or two. Â In the end, we did just that as the portions are more than ample and so the 4 plates we had ordered plus the Ghums & Roses (Rosemary) bread was just too much food for two people. Â We were completely satisfied with the roasted cauliflower (best cauliflower dish I've ever tasted) and the Divers Scallops (2 scallops, perfectly prepared). Â Will have to return to try the escargot ravioli and squash wonton that we cancelled. Â We cancelled 2 dishes to save room for a dessert and agreed to share the miso butterscotch budino. Â What a wonderful concoction of butterscotch pudding, glazed pineapple, candied cashews and bacon toffee. Â Absolutely wonderful! Â In the end we tried a liquor of Chartreuse, which I'd never heard of (google it if you don't know it - well worth knowing) - and fit right in in our Blackhawks garb with the fun and delightfully casual yet perfect atmosphere. Â Will definitely go back to this excellent restaurant - in fact, would consider returning to Chicago just to visit The Girl and the Goat!"
"Superb!! Its extremely difficult for any restaurant with a lot hype to meet expectations. Girl and the Goat met and exceeded them for me. First off, the best part about this place are the smells! The restaurant is very open with the kitchen/wood burning oven located in back and quite visible. The smells continually circulate. I can only imagine that the smells/environment will be even more intense during the winter months. On to the goodness, the food! The menu is divided into three parts: vegetarian, fish and meat. Each section having about 5-8 different options. They also have a menu with different specials as well. For me, there was a good balance of some very unique dishes and some very familiar tastes. We ended up ordering: -duck rice crepes-goat cheese pizza-pig face-scallops -potato fried dumpling dessert -rye bread that tastes like a Big MacEverything was absolutely amazing. My favorite was probably a toss up between the duck rice crepes and the pig face. The crepes were really interesting - a very crispy crepe with a slightly sweet duck. Love it! Â If you've been to Moto, it will remind you of the Cuban Cigar. The other key essentials to a great restaurant experience were all good. Service was friendly and attentive. Cost was competitive, and honestly, might be a bargain based on the quality. Decor/ambiance was inviting and warm. I've only been there once, but it already makes my list of top places in the city. A must visit."
Amazing. We got a table opening weekend and have been back a few times. The oysters are all great. The soft shell crab with corn is a must-try. The pig face sounds odd but tastes great!The grilled lamb ribs are ok... but I wouldn't order them again.I enjoyed the industrial/lodge style decor.Service is always top-notch.Make reservations WELL in advance if you don't want to eat before 5:30pm or after 9:00pm.
"Yummy :) Â The Girl and The Goat was everything I hoped. Â We, my husband and I, snuck in without a reservation after the Chicago Gourmet event.We had great people watching in the lounge including a very particular vegan who appeared happy with everything to super wasted wanna-be sex in the city of chicago crew that must have been en route to Chelsea Handler.Now to the good stuff...Drinks:Cocktails-excellent selection for boys and girlsWine list- delicious, we went with an italian sparkling, Ferrari and it was deliciousPost dinner cocktail - Aperol SpritzerFood:Pappardelle Ragout - the meat was unbelievable; i don't like pasta but the waitress recommended and it was the definite stand outShisito Peppers - fabulous flavor in the peppers as well as the prep, even the meat loving hubby liked this veggie dishstuffed calamari - ok, not the fav of the eveningcheese platter - stand out was some texas cheese that I had never heard of and it was of course the cheapest cheese on the menu so we had low expectationsBreads- we sampled the vegan neighbors selection and they were all deliciousHope to be back soon with a big group and larger appetites so that we can try more!"
"I can't really add any more than what others have already written. Everything on the menu is absolutely delicious. Here are a few stand-outs:- green beans- chick pea fritters- cauliflower- the sea scallops- any of the oysters- any of the dessertsI was very lucky and got a reservation for 6pm on a Saturday night through Open Table, the day of. Couldn't have picked a better spot for all of us. Everything was seasoned and cooked to absolute perfection!"
"Does this place REALLY need another good review? No, but here it goes anyway. Great service, cool locale, and here's a selection of what I ate:green beans Â - sounds boring, I know, but they rockedchickpeas fritters Â - definitely my favegrilled baby octopus - yum, but nothing out of the ordinaryscallops - these were a hit, but had veal, so I didn't tryskirt steak - this usually basic dish was very specialwood oven roasted pig face- I was skeptical, but loved it!whipped fat back w/ biscuits - I feel terrible that I loved this so much, sounds so unhealthy, but it was sooo goodolive oil ice cream thing - meh, but I was full and really didn't need dessert.But here's the caution: in case you've been living under a rock, this place is really popular. So, if you are in the mood for a quiet dinner, this is not your place. Also, I would recommend going with a group, not just one other person, and make sure that group is of adventurous eaters. You'll be able to try more things since it's small plates and the food isn't your basic steak and potatoes. You may end up loving the thing you weren't jazzed about ordering, but your buddy was."
"Steph Izard is the only female chef to ever win it all in the Top Chef Franchise. Â  We love to go to featured contestants restaurants on our trips. Â Girl and the goat had been on our list for awhile now. Â Do book in advance. Â I booked over a month in advance and i still couldn't get a table before 10:00 pm. Â Family style dining is how they serve their food at G&G, what may look like a cop out to some, worked fine with me. Â Our first dish was the sweet potato gratin, our server Tony recommended that we order it do to its popularity and taste. Â  It had so much flavour, i loved all the layers of sweet potatoes, and the crunchy onions that topped it were perfect. Â We also had the grilled octopus, goat cheese flat bread pizza and the pork ribs with slaw. Â I cant remember exactly but the ribs seemed to have an exotic sauce, it was not your standard BBQ, they were really great. Â For dessert we had a trio of their ice cream, they had great texture, and i really liked the pear.Overall G&G is a super trendy restaurant with outstanding food, incredible vibe, and really approachable service."

"I love tapas and I love Top Chef. Â So of course I was excited to try Girl and the Goat!We didn't have a reservation, so we knew we were pushing our luck trying to find a table at 7pm on a Friday. Â But the wait staff was super nice and let us have a seat at one of the party tables in the back (because the party wouldn't be arriving until later).We chilled yellow tomato soup (yum), oysters, grilled baby octopus, seared scallops, beef short ribs, and I believe duck hearts... All were delicious except the short ribs, which we felt were slightly overcooked. Â Also, we had the tobacco ice cream dessert which did not live up to expectations. All in all, a great night of great food.One complaint - the waiter seemed a little jittery (maybe because Stephanie was clearing each and every plate behind us and could hear him explain the menu to us). Â Still - pretty impressed to see Stephanie all night - and see that she personally ok'd the dishes. Â PS, I know someone who is friends with Stephanie and she LOVES taking pics with Top Chef fans. Â So don't be shy."
"I didnt want to love it . All the hype, all the build up. All the cool foodie people telling me they ordered the pigface (when I know its just shredded pork cheeks on a plate). But damn it Stephanie. I loved it. Â What I had....Kohlrabi salad- working on recreating this one. to easy, fresh, and delicious not to make at home.Beet it Bread with goat butter and walnut oil. Could have skipped it but it was still good.Skate- Effing awesome. The grapefruit just made this dish. omg. the sweet citrus just killed it.Goat empanadas. Worth every calorie. She marinated the goat cheese in a tangy vinegar sauce. genius.Duck tongues. Eh. not my favorite. but I have nothing to compare it to since I've never eaten duck tongues. Pork Ribs. Very good. Chocolate cake with thai chili. Man. My favorite of the night. sort of like chocolate cake with spicy rocky road ice cream, reeces pieces, and moose tracks all in one. best way to end a meal. all for $100. with two beers and a french pressed coffee to boot. Damn you Stephanie. I am now one of them. I'm gonna have to praise your name all over chicago like every other ""foodie"". Well done."
"We flew in from Florida earlier that day and got engaged...I made reservations earlier in the week and the fantastic young lady I spoke with managed to fit me in because of the special occasion. We were not disappointed! Everything we ordered on the menu was superb. We have both eaten in numerous restaurants all over the world and this was in the top five for us. The service was exceptional and even though the young lady that booked me a few days earlier was off, Â she apparently made sure the staff was aware of the special occasion. We were brought champagne and given a great table for two in the extremely busy restaurant. I was thoroughly impressed with the service and the food was equally outstanding. My biggest problem was narrowing down 4-5 things on the menu to order, everything sounded unique and delicious! I will advise to save room for the crispy pork shank, which after 3 other delicious dishes between my fiancee and I was difficult to finish but sinful to leave any left on the plate. What a dish!! I want to thank everyone at Girl & The Goat for a truly memorable experience, I will always make it a stop when in the beautiful city of Chicago. The only thing that would have made it better is to meet Stephanie but she was conducting a soft opening across the street...understandable and look forward to catching up with her next time!"
Literally one of the best meals I have ever had. I went there on a date so I cant speak much about the bill and what it took to get a RES Â but the food itself was AMAZING
"Had a wonderful dinner their last night. Â Great decor, service was fine, the aroma of the wood burning oven permeated the place in a nice way. Â The format is small plates. Four of us split several dishes. Â The dishes we had are listed below with rating;Beet Salad 3.5Squash Kohlrabi Salad 4.5Shrimp with Peanut Pork Ragu 3.5Goat Live Mousse w/crumpets 5 - the best dish of the night, and a large portion, you have to split this with at least 1 other personCrispy Pigface 3 - The protein was cooked to death and tasted almost like burnt bacon, not sure why this left the kitchenVeal and Escargot stew 3.5Bourbon Apples 2.5 Very boring and uninspired, needs more bourbon and textureSticky Date Pudding 3.5I personally could care less, but I'm sure many guests were disappointed.Great beer list, and I will return"
"I finished my meal and wanted to start all over again. Â If I had my own ground hogs day, I would wish it was a this restaurant. Everything was perfect in so many ways. Â I loved this meal and I wish I lived in chicago so I could go more often."
By far the best food in Chi-town .
I recently went back for my second visit to Girl and the Goat. This time I found that the food was every bit as good as the drinks and ambiance. Therefore I wanted to upgrade my rating.
"After all the hype I have been hearing about Girl and the Goat, my expectations for this place was high, and by high I mean really high. Â I am happy to say that it really did live up to its name. Â I liked the place from the moment I walked in. Â The room was dark, large, and inviting. Â And I love the open kitchen that allowed patrons to see all the line cooks do their thaaang. Â The food is served ""tapas style but it's American, not Spanish so portions are bigger,"" according to our waitress, who was an absolute peach. Â She was very helpful and and made some really awesome recommendations. Â Here's a rundown of what we had:*Squish Squash bread-really yummy. Â I thought the bread was complimentary when Â we were asked if we wanted bread. Â But it wasn't. Â No big deal though because the bread was delicious.*Raw Oysters-Delicious, as most raw oysters are.*Goat Belly Terrine-one of my unexpected favorites of the night.*Scallops-really good. Loved the slight hint of pomegranate.*Pig Face-AWESOME! But really salty.*Ham Frittes-another winner.It was a good amount of food for two people. Â We left feeling overstuffed. Â Girl and the Goat is reminiscent of one of my favorite restaurants: the Publican, only more it's ""trendy"" looking. Â Goat and pork take up a large portion of the menu, but there was also a good amount of seafood and veggies to choose from. Â A lot of the dishes we tried were very salty, but that's okay. I like salt. Â This is definitely a place I want to come back and try again. Â Compliments to the [Top] chef."
"Lives up to the hype. Â I waited a couple weeks for the hype to die down to tolerable levels; a 4:45pm or 10:15pm reservation were available on OpenTable. Â Glad to see they're extending hours a bit to let us all give it a shot. Â The staff was on top of everything and friendly, execution was smooth. Â Housemade bread with walnuts and other things entertained the others, while I ordered away at the more adventurous, the goat balls and escargot, They dived in to cauliflower and I, the beef tongue, etc. Â Everything was lightly crispy deliciousness. Â The kind of execution I'm used to at Blackbird.Two people, $100 bucks with tip; not bad for a solid culinary experience."
"AMAZING! The goat was to die for! The dessert was phenomenal! Service was excellent! Only bad part was that the restaurant was really loud, hard to have a conversation across the table! Definitely going back, but wouldn't go for great conversation (unless its about the food!).The early courses were light in flavor and body, but built on each other well for the main courses. Don't skip the goat course, it will blow your mind!"
"So I was very excited about going to this place because I am a Top Chef fan and I was rooting for Stephanie for the better part of her season. While I thoroughly enjoyed everything I ate I wasn't in love with the look of the place. It was very dark and didn't feel particularly welcoming...but I don't go to restaurants for the decor, I go for the eats!I don't know what I was expecting from the menu but it wasn't what I expected (if that makes sense). However it was delicious! I like the way the menu is divided: V (veggie) F (fish and other seafood) M (you guessed it...meat). The waitstaff was very attentive and helpful, which I think is always a good thing. Plus I got to see Stephanie at work, very cool!We had the chickpea fritters, hiramasa crudo, grilled seppia and grilled oysters. I have no complaints about anything we ate, except maybe that I had to share with my friends ;)**I recommend the hiramasa crudo (it was so nice, we had to order it twice) and the grilled seppia."
"Most delicious food I have ever had and it's reasonably priced. The menu is always changing but it's always delicious. Seriously, so good."
"I went to an art opening in the River West area with a friend on a Friday night and then wanted to eat in the neighborhood afterwards. We drove around and spotted Girl and Goat and I had heard from a friend that it was good, so we stopped in. We didn't have reservations, so we had to eat by a low coffee table sitting on a couch, but we didn't mind, and when the food came we were glad we stayed. The Kohlrabi Salad was to die for. I went back to look at their menu just now, but it changes, so I can't find the other dishes I had that were also scrumptious, but one was a goat dish and the other was a pork dish, both equally blew us away. The only thing that wasn't as impressive were the scallops because they were way too salty, and I love salt, but not that much. The waiters were fun and personable, but the only contention I might have with this place is that I wouldn't call their food healthy. Most things are loaded with butter, which gives the food such flavor, or things are often fried, but maybe for one night it is ok to indulge in the things that aren't heart healthy for just one night of heaven."
"I'm so looking forward to going to work tomorrow. Colleagues (or, even better, my boss) will ask ""How is your week going?"" Â I will respond ""I went to this AMAZING restaurant last night. The Girl and the Goat."" Â They will recognize this from sitting on their sofas, watching Top Chef on their flat screen TVs. Â And, guess what? Â This was my fourth visit to GatG! Â It takes around three months to get a reservation. Â I figure I've been there so often that I am super-important. When they do a sequel to American Psycho, I should play the lead and have GatG business cards (in bone white with little goats on them). Â  We got to dine in the pleasure of subdued lighting (with the warm blue glow of smart phones and the occasional flash photography: ""Facebook update: Look mum, I'm at GatG!"" Â Oh, I should mention the food. Â Yeah, it's pretty good. Â I liked the peppers and the flatbread. Â Oh, the skewered lamb heart was great (Clarice would have loved them). Â Maybe I'm getting old and grumpy, but the idea of sitting in (really close) proximity to lots of loud hipster white people (young hipsters, middle-age hipsters, and the occasional hipster granny) doesn't appeal to me all that much. Â I'll probably go back though."
"Four of us went to Girl & the Goat for a 10:15 Saturday evening reservation. We looked forward to it and upon arrival were greeted by a lively and diverse crowd. Despite the crowds, we were seated within 5 minutes of our actual reservation time.Service was quick and efficient. Our server was knowledgeable and friendly. Food was really tasty. We ordered the bread with the beer cheese sauce (delish!), chickpea fritters (so good we ordered them again toward the end of the meal), oysters (husband and friend loved them), sweet breads (again - everyone else but me ate them and raved), pork ribs (meat was tender and succulent), green beans (a wee bit undercooked but delicious nonetheless), cauliflower (great flavor) , sweet potato gratin (mmmmmmm) and the scallops (in a nice broth but only two in the dish. For dessert, Â we had the chocolate dish and the sesame semifreddo. I felt the desserts were fine but definitely not the highlight of the meal. All in all, the meal was good and I would return with a group of people. Great atmosphere and really fun environment. Give it a try! I do not think you will disappointed! Cost: $320 total with tip but that included a few cocktails and wine."
"I went to G&G early yesterday evening (before 6 pm), and thought that getting a table without a reservation would be easy. Â The place was packed, which speaks to how good the restaurant / food is. Â I would like to use the review to comment on how helpful the hostess was. Â She worked hard to find me a place at the bar, because she did not want me to miss out on the great dining experience. Â I am thankful that I had her help, my dinner was delicious! Â Both the food and staff are amazing, though I definitely recommend making a reservation."
"I am not that familiar with top chef, but i heard about this restaurant through an old friend that wanted to eat there as I visited Chicago (my old stomping grounds) last weekend. Â We had reservation for a Friday night, they sat us right away and a cheerful waiter greeted us to recommend drinks...The service was amazing. The waiter was constantly ""recommending"" things to order which my fellow friend loved even though I thought it was a tad bit pushy but overall the recs were great and we thouroughly enjoyed the food.We ordered and shared:Chickpea Fritters - yummyShishito Peppers (delish! - must try if you like peppers)Roasted Cauliflower (again, yum!)Seared ScallopsSkirt SteakChocoloco bread order..and I can't remember the name of this spectacular desert that was in a cup like thing and tasted very much like a layered creamcheese item which was a-ok with meWe also had about three drinks each (we are big drinkers) and those were amazing! I could have stayed there all night sipping cocktails post dinner.The ambiance is def. gastro pub and it was very noisy. My friend and I are pretty relaxed when around each other and we had to yell which was kinda uncomfortable but overall everything was nice and to our liking.I would recommend anyone to eat here if you can snag reservations. Bring an old friend in town, your hot new date or a group of sassy friends to enjoy a good meal in a fun and new environment.xx"
"I am a little late in writing this review, but all you have to do is take a look at the reviews and know that if you haven't had an opportunity to eat at Girl & the Goat, you need to make a reservation as soon as you can. Â The food is simply amazing and the overall restaurant experience matches the food. Â My sister and I went for dinner on June 2nd after waiting about a month and a half for our reservation (we got lucky). Â Every plate we had was an experience that we don't want to forget any time soon: Â the green beans, breads, chickpea fritters, seared scallops, wood fired razor clams, pork ribs, roasted beets - delicious! Â We LOVE Girl & the Goat. Â My only disappointment was that we couldn't stay there all night and try every dish on the menu. Â Stephanie Izard and her team did not disappoint Â in food or service. Â  Thank you for an amazing experience, Stephanie (and it was so great to meet you)!! Â  Did I say we loved Girl & the Goat?"
"SO GOOD!!! I've never seen top chef, but my friend made some reservations and we went. Â It was absolutely delicious! Â All together our party of 3 got 6 dishes and although we were nervous to get some of them (i.e pig face) I must say that I'm glad I tried it. Â We walked in, but seriously had to be rolled out because of all the food we had in our bellies!They had a butternut squash ravioli that was delicious and the scallops melted in your mouth (no joke, my mouth is salivating). Â I didn't really care for the ham frites, because they were so salty! But i mean what do you expect, it's ham and fries!! Â We also chose the biscuits with bacon fat, and although it may lead to a heart attack in the mere future, you must try it. Â The goat pizza... ehh, could have gone without but still good.The waitstaff was wonderful! Â They were so friendly and definitely made me feel like I wasn't an idiot because I didn't know what half the stuff was. Â Great food, without the stuffy service, a restaurant goer's dream!There were two things I somewhat disliked about the place but didn't put a damper to the experience was that it was too loud and the food was a bit salty. Â Then again, a lot of the foods we chose were pork so I didn't mind really."
"Now I know why this place has the wait it does! Â It was delicious and we already made a reservation for the Fall when we left last Saturday.I have a feeling this is the type of menu you cannot go wrong with but our faves of the night were the pork shank and the goat belly! SO GOOD. Â We also had the shito peppers and softshell crab-delicious as well! Â I recommend trying one of the warm breads with spreads, too.The foods are a bit heavier so go with the server's recommendations on the number of plates for the table.It was a bit loud because it was later on a Saturday but the place is set up so you can still feel cozy but your neighbors may be pretty close!Book in advance as much as possible but absolutely worth marking it on the calendar and committing to the reservation."
"I cannot believe that mine is the only negative review of this restaurant! We watch top chef religiously and were so excited to dine at a winner's restaurant, but, if ever there was a case of ""the emperors new clothes,"" this is it! Â The food was over seasoned and had too many ingredients per dish. It was very hard to distinguish the flavors as they all blended together. The service was good and the busboys constantly filled our water glasses, but the water was room temperature. At least, we didn't break the bank with the five dishes we ordered. Tom C. would tell Stephanie to pack up her knives!"
"Beef tongue, pig face, goat...? Â That's right Stephanie Izard is serving up some D-lish offal and some atypical fare - using the whole animal love it. Â G&G is borrowing a little from here and a little from there in Latin and Asian influence and presenting a very American twist to her dishes.The Food:Bread with liver butter, liver flavor is there but not overwhelming.Hiramasa and pork belly: yum perfect balance - the delicate raw fish with the salt and crunch from the pork belly.Beef tongue: first beef tongue, now won't be my last. Pickled vegetables brightened up this dish and achieved balance.Pig face: didn't do it for me but I'm not a fan of pigs feet either, just too gelatinous.The Desserts: All more savory than sweet. Corn nougat very unexpected think creamed corn with a street vendor corn.Service was very warm and over the top. Loved the vibe, great food, will be back."
"We went to a play Saturday afternoon and afterwards decided to take a chance at the Girl and the Goat and see if we could get seated anywhere. Â After one drink we lucked into a spot at the bar and what followed was all very good. Â We had the ham frites, cauliflower, the crudo, oysters rockerfeller style, the beef tongue, the scallops, lamb stuffed calimari, and the sesame semi-freddo. Â All of it was worth having again. Â The wine selection was pretty good as well.The service was very good at the bar and everyone was very nice, including ""The Girl"", Stephanie Izzard.This is the type of place that will always be on our list and we will frequent more in the future."
"I waited 2 months for reservations, but the wait was well worth it!Opening with scrumptious bread and blue cheese whipped butter was just a hint at the rest of the goodness to come. The shaved kohlrabi salad was so full of flavor, the sauteed green beans were perfectly crunchy, and the chickpea fritters were just right. The seppia and scallops were just as amazing, and the token goal dish (masala pizza) lived up to the hype.All in all, I will wait another 2 months to go back, and enjoy not only great food but some people watching (Rahm Emanuel dined one table over, and Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan stopped by as well)"
"There is ABSOLUTELY nothing I can say that hasn't been said. Â Simply put, this restaurant is unbelievable. Â The food creations, flavors, service, personality and wait staff are aces. Â Every bite was a festival in my mouth. Â This restaurant deserves bucket list status for anyone who truly enjoys trying different, complex yet simple, tapas style plates that span the globe in their tastes and construction."
"Let me tell you . . . I dream about this place all the time.We came here on a trip to Chicago a few weeks back. I've heard great things about this place and was expecting a lot. When I expect a lot from a restaurant, it usually never delivers. Well, let me tell you - this place delivered.Of course, we had to get the pig face but we didn't know what else to get so we decided to ask our hostess. She was very outgoing and kind and told us all her favorites, described each plate, and then told us what the top ""sellers"" were. We decided to go with the MusselPig FaceGoat BellyShankDiver scallopslamb ribsroasted cauliflowerand let me tell you... OMG. My two favorites were the mussel and the pig face. The mussel was fat and the sauce was just divine. It came with coutons, which were perfect because we used it to dip into the sauce. It was heaven in my mouth. Do yourself a favor and PLEASE GET IT. It was seriously the best mussels I've ever tasted. I never knew mussels could take this good. My bf who isn't a big fan of mussels (never eats them) decided to give them a try and one bite and he was hooked!Next came the pig face with the perfectly cooked egg on top. In between the egg and what I assume is the pig face, there's a layer of crunchy hashbrowns. Again, my bf isn't a big fan of raw eggs but decided to give this a try. To this day, he cannot stop waiving about this. It was creamy, crunchy, salty, and full of flavor. The combination of texture was just divine. One plate of it wasn't even and we wanted to get more, but decided that we still had many courses to go. But the pig face was by far one of the best things I have ever ate.Everything else was really good. I'd skip the cauliflower and the lamb ribs next time just because they weren't very unique. The cauliflower was actually very salty and though it was still good, I wouldn't waste my stomach on it. The diver scallops were perfectly cooked and the goat belly comes with lobster and crab. All very delicious.For dessert, we ordered the chocolate chili something and I forgot the other dish. Since I forgot the names, it is pretty safe to say that the desserts were just okay. if I could redo this again, I would save the $16 spent on the two desserts and go with another round of the pig face or the mussels."
"My wife and I went to Girl and the Goat last night for our anniversary, and we were not disappointed. The only reservation we could get was at 4:45, so when we walked in the place was only just starting to fill up. By the time we left at 6:30 or so, it was jammed (get a reservation unless you're feeling lucky). The decor, music, and general ambiance are all great - we felt like we were going to have a good time from the moment we walked in. I started with a draft beer from local brewer, Two Brothers. Something to note is that all the beers on tap, at least when I went, were all locally produced in the Chicago-land/Northwest Indiana region. Their bottled beer list was extensive as well. The cocktail list looked interesting as did the wine list. I would expect those going to have a few cocktails wouldn't be disappointed. Cocktails were each about $12, while beers were each about $7. I didn't examine the wine list much, but it was rather large. On to the meal: Dishes are served tapas/family style at Girl and the Goat. As recommended by our server, we ordered 2-3 plates per person (we left stuffed). My wife and I ordered the sauteed green beans, chickpea fritters, and the squash ravioli from the vegetable portion of the menu. The fritters were the standout for us here-perfectly cooked, creamy, and seasoned fritters with bits of breaded chickpeas also in the bowl. The ravioli was delicious, and those that enjoy mushroom would enjoy the sauce accompanying the ravioli. The green beans, while heralded on yelp, we're not my favorite partially due to the fact that they were served last. From the meat and fish portion we ordered the hamachi crudo, which was a great somewhat light start to the meal. The pork belly accompanying the hamachi was delicious. We also had the goat, pork, and veal sugo - if I could eat this dish the rest of my life, I would be a happy man. Suggestions: definitely start the meal with at least one of the homemade breads (we had the squish squash) and get at least one of the desserts to finish - we had the bourbon apples, which had a great maple fat gelato from Chicago based Black Dog Gelato. This place is definitely an experience especially if you are a fan of Stephanie Izzard. She is very visible - expediting food looking at each dish carefully before it is sent out. Stephanie appears to be approachable as well shaking hands and talking to the few people that approached her. Our experience was great from start to finish, and Girl and the Goat is definitely a place we will be returning to in the future."
"Made a last minute reservation through OpenTable. Availability at 10:30PM! Whee! Anyway, we arrived and it was packed! We had high hopes because of watching Top Chef. We were not disappointed. The service was great, relaxed, not pretentious. The menu was pretty easy to follow. Prices were pretty typical. Family style eating. Lots of game meats. Yum. We had the roasted beets with avocado creme fraiche, sauteed skate, ham frittes, and pork with a kimchi sauce. It was so much food. It was all so good. We want to go back. We will next time we are in town. Bill came out to about $60/person."
"In town for the holidays, I was really excited to try this place (huge Top Chef nerd). Our table was ready right away, the place looks great, and my boyfriends Old Fashioned was delicious, so all was off to a good start. Then came the food, which was a complete let-down. The chickpea fritters were good, but not amazing. The scallops were also good, but the best part of the dish were the brussels sprouts. The pig face was interesting, and the first bite was tasty, but the mapley breakfast flavor got tired quickly. The skirt steak was the worst! Dry, chewy and the caramel sauce did not work at all. Really a letdown.I preferred the Publican, and I didn't love my meal there either. Bummer."
"We managed to sneak in yesterday at 6pm on 3hrs notice. It was a great dinner, worthy of the hype. Service was swift and dishes were awesome. The wife and I had 2 (tapas) each. They were bigger portions and we were stuffed!The goat pizza and lamb ribs really were good, along with the softshell crab. There are a few other dishes we'd like to try, so we'll be back!"
"If this place wasn't the new hot shiz, I would give it three stars. Â The service and waitstaff here were top notch. Â They are friendly, know the menu extremely well, and deliver your food with impeccable timing. Â The food on the other hand is forgettable. Â There's nothing I ate that I would want to order again. Â I thought the best part was the chicken soup bread and spreads. The lamb was tasty and the pig face was the best plate. Â I don't understand people making reservations three months in advance for this place. Â Come here right after working Monday-Thursday and you'll have a table within thirty minutes."
"I think I could eat at Girl and the Goat every day. The service was impeccable. Plates were small, but filling... and appropriately priced. Delicious."
"So why bother with writing a review for a place that has already captured that time and energy from 400+ other people? Â To tell you how it went when I brought the baby of course!Restaurant management has hired some of the most competent staff around and it shows in the hosts and the wait persons. On my first visit to G and G, I had a friend in from LA, my partner and my kid. Â We had a brief wait (I live on the spontaneity of life without reservations) and were seated at a great table, to which a high chair was immediately brought. Â The waiter was wonderfully nice in explaining the menu and was also very courteous of Â the fact we had brought a youngun. Wonderful wine, wonderful food and, as my partner in crime remarked, a pretty damn good value for everything we'd had...And he rarely says something like that.Our second visit to G and G was on Halloween and it was adults only. Â The wait was pretty lengthy and I was wearing hella-high heels so we grabbed the first available seats at the bar. Â While many have commented positively on the decor at G and G, I think the bar with its found wrought iron pieces is really the standout. Â Not only that, but as the gent and I quickly discovered, it is a pretty fun spot to eat your dinner. Even when the host let us know our table was ready, we opted to stay put and keep ordering. Yeah, that was quite the alcohol bill, but the bartenders are friendly as can be and mix a great Sidecar.Standouts in terms of food include Goat, Pork and Veal Sugo, Sauteed Green Beans with Fish Sauce Vinaigrette and some fab fried oysters that were on special on Halloween. I'd say more about the food, but I think that's a gimme in an establishment like this. Â The winning over for G and G is done through great and knowledgeable staff, a warm and welcoming interior and the ability to be somewhere cool without having to be cool (I mean for others, because, of course, I'm extremely cool)."
"This place was near hotel and I had a shot of vodka called ""Deaths Door"" how cool is that...My Crime Partner wanted a food product called Pig Face..sounds like a villain in a Batman movie..not cool.. Seemed a lil dressy.."
"Of course I ordered the pig face, and who wouldn't? It sounds a bit intimidating, but it was certainly delicious. Everything we ate from the pig face to the green beans was scrumptious. The mayor elect was sitting a few seats away and it looked as though he was also enjoying the ambience and yummy food, too! Ratings-Food- 5 StarsAmbiance- 5 StarsCustomer Service- 5 StarsPrice- Expensive, but well worth it!I love this place!"
"The dining area is very cool and trendy. The server was initially great, always coming by to top off the wine...then we ordered the second bottle and the visits became less. He was very knowledgable about the menu and offering suggestions. He recommended 2 dishes per person, I would argue you don't need that many and I wish we hadn't ordered so much. The food was very Asian inspired and good but as others have pointed out pretty fatty and salty. They are probably a 3.5 but since I can't rate that I will round up for the service. I wouldn't come back as it was good but not super memorable."
"My boyfriend and I dined here about 3 weeks after they had opened, and were super excited about it.Everything we had heard was positive, and it majorly lived up to the hype! Â Even the bread and butter is phenom! (foie butter?!) Â Both of us are in the industry, so we really know how to dine out! Â We ordered half the menu and thankfully our server was impressed instead of telling us to stop because we were ordering too much! (Ahem, attn: PUBLICAN's waitstaff...)Every course was wonderful and timed out very well, our server was very friendly and helpful, and not even too busy to small talk a bit.Towards the end of our meal our server came to tell us that unfortunately we would not be receiving the Pig Face we had ordered because Chef Izzard (love!) was not happy with how it was coming out of the kitchen. Â That may have been the case, or maybe they just ran out. Â Either way we were definitely disappointed.They were nice enough to send us out a couple of desserts to make up for the Pig Face. Â They were delicious! Â Eerily reminded us of a couple of desserts at our restaurant, but better! Â We left very full, happy, and felt that we got our money's worth at this scrumptious, unpretentious restaurant. (The floor manager was wearing Vans!)Will be back for the Pig Face! Â And everything else!"
"Not writing much anything else but that I think that this might be my new favorite experiential restaurant in Chicago.About a month late on writing this review, but went again and had to finally write something about this magical place of eating. You can't go wrong really with anything here...except that there needs to be more oysters that come with your order because they are so freakin' fresh and delicious! I'm also obsessed with the Goat Pizza. The ambiance is perfection for either a Tuesday Night Supper Club like I did with my girlfriends or date night, and the people and service are superb--especially for a new restaurant. Just be prepared to yell across to your friends if you're sitting at one of the massive tables...or just seat someone you don't really like or want to talk to in front of you."
"Very solid alllll around. Â Good location, great food, even better service. Â Went w/ a group of six so we sampled close to 15 different plates. Â Quick breakdown on the food:Thumbs up: GREEN BEANS!! Best thing on the menu, even for a meat eater. Â Sweet potato grautin. Â Chickpea fritters. Â Good beer menu for those who dig a more tasteful brew.Thumbs down: Â Breads. Â Simply put, dont like paying for bread, and the spreads were pretty average. Â Stuffed calamari also fell a bit short. Â Pricey (about $60 - 70/person with 1 drink each).Couple other quick notes... Two plates per person is plenty of food. Book reservations 2-3 weeks in advance. No need to valet, meter parking all around."
"While it's difficult to get a reservation at this place, it's well worth the wait! I heard that when this place first opened, they had an ""open call"" for servers and it's rumored that over 300 people showed up. Wowza!I can see why it was tapa style because I can' t imagine eating more than 3 bites of each tapa we got. Some of was too sweet, salty, buttery, but all in an oddly good way. You must get: Pig Face - it's not as scary as you think. You'd think you'd get crazy looking pig face on your table but that's not the case at all. Looks more like a sausage patty with a sunny side egg on top. The texture was crispy but not in the burnt bacon type of way. It was oddly sweet but delicious. I'd say - venture out and get it! Green Beans - if you don't like butter or almonds, don't get this. But if you do, it's a must. There also was a good tart, lemony flavor too which was delicious. Oysters - YES! Didn't try the fried oysters but the raw oysters were to die for! Skirt Steak - If you don't like pickled food, don't get this. It's not as creamy or buttery much like their other dishes. It was more like a pickly salad. Yum Yum. Cod Cheeks - Just forget that you're eating a face and get it. A little more buttery than I would have liked but don't pass it up. Dessert - got some sort of mud pie type of thing. It was a nice way to finish our meal."
"We LOVED this restaurant!!! Â Ratings:Food: A+Atmosphere: AService: A+ ; Very Knowledgable!!! Drinks: AValue: AOnly things I didn't like:-Had to make reservations FAR in advance. Â I understand why (cause it's awesome) but wish that people didn't know about this place. Â Our wait from the time that we got in (reservation at 7:15pm, got there at 7:00pm) was long (sat down at 7:30pm. Â Other than that, this place ranks in my top 5. Â We definitely plan on coming back and encourage people to check it out... er, I mean, don't go there so that I can get a better reservation ;)"
"One of the best meals of my life. Please eat here. You won't regret it. 4 of us pigged out on some of the most brilliant, soul satisfying yet innovative and creative food we'd ever had. And we all had a couple cocktails. And it was under $300. I mean. Come on. You MUST go."
"Always a wait for a reservation or a seat at the bar, but, take what you can get because it is worth it. The menu twists and turns depending on what the market and season have to offer, so, be prepared to be surprised and delighted by the culinary creations of the talented Stephanie Izard. Green beans are not just boring veggies with her at the helm. A few other specialities that may appear on your order are: sautÃ©ed skate wing, kohlrabi salad and wood oven roasted pig face. If you are ravenous and adventurous, you and seven of your friends can partake in the whole goat's leg. The servers have been put through significant training as evident from their detailed knowledge of the menu. Often, you will catch a glimpse of Chef/Owner Stephanie Izard on the line. If not, you can jump across the street to her newest babies...Little Goat Diner and Little Goat Bread."
"Went here with a group of 8 to celebrate a good friends birthday recently. Â Only 2 of us had been here before and we were all anticipating a fantastic experience. Â But when we examined the menu we couldn't really figure out what we would want to order as a group. Â Our waiter suggested a great option they offer where the Chef picks out your courses. Â We did that and additionally got a Goat Leg. Â We were not disappointed with any of the 10 to 12 dishes we tried at all, everyone had their favorites but no one had a bad thing to say about any of them. Â  If you have a group of 6+ I highly recommend trying the goat leg, it's 5lbs and $150, but worth every penny. Â It's served with delicious pita bread and 8 different sauces, and the meat is so perfectly cooked and falls right off the bone. Â The most enjoyable of the many great small plates we had was the pork belly, tuna, and jalapeno, such a unique combination that takes your palette on a journey in one bite, sweet from the hamachi, savory/salty from the pork belly and finishes with a little kick from the jalepeno. Â If you are looking for a couple of great vegetable options, try the green beans, and the cauliflower, both really impressed our group. Â In addition to the 10 to 12 dishes we tried, they gave us 3 deserts to the try, all 3 were great, but the chocolate cake was by far my favorite.The staff was more then accomodating, never leaving us waiting for a moment, and the Chef was nice enough to take a picture with our birthday girl and sign a bottle of the wine. Â If you are looking to try a great fresh cocktail, try the best of 3, it was Goose, Primm, mint, and cucs, really refreshing drink."
Not much left to say after 1.3K+ reviews except for the fact that my second visit to G&G was even better than the first. Â Everything on the menu is fantastic and the Pig Face is a must-have for us!!!
"One of the best meals I've had in Chicago. Â Go hungry and try as many dishes as possible. The little peppers, the salmon, the ribs, and the pork shank were definitely highlights. Â The only complaint I have is that the cocktails were Â sub-par. Apparently girl and goat has its own vintage, so I'd recommend that route."
"Went to this restaurant last night with the promise of it being ""the best food in Chicago."" Â Good food? Â Absolutely. Â The best? Â Maybe a bit exaggerated. Â Opening up my palette to a variety of interesting combinations (chicken, mint and watermelon) was undoubtedly an exciting and entertaining venture, but possibly a bit far out there considering the fact that I refuse to eat half of the items on the menu, like veal (an ingredient on an astonishing number of plates) or other small furry animals that many young children keep as pets.Despite my hesitations after reading the menu, the waiter was very accomodating to my fear of eating someone's pet bunny, Fluffy, and offered to put those ingredients on the side. Â I highly recommend the scallops (veal on the side, of course) and the escargot (hold the goat balls). Â Our waiter was very attentive and friendly, and very helpful in choosing items from the menu. Â We went on a Tuesday night and it was insanely packed, so make sure you book a reservation before showing up.Being a fan of Top Chef, the thing I was most excited about was the prospect of seeing Stephanie doing her thing in the kitchen. Â Although she was not back there cooking, she did end up dining at the table next to us shortly after we sat down, which was a great addition to the meal! Â All-in-all, a great experience with great food and great wine!"
"I'll be honest, I was afraid I was going to have to eat pigs face and goats paws and not like this place. WRONG. They have veg and fish also. Everything was del-ish. We shared plates among 4 people and tried a lot of items. The chickpea dish was so tasty, hell everything was tasty. The service was top notch and staff was super friendly. I would def. go back again and again. Love the open atmosphere and visible kitchen. The little bebe goats on the napkins are too cute!"
"Worth the wait! My two favorites: pork shank and the goat empanada. I'm not even a fan of pork, but the pork shank was so tender and so well seasoned that not even I could find anything negative to say. It also came with a side of tasty na'an. The plates here are very very small. If we had not ordered the shank, my husband would have complained that he was still hungry. Â This is definitely worth it. And as for the goat empanada, this is the signature item, you can't come here and not order it. I would also give props to the pig face."
"This place rocked. The food was excellent and interesting, and the service was flawless. They even have a great sound track running that added to the ambiance. Great spot."
"all that needs to be said is ""Pig Face""! Me and a Friend from Korea who was in town grabbed some dinner on the fly cause I bumped into him walking around my office...i picked Girl & The goat cause I'd been trying to get there for a while... and Â we both agreed it was well worth it..First. the price...well worth it, and to be honest for what I'm eating and the love that goes into every dish right down to the house salad, I'd pay more. for the tow of us with 2 drinks each Â and 7 dishes we only paid 155.00 be for tip. it's a steal! (don't go raising prices cause I said that.)Second. real bartenders that know how to make real drinks. I'm simple man...mostly, so and Old Fashion is one of my favorite drinks, and I can't tell you how often it gets jacked, They got it right, the best I've ever had.Third. the dishes, phenom!!! scallops in duck confiet & Pigface were my top tow favorites so far from what I've had.we shared: Pigface topped with sunny side up egg, roasted pig shank w/ Cheddar flat bread & cold smoked kimchi, Fried soft shell crab which was Â to me a lovely twist to Mexican shrimp soup with Thai chillies instead of Mexican, two large perfectly cooked scallops braised in duck confiet atop shredded duck breast, kohlrabi salad (which I was informed is in the cabbage family even though it looked like the love child of a Asian pear & chimoia but didn't have the cabbage taste to it...), sauteed green beans with a fish based vinaigrette which was my friends favorite & the hiramsa crudo w/ fried bits of pork belly on top... we didn't make it to dessert even though they looked delightful... sizes of dishes a rightly proportioned so if alone a couple will suffice, or to shared be several people.Fourth. Interior... combo of rustic, Irish pub and industrial loft. favorite spot is being seated at either end of the cooking line at the kitchen... honestly the best spot in the house.. at least for me. I'm a foodie & a home chef, so seeing the effort that went into each dish prepared right down to the baking of the bread... many thanks & love to Maryann, Matt & Paul who entertained us while we ate & they worked & many thanks to our Waiter John(i think) who served us and arranged the order of which dishes would be brought to us so as to compliment our pallets.. stating off with the sweet (Hiramasa crudo) moving gradually to the salty end (Pigface). & many thanks to the hostess who sat the two of us at the kitchen line, that made the evening for us.will be returning with room for desert. I'm uploading photos which will not bring true justice to the dishes... but it's all I got."
"Totally lives up to the hype and now one of my new favorites in the city. This was seriously one of the best experiences with the best food I have ever had. I was able to randomly look and snag a reservation through OpenTable just the night before for my boyfriend and I and when we got to the restaurant we didn't have to wait AND were seated at a tasting table right by the kitchen. We were able to talk to some of the chefs and get little free samples of some of the food. Needless to say, everything was delicious. We each had a cocktail and for food we had the beet salad (so fresh), green beans with fish sauce (very unique and never had anything like it, so good!), trout (light with great flavor), and pork shank (PHENOMENAL, must try) with tasting samples of the chickpea fritters Â and roasted cauliflower. Needless to say, we were pleasantly full! and even with all that, it was a little over $100. The service was great and I loved the tasting table and I will go back numerous times!"
"The wait is well worth it. Â I spent my 40th birthday party here and I must say it was incredible. Â Great job Stephanie Izard. Â We didn't really hae a plan other than to eat, so we just ordered many things off the menu. The foccacia breads were all amazing (esp. Mushroom). Â The fennel salad was so good I think the 6 of us wound up ordering 5 of them. We had the roasted cauliflower, green beans, the scallops, the octopus, the crisp pork belly, goat belly, pork ribs and chicken. Dish after dish was better than the other. Â  I had some really picky eaters in my groups so I was really nervous bringing them, however the entire group loved it. BTW the prices aren't very high. We ate and drank without recourse but the bill was surprisingly lower than I anticipated. Make your rez today. This is a restaurant not to be missed."
"Finally got to try Girl & the Goat! Â We made reservations so long ago, that I actually forgot we were going until I got the reminder call! Â Overall, I thought the food was delicious, though everything was extremely rich. Â The highlight for me was the fallcocia and onion jam. Â The bread was uctuously oily, and the jam was sweet and savory with a hint of rosemary. Â This is not to take away from the rest of the meal, it is simply to say that the bread and jam was really something special. Â A close second would the be fried naked cowboy oysters, with egg salad on top. Â I'm a huge egg salad fan, and this was particularly good egg salad that really highlighted the flavor of the fried oyster. Â The shishitos with parmesan and miso cream was also lovely, though richer than I expected a dish of peppers to be. Â I thought the sweet potato agnolotti were light and creamy, but the ratio of agnolotti to mushroom ragout was a bit low for me. Â The sweet and sour cod (minus the bacon) was light and crispy and creamy, one of my favorites as well.The ominvores I dined with thought that the escargot ravioli was one of the best things on the table. Â They were also quite happy with the duck tongues and the sugo pappardelle, but thought the goat belly was a little bit oily and actually overpowered the light and delicious seafood paired with it.In terms of ambiance, the place was fantastically hip and cozy. Â The large canvas on the west wall of the girl and the goat actually reminded me of art work I have in my house! Â The only complaints I had were that 1. the dishes didn't always lend themselves to sharing, and 2. the meal was rich upon rich upon rich with little to cleanse the palate in between. Â For the portions, some of them were easy to share, like the oysters and shishitos and the cod, but others were difficult because they were relatively small portions (like the agnolotti) or had only a small amount of condiment (like the goat belly). Â As for the richness, as mentioned above, every single dish we got was quite rich. Â Individually they were great (sometimes even better), but together I left feeling quite heavy. I think next time 2 dishes apiece will be enough. Â Then maybe I'll have room to try the desserts; they sounded delicious!"
"Food not good. That's pretty much all there is to it. Â I didn't read any other reviews on here before eating @ Girl&Goat but I'd heard from every other imaginable outlet that this place was nirvana... unfortunately I found the food to be quite disappointing.I would give the space, service, music and ambiance 4-5 stars no doubt about it. Â Great atmosphere and would be a fantastic place for a date with some drinks, but I probably would have to be paid to eat there again (which is sad, because I live down the street and would like nothing more than to be in love with this local spot)... I'd probably eat at Avec 100 times before I went back.The servers were really nice, and even let us bring some food to go for my ma and brother who couldn't make it with, but the overall food left much to be desired. Â Everything, including the butters with the bread were far too salty for my taste... this included squash ravioli, frites, and stuffed calamari. Â  We didn't have dessert, but even those sounded like they'd be way on the salty side (maple fat gelato??? c'mon)... I understand the whole themed menu and tying everything into the name, but at some point you just need to cut it with the NaCl... Won't be returning anytime I can forsee."
Wonderfully flavorful food but WAY too much salt. By the end of our 6 courses our mouths were burning with salty pain. We each drank about 7 glasses of water but nothing could cut the salt. All of the food was great quality and we will return with the explicit request to prepare our food with LOW SODIUM please.
"The napkins were terrible. Too much lint! If I hadn't had to track down a lint roller after dinner, I might give this 5 stars. But, alas, the lint."
"Worth the long wait! My fiancee' and I went to The Girl and the Goat for an early dinner and we were surprised by how many people were already inside of the restaurant at 5 o'clock. It was packed. Fortunately, we were able to get two seats at the bar before our 2 hour table wait We tried the chickpea fritters for a starter. LOVED it. Next, we tried the halibut. OMG, it was amazingly delicious. We enjoyed every bite. Trusting our Â bartender's recommendation, we got the braised short ribs with slaw. Very good. And, for dessert we tried the rubbard, lemon sorbet, with shortbread. Awesome. The service was great and the food was seriously good."
"I debated between 3 and 4 stars. Several of the dishes we tried were outstanding - and I have only been to this place once, so it's hard to judge overall. But with four people with a variety of tastes, we had a pretty good experience. The vegetable dishes were very good, although the famed cauliflower seemed oilier than necessary for good flavor. The biggest hit on our table was the lamb shank, which was rich and fabulous. My personal favorite dish was the red fish, which was lighter and very well balanced with lovely delicate flavors. The chocolate dessert with the truffle ice cream is really to die for - not too sweet, deep flavors.Timing is a big problem in this very busy, very large restaurant. Our server said that she would course out our order for us, but in fact the dishes arrived at an impossible pace. The table got very crowded, and we felt rushed. Then it was time to discuss dessert and coffee etc, and I ordered an espresso, which came in about a minute, while others were still pondering the dessert options. Surely the server could have held back on the espresso... maybe it's a small thing, but at these prices, I don't think the pacing should be so problematic.If we ever go back to this place, I think we will give the server some more specific instructions about pacing and see if that helps."
"I was debating whether to give Girl and the Goat five stars for its potential. And I believe this will be a five star, enduring restaurant. But it's not there yet, three-odd weeks after opening. You should go anyway, or wait a while and it will get even better (but maybe not less crowded).Stephanie Izard has upped the ante for the Randolph Street restaurant corridor and may be the new centerpiece of this eating district. Publican, take note!The highlights:-Soft shelled crab with a spicy corn and potato compote.-Friendly service in amusing t-shirts.-Appropriate decor.-Fast service, notwithstanding the overflow crowd (diners were served at the kitchen counter and at the waiting area).-Every one of the savory, creative desserts.-Even the french fries were unique (""ham frites""). Almost every dish was a unique and enjoyable creation.Downsides:-Charging for bread. I'm sorry, but no. Not a class move, even if it's good bread with foodie oil and butter.-Too noisy.-The reservations system and timing still has some kinks. We were seated 1/2 hour after our reservation time, but this will get worked out.-Totally tapas. A dining companion and I spent dinner griping about the tapas format (while savoring the food itself). I believe this trend has outlived its enjoyability, and many of the dishes here did not work as tapas (clams with fettucine? A piece of fish?) I was dining with five, which made it particularly hard. My advice: Tapas works here for two, but if you are more than that just order your own dishes. Maybe split a few as appetizers.I look forward to going back within a few months. This time, I'll order as a meal and hope the menu moves in that direction over time.Poor Stephanie could be seen the whole night trying to manage the kitchen line and the overwhelming flow of orders. But if her debut is any indication, she won't be ""poor"" at all very soon. I'd like to see her restaurant get to five stars, as it should. Bring an appetite and get to 809 West Randolph!"
"My two lady friends and I took adventure by the horns and decided to wait... WITHOUT a reservation... on a Wednesday. Â Big mistake.We spent nearly 2 hours at the bar waiting (arrived at 6:00), however our loooovely bartender, Josh I think, mixed and comped us some amazing drinks! Â (not sure if this was his idea to pacify us or if he was just stunned my how amazingly beautiful we are... haha). Â The food was F-A-B-U-L-O-U-S. We ordered 6 plates which was just a bit too much for the three of us. Â 1.5 per person would have been perfect. The seating is communal, so we made easy friends and even shared some dishes. Â Our waitress was smart and attentive (or well-advised) - could really tell we were starving without even asking. Â The price was very reasonable for the variety and quality~ $28 per person, I think.Summary = 1) great place to eat, but get a reservation if you are on a schedule or need to get up early the next day, 2) great place for drinks even if you aren't waiting for a table... you can also eat at the bar, I think. Cheers!"
"Had my birthday dinner at G&TG yesterday and it was FANTASTIC! Â Definitely my favorite restaurant in the city. Â Brennan was our server and was awesome. Â Try the sugo, pig face, green beans and scallops and you will be very happy you did!"
"this was one of the two amazing restaurants we tried while in Chicago for a conference. Â personal standouts: the sugo and the green beans (quite amazing with the fish sauce!). Â however, hands down the wood oven roasted pig face (as gross as that sounds) was AMAZING - best dish of the trip! Â i don't even eat egg and i absolutely loved this dish and wish i were stuffing my face with it now...sigh..."
"this was one of the best meals of my life. the portions were just right so you could order lots of different things and try out multiple dishes. my favorite thing of them all was the fried chickpea fritters, they were one of my all time favorite appetizers. unreal"
Go there NOW!Wow this was good... Everything on this menu from the bread they started with to each of the dishes was absolutely amazing... This has to be my number one in Chicago as of now - if i can get a table there again I will - if not i may just have to go back and wait at the bar (they newer take full reservations)...
"I am not giving Girl and the Goat 5 stars because I thought it was really good, I am giving it 5 stars because my visit here was truly the best restaurant/dining experience I have ever had in my life. This is in no way an exaggeration or overstatement.When we arrived at 6pm on a Friday with no reservation, my family and I were fully prepared to wait the 3 hours that was estimated until we could sit. We ordered drinks and lingered by the bar and began waiting. Being huge Top Chef fans and a devout Stephanie fan from the beginning, it was such a thrill to see her expoing at her own restaurant not 20 feet away from us! So exciting. After waiting a mere 45 minutes of our total 3 hour wait, the hostess approached us and excitedly told us that they had an opening and they could seat us right away. They were genuinely happy that they were able to help us out. The entire host stand was fantastic. Then we sat and our server was also wonderful. She assured us that she would be able to time when our dishes would come to the table perfectly, which she did. Not to mention, she was extremely knowledgeable and enthusiastic about the food. It says a lot when the wait staff can confidently stand behind the food that they are serving, and they are not simply giving you lip service.And of course, the food... Every single thing that we ordered was exceptional. Every bite was savory and satisfying, original, perfectly executed... all around phenomenal! The best dishes of the night were the wood fired walter's chicken, roasted pig face, chickpea fritters, and the scallops. Even relatively simple dishes like the ham frittes (french fries with ham salt) and the fried shishito peppers were absolutely heavenly. I'm telling you, everything was absolutely delicious!! I can't wait to eventually eat my way through this entire menu!Then, to top everything off, my mother and I could not resist being the typical adoring fans and had to meet and thank Stephanie for everything. She was extremely busy, yet when we approached her, she was so sweet; she calmly stayed and chatted with us about what we had ordered, her new restaurant opening, and how much we appreciate her work. I cannot stress enough how lovely she was. We even took a picture with her, and she made sure we all approved of the photo and we all looked ok before returning to her 50-odd tickets that she had temporarily abandoned. I am a Stephanie fan for life, and everyone should know just how much love she puts into her food and her restaurant. You can just tell how appreciative and warm she is towards her fans and patrons.Please check out this restaurant again and again, I know I will!"
Perfectly executed creative dishes. It was fun to sit at a table with strangers and talk about the tasty things they were eating. Â I want to go back and sit in those special seats facing the cooks.
"I have been 3 times, and was wowed each time. I haven't tried a dish I didn't like here. The pig face and scallops are to die for. Â Keep up the amazing job!"
"After all the hype we were finally able to get a reservations for this place at 4:45 in hurricane conditions outside. When we arrived they were nice and seated us, no worries there since it had just opened. As soon as we sat down were were greeted by our waitress who asked us what we wanted to drink. We had been there for less than 3 minutes. We told her we needed a few minutes. She came back in 2 minutes. We ordered a drink each and some bread. The bread was delicious. She was back in 2 minutes to ask us what we wanted to order on the menu of 30 items and were told that we had to order everything at one time and that she would course it out for us. . We told her we needed some time. She was back in 3 minutes. My point, it was so irritating that they were trying to get us out so quickly. They wanted to turn the table over so quickly that it was annoying. I get that you are busy but when you are going to drop 200.00 and you are rushed out of there in an hour, that is not a fun meal. On to the food. we ordered the cauliflower, exceptional. seared scallops, exceptional. red fish, okay. skirt steak, ok. pig face, awesome textures and flavors. donut dessert, not good.all in all the space is amazing and much bigger than i had anticipated. the service was not good, esp. because we were being rushed out of there. food was definitely a hit but the fact of the matter is it is not just about the food but the overall experience. i would go back but would wait till i got the later reservations so we weren't pushed so quickly."
"Meh. Â That's it. Â Meh. Â Sad, because I expected so much more. Â Girl and the Goat, like every new restaurant lately, is focused on primitive style food. Â I don't know if that is what everyone would call this trend...but I keep seeing pork, beef, vegetable, butcher style tables, jugs of wine....places like Purple Pig, The Publican etc. Â I love meat, so this is not a problem for me. Â What is a problem is when you start to dress up rustic cuisine. Â For example, we ordered the goat carppacio. Â If you order something like this, you must love meat and want to taste the goat. Â It's hard to do that when the goat is covered in fried onions and sauce. Â And this was my general feeling about the whole meal. Â Pig face? Â Sounds amazing! Â But it was just a pork tasting patty underneath sunnyside up eggs. Â Boo! Â I want the face...the whole face. Â We must have ordered 6 small plates and each one was good, but not what the hype is suggesting. Â I would much rather go to Purple Pig where I know the menu will be more satisfying.On the other hand, the cocktails were off the chain, the service was outstanding, and the ambiance (although loud) was fun and vibrant. Â The food was just ok. Â No fault of Stephanie Izzard, but with so much of the same cuisine in town, you need to step up the game. Â I admire her work, but in this town...people have done what you are doing for a few years now.We left without dessert. Â After six plates, if nothing is impressive, why stick around for dessert?To wrap up: Â I'd go back for a cocktails and an app...but for dinner, no thanks."
"I went for a birthday dinner. I read so many good reviews and was ready for the experience. I didn't quite know what to order bc the appetizers weren't the regulars. I went with roasted cauliflower and it was delicious, most of the dishes included pork. We were seated in the waiting area where you sit and can actually dine at bc of the wait. I didn't have reservations so the wait was about a hour which went by fast while eating and chatting with other couples. I asked for the entree menu bc I thought they would offer more seeing everything looked confusing and foreign but the menu is very limited and everything is Tapas and shared. We decided to have dinner elsewhere bc i knew I would be hungry afterwards. Â Overall nice place and good experience. oh yeah we also had the beef short ribs good also."
"My boyfriend waited 3 months for reservations, and we went last monday evening. The flavors and presentation were very appetizing! I really enjoyed our time. My favorite had to be the Pig Face and the ChickPea Fritters, yum yum! I wish we could of tried more! I wanted to take a picture with Chef Stefanie because I am a top chef fan, but ya... my boyfriend didnt like the idea so boo! haha great time over all. Our waitress was very helpful as well, and the wine selection was awesome!"
"Definitely worth the hype. I made a reservation for my birthday dinner two months in advance and was concerned because I'd heard you still had to wait even if you had a reservation. Not so. We were seated immediately. They put us at a table looking into the kitchen, which I was put off by at first, but it ended up being really cool -- we talked to some of the cooks and Stephanie Izzard was next to us the whole time.And now the food -- having been to the Publican the night before, we knew not to overdo it on the ordering, so we started with a beet salad that was fantastic. Then we moved onto the smoked goat and goat cheese pizza, which is in the top five of things I've ever eaten. The goat was in strips (like pulled pork) and so tender and tasty. The goat cheese complemented it well and the greens on top made for a tasty addition. I would order this every day if I could. We finished with a lamb shank that was so perfect it didn't need the tasty sides of olives, pita and fried onions, but we ate them anyway. For dessert we had the bourbon apples, which came in a mason jar with a cake bottom, cake crumbs, berries, gelato and creme freche. It was fantastic."
"with over 1,000+ reviews, let's get to the good stuff.things you should order:bread with house made butter & beer cheese spread (or any bread)hiramasa crudo (pork belly)pig facecheese filled donuts, served with apples & ice creamthings you could skip:wiley point oystersgoat chorizo pizzafirst things first, do not skip one of the bread dishes. the bread came out piping hot; me & my date wondered why the butter & cheese spread came in such generous sized dishes. who would use that much butter & spread on a little loaf? after one bite, we realized why. possibly the best regular butter i've ever had -- smooth & salty. and the cheese spread... was on another level. for a second, we entertained the idea of ordering more.i heard mixed reviews on the oysters, but decided to order them anyway. our four wiley points came out very warm (not a fan) & i could only taste bacon. skip this.lots of recommendations to try the hiramasa crudo (pork belly) & it was easy to see why. served over a white fish, this dish was clean, yet flavorful, and, as my date remarked ""top chef level."" our second favorite of the night.the goat chorizo flatbread didn't make me jump out of my seat, although it was the largest & most filling dish we tried. for me, the apple-slaw type mixture on top all over. this is something i didn't finish in favor of other dishes & wouldn't order again.the winner of the evening: roasted pig face. yes, pig face. presented beautifully with a sunny side egg on top, it's recommended you completely destroy the dish by mixing everything up, so you can capture all of the sweet & salty elements at once. the face itself is a little on the fatty side, giving it a very sweet flavor -- balanced by the salty potato sticks & cilantro. my date was blown away, & exclaimed it was possibly the best thing he has ever eaten.we felt obligated to order a vegetable side, & settled on the sweet potato gratin. it was shaved extremely thinly & then placed in a ceramic bowl, baked & topped with onion straws. i didn't taste the blue cheese that was promised, but it didn't bring the dish down. my sweet potato standards are pretty high; this version is legit.we took our waitress's dessert recommendation & ordered the cheese filled donuts, served with apples & ice cream. another great example of sweet & salty living in one dish. don't skip dessert.with the above & two beers, the bill came to about $100 -- but since our reservations weren't until 9:30 we spent about $50 in the bar before we sat down. drinks were reasonably priced for the quality & booze-level ($11-$18.) service was on par.after a year & a half, reservations are still hard to get & it's easy to see why. girl & the goat lives up to the hype. it does not disappoint on any levels & i look forward to coming back (unfortunately no sooner than three months from now.) congrats, stephanie!"
"Okay, so their rating and stellar reputation doesn't need help from my little Yelp review, but I'm just going to give my recommendations for those trying to decide what to order:Beet It bread with goat cheese butter and honey vinaigretteShishito peppers - please get these. just do it.Cauliflower - as everyone says, they are THAT damn delicious. the banana peppers are a great, great addition.Broccoli - charred broccoli? I'm in.Braised goat empanadas - one of the top two dishes we tried last night. the hummus it's served with is amazing.Scallops - amazing broth. perfectly seasoned and cooked.Pig face - life-changer. Sounds odd, but anybody who is anybody needs to try this at least once. They're cooked to the point of being slightly crispy on the edges and tender and juicy in the middle. Make sure you break the yolk and mix it all up.Chocolate cake with thai chili chocolate gelato - omg. just order it. the gelato alone is amazing. Some additional pros:-Ambience is awesome-Love the menu design and the cute little goat that's on everything-Service is greatCons:-The manager is a little... creepy (not sure if that's the right word). He seemed like a nice enough person, although he wasn't talking to many people while we were there. He just kept skulking around the restaurant with his really loud boots, scowling at everything.-Service - I said it was great, which it is, but it's almost TOO much. They kept taking plates away before we were done and it felt like they were trying to rush us out of there so they could have the table. After last night, I definitely believe there is such a thing as TOO much service.Despite the cons, which aren't many, this place is definitely worth checking out at least once. I'm still thinking about that pig face dish and the empanadas!"
The food is pretty good but pretty salty and fatty (hence good). The atmosphere and quality match places much more expensive so for that they get 5.
"Girl and the Goat revives the Randolph Restaurant Row scene. From the moment we arrived, the front of house staff welcomed us, confirmed our table and seated us quickly. Our server, Jody, was enthusiastic about our first time dining at G&G and happily explained the menu options and specials. We were never rushed to make our dining selections. Unlike other small plate restaurants that bring out your choices in no particular order, the kitchen thoughtfully composes the meal and presents them almost as if you ordered it as a starter, entree, dessert. Some highlights of the meal: Culture Club bread, Fideos with mussels, clams, shrimp; Beet Salad with grean beans and avocado cream, pork ribs with a tomatillo slaw. Desserts: blood orange sorbet with pistachio crust. Definitely have plans to return soon!"
"yes, i am updating my review so that the world knows that i have now been to G&tG three times. Â yes, this still makes me feel very cool, whether or not it really is.the fall menu is fantastic. Â after 1100+ reviews, i don't think there is much more i can say, other than GET THE HAM FAT FRIES. Â that is all."
"Girl and the Goat definitely lived up to the hype! Had a 5:30 week night reservation, as that was the only way to get in with just a few weeks notice. Even at that time, the place was already bustling with patrons.Our server was great as he really seemed to care that we enjoy our dining experience. After many questions about our wine preferences, he was able to suggest one that we would have never picked, and we were all impressed with his suggestion!A run down of the dishes we tried, which were all great:Choco Loco BreadSauteed Green BeansChickpea FrittersSquash RavioliScallopsBarramundiSkirt SteakBeef TongueWe were a little hesitant to try the beef tongue, but were so glad that we did, after a little push from our server. My favorites were the green beans, ravioli and beef tongue!"
"I don't have words to describe the incredible meal I just experienced this evening. Â The service was impeccable (Marni, our server, was fantastic). Â The food was out of this world. Â We had the cauliflower, kohlrabi salad, scallops, black bass and shrimp ceviche. And, for dessert, the chocolate cake. Â Everything came out quick and...one by one, we finished each dish and looked forward to the next. Â We did not have a reservation but arrived at 6:00pm and were seated right away. Â Incredible meal....worth every penny. Â WE WILL BE BACK!!!!!!"
"Amazing experience!I was with a party of three,from arrival to departure the staff was friendly,and helpful.The food was insanely good,each dish was a party of flavors!Good mix of music also piping through the speakers,and the decor of restaurant is perfect!I will return,and I can't wait for next adventure!"
"I feel this post doesn't warrant much content. My recommendation is make reservations, and make them now. Everything at the G&G is amazing."
"The decor is unique and fun and doesn't take itself too seriously, the service was professionally amiable and the food was outstanding.The small portions graciously allow you to try several of the ingeniously inspired creations all very flavorful (thanks to a delightful array of fats to be sure) but most very well balanced with some surprising acids.Can't wait to go back and try some more."
"We got there at 10:00pm and was seated at 10:15pm. We've heard so many good things and really expected the best food. It was very crowded for a weekday (Tuesday night). We ordered the ham frites, bread with garlic oil, duck confit, sweet potato ragot, and a white fish dish (can't remember the name.) The food was overly seasoned, everything tasted super salty. The ham frites were okay, a medium basket of small cut fries that are tossed and cooked in pork (ham) fat. The bread was okay, nothing special, butter and oil the same. The sweet potato ragot with mushrooms, was really good, but again, so disappointing at how overseasoned and salty it was. There were only 5 small sweet potato filled pasta pockets inside and the rest were mushroom parts. The duck confit came out next, the duck itself was great, but everything else that was thrown into the dish killed it with the onion strings and again (overly seasoned). We also had a fish dish which was a battered white fish with ham and jam, the fish was cooked perfectly but the batter around it was salty. The waiter was okay, it was pretty obvious he was trying to upsell everything, including the liquor, its his job, but was a little annoying. Not sure if we'd go back again. It was really disappointing, we see so many people on Yelp that absolutely love this place and we wish we felt the same."
"It can take forever to get a reservation (weeks, and sometime months depending on the size of your party and the time you prefer). So, call early! It's totally worth the wait though!!!! It is $$$. But the food is amazing, and the staff is edgy and friendly. I'm a vegetarian and found that the restaurant was extremely accommodating in providing me with many tasty options. I enjoyed my first experience so much that I immediately made a Â reservation to go again."
"The service is always top notch, cocktails and wine list are great...and the food...the food! Overall, a great value too!"
"I had the most delicious dinner at Girl and the Goat last evening.We were a table of four so we ordered plenty of dishes to share. The food was remarkable. From delicious breads to tasty vegetables and perfectly cooked meats, this was a treat from start to finish.The service was excellent at the bar and at the table and the bill was very reasonable for what we had. Just be warned that it is a big restaurant and is pretty loud so it's not quite right for an intimate dinner (at least not on a Saturday night).This restaurant is owned by top chef winner Stephanie Izard who was expediting at the kitchen and very gracious when we spoke with her. I would highly recommend this restaurant."
"We ordered a variety of dishes, but I felt I wasn't able to get the full experience since we didn't have a big party to share some of the more sizable dishes. Â We had the escargot ravioli which was not bad, it came with a nice sauce with crispy onions on top. Â We also had the grilled octopus which came out perfect. Â They grilled just enough while maintaining the tenderness of the meat itself and prevented it becoming too chewy. Â We also had the goat belly. Â It was my first time trying goat so wasn't sure if it was the sauce or if the actual taste of a goat that I couldn't get over. Â I was kind of expecting it to be similar to lamb? Â Anyhow, the dessert was fabulous, we had the sticky date cake. Â It wasn't too rich and the softness of the date was beautifully contrast by the rice crispiness mixed in. Â Finally, it was nicely topped with tartness of various berries. Â The service was great. Â They found out we were celebrating a special occasion and the server offered a compliment dish that was his favorite. Â I recommend this place if you get a chance. Â FYI, I recommend trying to get a resevation or it could be a long wait."
"Faboolous. I came here on a Tuesday night with a group of 6, perfect size to try a bite of almost everything on the menu. My favorites were the escargot with goat (meat)balls, and the kohlrabi salad, which I never would have thought to order. We tried all 4 desserts on the menu, they were surprisingly savory. The other favorite of the table was the scallops.I loved the interior, kind of a warm industrial look. It was loud and bustling for a weeknight. Stephanie was there with her back to the house, checking every dish as it went out. Our server was fantastic, you could tell she was really excited to be there."
"Crazy crazy good. We walked in at 5pm and the place was already hopping. The intent of eating off of all sides of the menu slipped away from us as we had our hand crafted drinks and were served our first order of the beets.... if you have not had them and have not been here, I simply cannot help you. If you ""don't like beets"" well that is just too bad for you. Next came the green beans, thank goodness we ordered them at the same time as the beets otherwise I would have asked for more beets and would have missed out on the green beans .. I can still taste them. After the green beans the intent was to move on to meat courses but next was cauliflower.. (sharing with another person on all of this was fantastic, great company but also perfect sizes for 2!) cauliflower... oh how I love thee. Then scallops.. now they were good, even amazing but they did not pair with the rest of what we had, the pumpkin made them a bit too sweet but it is still 5 stars because i say that is our fault for pairing the scallops with our other dishes and had we ordered the scallops on their own it would have been fantastic. I cannot wait to come to chicago again just so i can go back and order more yummy yummy girl and the goat. Well played."
"I've been here a couple of times now and I really like it. The first time we went, the hostess forgot about us, but I was expecting to wait a long time anyway, so it wasn't too bad. We ended up sitting at the table in the back that faces the kitchen. I'm still undecided as to whether this is the best or worst table in the house. Its awesome to see them make everything, the kitchen sends extra food out to try, but the smoke was hurting my eyes so much that we left before dessert.The second time we went was with a large group. It was a much better experience, because we were able to try a lot more. Our server was amazing. Probably one of the best servers I've ever had. We let him choose the menu and his selections were fantastic. He even recommended Au Cheval for a drink across the street after dinner. That was a great place as well. This restaurant is a MUST in Chicago. I am obsessed with the Kohlrabi Salad."
"Excellent. Great food, great service, great ambiance. Get the pig face."
"So glad to finally get to try this place, even if the only reservation we could get was at 9:45 on a Monday night! Still crowded, of course, with a nice atmosphere and a more open floor plan than you often see in West Loop restaurants. Walked in, looked at the menu, automatically drawn to the ""F"" (fish) and ""M"" (meat) columns. But, in service of my five-a-day, we thought we should balance it out and get a few plates from each of the categories, including the vegetarian plates and some nice west coast oysters. So glad we did. All of it was good--we really liked the beef tongue/masa dish and the calamari, as well as the chocolate cake-y/shiitake mushroom gelato combo we had for dessert--but I actually think the biggest revelation on the menu were the green beans. Fabulous, wonderful green beans! With fish sauce vinaigrette! Never heard of/thought of fish sauce vinaigrette before--but what a great idea, and really beautifully executed. This is definitely one of the reasons I like to go out to eat: not just to eat something good, but to get something that is elegant and creative and simple, yet blows your socks off at the same time. Big thumbs up. Now to find a knock-off recipe somewhere online . . ."
"Made reservations for this place back in early October, 2 months beforehand, and was lucky enough to grab the only reservation left for last Saturday night.The place has a very rustic and comfortable ambience. Â The tables, which are large and wooden are awesome for sharing plates--you never feel cluttered. Â The tables themselves are pretty close together, but I found that everyone was chatting with their neighbors and sharing food recommendations. Â Probably not the best restaurant if you need to have a private conversation though.The service was EXCELLENT. Â Shout out to our waiter, Patrick, who was knowledgable and attentive, one of the best servers I can remember having anywhere. Â We took him up on all of his recommended plates and we're disappointed. Â One thing I would say is that you should trust your waiter to bring your food out in the appropriate order. Â We requested certain plates first, and Patrick talked us out of it, advising that because of the heavy flavors, they were better eaten later in the dinner. Â We ordered all of our dishes at once, and he did a great job bringing spacing out the timing and bringing them out in an appropriate order.Our faves were the Sugo and the Squash Ravioli. Â My sister and I have both have been literally dreaming about them. Â Bottom line, I think this place is great. Â Wonderful atmosphere, great food, fresh ingredients and awesome service. Â I'll definitely be going back again."
"5 Stars for cuisine and atmosphere. Â 3 stars for somewhat shady service.I went to Girl & the Goat a few weeks ago after my boss recommended it. Â I was pleased, my friends were not. Â Upon walking in, there was an abundance of host staff at the desk - very overwhelming. Â I said hello and received some blank stares. One of the girls even gave my friend a dirty look. WHOA! I understand girl-fight, but hide it darling, you're at work!We received a bar table pretty quickly and ordered quite a few things including beer (great selection, by the way!). Â I loved the breads. Â They had three artisan breads to choose from, each paired with a very unique butter and oil. Â The butternut squash ravioli was also delicious, t'was a group favorite. Â I remember ordering a steak entree - it was... interesting. Â I wanted to try it because of the uncommon and bold flavor pairings, but the steak with the greens and salted caramel just didn't work for me.The part G&TG could improve on is having the servers hide their obvious up-selling. Â I work in sales and can detect a sales pitch instantly, I felt as if I was pressured to get more & more & more...I may return. Â The breads and beer is calling my name on a chilly evening."
Believe the hype. Get the scallops. Get the fritters. Get the 'face.
"I'll be the first to admit - I might be the farthest from a ""foodie"" as one can get. Sometimes I wonder why I write reviews when a cheeseburger makes me perfectly content.We went here, a group of ten, to celebrate a friend's birthday. It took over a month to get the reservation and there were only openings at 5:30p or 8p on a Wednesday night. Not used to going to such ""hot"" places, my stomach was not aware that we wouldn't actually be seated until 9pm with an 8pm reservation. It was a bummer to wait, but thank goodness for the bar and wine.We were seated at a larger wooden table directly by the ovens so we could see all the comings and goings of the waiters (whose shirts I might have liked more than the food). Our waiter was great. He gave us the paper menu - split into three categories: veggies, seafood and meat - and told us to mark down which dishes we want to try, knowing that we'd all be sharing each plate, a bit tapas style. I'm not a seafood eater so I can't speak to any of the fish dishes. I can tell you that the chickpea fritter-fried hummus veggie option was amazing. The tomatoes and mozzarella that were involved were weak, but the fried hummus made it worth it.The skirt steak wasn't great - too chewy. The ham frittes were, however, pretty much amazing and the two sauces they come with were both pretty much amazing.The pizza was too smoky and the smoke was the only taste you really got. Disappointing.Dessert: is the reason this place isn't getting more stars. I should warn you: I dislike goat cheese. a lot. So if you love it, then disregard that I hated the dessert. It was a weird crockpot of goat cheese and other stuff that I honestly didn't listen to because I tuned out after the waiter said there was goat cheese in a DESSERT. Give me chocolate anyday.Needless to say, it was a fun night, but really I could have been anywhere with these friends and it would have. I'm glad I've been to Girl & the Goat, but I'm also glad that I've been so I don't have to go back.If I do go back, I'd go with one other person or at least in a group no bigger than four."
"Didn't have a reservation - no problem, we sat in the lounge area and were treated like royalty.Great food! Â Was a little afraid to try all of the different goat dishes (because they seem to use it all!), but will be more adventurous next time now that I know everything that comes out of that kitchen is tasty! Â So you know - we had the green beans, warm marinated olives, oysters, flatbread, and more!"
"....i ate it all. i drank my entire drink, too."
"AMAZING!!!! Â I was in Chi-town for my partners birthday and they sat us at the Chef's Table to celebrate the special occasion. Â This was our first restaurant experience in Chicago after arriving and it set the bar so high that everything else we ate was sub-par (and we ate at some amazing places). Â The Cauliflower had so many layers of flavor and was simply delicious. Â They had these pickled peppers in them with mint and it really made it amazing. Â You think cauliflower...what could be so amazing about it? Â Well, we watched them prepare it from our chef's table and I tell you...there are sauces and layers of flavor that go into preparing it and it simply is divine! Â The Pig's face is also delish! Â Sounds kinda odd, but it's sooooo good! My fave for the night was the Sugo with the pappardelle pasta. Â Oh-My-God! Â So good. Â I don't think i've ever tasted gooseberries until this dish. Â That ragu was perfect! It was a party in my mouth! Â :) We got a few tasting dishes compliments of the house for our birthday celebration and we were simply STUFFED. Â I couldn't fit another morsel of food in me if I tried. Â I could go on and on about why I love this place!Let me just finish up by saying that the server and staff were simply THE BEST! Â They are so completely knowledgeable about all their dishes and how they are prepared! Â And they are soooo attentive! Â They even gave us restaurant recommendations for our stay in the city. Â If you can score a reservation, then YOU MUST GO to this restaurant when in Chicago. Â One of the most memorable dinner experiences I have ever had and I've eaten at some amazing places all over the world! Â Note: Â Pre-dinner cocktails could be had at RM Champagne bar which is around the corner. Â It is located down an alley and it simply adorable! You should go hit this place up before your dinner reservation at Girl & the Goat!"
"Finally made it here and it was worth the wait! Loved everything about it here.. atmosphere, music, artwork, tables... and of course the food! We ate probably 13 things and every single one was so great... stand outs: Octopus, Scallops and Pig Cheeks. Go with a group for sure.. and try everything you can!"
"Awesome place. Kinda pricey but the food is worth it. Got the calamari and the chorizo pizza, really great dishes. They had problems with our order so they gave us a free side dish. CHECK THIS PLACE OUT"
So good. So SO good.The food itself was great but I'm more impressed with the bar service. Â Ive been there on more than one occasion and i usually have amazing service. Â The bartenders Dennis and Joshua were waiting on me at my most Â recent visit...i adore them. funny and fast with great recommendations. Â I have never sat at a table because i always have so much fun at the bar. Â The cauliflower is amazing! love this place.
Very good place good dining experience.
"We thought it was great. Going back soon. Â We actually order too much that we couldn't fully enjoy the last couple plates. Â  Everything we had was amazing, especially the make your own goat gyro. You cant get a reservation anytime between 6:30-10pm normally but you can always just show up. We went there with my in laws, which was fun, but the place is loud. Â That being said, its not a place where you want to have in depth conversation but is definietly a fun atmosphere. Â  I need to look up what I had but the pork belly fish dish, the bread, and gyro dish are so good. Â They are heavy on the salt, but thats a good thing for me."
"We made our reservations four months in advance for our anniversary. We showed up right on time. The five person hostess stand greeted us and asked if we would like the chef table. We said, ""sure"" let's see what this is all about. We ended up in the corner of the place, in front of the kitchen, lots of commotion and the wait staff station on the other side. We decided to ask for another table. The new table that I waited for was directly behind the five person hostess stand. Waiting four months for the table, this was not my first choice. The waitor was really awesome! the bus boys were really nice. Our food was good but not enough. The most disappointing was $4.00 for a loaf of bread the size of my hand. We ordered four dishes including the bread and we left still feeling hungry. We had the green beans (delicious), Escargot ravioli's (okay), Shrimp (excellent), Duck leg (very good). My wine was about three sips for a hefty price.I watched top chef and I loved everything that Stefanie had always made. I was really hoping for a warmer environment and something a little bit more filling and at a better cost. Unfortunately, the average couple could not go here regulary on today's budget. Â The worse was when they called and confirmed our reservation they never asked if this was for anything special. I decided to tell the caller that it was our anniversary and she said they would make note of it. Nothing to be said when we were there. Would not be returning anytime soon."
Excellent food atmosphere service. I ordered about 7 things and they were all delicious. I will definitely be back here soon. They octopus was delightful and the pork shank was amazing. If I keep writing I will just repeat everything said below. Check it out!
"Anyone writing that this place isn't good for vegetarians obviously isn't seeing that 1/3 of the menu is dedicated entirely to vegetables. Most restaurants, you're lucky to get one item. Here you have SO much to choose from, and if you're a pescatarian, you're in even more luck. Most of the menu is vegetarian and pesca friendly. Our server asked us right away about having any dietary restrictions and then guided us wonderfully as to what items could be altered and what couldn't. The food was amazing. The service was so welcoming and informative without being condescending. Best items: the cauliflower and the shishito peppers. Crazy delicious."
Pig Face = 1 of the best bites of food I have ever had. Â That is all.
wonderful meal. they even gave us drink vouchers one night when we tried to walk in and they were closed for an event. would love to return!
"Talk about over rated! Â It was so frenetic in the restaurant you could not even enjoy each others company nor the food. Â Out of the 10-12 things we ordered, probably two of them were excellent. Â The ribs, string beans and many other dishes were so salty we could barely even eat them.The Pretzel bread rocked, but how can you go wrong with hot bread right out of the oven.We felt as if we were being rushed so they could flip the table (there were eight of us) for the next seating. Â SO NOT WORTH $800.00 that we spent!Chicago is home to some of the best, most enjoyable restaurants I don't understand why people would waste their money at Girl and the Goat.If you are all about the hot, trendy spot then I guess go ahead and waste your money !"
Everytime I come to G&TG its like a party in my mouth! Lol yes I said it! Food is orgasmic! Â Love this place!
"Hope I don't get run out of town for this. Ordered a dish with goat, crab, and shrimp. I'm pumped - it sounds delicious. Dish comes out smothered in an orange sauce. The sauce overpowers everything in the dish and tastes like an orange creamsicle. My waitress (who is really nice) asks if I like the dish. I say something like, ""yeah, it's okay."" She says, ""oh my God. That's my favorite dish here. I can tell you don't like it. Why?"" I tell her about the popsicle sauce. She laughs and says she has a plan.She brings me out a goat empanada on the house, which is really awesome of her. Sounds delicious! Sadly, the empanada is fried super deeply and is not very good. This time I hide it better and thank her profusely. Â  Â My wife and I split an another appetizer, which I can't remember. I'll probably try eating here again at the insistence of somebody. Maybe I'll fare better on round two. But I sure didn't like it the first time."
"With all the hype that this restaurant gets it was a little iffy going into dinner. After the experience all I can say is that the hype is actually a little underrated. Not only was the food absolutely amazing, the service was far better than I would have expected for a restaurant that has received the reception of this kind. It helped that upon arrival we were seated next to the kitchen and Stephanie was running the show. In my 4 years of living in Chicago this was my best overall experience yet. I couldn't recommend it more. P.S. There was not a mediocre dish that we tried . . . and we had about 14 dishes."
"This place is awesome. Went to Girl and the goat with my boyfriend for the first time,and I dont think it will be our last. We had six different dishes, including our dessert. Very simple but with great flavors. Our server Tony was very nice and he knew the menu, and he knew what we were going to like. This place is very chingon, and cant wait to go back and try the rest of the menu."
"I couldn't have been happier with this place - right now, it's absolutely my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Â We were a party of 4, which is the perfect-sized party for Girl & the Goat because we were able to share each and every dish with no problem. Â Every single thing we ordered was cooked to perfection, and best of all inventive! Â Our dinner -Oompa Loompa breadBeet and anchovy saladGrilled baby octopusEscargot and goat ballsSashimi with pork bellySoft-shelled crabGreen beans with fish saucePig faceChicken with mint and watermelon saladGoat cheese bavaroise Order it all! Â You won't be disappointed! Â The food was wonderful, the ambience was perfectly rustic, and the service was top-notch. Â I can't wait to go back!"
"I made reservations for my boyfriend's birthday a few months ago and after talking about how excited i was all over town (I am a major Stephanie Izzard fan) the mixed reviews came pouring in. Some people told me it was the best food they'd ever had, others cautioned on the strange flavor combinations and another said it was one of the worst dining experience they'd had. That scared me. I cancelled the reservations and we went to Epic instead.My birthday was six weeks later and he surprised me with reservations to the G & G. I was excited but again, a little intimidated. We were supposed to have reservations at 6:30, but they called the night before and moved our reservations to 5:45. I thought that was weird.As I walked in the wonderful fragrance of smoky coals was a great welcome. We were seated right up next to two groups on either side and it was uncomfortably close. Our servers had to do sideways wiggles to refill our wine or bring us our next plate.We ordered the G & G house wine--which was fantastic. Also I am a sucker for cute wine labels and was happy to see that cute little goat on the bottle. Highlights:- Green beans were the hit of the night--for sure the best green beans I've had, ever.- the house red wine, mellow and surprising- our waitress was helpful, kind and left us to savor our meal in our own time- tapas style ordering, the food came out item by item, which I love- short rip pasta (had a much more exotic title) was shockingly flavorfulLowlights:- Red fish with black bean puree didn't come with black bean puree. Sad.- the Ham frites were a mixed bag. The smoked tomato dipping sauce was out of this world but the fries were way too fatty and it seemed like they were covered in bacos (sorry Stephanie!). - I thought the food was really salty, which coming from me means a lot. I was glad they kept the water coming!- the incredible stomach ache i left with after consuming my weights worth of really rich foodAll in all a special experience. It sucks when places are so hyped up that your expectations are unfailry high. I do think I'll be back, if only for those green beans."
Everything is delicious. The service is wonderful. The drinks are amazing. YUM.
"Friday night, party of 3Food was interesting and crazy good. Â Server was awesome.I agree with other diners...once this place starts rolling, it gets very loud.Nice bathrooms!"
"I was ready to be underwhelmed.After all the buzz, I didn't think that it was possible for Girl & the Goat to live up to my expectations. I was wrong.I made reservations on opening weekend and couldn't get a table (for 2, mind you) for several weeks. After eating, the first thing I did was book another table for a few weeks from now. This place is worth making plans for.It was packed, it was loud, but it was also energetic and fun. The open kitchen in the back is well designed and the aroma of the wood burning stove really adds to the atmosphere.The food:- bread with onion butter that I would eat by the quart- grilled baby octopus with a lemon pistachio sauce that was the highlight of my evening-delicious roasted cauliflower with mint and pickled peppers (who knew those ingredients went well together?)- ham frites -- a little greasy, but interesting- delicious fudgecicle with olive oil gelato. It was a perfect portion and a perfect ending.Some reviews advice vegetarians to stay far away. I disagree -- went with my roommate (who doesn't eat critters) and the server immediately marked up the menu and pointed out some great, equally delicious options. Another highlight of the evening were the cocktails. The cherry in the old fashioned was killer, and the Sazerac was the perfect after dinner drink.I can't wait to be back. Forget the celebrity factor (though Stephanie gracefully handled some of the Top Chef fanatics who kept pulling her from the kitchen), this place is worth the buzz."
"I really wanted to love this place and thought that I would after reading previous reviews. It was a fine experience but nothing to yelp about! Here's what we ate and my thoughts on the dishes-1) Gjetost pancake - This was too greasy. It was stuffed with something but the greasiness of the pancake overwhelmed the stuffing.2) Pan fried shishito peppers - These were actually pretty good. They seemed lightly breaded and were just the right amount of spicy.3) Seared scallops - The scallops were on a bed of pumpkin puree with pomegranate seeds. The scallops were cooked well but were too fishy for my taste. The pumpkin puree was good.4) Pan fried duck tongues- This was delicious. I highly recommend ordering it. The duck tongues tasted like pork rinds!5) Goat chorizo flatbread- The flatbread wasn't crispy enough. 6) Skewered lamb heart - Meh. This dish could have been so creative and it was just drowned in spices that didn't complement the lamb heart.7) Pig face - This was our least favorite dish. The pig face tasted very fatty and there was nothing in the dish to cut through the fat.8) Goat Empanadas - The goat was fine but the empanadas were too greasy.9) Chocolate bouchon - Based on the ingredients I was expecting an amazing dessert. However, it just tasted like chocolate cake with chocolate ice cream.10) Pork fat doughnuts - Nothing special. The doughnuts fell flat - quite literally.11) Goat cheese bavarois - This was ok but could have been better if the goat cheese had been sweeter. I think this restaurant could be good if the chef figures out how to get these creative ingredients to work together instead of overpowering the dishes with spices. I will definitely give this place another try. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things.I have seen some reviews that compare this restaurant to Sprout. This place doesn't hold a candle to Sprout. The dishes at Sprout are light and fresh and all the ingredients are well thought-out and incredibly creative."
"This was a very enjoyable meal even though we had to wait quite a while for a space to open up so we could sit down and eat because we had no reservation. The waiting was tempered by some very good cocktails, including a barrel-aged Manhattan that I would drink way too much of if I lived in Chicago. We ended up quite well fed too, and I found the confit goat belly with crab and lobster and the goat loin to be delectable. A nice bottle of Ch. Musar was a perfect accompaniment to the food. The staff was great, and their enthusiasm was very engaging. Overall, it turned into a special dining experience that outstripped my expectations."
"Service- excellent- friendly, unpretentious, knowledgeable.Atmosphere- Upside: trendy, packed on a Monday night, cool decor. Downside: very strong smoked pork smell... wool peacoat still smells strongly of smoked meat after drycleaning :(Food- creative and tasty. Definitely not a low fat or low sodium meal. Not a good place for vegetarians and especially not vegans. Scallop dish was the favorite. Apple bread was very good. Green beans good but slathered in aoli. Sepia and chickpea fritters pretty good. I tend to favor lighter, healthier food, so this wasn't my favorite meal, but I can see the draw of the restaurant. They do what they do very well, and I value good service... They definitely are well run with excellent service. I think it's worth trying."
"I really, really do think this place is over-hyped. Â Everything I had tasted exactly like something my mother would have cooked for me when I was growing up. Â Don't get me wrong, my mom is a really good cook, but the concept of waiting two months to get into a place that uses interesting menu items to create dishes that basically taste like southern cooking made with uninteresting items... Well, that's my definition of over-hyped.People are more proud of the fact that they got in than they are that they ate the food here. Â I really do believe this. Â If you served the exact same food at an under-hyped hole-in-the-wall the reviews would be just as good as they are now. Â Yet, no one giving those reviews would say they'd be willing to make reservations two months out for the food. Â That's what you have to keep in mind. Â It's good food, but it's not worth the wait and the bother with that massive of a crowd."
"So amazing. Â Beyond my expectations. Â I love how they take simple dishes and make them in a whole new way. Â For example the ""Pig Face"". Â In my opinion totally a play on the classic American breakfast. Â Hash browns, egg, and pig face with a sweet tamarind glaze which made me think of a breakfast meat like sausage or bacon and syrup. Â I also love the pretzel bread, the dish with the bbq chicken, fried pickles, nann, and two sauces that looked Â ketchup and mustard but were more spicy Indian flavors. Â So fun. The service was very nice as well. Â  Also 4 people, a bottle of wine, and so much food we were were in pain for $200. Â Not bad in my opinion."
"I really like this place except for the wait. Â I tried to get reservations and it is always busy. Â However, found a trick and decided to get the non-reservation area (bar and couch area which are walk ins). Â Around 5:30 pm the two of us found a place at the bar and it was very cozy. Â It didn't feel too intrusive with the people who were waiting around us. Â We ordered mussels (amazing), pork ribs (gets even better) and oysters (would probably skip next time). Â The bartender gave us a free appetizer, he says that its one of the perks of sitting at the bar (not all the time though). Â They have good selection of beer and wine. There were definitely some misses such as one of the fish dish was bland and forgetful and Beef Tongue (would skip) but overall the ambiance is very nice, food is good and service was very friendly. Â Would definitely return."
"The beans, the mushroom ragou Â and the pig's face all rock. Amazing Flavors. Can't wait to go back. Reasonable prices for what you get."
The Girl got my Goat!WOW. Â What a disappointment. Â Steph your place or whomevers it is really is taking an old LetUsEY rest. projection. Â Went on 23rd April for BD which in itself is not a huge big deal but geez what has happened? Â You guys what be getting ready to go national because if you could have turned tables any quicker you would be a KFC. Â In fact I think people linger longer there. Â So where do we start. Â A 2008 French white should not come to the table warm. Â Weird smell. Â Server was CLUELESS. Â  For these prices they should know better. Â Also Fish after Chicken. Â Interesting. Â Food was good but between the service and honestly mediocre balance of the dishes and then the just horrible dessert make up for not slowing down the food to our table when asked (I am guessing if you ask the kitchen to slow down they look at you like your nuts). Anyways just really disappointed. Â I have seen this so many times because lets be honest if you own this place and book 3 months solid out why would you not churn and burn. Â I get corp dining but not for this quality. Â Its like they are just trying WAY to hard and way too much salt which is a sure sign of hiding something or whatever. Â Anyways Little goat amazingly good. Â Girl and Goat not so much. Â I am staying on the North side of Randolph. Â Maybe it helped that actually the first time I went there Steph actually made my amazing Breakfast. Â  Seriously Little Goat rocked.
"Request Lindsay. She's very knowledgable, has a great personality, and ups the fun factor incredibly! The menu gives you the option to be adventurous or live within your comfort level. Enjoy! My girlfriend and I have been here with friends twice now and the place does not disappoint. The more people you have the better the experience (up to 6 people) because every dish is served to share. More than 6 and you might need to order more than 1 of everything. Enjoy and request Lindsay. She is worth the tip!"
"Went a second time w/o reservations but before 5pm on a Friday night so we sat at the bar which is full service. Â Anyways, my date and I tried some different items this time around including the ginger butter & apple puree with bread, goat cheese flatbread, fritters, squash blossom rangoon, and scallops. Â We were disappointed in the rangoon, and the scallops were a bit rubbery. Â Service at the bar was pretty bad that night. Â My guess is that guests w/ reservations get higher priority. Â We had to wait about 40 mins between our second and third plates. Â I would give this experience 3 stars but averaging out with our last experience, I would give Girl & the Goat 4 stars overall. Â I hope they're not going downhill. . ."
"Goat empanadas were my favorite! Â Yea we waited a month to get in but it was so worth it. Â I know this place doesn't need another review but its still getting one! Â As for all the 1 star ratings claiming the food concepts were gross, you're idiots. Â You can't give a restaurant a shitty review because you don't like the menu selection. Â If you think pig face sounds gross and don't order it because of that then you can't review it. Â The food is not too salty as some people have claimed, these jokers are also the same types that review 7/11 hot dogs and give there local dive bar 5 stars because they have fun there or feel nostalgic about it. Â The nice thing about yelp is anyone can review, the bad thing about yelp is that anyone can review. Â These reviews are supposed to help people explore and find new places etc. Â Giving your local grocery store 1 star because they stopped carrying your favorite juice is not helping anyone.Ok I'm off my high horse."
"The Girl and the Goat smells like woodsmoke and bacon. So much so that when we left, my hair had a whisper of smoky pork scent to it. This is a very, very good thing. We ate too much, but it was practically impossible to stop ourselves from ordering a dish too many. Everything on the menu is so tempting! Standouts were the hiramasa crudo, which was outstanding. I could have eaten two plates full. Also, the green beans with fish sauce and cashews and the grilled lamb ribs with grilled avocado salad were stellar. YUM.Cocktails and wine were very good. There is a great list of beers and good options of wine by the glass. I did note many reasonable bottles on the bottle list as well.For dessert we split the fudgecicle with olive oil ice cream and fought over the last bites. Our server was cute and very attentive. She had lots of suggestions and helped us choose our plates wisely. At the end of the meal, we were handed a considerably smaller bill than we had expected, but there was a mix up and we received another table's check. No biggie! We were not surprised when she told us of the switch.My only complaint is that the dishrag napkins shed lint EVERYWHERE. I had on a black dress and my companion was wearing dark jeans, and we were covered in thick, white fuzz. Good thing there were no blacklights! All in all, a very solid experience. Can't wait to go back."
"Here's the skinny:Squish Squash bread: freshly baked bread with flavored butter and apple puree. Pretty good. Green beans: Crunchy green beans with savory fish sauce dressing. Very good. Good portion size. Hiramaso Crudo: Three thin slices of fish with bits of crisp bacon. Very small portion for $$ but delicious. Escargot Ravioli: Not bad. Escargot was clean tasting, but there are more appetizing fillings for ravioli.Pig face: Two small crisply grilled patty of pork face with fried egg. Absolutely spectacular!Goat belly confit: The goat was less gamey than I expected and it paired well with the crab and dressing. Cleaned the plate in two mouthfuls. Either my mouth is too big or the portion is too small??Masadas: Two mildly sweet donuts with pear slices and ice-cream. Of course it was scrumptious.Pear wontons: Again, fried dough with ice cream is always a winning combination. The pear filling tasted faintly of ?coriander? Whatever it was, it was genius.Even at 6 pm, the restaurant was packed with a steady stream of people waiting to grab a table. Overall the meal was solid and innovative without disappointments. Service was also equal to the quality of the food."
"Went here with a friend last night, so excited to check it all out! Â On the whole, it was a great experience, and given time, I am sure Ms. Izard will find her groove with her menu. Â But some thoughts.1) Â The wine list was excellent, and the server knew his stuff with regards to what to recommend. Â The bar was also very nice.2) Â The decor was pretty, but a bit standard for Chicago restaraunts these days. Â It was dark, with light wood ""rustic"" looking furniture. Â Very well done, but a bit common.3) Â Our waiter was fabulous. Â I know her co-owners are with the Landmark, and apparently some of their staff have wandered over to this place, and they were great: Â Polite, professional and extremely helpful.4) Â Parts of the food were great, parts were a bit meh. Â The greats were: Â  Â a) Â The liver butter for the fat bread. Â The bread itself for that matter. Â  b) Â The cauliflower Â  c) The scallops (oh my lord those were wonderful) Â  d) Â The beigneis Â (I know I'm spelling that wrong)The dishes that left something to be desired were: Â  a) Â The veal sausage. Â It came out a bit dry. Â  b) Â The golden plum dressing for the fatbread. Â Really Tart, almost like the fruit was out of season? Â  c) Â The softshell crab - but the corn salsa with it was wonderful.Also, I feel it was a touch on the pricy side for a ""shared plate/tapas"" style of cuisine.In short, I really did enjoy my experience there, but I would love to come back in six months when she's had a chance to sort of shake the cobwebs loose and make the necessary adjustments."
"Everyone seems to love this place. It's like the most hyped restaurant in Chicago. I just moved here from New York, and was eager to try it. I finally tried it out on a random Tuesday night during a snow storm. To my suprise, the restaurant was still packed! I really liked the ambiance. It has this whole wintery industrial vibe. The service from the hostess, valet, and bar was impecible. I couldn't believe how quickly a bartender came up to me to give me a drink and food menu, even though we weren't sitting at the bar. Unfortunately, I could not sa the same about our waitress. She had way to many tables, was not attentive, and was quite frankly rude. Not impressed.I just don't understand all the frenzy around this restaurant. I think it's OK. The price point is certainly impressive, but most of the portions are small too. Â We tried the broccoli, goat carpaccio, sugo, beef tongue, and fish tempura. Out of all of those dishes, I only liked the sugo and the fish and didn't think they were amazing. The beef was too oily, the goat carpaccio was nothing to brag about, and the broccoli had way to much cheese. I guess given the hype around this place, I expected more. I feel like everyone just keeps going to this place because it has so much hype around it. I am a little hesitant to insult those that rave about this place. I just think a lot of people go here that are not foodies, and are just quick to brag that they ate duck or beef tongue or something like that. I would have to believe there are much better restaurants in the city where you don't have to wait 2 months to get a reservation."
"Although I typically would wait until a place is open longer than a week to review; after all there's always a few kinks that need to be worked out. Â Combine that with all the buzz and high expectations that's been building about this place for the past year and there's a potential to be let down. Â But, I have to say my experience at Girl and the Goat on just the 3rd day of their opening was fantastic. Friendly hosts and servers; everyone was very knowledgeable of the dishes along with the nice beer/wine list. Some of my favorite dishes were the chilled onion soup, the octopus w/ guanciale, ham frites and crudo. One thing with the crudo; you can't eat the little lardon of pork belly with the crudo it's self. The flavor is so strong it wipes out the fish. But if you eat a piece of fish w/ the caper berries, then take a bite of pork belly, and back and forth the contrast between fatty belly and the acidity of the crudo is fantastic. The only dish that fell short for me was the wood grilled escargot. Everything was cooked perfectly; just not a lot of flavor. Overall though an wonderful meal. I know some people may complain about paying for bread but seriously, if you try the roasted garlic bread with the anchovy butter you'd wonder how they're not charging double for it. Â Seriously, it's that good!Luckily the wife and I live around the block so we'll definitely be fighting the masses and returning again and again!"
"The place is unassuming when you enter but the food blows you away.The cocktails and wine were pretty good. We showed up on a Saturday night around 8:15 pm. There was a two-hour wait for tables. The lounge area was first-come first-serve, so we positioned ourselves for the couch tables. We got a couch by 9 pm.The waitresses are very sweet and attentive. It is a little loud in there, but the music was good, so we didn't really mind. By the end of the night, we were hoarse from all the yelling.The menu looks good, but when you start ordering dishes, pace them out so you can taste everything. Their small plates are not too small, just perfect tasting-menu size for four people.Crispy Pig Face - If there is one dish you will eat here - eat the Crispy Pig Face, it looks like cutlets but just an amazing taste and textureRoasted Cauliflower - AM-azing. Whoever said you can only do so much with cauliflower was wrong.Chick pea Fritters - I hope this does not fall off the menu when they change it periodically. Definitely would get it again. Has some mozzarella in it as well. Very very good.Ravioli - Really really good, would definitely get againSkirt Steak - wonderful, must try. Very tender and tastySmoked Goat Pizza - Soggy with too much red cabbage. Not something I would order againHiramasa Crudo (Pork Belly) - Was good as far as pork belly goesPan Fried Shishitos - Really good, but you catch a really potent pepper here and there, so watch outSausage-stuffed Calamari - The texture was just off and the stuffing smelled raw, was probably the least favorite dishFor dessert, we finished up with the most amazing desserts -Friend potato dumplings - TO DIE FOR, not too sweet but just right and very very yummyFudgesicles with Olive Oil ice cream - Really really fudgy and yummyI can't wait to go back here!"
"The restaurant was fun but I agree it was totally hyped up. It was not the best food I had in Chicago. The bread is artisan and made fresh daily, Some dishes were hit and miss. We ordered the beet salad with white anchovies. We were told to toss it. Even so the dressing did not compliment the beets. The anchovies were delicious and fresh; but the dish did not come together with the avocado creme fraiche.The best thing we ordered was the roasted pork shank. It was perfection. The portion was large. If you just ordered that and a salad it would feed 2 people.It was noisy and the tables crowded."
A decent meal but nowhere near what the hype would lead you to believe.
"There is not enough space in this tiny review box to describe to you just how much we love this place. Â Every time we go, we make another reservation when we get home. Â All I have to say is: Â Go. Â Just go. Â It'll be your favorite, too."
"So overrated, sorry. Â Perfect example of a ""wannabe"" gastropub- Â a menu that tries too hard, mediocre food, and really snooty host staff (we watched from the bar as they turned some poorly dressed people down at 5pm with an empty room, and then shortly thereafter, sat the same number of people without a reservation who looked more chic). Â Coming from NYC, and being accustomed to REAL gastropubs (I hate that word, by the way), this does not make the cut, sorry. Â I gave one star because the atmosphere isn't all that bad. Â Come on Chicago, you can do better than this!"
"Just the name alone convinced me to dine at Girl and the Goat during my Chicago visit and so I did. We arrived for our 9 pm reservation and the place was absolutely crowded and the air smelled of good food. We were taken to our table and our server kindly explained the menu and told us that most of the dishes are to be shared and she also recommended some of her favorites on the menu. We ordered kabacha squash ravioli with mushroom, brussels leaves, and shroom crÃ¨me fraiche. If you can make me enjoy something brussel then you have a winner on your hand. The squash ravioli was light and creamy and the mushroom crÃ¨me fraiche was so delicious, but then again I love anything mushroom. Next was the bourbon poached lobster and crab with goat belly. The place is called Girl and the GOAT. I had to get something with goat in it. The poached lobster and crab was perfect. It was just freaking perfect. The sweetness of the lobster and crab plus the vanilla bourbon butter made this my favorite dish. There wasn't anything special about the boat belly. It just gave the dish another element of texture. We continued with another dish caught from the sea and that was sautÃ©ed skate with blood orange and spiced hazelnut. This was my least favorite. Not that it wasn't any good but it was just very plain. Just sautÃ©ed fish and that was that. Reminded me of a dish they would serve at a Chinese restaurant. Last on the menu was the wood oven roasted pig face, sunny side egg, and tamarind, cilantro and potato stix. The braised meat was tender but like any braised dish it becomes heavy with each additional bite. The egg was cooked perfectly and gave the dish another layer of needed texture. We ended the meal with a dessert served in a jar that was layered with bourbon apples, cranberry, miso marcona almonds, and maple gelato. This was probably my second fave dish of the evening. Each bite was warm, creamy, and sweet. I would recommend this dessert to everyone! I had a delicious meal and great service was the cherry on top. I'm glad I made the trip over the G&G. I loved the different layers of flavors that were used in each dish and would definitely recommend this to place to someone traveling to the windy city."
"With over 700 reviews as of this writing, what can one say about this glorious gastronomic experience?It's simple: Â the Girl and the Goat makes me glad that I am alive.After a 3 month wait, with my beloved and two of my best friends in tow, what did we order? No, the question is - what DIDN'T we order?12 separate taste extravaganzas (actually, 13 counting the extra dessert our fabulous waiter slipped in because we were such enthusiastic and grateful guests - it pays to be fun and nice):- chickpeas fritters, romesco, hazelnut hummus, sesame, goat feta = more, please!- roasted cauliflower w/pickled peppers, pine nuts, & mint- smoked goat empanadas w/ masala, ramp yogurt = exquisite- bread = ""Dock of the Bay "" served with lobster butter and remoulade.G&G always offers daily unique homemade breads and it is imperative that you get one - no, I mean it - DO IT. This one? Phenomenal.- oysters = ""Grilled Phantom Creek"" served with horseradish aioli.Admittedly, I am not an oyster fan but my friends loved them. (I don't ""get"" oysters. To me, they are like swallowing warm snot. WTF.) - pan roasted halibut brandade, grilled asparagus, green garlic, blackberry = perfect texture and great flavor combos.- grilled hanger steak, trumpets, ramps, miso-marcona almond, green almond nuoc charn = I am not going to pretend I know what the hell all this means. I just know it was melt-in-your-mouth good.- sliced sweet potatoes served piping hot in a small crock with bleu cheese.- we also ordered a pork dish but damn it, I cannot recall its details and it is not listed on the menu/website. Suffice it to say it was my favorite of the evening - the pork fell of the bone. Mwahh!And last, but not least, dessert. We ordered three - our waiter treated us to the fourth one:- rhubarb n' lemon, shortcake, buttermilk panna cotta, lemon gelato, salted graham cracker- sesame semifreddo, pork fat donuts, sambal pineapple- blood orange sorbet, parsnip pot de creme, pistachio cake, three sisters cornmeal crust- bittersweet chocolate, shiitake gelato, toffee creme fraicheAll were delicious, however, two comments: 1. though all 4 of us like mushrooms, we just did not like the shiitake gelato. No offense to G&G - just not our cup of tea; 2. even though I am a chocolate whore, my favorite dessert will forever be the blood orange sorbet. OMG. I will never NOT order it. The unique consistency combo of the cornmeal crust combined with the cake and pot de creme sends shivers down my spine - not to be missed.What an amazing meal."
"i just went here for the first time this past weekend and we had the most fortunate pleasure to consume plenty of the dishes and cocktails without any concern of the final bill.from what i remember:- pan fried shishito peppers (eh, munch-worthy)- sauteed green beans (excellent sauce)- roasted cauliflower (a bit too salty)- chickpeas fritters (holy hell! i could eat these all day.)- seared scallops (perfectly seared)- wood oven roasted pig face (the egg was fucking beauty and perfection)- ganache pork fat doughnuts (sounds off-putting but the blackberries tie everything together) - wood fired rappahannock (ugh, these were so weirdly good)- skewered lamb heart (strawberries added a nice contrast)- hiramasa crudo (who doesn't love crisp pork?)- seared tuna (the harmony seemed a bit off to me)as long as you understand that most of the food is rich in flavour (sometimes, too many components in one dish or ""aggressive seasoning"") and rather heavy in digestion, then there is no disillusion or disappointment about what you experience there.this is (obviously) one of the best restaurants chicago has to offer."
"Simply a perfect dinner. Â I was very impressed between our server we have now had two times in a row, to our 5 dishes that came out perfectly spaced out, and the wonderful atmosphere.. Definitely worth the 3 month advanced reservation"
"From the moment we walked through the doors we knew this was going to be a wonderful experience. Our waitstaff was helpful, attentive, and extremely friendly and unstuffy, and helped me (a vegetarian) navigate the menu. We started with the corny bread, a delicious sweet corn bread, topped with whipped goat cheese and fresh corn. It was divine. Our favorites of the night were the green beans in fish sause, kohlrabi salad with blueberries, and the potato dumplings for dessert. Even the things that sounded a tad strange were so harmonous it's amazing other chefs haven't come up with these flavor profiles before. I went two days ago and am already looking for an excuse to go again."
"Spectacular.I have been telling my husband that I've been wanting to try this place out for a while. We didn't have reservations and he checked everyday all week for an opening (hoping someone would cancel)...we scored an early dinner reservation for my birthday! Â Call ahead for reservations!!We currently live in the burbs and drove into the city for dinner. Â Valet parking only $10! Once we got there, the hostess led us to our seat, the best seat in the house... right in front of the cooks! It's was just plain awesome. We had a front row seat watching how each plate is prepared and we were able to ask the chefs what we should get! It was so much fun to get to watch each dish prepared. Â I had never tried a ""caperberry"" and asked the chef what it tasted like... he proceeded to just cut one for me and my husband to try. Â In addition, Â they gave us two free dishes, the chickpea dish and a dessert, both were delicious. We had ordered 5 dishes and received 2 free. 7 dishes total for just the two of us was PLENTY! Our highlights of the night were the chickpeas dish, goat belly, diver scallops, and pig face. Â My overall favorite was the goat belly! Super rich with the bourbon butter and lobster and crab--cannot go wrong! Â We also ordered the beat salad and sweet potato gratin-- both were also good. Â The dessert they gave us was good and had so many flavors! Â My husband and I also had 3 beers between us... our total bill was $100 plus tip... can't beat that!We would go back in a heartbeat--absolutely loved this place. Â Can't wait to go back and try 5 new dishes!! Â Ask for the table by the kitchen if you can! What an awesome experience!!"
"So, I wasn't thinking this place was going to be nearly as good as all the hype. It definitely was. Its really tough to get a reservation (we went on 4:45pm on a tuesday) but well worth it if you can get it. They will tell you to split 4 or 5 plates each, which, in my opinion is waaay too much food. I didn't come with a HUGE appetite but I was ready to eat. My friend and I split one of their amazing breads as an appetizer, we followed that by sharing the crispy pig face and the goat pizza as our entree. Both were so good and we were very full, but had enough room for dessert. Although the dessert was interesting, I think I would definitely skip it next time. All in all, I will definitely plan to go back here as soon as I can get another reservation!"
"The Food is AMAZING. We ordered ALL (yes, all!) of the vegetarian menu options for just the two of us. It was delicious. Olives, peppers, squash ravioli, etc.... were all to die for. I was not a fan of the bread - we ordered the apple something and it was good but not awesome. I was also not the biggest fan of the drinks, but they were nice concotions and were just something new... There were two things I did not like:Two of the vegetarian dishes were not vegetarian ..... one had anchovies (could easily be taken off so it was ok), but the other were the beans which were made with fish sauce and could not be changed. Bummer cause I was actually looking foreward to those beans....The second thing was the service... NOthing horrible happened, but our waitres seemed judgemental - when we ordered our third round she looked at me as if to say ""really - you're going to dink more?"", she didn't come around that often, and lastly and most importantly, she forgot my friend's cake with a candle - for her b-day. I thought forget it - so she forgot it's busy, but than she pissed me off with her whole demeanor - she was the passive-agressive type, so I told her she forgot and she needs to bring it out. She also had a unibrow, but we can't judge her for that ;) Food is Awesome. (although there was something I did not like - the desserts - save yourself some money and don't order any) Service sucks! At least ours did. Â Five stars for the food - which in this case was so great, it trumps the sucky service."
"If you like over the top noise you will love this place. Â Way too noisy for me! Â Also, they really shoehorn people into the restaurant. Â While not communal seating, it is as close as possible. Â Great server, friendly and informative and very professional. Â Overall, I think the food is over hyped and just a little too much going on (how many ingredients do you need in grilled baby octopus and where's the octopus?). Â I think the flavors become muddled and not really distinct. Â  The best is the pork ribs, but $17 for 5 ribs served on top flavorless slaw??? Â Maybe a good place for a couple of beers some bread and one or two of the more reasonable small plates."
"Sorry to say, I am lowering my review a star. Â Not because of the food, but because of the horrific behavior of the host on the last visit. Â Here we go...Third visit, reserved (obviously) months ahead of time with our preferred server. Â Confirmed by calling the restaurant five days ahead to again verify time and our favorite server. Â Confirmed yet again by G&G when they called me just before the reservation.Upon arrival, a full 60 minutes early for the reservation, I'm told the reservation is now at a different time - and that I'm wrong, it was never the time I claimed. Â It's been confirmed and reconfirmed, so that is clearly a lie. Â  They stand firm - AND are shitty about it. Â Oh, and you also can't have your server. Â Fine, we'll just extend the pre-dinner drink.We return at original reservation time, just to make sure, still no change, but still the same super crappy attitude. Â I appeal to the other host.. nothing. Wow.... really? Â Not even a sorry?When they finally go to seat us, we get a last little FU by getting dumped in that table for four in front of the door. Â (Seriously, why is that table even there? Â Just the worst location.) Â You don't like that one? Â Oh, well then wait a bit longer.At this point I've whipped out the phone to start a Yelp review on the spot because I'm pissed. Â I've waited tables, I've been a host. Â I'd NEVER act like this to a customer. Â We can't leave because of the wait and we're hosting the dinner for a special occasion. Â One of our party steps in and somehow gets the 2nd host to remedy things a bit. Â He's suddenly come around, apologizes, and is buying us a dish or two. Â A nice move, but WAY late in this process.Our new server is in the unenviable position to now make us happy. Â We rebound and she's great. Â Then she says we're not the first to complain about this particular host. Â Maybe that's a standard line to bond with us, or maybe it was actually true. Â I'd lean toward true since they was no reason she was picking on just us - am betting she was rude to others that night too.The food was good, but not quite as good as the first two times, likely some or most of that is because of getting so repeatedly dumped on during the greeting, and missing the server we planned on. Yea, I realize there are variables, and nothing can be perfectly timed, and some servers are not available. Apologize, smile, move on. Â Everything (until the final kick save) was wrong with what the front desk dished on us to set the tone of the evening.Memorable food; once again, the oysters are outstanding. Â Sadly, Â the best part of the evening's interaction with staff was via the valet. Â He brings the car back in the rain, as I'm headed over to him he's bounced out with a smile and makes a very complimentary comment about the choice of driving music. Â Smiles all the way home. (But you still lose a star.)"
"We went here for a birthday dinner. The place has a fantastic decor and vibe. However, the service leaves something to be desired -- hence the 3 star review. I'm vegetarian but my husband is not and we both were pleased with the meal. The best part of the meal was the bread. We got both the wheat and corn breads. They were absolutely delicious. The rest of the food was tasty albeit a bit on the heavy side."
"I don't get all the hype, made reservations months ago, went there on Saturday. Place smells great, staff was great. Food was just okay. Best things were the chickpea fritters and lamb loin, everything else was just okay. Pig Face was good, i don't think its worth all the hype. Left hungry, 4 of us, ordered 10 items."
"SO GOOD! We went here on Saturday and were wowed by the food and the service. Â We tried the cauliflower, chickpea fritters, hiramasa crudo, sockeye salmon tartare, seared tuna, kalbi style beef ribs, roasted pig face, corny bread, and goat empanada. The only thing we didn't absolutely love was the salmon tartare. Â You MUST order the empanada, hiramasa and seared tuna. Â For dessert we had chocolate cake with shiitake gelato, pork fat doughnuts and goat cheese bavarois. Our fav of the three was the doughnuts. But what really made our night was our server, Marnie. Â She was AMAZING- attentive, helpful and so friendly. If you can, request her because she is the best server we have ever had."
"It's rare to say that everything at the restaurant was good but everything at this restaurant was good.The dishes that we got included: cauliflower, chickpeas (three ways), soft-shelled crabs, and beef tongue. Â Dessert was the dumplings (donuts). Â All dishes were prepared well and there was nothing that was missing or needed to be added - each dish had a good balance.I personally am not a fan of beef tongue but the way it was prepared at the restaurant made me rethink it.Service: The service - from the server to the chefs - were all pleasant and attentive. Â No complaints."
"Went here in a group of four for a late night dinner (9:30 res, I think). The place was bumping on a midweek night. The floor is cool, with a somewhat open kitchen (making the place smell smokey, which I liked but be warned), nice long bar area and small lounge. Seems like a good way to try it might be to sneak in with 1 other and drink/eat at the bar. Oh well, we had four and a reservation, so we ate at a table. Staff was a little trendy/hipster for me, but ok it's a popular hip joint, so I'll forgive. We had 8 dishes between the four of us. My favorite was the tuna (some tartare/poke/raw marinated variant). The group was loving the bread and honey (with comb). Let's see, we had scallops, mussels, out-of-this-world hangar steak, goat something (I wasn't crazy about it, but the others were), oh-so-tasty beets. And I can't remember the last thing. Wine was good, cocktails fun. Overall a really good night out with friends. Not going to take the hard of hearing there, too noisy, but I dug it a lot. Oh, and BTW, Stefanie came to the table to check in. Sweet (for us and of her)."
"Actually 2 1/2 stars......4 star food, 4 star service, 0 star ambience.Had dinner with my wife on a Thursday evening, 6:30 reservation and the place was already packed and bustling. The host was plesant and we were seated right away...bad news was we were seated next to a charred wood wall. Interesting design concept that should have remained a concept. Â It smelled very strongly of Â smoke, like I was sitting around a campfire in the woods, it was that strong. If it wasn't the wall was it the wood burning oven in back? Is their hood or exhaust fan broken?The tables are so close together you have to move the table to get in and out, Â both of the groups next to us felt like they were at our table, very annoying....plus the place is so loud you have to scream to have a conversation.The food was good, we enjoyed everything but the mussel dish, Â quite bland and the hyped up sausage crutons were just an odd pairing that didn't work. Â Meat dishes are very rich and heavy, everything is loaded with thick sauces, lots of flavor in a over the top way. The veal & escargot soup was fantastic, hope that makes the regular menu.Basically a very good meal ruined by the uncomfortable dining room. Â When we got home we had to head straight to the washing machine and throw our clothes right in, they stunk of smoke."
"As a vegetarian, I was not quite sure how many things I'd be able to eat here... turns out, plenty. Â The food was unique and interesting, and the flavors were well-rounded. Â I also loved the texture of the chickpea fritters - highly recommended.Based on our server's performance and the food, I'd give 5 stars. Â However, minus one star for hovering hostesses who too obviously wanted us to leave. Â Yes, I understand you need the table - I get it - I was a hostess once, too. Â BUT - If we make a reservation 2.5 months in advance, order well, and tip well, then we will leave when WE are ready, thankyouverymuch."
"We went here the week of New Year's, and I was worried that there was no way that the restaurant could possibly live up to the hype. Â Wow, was I wrong.We walked in to G&G, and I was immediately struck by the noise level. Â I was really nervous that our evening was going to be spent screaming at one another, but as we moved farther back into the restaurant the noise level seemed to become much more manageable. Â This was a relief, for the atmosphere at G&G is really wonderful. Â The lighting is perfect - not too bright, not too dark. Â The kitchen is open, but there are two large tables between the kitchen and the rest of the restaurant. Â These tables provide a nice buffer between the kitchen and the other tables. Â All in all, this is a great space for a meal.And, what a meal. Â The remarkable thing about G&G is that the food is absolutely first rate, and it is still very, very affordable. Â While this isn't the best food I have ever eaten, I do think that this is the absolute best value I have ever experienced at a restaurant. Â We asked for advice from our waiter, and he gave us a number of excellent suggestions. Â Moreover, he steered us away from dishes that he thought were subpar. Â I really appreciate that sort of input. Â I am particularly impressed whenever the server at a restaurant has tasted and really knows the chef's dishes. Â All in all, the service was simply first rate.So, the food. Â We ordered two veggie dishes, two fish dishes, and a pasta dish. Â We also ordered bread and dessert. Â For our veggies we ordered the cauliflower and the green beans in fish sauce. Â I wasn't sure about either one. Â I loved them both. Â The cauliflower is absolutely amazing. Â It is prepared with pickled peppers and mint. Â Who would think to put these things together? Â Yet, once you've tasted the dish you'll wish you had thought of the combination. Â The crudo we ordered was delicious, although I left most of it to my girlfriend so that I could concentrate on my scallops. Â (She has a shellfish allergy, but when the server told us how great the scallops are she insisted that I get them.) Â The scallops were cooked perfectly. Â We also tried the goat, veal, and pork sugo. Â Heavenly. Â The meats were cooked in a way that made them melt in your mouth, and the pasta was perfect. Â I don't usually find myself overly impressed by pasta dishes, but wow - this is a must have.For dessert we tried the bourbon apples. Â Once again, the ingredients that were combined in this dessert balanced one another perfectly. Â The apples and gelato had their sweetness cut by the tart berries, and the overall effect was remarkable.With a bottle of wine, this meal cost $120. Â $120. Â I told the waiter that I would have paid substantially more for the food we had just eaten, and, to his credit, he responded by saying, ""We know we could charge more, but we don't think that really good food should be unaffordable."" Â Cheers to that. Â The Girl in the Goat deserves every bit of the press it is receiving, and it is sure to be a ""must visit"" for me when I return to Chicago in the future."
"Went their to meet friends with high expectations. Â Now the expectations has met its match. Â Wonderful, perfect and fantastic all at once! Â A great people place, great wine and perfect food combinations."
"When we dined at this spectacular establishment, it had been 2 weeks since they formally opened. Â So -- the place was crazy busy and the wait was 2 hours. Â As a workaround, our friends had scoped out the lounge area where you could have drinks and order.Our only objective was to try the food so if we had to grab some chairs and sit outside or hangout by the kitchen, we were going to do whatever it took to eat. Â Our friends had waited for 45 mins before we were able to position ourselves strategically near an opening to the lounge seating.I tell you all the things we had to do and the length of time we had to wait or willing to wait because the food is that great. Â Yes --- its great enough to wait 2 hours (well for us it was 45 mins), but we were willing to sit outside (even though there are no chairs).First off --- we were in the lounge area so I have no idea what it's like to sit in the main dining area, but I don't think decor makes or breaks so I hope that I still stay consistent with my reviews. Â At the end of the day its the food, service and the desire/need/want to come back.Service was actual great. Â Server was spot on with recommendations and you're always lucky when you have people who have personalities Â (believe me there are times when you have people who aren't people persons...but this was NOT the case with Girl and the Goat). Â Everyone there was warm, friendly, helpful and willing to give you their opinion on the food.As for the food, the small plates are not tapas because a lot of the dishes (we ordered 7) were very complex in ingredients and taste. Â I didn't know what to expect, had no idea why this place was so hot and didn't know who the chef was and why she was popular. Â But I do know that the food was really good.Softshell Crab was by far the best dish we had. Â Second was the green beans (I'm not a big veggie fan, but they did a great job of covering up the bean taste with more of the acidic flavors). Â Overall, the flavors were more on that acidic range which is perfectly fine by me. Â By no means do all the dishes have the acidic flavor, but the ones that really stuck out in my mind were the softshell crab (the shell was so smooth, crunchy and flavorful) and the beans.As busy as this place is right now, I would definitely wait the 2 hours to try the rest of the menu plus to enjoy some of the favorites (well the ones I liked). Â Hopefully when its NOT too busy, we can bring our other friends and family to try out the food.Oh yeah -- one last thing...I didn't watch Top Chef and again, no idea who the chef is. Â So without having that prior knowledge, I still think the food is great!"
"absolutely wondrous. Â seriously.super vegetarian options, the most amazing service, a beautiful space, sublime cocktails....and the list goes on and on. Â to top the night off, we dined across from CARLA of top chef fame. Â could not even deal!!the standout of the night was the kabocha squash ravioli with mushroom raisin ragout, brussels leaves & shroom creme fraiche. Â one of the best things i have EVER tasted. Â and i love the bathrooms on the lower level. Â very important to note :)"
"What can I add that hasn't been said already?Not much - this place is awesome!The beet salad comes with actual anchovies - no jarred fish paste, here - so be warned if you aren't a fan of the salty fish.The marinated pea pods, were a terrific surprise - dig in with your fingers and enjoy the flavour of the crisp, fresh peas and the tangy balsamic glaze (don't worry about getting messy, they bring moist, warm towels to clean off with).The pig face...wow. Â As a fan of pig parts, in general, I was still surprised at how good this dish was. Â My only complaint was that the portion was too small...and the serving dish was removed before I could lick if clean of the sweet sauce.For dessert, I got the blood orange sorbet over a parsnip pot de creme and pistacio cake with cornmeal.Holy moly - just when I thought nothing could top the pig face...I was introduced to parsnip pot de creme. Â Sweet and creamy, migling with the tart sorbet and the crunch of the cornmeal.It was the perfect dessert to finish of a fantastic meal."
"i'll keep this short and sweet. Â one of my top 5 meals over. Â got all the stuff that everyone else talked about, so just read their reviews.the only words out of our mouths were scrumptious, delicious and mmmmm. Â yummy sounds abound.worth the wait for the reservation, went ahead and made another one the very next morning. Â can't wait to go back."
"Went to Girl and the Goat on Friday with pretty large expectations and for the most part GG lived up to them. It seemed a little odd to have to pay for bread but I would rather pay for great bread than be handed stale bread. The liver butter with the fat bread was excellent. We started with the beets, grilled octopus and goat pizza. Â All were very good. The beets were slightly understated because of the accompanying salad. Octopus was great. Â The goat pizza was definitely my favorite dish of the night. We then had the crispy skate, steak a la plancha and scallops. The skate was cooked to perfection but the sauce was pretty ABC, my second favorite dish. The scallops with veal were great third favorite dish. We then got the rabbit rillette and grilled lamb. The lamb was a bit fatty for my taste but the rabbit was very good. We then got another goat pizza (it was that good) and the crispy pigs face. The pigs face was the most disappointing dish of the night for me. Very bland and an odd texture. For dessert we got the fudgecicle, goat cheese bavaroise and frozen corn nougat. The bavaroise was excellent and all of the desserts did a good job playing on the sweet and savory combination. All in all our group had a lot of fun and our server Amy went above and beyond and was a great help. It's a bit pricey $260 for our party of four with four cocktails and a bottle of wine, we ordered a lot of food for four people, I was very full when we left."
"This is our second time at Girl & the Goat and it made up for every negative experience we had during our first visit. If you haven't made a reservation, make one as soon as you can. Â The food is amazing and the overall experience is unmatched. Â With every dish you feel like you're one of the Top Chef judges!Here's a highlight of some of the things we ordered:1) Razor clams: This was by far my favorite dish, sour and tangy with a hint of smokiness. 5/52) Green beans Â - Not your ordinary green beens! The fish sauce vinaigrette gives them a unique sweet and sour flavor. 4/53) Seared tuna - the blueberries and lemon were a nice twist. 4/54) Seared scallops - the cantaloupe seemed a little odd for this pairing. 3/55) Smoked Goat empanadas - Meat was very juicy, not gamey and had a Moroccan flavor. 4/56) Squash blossom rangoon - Sweet & savory, light & crisp. 5/57) Skate wing - light and crispy but a little greasy. 3/58) Duck Tongue - nothing special, probably wouldn't order this again...2/59) Bread (can't remember the name) with Cherry Pepper Aioli - very greasy and dense...would not order this again. The breads are usually good but order one for the table otherwise you'll fill up too quickly. 1/510) Shiitake gelato - Delicious....would have never thought mushrooms and gelato could be so good! 5/5"
Still amazingly delicious.
"So I know this has been built up to be aaaamazing, but I thought I'd try it out to see for myself. I loved the hickory smokey smell upon walking in, but granted I needed a shower bad after eating there because it permeated my hair and clothes big time. Â Had a reservation and they seated us very quickly, although we asked for a table one over from ours so we weren't sitting next to a big table...the hostess said she would have to check and we'd have to follow her back to the stand...umm alright...but they gave us the table we wanted easily.The food was all technically prepared well and looked pretty but flavors were not quite right. Â We got the mushroom foccacia bread which was pretty tasty (would order again), the chickpea fritters which were decent, suppia(which tasted like a firepit wayyy too smokey flavor, would have been great if a little lighter.), goatbelly with lobster which again would have been great if the vanilla flavor wasn't too strong. Â It verged on being a little too sweet and the sauce paired better with the seafood than the goat. Â Also ordered the pork ribs which were cooked very nicely and were pretty tasty...and a pasta(can't remember the name) that had goat and rosemary and gooseberries. Â The gooseberries literally made my face contort from how sour they were. Â Would not order again. Â Dessert was decent, something chocolate with a foie fluff(didn't get any foie flavor, just marshmallow) and more gooseberries, this time the berries tasted a lot better.Our waitress was wonderful, answered all the questions my inquisitive boyfriend had.I'd go back but I'd probably order an entire different menu."
"The food was good but I think there is more hype than necessary. Â Treated boyfriend for his birthday. Â He had wanted to eat here for a long time. Â  Â Portions were quite small and pricey. Â Limited menu. Â This is close to home, but we don't have plans to return."
"After two months of making a reservation, my husband and I went to G & G this evening. Â We ordered green beans, pappardelle, and pig face which were very rich and tasty. Â However, the restaurant was so NOISY that I could not hear my husband who was less than two feet away. Â This really spoiled my evening; I could not wait to leave."
"Service was weak and SERIOUSLY, Charging for the bread, come on!"
"Great place to share food and enjoy drinks. Â You'll need a reservation months in advance and the menu constantly changes so go with whatever your waiter recommends. Â I had the goat pizza, chick pea fritters and the oysters, all of them are awesome!"
"There is a reason this place has a 2 month wait for reservations. Great food and service. However if you don't want to wait 60 days I recommend walking in early (say 6) on a weekday (not Thursday) and ask to wait for a table...you will probably be seated within 30 min...as long as they are not filming ""Americas Next Top Chef"" which they were doing during one of my recent visits. As you wait, enjoy the cool bar area at which you can also eat if you so desire. If you have a large party do yourself a favor and do not sit at the Â table parallel to the kitchen unless you like excessive noise and a variety of smells too pungent for the average nose."
"I got food poisoning on 12/30 from this restaurant. I called the restaurant to tell them. They said they would have a manager call me back. They didn't. Not only did I waste money at this restaurant, it also cost me my New Year's Eve plans. I will not go back. These things happen - I would not have been so mad and in fact waited to post any type of review too, hoping they would handle this better. To date, I have still not heard from the restaurant or been issued any type of apology."
"The bread. THE BREAD! It was soooo good. Funny how the least expensive items on the menu are the best. The other items I tried, a smattering of random stuff, ranged from delicious to average. The dessert, for example, was less than thrilling. But I would go back just to order every carby bread option and skip the meats. Oh yes I would."
"The food here is wonderful. The cocktails are superb and the dishes were outstanding. My favorite dishes were the chickpea fritters, green beans in fish sauce and the berry dessert with goat cheese. The only drawback is trying to make a reservation!"
"BEST MEAL of this trip. Â We had the beet salad, chick pea fritters (whivh were so delicious we ate them extra slow) escargot raviolis (amazing and with an Asian flare to the sauce,) Â braised pork, which was Really done right-love the smokey flavors. Â I kind of wish we tried the pig face as well, maybe we'll just go back! Â It really looks as if everyone knows about this place But if you're a tourist in Chicago as I am and unsure where to go- It's the best restaurant I've been to in a long time possibly ever because of the unique layering of flavors we experienced. Â This is a popular place but not a typical popular tourist trap. Â My daughter and I sat at a communal table along with two other parties of three and one extra cute baby in with one of the parties from SAN DIEGO, it was all of our first times and we plan on trying her other diner style looking place right across the street while we're here as well."
My bf took me here just monday for our anniversary and the food was amazing! Its a great place to share. I order the pork belly but I was not a fan. The pig face was delicious! There was a salad dish with pears and cheese that was okay. The pork shank was yummy according to my bf but I thought it was okay. Definitely coming again!
"Again, I'm not a foodie but I know good food when I eat it. I didn't have TV until I moved here to Chicago about a year ago. I had no idea who Stephanie Izard was (and probably still couldn't pick her out of a lineup). I just knew that my gf mentioned this place and it just sounded good. I was surprised when I called that I couldn't get a weekend reservation for months. I'm glad I did. I took my gf and her parents there. We over-ordered, but it was still worth it to be able to try everything. Honestly, nothing specific stands out (hence 4 stars instead of 5) but I do remember thinking it was awesome. Good place to take a group of hungry meat-eaters."
"Went with a group of 8 so we ordered pretty much everything on the menu it seemed. My beef with large groups and small plates is that you only get a small bit of something you may have really wanted to eat. I really liked the decor and could tell someone put a lot of attention to detail in the design. The service was excellent and very attentive, but not obtrusive. Here is a quick and dirty review, since we had too many dishes to remember:Liked the squash blossom rangoon, but this is not something too unique to the restaurant. Unfortunately, a majority of our dishes were very heavily salted. Particularly the ribs. Very salty! Green beans were too salty, roasted cauliflower was too salty. This is ironic, because the other day I told my friend I will lick my finger and eat a little bit of Maldon sea salt at home because I feel like I crave it. Well, now I can just go to GatG instead! The scallops were popular, but again, kinda salty. The big shrimp were probably the least favorite with the heavy sauce and seasoning. I had some drink, Best of Three, I think it was called that was very good. I always like something with Pimm's in it though. In summary, not sure the 3 month prior reservation is deserved. Or does all the hype set you up for a let down?"
"It's hard to live up the the hype when your restaurant doesn't have an open reservation for 2 months, and even then it's at 5pm on a Tuesday. However, Girl & the Goat delivered.First piece of advice: don't let the lack of reservations scare you off. There is a large bar and lounge area that is first come first serve. When we got there on Sunday night around 6:30, we were told the wait would be an hour to an hour in a half, but within 15 minutes or so two seats at the bar had opened up and we were on our way to foodie bliss! We started with the spence wheat bread with peanut butter butter and honeycomb. The bread came out piping hot and the PB butter was sweet and salty and smooth and delicious. We enjoyed this but of course, the goal here isn't to fill up on the bread! Next came the delicious chickpea fritters. Earlier reviewers mention them coming with goat cheese, but they've since changed the dish and it comes with fresh mozzarella (fine by me as I'm not the biggest goat cheese fan). The inside of the fritters was so creamy and yummy and the fried chickpeas that come with them gave it a nice little crunch.Then got the squash blossom ragoon. They were okay, could have used a little something more (maybe more crab)? Not my favorite, and less innovative than most of the other dishes we tried. Still, they were good and we ate them all!The goat empanadas were the favorite for us. The goat is so tender and moist and meaty. I'd never had goat and I was very pleasantly surprised. Plus, how can you come to a restaurant with the word ""goat"" in the title and not try it? We loved them and savored every bite. Then of course we had to try the pig face. We cut it all into little pieces and mixed everything together as suggested by our server, and it worked beautifully! Very very good, loved the crunch from the potato stix.The only truly disappointing thing we ordered was the ham frites. They just taste like french fries with bacon bits (and not even good bacon bits - taste straight from a jar) coated over them, and they are incredibly salty. We enjoyed the dipping sauces that came with, but left about 3/4 of the large basket uneaten. I would skip this, would much rather have tried one of the veggie dishes. For dessert we had the chocolate cake with shiitake gelato and toffee creme fraiche. For a chocolate lover like me, the cake was pure heaven, and there was a ton of it! The mushroom gelato sounded a little strange but the flavor was subtle and worked with the chocolate. The bits of toffee added the perfect crunch (I found myself digging around for the toffee pieces!). Awesome end to a fabulous meal.Girl & the Goat is definitely a winner!"
best restaurant i've been to in my life! pork champ is crazy good. the tuna was UNBELIEVABLE. it's kind of expensive but it's SO worth it!!!!!! fully recommend it
"Where do I start? Â This was one of the best meals and service I have had in the Chicago area. Â I was not drinking the night we went but the people I went with did have a few cocktails and they were pleased. Â I tried my friends drink - some Grey Goose, Pimms and cucumber concoction and it was very tasty! Â  We started off our meal with 2 breads and spreads. Â The spreads were amazing, one of the spreads was a mushroom butter - so delicious. Â Our first 2 dishes came out - hen of the woods mushroom ragout, the flavor of the ragout with the sweet potato ravioli was incredible. Â The second dish was the hiramasa crudo, i was not sure what to expect with this but it was so good. Â It was served cold and the fish was so fresh it melted in your mouth, the pork belly was a good added touch! Â The next 2 dishes came the sweet and sour cheek cod and the green beans. Â Both so full of flavor. Â I highly recommend you get the green beans as one of your vegetable choices! Â Finally the pork ribs which were falling off the bone and the goat belly with lobster (which was one of the specials). Â I absolutely loved the goat belly. Â It is very rich and you can really only eat a small amount but the flavor is just amazing. Â Dessert was our last course. Â  Â We had an apple dessert with dumplings filled with cheddar cheese - don't let the cheese fool you - it was a very interesting taste! Â The most amazing thing about this restaurant was how everything you ate was a new flavor for your taste buds. Â The order in which the plates came out was perfect and it all seemed to compliment one another. Â We did not have a reservation but got there right at 4:30PM when they opened and they were able to seat us with the caveat that they needed the table we were at by 6:30PM. Â We figured 2 hours was plenty of time, which it was but we were in our seats for all of that 2 hours. Â Our server was incredible. Â He was knowledgeable and gave us recommendations every time we ordered. Â Everyone was so attentive - my water glass was never empty. Â Stephanie Izard has a hit on her hands! Â I can not wait to go back!!!!"
"Pig Face incredible! Service was flawless. Â From start to finish the Girl and the Goat continues to impress. Â  If you have not gone yet and love food, this place is a must."
"If you're truly, deeply, madly in love with salt, you'll enjoy Girl & the Goat. Â I was hoping for some other flavors though."
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago!! A MUST GO. Make your reservations early! If you live in Chicago or you're a visiting and you have a passion for food, Girl and the Goat will not let you down. The food is absolutely phenomenal and the prices are very reasonable for the quality of food and service you will receive."
"Excellent food, with escargot ravioli coming out as the favorite of Â what we ordered. The chicken and kohlrabi salad were good choices, as well. Of course my partner had to get the pig face, as does every table. I'm told it was as good as described by others. Â Only things I was Â not that impressed with were the sponge cake dessert concoction and the wontons. Seats at bar and surrounding area were all taken 20 min. after the doors were opened. Hint---there is a nice quiet bar 2 doors down with an impressive collection of wine (thank God). The noise and overly crowded atmospere of G&G can be overwhelming. You just need to squeeze into your limited space and try to not let it take away from the experience of the out of the ordinary, excellent dishes. One of those places that displays the real art of knowing how to combine unusual ingredients into dishes you've never had and will never have again. I appreciate that when it happens. Â For the price you pay though, they should give a little more elbow room and not book so tightly. Sitting someone on a seam of a booth is unacceptable for the price I'm paying. Â Also, the jeans and t-shirts the servers wear Â give a Burger Kind feel and don't match up with the food or prices."
really lived up to the hype...service was excellent and food was top-notch...did not disappoint...
"Are there more stars hidden somewhere? if there are add them on because this was not only among the best food I've ever had, but was by far, the BEST dining experience of my life, to date. Made a reservation two months out (bc frankly, that was the first available) and it was well worth the wait. We were seated at the chef's table overlooking the raw prep area and I couldn't have asked for better seating! We were treated like well-respected members of the staff and given some secrets of the kitchen along the way. This was a gastro experience unlike any other, from tastes to smell to texture, everything was spot on! I could bore you with the gory, erotic details of my dining experience because this was more like a seductive dance than a meal, but I've never tasted the flavors experienced at that table that night. Because it was on the menu, and an irregularity at that, we had to try the pig face; I had no idea what to expect but it turned out to be the moistest, most delicate piece of pork I've ever tasted and so well-seasoned I almost cried tears of joy that for ONCE someone has finally done right by pork and let the meats natural flavoring show through! Our waiter was above exceptional, recommending cocktails and pairings I might never had considered (a Manhattan with the belly and smoked oysters) and selected a fantastic (house) red for the pig face and chick pea fritters (holy yum!) and was patient with our selections, never rushing us to make decisions just for the sake of table turn-over.Don't skip dessert, the pastry chef knew what he was doing when he turned over not only the strawberry and graham cracker flavors, but also blueberries and goat cheese, to me, it was heaven in a final course. Now its time for me to clear my schedule and get that next reservations on the books because this is somewhere I've been raving about to everyone who will listen, and the fortunate bystanders near enough to hear my tale of love and food devotion."
"Best restaurant I've been to in Chicago so far. Â Food was phenomenal, presentation beautiful, server very helpful and friendly. Â I would give this restaurant a higher score if I could- an absolute must."
"I went here in July of 2011 and felt that the place was over-hyped and left me feeling underwhelmed. Â Alas, I gave it another go. Â I was able to score a reservation for 3 people the day before via OpenTable. Â It seemed like a sign.Our server was Lindsey and she was phenomenal. Â Having not loved my food choices during my first visit, we asked her to create a menu for us and she delivered. Â Every item we tasted was delicious. Â I don't think I have ever eaten so many green beans in one sitting!I suggest, to anyone, give your server a bit of insight to your tastes and let them create your menu. Â I will definitely go back here again and again."
"I have been to Girl and the Goat a few times and I do like it a lot. Â Is it the best restaurant ive even eaten at no... but fun, different than many, and good food yes :)Here is a breakdown of some of the items we had...-- Pig Face: really good...maybe could do without the crunchy potato things but otherwise tasty-- Chickpea fritters-- good but not omg-- Pasta w/Mushroom Ragout: the pasta itself was great (i think filled with squash maybe?) but the sauce was cloyingly sweet and just didnt seem to make sense to me--- Bread w/chedder beer sauce. Â Bread good but cheddar sauce was not a sauce more like a spread and it was cold? Â Not sure if that was on purpose--Octopus: good a bit salty but i like salt lolGoat loin: not my fav...too smokey in flavor for me-- Scallops: prob one of my faves--- Chocolate Thai Chili dessert: a little ""off"" to me.. def. preferred past desserts here like the one that was similar to a smore with the foie gras fluff. Â That was deliciousI think we actually ate more but im forgetting what everything was called now...Service was great as always...the servers are very nice and know their stuff"
"I visited Girl and the Goat right when it opened and have only gotten around to reviewing it now. But, if you're reading this, you already know it's great, probably destined for a Michelin star at some point, impossibly popular, intensely interesting. So what do you need me telling you more about it - just go!"
"This place should be called, ""Girl and the Sheep,"" because the hordes flock to this establishment like they were being forced to by a shepard. By the way, the shepard is usually named Penny Pollack or Jeff Ruby. Two stooges who, more often than not, recommend hype (creating more of it) rather than great food. Girl and the Goat is one example of this, as is The Bristol, Epic, etc... Nine times out of 10, Chicago Mag's ""Hot List"" is made up of restaurants that cost millions of dollars to open. So it begs the question, does money equal a top-rating on the hotness chart? You are damn right it does! These restaurants have PR people rubbing elbows with, and perhaps giving handjobs to, the fine folks at Chicago Mag, Timeout and the rest of them, allowing their restaurants to be judged as spectacular before really running a full seating. But enough about the hype. The atmosphere, if not a bit too smokey, is very pleasant. The service was professional and it was nice to see the Izzard herself manning the window. The food though was nothing spectacular. It was, as some readers have noted, a lot of ingredients thrown together which in the end didn't create clean tastes. Yes, the kitchen was a little heavy-handed with the salt too. The salad with anchovies should have been named Anchovy Salad because that is all that stayed on your palate. The cauliflower was a testament to the mishmash approach to a lot of the dishes. The stuffed calamari was texturally whack. But, the one thing that sent my blood pressure a bit too high was the ""veal rack."" Or was it the ""rack of veal?"" Either way there was no rack involved - it was literally one tiny veal chop. The cost: $39!!! What a joke. The waitress, although very professional as I said, did push this on us quite aggressively - another sign of her professionalism depending on which side of the table you are on, I guess. In the end, the money spent did not equal the product sold. I think I would go back as a twosome and give it another shot. I think I'll wait until the hype dies down."
"This place is not for picky eaters or those unwilling to try new and sometimes strange (but delicious, I promise) flavor combinations, or those who refuse to wait longer than a month for an open reservation. Our group of 4 decided to order a bunch of dishes to share, and one friend had an inkling for the pig face. To be honest I was a little wary - I imagined an actual pig face with snout and all, but the actual thing was crispy and delicious, and the fried egg on top really sealed the deal. We also tried the roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers and pine nuts, the sweet potato gratin with crispy onions and blue cheese, the seared scallops (which I did not taste since I don't eat seafood), squash ravioli, ham frites, and several of their freshly baked breads... and we devoured it all... finished off with the bittersweet chocolate cake with shitake gelato and another seasonal cobbler dessert. Wow! Every selection was better than the last, and all were perfectly portioned and prepared. I would definitely recommend ordering many dishes to share versus single meals. They served up some good craft beer, too. Great ambiance and trendy decor. My only compliant was the inconsistent service. We had to wait a very long time for one of our dishes to come out (but they did end up taking it off the bill, and giving us an additional dish we didn't order on the house - which in my opinion more than made up for the delay). Is Girl and the Goat worth all the hype? Yes, I think it is, but for some the novelty is bound to wear off after one or two visits."
"OK, I admit it. Â I don't watch Top Chef. Â There, I said it - in all my foodie wannabe glory, I have never seen that show, so I had no real idea who Stephanie Izzard was and hadn't really known what the deal was with this restaurant. Â I did know they served goat, which seemed like a no-brainer, but that's all.Then, my amazing friend Jenny had a birthday and, in anticipation of said birthday, made a reservation at G&G months in advance. Â Several months, a tax return, and a glimpse at the menu later (small plates? OK!), my fiancee and I joined a rather large group there, surrounded by artistically burnt wood, beautiful dark furniture, and warm glowing lights. Â We were actually sitting at one of the nice long tables that allow you to peek into the kitchen.Then we ordered. Â First came the veggie-a-thon. Â We got a couple of the breads (the better one had a peanut butter/honey spread, the others were unremarkable), roasted cauliflower, beets, squash ravioli, sweet potato gratin, and a double order of the chickpeas. Â The chickpeas were a highlight, crunchy and with good, salty feta alongside them. Â I can see why we double ordered that one! Â Even better was the sweet potato gratin - those crispy onions were what did it, I think.For fish, we just got the sausage stuffed calamari and the seafood fideos - both were amazing! Â (Seriously, calamari serving as a sausage casing? Go to the head of the freaking class, whoever thought of that one, that is BRILLIANT!) We also passed around an amazingly tender lamb shank and a few plates of oysters, the best of which had a just-spicy-enough horseradish zing to it.We rounded it out with the bittersweet chocolate dessert, to which I will advise anyone afraid of shitake gelato not to be in the slightest - it goes great with everything else and doesn't taste overwhelmingly mushroom-y. Â Oh yeah, and probably a boatload of wine (really good shiraz, mostly).I was beyond stuffed when we left and heartily impressed. Â I loved the food, I loved the format, and I loved the style. Â I'd love to go back. Â And on one final note in honor fo the birthday girl who brought this amazing place to my awareness, they handle gluten free dining beautifully. Â If you're in the celiac club, this place will treat you right and you'll leave just as stuffed and pleased as anyone else!"
"We were lucky enough to know someone and get seated at the chef's table. Â I have never seen the show, but the friend I was with was starstruck whenever Stephanie spoke to us. Â We didn't order a thing; it was chosen for us. Â The menu changes often, but here is what we had:Bread course: spence wheat with ""hunk o'burnin love"" butter (peanut butter, banana and bacon) with a side of honeycomb butter.Appetizer: Â Chickpea fritters w/ heirloom tomatoes and fresh mozzarella. Â We wanted these to never end!Seafood course: Â Steamed Mussels w/ I don't know what. Â Magic? Â These were the best, most tender and delicious mussels I've ever eaten.Pasta course: kabocha squash ravioli w/ mushroom raisin ragu, brussels leaves, and mushroom creme fraiche.Beef course: Â skirt steak a la planca, chiogga beets, house pickles, wilted romaine, and salted goat milk caramel. Â Side dish: Â Ham frites covered in bacon fat and topped with dehydrated pork belly. Â Served with tomato aioli and smoked swiss.Fish course: Â pan roasted barramundi w/ black beans, buttermilk squash, and chicken of the woods mushrooms.Dessert course: Â cocoa nib donuts with pine nut brittle, ganache, roasted pear and oatmeal crumble.This might be my death row meal. Â This and Twizzlers. Â If she made something with Twizzlers, I think I'd combust."
"Had to wait 20 min even though we had a reservation. Â Food was great but the waitress recommended us ordering way too much. Recommend the backfat if they have it, liver mousellini, and pig face."
"5 Stars!!!Food:Stephanie Izard combines creativity with delicious. We had six different entrees between my wife and I and five of the dishes were spectacular. I specifically recommend the apple soup, the goat pizza, and the octopus. The only dish that missed was the beet dish. The beet dish was more a sardine dish that happened to have some beets swimming with the sardines. The Service:Simply excellent. From watching behind the back hand-offs between servers, to constant water refills, to a server who made us relaxed feel special - this might be the best service I've had since Charlie Trotters. The Atmosphere:It's loud. It's busy. But we still managed to have a private meal. The decor is extremely intentional and fun to look at. Other Things of Special Note:The bathrooms are worth a look. Everyone gets their own private bathroom with sink and toilet. Just make sure you look at the W or the M on the door as the private bathrooms are intermixed :)Stephanie Izard was expediting (standing between the kitchen and restaurant) and looking at every dish before it went out. I love seeing her hard work and attention to accountability. Five Big Stars!"
Everything was amazing from the moment we got there till the moment we left. would highly recommend eating here.
"Some restaurants are what I call ""Paris Hilton Famous"". They're big money-makers, everybody wants to go, but once you actually experience it, you leave with a burning sensation...that it was nothing special and had no discernible talent. The hype surrounding Girl and the Goat had me nervous. Immediately after opening it's impossible to get a reservation? I assumed it had everything to do with Stephanie Izard winning Top Chef, and less to do with the food. Wrong. The food is fantastic! Even though it's impossible to get a reservation, the staff is not pretentious. They are dressed casually, and feel approachable. We had a reservation for 8:45 PM on a Wednesday (all we could get a month out!) and I just resigned myself to having to wait. I've never showed up with a late reservation and been seated on time. The diners before stay later than anticipated, or they take just one too many walk ins. We showed up a few minutes early and were seated immediately. Within moments we had water and menus, and picked our wine. Our waiter Patrick offered some insight into the menu, but it was pretty descriptive so we had an idea of what we wanted already. It's definitely a great date restaurant since all the dishes are meant for sharing. Patrick suggested 2 to 3 plates per person, so we erred on the side of delicious and got 6.First of all, revolutionary idea America that only the Girl seems to have thought of; put bread on the menu! No more endless baskets of bread on tables. If you want some bread, order it with your choice of amazing topping and you'll be delighted. It was only $4 I think, so not a huge expense, but you make sure you really want it. We really wanted it. It's date night! (What wedding diet?) So we started with some warm crusty bread with two spreads that I can't recall to save my life, but they were good. Now for our meal...! We started off with seared scallops with pumpkin brandade, pecans, fried brussels sprouts, tarragon, and pomegranate. The scallops actually came out before the bread which didn't bother us at all, but Patrick was horrified and rushed our bread out, and took it off the bill. The oysters came out second and were my favorite. They were on the special menu for the day and they were fantastic. They had 3 options for oysters, and I know we got raw, but I can't recall exactly what was on them, but I loved it. They were my all stars for the night. We moved on to a lamb sausage stuffed calamari which was just perfect. The calamari was like a big soft piece of pasta wrapped perfectly around yummy sausage. We had ordered the goat pizza, but Patrick cautioned us against it. He said the pizza has 8 slices and is good, but you'll want about one slice, so to save it for a larger party. Good tip, and thank god because I shudder to think I almost didn't get the goat, pork and veal sugo over pappardelle with rosemary and cape goose berries. Perfection. We finished with short ribs off the special menu. You could basically scrape the meat off the bone with a spoon it was so moist, but there was a nice crisp coating on the outside. I found each dish perfectly portioned for 2. It'd be fine for larger groups, but you get 2 scallops, 2 calamari, etc, so you'd be dividing it in smaller portions with more people, no biggie.The dessert menu leaves something to be desired, but they have the right idea. Why waste time on it when everyone will be so satisfied with dinner they won't even want to think about dessert. I can't wait to go back to try the cauliflower, chickpeas, and pig face with sunny side up egg. Oh, and everything else on the menu. If you're starving, I think 6 plates is perfect for a party of 2! We licked them clean, but I didn't feel like I needed to roll myself out. Everything was perfectly seasoned. Lately I've been noticing a trend in over-salting in restaurants so severe I thought maybe my taste buds had changed and I no longer love the stuff. Everything here was fantastic, and no one flavor overpowered any dish. The timing was great. One dish at a time, and as soon as we finished one, another came out. I would actually not have minded some time in between, but we didn't feel rushed, it just seemed efficient.I had visions of seeing Stephanie in the kitchen, finishing dishes and giving approval before they left the kitchen, but she was not there last night. She was standing at the front when we left bidding diners good bye. Good enough!"
Came in with high expectations and Girl and the Goat didn't disappoint--we liked every bite that we took! Â Highly recommend it!
"A-mazing experience. Â Came from Seattle to visit a good friend in Chicago and suggested this place since she mentioned, Stephanie Izard from Top Chef is the chef/owner of the joint. Â We got seated immediately with no reservations since we got there right when they opened. Â Lucky for us as I heard you will have to make reservations way in advance to get seated or sit at the bar. Â What a hip and happening atmosphere. Â I loved the colorful painting, the rustic wood beam surrounding the restaurant and the service was impeccable. Our waiter explained every single thing that we were unsure of the menu. He even took out his own pen and crossed off some things as suggestions for our group. Â  Â All the entrees AND dessert that we had were delicious... pig face and all. Â But most of all, I favored the chickpea fritters. Yum. Â Can't wait to go back on our next visit to Chicago."
"Luckily got a last minute reservation here on a recent trip to Chicago, as someone just called to cancel before I rang. On first impression, walking in...the place is very dimly lit, with lots of dark, heavy wood and has a really cool vibe with good music playing (although that, I guess, that is subjective) and the place was packed. We were escorted to a table, that could only be described as small. You sit so close to the table next to you, that when I dropped my napkin, which is inevitable (due to the narrow table) I almost head-butted the patron next to me, when I attempted to pick it up. This might not of been the worst thing as they were arguing rather loudly and it might of helped the situation. Anyway,I digress...the food was divine. We both had the braised pork shank...and the meat literally fell off the bone. Had an impressive beer selection as well. Would of given 5 stars due to the very cool atmosphere and great food, but it was just a little too cramped for my liking...almost felt like sitting in a plane seat. I guess would be solved by booking a table for more than two."
"Prompt, enthusiastic service. Crowded, but not too much for the staff to handle. Plates were replaced as needed. Â Creative selections imaginatively titled. There were 4 of us; Â ordering 2-3 items we consumed a good portion of the menu and we liked everything. Save room for dessert. Â Pricey wines. Â Music had bass cranked up way too high. If you're not dining alone, be prepared to scream."
"I know this is the new ""it"" restaurant but I wasnt too impressed. It was OK but I really didnt love anything on the menu. Ill try again, maybe it was a bad night, but I am not rushing back here anytime soon."
"First: Â The Staff / Service.I have to say that the staff and service are TERRIBLE. Â I saw Stephanie Izard standing in the kitchen and checking on each dish that came out. Â She seemed very meticulous and it looked like she cares about her restaurant. Â However, I think that running and owning a good restaurant means that you have to pay as much attention to the front of the house as you do the kitchen and food. Â In this case, the host and hostess were running the front without much supervision and it appears, without much training.We arrived at the Girl and the Goat at 5:30 pm. Â The restaurant was half way full. Â Although I counted 7 empty tables, the hosts informed us that there was a 1 1/2 hour wait. Â We waited at the bar, watching carefully for an open seat. Â Many of the other people waiting in line ahead of us left or decided to eat their dinner at the bar. Â When we finally left 2 hours later, many of the tables were still open.Next: Â The Food.I was underwhelmed. Â I was hoping to find distinctive, flavorful, unique food. Â Surprisingly, I didn't find any of that. The food was good, but not great. Â With all the media hype that has accompanied the opening of the Girl and the Goat, I expected much, much more.The bread was very good.The seared scallops came with three scallops, one of which was very salty. Â The other two scallops were good, but they weren't anything that you can't get anywhere else. Â What was interesting though was the pumpkin brandade that accompanied the scallops. I always look forward to eating beef short ribs at restaurants because they are too much of a pain to attempt making at home and I've never been disappointed at a restaurant. Â That is until now. Â The short ribs were thinly sliced and lacked meat. Â The flavor was underwhelming. Â It was good, but it wasn't anything special. Â There are a lot of amazing reviews for this restaurant and, although I was underwhelmed by the food and put off by the service, I want to give it another chance. Â Stay tuned!"
This was easily one of the best meals of my life. From the first plate to the last I was blown away by the perfection of deliciousness that entered my mouth. Wow. I also really loved the ambiance. The goat empanadas stood out to me but everything we tried was exceptional. It was just a great experience and I can't wait to go back.
"Many of my friends had raved about how great this restaurant was, so of course, I had to try it. Â And they were right - the food is absolutely delicious.My personal favorites were the hiramasa crudo (yellowtail-like fish with pan-fried caperberries and fried pork belly), the pan-fried duck tongues (with shitake mushrooms and picked watermelon rind), the goat carpaccio, the goat belly, and the crepes.Though this is a small-plate restaurant, the ham frites and the wood oven chicken are much portions than the rest of the menu. Â The ham frites are a basket of fries covered in ham seasoning, basically, so they are much richer than you'd expect. Â After about 10 fries, you were basically done. Â And the chicken is about a quarter of a chicken, but with the naan bread, the fried pickles, and the sauces that they give you, it ends up being a lot more than you'd expect.So why didn't I give it five stars? Â The service. Â We had a great server. Â My boyfriend keeps a Kosher diet and our server even took a pen and marked all of the things he could and couldn't eat, which was very sweet; however, if his timing of our dishes would hav been as thoughtful as his gesture toward our dietary restrictions, the experience would have been much more enjoyable. Â We dined with another couple and we told him we were sharing with our significant other - basically, that we were having two separate meals. Â He seemed to understand and told us that he wanted our entire order at once so he could time the meal well and could pair things well with other things (so I guess at first, I didn't like that we had to give him our entire order. Â I'm a fan of ordering a little at a time). Â Did that happen? Â No. Â Our drinks came out WAY late (and did I mention that the Orchard Dram was delicious?!?), and he brought out all of mine and my boyfriend's dishes first, then the other couple's dishes last, so we couldn't really dine together at all. Â For explaining that timing was of such great importance, we didn't get that at all. Â I don't mind paying money for good food, but I guess I expected top-notch service as well for such a well-reviewed restaurant.The good things though - we were seated early, the host staff was extremely friendly, great ambiance, not too loud, and a great aroma (there's an open kitchen and it smells a little like a fireplace).Others probably had a fabulous time, and so if I could give it 4.5 stars I would. Â Because I was a server I may also tend to be picky about these things. Â But if you want really fantastic food, definitely go to the Girl and the Goat. Â You won't be disappointed!"
"I give this place 96 out of 100.Minus 4 points for being out of Lamb Shank when we went. Â Really, that's all I can think of that was negative.Positive points for amazing cocktails. Â The Aviation is one of the best gin drinks I've ever had. Â The cosmos got rave reviews from the women...because that's who drinks cosmos.Positive points for a great server that was really helpful.Positive points for a VERY imaginative menu that melded seemingly contrarian ingredients into a symphony of flavor. Â Yep, I just wrote that.Positive points for good prices. Â Seriously, I expected to drop $600 for a party of 6. Â We were out at $250 (minus bar drinks). Â Impressive.Positive points for a really well thought out interior design with an open kitchen, great bar location, good lighting, nice table spacing. Â It was crowded without seeming like a mob scene where no one knew what to do with themselves.Positive points for the Chickpea Friiters, Pig Face, Cod Cheeks, Scallops, Beans, Cauliflower, Roasted Beets, Tandoori Chicken, . Â All of it was unique, but delicious.Positive points for the orange sorbet desert. Â It was probably one of the best things I've ever eaten, and I'm more of a chocolate desert type of person.Other: Â Just an outstanding place. Â All around. Â Be prepared to wait, or get reservations months in advance. Â Both are worth it."
"I have been here a couple times and sadly my experience is always the same - great ambiance, cool space, and ok food. Â I remember going to Scylla which was AMAZING and am just disappointed that the food does not live up to that. Â Mainly, everything is either too salty or over-sauced. Â This is not to say however, that there are not some stellar standouts (namely, the chickpea fritters, the grilled pork ribs with tomatillo-mushroom slaw which practically fell off the bone, and some of the desserts), I just wish everything were as good as the standouts.As for the specifics of food: Â 1. Â Roasted beets, green beans, white anchovy, avocado crÃ¨me fraiche - bland except for the one redeeming avocado crÃ¨me fraiche. Â 2. Â Chickpea fritters with romesco, hazelnut hummus, sesame, and goat feta - great texture and taste. Â 3. Â Seared scallops with brown butter XO, goat sausage, white shrimp, shiitakes, winter squash - too salty and the scallops were overdone. Â 4. Â Grilled pork ribs with tomatillo-mushroom slaw, grilled scallion vinaigrette - the pork had a great texture and taste but the slaw was overdressed and lost its crispness. Â 5. The bread we got was actually really good with a great pomegranate slaw. Â 6. Â Raw Shibumi oysters with radish mignonette and tarragon - not bad but too acidic for the oysters. Â 7. Bittersweet chocolate with shiitake gelato and toffee crÃ¨me fraiche - the cake would have benefitted from being warm (which really took away from the experience) but the toffee crÃ¨me fraiche was great. Â Apparently crÃ¨me fraiche is the way to go here!Finally I wanted to make one comment about our waitress. Â Every time I've been to Girl & the Goat I have had great service (not overbearing but great insight and there when you want them), except for this past time. Â Our waitress was aloof (literally had to hunt her down after 15 minutes of not seeing her), had un-opinionated comments about the food (""everything is great""), took away food without asking, etc. Â As a restaurant of this caliber, they should definitely make sure the wait staff is well-trained."
"I've already been here a few times and each small plate is perfection! Â Chef Steph knows what she's doing...the menu changes, but current must-try dishes: the chickpea fritters and green beans seem to be a constant on the menu, the brussel sprouts were the best ever! Â I tried a lobster and crab dish that rivaled what you'd find at the best seafood places in town. Â The oysters with egg salad are my fav and have been on the menu my last two trips, they are a def must try if you like oysters! Â Also, the bread selection changes, I think daily, but it's alway good. Â The miso bread is my favorite so far...I was disappointed the GATG bourbon hadn't arrived yet, I so wanted to try it!"
"Absolutely amazing food, reasonably priced, great vibe. Â A great experience --- completely lives up to the hype. Â My daughter and I, visiting from L.A., could not secure a reservation, so we showed up at 7 p.m. on a Saturday and somehow found seats at the bar. Â The food is the same, and the service is super-friendly. Â The goat carpaccio is absolutely incredible -- if it is on the special menu, grab it! Â  Also unforgettable was the goat liver mousse, served with a blackberry compote, pickles, and just-baked, melt-in-your-mouth crumpets. Â  So fabulous! Â  The beet salad and salmon were also lovely. Â They have a terrific vegan menu. Â Everything is so fresh, interesting, and flavorful, and under $20. Â  Can't wait to return to Chicago so we can eat there again!"
"My wife and I received a gift certificate for G&tG for Christmas and time was a-passing so we started to look for reservations. Well, their reservation system is a joke, as you probably have found out. They perpetuate the mythology that the place is perpetually booked solid; so be it, that's their schtick. They are paying for open table but apparently do not really use it; maybe they do not need to at this point. So following the advice of many a Yelper we just showed up about 6 pm on a Tuesday. We sat in the cushion area, ordered a drink, and were seated in about 15 minutes. G&tG follows the horrible practice of making you settle the bar tab before proceeding to the dining area which is ridiculously difficult when you're trying to juggle a drink, your wallet, a credit card, the bill, and a pen, all with no surface to set anything down on. Whatever. We were shown to a table with a peremptory warning that it would be needed for someone else in about an hour and a half. Unbelievably rude, I know, but forgiven as part of the overall schtick again. Actually the hostesses were very nice college-age girls and I'm sure were just performing from the script. Atmosphere wise the restaurant is very loud and busy, not really comfortable; the clientele are the un-beautiful people, looking like every manner of suburbanite and tourist, mostly very casually dressed like today's air travelers. My wife had the 13 Cup drink, sweet but very delicious; I had a few glasses of the Malbec, very good but $11. To eat we had: the Mr. Potato Bread which came with two sauces, a leek butter, and a potato aioli which was phenomenal; the goat cheese tortellini, good as a non-meat option; the stir fried octopus which was a tasty mess; the pig face with matchstick potatoes, wonderful; the goat belly with the vanilla sauce which was very successful; and a quatro leches dessert which was kind of like a cookies and cream. The main descriptors here are salt and grease (delicious grease but grease nonetheless); Stephanie's cooking can be summed up as a ""beautiful mess,"" and it usually works pretty well. There are no vegetables or salads to speak of and everything is smothered in oil and butter and garnished with proteins; the octopus had ham in it and the goat belly had lobster and crab on it. Which is great for me but be forewarned. And for info, 7:30 came and went and there were several empty tables around us. So there you have it. I would love to visit again to try some different things but will probably wait until the crowd thins."
We on Saturday night. Â Need a reservation! Â Food was great - service was equally as good - and the setting was a fresh new idea. Â They definitely put detail into even the smallest thing.We tried a wide variety of food. Everything was great - already taking about going again!
"Girl and the Goat is a must if you enjoy different tastes and combinations. Â This is chef Stephanie Izard's signature style here. Â I think everyone seems to know who she is after her win on Top Chef. Â If you want to learn more about her cooking philosophy, she released her first cookbook just before Christmas and she talks about how she builds flavor combinations. Â Anyone planning to go to the restaurant should flick through this at a bookstore and they will get a good idea about what to expect.I loved this restaurant but as the menu changes frequently much of what I ate is no longer on the menu. Â I can recommend the green beans which seem to be a permanent menu item.The restaurant is big, attractive and noisy, very noisy. Â What is it with restaurant row on Randolph? Â Why do they design restaurants so they are ideal destinations for dinner with someone you don't want to talk to? Â Much of the time even the wait staff have to repeat themselves. Â If you can, get seated at a west wall booth because that does seem to deaden the din to some extent."
"Food is what I do. I am a champion eater and a master of food tourism. So the first thing I did when I booked my flight to Chicago was make a reservation at Girl and the Goat. As an avid fan of Top Chef I was super-excited to eat at the restaurant run by its first female winner. The only reservation I could get - something like 3 months in advance - was for 10:15. It was absolutely worth it. I'd wait until 2 in the morning and come in hungry to enjoy Chef Izard's phenomenal fare. (Also, she was there! Expediting food! Whoo celebrity sightings!)The atmosphere is very warm and friendly. I was impressed at how comfortable the restaurant felt, even though it was packed and very busy through our entire meal. The restaurant is very well-designed and we never felt crowded. Our server was absolutely phenomenal. He was very attentive and had great suggestions. When I explained that I was a solo meat-eater dining with vegetarians he was sympathetic and helped me pare down my choices to a manageable level.I do think it is a more challenging restaurant for vegetarians than omnivores. Although a third of the menu is 'vegetables,' some of the dishes contained meat or fish. My dining companions were happy with their food, though. We shared a delicious bread that came with a phenomenal cheese and beer dipping sauce. Our only complaint was that it did not come with nearly enough of the cheese sauce, but that was very quickly remedied! I also tasted the chickpea fritters, which were good but I thought not great. My friends tried a dish of peppers that came in a big ceramic dish and an asparagus dish. Both found the asparagus underwhelming, but loved loved loved the peppers. I am pretty sure they were wiping the sauce from the dish with their fingers. I say 'pretty sure' because my attention was elsewhere. I had business to attend to. Meaty business. I knew I had to try the pig face. I mean, PIG FACE. How could I pass up the opportunity? Both my waiter and server advised me to cut everything and mix it together before eating. Such good advice. The flavors were phenomenal. Although I knew I was facing a mountain of food ahead of me, I ate every bite. Absolutely incredible. I'd return for that alone. I also ordered the confit goat belly. I remember it being good, but alas the details of the dish are overshadowed in my memory by the incredible dishes that came before and after. After finishing the goat belly, I felt I still had something left in me - or rather, some room to fit something else in! So I asked my server what dish I should absolutely not leave without trying. He recommended the pork ribs, and he was right. They came in a delicious marinade and were served over an INCREDIBLE slaw. I don't even like cole slaw and my mind was blown. Although we had almost reached the limits of our gustatory abilities, we decided to have dessert anyway - and I'm so glad we did! The vegetarians ordered the bittersweet chocolate because it was served with shiitake gelato. We were intrigued, then we were astonished. SO BRILLIANT! I ordered the strawberry-rhubarb shortcake, which equalled the shiitake gelato in deliciousness. After the first bite, I proclaimed ""if my grandmother were a dessert, this is what she would taste like!"" That is a good thing. It was warm and rich and bright and homey; I felt like my tastebuds were hanging out on the porch in the summer sunshine. The hype this restaurant is getting is well-deserved. Chef Izard has created a restaurant that excels in all areas - the physical space, service, and food could all go toe-to-toe with the best restaurants in the country. It is hard to get a reservation, but worth persistence and planning ahead."
"We ordered way too much food for two but it was worth it. They recommend 2-3 per person, we got 9 plus dessert for 2 people.Good beer selection - could have used detailed descriptions of each, but I guess you can always ask if you have questionsFat Bread - great bread, maybe could have more liver taste in the butter. Apricot jam was tastyShishitos - my first time with them, they were really goodCrispy Pig Face - tastes as good as it soundsGoat Pizza - lots of goat meat, great wood fired crustGrilled Baby Octopus - niceGoat Meatballs & Escargot - the smallest plate of the night, snails were super tenderScallops w/ Braised Veal - probably my favorite dish of the night. Scallops hard seared on one side, veal ""stew"" was greatRoasted Cauliflower - came a little crunchier than expected but still good. Had some hot peppers which were pretty spicyRabbit Rillette - my least favorite dish, but at this point I was way too fullBlueberry & Goat Cheese Bavaroise - somehow found room to eat more"
"I wanted to love this restaurant (and am still thinking that perhaps they were just off that night) and am disappointed to write any review shy of great. The restaurant itself is beautiful with a cozy yet hip atmosphere but the food is what matters most to me. The spence bread, roasted cauliflower, and chickpea fritters were solid. I was incredibly disappointed by the scallops, roasted pig face, and goat chorizo flat bread. I'm still thinking that the scallops must have accidentally been dropped in a pile of salt. Although the waitress was very friendly, I was surprised by her disgust in the choice of wine my party choose. I was a waitress for ten years and know a better way to go about it. Again- I really wanted to love it, I waited two months for a good reservation and I can't say it was worth it."
"If only it didn't take weeks to get a reservation here, as I'm always dining at the bar. I love this place and come back all the time for the amazing meal and drinks. It's a great date spot or a wonderful place to take people from out of town."
"I'm always shocked when a restaurant lives up to the hype (and waiting 2 months to get a reservation) girl and the goat was absolutely great. Fun atmosphere, kind staff and the food was really worth talking about. We tasted almost 15 items on the menu. Each was more interesting and complex than the other. My only complaint was the goat ribs. Way too fatty, but maybe that's how the were supposed to comes."
"Been here three times, and still not sick of it! Â The food is so unique and flavorful, and even though certain ingredients in each dish scare me a little, I've loved pretty much every dish I've had here! Â Favorites include the special bread of the day, the sauteed green beans, the shishito peppers, chickpea fritters, and the scallops. Â Service is always reliable. Â Best time to go is 5pm without a reservation- have never had an issue getting a table at that time. It's early, but it beats the alternative of having to wait for months to get in. Â Plus, it usually fills up pretty quickly!"
"AMAZING... Pig Face, duck tongue, beets, roasted cauliflower, skate wing, oh and Absinth too.... Share everything. Service excellent!! Just make your reservation and GO!!!"
"I know I'm just adding to the tons of reviews but I was really impressed with this place. We did have to wait a month or two for a weeknight reservation but it was worth the wait. Despite it being the hot new place to go, it is not pretentious at all and has a great atmosphere. Our server was also very knowledgeable, down to earth and friendly. The food was amazing- very creative, unusual combinations that totally worked. The green beans stood out as one of my favorite dishes. I don't eat meat other than seafood and found that there were plenty of delicious vegetarian/seafood dishes. It is very smokey from the ovens though so expect your hair to have a smokey smell when you leave :)"
Very good. The lamb hearts were the winner. The pig face was our least favorite. We don't understand the hype. It tasted like an overly salty breakfast dish. Hiramasu crudo was tasty.
"I don't watch Top Chef, but I was wondering what all the hype was about with this restaurant and why it's so difficult to get a reservation! So, I finally got a reservation late on a Friday night. And, I guess it was a mistake in Opentable that I got this--but they said they'd seat me anyway since it was their mistake. Yeah! We only waited about 10 mins for the table, and waited at the bar. I saw that they're doing the classic cocktail thing, which is fine by me, I had an old-fashioned and though on the sweet side, it was very good. We all had different glasses of wine and the selection on the wine list was very good. It was nice to see some choices for Spanish wines by-the-glass.On to the food, omg, the food. We had nothing mediocre, it was all spectacular, from the crispy pig face to the chorizo ricotta flatbread, all interesting, but without being too interesting that the flavours don't mix. The goat belly with lobster and crab had to be the standout favourite. It was delicate and rich, and beautiful! We ended the savoury courses with the lamb heart which was perfectly prepared. Desserts: the pork fat doughnut is a must! We ordered 2 for the 4 of us, but there was only one left and trust me, our spoons were fencing. I don't even really like doughnuts, but this dessert was delicious! We also had the lemon rhubarb dessert, which was nice to have something lighter to end with, however, it did not lack for being a bit lighter. The atmosphere was bustling, thank god this is a large space or else it would be even harder to get in!!! It's also really good to know that it IS worth all of the hype and I will definitely return, hopefully sooner rather than later."
"my verdict? Â the food is commensurate with the price but ... not really the wait. Â i made a reservation for the girl and the goat THREE MONTHS before i was able to get table at a decent time (7 PM). Â don't get me wrong -- the food was tasty and the atmosphere was spot on. Â i think i was looking for a bit more of the ""magic"" that people who describe this restaurant allude to. Â i left with a full belly but with my brain fully in tact, not really blown in any way. Â perhaps my expectations were a bit off-balance... highlights? Â very reasonable wine list and hopping bar area. Â knowledgeable service, and very bold flavors/textures. Â soft, pillowy chickpea fritters that tasted cheesy and satiny. Â the crispy pork face, which was essentially a smaller version of breakfast: Â sunny side up egg, ""bacon"", and potatoes. Â you mash it all around, and mix in the tamarind sauce which gives it an unexpected sweet flavor. Â very tasty.the salmon tartare was also yummy, but i learned that i'm not a huge fan of raw shaved truffles. Â give me the concentrated oil any time, but i'll pass on chomping on these raw fungi. Â unless you're with a big group, i'd also pass on the ham frites, because they are ENORMOUS and you (like us) wont have room for any dish that comes after it. Â be careful, because the waiters tapas-inflate a bit. Â my dining partner and i ordered about 2 dishes too many, and at the end, we had to force ourselves to have dessert -- this should never be the case!speaking of dessert, try the ganache pork fat doughnuts. Â they were fluffy and dense and had a nice ""meaty"" taste that sounds really disgusting, but was really tasty. looking through this review, i'm confused as to why i left the girl and the goat wanting just a bit more. Â maybe it was the timing -- we experienced a big lull between the 4th and 5th dishes. Â maybe it was because i went expecting disney world and instead found myself in universal studios. Â who knows? Â i'll be back to figure it out -- if i can get a table again within the next half year."
"I was lucky enough to walk in on a Sat night at 7pm and score a table within 10 minutes at the bar, which is full service. Â Otherwise, I would have to wait for ages either for a reservation or for a table. Â The service was excellent here. Â The waitresses are extremely friendly and will help you pick out a beer or something on the menu. Â The food was very delicious but as a warning, everything is covered in sauce and the food is heavy. Â If you're looking for a light meal or mild, natural flavors, this is not the place. Â With that being said, I still enjoyed my meal a lot. Â There were 3 of us in total and we had 5 plates. Â We were full! Â We even had to cancel the 6th one. Â The chef was very nice to allow us to cancel it. Â The waiters recommend 2-3 plates per person, I think that's excessive.Had the green beans, which are excellent as other reviewers pointed out. Â Also had the shishito peppers (which I thought were ok but my friends really enjoyed it), goat pork & veal sugo, scallops and linguine and clams, which had an excellent sauce that I wanted to soak up with extra bread! Â For desert, I had the bittersweet chocolate with shitake gelato. Â You can really taste the shitake in the gelato. Â It sounds gross but the combination of the salty and sweet and bitter was excellent! Â  Â Overall, great meal. Â Came out to about $50/head for ~2 drinks/person and 5 plates. Â I would go there again except it requires some planning because of the wait / difficulty in getting a reservation."
"pretty effin amazingwe went early without a reservation and they were nice to accomodate us and even asked us if 2 hours would be enough as they had a reservation at 7. the plates are smaller but delicious. we had the bread, the duck tongue, scallops, and a few more dishes. the scallops were amazing but the star of the night was the goat cheese ice cream! to die for! i am craving some now and only wished san francisco had some goat cheese ice cream!!!"
"First we went here it was just a few weeks after they opened. Â I was unsure if they would have all their kinks worked out, but the night went smoothly. Â The food was amazing! Â Really liked their menu set-up and the fact that they were small plates and great for sharing. Â The prices were much lower than what I was expecting (a happy surprise!) Â Went back a second time with an out of town guest and was yet very pleased. Â The service was on top of their game and so was the food. Â Can't wait for a third visit!"
"After all of the hype from the show dies down and all of the ham dust settles, Chicago will be left with something that it never knew that it wanted, but now couldn't possibly do without - a girl that can take a butchered pig's face and turn it in to something beautiful."
Plate-licking good:- Roasted cauliflower- Beef tongue- Pork belly with hamachiMeh- Short ribs with edamame...I can make something similar at home. Not a fan:- Shishito peppers...too spicy and something I could make at home- Cramped space. The waiter's ass was awkwardly inches away from my face while she served the other table
"I popped in (without a reservation) with a friend on Tuesday night for a 90 minute wait. We stood at the bar, anticipating we'd be up for the wait. Â Super fast and friendly bar service was promising; alas we were hungry and my feet hurt. We left with the vow of returning with a reservation!"
"I loved this place! Excellent and inviting atmosphere. Open, industrial, Eco friendly, and hip. Indulging food options for the vegetarian and meat lovers alike. I had the chickpeas and the cauliflower. Both were filling and yummy goodness. I also indulged on some fresh sourdough with beer cheese. It paired perfect with the Two Brother's Cane and Abel rye and the Three Floyds' Irish red. I had to be pulled away from this place!"
"The dinner was delicious. We had the pork face, mushroom ragu, scallops, safu?, and the chickpea fritters. Â All terrific. Â The drinks were good too. Â The only downside were the deserts. Â Honestly I thought the mushroom icecream with chocolate cake was horrid, as was the peanutbutter custard was too tart. Â The table next to us tried a toffee desert which they did not like. Â I know it may be interesting to experiment with unique and unexpected flavors for sweets - but realy they did not work for me at all. Â Stick to the wonderful savory options."
"The Good: The food is unique and tasty; the drinks are great.The Bad: We like to take our time when we go out for a nice dinner. Literally right after we signed the check a manager came pacing back and forth around our table. We felt so uncomfortable that he succeeded in getting us out immediately. This was definitely the most rushed and uncomfortable we have felt at any of the countless nice restaurants that we've been to in Chicago. I mentioned this to the manager when I called to complain about the issue below and she responded ""that they are busy"". The Very Bad: There were four of us in our party and we split the check in half. Both of us were charged an extra $25 on top of what we signed for after the tip. They fixed it after both of me and the other guy who paid noticed the discrepancy on our account statements. Â They called back and said they would refund it after double checking that we both were charged a different amount than what was on the receipt, but they didn't even offer an apology until I called back to ask why it happened. I spoke to the manager who said that they are sorry it happened and the waitress got a warning. An hour after I called to voice my frustration the general manager called and offered a gift card which I declined since we won't be going back. A better response would have been saying sorry from the start and trying to win back our business when we pointed out they had ""accidentally"" stolen $25 from me and the other couple in our party."
"Girl and The Goat is completely OVERRATED! I mean the food is decent but really $8 per scallop? When the waitress told us it was going to be small plates we were thinking lunch size, these were anorexic size. The staff sucks: they took forever to give us menus, the hostess was very rude. If you have a lot of money to burn go ahead and try this place out but be prepared to spend upwards of $100 a person if you want a decent size meal."
"Somehow scored a same day reservation on open table. This place lives up to the hype. You must get the pig face - sounds nasty but tastes so good once it hits your lips. We also got oysters, cauliflower, goat belly special, spare ribs + donuts for dessert. Left so full and so happy. Would come here way more often if reservations were easier to come by."
"Was here on Sunday night and it was delish. Â Think of this place as fancy tapas -- and be sure to go with people who like to share... My group ordered:goat carpaccio - very flavorful, but not an ample servinggoat t-bone - liked this but served with too much sausagescallops - my personal favorite - they're served with a delish saucelobster with goat belly cauliflower dish - another favorite, but I'm a big veggie fan chickpea fritters - an unique serving of chickpeas three ways and yum!and, you can't go wrong with the bread. The atmosphere is fun and trendy while casual at the same time. Â Not an ounce of pretentious - which I absolutely hate while fine dining. This is a must-eat on the Chicago culinary scene."
"My wife and I were downtown for our anniversary sans children and were prepared to skip this restaurant. Â I never like to go to the most-hyped, trendiest places because of the lengthy wait and great potential for disappointment.At the recommendation of Jess, the St. Germain rep who we ran into at Gilt Bar Friday night, we decided to go around 6:30pm with no reservation. Â Intending to sit at the bar area and finding it already quite crowded, we decided to put our name in and have a drink at Maude's Liquor Bar across the street. Â We were back in less than an hour and ready to hawk a place at the bar when the hostess said she had a table for us. Â The chef's table!We had 4 dishes and loved every one. Â The first was the hiramasa crudo with pork belly, caperberries and aji chili. Â Outstanding! Â My wife(who hates capers and gags when trying to eat a california roll much less think about any sushi or sashimi) absolutely loved it. Â The combination of flavors and the freshness of the fish were out of this world.We followed that up with the pig face, with a tamarind sauce and cilantro and topped with a fried egg. Â I could eat that for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Â The crispy pork, soft egg and tangy tamarind combined for a delicious medley of textures and flavor.The ham frites were delicious also but by the time we got to the bottom of the cone the pork fat was starting to sit a little heavy. Â Still some of the best frites I've ever had.As if that wasn't enough pork, the beer I had was Ham on Rye. Â A smoked rye ale which complemented the meal perfectly.The guys and girls on the line were great. Â Very friendly and happy to tell us what they were preparing.In all it was a great dining experience and the chef's table was a very pleasant surprise."
Amazing!!!
"FANTASTIC!!!!!! Just walked in at 4:30 No Res.Got seated in 15 min.All the greats: food, ambience, cost, etcWould go there again and again, if we didn't live in LA.Lucky Chicagoians!"
"Instead of making reservations months in advance, we showed up around opening time (about 4:30), put our names in, had a cocktail in the couch area, and had a table within half an hour. Something to think about if, like me, you can't commit to anything months in advance.Also, try the cauliflower dish; it's out of this world. Only complaint is the saltiness of many of the meat dishes. After a few courses, the salt became overwhelming."
"It's so consistently good. Â And yes, I've been there more than once."
"By far, the best food- and at a decent price, no less- that I have had in Chicago.I've been there twice in the past month-First time: Goat fat bread with liver butter, escargot ravioli, sweet potato gratin, sausage stuffed calamari, some sort of roasted goat shank, ham frites and the pig face.Second time: Chicken little bread with liver butter and carrot oil, escargot ravioli, roasted cauliflower with mint, pine nuts and peppers, bison butt, goat masala pizza, and bittersweet chocolate cake with shitake gelato and toffee creme fraiche drizzle.I wouldn't say that every dish was memorable, but everything was at least above average and some dishes were almost perfect. I went there once with the sig other, and another time with my best female friend, and we all loved it and agreed on one thing: the liver butter and the escargot ravioli were the two standout dishes. The liver butter was so unexpected, and so flavorful, it was difficult to even try the other spreads that accompanied the warm, flavorful breads. The escargot ravioli was incredibly well balanced- light and perfectly cooked pasta dough, rich and chewy filling, some sort of slightly bitter and refreshing sauteed green, a slightly sweet and rich miso-tamarind sauce that gave a slight Asian flavor, and some sort of fried shallot or onion topping that brought the perfect amount of crunch and saltiness. I also loved the bison butt (although equally well-prepared meet could be found in most decent steakhouses), the cauliflower was delicious and complex (the mint seemed odd but worked so well), and the ham frites were addictive. I wasn't a huge fan of the sausage stuffed calamari, as I found it a little flat compared to the other flavor profiles and a bit too chewy, but the boyfriend liked it, and I thought the goat masala pizza had a bit too much cheese compared to goat and yogurt sauce (although it did make for delicious late night leftovers).Another note: impeccable service! First time, my boyfriend accidently spilled my cocktail. There were only a few sips left, and it was entirely his fault, but they insisted on replacing it. On the second visit, one of the dishes we ordered was actually not supposed to be on the menu, so they brought us another dish for free. First time we sat at a table, and the server was kind and attentive. Second time we sat at the bar, and the guys there made pleasant conversation, gave knowledgeable recommendations on the food, and refilled drinks/ water and took away plates very attentively without being overbearing."
"I'm completely in love with this place. Â Went here last night and made a reservation for later this month with my hubby. Â Got the following with 3 other lovely ladies.- Bread with chimmichurri and lemon butter - delectable- Baby octopus salad - complex yummy flavors combined together- Scallops - the sauce on this was delish, I scraped it with my fingers- Shortribs with edamame - eh, just OK- Green beans with fish sauce - i can totally make this myself. Â I was slightly annoyed b/c I asked the waitress specifically what's the best dish here, and she said the green beans. Â So we ordered, and it was not good at all compared to the other foods.- PIG FACE - we ordered two of these and this is heavenly!!!!!! Â :) Â Makes me happy just thinking about it.- Calamari stuffed with veal and sweetbreads - good, def. not the favorite, but I like the pungent flavors of goat.- Paradelle - not so good, meat was tough and the pasta was kinda flavorless.So you can see there are some winners and losers - but overall, I love this place and can't wait to come again. Â Hopefully my next visit will be 5 stars!"
"Went here on a Thursday night...without a reservation (gasp!) Â Yes..you will wait...a lonnng time...I think we finally got seated at the 2 hour mark, thankfully I had great company and we just killed time at the bar....The Dark and Stormy is decent (but they ran out of rum..who runs out of rum?) Â but not the best I've ever had. Â Pretty decent wine list and beer menu.I was excited to see that they had quite a few vegetarian options...and the goat masala pizza can be made without meat...my friend who was a meat eater raved about the meat version...but both of us agreed that the best thing we ate were the Squash Ravioli and the Rustic Cauliflower...they were sooo amazing!! Â The sweet potato Gratin was really yummy...and the chick pea fritters were fantastic! Â I was sad to see that the pretzel bread was not on the menu, apparently its a Sunday Menu Item.This is a small plates type of place...meant to be shared...the portions are decent...Service is average...I didn't care for my servers attitude...she made quite a few faces (I don't think she liked that I was vegetarian)...and when we got our tab she slammed it down along with the pen which annoyed the hell out of me...but the bartenders and other servers all seemed pretty laid back and fun (i guess we got the crabby one).Definitely think this is a must go...at least once...it is pricey so maybe save it for a date or a special occasion...and definitely call ahead for a reservation (though I hear for weekends they are booked up to 2 months in advance)"
"holy COW. *ahem, I meant.. holy goat.This place is divine. I'll keep this review short and sweet because y'all yelpers could only take so many accolades at the same restaurant. I would return to Chicago just for this restaurant and Crisp. Tips: order everything (over the course of a few visits) This is one of those places where you have a panic attack over the menu because you have no idea what you want because there is no way you could afford the whole menu at once. Â Everything is great. Their servers are charismatic and clear headed and don''t tip monger. Come one, come all. But you better make a reservation long before, it isn't a secret that they're awesome."
"Love the hype of it all and the food is amazing. Â Please try the pig face with a fried egg on top.. delicious! Â Chick pea fritter was also so tasty and because it was my birthday we ordered two desserts. Â I thought I'd prefer the chocolate torte to this blood orange/pistachio cake, but the blood orange was better. Â Stephanie Izzard (sp?) was also out and about at tables. Â We made our reservation a month ago for 10:30pm. Â Coming from the burbs, we had plenty to do to enjoy the city until then. Go... it's good stuff."
"We just visited Sunday night for my birthday. Â The atmosphere of the place is great, albeit a bit loud. Â You can see right into the kitchen, and I want to know how the two people seated at the plating bar with a full view of the line got those seats! Â The food was good, with a lot of flavor and excellently cooked. Â The only small criticism we had is that all the dishes we ordered were somewhat overly oily. Â The waiter recommended 4 to 5 plates for two people, but we were getting pretty full by plate 3! Â That being said, plate 4 was too good not to put in a valiant last effort. Â We didn't order dessert since all the options seemed to have a savory component and I like my desserts sweet. Â Overall, a very good birthday dinner!"
"Best dinner of my life.To some of you, this is going to sound incredibly cheesy. I mean, off-the-charts foodie-nerdtastical. But really, something in me was fulfilled at the end of our evening at Girl & the Goat last night. Maybe it's the fact that I watched the entire season of Top Chef and rooted for Stephanie the ENTIRE time, waited and watched as her blog chronicled the creation of Goat, begged my boyfriend to take us for our four-year anniversary, HAD THE BEST DINNER OF MY LIFE (more on that soon), and when Stephanie came over to talk with us and wish us well for our anniversary, I forgot my boyfriend existed and gushed:Me: If I were a man, I'm pretty sure I'd have to ask you to marry me...Stephanie: That is quite possibly the closest I have ever come to a proposal! But seriously, if every woman in this town doesn't have a girlcrush on Stephanie Izard after dining at Girl & the Goat, there is something wrong with your mouth and your heart. We scheduled our reservations for Sunday at 6:30pm, thinking we'd go grandparent-style and be home by 10. Wrong. Didn't actually leave the restaurant until 10:20, nearly four hours later. Epic, I tell you. We were first seated at a table that we didn't like, so we were promptly moved to the most intimate spot in the house. Marnie, our unbelievably amazing waitress, was so warm and personal and really became a treasured piece of our experience. We asked her for a rundown of the food and wine menus, and really what we ended up with was a tour. We were destined to go completely overboard and she helped us cover all the Goat bases, making sure we had not only an unforgettable experience, but one well-representative of Chef's intentions. So here's what we had (and in no way can words truly bring to life these dishes the way tasting them could):-Roasted cauliflower with pickled peppers, pine nuts, and mint. Topped with parmigiana, this dish was a perfect combination of textures and tastes.-Chickpeas three ways with sungold tomato salad and cave brothers mozzarella. Caprese al la chickpea! Savory and sweet.-Seared scallops with braised veal, caponata, and marcona almond butter. My favorite dish of the night--the scallops were perfectly crisp on the outside, light and spongy on the inside, and the veal bites contrastingly melted in your mouth. Mmmmmmm.-Crisp skate with grilled calamari, chickpeas, grilled radicchio, and tomato aioli. An inventive (and delicious) myriad of flavor.-Ham frites with smoked tomato aioli and smoked swiss. What's not to like when french fries smell like meat?-Smoked goat pizza with tart cherry soffrito, black kale, and ricotta. I'm running out of ways to describe the goat heaven we tasted.-Grilled lamb ribs with sweet onion bbq, grilled avocado, and pistachio picada. Jack's favorite--the richest dish of the night.-Goat cheese bavaroise with brown sugar cake, blueberry, and crisp oats. Nothing more to say.Well, okay, I lied. I do have more to say, and you're probably thinking, ""Katie! Get to the point!"" I mean, honestly, I think I've made my point. Not only has Chef Stephanie created and executed beautiful, thoughtful dishes, she has wonderful representatives like Marnie to present them in their best light. We never felt as though we were steered wrong at any point. In fact, we were delightfully surprised, over and again. And never in my life have I been as close to tears of joy after a dinner as I was last night. Once again, best dinner of my life. The end."
Very trendy place to be...my taste buds were thanking me...
"They do make the food special. Without reservation, the waiting time is unacceptable."
"Food is really good, but the hostesses are rude. Â This is the type of place that is so trendy now that the staff feels like they actually have something to do with it. Â Kind of like Mark Wahlberg's boss in the movie ""Ted"" who keeps putting it out there that he's friends with Tom Skerritt. Â Once I walked in there and there was a two top open right in front of us, several other tables open and they said it would be about an hour and a half wait for a two top. Â No big deal, there are other reservations, I get it. Â But it was how the hostess talked to us that was disappointing. Â Like, are you crazy, do you know where you are at? Â Today I tried to bump up a reservation to like 4:45; already had one locked in for late night and the hostess interrupts me rudely and said ""I have no movement""; I was like, what? What does that even mean. Â Its not so much I don't get they are busy as just beyond snobby. Â Sometimes its how you say something. Â I mean this is Chitown people. Â You aren't making the food at the front of the restaurant. Â Get over yourselves. Â At some point you'll peak and people will get tired of it. Â My bro is an executive chef so I know for a fact you don't have to be popular and as@holes.Food is great...front of the house just a little too sure of themselves...Also, reconsider having take out. Â I realize lots of good restaurants can't, but a lot of good ones also do. Â And get over yourselves a tad..."

"It was good to try but im not dying to be back. Â Its hard to get Reservation Â at this place so we made reservations months back for my bday. Â When we got there we waited for 45 mins. Â  Why take reservations when you end up waiting that long? Â We were about to leave but decided to stay coz it smelled so good. Â BTW, you will smell like food when you leave this place. Â We were seated by the window so it was nice. Â The place is too loud that you really have talk on top of your lungs to have a conversation. Â We ordered the followingsockeye salmon tartare - where is the salmon? Â all I tasted were tomatoes, it should have been called tomato tartareSeared scallop - very goodgrilled baby octopus Â - good but extremely saltypig face - nothing special, blah. Â It took really took a long time to serve this. Â I even thought they forgot about it.braised beef tongue - good and tastyService here is ok. Â Nothing to mention or criticize. Everything here seems to be marinated in salt then another layer of salt then topped with more salt. Â That was the common style in most of the dishes I tries. Â Im not too excited about this place. Â Not one dish is memorable for me."
"Tonight, I went to the ""friends and family"" dinner at Stephanie Izard's Girl and the Goat. Â I'm no fancy lady, just a lucky contest winner, but I am a BIG fan. Â I came in excited... and left stuffed and thrilled.First, the space. Â Since this was a soft opening, I thought it would be still in the transitional stages. Â Not so - this place looks polished and beautiful - giant charred cedar planks were beautiful. Â  A surprise ceiling leak caused some temporary drama, but it was pretty hilarious watching people come up with ways to stop the drippage. Next, the service. Â The excitement was palpable, and the staff couldn't have been more on top of their game. Â It may have been the best service I've ever experienced - it was clear that everyone was as thrilled to be there as we were.And finally, the food. Â The concept is that their menu has 10 fish, 10 vegetable, and 10 meat-focused dishes, but there's a lot of cross-over. Â They're all small plates meant to be shared, and they vary greatly in size. Â My fiancee is a big guy, so we ordered 8 plates and a dessert. Â Here we go...We had:- a bread with roasted garlic, herb oil, and anchovy butter. Â That butter was insane. Â I want to spread it on all my future bread products. - Shaved kohlrabi salad with blueberries, almond, and fennel. Â Tasty. Â - Grilled baby octopus with pineapple, Italian bacon, beans, and a lemony vinaigrette. Â This was one of my favorites of the night, which makes sense, since I love bacon and octopus in anything.- Green beans with some magical butter. Â I don't know what was on these, but we now call them magic beans. I've NEVER had better beans.- Strip steak with onions and a caramel-y sauce. Â It was perfectly rare, but I wasn't totally sold on the caramel sauce. Â Fiancee-o-mine loved it though, and practically licked the plate.- Scallop with braised veal and almond butter. Â An awesome surf-and-turf. Â The almond butter was surprisingly sweet, but I thought it worked!- Escargot with caponata and romesco sauce. We thought this was the one weaker dish. Â The snails were cooked perfectly, though.- Grilled shrimp stuffed with goat sausage. Â Fiancee didn't like it, but that was fine by me, since I devoured it in about 10 seconds. Â I think it was one of the best things of the night - salty with spice.The dessert was the only low point for me, which was a bavaroise. Â  It was just too rich after such a big meal, but I think this is a preference thing.Overall, I was sick excited to try it, and Girl and the Goat exceeded my expectations in every way. Â I consider myself a picky eater, and this is definitely a place I want to write (or, you know, email) home about."
"Designed for trying multiple dishes & sharing. Â Sparkling, dark, energetic atmosphere. Â We tried a couple of the homemade breads, a few vegetables (the green beans were excellent), scallops, mushroom ravioli... Â We were extremely pleased with everything we tried - Rich in many cases, flavorful in all. Â Outstanding cocktails. Â I felt like it was a decent value for everything we tried too - About $80 for a couple of drinks and plenty of interesting dishes to try. It's a great place for a drink & a bite after work w/ friends... Â Would definitely go back!"
"Not that wonderful. Too expensive for the amount of food. Atmosphere too loud and my party of 4 had to eat at separate times. Â Server said that dishes come out ""whenever"" so don't expect all your party to eat at the same time. Â They even forgot my son's order all together. I will not be back."
"I was taken here for my birthday and we had a wonderful experience. Â Service and food was fantastic. Â We had the Peter Piper bread, Chickpeas Fritters, Hiramasa Crudo (pork belly), Goat Chorizo Flatbread, Wood Fired Walter's Chicken, Smoked Goat Empanadas. Â Dessert was the Chocolate Bouchon and the Goat Cheese Bavarois."
"Definitey a great experience and ranks as one of my top meals. The food is a little rich and a little heavy so you cannot eat here often. Â The flat bread and drinks were delish, as was the goat belly, pig face, etc. Â Love the space."
"Confused, mix-and-match ingredients left much subtlety to be desired. Goat liver pate no treat for this foie-gras-o-phile. Interior a tad a abattoir-ish for my taste."
"Fantastic. Â Started with the oysters...bacon horseradish and the egg salad. Â Perfect way to start a meal. Â Moved on to the bloody mary bread- soft, warm, flavorful...again, great. Â On to the kohlrabi salad & the crab stuffed squash blossoms. Â Side bar- when we ordered the squash blossoms I let our server know that I have a soft shell crap allergy- not any other crab or seafood- just soft shell. Â I just wanted her to give a heads up to the chef to keep things separate if need be. Â Her face went white, ""the egg salad oyster was deep fried in the same oil as the soft shell crab"". Â Genuine concern. Â I told her I'd be fine as long as I didn't ingest any shell (though I was a tad worried for a second, until next round of food came out). Â She went on her way and came back two minutes later saying the chef was concerned because the squash blossoms are fried in the same oil. Â I told her I'd steer clear of the blossoms & focus my energy on the kohlrabi salad for the greater good. Â Kinda nice that they actually cared. Â Anyhoo, I heard the blossoms were great- and I was MORE than happy to polish off the salad. Â 4 for 4 (3 for 3 for me). Â Next round scallops with white asparagus and some other love, and pig face with fried egg. Â Oh me oh my....6 for 6. Â On to the grilled baby octopus. Â Not my favorite, nor the favorite of anyone else at the table. Â Quite a bit going on, VERY salty- in my opinion the octopus were lost in the midst of pistachios, fava beans, and a barrage of other ingredients. Â On to the next...confit goat belly. Â Melt in your mouth, focused flavor, soooo good. Â After dinner drinks were a spin on the good ol Caucasian, and did not disappoint. Â They were like boozey milk shakes- glorious. Â Even with the octopus blip, I will gladly give this joint 5 stars. Â You know how sometimes, after leaving a very special dining establishment, you just feel warm and fuzzy happiness from being totally content? Â No? Â Go to Girl and the Goat."
"Different. Amazing. Flavors that you can't believe come out of dishes. Â The place has an old smoke house gone to the quirky side with a Tim Burton flare. Â The grilled baby octopus, sauteed green beans and smoke goat pizza all a must. Â Our waitress was like having a chef wait on us, she was impressively knowledgeable for a group of foodies. Â This is a must when in Chicago!"
"Dear Girl & The Goat, how I love thee. I've been here twice now, and cannot get enough. Every bite we've had is delicious - from the cauliflower dish, to the roasted pig face, and the dish that left me speechless - goat belly with crab meat, lobster meat, and a bourbon sauce. With 2 of us, we had 4-5 dishes and were stuffed. It's not overly pricey - you can have dinner, with a couple of drinks, for under $100. I cannot get enough of this place, and am already planning on when to go back."
"Luckily, we went with friends that knew what they were doing and ordered us a goat leg well in advance of our reservation. Â DO IT. Â You WON'T be disappointed!"
"One of the best meals I've had in quite some time. ONLY issue with this restaurant is that it is so booked that, coming from Boston, we looked 3 weeks in advance for a reservation and it was already full. We waited at the bar and the bartender was WONDERFUL! The second she heard we were from Boston she asked two guys at the end (who were rudely taking up quite a bit of bar seats) to move down for us and she gave us a great experience. Her drinks were as excellent as her service, even letting us sample some beers on tap before we tried them just to make sure we would be happy. The group of us walked all day long to make sure we had plenty of room for this meal so we did some damage sampling a lot of the items on the menu and there was not a single item we tried that received any complaints. I'll book this restaurant a year in advance if I have to. Will definitely go back."
"I came here with a friend on my birthday to see what all the hype was about. Â The restaurant is located in the west loop amongst a bunch of other restaurants, so be prepared to valet your car. Â We had a 10:30pm reservation and were seated upon arrival. Â Now, I do like a late dinner, but even this was pushing it for me. Â I understand though; its a very popular place, you take what you can get. Â The entire restaurant is very dark-dark walls and dim lighting-it made the place feel almost lounge-ish. Â My experience was probably tainted too because my friend and I were sitting right by the lounge area. Â Trendy music played in the background and even at 10:30pm, the place was packed with diners.What I was very suprised to learn (the website fails to mention this whatsoever) is that you dine shared-plate style. Â Call me inflexible, but this is something I like to know before I go into the dinner. Â Either way, it didn't ruin the experience or anything, I just wish the website mentioned this.Our waitor was awesome and pretty knowledgeable about the menu. Â When he explained that my friend and I would be sharing plates, he made sure we double- checked our menu selection with him before finalizing it. Â This was to ensure we didn't order too much food and that we had a nice balance of veggies, carbs, and meat. Â We started with the salted pretzel knot alongside a grain mustard dipping sauce and a thousand island dipping sauce. Â We stuck to the grain mustard-very good start. Â Next came the oysters (with bacon peices) that I agreed to try, but admit I never developed a taste for. Â My friend who enjoys oysters said that they were delicious. Â Even though I was celebrating my twenty fourth birthday, I still spit my oyster out into my napkin (I know-lame). Â Couldn't ever get past the texture. Â When I embarassingly confided to the waitor what I had done, he quickly assured me he, ""wouldn't tell anyone"" and then even took my shamed napkin from me and replace it with a fresh one. Â This was particularly cool to me-the restaurant is not pretentious whatsoever. Â I even joked with him, ""I obviously don't swallow!""Back to the food- Â chickpea fritters were delicious! Â My friend, who would take meat in her desert if it was possible, really enjoyed this veggie dish too. Â We moved on to the ham frites (shoestring salty fries sprinkled with ham ""dust"" if you will). Â In relation to the all of the other portion sizes, this dish was largley out of scale. Â Way too many fries! Â I wished our waitor would have vetoed this choice for us. Â It is definitely a dish to try if you are with a group of people, but at a table for two-don't waste digestive room! Â  The sauteed green beans with cashews were one of my favorite dishes. Â It is one of those dishes I could have snuck off in a corner with and savored by myself! Â The ham of the meal was the goat belly served with a burbon butter and hunks of fresh lobster. Â The dish was small, but so rich that you only needed a tasting. Â We finished with the gingercake with sorbet-it was good, Â but at $8.00, I only indulged because it was my birthday. Don't need it again. Â All in all, the experience was nice. I would have to chalk up the cuisine to upscale bar food. Perhaps I went in with the wrong mindset and just didn't know what I was getting myself into, but I've had my fill of the girl and her goat. Â Trendy spot-but I don't know about the longevity of this place."
"i've heard mixed reviews of girl and the goat but was still really excited when the night of our dinner reservation finally crept up last night.my group of three shared six dishes and a dessert...below is a breakdown:pig face: greasy, saltychickpea fritters: good seafood fideo: MUCH too saltyscallops: salt-citygreen beans: delicious - lived up to the hypepork ribs: i'm sure they were good but by the time they arrived my tastebuds had been killed with saltsorbet + pistachio cake dessert: not goodpositives: i like the menu structure and all of the veggies sounded delicious. my boyfriend's manhattan was excellent.negatives: our server was efficient but not the most friendly. as i stated above most things we ate were much too salty and over seasoned. it also seems like the success and high volume of the restaurant may have gotten the best of the chef, as some of the items (dessert specifically) seemed sloppily prepared with little TLC. how sad!I'd rather go down the street to avec."
"I love the interior, the way open huge kitchen is like restaurant theater. Â The food is very good, but it's gastronomic ADD. Â I would love nothing more than a perfectly composed entree from Stephanie Izard--a big plate with a protein, veg and starch. Â I am over small plates--too confusing to order, you always feel bad taking the last bite, and my small plate ends up having mixed up remnants all smooshed together, blending pigface, egg, harissa, pickled onions...doing no justice to each plate that if it was on it's own large plate, would be perfecto."
"We did not eat here so this review isn't really about the food. I did something at G&G that I've never done before, walked in and walked back out. We arrived late on a Sunday evening expecting a quiet dinner but the place was crazy! People stacked 3 deep at the bar, it was loud, and the bathrooms were trashed. Perhaps this place had a bit too much buzz for its own good. My hipster tendencies recoiled at the site of all the fancy handbags and Jaguars. We cancelled our reservation and walked down to the Publican."
"high-end food in a relaxed setting. Great cocktails, awesome dishes with very strong, sourish flavor. The green beans were excellent."
"I have been to Girl & the Goat several times now and I have always had a great experience. Â The food is fantastic and the restaurant has a great beer list, which is always nice. Â I have ordered a wide variety of dishes and I am continually surprised that the vegetable dishes are my favorites (green beans and chickpea fritters are ordered every time). Â There are also some meat dishes that are especially flavorful, particularly the pork belly with lobster in a butter bourbon sauce. Â While some of the meat dishes have not been as delicious (goat t-bones), they are always tasty and provide an opportunity to try something that you might not try otherwise.Also, at one of our previous visits we had the luxury of sitting at the chefs table and Ms. Izard actually spent a couple minutes talking with us about our meal. Â I am always impressed when the chef takes the time to make sure people are enjoying the restaurant. Â Overall, a great restaurant."
"What can I say about 'The Girl and the Goat' that hasn't already been said? Â The meal was phenomenal! Â Since the concept is small plates my honey and I ordered 9 plates including dessert. Â Mentioning dessert makes me want to review it first; we had the potato doughnuts. Â Seeing as though I love sweets so much that I can literally skip dinner all together and just get right down to the best part, I must say that I may be a bit partial in my dessert review. Â The potato doughnuts were fluffy, light, golden brown, and DELICIOUS!!!! I didn't know what to expect from 'potato doughnuts' but after having those I have decided to promote the philosophy 'LET THEM EAT POTATO!' Â Now that my heart rate has sped up and my eyes are all glassy, I guess I had better tell you all about food as well. Â We had:1. Tortone - A fabulous crusty bread served with the most fantastic tasting sweet onion butter on earth! Â 2. Fat Bread - A warm delicious artisan bread served with liver butter! It is beyond delicious. Â I ate most of it and looked at my honey crazy when he tried to get the last bit of butter. Â Needless to say, he almost lost some fingers. :)3. Roasted Shishito Peppers - Simply delicious peppers, fire roasted and served in a bowl with a fantastic sauce. Â Pardon me for not making note of the name of the sauce. Â It is definitely worth remembering, however in all of my excitement, the name has escaped me. 4. Beet Salad - I'm a huge fan of beets both pickled and fresh. Â The beets and greens in this salad were so fresh and delicious that I almost ordered a second serving. Â This dish was off limits to my better half.5. Skate - If you love whitefish and you are looking for a tasty dish then do yourself a favor and order the skate! 6. Scallops - Plump, fresh, seared sea scallops with the works! Â There was a little bit of goat meat on top that was tender and delicious.7. Crispy Pig Face - A surprise in a patty. Â Crispy coated and fried gelatinous pork served on top of a chimichurri that will blow your mind, what can be better?8. NY Strip Steak- Tender and seared to medium rare perfection NY Strip steak topped with some of the tastiest cucumbers you will ever have. The seafood Â dishes both included Grape Tomatoes that were so special that I needed to write about them separately. Â Even if you don't normally eat tomatoes please try these. Â I would love to know who Stephanie's tomato vendor is. Â If anyone knows, please give me a holler. Â If you are planning a special, casual, girl, or guys night out, check out THE GIRL AND THE GOAT!Thank you for your time."
"Excellent food, excellent service. Nuff said."
"It is A-Ok. Â Was not as impressed as most people are, but would go back if invited."
"Not sure what all of the fuss is about. Â A friend took me there after waiting a while to get a reservation....knowing that I am picky and weird about food and prefer going to the old country buffet this was a poor place to take me. Â The interior was nothing special, waitstaff was very good....and the food on the menu sounded awful to me. Â What I ate would be a poor reflection of what the kitchen is able to do since I modified it to death."
"This is probably one of the hardest restaurants to get a reservation in Chicago right now. Â The Top Chef title really drives people to this place. Â I didn't really watch the show. Â But I was a fan of Marche before it closed, so I decided to stop by to check out the much-hyped G&TG which took over the space. Â Getting a table would as a walk-in will usually require at least an 1-hour wait. Â But if you don't mind sitting at the bar or at the lounge, it is much easier. Â The green bean dish came highly recommended by the waiter. Â I wasn't sure what to expect because the name didn't sound all that exciting. Â But it was excellent. Â The green beans itself was sauteed to a tee (think Chinese-style high-heat saute). Â The fish-sauce vinaigrette was great - big and bold flavors, exotic but comforting. Â I would have preferred the cashews and the shallots to be cooked less (as to preserve textures), but they were great additions to the dish. Â The lamb tartar, in contrast, was more subtle. Â The gaminess of the lamb tartar was tamed by the sweetness of the aioli, and the English pea tapenade added brightness and brininess to the dish. Â A well balanced and pleasant dish. Â The pig face dish was good, but perhaps not as good as the hype. Â The pig face and tongue itself was pleasant enough - tender inside but crispy outside. Â I would have preferred a thicker cut rather than two thinner cuts. Â The fried potato sticks added texture, as did the fried egg. Â The cilantro and tamarind sauce was mild and forgettable. Â Although it was a nice dish, I felt that the presentation was too ""fine."" Â The combination of these ingredients provided a rustic feel, and would do much better if served in thicker cuts and with bolder flavors, or simply served between two buns as a sandwich. Â I was craving the three-little-pig sandwich at Silver Palm as I ate this dish. Â Service was fantastic. Â The waiter was friendly and helpful. Â Decor was rather nondescript. Â It stripped away the whimsical decor of Marche and went warehouse. Â This place is solid. Â Great execution with a flavor profile that is adventurous, multicultural, and decidedly contemporary American. It's not quite 5-star in my mind, but I will certainly come back to see how it evolves."
"We got in on a last minute 9:30 Saturday reservation. Â Beautiful atmosphere--love the design of the place. Â Service was professional, approachable, knowledgeable. Very sceney. Â The top chef winner, Stephanie Izzard was there, giving every plate the once over before it went into the house. Â Very clean, professionally run place. Â  I just couldn't get behind the food. Â The Missus and I looked at every dish as it approached, were seduced by the aroma and appearance of each, and then felt as though something was missing after we ate. Â It may be a complexity of flavors or something that eluded us, or was beyond our purview. Â But I felt like we were the only two people not in on the joke. Â We love good food, and eat out more than I care to admit. Â But I just didn't feel as though the dishes were spiced enough, flavorful enough. Â Which sucked, because everything else about the place was top notch. Â Lastly, when you're spending at this price point, one shouldn't feel annoyed at being charged for bread, flavored or plain. Â But I was, slightly. Â Small thing. Â  I thought that was kind of...not arrogant, but...presumptuous?"
sooo many reviews on this restaurant. Â I know that this one will just get lost among the hundreds of other 5 star reviews... but something must be said. I was nervous that G&G would serve foofy food. Â I hate foofy food (aka a lotta moola for an itty bitty plate containing little to no awesomeness).*drum roll* This is NOT foofy at all!! They offered medium to large sized savory tapas complete with a unique beer selection. I absolutely loved it. Â Go and check it out if you have the chance - its worth every penny.
"I want to give this place 5 stars but since it took us 2 months to get a reservation for 8 and the only time they had available was 8:30 (too late to start dining for me) I go with 4. Also I wished that when you order 22 different small plates and 4 breads they wouldn't all come out at the same time. I felt like the food came out fast and furious and I had so much on my plate I didn't let anything settle before I was on to something else. Overall I must say that we did not order one thing that wasn't perfectly cooked or seasoned. The halibut, chick pea fritters, and cheek were out of this world. The desserts were good, the prices reasonable, and the service attentive but not over the top. If you are a party of 2 definitely request the chefs table. Stephanie Izzard (sp) was there which was also kind of cool. Â Will definitely be back again."
"We experienced some CLUELESS servers. They knew about my many allergies before we came in and attempted to pare down the menu accordingly, but didn't seem to know what was in the dishes at all. Thus I would order something, and it would be coated in butter when brought out. So I'd have to explain my allergies again and they'd pare down the menu further, only to have the same thing happen again when I ordered a second time. ""Ooooh yea, this has BOTH dairy and eggs! Sorry, we're not trying to kill you, we promise!"" said in the most disingenuous way possible. I actually put something in my mouth and chewed before the server came rushing back to tell me it had aioli. A note: I am severely (read: deathly) allergic to dairy and eggs. I KNOW it's hard to try and accommodate people like me, but I'm not asking you to make all the dishes safe for me. Just point me to a dish (or I'll find one myself) that's relatively easy to modify and I'll go with that. But that all goes to sh** if your servers don't know what's in the menu items!Maybe it's because Steph was out of town, I don't know. Terrible experience. I had to take benadryl, and was practically falling asleep for the one dish they didn't screw up. Do NOT come here if you have a serious allergy issue!"
"Great ambience with vaulted ceilings, medium wood tones, open kitchen with beautiful shelves stacked with bowls, plates, etc. Service was great - knowledgeable staff, friendly, attentive, but not overbearing. They replaced out plates at least three times.The concept is a small plates to share. For two of us we got four plates, probably could've gotten by with three. Here is what we got:1) Seared tuna with crumbled lamb sausage, blueberries, and pine nuts. Wow. Delicious and light (everything else we got was quite rich). Loved the flavor combination. I wanted more. Around $15.2) Goat belly with fresh lump crab meat, fennel, in a vanilla infused buerre blanc. Also fabulous. We had to get goat of course and this menu special did not disappoint. I don't think I've eaten goat before and I expected it to be game but it really just tastes like pork belly. The fatty goodness jus melts in your mouth. Generous amount of crab meat well wort the $19.3) Green beans tossed with shallots, cashews, in a creamy white sauce seasoned with fish sauce. Agree with other Yelpers - this is a must have and at $9, a steal. This was a generous serving size.4) Pig face. Yup, you read that right. With trepidation we ordered the pig face. You can only imagine the jokes ... will it have the snout, teeth ... you get the point. Well, you couldn't even tell it was the face. I think they pick the meaty bits off the face (yes, I realize as I type that I sounds a bit gross) and then they roll it around the tongue. I'm not a tongue fan, the texture just gets me. So the meaty bits were delicious but when got the tongue parts, I could barely swallow and the problem was it all looked the same so I never knew what I was going to get. I did a lot of bread and green bean chasers to get that tongue texture down my throat. Anyhow, glad I tried it but wouldn't get it again only because of the tongue part ... makes sense I guess, it was the face. but aside from tongue, pig tastes pig no matter what part you get as I can now say I've eaten from face to tail. Â The dish is $16.Four dishes, bread, and two drinks with tip was around $110.We didn't have reservations (nothing available for over two months) but walked in, put our name on the list, and got a table for two in about 45 minutes on a Friday night around 7:45 pm. Not bad. Worth the wait. And great bar to hang at although it was quite crowded.I'd probably give it 4.5 stars."
"I had high expectations and they were met.We had a group of seven. Â Given the size of the servings and the sharing that is encouraged, I think a group of 4 to 7 is ideal.From the get-go the service was excellent. Â We ordered warm marinated olives and two breads to get started. Â The busta rye was just okay. Â It came with a smoked salmon cream cheese that didn't have much flavor. Â The squish squish was very tasty and the accompanying spread and sauce were good. We had some drinks and a couple of bottles of wine. All good.The menu is divided into Vegetables, Fish and Meats. For vegetable we had beets with a frishee salad (good); green beans (okay); chickpea fritters and mushroom ragout.The chickpea fritters were my favorite vegetable dish. Â They are very light and not doughy. Â The mushroom ragout was my second favorite vegetable dish. From the fishes we choose: crisp pork belly, whitefish, tempura loup de mer. Â The standout was the whitefish. Â It was in a rich wonderful goat chowder with a crisp apple gremolata. From the meats we choose: ham frites, braised beef tongue, goat liver mousse, pork shank, goat ribs, and roasted pig face.The ham frites are just good french fries. I could live without goat liver mousse although the crumpets were heavenly. Â The goat liver mousse was one of my husband's favorite dishes. Â Some people like pate like things. The pork shrank and goat ribs were my favorites among the meats. We were stuffed but did try the bittersweet chocolate. Â The shitake gastrique is interesting. Fun place and great food."
"Well what is there to say except I loved this restaurant and everything about it. It's definitely packed right now, but the atmosphere inside is not overly loud and crowded. We arrived around 6:00 on a Thursday and were able to grab a seat at the bar without a reservation (though I think we got pretty lucky there). We wanted to try a lot of different things so we did end up having a pretty large price tag on our dinner. If I went back again I'd limit myself a little more. We tried the roasted beets (tasty, but included large anchovy fillets which I'm not a fan of), the scallops with pumpkin sauce/pecans/brussel sprouts (heavenly) and the smoked goat pizza with apples and onions (holy yum!). We also tried one of their breads and some cheese and a dessert (yeah we went a little overboard). It was all wonderful with great service to boot."
"I had reservations three months out to try this place and last minute was invited with friends to join them months prior to my reservation. Both my experiences were amazing. There was not one item that we ordered either visit that was not delicious. I thought the chicken dish was on the top of my list with the broccoli but the second time I tried the goat belly and that was superb! The waitress was very friendly and informative which is great when dining at a unique place. If you're patient, it's well worth the wait. Â Looking forward to dining here again :)"
Well I was very excited to try this place. I had heard so much from friends and family in Chicago and I thought the restaurant itself was really cool. Sort of an industrialist take on modern. Very beautiful. The food didn't live up to my expectations. We had a large party and ordered the goat leg. It was tasty but not that exciting. We had a few other dishes including the pizza that was eh. I think for the experience it is worth it but the food.. so-so.
Meh. Â Salty and overated.
"I wanted so badly to give this place a 5th star. Â Balance is lacking, we left feeling very full from intensely RICH food! Â First off they are incredibly crowded, the wait for a table was 2 hours. Â Good news is that they have a lounge area and the bar are full service and first come first serve and we only had to wait around 10 minutes to get a couch with a side table. Â The wait staff was attentive and personable and might i say even, cool? Â Our waitress recommended we get between 2-3 small plates per person. Â Off course we were starving so we got 6 for the two of us, and that was 2 too many for such rich food. Â Everything tasted wonderful, favorite being the soft shell crab which was fried and then placed on a bed of what tasted oddly like elotes (corn with lime etc.). Â Another favorite was the pork belly with a sashimi style fish which had a great flavor combination with the veggies on the plate. Â Beyond those two dishes there was plate after plate of animal lard crisped up which tasted great at first but started to consume us. Â Summary: Â Good flavor combinations, Â very rich food, chef combines seafood and meat which is not often done, busy restaurant with great wait staff! Â Oh, and pricey, but not over the top for the randolph street area."
"So, I feel really bad as this review is long overdue - first time I went to Girl and the Goat was on our first year wedding anniversary, back on March 2010. Ever since visiting, what I consider the best Chicago restaurant, I can't stop raving about it. Every plate we ordered was extremely tasty. It's well worth the 3 month advance reservation and the price. Don't miss this one."
Last week we enjoyed a wonderful dinner and the amazing wait staff at the Girl & The Goat. The atmosphere and wait staff competed for our attention as we dined on taste treat after taste treat. Its novel menu is full of unexpected treats. The valet parking was easily available. We will be back...soon!!!
"This was hands down one of the best meals I have had in a very long time - very fresh, farm to table food - all excellent - love the goat cheese and chorizo flatbread and the cauliflower with pine nuts and the amazing pork ribs!! Delicious"
"Let me say this. It just opened and I have eaten here twice. Granted once was at the coveted Friends and Family pre-dine, but please of please rush over and try and get a seat. The food is amazing!"
"Really good food, perfectly priced, and great waitstaff. Â Not sure why I even try eating out at other restaurants. Â Well its probably because it takes forever to get a reservation."
"Was great, standout was the pig face. Dessert was a bit weird though... whatever we had was really salty and just not the way we wanted to end the meal. However pretty much everything else was great."
"yum! everything here was so good! i didn't get to try the goat leg b/c obviously i want to eat other things instead of some massive goat leg.the fish and chips were really good - it was actually potato chips but they made it w/ taro, sweet potato and potato and the fihs part was made from cod cheeks so it was extra flaky/fattyyummygreen beans were good but not sure why that's the thing to get here."
"By far one of my favorite restaurants anywhere! I tried about 12 different things from the menu and each item was amazing. It was loud, busy, and there are communal tables but it adds to the fun of the place. It doesn't matter, the food is what you go for. It's extremely decadent and perfectly prepared. I'm so happy to have a restaurant like this in Chicago!"
5 stars for hype. 5 stars for formula. 5 stars for gobs of butter and handfuls of salt. 5 stars for noise. the emperors' goat has no clothes....
"Glad I went but will probably never go back. Didn't think it was worth the hype. We ordered many dishes and the vegetable dishes were definitely the best! My favorites, as well as those I was dining with, Â included the sweet potato au gratin, chikpea fritters, and the green beans! Also, the Not so Cambells bread was fun and delicious! Everything else was very forgetable. The biggest dissapointment of the night was the calamari stuffed with lamb sausage. The sausage was tastless and calamari was super chewy. For dessert we had the bittersweet chocolate with shitake gelato which was very good and ended the dinner on a good note since our last round of plates were not very good. However, our server was excellent!"
Great atmosphere and delicious food.
"this place only gets better and better!!!this time i was treated by our business vendor and we were all too happy with the food/drinks/service:we had: sauteed green beans (as good as ever), chickpea fritters, seared scallops, skatewing, sugo, raw oysters, fried oysters, lamb sausage stuffed calarmarieverything was great (small complaint: the food occasionally suffer from over salting) and service was awesomei think i found my fav place in chicago!"
"Amazing amazing amazing. Wish I could make this a stand-by, but I will keep this in my back (or front) pocket for every celebration, ever. In the universe."
"Not sure I can add to what has been said already about Girl and the Goat, other than the meal I had here last Thursday night was in the top 3 of my life. Â  I was a bit nervous that the place would not live up to the hype, but obviously this was not the case. Â  Stephanie and crew were simply amazing."
"I was so excited to try Stephanie Izard's food and boy did it not disappoint. We tried everything from the bread, veggies, pig face, goat belly.. to dessert ( gingerbread cake). Everything was amazing, the ambiance was cool and calm, and the restaurant had high ceilings with the chefs busy on the line in the back.. One of my faves!"
"Girls Night, and we finally got around to wanting dinner. Before we head down Randolph Street to look for something to eat, my BFF says she isn't interested in anything fancy, but perhaps I should change out of flip flops. We compromise, I keep the flip flops on, but tote a Prada bag (should the need arise to smack a yuppie-snob upside the head). Â As Chicago humidity increases, we tend to make fewer compromises. As we head west from Halsted, my thoughts are on trying to nail down something for which I might have an appetite. Then, my Top Chef fangirl BFF shrieks that we are standing in front of Stephanie Izard's restaurant. (She explained the phenomena to me over dinner) As I stand outside with a worried expression on my face, I think it's Saturday night and every table is seated, but then this fella walks out raving about the meal he just had. Â The look on the BFF's face says we are going in and beg-as-needed for a table without a reservation. Â I walk in thinking there is no way in goat-hell we are going to talk our way in, all the while regretting the flip-flops. Â This is not a West Loop casual establishment. The hostess looks at us, then at their full reservation book with a sad look. Â She asks the manager if there is space available for us. Â He also sees the reservation list, but before the BFF falls to her knees, he tells us they have space at the communal table at the back right in front of all the kitchen action. Would we be open to watching Stephanie Izard work all night?... Uh, Yes! Â As we walk toward the back, I notice the dÃ©cor is rustic French with modern touches here and there that give it a chic feel. Â If you are looking for American Continental, you will still like the way different foods are put together, just keep your mind open. Â What we had: Â The bread with Anchovy butter and garlic oil, the scallops topped with veal with a scrumptious butter beneath it, THE goat pizza (See everyone's great review of it), the Skate with calamari, and the fall-off-the-bone Lamb ribs on a salad bed. Â Everything was amazing. Â The portions are smaller (for Chicago) and meant to be shared. Â The highlight of my night were the scallops followed closely by the goat pizza. The wine list pairs well with the menu. Â Girl and the Goat offers an original menu, excellent service, superlative kitchen execution, a wonderful meal, and one should expect to pay for these things. Â This is a 5-star restaurant, and while, today more than ever, we all seek a higher degree of value for our money, this is still a 5. Â I had to do some thinking about this, because I, like other reviewers, was on the 4/5 fence. Then I asked myself... where in West Loop would I take people I want to impress? This is at the top of my list. It's also worth a drive in from the 'burbs if you are a foodie."
"Incredible. Â The place was packed at 5:30 on a Wednesday, but after I ate, I realized that it deserved all the hype this place has been getting. Â The pork shank blew my mind. Â So perfectly tender and falling off the bone. Â Everything was delicious. Â We skipped trying to get a reservation and just ate in the bar area. Â They have a decently-sized bar and a big lounge-y space where you can order off of the full menu."
"To be clear, everything here is really good. Â Good bread, butter, meats, drinks, salads, and desert. Â Perhaps the problem is me. Â My favorite restaurants at the moment are places that serve great fare, in laid back environments. Â The ambiance and crowd here seemed the kind to chase food fads in expensive shoes instead of hunkering down in jeans and a T-shirt to enjoy really good food in a laid back environment. Â Will probably be back, but have other restaurants that demand a return visit first."
"So i'm a self labeled foodie and I was expecting great things from this winner of Top Chef as I've tried many restaurants in chicago, but I was seriously disappointed. Â Especially after we put our name down at 7 pm, went home, came back at 8:30 and weren't even seating till 9:30!Chickpea fritters: We ordered them because of the great reviews and I think they really were the best part of the meal, which can only mean it goes downhill from here.Wheat bread: Â Apparently a special because it comes with fresh peanut butter and an actual piece of honeycomb. Â What it boils down to is the artisan type of bread you get in a paperbag at your grocery store with honey and unsalted unsweetened peanut butter....BLAND.Masala Goat pizza: Â I""m Indian and this tasted like butter chicken sauce with mutton and goat cheese on top. Â It was a weird combo of flavors saved only by the chunks of translucent onions...Passable.Calamari stuffed with lamb sausage: Â Very ODD. Â Calamari was well cooked, sausage tasted like lamb no real seasoning in it, but very ODD together. Â only good thing about this dish are the 4 pieces of sweetbreads you get....This dish is flyover.Baby octopus: Sour!!!!!! Â and Salty!!!! Â tender octopus but really fix that vingarette you are tossing it in. Â Dark and stormy drink: quite strongIf you can go somewhere else, GO!"
"Ya'll mustve smoked a lot of someting before this meal, because I didnt think by any means it was as good as its hyped to be. Its hit or miss depending on what dish you order. Props for using seasonal ingredients and trying very hard, but the execution on some dishes needs work. Choc-o-lantern bread- very fresh and tasty but the spreads werent that flavorful.Beet salad-it was a good flavor combo, but some spots had very fishy aftertastes. Now, I know there is anchovy in the dressing, hence a fish taste, but i never get these powerful fishy bites in ceasar salads so...Scallops-winner of the night, large and cooked perfectly in a tasty pumpkin sauce with some roasted brussel sproutsGoat, Pork, and veal ragu-my personal fave, with very rich flaovrs and textures, definetely get it.Lamb Sausage Calamari- Surprisingly very good. I was a little skeptical, but there was no fishy taste and the calamari wasnt chewy at all. Cauliflower-too saltySkirt steak- chewy and saltyDonuts-Horrible! It was like flavorless pieces of wheat bread in a not sweet enough chocolate sauce. The addition of sour pom seeds was odd. We regretted not getting the lamb shank because it looked really good and was ordered by almost every other table around us. The bussers also were pushy, asking us a million tiems if we were done and they didnt change our personal plates out until I asked.It was just as I suspected, over-hyped. I guess that happens to any place in Chicago doing something a little different. It was expensive, and not too memorable so I couldnt say when Id be back. Mayeb Im spolied from eating in Napa, NYC, etc. but it was a let down."
"If you haven't gone already, GO! Grab a few friends and go. Took my best fren' and we didn't have reservation (cause its impossible to get), so we went to the bar and stalked till we got seats. We got lucky and grabbed seats in the communal table they have by the bar and had a great time. Drinks were awesome; food was great (see rest of reviews below). You really can't go wrong. And parking is actually not that bad."
"I was here about a year ago (why haven't I returned? Â good question.) so I am going to do my best to remember what we ate.Green beans. Â O.M.G. Â I don't even like green beans and I could have eaten 10 pounds of these Â Hiramasa crudo. Â Wow. Â The impeccable slices of fish paired with the salty, crispy pork belly. Â Amazing. Soft shell crab. Â Perfectly fried and served with just the right amount of citrus to cut the richness. Â Fat back with biscuits. Â I never thought I would admit to liking whipped fat, but how can you not like this? Â The biscuits tasted a little stale though.Rabbit rillette. Â Never had rabbit before. Â This tasted like the proverbial chicken but mostly fried. Â The meat wasn't chewy as I've heard rabbit can be but I don't know if this converted me into a rabbit fan. Â Glad we tried it though. Â Roasted cauliflower. Â Another vegetable I don't care for a ton but Stephanie managed to turn me into a fan. Â I would eat cauliflower everyday if it tasted like this!Chickpea fritters. Â I didn't care for these too much. Â They were a bit greasy and lacking in flavor. Â Ham Frites. Â By the time these arrived, we were all pretty full, so my opinion of these might be a little biased. Â I didn't really get a ton of ham flavor - they mostly tasted salty but not overly so. Â I had read a lot of good things about these but they weren't quite what I was expecting. DessertSome type of corn nougat Â - a little salty, a little sweet, a lot bit weird but for some reason I couldn't get enough of it. Â Dragons breath - olive oil gelato and chocolate with beer poured over...I didn't love it. Â I didn't hate it either. Â I don't really know how I felt about it. Â I couldn't bring myself to order the pigs face and no matter how many people say it's good, I don't know if I ever will. Â It just doesn't sound good and when there are so many other things here that do, it's not high on my list of things to order. Â Also - we saw Vince Vaughn when we were there. Â I know the dude is everywhere, but it was just the icing on the cake for a great night."
"ah.may.zing. Great service from the staff I encountered. Dark wood beams and iron fixtures created a cool and cozy warehouse feel. Here's my favorite things (which is most):1. old fashioned, very fragrant with a quality cherry. I like my old man drinks.2. kabocha squash ravioli Â - was spicy (in a cinnamon sense) and creamy and such a strange but tasty mix of flavors!3. pork ribs - so tender. so delicious.4. beet bread with goat cheese butter and walnut vinaigrette - ahhh the beet bread was awesome! Round small loaf about 6 in. in diameter. Cubes of beet sprinkled throughout the dough, which has a pretty cool magenta brown shade.5. PIG FACE. I was the only one in my group who wanted to get this, and I got them all to try (and love) it. Being Filipino, it's not like someone chopped off the face from lechon and put it on a plate. As I understood, it was more of a crossection slice, so it has a bit of cheek, tongue, etc. When cooked and presented (stacked/layered with the potato hash and fried egg) Â it has no distinguishable features that indicate ""Oh, that's a pig's face."" I loved the sauces - cilantro oil, tamarind sauce! Ah, decadent.6. blood orange sorbet with parsnip pot de creme, pistachio cake and fresh slices of blood oranges. like many things eaten during this meal, it was an unexpected mix that turned out to be awesome."
Overall the food was very good but a bit on the salty side.The unique combinations of various ingredients usually worked quite well.I recommend the chick pea fritters and sauteed shrimp. The flank steak was also delicious.Pass on the grilled short ribs. They are a poor attempt at Korean Kalbi and don't even come close. Too salty and the edamame is difficult to eat since its covered in vinaigrette and still in its shell.The napkins are great to wipe your fingers but they shed white pieces on your pants. Folks with dark pants have been warned.
"The good, bad and the ugly!Interesting food, unique flavors, great place to go with a group and try new things. Sat facing the kitchen, amazing to watch a well oiled machine with the team collectively working together to bring out amazing dishes efficiently, effectively, and beautifully.Not a place to go if you have a nut allergy! First was told the items would come with nuts on the side, or that the waiter would clearly look at me and tell me if something had nuts in it. Fine no problem. Â But, it turned out the first 3 or 4 dishes all came out with nuts and was delivered by other wait staff who when asked if nuts were included or not, looked puzzled. Â  I was left eating bread and drinking wine (ok not that bad) while others were oohing and ahing over the dishes. Â I felt bad for our dinner host, (was there for work). Â  We were told the kitchen just wasn't able to bring out things either nut/no nut, or in the correct sequence that would be best suited to me. That's a new one to me! And to add, the dessert came out, we were given4 options, 2 with nuts in them, no biggie. Â There were 8 of us and no serving spoon was provided in the dessert..hello...cross contamination!!Overall, still a good experience, am glad I went, they just need to work on Â keeping that machine oiled when water gets thrown in."
"Hands down best restaurant I have been to in Chicago. Â I was surprised by the mellow unpretentious atmosphere, and liked everything I tried. Â I could live on their green beans. YUM! Â Will go back soon for sure. Â Great place to bring out-of-towner foody friends. Â Pig face is a great novelty."
Loved it... loved the variety in their menu... a lot of vegetarian options. From the bread to our last course... delicious :)
"Was excited to finally get a table on a Friday night to try this place out. Â Was impressed and really liked the dark yet warm vibe but soon realized that conversation is pretty hard given the noise level. Â We were seated on time in view of the frenetic kitchen turning out the 30+ tapas style dishes off the girl & goat menu. Â Here's what we tried:- the loompa bread - Â carrot bread with carrot oil and walnut raisin butter. Â bread had notes of anise and though interesting was rather mediocre.- kabucha squash ravioli with mushroom raisin ragout, brussel sprouts and creme fraiche - very rich and tasty, probably the favorite of what we ordered- chickpea fritters with tomatoes and mozzarella - fried hummus squares with fried chickpeas, well done- seared scallops pumpkin brandade, pecans, fried brussels sprouts, tarragon, pomegranate - the scallops was well seared but what was not listed as part of the dish were the baby cherry tomatoes, which did not pair well with the scallops- smoked goat pizza apple sofrito, black kale, ricotta, cipollini - heavy on the ricotta and very richOverall very creative with variety of veggie, seafood and meat (both goat and pig - i.e. pig face - on the menu ) but from what we had, a uniformity of rich and heavy laden dishes. Â Would definitely come back and looking forward to some more nuance in technique and flavor."
"Not quite a home run, but a solid triple (the reason for the baseball analogy is to both to follow (and disagree slightly with) a prior reviewer or two and for reasons that will become obvious below). Â Went as a single diner while on a one-day trip to Chicago for business. Â Room very energetic even on a Tuesday night (could only get 6:00 or 9:00 reservation) -- I think the restaurant's volume dial must go up to 11. Â  Lots of well-dressed couples and ""girl's night out"" tables.The menu is split into vegetarian, fish, and meat plates. Â Then there is a separate menu with breads (paying for bread is a little irksome, though the one I saw arrive next door looked very good), three oyster dishes, and then other dishes. Â When I asked if these others were ""specials,"" I was told they were ""experiments"" and that this was the Triple A menu, with these dishes waiting to be called up to the big leagues.Well, I had my eye on the goat, veal, and pork sugo on that list but hey, I didn't come to the restaurant to eat Triple A level food. Â So I concentrated on the other menu, choosing a Hamasaki crudo with gooseberries and some kind of lardons, and a bowl of Shisito peppers. Â I then asked for a recommendation on a meat dish and was directed to -- you guessed it -- the sugo.Wait a minute I said, why do I want to eat food that's only reached Triple AAA -- don't I want food that's made it to The Show? Â Well, I was assured, this is the ""Babe Ruth of AAA."" Â OK, sold, since the sugo had been the dish that initially caught my eye.Right after I order , a different waiter approaches the table next to me, populated by friends of his, and tells them the best dishes to order are the fish dishes -- scallops, skate wing, etc. Â Great; now he tells me (well, actually, them).Long story short -- the sugo rocked. Â Nice toothsome pasta with a full flavored ragu, filled with tender chunks of meat and vegetables. Â It was by far the best dish. Â Babe Ruth indeed. Â The peppers, while very good, failed to match the only other bowl of same I've tried -- in a little cafe in Paris. Â Not a fair comparison I know but still slightly disappointing. Â The crudo was nice, but the flavors were a bit too delicate for my taste, leaving me to conclude that the kitchen does meat better than fish (or at least raw fish). Â Perhaps this shouldn't be surprising. Â After all, the restaurant is not named ""The Girl and the Branzino"" is it?Good list of wines by the glass and an excellent selection of beers as well (technically, I guess this is a gastro-pub). Â All in all, quite enjoyable though I did feel I was rushed a bit (not uncommon when dining alone so I don't know whether this is a problem for larger groups)."
"On my second trip, we had a bigger group and it was a great way to try lots of the goodness that Girl and the Goat offers. Â Our server, Marnie, was awesome at recommending items and pacing the service. Â The whole fish was to die for and the pigs face was amazingly tender."
"I was so excited to try this restaurant after all the hype and in the end....womp womp! Â Lots of hype. Â The food was ok but not great as anticipated. Â The descriptions were interesting listing combinations of ingredients that you wouldn't normally think would work together....the vegetable side was surprising the best. Califlower was delicious but def something I could make at home. Â  Everything else...just ok. Â Lastly, a pastry chef is def missing. Â Deserts were not good....not horrible....but not good. Â I would visit again to support our Chicago winner but only with a foodie that wouldn't mind the overly complicated menu. Â The service however, was A+."
simply amazing! Â went to Chicago for the weekend about a month ago and this place came highly recommended... even til this day I can't stop thinking about the mouth watering dishes!rangoon crab stuffed in squash blossomsdiver scallop with foie gras vinaigrettepig face (don't let the name fool you)apricot ice cream in chocolate shell with watermelon granita with pistachio cake chunks!definitely a memorable experience and perfect ending for a mini Chicago getaway
"Andrea our server, the scallops, sugo, cauliflower, pork belly, lord have mercy. All of it was amazing. Go go go go go! It's worth every minute of the wait. Love! This place!"
"As much as I adore Richard Blais, Stephanie Izard's first post-Top Chef solo venture proves just how much she deserved that win. This place kicks a lot of ass and it was doing so in its first few weeks - a time when many new restaurants are still working out their kinks.I was able to snag a reservation during the restaurant's early days thanks to a friend of a friend who happened to have a hosting gig there and it turned out to be one of the best meals I had during my stay in Chicago. The menu is divided very simply - veggies, fish, meats - and while the focus is on proteins of the slightly more exotic variety, the dishes we ordered from each section were equally well thought out. I ordered the chickpeas three ways, the ham frites, the soft shell crab and the outrageously good smoked goat pizza. Everything on the menu is of the small plates variety which is my one reason for taking a star off.... when food is this good, I want more of it."
"holy crap, i started this review in december!!best meal i have eaten in a long long LONG time!!!!! when my parents told me to choose a restaurant for my pastry school graduation dinner celebration, it had to be girl & the goat. i called six weeks in advance and could only get a 4:45 or 10:00 reservation. no joke peeps! with graduation at 9:00 a.m., early bird special it was. best decision i ever made!!! we were some of the first people in the restaurant (they opened at 4:30), and were seated immediately. we had a table near the infamous goat canvas (that thing seriously creeps me out!), with a sweeping view of the dining room and kitchen. i love that chef stephanie has an open kitchen. you can see everything that's going on - nothing to hide here.and even though it's been months since my meal, i can still recount every succulent dish ordered, from the i-would-kill-for-it-cauliflower to the freakin'-orgasmic-pig face with sunny side egg to the melt-in-your-mouth-buttery scallops and the deceivingly-delicious chickpea fritters. every bite made me wonder where i had been eating all these years. why hadn't i gotten here sooner. and when would i be able to return!!the waitress kept trying to push dessert. we kept trying to tell her, we gorged on pastries all morning! she eventually stopped asking. she was cool about letting us stay - we kept ordering, so we weren't exactly loitering. but yeah, we didn't get up from that table until nearly 8:30. so...if you were at girl and the goat that night, furious that your table wasn't ready at the pre-arranged time...apologies. but what am i saying? hell no! i will not apologize for savoring the best meal i have ever eaten. hands down. go go go. you deserve it. and chef stephanie and crew really do deserve the accolades."
"I had a very interesting experience (and ultimately pleasant) at this restaurant. My friend and I walked in at 7 pm on a Friday night, without reservations.They quoted us a 1.5 hour wait, and it ended up taking 2.5 hours total. I complained to the host. They apologized and gave us the best seat in the house--next to the kitchen, where we could watch all of the chefs cook.They treated us like royalty, and we were wearing jeans and sneakers. The food was great overall, and we left happy."
"Middle of the road eatery to me. Â We were on a waiting list for 2 months to get in here and when finally got to go, we were smashed between two other tables of absolutely obnoxious people. Â Now I won't fault a restaurant for having loud and annoying hipster customers, but I do fault the restaurant for putting their tables to close together. Â Basically if I'm paying over $100 for 2 people to eat, I want a nice dining experience, and I don't think you get that here. Â Food was pretty good but I was so annoyed that I doubt I'll ever be back."
"been a couple times and have had the chance to explore the menu quite a bit. Â great service, but i wasn't doing cartwheels over the food like the majority of the yelpers. Â  I feel sometimes it's hard to live up to this much hype, especially when you have to book far far in advance."
"just a few observations. this place is a LOT bigger than i thought it would be. Â Considering it took about 1.5 months to get a reservation before 10 pm, i was surprised at how big it was. small plates, so some will be hits, some misses. Â The chickpea dish was great. Â Not a huge fan of the green bean dish - over salted/flavored. Â the goat was fantastic - but, we were all pretty full by the time we got it. Â I wish it would have come earlier. The drinks were great, and they have a pretty solid beer list."
"I doubt anyone will read my review as there are almost 700 reviews posted, and everyone knows this place is awesome anyway. So I'm going to make my review super short and generic. Definitely some of the best food I've had in a very long time. The service was amazing, and I was pleasantly shocked at the reasonable price. I can't wait to go here again!"
"Oh, Girl and the Goat. I really really wanted us to work out. But I think it's better if we're just friends.K and I checked out G&TG earlier this week. We were super-excited to try it out. We love small plates, we love a good beer and wine list, and let's face it, we love the trendy spots. But for us, I'm not quite sure this spot lived up to the hype for us.We were excited to try a bunch of dishes on the menu, but the overwhelming majority of the dishes we had were waaaaaay too salty. A quick recap:-Hiramasa crudo: good slices of fish, but IMHO the crispy pork belly was unnecessary and overpowered the fish. (yes, I did just say pork belly was unnecessary...perish the thought!)-Roasted beet salad: beets were sliced a bit too thin for our tastes. The avocado creme fraiche wasn't tossed well into the salad, and the saltiness of the white anchovies sort of took away from the subtle flavors of the beets (for me, at least. K didn't mind so much). Sad face.-Sauteed skate: oh, this sounded so good, and our waitress highly recommended it. However, it came topped with a whole bunch of stuff (greens, citrus slices, hazelnuts, some sort of sauce, and I think something else), making the skate soggy! Boo.-Fideos: this was a yummy seafood stew with crispy angel hair-like pasta. The broth was tasty (but salty!), and the fish and shellfish were great. Nice chunks of crusty bread with a yummy aioli to help sop up the sauce.-Sugo: this dish tied with the fideos as my second favorite dish of the night. The roasted goat, beef and whatever other meat had a delicate flavor, and the pasta was cooked well. -Ham frites: HOLY SALT, BATMAN!!! K and I hate to not finish a plate of food when we're out to eat, but after maybe a third of the frites, we were done. The hammy bits were verrrry gritty, and super-salty. The redeeming parts of the dish were the yummy cheddar beer dipping sauce and the smoked tomato aioli.-Pig face: I think this was my fave of the night. The combo of the fried egg, the yummy tamarind sauce, the meatiness of whatever was in the pig face was great.We tried the blood orange sorbet for dessert... while the sorbet was tasty, there was a lot of other stuff in the dish that took away from the tartness of the sorbet. K liked the combo of the sorbet with the creamy ice cream-like goodness at the bottom; it reminded him of an old skool orange push-up!Overall, many of the dishes were too salty for this gal (and I love me some salt!). I felt the subtleties of some of the components were lost, but this didn't seem like a place focusing on highlighting subtle flavors. Maybe some editing on the plate would be good... K and I are curious to see how the menu evolves as farmers markets return with a bounty of fresh produce."
This was amazing. The cauliflower was amazing. The pig face was amazing. The octopus was amazing. So many rich and complex flavors. This is all full bodied food. All the different ingredients really complement each other.
"Incredible service, nice atmosphere, unique food offerings. Â The food we ordered was not overly salty as some have reviewed. Â The pig face was not as incredible as we hoped but still very good. Â The smoked shrimp and pork ribs were amazing!"
"My husband and I ate at Girl and the Goat for his birthday dinner and we were happy we did!! Â We ordered the following: gumball bread, chickpea fritters, pig face, green beans, ravioli escargot, pork ribs and the donuts for dessert. Â They are all small plates to be shared and everything was exceptionally tasty! Â The chickpea fritters had a kick to it, pork ribs fell off the bone and the pig face was so tender!! The atmosphere is fabulous with a very open feel to it. Â We loved that we could see all the food being made and that even Stephanie was back their cooking with her bandana on. Â The service was impeccable at both the bar and the table. Â We will certainly be returning. Â Thanks Girl and the Goat for a great dinner experience!!"
"i couldn't wait to try this place. Â i've been to harold dieterle's perilla in NYC and dale levitski's sprout. Â of course it was amazing! Â i went there with my bee eff eff since it was his last wknd in chicago. Â it was a great send-off dinner - couldn't have asked for more. Â we walked in and expected a very long wait since we had not RSVP'd. Â the host said that we could sit in the waiting/lounge/couch area and eat there if it was available - and it WAS! Â we basically sat and ordered right away and didn't have to wait 2.5 hours. Â the decor is amazing and is totally my taste. Â i wish i lived there. Â we ordered cocktails (i had the drink w/ lime, cucumber and mint. Â it was perfect. Â and my friend had a beer). Â the server suggested we order about 2 items from each column of food. Â we got the chickpea fritters, duck-stuffed shrimp, the scallops, short ribs and the soft shell crab. Â the favorites were definitely the fritters, the ribs, and the crab.mmmmmm mmmmm!i can't WAIT to go back again. Â for about $100, we got all that plus drinks. Â no question, you are getting the bang for your buck."
"Still loving this place. Â The green beans and roasted cauliflower are two of my favorite dishes. Â The grilled octupus, crispy pig face and sausage-stuffed calamari are also delish. Â Can't go wrong with ham frites (french fries topped with bacon powder and served with cheese sauce for dunking). Â Reasonably priced wine list, great cocktails, smart service. Â On the short list of places for dinner with friends...if we plan far in advance!"
"I am normally a very picky eater, but my husband convinced me to be more adventurous, and I'm glad he did! Â Our server, Mark, explained that we should order 2-3 dishes each, and he took care of determining what order to send the food out so the meal flowed beautifully. Â The buenos dias bread was delicious and came with coffee butter (I could eat that for breakfast daily!), and the chickpea fritters were crispy on the outside and soft in the middle to melt in your mouth. Â I'm still amazed at how tasty duck tongues, beef tongue, and goat are--usually I'm a steak girl, but my eyes have been opened! Â We were full from dinner but forced ourselves to eat dessert and had the goat cheese bavarois. Â Brown sugar cake, citrus blueberries, marcona caramel--it ended the meal on a lighter note and was perfection."
"Do not be intimidated by the ""2 month wait list for a table"" rumor going around. Â If you choose, earlier to later than peak times, you may actually be able to walk in. Â Just call first, so you are not disappointed if there is still a wait.The shrimp special was melt-in-your mouth delicious. Â The scallops were fresh and the sauces layered the seafood in flavor. Â The roasted cauliflower had wonderful flavor and was a great light dish in contrast to the rich sauces for the seafood.Our waiter came on a little strong at first, but relaxed as the meal went along. Â  As for cocktails, we both tried what is normally called the ""Pimm's Cup"" and it was perfectly mixed!!!We thoroughly enjoyed our spontaneous trip to the Girl and the Goat. Â Definitely give 'em a call."
"The restaurant should be called the girl and the pork. Â Plenty of pork dishes much to my dismay. The green beans were delicious and the pasta with goat and beef was delicious. Â Lamb ribs good, but too fatty. Â Maybe you have to be a foodie to follow the pretentious menu. Â Menu was not on line so I did not know what to expect. Â Great food for date night, not family night. Totally not kid friendly."
Exceptional service and everything we had was delicious. The skirt steak was the highlight for me.
"I wanted to love GATG but I didn't. And I'd like to give it 3.5 stars...First things first, friendly staff, very welcoming. Sat the four of us at our table and we were literally ON TOP of the people behind us. Put it this way, the man behind me was back to back with me. And not in a pleasant way. He then proceeded to put his arm/elbow back on my chair. How lovely. We couldn't move our table at all because we were pinned up against a glass wall. When he left a pregnant woman came in to that table and she was NOT happy with how tight of a fit it was. I couldn't agree more.I get it. You need to get as many tables in for business. But you're not a $5 gyro joint. We paid $250 with tip for our meal and that kind of meal should come with some room to sit and enjoy yourself. Just a thought.Overall food was good. Some was better than others. Sugo was everyone's favorite. Oysters were tasty. Ham Frittes delicious. Scallops great. Stuffed calamari was nothing to write home about. Pizza was our least favorite. Pig face was well...I gave it a try and I will never eat it again. And I can't even remember the other 2 so that stands for something...Also: why do you have to pay $4 for bread and spread? Anyone??Desserts were yummy but the bittersweet chocolate was just a smidge off--it was good, yes, but not fabulous. Blood Orange Sorbet was an A+, though!Overall it was good food. Some was great. Some was not. I wanted so badly to love GATG as others do...but for me it was an experience and a check off my list. I don't think I'll be rushing back anytime soon. In a city full of fabulous restaurants....you just don't have to."
"I thought this place was pretty interesting. Â The atmosphere is wonderful; modern and trendy and it finds the right balance between ""happenin'"" and ""claustrophobic and crowded.""The food is good, and yet overwhelmingly porcine. Â Pigs are brought into dishes that might not otherwise involve pig-parts. Â Pork is like the WD-40 of this place, used to (literally) grease dishes along. Â Much of the food is so rich with pig-fat that you get full faster than you think you will. Â Also, the oysters are really wonderful. Â  Â The waiters are outstandingly nice, and the beer list is very good. Â But four stars and not five because some of the dishes are too rich to eat-- like the green beans drizzled in fatty fish sauce, and the pork and pork-fat french fries."
"simply put, girl and the goat lives up to the hype. the wife and i had the lamb sausage stuffed calamari, skate with goat belly, pigs face, escargot ravioli, scallops, sesame semifreddo, and also tried a variety of cocktails. everything was terrific, and there are pics of everything we ate in my blog in my profile. overall, we loved everything about the place, and would love to go back next time we are in chicago."
"I am with Ray O. and Anne M. who noted the food is extremely salty, heavy and lacks subtlety. I found the dishes inelegant, confused, too many ingredients glopped together, and way, way too much salt! It was like eating expensive, overrated bar food. The atmosphere is clubby and loud, the ambiance is not that memorable--not a place you are craving to come back to for its charm. Our waiter kind of freaked out at us after we said not that the food was salty; he became rather defensive and said ""I feel like something is wrong here"" when he returned with our next dish...well, yeah, the food is not that great and we're disappointed after all of the hype and her Top Chef win. It was an uncomfortable experience and I woke up the next day feeling gross from the food I had eaten there."
"Disclaimer: I am not writing another glowing review of this restaurant to add to the fodder. Â Though it was amazing and delicious and we were seated next the kitchen where I watched Stephanie Izard's every move and the decor was great and blah blah blah...Rather, this is a warning. Â The format is small plates and they recommend 2-3 per person. Â That is total BS. Â For a group of 6 we ordered 14 plates, many of them veggies. Â We would have been fine with 10, at the most. Â Servings are pretty sizable and I'm still full. Â GO EAT HERE (crispy pig face, chickpea fritters, cauliflower and flounder please), it's worth it, just beware!"
"I kind of can't believe this place has close to 5 stars across the board. I mean it was good, but i wouldn't say this is the best meal I've ever had. The food was pretty good, had the string beans, scallops, and beef rib. The tastes are unique and foodies will definitely appreciate this place. Picky eaters will not like it here. Â Our waitress was a bit aloof. she was a woman of few words and didn't bother to ask us if we had been here before or what the menu was like, for example letting us know it was smaller plates made for sharing. You would think that would be the first thing they explain to you but i only knew from reading reviews prior to going. Also, our water glass got filled up a thousand times, we literally didn't go 2 minutes without our glass being filled up, it was a bit too much. It is not easy to get a reservation here, i happened to look the day of on Open Table and found one spot open, which was not open when i looked the week prior. Also, you will leave this place reeking of a bacon smell, my clothes still smelled the next day. The atmosphere is pretty cool however, open kitchen, simple but artsy decor. The prices were very reasonable.i will say good but not great, these reviews are highly overrated."
"Went here as the only meat-eater among a group of vegetarians. We stuck with the veg options. Â Great food, non-intrusive but attentive service, and vibrant atmosphere. The only problem is that it's so hard to get a reservation."
"I really want to e-mail YELP to ask them to add a ""6th star"" or ask them to let me revise my previous 5-star reviews. Â Girl and the Goat really is in a class of itself.I was only in Chicago for a few days, and without reservations, I had to strategize. Â They opened at 4:30, so I showed up at 4:15 (they weren't officially open at the time, but they were kind enough to allow me in). Unfortunately, going early doesn't mean I'll get a table, but only get waitlisted if there are no-shows. Â That wasn't going to cut it, as I had a plane to catch early in the evening. Â Hence, my gf and I sat at the bar, which served a full menu. Â The FoodSeared Tuna - Now seared tuna is one of those dishes that restaurants always seem to be make well. Â I mean, as long as the fish is fresh, almost any sauces or sides paired with it would taste good. Â So how does Girl and the Goat make this dish amazing? Well-seasoned lamb sausage paired with grilled blueberrys topped with pepitas. Â Very impressive combination of flavors - the rich flavorful sausages was complemented by a taste of sweetness from the blueberrys on top of the seared tuna with pepitas giving a bit of a crunch to it. Â 5/5Sauteed Green Beans - What makes this dish different from other restaurants is the fish sauce vinaigrette. Â The sweet and sour sauce not only added a very unique flavor but also seemed to bring out the sweetness of the sauteed green beans and onions. Â 5/5Escargot Ravioli - The night before, I ordered Escargot at the Publican and my review of the dish was literally (Escargot - meh). Â I really was hesitant to order it again, but it looked too interesting to pass up. Â And boy was it the right decision. Â The ravoli held in the buttery garlic flavored escargot, and allowed for the bacon and tamarind - miso sauce to complement it. Â Really added another dimension to the dish. 5/5Razor Clams - Now I wish I studied the dish a bit more before scarfing it all down, so I know I must have missed out on some other ingredients. Â However, what I did note is the razor clams were very fresh and had a hint of sweetness to it before being topped off with peanuts and a vinaigrette-like sauce. Â I would have been satisfied if the razor clams were simply cooked with garlic, but Stephanie Izard proved that she can make a good dish great. 5/5Confit Goat Belly - Might be my favorite dish of the night. Â The piece of goat belly was so tender it practically came apart on its own at the touch of my fork. Â But no, it was far from ""mushy"". Â The goat belly must have been pan-fried as it was very crispy (but not burnt) on the outside and juicy in the inside. Â And what did they pair it with? Â LOBSTER AND CRAB topped with buttery cream sauce. Â Wow. Â Literally a symphony of flavors. 5/5I honestly spent the next hour after dinner raving about how good the restaurant was. Â And spent the better part of my week sharing with everyone here in LA about this gem. Â Most of the time, restaurants have one or two signature 5-star dishes. Â For Girl and the Goat, all the dishes they brought out were 5-star material. Â You know when you ask the server ""what's good?"" in a restaurant, they respond with Â ""everything"", well finally, I've come to a restaurant where that was true."
"When we initially called to make a reservation here we were told they were completely booked out. However, not to be deterred, we walked in around 10pm on a Sat. night and were able to get a walk-in table within 50 minutes or so. We are certainly glad we took the chance and walked in since it was one of the best places we have eaten in Chicago. The Girl and the Goat goes well beyond exceptional food by providing an inviting & exciting atmosphere with truly world class service. After stuffing our faces on multiple appetizers, entrees and champagne we were perusing the dessert menu. I made a comment to my girlfriend that this one particular desert looked good but I was way too stuffed to even think about eating it. Our server over heard me say that and I brought it out to the table completely free of charge. He said that he wanted to make sure we got everything that we wanted. What I really really wanted was someone to carry me out of there after we were done eating! Absolutely fabulous in every way!"
"Our favorite restaurant in Midwest. If you can get there when they open, you can still get a table :) Everything you eat there will be exquisite."
This is an awesome place with am amazing service. Â Stephanie came to our table and spend some time with us Â and ordered a few entrees that we did not get and also gave us a complimentary sample dessert tray. Â She really is awesome and runs a great restaurant.
"As good as it gets, if you're into the new foodie meat scene. Â The place itself is very cool and has a lively bar. The service was the best I've experienced in Chicago, hands down, from the hosts to the food runners. Â And the food. Oh my gosh the food. Our normally chatty group did nothing but chew and oooh and ahhh over the food for the whole meal. Â I'm not usually a fan of bread but their bread was fresh baked and delicious, and came with a side of beer cheese dipping sauce. Yes please. The mushroom ragout was my least favorite thing we tried. Too much pasta and not enough flavor. The escargot ravioli was fantastic; my crew had never tried escargot and I'd only ever had in its traditional form, but this was a treat for us all. Â The hiramasa crudo with pork belly was amazing. Â Succulent raw fish (it's yellowtail) with crispy pork belly (just how it should be) go together like you wouldn't believe. Fantastic! Â The beef ribs came right off the bone with no effort -- amazing. Â Of course we had the pig face, because you can't come to a place like this and not go out on a limb. Its not as scary as it sounds; it looks like pulled pork and tastes divine. A must try. Â As for desserts: Â I preferred the desserts at Purple Pig. Â But I'm not a huge dessert person so I'll leave that to you. Overall, one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Â And I dig how young and vibrant the vibe of the place is. Â Totally worth it all."
"High end food at affordable prices, award winning interiors, and great service - The Girl and the Goat does it right. Â Tried 6 dishes based on chef recommendations plus dessert - everything was very good - it is hard to pick a favorite. The wood fired oysters were the least exciting of the bunch, but still good. Â They were still seating tables at 11pm on my Saturday night visit and I hear it is packed like that every night. Â Make sure you make a reservation. I think the wine list is a bit short and pricey, but you could still get out of here with 2 plates and a glass of wine for $30. Â Which is a smart way to get high-end food into a low end economy."
"Not impressed with the dining room...weird layout, strange choices for artwork, and that giant divider in the middle of the room??The food was quite good and interesting, but some of the dishes pushed the envelope in a way that doesn't quite work, perhaps like the dining room itself."
"Make a reservation and just go!!! What an amazing experience!! By far, the best meal I had in Chicago (twice)!! If your a big foodie head, this is the place! I promise!!!"
The best restaurant in chicago so far. The food is outstanding! all of their desserts are very good!! Â I can go there every weekend
"I've dined here twice, and as I like to say, it was good, not great. We tried plenty of the dishes - the green beans, cauliflower, octopus, sugo, etc, but I just found most to be a bit shiny (aka greasy) for my taste. There were some inventive flavor combinations, but overall the dishes didn't wow me as I thought they would. It didn't help my grapefruit martini left quite a bit to be desired. Too bad, so sad. Look for me around the corner at Avec, Publican, or Davanti instead."
Wow do yourself a favor and order the fries!
"We returned to Girl and the Goat for a birthday dinner last week. In my previous review, I was upset with the way they handled my boyfriend's gluten allergy. This time, I'd like to compliment how they are dealing with gluten allergies. They now have what I would call a gluten-free guide to the regular menu. It's the items on the regular menu that are gluten free as well as items that have ingredients that may contain gluten (each is labeled as to why it may contain gluten, so the person with the allergy can make the call). Â Once our server knew of his allergy, she made sure anything that was prepared differently (or had things omitted) because of the allergy was brought straight to him which eliminated any confusion/contamination issues at our large table. They have gluten free bread which is nice for those with gluten allergies when the rest of the table is enjoying the bread menu. Instead of just improving how they handle gluten allergies, they are now taking care of their gluten free guests better than most restaurants with gluten free menus. Which, of course, makes sense. Girl and the Goat is a fantastic restaurant with amazing food, so why wouldn't their gluten free approach be just as high-quality? We already have plans for our next dinner there!"
"I love this place...I really do. Â It's probably a good thing it's constantly booked otherwise I'd be dropping serious money here all the time. Â Everything is good, I mean really good. Â The atmosphere is amazing and the open kitchen is a lot of fun. Â I've been here only twice but both times completely wowed me. Â The first time was just after it opened and before it become super popular and the second time just recently, and I was lucky enough to walk in and get a seat at the communal table with my two lovely dining guests. Â The cocktails are great and I'll say it once again, you can't go wrong with ANY of the food. Â Try something you normally wouldn't try. Â Chances are you'll love it."
"This has been a favorite of mine since my first visit there last fall. Â We went after a Bulls game and did not expect a table. Â We were delighted when the owner, Ozzy introduced himself and gave up his seat at the kitchen window. Â  It was an interesting experience to see how the food is made and to be able to ask questions (and taste samples) while your food is being prepared! Â It is a different experience than sitting at the table - but one I would recommend you try! Â I also love the fact that they support the local farms and that Chef - Stephanie Izzard - actually goes to the farms to see the living conditions of Â the animals and how they are treated. Â  Since I rarely eat meat, I like the ""idea"" that the animals had a good life prior to ending up on my plate (I know, I know...I digress)! Â A favorite dish: sauteed green beans . fish sauce vinaigrette . cashews. AND Â seared scallops . brown butter XO . bok choy . shiitakes . white asparagus ~ YUM!"
"I've been looking forward to dining at The Girl and the Goat since they opened, and had the pleasure to do so on Saturday with my husband and six of our closest friends. Â Atmosphere is comfortable but hip (not obnoxiously so), high ceilings and a rustic yet modern look (it is quite loud in the room though). Â Loved the open kitchen, and loved the fact the Stephanie was visible and expediting the food just steps from our table.We were sat right away for our 7:30pm reservation (make sure to make reservations, this place is busy) and had a great table - right by the open kitchen and right by Stephanie. Â And the tables are large, we were not crammed in and certainly had enough room for all of our plates. Â Lot's of action going on...Since we had a party of eight we were able to try a number of dishes:- All three breads - My favorite was the wheat with lemon honey butter and honey/honeycomb, but they were all delicious, hot and very fresh. Â I think these change on a regular basis though. Â It's just a shame we have to pay to get bread and butter on the table...- Hiramasa crudo with crisp pork belly - I really liked this dish, but I could have eaten it in 3 bites as there was not much on the plate. Â The fish was fresh, buttery and sliced super thin, and the crispy pork belly gave it a burst of flavor and fat. Â Wonderful, yet tiny.- Oysters (raw)- Soft shell crab - This was a hit at the table. Â Very light, crispy batter and cooked perfectly.- Baby octopus - Very salty, but good. Â Again, cooked perfectly and not overdone (which is so common with octopus)- Skirt Skirt Steak A La Plancha - Hated this! Â It was the ""safe"" option, and I could tell. Â It was like Chinese pepper beef, but not as good. Â Overdone, chewy strips of beef, and not appealing in the least. Â Only redeeming thing on the plate was the beets.- Smoked goat pizza - Very flavorful, I really enjoyed this- Rabbit Rillette - This was actually worse than the steak. Â The rabbit had a mealy, grainy texture and not much flavor. Â Perhaps that's just how rabbit meat is? Â I'll stay away from eating Bugs Bunny forever from this point on, serves me right for even trying it...- Chickpea Fritters / Chickpeas 3 Ways - MY FAVORITE!!!! Â AMAZING! Â I loved this dish, and I don't even really like chickpeas. Â The fritters were crispy on the outside and melt-in-your mouth on the inside. Â The fresh mozzarella was amazing, as were the heirloom tomatoes (tangy and sweet). Â And the little fried chickpeas were a tasty treat as well. Â Everything combined made this such a flavorful and thoughtful dish, and it was the only 100% vegetarian item (I think) that we had, I can't believe it was my favorite. Â It's so easy to make pork or lamb taste rich and flavorful, but they took simple chickpea and transformed it into something wonderful. Highly recommend.- Sauteed Green Beans - Very tasty, I think my #3 dish. Â They were pretty salty though, probably a result of the fish sauce, but super flavorful. Â My husband commented that they tasted like meat, this was his #2 dish (and that's saying a lot). Â Also highly recommend.- Crudo - this was a pasta with a veal/beef/pork (I think) ragu...it was okay. Â Not something I would order again, but this was my husbands #1 dish.- Crispy Pig Face - I didn't have any of this one as the other side of the table ordered it for themselves, but they did say that it was tasty. Â I don't like the idea of this dish though, I suppose I have a bit of a squeamish stomach and the name / ingredients do not do anything for me.- Nougat (desert) - YUM! Â The nougat itself almost tasted like slightly frozen marshmallow fluff - but better. Â The ""sauce"" on the bottom was weird though - it tasted like pure vinegar, and when you're not expecting that flavor it's really a weird, unpleasant taste. Â Goat cheese ice cream with brown sugar cake and berries - another YUM! I know this place has been hyped up... but this was a great experience, a tad pricey for what we got, but we had a great meal and a great time."
"My husband and I went for our anniversary and had a great night. The service was excellent. The hostess greeted us with ""happy anniversary"" and our server brought us each a glass of complementary champagne. The food was all good, but looking back 4 days later, one thing doesn't really stand out. The service may have been better than the food, but I will certainly be back...if I can get another reservation :)"
"I recently proposed to my girlfriend at The Girl and The Goat in the Underground Goat (the private dining room downstairs) that also functions as their wine cellar. Let me tell you, the cooperation I received from the staff and the willingness to help was SPECTACULAR. They were able to supply the candles, referred me to their florist (Lisa Paul @ Color and Company), and of course, served excellent food. We had two servers dedicated to our group of 17, they kept our water, champagne, and wine glasses full. They answered any and all questions and we were able to request more of any one particular dish we liked. We were stuffed by the end, bordering on force-feeding ourselves. One of the best things was that Chef Izard was so nice to stop by and offer her congratulations even on a busy Saturday night. Super down to earth and by far our favorite top chef. This was only one of countless meals that we're going to have here."
"Omg! I love the food here! Eating the bread is like eating butter ready to melt in your mouth. Three of my friends and I went here to celebrate after finals. We order half the things on the menu, because they're not a large portion. Wine selection is really great too. Good place to mingle with friends, and a very wonderful atmosphere. The last time i went there is was pack, i would recommend anyone who want to go here to make reservations."
"We managed to get a table for 4 without a reservation because someone with a reservation did not show up. We ordered 8 small dishes plus bread. Everything was unique and delicious. I particularly liked the chickpea fritters - great texture. Although I do not eat pig, my husband's favorite was the pig face. Also noteworthy was the tongue, roasted cauliflower and the crab. Our waitress was excellent in recommending dishes and wine -Great dining experience!"
"Go with a small group so you can try more dishes (most dishes give you 6-8 spoonfuls of food and the dishes under the oyster and bread categories are portioned out for 4 people if that helps you to decide how many in your party). Â I went with a party of 4, we each got a different cocktail (they were all very delicious), 12 different dishes total and we were completely stuffed by the end. Â Get the dishes with the craziest looking descriptions (shitake gelato with your chocolate dish?) because those are the ones that inspire you the most. Â Just because it's a shared plates place doesn't mean its cheap though - the bill adds up but I think it's worth it. Â Go with low expectations so you are pleasantly surprised with every dish that comes out!"
"Excellent experience all around. Got there about an hour early for a reservation, so I got to spend some time at the bar. Nice bartenders and a great wine and beer list. I'm a beer drinker myself, and it was nice to see a list of craft beers that wasn't just Belgians and IPAs. Had myself a Brooklyn Lager and a fine time.The meal was excellent; we had four people and ordered nine dishes. Pretty much all of them were outstanding, save one that just didn't impress. We had the following:- Smoked Goat Pizza. A bit larger than most dishes, so good to share with 3-4 people. Great flavor and a nice delicate crust, almost flatbread-esque.- Roasted Pig Face. Tasty enough, although I'm not much of an egg eater.- Ham Frites. Absolutely delicious, and the ham flavor wasn't nearly as overpowering as I expected.-Roasted Pickled Cauliflower. Not sure if that's the official name, but you get the idea. Â This was the only dish on the menu that didn't impress us. Â It tasted like...well, roasted, pickled cauliflower, which isn't terribly mindblowing. Â The waitress recommended trying the cauliflower or the grean beans. Â I'm not sure what the big deal was. Â Maybe the green beans are better. Â Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad, but very acidic and underwhelming.- Squash Ravioli. Â Absolutely the _best_ thing of the evening. Â So many flavors working on a lot of levels in this dish. Â I went in knowing I would order this, and the rest of the table agreed that I had chosen the best item.- Lamb Sausage Stuffed Calamari. Â An interesting item, lots of flavor, and the calamari had an excellent texture. Â Not my personal favorite, but people liked it.- Beef tongue. Â Medium texture, good flavor. Â I'm not a fan of tongue myself, but a companion ordered it and liked it a lot. Â That's about all I can say.- Chickpea fritters. Â As we all know, anything fried is always delicious. Â These were no exception.We also tried the gluten-free bread, since one of our fellow diners has that issue happening. Â The bread was good, but very crumbly, as gluten-free bread tends to be. Â I would liked to have tried one of their regular menu offerings, as so many people seem to like them.Really, the only ""complaint"" I had was that after a while, I felt like the service was _overly_ attentive. Â One of my friends said she had never heard of such a thing, but I have definitely seen my share of waitstaff who, instead of ignoring your table, almost never leave you alone. Â To be clear, our waitress was excellent; she knew the menu, made good recommendations, and was attentive. Â However, since they bring the food out in flights, rather than all at once, it seems like there is someone at your table every 3-4 minutes, which makes it a bit difficult to keep a conversation going. Â But obviously, that's a minor thing.In short: great food, good atmosphere, absolutely worth the price."
"Ordered 6 dishes and 2 breads for 2 of us, and left stuffed. The scallops were a highlight. The gluten-free bread was also a very pleasant surprise. One confusing item and the only downer of the evening was the ham frites - there is ham powder on the fries, but we were expecting something more along the lines of steak frites since it was in the Meat section. The food runner had a bit of attitude when I asked about the dish, informing me that frites are fries (thanks dude, I was wondering where the ham was). I wouldn't order them again since they were filling and there are many more interesting items on the menu."
"Great food experience- heavy on the salt- you will be bloated the next day. The pig face is a MUST try- do not fear it-- it is really amazing! Â If you like gin- ask for the ""Aviator"" a drink that is not even on their drink menu- you will not be sorry. Only downside was the fact that the tables in the middle of the restaurant (not the ones against the walls) are ridiculously close together- so much so that you cannot back your chair up without smashing into the person at the table behind you- and the same goes for them-- the owners are clearly trying to capitalize on the hotness of this restaurant by packing in as many patrons in as possible- which I appreciate, but the cramped and uncomfortable nature of our seating arrangement took away from our experience."
"I'll preface my review with stating a fact: I had to wait four months to get this reservation. Let me tell you why Girl & the Goat warrants 5 Stars: -""Better than Campbell"" Bread, made with cream of broccoli soup as a base. Odd. But so damn RICH and tasty. The side better and compote was interesting and made me think of tomato soup. Better than Campbell's, I think SO! -After the first round of bread being so good, we decided to order ANOTHER kind of bread. Yes, we were glutton for punishment! So we tried ""Squish, Squash,"" a crusty bread with a buttery taste and based with spaghetti squash. Light, flakey, and delish when paired with the creamy buttery sides. -First appetizer was the ""Chickpea Fritters,"" these delicious little bites of fried hummus melted in your mouth. The goat cheese sprinkled on top was a perfect flavor accompaniment. -Next came the ""Lamb Stuffed Calamari."" I think if I had to have 1 thing before I died, it would be this. The calamari were long tubes stuffed with incredibly flavorful, and not fatty at all ground lamb. Calamari itself was cooked to perfection. Add on the sweet garlic sauce drizzled on the top, and it was heaven. -Our first entree was one of the nightly specials, the ""Whole Fried Fish"" a Mediterranean white fish, topped with house made clam chowder. The fish was deboned *YAY* and the chowder actually made it taste like a fancy play on ""Filet'O Fish."" I would never, ever eat at McDonalds...but this actually made me laugh and smile a bit. -Next, we sampled the ""Goat Masala Pizza."" At this point, I was glad to know it was our last entree, but was so happy they saved it for last. Let me tell you, it was amazing. Best pizza I've ever had. The crust was perfect, toppings were all well portioned and the flavor combinations were off the chart. Even after all of that, we managed to squeeze room in our bellies to share 2 desserts. The Bourbon Apples, and the Blood Orange sorbet. While the Bourbon Apples was good, it was agreed that the Blood Orange took the title for best dessert. For all this plus 6 drinks, our bill was only $160. How the HELL?! *Insert happy dance here* I have to say, Stephanie Izard...you have very, very pleasantly surprised me. The quality of food, flavors, service and prices all live up to the hype. In short....was it worth the wait? HELL YES. As a matter of fact, I think I'm going to go ahead and make another reservation so I've got my next visit on lock down."
love small plates of deliciousness! Â Please forgive me for not naming dishes. Just go and enjoy. nuff said
"I don't think there is anything I can says about the Girl & the Goat that hasn't already been said! Â I ate here with my family for my brother's 21st birthday. Â It was FANTASTIC. Â We had the sautÃ©ed green beans, diver scallops, escargot ravioli, ham frites, pig face, pretzel bread, kingfish (I think that's what it was called, it was a white fish and not on the menu), goat sausage pizza and beef tongue. Â The only thing I didn't try was the escargot. Â Everything was so incredibly delicious. Â I highly recommend coming with a large group so you try as many dishes as possible. Â I also recommend booking your reservation WAY in advance. Â I booked my reservation for 5 people at 8 pm on a Tuesday THREE months in advance. Â I literally stalked the date it would open on opentable and waited. Â It was totally worth it, as I have had friends who ate there at 11:15 pm or some other crazy late time. Â The other suggestion I have is to have a TOTALLY open mind. Â Don't think about what organ anything is. Â Just eat it! Â I absolutely loved the pig face, and quite honestly, the idea of eating ANYTHING'S face grosses me out. Â I really have to applaud the servers for doing a fantastic job. Â Our server was very helpful, informed but totally non-invasive. Â He arranged our dishes from lightest to heaviest, and he frequently checked on us to make sure we were all set on drinks."
"FANTASTIC FANTASTIC FANTASTIC!!!! Totally worth the late reservation time! Not the place to walk into for a bite, plan ahead for this one folks, but it will be totally worth it. Â My husband and I came here for a special date night dinner. Â We had a very LATE reso but it was ok. Â Do not get wine by the glass here, way too expensive, your better off going for a bottle and getting two glasses instead of one! Â Food and service were both out of this world! Â We got sat on the line where you can watch the chefs prepare all the food. Â Joey was the cook working the station that night, and he was so nice and answered all of our foodie questions for us! Â Andrea was our server and she was very sweet as well. Â She would come by with little treats for us in between courses, which was amazing. Â The Chickpea Fritters are SO good, the mussels were amazing, Â EVERYTHING we had was out of this world! Â If you are a foodie in Chicagoland this place is a MUST!"
Ordered just about every item on the menu for our party of 8 and each item was a hit.... but one item in particular stood out for me : the goat liver mousseline. OMGoodness..... OH MY GOODNESS. Fantastic. I am in love with this girl and her goat!
"A spacious welcoming space made me think we were going to like the place before we even got seated. We arrived early for our reservation and ordered drinks in the spacious bar area where there is bar seating and a separate area where people can stand and put their drinks down. There is also a living room like seating area where 10-15people were sprawled eating their dinner. Â I ordered the aviation cocktail which was a very balanced mix of Plymouth gin, Creme de Violette, Maraschino and lemon. Â I wouldn't have guessed there was Creme de Violette in the drink but it had a light citrus flavor. We also had the Sazarec with cognac Â and absinthe served in a glass. The absinthe dominated but the drink was still balanced. Â The Jardin, a Margarita like drink with St Germain which was also quite nice. Â Our waiter was somewhat robotic and seemed to have a reel of tightly practiced speeches that he turned on given the right question. Â But he was efficient and thorough in his answers. Â He suggested at least 7 dishes for our group of four because they are served family style. But this was probably at least one more than we needed. We were glad to have ordered them though because we got to try lots of things and we liked or loved most of them.The dishes we liked least included the pig face which does not resemble a pig's face in anyway but seemed more like a bunch of fried pork fat (maybe a pig's face is all fat?) kind of overfried until its crispy topped with a sunny side up egg. The waiter billed it as ""breakfast, lunch and dinner"". We thought it was overrated, greasy and not particularly good. We didn't finish it and it was one of the smallest servings.I didn't like the skate either. It was too fishy. But the other three in our party did like. They agreed it was fishy but felt it was flaky and flavorful.Those two were the least appealing to me. Â After that, the remainder were all good or great until dessert which generally sucked. Just a quick note about it. We ordered three of the five offered: the date cake was inedible, dried out and without any flavor. The shitake gelato was served on thin, dense layers of chocolate cake which were edible but had an odd grainy texture. And the gelato tasted kind of like vanilla with no semblance of shiitake (which was maybe good). The other dessert was kind of a cranberry apple parfait which was okay.Now that we have that disappointment out of the way, I'll focus on the many dishes we really liked. The chocolate bread (one of a choice of three breads) was served warm, fresh and tasty and was actually a kind of good compliment to the rest of the dishes. Even though I didn't think it was wonderful, I felt like it worked. It was served with guajillo butter and pumpkin butter. Â Shishito peppers were served pan fried with parmesan and there was lots of the parm coating the peppers. These were mild, tasty and very eatable.The goat loin was very good. The goat meat is chewy but flavorful served with a cherry soy sauce. I was very glad we tried this because I tend to think of goat as gamy and this wasn't.We also had green beans which was a huge serving with cashews and shallots and fish sauce. They were the thin french haricots vert style beans which made each bite more flavorful.My favorite dish though was the ravioli with braised pork and tempura mushrooms. The dish really worked well with all its pieces. There are only two ravioli so be prepared to eat a small serving if you are sharing. Â One of the best dining experiences we've had in a while. We just won't order dessert next time."
"Made reservations over one month ago and was really looking forward to a great dining experience. The food was excellent but I gave it only 3 stars because the service was not. Perhaps we just caught someone having a bad night but she practically rolled her eyes when we asked for help with ordering and disappeared pretty much for the remainder of the meal. We had to ask another staffer to get the bill. It was so noisy, we had to scream at each other. Dinner on two other occasions at the Purple Pig also had fantastic food, but well served with lots of enthusiasm."
"Went to the girl and the goat with my Sister before the blackhawks game on sunday night. When we entered the door we were greated by a fantastic wood fire smell. Already being rather hungry the smell only made me want to eat that much sooner. Being early we were asked to sit at the bar and have a drink before dinner. After waiting only a few min we were seated. Our waitress was very nice and extremly knowlegdable about the menu. She knew how all the items on the menu were prepaired so we knew what to expect also. Being more of a pickey eater I decided to stay on the safe side and ordered the frittes, strip steak and shrimp. My sister being much more adventurious then I am ordered the Pigs face and Chickpea fritters. We also ordered the chocolate bread. When the chocolate bread came out I was pleasently surprised. It wasn't sweet and just had a small taste of coco. It was graet that the flavor wasn't at all over powering. The shrimp were also very fresh and the sauce was very tasty. The chickpea fritters were well topped with goat cheese and also had a great taste. I was a bit disappointed however with the skirt steak. While I really enjoyed the taste and the veggtables I thought the portion of steak was really small though. The pigs face was amazing however; it had just enough crunch and was very well seasoned. Over all I really enjoyed our meal here. I thought the atmosphere was very nice and the service was exceptional. However I felt the prices were a bit on the high side for the portion sizes. My other warning is to avoid this resturant if you are a picky eater as the menu is a bit on the small side and doesn't offer any of the old stand by dishes. All in all a great pleace if you want to try something different and break out of the norm."
"Yes, yes, yes. This place lives up to the hype and then some. My girlfriend and I ordered 5 dishes, and all lived up to expectations. The cauliflower? Holy cow, what a revelation. No longer the redheaded step-child of the veggie plate at the party, roasted with mint and pine nuts it absolutely holds its own as a dish. The sugo? YUM YUM YUM. Combining the succulent duck and beef with goose berries to give it extra zest makes flavors I never even knew existed pop onto my tongue. (This is a good thing). We also had the clams, ham frites and the squash rangoon. Nothing was bad. And the service provided by our waiter, Patrick, was absolutely excellent. Dude even bent over to adjust our table because it was wobbly. Great job in making us feel welcome."
"Wow, all the hype and high expectations around GATG and it delivered. The dining experience at GATG is fantastic. The wait staff had great attention to detail, you will never find a water glass even half empty nor will you return to your chair to an unfolded napkin. Stephanie's creations are unique and awesomely deliciously. I never knew that beef tongue and strawberries would leave me wanting more. Try the Sugo entree, chick pea fritter and any dessert on the menu."
"I just ate at the Girl and the Goat with my family and it was GREAT - 4.5 stars! Â Overall, the food is heavier and they do season with salt very liberally but it leads to amazing results. Â I'd really love to come back in the late fall when this heavier food will be even tastier :) Â Since we ordered a lot, and tried to be adventurous, here's the run down of what's not to be missed and what could wait for your second visit.EAT THIS FOR SURE:fried squash blossoms filled with mascarpone cheese and crab meat which is served with a yogurt and chive dipping sauce (We ended up ordering 2 of these because they were such a hit)roasted cauliflower . pickled peppers . pine nuts . mint (My vegetarian friend recommended this as did the waitress - don't ask why my veg friend came here with her equally veg boyfriend. Â You can't ONLY eat meat, and you won't be disappointed with this option) seared scallops with shredded goat, cucumber, and onion salad with spiced cantaloupe (WOW)wood oven roasted pig face . sunny side egg . tamarind . cilantro . potato stix (If you're coming to the GATG you really should try something weird. Â This was described as ""breakfasty"" and it was. Â It has a sort of sausagy taste about it with sweet maple syrup)braised beef tongue . masa . beef vinaigrette . salsa verde (Super tasty)THOROUGHLY ENJOYABLE: corney bread - with goat butter and corn relish (Order a bread. Â I know it seems like a waste but it's REALLY good bread. Â The goat butter has a hint of that distinct goat cheese flavor but not nearly as intense)goat chorizo flat bread with green tomatoes and pickled onion (This one was a bit split between the group. Â Some loved it others would rather have spent their calories on ordering double on some of the things from up above.)WAIT TO ORDER: Â kohlrabi salad . fennel . evalon . toasted almonds . blueberry . ginger dressing (Ehhh - It's a salad) wood fired walter's chicken . yuzu harissa . fried pickles . shaved brussels . grilled naan (This one was pretty standard chicken. Â Your friend who refuses to try anything fun on the menu and you're wondering why they even agreed to come to dinner here will order this and be happy) oysters with bacon and horseradish (I'm not an oyster aficionado. Â Tasted good but I bet if you're ordering these it's because you really love oysters and will probably compare them to something amazing you had on the East Coast)goat heart with tomatoes and dates (We ordered a bunch of weird things that ended up surprising us with how amazing they really are but this one failed to impress. Â Tastes a little gaming which does nothing to help you forget what you're eating)"
"I love the ambiance. Â Very lively and happening. Â We actually just went to the bar and ate there. Â The bartenders were very nice. Â Between the two of us, we shared many plates just so that we can try the different items on the menu. Â By the time we were done we were so stuffed. Â The food was good but nothing so amazing that I would jump through hoops for. Â The emphasis is ""so"". Â If I were in the neighbor and wanted food and drinks I would definitely stop by but not make a reservations 2 months in advance."
"This is a great little gastro-pub. Â Wonderful beer selection, great food and service with personality."
"My wife and I went for our anniversary and absolutely loved it. Â We had a pretty late reservation and arrived a little early, but they set us up in the lounge and got us drinks and an appetizer menu. Â We had the whipped fat back with caramelized onions on biscuits, which was an amazing flavor combination, gooey, crackly and delicious. Â We got seated just a few minutes after our reservation and delved into the menu. Â The chickpea fritters with heirloom tomatoes were out of this world, just a great flavor combination. Â The Pig face, which is sort of a headcheese with fried egg was also delicious (again gooey and crackly!) and the prawn dish with the pork ragout was very tasty too. Â The only thing we did not love was the escargot and fried goat balls, but that may be more of a personal taste thing. Â Also, we had the nougat for dessert, which was very tasty, but very very rich. Â The two of us could not eat more than a couple spoonfuls.The wait staff was very helpful and very pleasant. Â My wife is pregnant and not only did they whip her up an excellent ""mocktail"" but also were very knowledgeable about certain dishes on the menu that she may want to avoid. Â The food arrived at our table hot and delicious. Â It seems that everyone agrees with my assessment, as the place was still packed when we left at 10:45 p.m. on a Thursday. Â I suggest getting reservations well in advance!"
"After reading reviews and watching Top Chef I tried the Girl and the Goat tonight. Â All the reviews were spot on! Â The building it is located in is great! Â All the staff I dealt with were great! Â I read about a person on yelp who had Meadows as a waiter and I had him as well and he was great! Â He was a very interactive waiter. Â The Girl and the Goat is very trendy but all the servers can wear jeans and funky shoes. Â This is what our waiter said. Â I think that is a very cool concept and I think it would be cool to work at the girl and the goat. Â  Â  I went with two other people and we share several dishes. Â My favorite dishes were the green beans, Goat Pizza, and beef tongue! Â I never eat green beans and I loved these! Â We also had 2 desserts to split. Â We had the fudgesicle and the goat cheese and blueberry dessert. Â I loved the olive oil ice cream with the chocolate! Â Very different but great combination! Â I will be back soon to try her other dishes!"
"We went to Girl & the Goat for the second time last Friday and, not surprisingly, I was once again impressed! Â This place remains our favorite restaurant in Chicago. Â  Every single bite was unique and amazing. Â The oysters are the best I've ever had and the clam with rock shrimp is highly recommended. Â The wait staff knows every dish and both times we've been our waitress has totally made the night with her recommendations. Â Every part of the night was great. Â If I had find a critique it would be that our wait was a little long past our reservation time, but the kitchen sent out an extra appetizer which I would gladly wait for again. Â Easily a 5 star place, I would assign more stars if I could."
"It's a rare occasion when you dine at a restaurant and can claim that everything you ate was very good, yet that was my experience at G&G. Don't leave without trying the pork ribs and squash fritters, assuming they're still on the menu. If you're not into rich foods then this may not be the place for you. Service was friendly and prompt, cool ambience and lively crowd. Just be prepared for grill smoke."
"I have to admit the four stars is more for the impeccable service then the food. We were seated at the kitchen counter and could chat with the chefs, was really nice. There were elements of some dishes that were really impressive but also some flaws. The hamachi crudo with fried pork belly was AMAZING. Unlike anything I've tasted sooooo worth it. The seppia (cuttlefish) had a great texture, really interesting but probably wouldn't order again. The green beans were a bit too acidic or vinegary for me though a great portion size. The broccoli cheese bread on the softer side, but good. Lamb sausage stuffed calamari was a bit too much lamb sausage and not enough calamari but the sweetbread crisps that were in it, was delicious. If only there was more sweetbread and less lamb.Curious to try some of the other dishes I've heard great things about (pig's face and beef tongue)."
"Love girl and the goat, I only wish it was easier to get a reservation. Such a fun place to go with a group. Food is delicious."
"4 months later... I still feel the same way about Girl and the Goat.SHRUG: (meaning it was good, but I remain skeptical)- Fried oysters, Egg salad, Caper. Â While it tasted good, the breading was too thick and overwhelmed the delicate oyster.- Roasted Pig Face, Egg, Tamarind, Cilantro, Potato Stix. Â Our waiter made a show of plating the dish for us. Â He separated out the 2 slices of pig, smeared it with the tamarind and cilantro sauces, broke the egg in 2 and placed a half on each pig slice, and spooned the potato sticks on top. Â Ok so the pig cheeks were wrapped in tongue, and the whole thing was roasted in the wood oven. Â The dish sort of mimicked breakfast. Â The tamarind and cilantro did not really add anything to the dish. Â On paper, tamarind and cilantro sounded brilliant, but the real thing was just ok.- Lamb Sausage Stuffed Calamari, Sweet Garlic, Sweetbread Crisp, Currant Saor. Â Again, the overall dish tasted good. Â The squid pretty much only served as casing for the sausage. Â There was a faint squid taste that was good when mixed with the lamb taste. Â Parts of the squid though were chewy. Â I loved the saor, and it was a nice play on the Venetian dish. Â As for the nuggets of sweetbread, it begs the question - 'What are you doing here?' Â I just didn't understand what it brought to the dish.- Roasted Beets, Green Beans, White Anchovy, Avocado CrÃ¨me Fraiche. Â As a whole, there was great flavor balance on this one. Â So again, good but no wow.APPLAUSE:- Miso Hungry Bread, Miso Parmesan Butter, Maple Oil. Â Soft bread with a great parmesan crust. Â The miso butter, I would have to say, was the best thing in the entire meal. Â I wanted to dip everything in it.- Kabocha Squash Ravioli, Mushroom Raisin Ragout, Brussel Leaves, Shroom CrÃ¨me Fraiche. Â This is a very nuanced and complex dish. Â There were layers of flavor working harmoniously together.Why 3 stars? Â Girl and the Goat still have not made me go absolutely WOW. Â Certain dishes looked great in concept, but did not deliver. Â Some ingredients did not seem to add or negate a dish. Â So why is it there? Â Girl and the Goat is playing in a field that is just too crowded with great ones. Â What would make me pick the goat over the rest?"
"I wasn't disappointed by all the high ratings on Yelp!! The food was very flavorful. Definitely recommended. I took off one star because for me, the food tends to be a bit too salty for me and I'm not particularly fascinated by the dessert dish I picked - sesame semifreddo. The first time I tasted a salty vanilla ice cream! And my taste buds were not used to it! But overall, I'd def. recommend this restaurant."
"Incredible - one of THE BEST dining experiences I have ever had in Chicago! Â The mood of the restaurant is bustling but not overwhelming, the staff was incredibly attentive and the pace of our amazing food choices was perfectly timed! Â EVERY dish we had was superb, and we had the most difficult time ranking our favorites. Â Definite MUST HAVES: Pig Face, Goat Chorizo Flatbread, the Green Beans, Goat Belly, Goat Donuts and the Fritters!!! Â Obviously you must drink wine, and their list is pretty impressive. Â You cannot visit Chicago and NOT make a reservation at this place - Kudos to the chef!!"
"PIG FACE!!! I know, I know, not the first to recommend it, but seriously, PIG FACE!! When they said to break the egg and mix it all up, I was so game. And unbelievably delicious. Omgosh, I want to go back right now and get it.Ok, so experience in general-- I was a little worried that since we had 5:00 reservations it'd be dead, but we took what we could the day before. Yup, you read that right. Within a half hour or so the place was bumpin'. The service was amazing- from the drink recommendations (love a gin-based establishment!), hilarious shirts (ride the love goat? ok!), to the food recs, I can't wait for another opportunity to go back there.I swear we ordered half the menu. Got the kohlrabi salad (wow), broccoli (good, but I'd pass on it next time), blueberry bread (the blueberry vinaigrette is something I'd drink with a straw), PIG FACE, bolognese (damn good!), and so many other things I'm drooling while typing.Go, get reservations, tho I hear the wait at the bar is enjoyable. The drinks were certainly yummy. YES!"
"This is really more of a 4.5 review. Service was a touch slow to start out, so I really feel that only validates knocking down half a star, but I am nice so I will round up! :) So Anyways: Like I said, service was a bit slow to start, but once our waitress finally made her way over to us and we ordered, food steadily and quickly made it's way out of the kitchen. Between the four of us we each ordered about three dishes a piece, two of the breads and two desserts. This was far too much food, but we didn't care because we wanted to try as much as we could. Everything was very good to fantastic. Since I can't recall the names of all of the dishes and I don't want to ramble on forever I will give you the highlights. The corny goat bread was oh so good. GET IT! The green beans...I know this sounds boring, but GET THEM, they taste like a delicious steak. Corn fritters, Goat balls, Clams and the Goat flat bread, ALL AMAZING! The whipped fat back....GET IT! It's inventive and different then anything we had ever had. Both of our desserts were great, not overly sweet and a little mild, which was a welcomed break because all of our foods were so rich (in a great, great way). I loved the dumpling dessert... TRY IT! If there was one dish that I would say skip it would be the chilled yellow tomato soup, it wasn't bad, but it was alright. I wish I would have choose something different to try. My advice....do what we did. Just go all out! Why not? You won't be disappointed. We will be back."
The asparagus were to die for!
"As a huge fan of Top Chef, I was psyched with Stephanie Izard won and was even more thrilled when she opened up Girl and the Goat. Â I wasn't thrilled with the length of time between making reservations and actually eating at the restaurant, and decided to wait it out until the hype died down a bit. Â However, while cruising around OpenTable one day, I noticed a reservation for G&TG for THE NEXT DAY at a normal eating time and grabbed it without hesitation.Decor: really well done. Â Super comfortable, well laid out, I like the open kitchen and really like the dark wood throughout.Service: super friendly and the waitress was extremely knowledgeable about individual ingredients in each dishFood: so this is where it gets complicated. Â There were 4 of us and we wanted to take full advantage of the fact that we were actually eating at G&TG so we dived in and ordered 13 items from the menu: 2 breads, 2 items from the special menu, 3 veggie dishes, 2 fish dishes, 2 meat dishes and 2 desserts. Â Yes, you're reading that correctly. Â Yes, it felt gluttonous and hedonistic but we didn't really care.First impressions: I was a little surprised to find out that the dishes were small plates. Â And I mean small plates. Â The veal ravioli dish came out with 3 raviolis.Overall critique: pretty much all of the dishes sounded simple on the menu but when they came out, we realized that they were much more complex than we expected. Â So many different flavors and so many different things going on in each bite. Â Reactions: my husband and his sister generally like bold flavors so they were in heaven. Â My husband's sister really liked the squash ravioli and the sesame semifreddo dessert. Â My husband loved the oysters and the chicken. Â I realized during the meal that I may not like bold flavors as much. Â While everything was extremely flavorful, I think it was too much for my taste buds and after awhile, I started craving something simple and toned down. Â I did enjoy the breads in the beginning (the apple pear oil was amazing) but I had trouble with the rest of the meal.I really wanted to love this restaurant but I think that the food is just not for me. Â My husband completely disagrees with me and said that he would go back in a heartbeat. Â I would personally give this a 2 star because it's not the type of food that I enjoy, and I think my husband would go for a 4 star which is why I compromised on 3 stars.I do think that everybody who's into food and likes Stephanie Izard should try it out at least once to see what she's doing and to support her efforts in the brutally-competitive culinary world. Â My taste buds are certainly not the same as everybody else's taste buds so don't just go on this review alone if you're deciding whether to go or not. Â Many congrats to Stephanie on creating a unique menu - we had an enjoyable evening out and are so glad that we were able to try G&TG!"
"Amazing! Chose the wrong wine, but the most incredible food."
"This is one of my new favorites! Â I've been going since last year and am just now writing a review because time permits! Â I've actually never been seated at a table at this joint. Â It's always super crowded and I never bother making reservations. Â I usually drop in after work on a Friday night and eat in the lounge area beside the bar. Â It is communal seating but that usually doesnt bother me. Â The wine selection is good. Â The cheese selection is great. Â The wait staff are really good about answering any questions. Â The flavors here are crazy! Â I mean in a good way! Â I've had the Goat Cheese Pizza, the roasted cauliflower, sauteed greenbeans, seared scallops, lamb sausage. Â Everything was absolutely awesome! Â I can't give it five stars without having the full table experience but 4 stars for side service ain't bad!"
"We were spending a weekend away in Chicago and were recommended Girl and the Goat as a place that was becoming 'very popular'. Local friend of mine gave the recommendation. We researched the place a little and quickly discovered the celebrity status -- owner was winner of Top Chef. Immediately, we figured it would be tough to get in. We decided to be adventurous and walk-in on a Saturday night. Place was packed, but they said ""No problem, about a 30 minute wait."" We had a beer at the bar and soaked up the atmosphere. We were shown our table after 30 minutes. We didn't realize the menu was 'tapas' style as our waiter described it. We ordered 4 dishes..starting with bread and ended with the 'Pig Face'. Everything was delicious, but we were a bit surprised how small the portions were. The place had a ton of energy and was very loud, so it's not really a place for a quiet romantic dinner. Many of the tables were large groups, so we sensed the restaurant is in a phase of being 'the place to be seen' in Chicago.Overall, it was a nice experience and still had a great meal."
"The food was amazing; the sunfish had layers upon layers of flavors. The A/C blowing down upon me throught out the whole meal was horrible, annoying and would actually make me think twice about a return trip - I was told they have to blast it to keep the rest of the restaurant cool - I loved walking out the place at the end of the meal to warm up. Â They also need to come up with a system to tell the servers when all of the ordered plates have come out - we sat, and sat, and sat after our last plate came out and by then were so bored that we didn't want to order dessert (besides wanting to get outside to warm up), we just wanted our check. Â If the food wasn't so good, I would have given less stars."
"After 3 visits and sampling 20 extraordinary dishes on this menu, almost none of which showed a flaw or weakness, I am ready to declare this as my favorite restaurant!Consistently great service and food. Chicago is a lucky town. Among my favorite dishes:Everything. There isn't a dish that isn't worth trying at the price that it's offered."
"This place is absolutely phenomenal! My girlfriend and I went there for a friend's birthday and had a terrific time. There was 8 of us total in our party and the meal went very smoothly. The bus boys cleaned off our table between each serving, replaced our silverware, filled our waters and were very respectful and polite. Our server was extremely personable and knowledgeable about the menu and made great recommendations. We went with the sampling menu and every item we ordered was a home run. Just delicious. You can view the front line in the kitchen as they work and they are efficient and clean. No sitting around waiting for our food and no yelling at each which is great to see when you're patron. The valet cost was reasonable ($10). Our bartender as we waited to be seated was pretty cool and funny. But the other bartenders could be a little more personable as they just ignored us when we sat at the bar. Otherwise, amazing place to eat out. Definitely coming back. You should too!"
We loved it! We did not have a reservation but we sat at the bar and got GREAT service. We were in and out in 1:20 and made it to our show in plenty of time. Parking sucks around here and valet is pricey but the sweet potato gratin was DELISH.
"This is in my 'hood and I've wanted to go since forever so when hubby said how about dinner and it was 4 pm I said ""Quick! Â Lets go to G&G and try to get a table!"" Â And we did. Â I liked the room. Â It made me want to burn want of my walls. Â I did not like that I came home smelling like a smoke pit but worse things have happened. Â Our waiter was very helpful suggesting his favorite and not so favorite dishes and offering to help with the wine. Â I appreciated the help but we didn't take much of his advice. Â And now the food - cuz that's why I came. Â Shishito peppers - I loved the flavor of these. Â They would be a great dish to share since there are a ton of them and after awhile my palette wanted more variety. Â Luckily we also had some green beans, hiramasa, ham frites and pappardelle to round it out. Â Green beans were amazing - I'd come back for those alone. Â Hiramasa - ok. Â Fish was good but the pork belly was overwhelming. Â Making me underwhelmed. Â Ham Frites - the waiter warned us that the flavor could get old and they were just fries but they had me at fries and I was not disappointed. Â I could not stop eating these crunchy salty flavor blasts. Â When I come back for the green beans I'm getting these too. Â Pappardelle - ok but I would try something else...maybe something that smart waiter was talking about. Â Oh! Â There was also bread - beautiful fresh baked, made in house bread. Â We tried the Rye and the chicken noodle - both worth the calories, including those special butters.And then dessert. Â I'm pretty sure we had two but by now the wine had gone to my head and I only dream about, er, remember pork fat donuts and the addictive sesame semifreddo. Â Huband liked it, its walking distance, I'm going back. Â But I think next time I'll take some friends and share some snacks and drinks. Â Who's in?!"
"We've been to Girl & the Goat about four times in the past six months or so, and three of those times have been fantastic. The other time, eh, let's just say if you don't want to sit next to a group of drunk 25-year-olds shrieking over YouTube videos on their iPhones, don't go on a Saturday night.Even though it takes weeks to get a reservation, it's totally worth it; there's just something about parting the crowd of people waiting to be whisked to your table--which has always been waiting for us right on time--to start your experience off well. Atmosphere is good, although I think it's better during the week--fewer trend-seekers, more people in jeans. They usually play good music, and I appreciate that.Food. The breads are totally worth the couple of bucks and for the most part are just enough to munch on without being more than you want; we had the rye bread + thousand island and mustard spreads last time, and it was a bit much for two people. Of the rotating items that we've tried, the goat empanadas are killer; the goat carpaccio is fine, but somehow less exciting than I want it to be; and the oysters have always been well-flavored if not revelatory. This is a good place to go for the carnivorous gusto. The pig face + egg is, you know, fatty awesomeness topped with crispy salty bits. I am in love with the roasted baby octopus and the escargot ravioli, but we found Â the lamb sausage-stuffed calamari to be a total fail. I always plan to not get the ham frites, but then we do because they are perfect fries, and they have tasty tasty sauces. We've had the hanger steak and it was perfectly cooked and delightfully chewy, but it's not a reinvention of the concept or anything. Two plates per person + bread + (optional oysters) + cheese or dessert is more than enough, I think. Speaking of the cheese, the cheese menu--which was a by-request-only thing for a while--is now back in a more limited form on the dessert menu. If you're a fan of the cheeses, it's probably worth asking if they have more. We've had a number of good raw milk cheeses of many varieties, and they always come with solid accompaniments and appropriate crackers. I'm less into the desserts, which seem almost gimmicky at times. When I asked what the shitaake gelato tasted like, for example, the server very honestly told me it didn't taste a thing like mushrooms, which raises the questions, then why?Service is generally on it and friendly, so I think the difference between a really good Girl & the Goat server and an average one is ability to manage the pacing of your courses. On our slightly more ill-fated visit, we got bombarded with so much food it wouldn't fit on our table. Our best times have given us one dish at a time, which leaves plenty of time to actually enjoy each bite. Pacing can make or break your dinner here, I think, so if you're a slow eater it may be worth ordering as you go instead of all at once."
"I think the staff alone deserves a separate 5 star review. Every time I've been there, every single host, server, manager and busser has been phenomenal. Polite, friendly and very responsive, they put the finishing touch on the phenomenal food. I've walked in with reservations and without, and once had to wait 2.5 hours. Waiting 2.5 hrs for a table can be a bit of a drag, but the server made sure we were comfortable and had drinks and appetizers while we waited. She even comped us an appetizer when our wait extended over the 2 hour estimate we were initially given. The server at our table was articulate and detailed and told us which items could be altered to suit our dietary needs. Girl and the Goat is my go-to place for a good meal here in Chicago."
"I have been to G&G a few times and really like this place. It's not Â a restaurant you need to go frequently but the food is unbelievable. Last night, the desert blew us away. It combined dark chocolate, peanut butter, marshmallow and chili peppers. Â The only aspect which wasn't up to parkas the service."
"Loved the roasted cauliflower dish! The mint flavor in the dish was unexpected, but delicious. Overall, the food was good; however, we felt Â rushed through dinner. After making reservations a month in advance, it would have been nice to be able to relax and take our time to enjoy the meal without having a server ask if we were finished every few minutes. Glad I got to experience the food, but won't be rushing back any time soon."
"I don't want to be redundant, so I'll just say it is indeed 5 stars in my opinion AKA ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"""
"I back the 4.5 stars for G&G. It was a great experience from the bar to dinner to the lounge area. The bartender was gracious enuf to let us switch our drinks coz we didn't like what we ordered, the hostess got us seating at the lounge after dinner and the waitress took the time to explain things on the menu and everything she recommended was amazing! We made reservations early on a Thurs evening and ended up staying there till about 10pm. It gets really crowded after 6 or so. Will go back there again to try the rest of the menu. Definitely get the chocolate dessert on the menu...you wont regret it."
"After all the hype, I was expecting my hair to be blown back. Â Don't get me wrong, the meal/drinks/service was good...but by no means great. Â Our server walked away from the table twice while we were talking to her (I have no idea why) and she spoke so softly we had to keep asking her to speak up. Â The food was good, but not great. Â The best dish was certainly the pig face. Â Even the much anticipated cake with shiitake gelato was dry and meh. Â All in all, I would rather spend my money at Gilt Bar or Mercat for a great meal."
"Deliciousss dining experience! Â And what a cute logo Â :)Make reservations now!! Â It was a two-week wait for us for a Monday night, and I think it's close to a 3-4 week wait for prime times on the weekends! Â Unless of course you are not opposed to eating way early or way late...Hands down best dish: PIG FACE. Â Sounds actually kind of gross, but it looks nothing like a pig face and it's unbelievably mouth wateringly delicious! Â I'm so glad other yelp reviews pointed to this otherwise I really don't think we would've ordered this dish!Other highlights: Â scallop dish, bread w/chimichurri and lemon butter. Â The server said the green beans was a highlight - well...it was good, but I don't think that is a ""must have"" personally. Â I was really excited for the short ribs because that's usually always a winner with me - but it definitely wasn't a highlight for me this night.Stephanie Izard was so nice to take a few minutes out of her busy night to take a picture with us as well! Â Love it Â :) Â I am going back for pig face...I am drooling just thinking about it.Another tip - go with friends so you can share and sample more dishes."
"If you 1) love food, and 2) aren't pretentious, go here.I'm typically apprehensive about hyped-up splurge-y restaurants but the parents were in town to celebrate my birthday and I've gotten to that age where I consider food to be a great birthday present. There's this characteristic about dining out where the most satisfying meals can be found in a very respectable price range and anything exceeding that price range is only marginally more satisfying, if at all. If I'm going to entertain hype and spring for a pricier-than-average meal, I expect genuinely good service and a comfortable environment in addition to lots of great quality food. In all regards the Girl and the Goat did not disappoint.The level of service was exceptional. We showed up 30 minutes before our reservation with the intent of grabbing drinks before we sat down, and instead the hostess said that she could seat us right then and there if we wanted to drink at our table. Granted it was still before 6pm on a Monday night but the place was definitely busy. After we were seated our waiter showed up and made a move that had us sold before we even tasted the food. My Mom has always had a garlic allergy and we've gotten really used to stressing out every waiter we meet. However on this occasion we were greeted with 4 menus, 3 of which were standard and 1 of which was completely annotated with instructions for every (yes, every) item on the menu and if/how it could be prepared without garlic. I'm pretty sure my Mom felt as if the make-a-wish foundation couldn't have done better were she a 5-year old with cancer.Now I don't want to surprise anybody or anything, but the food was great. We had a couple dishes from each category (Veggie/Fish/Meat) and we loved all of them through and through. The piping-hot bread with dipping sauces even hit the spot. The table favorite was the Sweet Potato Gratin, hands down. For a meal of small plates shared amongst 4 people, I was happy to have been more than full by the time everything was said and done.I won't say I had the most satisfying meal of my life at Girl and the Goat, but given the entire experience I will say it was easily one of the most memorable."
"What a wonderful restaurant. I still have a ""buzz"" from the good food and the good feeling, even 2 days later. I live with one foot in Washington D.C. and one in NYC, and I really enjoy unfussy, casual, but GOOD food. I found it in Chicago. The chickpea fritters and hummus were amazing. I also had skate with a fried egg on top, and it was extraordinary. Great local draft beer as well. So happy...."
Went their by myself on a Monday night hoping to find a seat at the bar and had to wait 30 minutes. Â The place was packed. Â Tried the crudo and scallop at the bartender's recommendation and both were fabulous. Â Would definitely go again if I'm back in Chicago.
"With almost 500 reviews of Girl and the Goat already posted, there isn't much more to say. Â I write only to add my ""yes, it really is that good!"" to the mix. Â I was somewhat skeptical that Girl could live up to the hype, but it certainly does. Â Don't let the crowds scare you off: Â once we were seated, we somehow didn't feel rushed or crowded. Â The food is, of course, outstanding, but I think what really makes the place is the staff. Â Everyone from the hostess to the bus boys were friendly but professional. Â It was an excellent evening, and I look forward to my next visit."
"This place is worth the wait!We opted to go a very late dinner rather than make a reservation 2-3 months out in advance. Â We lucked out and didn't wait too terribly long, althought it was a 10PM dinner on a week night.Got a table facing the kitchen, that was fun! Â Great ambiance in the restaurant, very large lounge/cocktail area.My favs from the night:Chickpea Fritters - so tasty, light and airy! Â I think my favorite dish of the night.Bread with goat cheese butter and corn relish - the butter is so flavorful!Can't wait to go back!"
"Not as good as it should be, If you like to much butter, grease, and salt this is the place for you. There is a few high lights, the bread, and the decor is beautiful. But you don't go to a place like this for bread, and you can keep the decor. just Â  make the food stand on it's own and don't cover with everything mentioned above. No doubt Stephanie has made a name for herself in the restaurant world, and I believe with time she will be one of the greats . But for now there is room for improvement ."
"Just....wow. It lived up to the hype, and way more. We ordered about 10 dishes for a group of 5. Every single dish, except the beet salad which just was just ok, was absolutely amazing. Green beans, chickpeas, goat....all mouth watering. Really anything on the menu will be fantastic and unique, including the deserts. Reservations are a bear to get, but they were able to make accommodations for our group celebrating a graduation for a 10:30 reservation about a month ahead of time. Service was also fantastic. I can't say enough. Just amazing."
Disappointing. Most dishes way too salty. Reception not friendly. But still had good time. Â The shishito chillies were amazing though.
"if you are dining with a large enough group (or just really hungry) the full size goat leg is a MUST TRY. 6 pounds of meat (bone-in of course) served on a wooden chopping board with 6 different kinds of sauces and some pita bread to enjoy it with. amazing.we were a group of 8 and ordered around 7-8 plates before the goat leg arrived, so needless to say, there was much left over. ended up taking about 4 pounds of the goat home - but no worries, we had a second round the night after making goat and cole slaw paninis!the ambiance has a good vibe here. the open kitchen running along almost an entire wall was a nice touch - got to see all the food coming out. great decor, lively crowd, definitely lives up to the hype."
"This is my new favorite restaurant in Chicago! I had tried to get reservations for a saturday night about a month after the restaurant had just opened, but realized they were all booked for the next months ahead. So my boyfriend and I decided to just show up and see if there were any open seats in the lounge or at the bar. To our luck, two seats opened up at the bar, just ten minutes after we had arrived! We were able to order everything off the menu. We had the roasted cauliflower, scallops, hiramasa crudo, goat/pork/veal sugo, and the pigface. There was not one dish that we didn't think was excellent. I would order all of them and MORE at my next visit. It was nice to see Stephanie working the line the entire night, inspecting the dishes as they went out. This was such a fun dining experience. We tried to come in with low expectations but were completely wowed by the food."
"Ask for Amy at the bar, great recommendations on the most daring menu around!"
"I have to admit this place lived up to the hype. Â Multiple friends have said that they loved the place but I still had a hard time believing that this place would justify long waits and impossible to get reservations. Â Dishes are meant to be shared but some are on the small side. Â Dishes were very creative, even ones with simple ingredients. Â Staff was super friendly and helpful. Â The only reason that I did not give this place 5 stars is that the prices are a bit high for the portions they give (especially the meat/seafood dishes)."
"Loved Girl and Goat. Â Although a bit noisy, the music was great (think phoenix & radiohead), and the ambience was fun. Â We started with the loompa bread & the wood fired wiley points, then moved onto the shaved kohlrabi, grilled baby octopus, braised beef tongue, fried pig face, and escargot with goat balls. Â Highlights were the fried pig face and braised beef tongue. I think we were a little overzealous with our ordering, 4-5 of the small plates would have been plenty. It was pretty busy even at 10 (when we had our reservation), so reserves are a must. Â Would definitely go back to try more!"
"Got Friday 11:30 pm reservations two days before dining at GATG. Â We (party of 3) arrived at 11 pm and were seated right away even though we were prepared to spend time at the bar.I can't recall everything we ordered but we ordered based on our waitress' recommendations. Â Among the items we ordered were: lamb sausage stuffed calamari, roasted cauliflower, skirt steak, green beans, one of their breads, etc.Can't say the place lives up to all the hype. Â All three of us agreed service was good, nice place to people watch, and food was tasty although a bit salty. Â I was pleasantly surprised the bill came out to only ~$45/person even though we did have a few cocktails."
"dunno if its all the hype, the reservation process was a breeze and was able to get a weekend reservation with less than a weeks notice at a reasonable time - 530pm.our waitress was super knowledgable and super enthusiastic about the menu selection. Â i suppose thats what you want in a new restaurant that has the hype that this one seems to project. it works. we challenged our taste buds to the following menu items.liver butter breadoyster with egg saladoyster with aioliscallops and vealgoat pizzabeef tonguefood was excellent-price was meh! i wish the portions were larger for the price because it does leave you wanting for more. i'll try again in two months, maybe the menu will change as i hear its suppose to be seaonal, otherwise theres still a lot more to try on the initial menu-but at what cost???"
"4.5 StarsVisited this fine establishment with a girlfriend from out-of-town for post theater nosh. We had late mid-week reservations, and the girl (and her goat) were still happily bustling.Favorites: Shishito peppers (my favorite things of the evening. Â Inexplicably good. Â Charred and smoky-sweet. Â I've has dreams about them). Â  The bread. Â Don't skip the bread. Cauliflower - tangy and nutty. Chickpea fritters - light.Good: Sugo, Chicken with little fried pickle chips (and I don't really like pickles)Meh: Â Scallops - over-seasoned and slightly over-cookedWill be back next month with my meat-loving husband and will post a secondary review."
Well I have to say that I hate writing a bad review but I honestly can say I can do that :). The vibe is really good in the Girl and the Goat the music selection is very nice. The down fall it takes about 3 months to get on the waiting list that could be and is annoying. Once you get in the though you will realize the food is decently priced but the mix drinks are expensive but not the best ones in the world. Mixologies provide better drinks at decent prices. The food is good try the Green Beans and the loompa bread which is good. The beef ribs is not the best but I hear the pork ribs are good. The scallopse are not the best but I love the octopus. This is a place that you should try at least once. I will be going again maybe in another 3 months but there are a lot of good places to try in Chicago so i am sure I will have more to compare this place to in 3 months :). All in all the vibe is good and I enjoyed the experience.
"Definitely worth eating at 4:45pm. We sat at the chef's table and received several sample dishes in addition what we ordered. Honestly, the pig face was good, but we found so many other dishes to be sublime. We love that even the vegetable dishes are worth a return visit alone. The cauliflower was our favorite of the whole night. The chickpea was a close second. The ribs were the best I have ever had. And the service was fantastic. Surpassed our very high expectations!"
"Well, what hasn't already been said about this insanely popular, trendy place? Â They hand you puppies as you leave! Â No, not really, but the food is really good.Our group of four made reservations about two months ahead of time for 8:30 PM on a Monday night. Â I figured that meant this place was small, but nope, it's huge. Â It's definitely got the trendy, swanky type feel that I typically don't covet - more of a New York style. Â But it doesn't give off a stuffy or pompous vibe, although the clientele certainly dresses to impress. Â It's a huge open space that is constantly full - there was even a seating after us at 10:30 pm on a Monday.The small plates are great to share and to get a good sampling of Chef Izard's creations. Â We had 8 dishes which was a perfect amount for the four of us - felt satisfied, but not stuffed to the brim.Here are the dishes we tried (at least if my memory is correct...it was a while ago):1.) Ham frittes - great way to start it off. Â Perfectly sliced and seasoned french fries in ham fat, drizzled with bits of meat and served with a tomato aioli sauce and another one that I've forgotten. Â Perhaps you'd think french fries can't possibly be worthwhile at a restaurant of this caliber; but I'd disagree with you. Â While maybe not as revolutionary as other dishes, it was a good dish to get our feet wet and also provided a good start to ameliorate our hunger. Â The portion was quite large actually, they were fairly cheap, and they were gone...fast.2.) Chickpeas fritters - almost a fried tofu-like texture, these fritters were delectable. Â The hazelnut hummus provides a nice counterbalance to the punch of other ingredients in the dish.3.) Sauteed green beans - Everybody says to try these out and yes, they are good. Â My favorite dish of the night however? Â No. Â But do I regret ordering it? No.4.) Soft shell crab - I'm not a seafood person, so just had a couple bites of this, but I've gotta say, this dish was perfectly balanced. Â The favorite dish of the more seafood ecstatic people I went with.5.) Hanger steak - probably the most forgettable of the dishes. Â I might skip this next to to try something else a bit more adventurous, but still tasted good.6.) Escargot ravioli - yummy.7.) Lamb tartar - like tartar? Â You'll like this.8.) Goat, Pork, and Veal Sugo - Uh....mouthwatering.We ordered a bottle of wine for the table and somebody got a beer and it came out to about $40/person. Â Not particularly ""cheap"" but definitely reasonable for the quality of dishes you receive. Â You can tell there was a lot of time, care, and attention to detail in creating these menu items. Â It's not necessarily that the ingredients themselves are super revolutionary, but how they are combined in a single dish is ingenious. Â You really have to taste it to believe it. I'd highly recommend checking Girl & the Goat out. Â Just be prepared to make reservations 2 months ahead of time...or get there super early."
"What else can I add? Flawless food - super-flavorful. Goat cheese bavaroise was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Personable chef (who is super-cute), great prices. Cozy atmosphere. Been back multiple times. A+ Stephanie Izard!"
"Disappointing! I was genuinely excited to try this restaurant. I had followed Top Chef and several friends had recommended this place. I arrived on a Thursday night without reservations, but up for the wait. We were quoted a 1.5-2 hour wait which turned into 2.5 hours. The bar area was so crowded that it was extremely difficult to order drinks. When we were finally seated, our waitress was nice and knowledgeable. Unfortunately, I was not impressed by the food. Scallops with cantaloupe and goat- scallops were overdone and I didn't really feel like all the components went well together.Ribs- the sauce was so overpowering and salty, you could not even taste the meat. Ham Frites- way too salty and greasy. These went untouched at our table. Chorizo flat bread- bread was burnt and they placed a creamy sauce that overpowered the dish. Bread with tomato and mushroom butter- okay. Overall, the wait staff was friendly, the place cool, but the food will not bring me back. I agree with others that there are so many wonderful places in Chicago and you shouldn't waste your time or money on this place."
"Great dinner. Â I love that it has a pretty casual atmosphere. Â My lady friend and I got 6 dishes, 5 beers + bread and spend under $150 w/ tip, I think that is pretty reasonable.Some standouts were the green beans (it was the sauce that I wanted to bathe in), pig face, and pork loin. Â I wasn't a big fan of the raviolli, it was just OK. Â All in all 4.5 stars, but sense the service was also great we will bump them to 5"
"I had been salivating for weeks in anticipation for our visit and it was an experience that lived up to expectations. Go!SOUND: very loud and hard to hear those at your table. SIGHT: High open ceilings. Hard wood tables and support beams fill in the big open airy almost lodge-like space. Kind-of open kitchen keep the energy flowing.FEEL: hip yet approachable, casual and a little sexy. Great for a date, but also great for my mom's 60th birthday.FOOD: half the dishes were very memorable and they were all tasty. The flavor and ingredient combinations offered something innovative and new. SERVICE: very well done. Water glasses where never empty and our server really made a difference in making it a special night. EXPENSE: About $170 for food, 1 drink, tip and tax for 3 people who left very full."
"Was lucky enough to get a table for 2 on a Tuesday evening after calling them almost all day lol. Restaurant was crowded but loved the setting...great for a larger group perhaps since you can order a bunch of small dishes to try. Our server was awesome.The food:Chickpea fritters- Was good but not something I'd crave.Skirt steak a la planca- this was ok. didn't blow me awayWood oven roasted pig face- Â Anything taste good with egg on top :)Oysters with egg salad- this was my favorite...realllyyy goooodMussels with lamb sausage crouton- Mussels were small in size. Sauce tasted great tho.If I had to say something was missing, it was being satisfied with the desert menu.Price wasn't bad for 2 people. With a bottle of wine and tip, bill was north of $150."
"I wanted to love this place. Honestly, I don't think I've ever been so excited to go to a restaurant in my life. Â We had reservations and everyone but one person in my party showed up on time. Â One person had run into an emergency and was going to be 10 minutes late. I let the hostess know that she would be late, but that we could be seated and would even begin ordering food. She said it wasn't a problem and we could wait for our last guest.Our last guest showed up 10 minutes after our reservation, I let the hostess know and she said our table was just getting dessert so it wouldn't be too long. Â We grabbed a drink and some of us sat on the couch in the front. Â A minute later a group (same size as ours) sat on the couch and told the server they didn't have reservations so they would just order and eat there. I thought that was amazing! That you can actually walk in and if there's a seat in front you can eat there? Â I would definitely be open to doing that. Â Within 10 minutes, the hostess comes over, tells the group next to us that if they would like, it just so happens that a table opened up for them....Now, I've worked in the restaurant industry, I totally understand if you know someone you get special perks (which it was never stated that they knew anyone), but to say it so loudly in front of our group when we've now been waiting for 40 minutes...I was annoyed. Â So we sit there another 15 minutes.We finally are seated. Â Our server was awesome, came over and recommended everything we would need. Â When the first dish came out, he came over and told us how funny it was - because we had to wait so long for our table, he had ordered that dish for us on the house. Â All was forgotten.Dinner was amazing. The food is superb and doesn't come out too fast, all of the recommendations were right on target with what we wanted. When the bill came, we ended up paying for the dish that was supposed to be on the house...plus the bread that had come to our table when it was supposed to go to the table next to us. We had sent it back since we knew we didn't order it and that point, we really didn't want to argue over $4.Oh Girl and the Goat. I wanted to love you. Â I'm sure someday I'll be back...I'm sure I just came on an off night??"
"great food, server was a bit busy, full of people, acoustically quite loud"
"Two words: chickpea fritters. That's all you need to know. Awesome space, great atmosphere, zero pretention for one of Chitown's hot spots, and superb menu. If you're in the windy city it's a must experience."
"Amazing food and amazing service! Â Went here last night with a group of friends and loved it. Â Our waitress was great in recommending dishes... we got to try a spread of about 9 plates. Â I loved the beet bread, scallops, crispy pig face and green beans. Â She pays as much attention to her vegetables as she does her other dishes! Â Only mild complaint was that our food tasted a bit salty overall. Â Otherwise, I would definitely recommend this place to others!"
"AMAZING food! I went with a friend who was able to get last minute reservations. Our server was very helpful with answering all of our questions. We got ceviche, beet salad, cauliflower salad, potato bread, pork shank. And I got their drink Best of 3 AMAZING!!!! The price of this place is so worth it, the food is amazing, the service is amazing. Everything is amazing"
"As good as advertised. Â Food is creative, unique and fun. Â Service was above average. Â Made us wait 15 minutes past reservation time, but the place is mobbed. Â Loved the pig face and mushroom Gelato. Â will be back!"
"Girl and the Goat was good, but not worth the over three month wait. Â My friends and I made a reservation in April and we just went.I will say that the way G & G organizes your food to come out is unique and was my favorite part of eating there.The restaurant itself was very smoky. There are so many gems in Chicago that you don't need to wait three months to get into.I would recommend Girl and the Goat but I am not in a rush to return"
"Place was absolutely amazing. The food was incredible and I am not a very adventurous eater, luckily my girlfriend is and she ordered and made me eat everything and I loved it. The best thing we had was probably the lamb tartar. The service was awesome.....the best restaurant experience I have ever had"
"Loud and fun and delicious. A truly superlative meal. We were seated at one of two chef's tables, and had a great time watching food prep and talking with the line cooks. Chickpea fritters, sauteed shirmp, and pig face were all particularly amazing. The flavors in the shrimp may give an idea of the artistry involved in these combinations: harissa, tamarind, pork, peanuts, shiitake, and squash. This meal would be incredible at almost twice the price -- get there now!"
Atmosphere here was great! I loved the rustic feel and ambiance. I went on a Tuesday night and the place was still packed at 11! The Fox Glove wine is a stellar pick for the vino drinkers. Veronica our waitress was a true delight that made the experience. We sat in the lounge area which was much more intimate and the decor was hip.
"Awesome experience! Came last saturday and it was worth the ungodly 5PM reservation. From chickpea fritters, to the roasted peppers rolled in miso tahini sauce, to the ham frites, skirt steak, roasted pig face with fried egg, and oh yes, the fresh sourdough bread with sweet onion butter, I thought I'd died and gone to food heaven. We loved everything."
"Love the atmosphere and staffs. We got the seats next to the kitchen. It was warm and kind off private. The food was great. Lamb sausage stuffed calamari was our favorite. Tortone bread with sweet onion butter was as good as everyone said.The bread also came with chimichurri sauce, which was good too. We tried the frog legs. They were good but tasted too fatty for our preferences, and there was a tiny bone in every single piece too. Green beans were cooked perfectly and served with some kind of vinegratte and cashews. They tasted great and rich (almost too rich). It is great to share among group of people. This was too much to share for two. Pepperdelle was tasty. The meat served with is a combination of veal, goat and pork. My bf said he prefers each kind of meat separately. I did not mind the mix but liked one kind over the other. I could not tell what it was. For dessert, we had the bittersweet cake with shitake gelato. Cake was too sweet, not much bittersweet. It was good though. I wish that the gelato was bigger. El Jardin cocktail looked kinda sad but it tasted good."
"Excellent. Â I was afraid that this could turn out to be another stuffy, high end, trendy, and/or over the top place... but it was the complete opposite. Â Low key yet classy and a bit quirky but fun, and most importantly, delicious and affordable. Â I highly recommend the green beans (yes, just beans but out of this world), octopus (not something I normally pick but yummy), ribs (so savory), flatbread (my favorite of all!), and for dessert, goat cheese bavarois (sounds funky but I sampled all 4 different desserts - this was by far the best to me!). Â The bad part? Â Reservations are insane. Â Leave work early, go on a weekday, etc. - it will be worth it!!!!"
"Not like this restaurant needs another rave review, but here one comes! Â My fiance was dying to eat here, and so I made reservations (2 months in advance) for his birthday. Â I highly recommend requesting the chef's table! Â We literally sat directly in front of the cooks. Â They explained so much and it was so entertaining to see things being prepared right in front of us! Â (We even got a mini sample of things I'd be too timid to order, like baby octopus!) Â Definitely order something off the breads menu. Â Don't be scared to try pig face, it tastes much better than it sounds. Â Great ambience, great food, only down side is how long it takes to get a reservation."
"God, I love Top Chefs. Â What a talent to make cauliflower one of the best things I've ever tried. Â Well done. Â SOOOO good and so creative! I will note that this is going up there in my top list of restaurants."
"I've stayed away from here since they've opened simply because of the hype and we just don't ever wait like tourists sometimes do to get into a restaurant. Â But Monday evening at 7pm, I was by myself in the neighborhood walking by on my way for fried chicken at Porkchop, saw there was space at the bar. came in and sat down. Â Expert and friendly bartender service, and nice upscale but not a snooty vibe, had the cauliflower (loved the pickled peppers), a mushroom ravioli, and then a goat chorizo flat bread (too much slaw texture, not enough goat sausage, but tasty). Everything was expertly handmade, down to the smallest ingredient. Â  Not an extensive draft beer selection, but I was happy enough with my 3 Floyds/Robert the Bruce. Â I was persuaded into getting the chocolate bouchon dessert, which turned out to be my highlight dish of the meal. At first I thought it was a simple brownie and ice cream dessert, but after a solid spoonful hidden chunk of perfect salted dark chocolate toffee chunks at the bottom, with a gooseberry/fig-like compote and chocolate sorbet that started to melt...I will return with company for this dish alone, try and share many others, and never after 8pm, since that's when the line was almost out the door. Â Funny thing, when I returned home, my wife said my clothes reeked of meat. Â A small price to pay for an excellent meal."
"Somehow I was able to score a 6:30 reservation within 3 days... That was the start of a wonderful evening. Â I was eager to try some of the dishes I had read about but was a bit apprehensive because my boyfriend is not much for food outside of his comfort zone (pizza, chinese, Portillo's). Â I prayed that there would be some steak on the menu and came prepared with some ideas for his order. Â To say that he is not a ""foodie"" is quite an understatement. Â However, he is a good sport and knew how excited I was to try this restaurant so he was willing to go along!We were actually seated early and got a great seat along the side wall. Â This is a very loud restaurant so if you are seated away from the middle, you might be able to have a conversation (though, quite frankly, the food is so spectacular, no conversation is necessary). Â Our waiter was very attentive and helpful, giving advice on the balance of our menu choices. Â We ordered the green beans first, which were magically delicious. Â I wanted to lick the plate but remembered that, as an adult, it was unacceptable behavior. Â Besides the fish sauce, there are cashews to add texture to this amazing dish. Â Next we had scallops... I didn't eat these (boyfriend loved them) but I did enjoy the accompanying accroutements: trumpet mushrooms and something else. Wonderful! The last two dishes were steak and e goat/veal/pork sugo. Also amazing. Â The sugo reminded me of a dish I'd ordered in Florence with wild boar. Â The flavors and textures of this dish were exquisite! Â Finally, we ordered the rhubarb/panna cotta/graham cracker trifle item to share from the dessert menu. Â This was an excellent finish to this meal. Â Tangy, crunchy, soft, delicious.All throughout dinner, we were both wowed by the flavor and the choices. Â I have to come back repeatedly to try other items on the menu. I have already secured a reservation for mid-May but may try to walk in sooner since it will be hard to wait so long."
"We didn't have high expectations despite the hype because of the mixed reviews we had heard and read. Happy to report that our apprehension was for naught. Girl and the Goat did not disappoint our party of eight. We were seated promptly, a choice table for 8, right outside the kitchen, where we observed the dedicated chefs meticulously preparing the food and Stephanie Izard closely supervising and facilitating the orders. Our server was attentive and extremely helpful in guiding us with our selections. We savored the original creations including - - hiramasa crudo (hiramasa sashimi topped with aji ajioli, crispy pork belly and caperberries); calamari stuffed with lamb sausage; smoked goat pizza, wood oven roasted pig face (with sunny side egg, tamarind, cilantro and potato sticks); braised beef tongue (with salsa verde and beef vinaigrette), roasted lamb shank (eaten with flatbread, curry aioli, grape escabeche). And we couldn't have ended the evening better with the dessert sampler that included - bourbon apples (with cranberry, almonds, maple fat gelato) bittersweet chocolate topped with shiitake gelato, toffee creme fraiche; sticky date cake (with marshmallow, lemon quince and pepita crunch) and coca nib donuts (with pomegranate ganache, brut sabayon, smoked pear and pine nut brittle). The place is 'above average' noisy. But we didn't care ... we were in food heaven."
"This place was so cool! Why even write a long review? You like food? You like grossing out people who are picky and freak out when you don't say drumstick or medium well steak (yuck! Rare please...)? Eat here. Only dis: bacon fat fries and apple pie rum thing were waaaaay too salty. I see what they were going for, though."
"Amazing, get the pig face. But seriously try it. I have been wanting to try this restaurant and was not disappointed, it lived up to the hype. The menu was creative, the flavors were complimentary to each other, and I left stuffed. Defiantly will be going back."
"fun atmosphere, lots of different and delicious foods"
"My boyfriend and I had been waiting to get into this place for months. Finally I surprised him on his birthday and we were far from disappointed by the food, decor, and service. This small plates restaurant is great for those who want to explore all that the menu has to offer. The honey crisp soup was fantastic. A great way to start off the meal. It had blends of sweetness while still remaining savory. The chickpea fritters was a big hit, though I must say the fritters itself were a bit bland if it weren't for a few of the underlying garnishes.The squash ravioli was excellent. My only complaint was that there was hardly enough in the bowl to truly satisfy. It didn't take long to find ourselves sifting through all of the mushrooms and other vegetables to get to the few remaining ravioli pieces.Seared Scallops- An absolute must!! Some of the best scallops I have ever had. We should've ordered a few more plates.Sauteed green beans- a wee bit salty for my taste. The fish sauce vinaigrette was a bit strong.Grilled octopus- I would've liked more octopus and less of everything else. This dish was also a bit salty for my taste buds.Smoked Goat Pizza- A must have!Skirt steak- Another must have!The desserts were a bit of a hit or miss. While we liked the Shitake mushroom gelato and toffee brownie, the table wasn't so crazed about the apple, cranberry and miso marcota almond crumb dessert. Â It was too sour for our sweet expectations.We look forward to heading back to this place soon! Or at least when reservations are easier to come by!"
"Mad props to Stephanie Izard and the delcious food she accomplishes. Yes there's a lot of hype for the Top Chef winner, but it's totally worth it to make that reservation 3 months in advance. Â I came here with 5 ladies for my birthday and tried about 15 dishes - yeah we couldn't get enough so we ordered a heck of a lot. Â My favorites have to be the baked oyster - the egg salad and caper combo just melts in your mouth. Â The pig face was lucious and juicy. Â The squash blossom rangoon was finger licking good too. Â The only thing I wasn't really impressed with was the fish we ordered because the original order of scallops not being available. Â Oh and the goat belly is OMG!! Â Go enjoy the ambiance, check out Stephanie in action, have a fancy cocktail - I tried the cucumber one & it was perfect. Â I can say with all them people stuffed inside that it was a bit warm for my tast, but it's also an open kitchen & we were at a smaller table for 6 of us...but I can't complain as Chef herself came & said hello. Â I'll be back to check out the newest seasonal menu."
"My wife and I were here on business recently and discovered Girl and the Goat through many local people. We were not able to get a reservation on such short notice; however, we went as a wait customer. Upon arrival we were pleasantly greeted and informed of the possible two hour wait, we were aware of this prior to arrival. After putting our name on the wait list, we were assisted by a young lady giving us the particulars on waiting in the lounge/ bar area. She even assisted in helping us find a place to wait in the lounge, very helpful.After sitting in the lounge enjoying a few drinks, small plates and making some new friends (both from Canada and Chicago) the two hours went quickly.When seated we had some additional wonderful small plates. They even accommodated my gluten allergy and took Â the time to understand my allergy and explain all options open to me.The entire experience was wonderful, the staff, the food and the new friends we meet. This is on restaurant we will not forget and one many others should give a chance, even with the potential.My only regret is that I did not buy a shirt to take back to Philadelphia."
"Excellent, excellent and excellent - never before wrote this about a place in Chicago.If you are on a date, go for table 4 or 5 - best tables in the restaurant."
"Maybe I expected too much but the food was a bit of a let down.I thought the pretzel bread was pretty good. Â And they had a dark stout that quickly became my favorite beer (but then I am not a beer drinker).My favorite was probably the Crudo. Â But nothing that I'd return for. Â My dinner date liked the Sugo but I thought it was just okay.The Roasted Cauliflower which I thought had some real potential (and which the couple next to us were devouring with praise) was over-salted in my opinion and was ruined by it...and I love salt.Maybe I need to try something else on the menu because I didn't get what all the hype was about.I did like the atmosphere of the restaurant. Â I'd probably return to G&G when an out-of-town guest comes to Chicago since it's such a ""hip"" place to go."
"I'm writing this review geared toward Vegetarians specifically. Though there isn't a heaping amount of veggie-friendly food on the current menu, everything I could have was so delicious! It is very rich, so it was filling. Tell your server you are vegetarian, because certain items that would seem safe to eat, are not veggie friendly (example: some of the bread is made with animal fat, some of the desserts are made with bacon fat). Chickpea fritters were crispy outside, soft inside, with crispy AND fresh chickpeas all around the fritters. Hazelnut hummus underneath added just enough of the hazelnut sweet to balance out the saltiness of the fried-ness. I could have licked the bowls. Sweet potato gratin. Oh. My. God. Comfort food, for sure. As I ate it, I dreamed of eating a pot of it at home on my couch as it snowed and slushed outside. The blue cheese added a little kick to it. It's not mashed, but rather slices of sweet potato were cooked perfectly. Honestly I could have done without the mushroom squash ravioli-- something was just too salty about it. Dessert for me was the chocolate cake + mushroom truffle ice cream. There were little bits of crunchy in the cake, and I think it was espresso beans? Maybe cocoa nibs? Couldn't tell. Clearly, I need another piece to tell :)Our service was impeccable. Our server didn't skip a beat. Our plates were constantly changed after each course, and water filled instantly in our glasses. If you have a large party like we did, I suggest trying to sit near the kitchen. It's interesting to watch all the chefs do their thing-- there are so many of them! My only issue with the space is the location of the bathrooms-- they are downstairs, all the way at the front of the building. Â But the bathrooms themselves are very cute."
Seared Scallops!
"This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants if you can get a reservation I highly recommend it. Small tapas portions so you can go and try a bunch of different itemd, rather than be stuck with just one. Â Chef Izard is a genious how she pairs different styles, flavors and textures into each dish. Â If you go, I suggest the cauliflower and the ""pig face"" as 2 must have dishes...so good. The staff is so nice and courious, unlike at some other restaurants in the city that are always packed...just very humble. I love this place and hope to go back numerous times."
"I realize this place pretty much speaks for itself by this point but I just feel like I need to echo all the remarks this place has been getting. Â The reservations are pretty tough to come by but one can definitely find luck walking on and just hanging out in their lounge, comfort aside, it's also one of the most social dinning experiences I've had. Although I had some high expectations of the menu, I was still pretty impressed and on top of the our server Mandy was just phenomenal and truly made the night a really incredible experience."
"LOVE GIRL & THE GOAT! Â I have eaten here twice now and have just had the best experiences! Â I have now tried every item on the menu and love them all. Â I am a huge fan of savory dishes and ""the Goat"" Â is wonderful for that! Â Some of my favorites are the Sepia, as well as the 4 oysters! YUM!!! Make reservations if you can, but if you are willing to wait it is totally worth it!!!Happy Eating!"
"The only thing stopping me from giving it a 5, is the gal ""in the office"" that answers the phone - she gets a 2. Everything and everyone else was fabulous. Â From the ""maitre d""/host to our waiter and the water boy, everyone was great, and the food was amazing. Ambience is fun, with a dark wood, rustic New York tavern feel. Â We had the following items, and they were all delicious.2 bread appetizers: Fall-caccia and I don't recall the other name. Â The bread itself was ""ok"", but the spreads/dips that came w/ were amazing and made the dish(es). Â Next we had: Â pan fried shishito peppers, grilled baby octopus, grilled beef short ribs and one other item that I cannot recall. Â There were three of us, we shared everything and there was plenty of food. The next time I am in Chicago, I will definitely make an effort to get out here again."
"I don't care how long you have to wait to get in or if you have to crawl, skip, or cab it over to the west loop - you have to go to girl and the goat.It is a must to go to this restaurant - I cannot even describe the euphoria that this dining experience caused for our entire dining groupThe ambiance is the perfect mix of cool, chic and fun. Â  Great for groups and for smaller tables too.The service is spot on - the perfect combination between attentive and accommodating. Â But the food, I loved Stephanie on Top Chef, but her and her team are an amazing group of chefs and it really is a group effort which is awesome. Â Everything is amazing and be adventurous - you won't be disappointed or sorry that you were. Â And don't skip on the veg - the cauliflower and green beans are the best!I could go on and on - but it would be better if you picked up the phone and called to make a reservation, you'll need it - but it is so worth the wait and anticipation. Â Enjoy!"
"The food was great except for the fact that it was all WAY TOO SALTY. Â Not enjoyable after a couple of dishes. Â Every single dish tasted like it had been doused in salt before being sent to the table... Â That being said the scallops and baby octopus were pretty damn good despite all the sodium.We had a reservation for 9 on a Friday. Â My gf and I arrived promptly and were told our table was not ready yet. Â No problem, we grabbed a drink and waited. Â 20 minutes later, the hostess said our table was ready and started leading us to our table... but wait there were no empty tables. Â She apologizes and asks us to wait a bit more. Â Finally, we were seated around 9:30 by the bar. Â Unfortunately, a couple of dbags standing practically right over the table were being really loud for the first half of the meal... Â Not the most enjoyable atmosphere. Â On the plus side they comped us a drink (the drinks are very strong) and frites (yay more SALT!) to cover for the seating snafu.I wanted to like it but overall it was not a great experience. Â Won't be going back unless I hear that Stephanie has fired the line cook whose sole job is to wack a tablespoon of salt on each dish before it is sent out."
"Excellent restaurant. Great Food, Great Ambiance. My wife and I will definately be returning"
"Amazing!! Everything from the atmosphere to the waiters to the food. Â Very pleasant experience. We didn't get anything too wild and the table next to us only got the wild stuff but then they saw our dishes and were slightly jealous they didn't try some of the stuff we had. Â We tried the Chickpea Fritters, Goat cheese tortellini, tempura soft shell crab, sugo, and the grilled pork ribs....Chickpea fritters and sugo were our favorites. Â The sugo was absolutely amazing."
"All those in my party kept thinking during our experience here: Â why the long wait to get reservations to this place?I booked 4 months out online and could only get a 5:45 booking. The space is one of the noisiest restaurants in town.The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu. Â Water glasses refilled promptly. Staff presenting dishes explained them in detail but difficult to understand them (heavy accents and high noise level).We are adventuresome eaters but were intimidated by all the organ meats, etc on the menu but there was Â no need to be. Â Despite the unusual pairings, sauce descriptions, etc., Â many of the items had a non descript taste.For example: Â the wood oven roasted pig face: Â tasted like a bland sausage, no taste to the tongue of the maple suace, tamarind, or cilantro as described.As other reviewers have said, the chickpea fritters were good: Â light, excellent mozzarella. The confit goat belly was the best item of the night but the portion was so small, no taste indication of fennel and very slight amount of lobster and ? crab on the dish despite a $19 price tag.Oysters: Â we sampled the fried pemaquid.described as with egg salad and capers: Â breading on oysters quite salty to my taste and we could not taste the egg salad nor capers.Wood fired walters chicken: Â moist, good taste came with grilled naan for some reason, perhaps to fill one up because of the small size of the chicken and the accompaniments.($23)We tried about 9-10 small plates.Overall, despite the inventive food descriptions, when tasting the dishes we found it difficult to pick up the different flavors Â and the overall taste of the presentations on the whole was not ""ahh,ohh"" as you might have at Alinea (of course Girl and the Goat is of a much different style and price).However, as far as small plate tasting places, we have enjoyed Quartino's and the Publican better.We do have to say that the manager was very attentive to our concerns and did deduct some from our bill because of the issues)"
"I rarely visit a new restaurant unless I hear great things about it from friends who are in the know. Â Went with an open mind and not really expecting to be blown away. Â Well, most of what I've heard about the place was true. Â As soon as we arrived, we were seated right away in the middle of the dining room with a pretty good view of the open kitchen. Â It was 5 PM on a Sunday and the place was packed. Â The waiter went over the menu highlights and made some suggestions. Â We were told two plates per person would be a good number to start with since the plates were ""tapas size"". Â We were starving so we went for a little bit more than the two suggested. Â Well, the waiter was right.The pacing of the food was right on. Â Since the four of us were sharing all the plates, they brought us two complementary dishes at a time so we can savor the food at a relaxed pace. Â The flavors for the most part were really great. Â The sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette was outstanding. Â It had just the right amount of fish sauce to make everything interesting. Â The seared scallops were perfect. Â Crisp on the outside, medium rare on the inside. Â The sauteed shrimp with peanut ragout was another super tasty dish and so was the beef tongue. Â I think of the ten dishes we tried, the chicken empanada was the least successful. Â Sorry to say, it did not live up to the rest of the meal. Â Even though we were feeling quite a bit stuffed, we did not want to leave out dessert. Â We shared the shiitake mushroom gelato with some sort of brownie underneath. Â The gelato was interesting, the brownie was kind a dry. Â It was not up to par with the rest of the meal. Â We'll have to try something better next time.The place was loud but the open kitchen was fascinating to watch. Â Chef Stephanie was expediting and seemed to have everything in control. Â I look forward to going back to sample the ever-changing menu and to watch everyone on the hot line."
"Really lived up to the hype. Â Some of the highlights for me were the cauliflower, sausage stuffed calamari, definitely the famous pig face...and the chocolate cake with shitake sorbet!! Â Way to go Stephanie!"
"Love Top Chef, Love Stephanie Izard! Â Service was on point. Â Food and drinks were just as expected...inventive, simple, and most of all yummy! Â If only I could afford to eat here everyday...A girl can dream!!!"
"Overrated. Â I really wanted to love this place. Â Saturday night. Â Late reservations. Â Two foodie friends in from out of town. Â It had all the makings of a perfect meal. Â We were all dissapointed. Â The breads to start with - delicious. Â We ordered two, which I really wish our server would have stopped us from doing, because it was one too many breads to start out with. Â  From there, the pace, the order the plates came in, our various random servers, and the flavors were all just blah. Â Escargot ravioli? Â Sounds delicious! Â Dissapointing. Â Scallops? Â Meh. Â Chickpea fritters? Â This is not worth the calories. Â Everything was blah to decent, nothing that made me go ""OHMYGODIWANTTOMARRYTHIS!"" Â One note, if it's still on the menu, do not order the goat chorizo flatbread - it was really horrible and reminiscent of Stephanie Izard's heavy handed/too much going on cooking at Scylla. Â There was a good scene there however peoplewise. Â I will probably give it another chance because the hubs still hasn't been, and if I find anything different, I will be sure to update my review."
"Simply put, this place really blew my hair back! The service, the food, atmosphere,....outstanding! My experience was about as close to perfect as you can get."
"This place is super good, and super busy. Â The food is great and unique. Â We tried everything our waitress recommend and enjoyed everything except the desert. Â You can skip that. Â My only complaint about this place is that you have to dry-clean your coat after going because you will smell like you have been at a campfire that you were roasting pig. Â And people may try to eat you because you smell so delicious when you are riding the CTA to work the next day."
"I made our reservation 3 months in advance for a Monday night, and it was definitely worth the wait. I really loved the ambiance. It's a very upbeat (but unfortunately too loud), contemporary restaurant with a fun atmosphere. I went with a group of 5 to celebrate my birthday. Every dish my group ordered was wonderful, and there wasn't one thing I didn't like. The ones that stood out the most were the roasted cauliflower, pork ribs, goat belly, and the pretzel bread. Others in my group really enjoyed the pig face, goat empanadas, and the salmon, except the person who loved the salmon didn't think the blueberries went well with it. The service was quick and timed just right, and the server was very friendly and helpful. I really appreciated that the staff was very attentive with refilling our waters, explaining the dishes as they were brought out, bringing clean plates and taking away dirty ones. The only complaint we had is that they brought out Â the wrong dessert (or so we thought). Since it was my birthday, I chose the quatro leches cake for our group because I absolutely love tres leches cake and was excited to see something similar on the menu. They then brought a cheesecake out with a candle on it and told us it was free. We thought they were still bringing out the one we ordered in addition, but they never did. However, after looking at the menu online today, I realized what they brought us was the correct plate after all. It was not anything like a tres leches cake whatsoever, and it tasted exactly like cheesecake to us, especially because it contained blueberries. We all thought it was the wrong dish. It was still good, but since it tasted like cheesecake and not a tres (or quatro) leches, we were disappointed. Either way, it was an overall great experience, and I would definitely return (if I didn't have to wait 3 months again)."
"Great atmosphere, organized and pleasant staff. Tapas is the the way to go to try a bunch of dishes. From the wood fired oysters to the chickpea fritters, every dish was jumping with flavors. I will be back. Congrats to Stephanie!"
"I have been to Girl & the Goat several times. The wait staff is always friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The food is consistently really good and flavorful. This last visit, however, distinguished Girl & the Goat from other restaurants. My boyfriend, best friend and I ordered the Goat Ribs. It turned out a little tough, but it still tasted good. We weren't complaining. However, our waitress, Marti, must have noticed that we had a difficult time cutting the ribs. She stopped by to ask us about it and offered to take it back to cook a little more. A few minutes later, one of the managers stopped by to ask us about it as well. We were fine with it. Marti stopped by again to explain to us that they had recently gotten some larger goats and that the cooking staff hadn't quite mastered the temperature/times for the larger ribs (probably not her words exactly, but you hopefully get the idea). She apologized again and offered us some dessert on the house, which was delicious. I really appreciated that she cared enough to give that kind of attention despite how busy it was. Her and the manager were very concerned that we had a good dining experience."
"Fantastic! Â I went here for my birthday in September 2010. Â I'm a little late for my review but still remember the meal. Â Everything we ordered was stellar! Â The staff was also out of this world. Â I ended up meeting the chef at the end, snapped a photo, and autographed menu wishing me a happy birthday! Â We have been meaning to return but the wait list is so long right now. Â Soon..."
WOW .......I waited 3 months from the time I booked my trip and made my reservation to be able to eat at Girl and Goat .....I was so excited when we finally sat down I thought my head was going to explode .......then the food came and everything I ever dreamed a meal could be unfolded in front of me ......outstanding .......if I am ever going back to Chicago I will do whatever I need to to get another table ........just amazing ...........
Outstanding and highly recommended. Â I suggest that you try the scallops.
My niece followed one of the chef shows and gave us a gift certificate to this place- waited 3 month for a Sunday reservation and then it was at 4:30- and that is the only negative thing I can say- waiter was glorious in answering questions about ingredients and in checking for my allergy (honey)- we were 2.5 meat eaters and 1 lone non-meat eater (me)- the half is because the niece is pregnant- Of the 10 items we had (you could live with 2 a piece but couldn't resist) the top of the list was melt in your mouth hallibut- top sauce was a vanilla bourban sauce on goat belly (I sopped some up with the fennel on the plate)- Â the shishito peppers in miso parmesan were fought over- blueberries were everywhere in dishes- we left at 7:15 totally satiated and entertained- forget the hype go becasue it is an extraordinary dining experience
"Came here one night with my bf and two friends after seeing an opera so it was pretty late ~ 1030pm for dinner...BUT IT WAS STILL PACKED!We had made reservations beforehand, so no waiting involved! :) :)The ambiance was very rustic like, tables were large planks of wood which I loved. Silverware was great (I know, weird thing to comment on, but I appreciate solid clean silverware). As said many times before me, dishes are divided into three categories, based on their ""main"" ingredients although as our waiter informed us, there's a lot of crossover.It's too bad that we were still full from an earlier meal we had which was super cheap food and poorer quality in order to not get distracted during the opera. Otherwise the food would have been 100000x better. However, these couple dishes still stuck out and were great to munch on.1) Ham pomme frites - i believe, i'm sorry if i butcher the names. Two great sauces, also great alone2) Scallops! - seared to perfection! 3) Pig face - sadly, we had hoped it would come out looking like a pig's face but alas, it just looked like regular meat. But very very tender and very rich flavor. :)Definitely will return, next time, MUST make sure my stomach is ready for the delectable food."
Ive had the pleasure of dining here both in the bar and dinning room and i am a big fan. the green beans with fish sauce was one of the most delicious veggie dishes i have had recently. i tried a couple of their whiskey based cocktails and i remember that the old fashioned was very very good. our server Danielle was a rock star! she gave the best recommendations and was very friendly.
"The wife and I went here recently for her birthday. Â Two weeks out there were no reservations available for the time we wanted, but decided to walk in, enjoy cocktails and wait for a table to open up. I grabbed drinks for us. Â They have a great selection of whiskeys, which I appreciate. Â I ordered a Buffalo Trace for myself, 2 cubes, Â and one of their signature drinks for the birthday girl.We were told the wait would be in the neighborhood of 1.5-2 hours. Â The nice thing is that you can sit in and around the bar area and can access the entire menu. Â This is a great idea, considering this is THE it spot right now. Â Side note- Â This place advertises as casual, which the wait staff embraces. Â DO NOT be discouraged when you walk in and see the cast of Sex and the City there, and you have jeans and an Ed Hardy t-shirt on. Â The wait staff will like you all the same.We waited only 45 minutes for a table, sweet. Â Right next to the kitchen they have 2 huge tables, which are actually community tables. Â Kind of nice to sit next to people you're not even with and watch what they order and get ideas.Tony was our server. Â Knowledgeable, helpful and gave great advice as to the menu. Â I won't go into detail about how to order because going there for the first time and getting the lay of the land is part of the fun.To say the food is fantastic is putting it way too simply. Â The menu Chef Izzard has put together relies on brilliantly layering flavors and textures. Â This was evident in every single dish we had, from the roasted beets to the scallops to the skirt steak. Â I was happy to see the same amount of care given to a veg dish as to a meat or fish dish.We will be back sooner rather than later, and I suggest you shake your tail feather over there as well."
"Go to Girl and the Goat. Â Seriously.We had a 7:15pm reservation and we weren't seated untl about 7:40pm. Â We thought that since 2 of our party arrived a little after 7:15 (and they were clearly booked solid) that perhaps our reservation had been bumped. Â That was not the case at this anything-but-pretentious establishment. Â The hostess ensured us that we would be seated right away and that because of the weather everybody's rezzie was pushed back a little bit. Once we were seated the food began to arrive- as a ""thank you for your patience"" we received at least 5 different items from the menu at no charge. Â I was extremely impressed by this.The green beans- ORDER THEM!The ham frites were out of this world.The cauliflower was deelish.I could go on and on about the food but words won't do it justice. Â You just have to try it for yourself.The menu and its flavors were intense and adventurous. The service impeccable and the atmosphere was cozy and welcoming.I can't wait to go back again!!"
"Girl and the Goat deserves all the hype!  i have lived in chicago for 13 years and i am so not the person who goes to the ""new hot"" restaurants where reservations have to be made three months in advance. I figure, so many great restaurants in the city, why would i do that?  i only ended up going to Girl and the Goat for a friends birthday and the reservation was made three months ago by somebody else. Â we were a party of ten and had a great table right near the kitchen, which is open to the dining room. Â our server (woop--s i forgot her name) was great. Â she offered to order for our table after listeing to what everyone likes and any dietary restrictions (i don't eat meat and another diner at our table is vegetarian). Â we were brought the most amazing food! Â chick pea fritters, yum! fried green beans--yum! oysters, never had them so good! Â halibut, double yum! some weird salad--so good we reordered it several times! and omg, a chocolate cake (very brownie-like) with shitake mushroom gelato, you heard me shitake mushroom--amazing!i would recommend this place to anybody (although those who dislike loud restaurants might be bothered.....me? Â i fit right in!) and cant wait to go back!!!Go Stephanie!"
"Just had our experience at Girl and the Goat. Â It was a great meal, as most of the reviews mention. Â However, I have to say that my husband and I both agreed that Avec has better food overall. Â For those familiar with Avec you know that both of these spots have similar tapas style food presentation. Â Reasons Avec is better:- The food is just more memorable. Â Better standard dishes (chorizo stuffed dates!)- More affordable and larger portions - we normally order ~5 dishes at Avec for two people and leave very full. Â With alcohol our total bill is always under $100. Â At GATG we ordered 6 dishes plus bread and dessert and alcohol and our bill was $150 (left feeling about as full). Â Not a horribly overpriced meal for the experience but dollar for dollar Avec wins for sure in our book.What Girl and the Goat has over Avec: - Atmosphere - definitely more of a traditional restaurant and more trendy vibe. Â Nice that you have the option for reservations and non-communal seating.- Drinks. Â Cocktail menu at GATG is unique and drinks are quite good and strong.- Dessert. Â We never really have room for dessert after eating at Avec but nevertheless we're generally disappointed by their limited offerings. Â GATG had a few interesting dessert options and they were quite tasty.- Service. Â While the service at Avec is very good the service at Girl and the Goat is outstanding. Â I really am not sure how they afford to keep so much staff but they definitely deliver some of the most attentive but unobtrusive service I've ever experienced. In summary, if you're a big fan of AVEC you will probably like GATG, just maybe not as much. Â We'll likely come again in order to try a few more options from the menu but Avec will remain our go-to for a no fail great value culinary experience."
"I went here on a week night for a friends 40th Birthday. Â It was incredible! Â We did have reservations and had to wait a few minutes but it was packed. Â By the time we ordered drinks our table was ready. Â Our waiter was so helpful and had great recommendations. Â We asked him if we could meet Stephanie and she did meet us, took a picture with us and signed my friends menu. Â Every dish was wonderful. Â It was more expensive than what I usually do but was well worth it!"
"We had a delicious meal here last Friday. Â I loved the anchovy butter, the pork liver pate, soft shell crab, and shishito- tasty and savory mild peppers. Â The breads were also very good. Â I couldn't pick out a favorite dish because they all were so yummy! The wine pours were on the stingy side. Â We definitely can't wait to go back. Â Dinner went so smoothly, it's hard to believe it just opened."
"Had reservations here for 2 people at 8pm on a Friday night and it seems like the norm that everyone had to wait at least 30 minutes regardless. Â Service was a bit slow in the beginning to take our order but got better as the night went on. Â The food was phenomemal - we had the cauliflower, lamb veal goat, a special which had a thick noodle with some kind of meat (our favorite) and scallops. Â All of it was good - they're served like tapas, but very filling. Â For 2 people 3 -4 plates should be enough. Â The couple next to us had the chicken and its a much larger portion size than all the other dishes. Â  For dessert we had olive oil ice cream (something like that) with dragon's milk (some kind of sweet beer) which was good but the dragon's milk was way to sweet in a weird way - they could have done without it. Â All in all, good experience and great food."
"I've been a few times and always enjoy it, thought it time I yelp about it.Some memorable dishes I've had are the goat masala pizza, the sauteed green beans and my new favorite, bourbon poached lobster & crab. My friend and I split it and I think we should have ordered two it was so good.Everyone always talks about how hard it is to get a reservation, but my boyfriend and I have strolled in around 9:30 or 10 before and sat down within 15 minutes. I know that's later than ""normal dinner time"", but if you don't mind eating later, it is possible to walk in.Our servers have always been attentive and knowledgeable and the hostesses have always been nice, never scoffing when we walk in without a res.The interior is my favorite, after the delicious food!"
"The food was amazing, the staff was super friendly and helpful, the decor was awesome (had the feel of a bar or tavern), the prices were reasonable, and we got to see Ms. Top Chef! Â We ordered quite a few items off the menu, and each one was delicious. Â My personal favorite was the Pig Face."
"I've been waiting forever to try this restaurant and finally had the chance to go to take my mom for her birthday. Â Although reservations are such a hassle and maybe sometimes a 2 month wait, I'd say it definitely worth it! Â My mom doesn't eat much meat so it was great that we had a variety of seafood selection to choose from. Â The aroma of this restaurant was just amazing that you already know the food is going to taste good. Â Now onto the food we ordered, we ordered one of the house breads which I think is worth trying because they are made fresh daily. Â We also had the wood fire oysters which were so tasty. Â The Nantucket bay scallops, I can't even begin to describe how the flavors put together just melt in your mouth. Â Also we had to order the pig face which seemed to be the must try favorite dish and it was one of my favorite dishes yet, the egg definitely complements the dish in itself. Â All the dishes come out one by one and they explain to you what each dish is, it is also served like family/tapas style. Â  Save some room for dessert because it is definitely worth trying! Â I know they change their menu quite a bit so I will definitely be in again!"
"this place has really strong reviews and i was not at all disappointed when i ate there last night. our waitress was extremely pleasant and gave good advice.the atmosphere was very nice but also very loud, mostly due to there being very little in the space to absorb any sound. lighting was low, similar to many other places on randolph.the only reason this place does not get 5 stars from me is the same reason i avoid a number of other chicago hotspots: even when you have made reservations well in advance, you are not seated until 30-60 minutes after your reservation time. to some extent i understand this because a restaurant cannot know when a given party will finish their meal, but this is a well-established pattern in chicago that, afaict, is built around milking customers for additional revenue at the bar prior to their being seated. i understand this ""keep people at the bar"" game from the perspective of the restaurant owners, who obviously want to maximize their revenue, but i absolutely hate experiencing it at as customer."
"Loved it! A nice variety of dishes. Â Can't wait to go back and see/try new ones. Â All of the dishes were very inventive; really nice combinations. Even with as busy as it was, our server was very helpful and attentive to our needs which is a big plus in my book. Â Definitely lived up to the hype and here's hoping she can keep it up as the menu changes with the seasons."
"After hearing the hype for months, my husband and I went here on Sunday night. Â We went at 4:30, the only reservation available, but no problem. Â It was worth eating early and worthy of the hype.I will say the host service was a little lacking. Â There's 4 people standing around the host stand and none of you can greet us when we walk in? Â Also, we had to wait 5 minutes or so to be seated. Â It's 4:30, how can my table be anything but ready?! Â Finally, we had to ask about checking coats as we were being seated, no one offered. Â Our waitress, however, was great. Â Very friendly and competent. Â Food came out well timed.We did 5 dishes for the two of us, plus one dessert. Â I wish we could have tried more, but we were full on that. Â Highlights: the bread! Â Ours was with mushroom soup butter and tomato soup oil. Â My husband was rolling his eyes over paying for bread instead of getting it for free, but he was practically licking the ramekin of butter by the time we were done. Â Chickpea fritters were also great, as was the goat carpaccio off the special menu. Â The scallops were amazing. Â We were not fans of the goat pizza. Â The flavors were interesting, but I can't say they were good. Â Dessert was bourbon apples with creme fresh. Â None of the desserts really grabbed me - I like my desserts traditional, not lavender flavored gelato, etc., but this turned out to be absolutely delicious."
"This was probably the best professional food I have had! Â We knew we were in for a wait, so went at 5:15ish and said we would wait at the bar. Â Their drinks were tasty, and in about 5 minutes there were seats for us at the bar. Â The bartenders strongly suggest eating at the bar, and the next time we go... we will. Â We wanted the full first experience, but waiting for a table is not necessary at all. Â When deciding what my next drink would be the bartender was very helpful, and threatened a great Manhattan. Â I love Manhattans, and rarely order them, as they are a challenge for some bartenders to make. Â She wasn't kidding. Â She killed it. Â  I think the total wait was probably 1.5 hours for the table, but we were anticipating it, and the bar was awesome, so we didn't mind. Â We tried a ton of food and loved it all. Â The roasted cauliflower was amazing, the green beans outstanding, and the face delicious. Â Top of the list though was the goat, pork and veal sugo pappardelle!!!! Â  Service was great, at both the table and bar! Â We will be back again to eat at the bar! Â Thanks guys! Â We loved it! And it was a great birthday treat!"
"Whoa, this place is so delicious. From the moment you walk in, you smell this meaty, fatty, smoky, savory scent, which is pretty much the theme of the flavors you will have. The ambience and food presentation was sort of earthy and whimsical, like you are a woodland sprite. By far the best part of the experience was the taste and flavors of the food - every single dish we ordered was savory and umami. Even the vegetables must have been infused with pork fat (sounds gross, but it really tasted good). The flavors were so complex, but amazingly not overly rich or disgustingly filling. I have never tasted anything like it!"
"The restaurant is huge and has great ambiance, an astute staff, and a menu that's going to imprint a memory or two. Â Mine will be the slow braised beef tongue, which I would never give thought to trying unless I knew it was going to be done right, and it surely was. Â They also made me a believer in cauliflower, which was roasted to perfection with mint and some jalapenos. Â Holy. Â And don't even think about passing on the wood fired oysters or the clams as they were ridiculously good. Â I could have licked the bowl clean but my girlfriend was there...Decent wine list and interesting desserts. Â This place definitely puts Chicago on the map for innovative and creative food. Â Worthy of a return trip when in the windy city..."
"Two of the dishes we tried were very salty, like a lot of the reviews had mentioned, but we didn't think they were TOO salty. Â Everything we had was delicious; there were a lot of bold flavors- soft shell crab and baby octopus were our favorites. Â Service was friendly and prompt. (Maybe just a little too prompt- the busser took one of our plates away before we finished.) Â The space is wide open so it's extremely loud, but you do get to see Stephanie Izzard working the line. Â I'd go back."
"Food was amazing. Service Good. Place was hopping/noisy but energetic. Said it was our Anniversary dinner and they said they'd 'make it special' but not sure what that means. Was encouraged to have dessert by the server after saying I didn't want any, so I thought maybe I 'should' have it b/c maybe that's how they were going to honor our occasion? Turns out it was just pressure selling. Dessert not free, not special and nothing really happened to acknowledge the day. Had heard desserts were 'meh' and they were and wished I hadn't had one. So be warned. There's nothing wrong with not doing anything for customers who celebrate at a restaurant, but then don't mention that you'll make the night 'special' and do nothing. Otherwise,great find."
"The menu was not to disappoint! Interesting and thought provoking selections, the server was extremely helpful in our quest to order just the right items for us. She was also very astute and informed about different wine pairings. We never felt rushed or hurried, and had an incredibly memorable meal which included something I would never have ordered anywhere else... Â The Goat's Heart. It was the star of the evening for us. I highly recommend it. I fully expect to go again, and cannot wait to see what new and different items are being offered up!"
"For a place that's been open for only a week Girl and the Goat certainly lived up to all the expectations and the hype. Â The chef and her biz partners clearly worked out the kinks before they opened their doors to patrons. Â The space looked great (LOVE the open kitchen concept!!) albeit a little on the loud side, the servers were knowledgeable and uber friendly, the drinks were good though I would recommend sticking with wine.... the wine list was pretty extensive! Â The portions are small but that's because you are meant to order a bunch and share them. Â So don't come expecting to see a 16 oz. steak on the menu cos you will be disappointed. Girl and the Goat ain't exactly cheap but it's worth every penny. Â We ordered a LOT of food (maybe about 60% of the menu?!), 4 cocktails and a bottle of fine Rioja recommended to us by the resident sommelier for about $70 per person. Â All in all, this place gets a 4.5 stars in my book and we have a reservation to come back in a month.Here's our dish-by-dish review.... Oysters (Raw and Fried) - The fried one was better but wouldn't order again... it was good but not greatKohlrabi Salad - Ordered at the suggestion of the server and it was every bit as refreshing and tasty as he said!Soft Shell Crab - Absolutely amazing!!!! I can eat about six of these crabs... in fact next time I just might...... Green Beans - Best green beans I've had in my life... and I am Asian... so that is saying a lot!Clams & Goat Sausage - The white soupy sauce was heavenly but among other items we had it was forgettableHam Frites - We don't eat pork but our friends said it is in the top 5 best fries they had everScallops and Veal Sausage - The scallops are huge and cooked to perfection. Â I would order it again!Braised Beef Tongue - The meat was super tender and flavorful. Â If you are not a fan of beef tongue you will be after thisRabbit Rillete - Pretty standout dish. Â Definitely in the top 3! Â Very delicate and not as rich as I had anticipatedLamb Rib - This was the hubby's favorite dish of the night. Â A bit greasy but I think it's meant to be that way. Quite tasty!!Eggplant & Yoghurt Desert - Very good and very unique! Not sure I'd order it again but I'm not a sweet-tooth so..."
"It is as good as the reviews say it is! If you're lucky enough to get a table, GO! The place is really casual, dim lighting, great service, interesting dishes, and best of all - did not break the bank! I totally expected to spend an arm and a leg, but the prices were very reasonable for the quality of food. My favorite was the open kitchen where you could see the sous chefs moving around and the oven working. Great place to hang with a few friends."
Just stopped by for a pre-dinner drink and to check it out. Â Wine was great and I loved the low tables up front for people to wait or eat at. Â Great thing for us that the other folks at the table had ordered dinner and we got to see a bunch of the dishes come out. Â Everything looked great and I will definitely be back to try.
"The best dining experience we've had in Chicago all year. Outstanding food, outstanding service, outstanding atmosphere. Given how much variety is on the menu, we'd go back often. A great addition to the Chicago scene."
"I am joining the chorus of great reviews. The savory food is uniformly excellent. See below for my quibbles with dessert.Every small dish we had was perfectly prepared, creative and excellent. Four of us had dinner on a Sunday night. We had a reservation and were seated right away. We started with a pretzel loaf (with two infused butters) and a beet salad, which was a combination of beets, greens, and a crumble of white anchovies. The squash ravioli was so good that we went back for a second order. Â The chick pea fritters were nice and crispy on the outside while having an almost potato texture interior; not at all like the falafel I expected. Everything was great but there were two standouts. First, the seared scallops with brussels sprouts. The scallop was sweet and perfectly cooked. The real surprise, though, was the sprout, which was braised with mushroom until it was caramelized perfectly. The other item I particularly enjoyed was a brusselini with watermelon radishes. This was not on the menu, but the waitress knew were were looking for veg items and pointed it our. It is done in a sweet glaze that works well with the bitter greens. The barramundi was only slightly less satisfying as was the goat pizza.If the Girl and the Goat has any room for improvement on the food side, it is dessert. We shared three of the four items on the menu. I don't think I would order any again. One was an olive oil gelato with a crisp of some kind doused in stout beer. It just did not come together as a dish for me. The best was small fritters with chocolate nibs. The other was not memorable. Now for the minimal downsides. The place is loud. If you are hoping for pleasant dinner conversation, understand that you are going to have to work to be heard. Also, the tables are packed fairly tight, but not as tightly as I have seen at other places. Lastly, when I made the reservation, the person on the phone was nice enough to ask whether it was for a special event. I explained that it was for a birthday. Later, I discovered that there were actually two birthdays and I called to inform the restaurant. They told me that was important to them, so I expected at least a nice acknowledgement of the fact. That did not happen. None of these complaints is irrelevant, but none really overcome the really excellent meal. Even with those few complaints and a less than stellar dessert selection, I go five stars without hesitating."
It really is that good. Read the other 400 for why. I would have to look hard for a reason to give this place any less than five stars
"I'd give this place five stars for the food and drinks, but it was so damn noisy that I couldn't talk with my companions! I actually found the pigs face to be the least interesting item - taste-wise - on the menu. Â The deserts were interesting, and tasted good. Â I really liked the pasta dish, and the flatbread."
-Fantastic Food-Great Atmosphere-Stephanie cooks in an open kitchen and even took the time to stop and snap some pictures with us-Professional service-Good bar scene-Tough to get a reservation-Fun to go with a group
"Great food, fresh, very tasty. Service was awesome!!! Dan (the manager) when we went there is cool. He and the staff were super friendly and pay attention to what the customers have to say about the dish. The waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable about their menu. He made right on recommendation that we surely love. I will definitely go back!!!"
"Been here 3 times and won't stop going back. Â I love their beer selection, even though our sever struggled with a couple questions I had. Â I love how the menu is setup to share plates. Â Immediately gets everyone involved with ordering food and creates table conversation on its own. Â Hard to get a table if you walk in, but worth the wait."
"Que RiCO!!!! Â in a word (or two) RICH! For starters, Top notch bar service. Â Alisa was attentive, professional, very knowledgeable about the food options (and very nice). Â I ate at the bar.I opened with the Beets, creme fraiche and beans. Sweet creamy and HEAVY - not a huge fan of the anchovy, but it added necessary salt/balance to the dish. Â Very generous portion and because its veggies (loaded with creme) i HAD to finish the dish.Next up - the lighter Tuna with bacon chunks and other bits. Â So-so, light, but the bacon took over the dish. Â Don't get me wrong, I love the bacon, but it dominated the tuna flavor.I finished with the Sugu (Alisa recomendation). Â It was very tasty, but I was distracted by an extra entre that the Bartender suggested I try. The calamari stuffed with lamb sausage was EXCELLENT. Â I stay away from the sweetbreads, but they added a surprisingy dollop of delicious creme flavor to this dish. Â Give it tryfor service = 5Atmosphere = 3.5Food = 3.5I'd give the Restaurant a 3.5 stars overall, only cuz the food was sooo rich"
dec. 2nd finally rolled around and we had dinner at g and the goat. Â AWESOME! Â roasted cauliflower is to die for! Â as are the chick pea fritters...oh my god! nuff said. Â don't miss this place its worth the wait and service is excellent!!
"We went early, sat at the bar and ordered about 8 things and each one was delicious. Â The bartender made a great Manhattan. Â The fresh bread to start is highly recommended. Â Steph was in the kitchen and it was fun to see her there."
"i cant say enough about this place. these sentiments are echoed in every other review, so i'll keep mine short: make your reservation a month or so in advance and go here"
Absolutely amazing food. Conversation evoking dishes. The staff was passionate about the menu offerings and their chef. Loud but not too loud to have a conversation.
"Date night and we went to Girl and the Goat on Sunday-exactly a week after it opened. Aside from the incredible food, the best part was the fact that the resto already seemed incredibly established. There were no faux-pas as you so often see with brand new openings. Stephanie Izard & her crew were more than professional and friendly to boot. We ordered more food than necessary but enjoyed every bite! 1st Course: Fat Bread! This lived up to all the hype. If I was one of those lucky people who needs to gain weight, I would eat this every day of my life. Main Plates: Crispy Pig Face - rich and delicious w/a refreshing arugula salad Crisp Skate Wing - A really refreshing, light portion Soft Shell Crab - Really intense, refreshing flavors Skirt Steak- It is drizzled in a salted goat's milk caramel sauce that I could drink by the gallon! Dessert: Goat's cheese & blueberries over a brown sugar cake. This was incredible!!!!"
I'm on the band wagon. Â Beautifully done interior...great and thoughtful food. Â Just order a bunch. Â Giving a 4 because they serve the smallest pours of wine in Chicago.
"1. The Arrival - This place is rather bustling so be prepared to be seated later than your reservation time. Â We waited 45+ mins to be seated as was most people around us.2. The Ambiance - The decor is dark wood with dim incandescent quality lighting with most of the light coming from the exterior and kitchen area. Â An atmosphere appropriate for most occasions.3. The Order - The small plates with entree price tags are designed to be shared. Â Although 2 plates are recommended per person, we were quite satisfied after 1.5 plates per person. Â 4. The Taste - The food had interesting composition with a nice mix of different ingredients. Â Overall quite tasty but several of the dishes (esp. Short Ribs) were overly salty, where the natural flavors of the ingredients were taking a back seat. Â I assume that's why no condiments were provided. Â I think saltiness aside, the food was good.5. The Judgement - If you don't mind a 45 + min wait, relatively high price to food ratio, and a potentially hyper-salty experience, then give G&G a try. Â I think the dishes have the potential to provide a unique gastronomic experience if you can actually taste the ingredients."
This is by far the best restaurant I have been to in a long time. Â I've eaten there twice and each time it was amazing. Â Very creative dishes that are both tasty and hearty. Â The oysters are fantastic and the green beans are like crack. Â I wish I had enough room to try everything on the menu. Â Some of the ingredient and pairings are brilliant.
Everything was beyond incredible. Â Had a 11:30 pm reservation on Friday and was seated promptly and at a great table. Â Ordered 2 dishes per person (3 people) to share and was absolutely stuffed at the end. Â The scallops and mussels were definitely the highlights. Â The roasted brussel sprouts and squash ravioli didn't disappoint though. Â Tongue & goat cheese pizza were extremely rich and luscious. Â Going back with mom and sister right after Thanksgiving!
"I've been to Girl and the Goat twice now and loved it! Everything I ate was delicious. Here are my top picks:Chickpea FrittersSquash RavioliWood Oven Roasted Pig FaceThey also had a drink I loved - I can't recall the name but it had grey goose, Pimm's, Cucumber and Mint I believe. I highly recommend it!"
"I enjoyed this place and I would certainly go back, but this won't be on my ""regular"" list. It is a fun, lively atmo and the food is good and fresh with a unique flavor. Here is what I liked: Good group atmo, nice service, fun for sharing, etc. The cauliflower was tasty and the fried chickpeas are mighty fine, too. What I didn't like: Didn't care for the skirt steak as it was super salty and the lamb sausage wasn't anything unique in terms of its taste. Â The food overall tasted similar to Avec's menu and if I had to choose between the two, I would have to choose Avec."
"Every dish was phenomenal, as was the wine. The baby octopus was probably my favorite. Just go."
"This is one of the best dining experiences I have had in Chicago this year!Upon entering we were greeted by several friendly hostesses who promptly sat us.We went with a group of 8, so we sat at one of the large rustic tables near the open kitchen. Â Our waiter was perfection- he was attentive, but not in our face the whole time. Â Because we had such a large group, we decided to let him choose our meal. Â The menu is great for a large group and we had it served tapas style, but you could certainly course it out for each person if you wanted. Â Some of my favorites were the green salad, chick peas three ways and the yellowtail/pork belly. Â The sommalier was also fantastic at giving us a selection of whites and reds throughout the meal. Â I the a pimm's cocktail and it was awesome as well. Â The dessert menu sounded a bit odd, but we ordered most of it to try and it was all tasty! At the end of the meal, Stephanie (the head chef/owner) came over for a picture with the table and chatted with us for a bit.Overall, there is not one thing that was lacking in this experience. It was perfection!"
"Finally went on Friday night and it was amazing! I have been a fan of Stephanie Izard's since Scylla so I was so excited to try Girl and the Goat. Our server was on his third day of service on the floor and he did a great job. He was well-informed and comfortable. Since this is a small-plates restaurant, my fiance and I shared all of the courses.We started with fresh bread. I can't remember what type of butter it had - I believe it had anchovies in it - but it was so fresh.We followed that with one of the specials - a sugo with a meat sauce (that included goat). It was fantastic. One of my favorite of the night. I hope it becomes a permanent fixture on the menu.After that, at our server's request, we had the green beans. They were out of this world. They are incredible. You must have them.Then we had the crudo, which was good. I think having that follow three really spectacular dishes, it just wasn't at the top of my list of what I loved. But it was good nonetheless.For our meat dish, we had flank steak. Again it was really good but I think if I went back I would order the goat pizza. We were really torn because everything looked so good.The service was great. My one complaint was that they were a little ""clear friendly"" - every time I turned around they were clearing our table. However, this did ensure that my water glass was always full. Even though Girl and the Goat is significantly larger than Scylla was, it is wonderfully decorated and really doesn't feel overwhelming at all. It's very comfortable and I really liked the dark, burnt wood. I highly recommend Girl and the Goat. It was an awesome experience and I'm sure once the slight kinks are worked out, it's going to be just perfect for a night out in Chicago."
I highly reccomend this restaurant. The food was amazing! Step out of the boc and try the Pig Face dish.
"I only went to the bar to conduct business, but it looked great! Unfortunately I didn't try the food but the beer selections were great. The aesthetics were very nice and the ambiance had great energy! I definitely will have to come back to try the food. But from what I saw, I would recommend it..."
"Just changed my last meal request from Â my mom's home cooked to the cauliflower dish, the out of the world chocolate toffee dessert all washed down with the bourbon cocktail with top-notch service. Mom will understand."
Amazing small plates!
"I went with a group of friends and made our reservations a month in advance. Such a cozy place with a great atmosphere. When you walk in the door it is busy and is now a place to ""see and be seen"" as it is new and hot. You can smell the wood burning oven as soon as you walk in the door which only adds to the ambiance. As for the food, the plates are meant for sharing the portions are small. We had: Apple Nut Bread Chickpea Fritters Pork Belly Short Ribs (on the specials menu) Goat cheese pizza Donuts Bourbon Apple Dessert The apple/nut bread was warm and delicious! My favorite was Chickpea Fritters as they were very flavorful. The short ribs and the goat cheese pizza were both divine! The desserts however, left little to be desired...the donuts were burnt and the Bourbon apple dessert was tasty there was something off about it. I would go back here for the food and the ambiance but if I would skip the dessert."
"Good food, good ambiance, good beer/wine list, good service...this is why you dine out. We sat at the bar and only tried a few plates, but the highlight were the razor clams."
"Girl and the Goat was absolutely great, one of the best meals I have ever had. A few observations:- The menu was far larger than I was expecting... With all of the reviews mentioning the same dishes, I was prepared for a menu with maybe 8-10 items on it. Â Rather, there are about 10 items in each of the columns (Veggies, Fish, and Meat). Â - There were people having dinner in the waiting area and at the extended table at the end of the bar. Â If you really want to eat at this place and don't have a reservation, I would just go, and it looks like they will accommodate as long as you are flexible. - The coursing is unpredictable, so be prepared to be overwhelmed with food all at once. Â The table next to us ordered at the same time. Â Our food came out at a perfect pace, and theirs literally came all at once. Â They were a bit flustered. Â Just a heads up."
"Great place, the pork liver mouselline was worth calling home for."
"If you have the pleasure of being served by Marty and James (the bar manager) you will truly have a wonderful dining experience. We were a group of four and here is what we devoured: roasted cauliflower, chickpeas fritters, grilled baby octopus, wood fired taunton bay oysters, lamb sausage stuffed calamari, grilled skirt steak, mixed seafood special (new on the menu), and at least 2-4 other plates which I can't remember because we went out until 5am... enough said. Overall, tasty food, great drink selection, polite service and attention, comfortable atmosphere!!!"
Parpadelle is among the best dish i've ever had in the city of chicago. Â Will go back for that alone. Â This place lives up to the hype.
"I've been about ten times, and it's always excellent. Â Creative menu, and comfortable environment. Â It's tough to get a reservation, but you can usually get a seat at the bar in 20 minutes."
"How can a restaurant receive more than 1 star when they turn away business? I would have felt more generous to up the rating to 2 stars; had the Manager on Duty not completely failed at recovering (not once, but twice) from the TERRIBLE customer service exuded by both the hostess stand and reservations system. Setting the scene: Monday afternoon at 4:30pm...two walk-in guests looking for a late lunch/early dinner after a rough day of meetings in the Loop. I called around 4pm to ensure the kitchen would be open and after waiting on hold for 2+ minutes, was disconnected and just assumed the Internet was accurate and continued on my journey to West Randolph. Walking in; we were met by fake plastered smiley ""holier than tho"" hostess staff of four - clearly too busy at this early hour to take telephone reservations; but quick enough to say that they weren't able to seat us in the dining room because we didn't have reservations and they were ""booked""...booked?!? I asked, astonished, staring at their cold faces blocking my way into their EMPTY dining room (not one table was taken). I pleaded that I had tried to call a half hour earlier, but was disconnected while on hold. Too irritated to wait any longer for an apology that clearly was not in their nature to present, I excused myself from their blessed, important presence before I reacted out of shock; I tend to have a short fuse when I am hungry.Frankly, I do not care how many positive reviews this place/chef receives; if you fail at serving your customers than what is the point of a great dining experience. Parading your front of house staff around like they are apart of a team worthy of comparison to Trotters is the most off-putting and scathing way I can imagine to present your food. I was so disappointed I even called back to make a reservation as they had ""suggested I had done in the first place"", and try to be the bigger person when (after another 2 minute wait on hold) was cheerfully told by a hostess that walk-ins were welcome at this early hour and we shouldn't have a problem being seated. The nerve!"
"This place is soooo good I could eat here every night. Â Everything about the Goat is top notch- the Food, the Service and the Ambiance. Â It's rare that a new restaurant gets everything right immediately, but from my perspective that has happened here.I like the quirkiness of the menu and how the chef marries tastes that I have not seen before. Â While it would be easy to suggest a few standouts on the ""regular menu"", I encourage you to turn your decision over to the service staff who are enthusiastic and knowledgeable and opinionated about what they are serving. Â In four trips I have never gone wrong with the advice of the servers.The other thing I love about the Goat: It is FUN!!! Â Everything about the restaurant is fun. Â For me it is a celebration of food and drink...I only wish I lived closer and could visit more often."
"Phew -- so glad I loved this since I went in with very high expectations. Â Normally, I'm not a small plates girl -- too much work to order and too much disparity in flavors makes me feel slightly queasy at the end of the meal. Â What's great about GATG is that while there is tremendous variety in the menu the flavors are still complimentary to each other so you feel like you've had a harmonious experience. Â Standouts to me were the octopus, pigface and the sogu (sp) pasta dish which had these awesome gooseberries that delighted in the otherwise savory experience. Â The beet dish and desserts were fine but not that special (I hate frisee and so does everyone I know). Â Atmosphere was cool, more casual, bit loud but who cares. Â Thanks Stephanie!"
"Sooooooo good!Top Chef is our favorite show, and we cheered for Stephanie every week.Surprised my wife with reservations for her 30th birthday. Â Really cool atmosphere (dark and cozy) and music (indie rock and 80's).Great beer and wine list.Our server was Brennan (best waiter ever). Â He recommended we start with one of their three breads. Â We got the pretzel bread to start with...I would request this for my last meal, if i knew when i was going to Â die. Â It was so light and salty and buttery and warm and...incredible.The menu is all small plates, so you can share everything and try lots!We tried: the stew of the day, which was braised veal and escargot. Â The warm skirt steak salad. Â The pumpkin scallops with fried brussel sprouts. The spicy chickpea fritters. Â and the wood oven roasted pig face with fried egg on top.Every single dish had wow factor and was instantly devoured. Â For desert we had the chocolate beignets and some port.Incredible meal. Amazing service. We loved the open kitchen so you can see everyone hustling back there, creating mouth-watering dishes. Unfortunately, Stephanie wasn't working that night.Cannot wait to go back with friends!"
"Service and location are first rate. Menu is truly unique with most selections locally grown and many items of the never before tasted variety. Went with a group of 4 and each of us ordered 2 of their selections. The stecca, fried pemaquid, sauteed green beans, bourbon apples (dessert) and walter's chicken were all excellent, while the grilled baby octupus, pan roasted red fish and goat belly confit were all good, and the confit turkey chilaquiles and wood oven roasted pig face were not as good. It's all a matter of personal preference and taste, however. Since each dish is so unique, I would have preferred a clean plate and clean cutlery with each course, but they weren't provided unless asked for. Not for kids or families on a budget, but great for socializing with friends."
"Honestly, I really guess I don't see what all the hoopla is about. Â Me and my boyfriend went here on this last weekend. Â We were really excited to try some different things on the menu, but when we asked our server questions about the items she made us feel sort of stupid. Â I'm sorry if I don't know what fried pig face is? If it was the restaurant down the street... sure.....it'd be good, but not the number one restaurant in Chicago?"
"It doesn't get better than this. Anywhere. Period! Along our culinary tour across America, my boyfriend and I were shocked when we learned that this place literally requires reservations months in advance. Thanks to a friend and some luck, they squeezed us in at 11:45pm on a Friday night! We arrived early and enjoyed a glass of wine at the bar. (I love the large wine glasses here with no stems!) The server in the waiting area politely told me he would bring my second glass of wine to the table as soon as it came up. I really appreciated his willingness to go the extra mile, and I definitely tipped accordingly. Our server was wonderful! She was very knowledgable, friendly, attentive and just perfect! She helped us decide which dishes to order and was very confident which is a must considering the creativity that goes in to dishes like pig face and foie gras fluff with the brownie. The sea bass blew us away! The food runner and busser were exceptional. We loved the green beans, and the soft shell crab. The chickpea fritters were awesome! The BEST octopus I have ever had! The sauteed skae wing was great, and the foie gras fluff with the brownie, OMG! I gave the Purple Pig 5 stars too, but there was something about the Girl & the Goat that was just above and beyond in the flavor department. It's worth every minute of waiting and every bite will take away your breath!"
"Fabulous! Â Our waiter was outstanding! Almost every dish we had was wonderful with layer upon layer of flavor goodness. Â Beyond fabulous: Â beets, chickpea fritters, calamari, scallops, goat pizza (the neighboring table gave us some of theirs because it is large), apple dessert. Â Not so fabulous: short ribs (I have read others reviews of this dish and it does not seem like we got it on a good night -- tough little pieces) and doughnut nibs -- now it was probably the nibs but it had an overall burnt taste. Â My drinks were spot on to go with the food -- I stuck with a great beer during dinner and had a wonderful dessert wine at the end. Â The place is packed! Â The next day I made reservations for December - can't wait to try some other dishes."
"first of all, read all the raving reviews, and had to bring my bf here for his bday trip despite what people have said about the menu for veggies. Â so lucky to get reservations again! Â anyway, my bf polished 3 plates on his own, which shocked our waitress. Â i got 2 veggie items, which were definitely meant to be sides, but the cauliflower was still good. Â i actually really liked the wine, especially their personal blend. Â my bf got the red blend which was really rich but good. Â love the set up, tons of people there, it was hard to get to my seat! Â if only they had more veggie options, sigh... but my bf was satisfied! Â pricing is great too."
"We were very impressed with this (in our opinion) hard to categorize place. Â We arrived early on a weekend evening. Â We had reservations and were seated promptly after our arrival. Â The restaurant includes a bar area with some couches near the window and some tables in the bar area as well as a dining area. Â The restaurant has a dark interior despite the wall-to-wall windows at the front of the restaurant fronting on Randolph. Â The food was phenomenal. Â Each choice was loaded with different textures and flavors that blended well together. Â Highly recommended were the green beans, soft-shell crabs and goat meat pizza. Â Plates are intended for sharing and should be ordered, tapas-style with the expectation that you will consume 2-3 orders per person. Desserts were a mix of savory and sweet and expand the concept of a Â traditional dessert. Â Bread is apparently not complimentary, but is ordered (and paid for). Â We tried the ""fat bread"" served with liver butter (almost like a liver pate, but lighter) and thought it was wonderful. Â Evidently, the ""bread"" offerings change daily. Â There were a few interesting choices of wine by the glass that avoided the ubiquitous Â chardonnay-infested by the glass wine choices for white wine (there was one chardonnay choice). Â The bottle listings are well thought out and we chose a nice Cab-Merlot blend Â that we enjoyed.Service was efficient. The servers were knowledgeable about what was on the menu and on the wine list. Â We were not rushed. Â The place was full, but not jam-packed when we were there (though we Â arrived and left somewhat early in the evening).We will come back."
"We seem to have a bad track record going out on birthdays and hoped to break the trend with TGTG... Kinda.We were seated immediately - surprising on a Saturday night. The place was a good looking space and smelled wonderfully of woodsmoke. Our waiter came by very quickly to give us the patter about small plates and any questions, then he left without asking if we wanted drinks. The food was very good - we ordered wheat bread with honeycomb and peanut butter, bacon & banana spread. The banana had a too strong, overripe taste that had us eating without using spread but the bread was sooooo good.Each of the plates; beets, scallops, shortribs & frites, were very good - interesting and yummy, but we were surprised that our plates were never changed for fresh, then saw each of our neighboring tables being given fresh plates several times.Each time a waitstaff member came in to work on the tables next to ours they rubbed past my husband and bent over, causing him to wonder if he was supposed to kiss the presented butt.Don't plan on conversing - please. The couple next to us were arguing and HAD to yell to be heard by each other. Awkward."
"Girl & the Goat is wonderful! With our reservation we were seated immediately. A casually comfortable setting, informal atmosphere and ""good-vibe"" background music. Plain wood tables; no white tablecloths. Only downside is that general loudness and poor acoustics make conversation difficult. Shared five dishes, all great: chickpea fritters, goat-meat empanadas, sweet potato gratin with fried onions on top, kalbi beef ribs, and a surprisingly hefty pork shank with crispy crackly skin (not exactly a ""small plate"") - all very good but due to amount of food we could've probably omitted one of the five dishes. Shared some kind of decadently chocolaty dessert. My wife had a glass of chardonnay. I had two glasses during the meal of a good Chicago craft beer they had on tap, (can't recall name of it,) and a decaf coffee with dessert. Service very good. Not inexpensive but not ridiculously pricey either. Total bill for the two of us with 18.5% tip was (I believe) something like $157"
"If I could give more stars, I would.....I went there earlier this month with 6 of my friends for a little 'girl's night out.' Â We were told to order about 2 dishes per person, as the plates are meant to be shared. Â Highlights: chickpea fritters, sauteed green beans, squash ravioli (best I've ever had), scallops, goat/pork/veal sugo, roasted lamb shank, and believe it or not, oven roasted pig face. Â It was all amazing.The restaurant feels like something cozy you would find in Napa Valley. Â It has a very rustic and comfortable 'homey' feel to it. Â The wait staff was phenomenal and very eager to explain the dishes and suggest wine pairings. Â Can't wait to go back!"
"The food, service, and atmosphere were as amazing as I anticipated- every dish was delicious and I immediately made reservations after we left! Â It is definitely worth the wait and lives up to all the hype."
"Don't be fooled - this is not a small plate restaurant. Â In retrospect, our server led us astray - suggesting 2-3 plates per person. Â 1-2 would have been more than sufficient. Â Specifically, the chicken and the pork shank options were in fact large entrees. Â Vegetarians be forewarned - this is NOT the restaurant for you. Â Two of the vegetarian dishes contained ingredients that were not vegetarian. Â Overall, dishes were very heavy, complicated and did not complement each others which confused the palate and upset the stomach. Â Frankly we left more than half of the food on the table - and none of us wanted to take it home. Â We wont be back. Â Ever. Â PS - My husband puked in the bathroom. Â Seriously."
"Hello Stephanie Izard, winner of Top Chef: Chicago. It's about time. After the snag of wanting to call her West Loop joint The Drunken Goat, The Girl and the Goat has finally opened. The menu rotates, so what is reviewed here may or may not be available on any given night. Enter the scene: dark wood stained tables and decor in a warehouse feeling which perfectly matches the surrounding environment of the west loop. Izard did a very nice job integrating the physical space and creating a warm, yet clean atmosphere. A wood burning stove viewable from the house works away as Izard watches over her minions carrying out her orders of the night. The word ""goat"" isn't just in the name...goat is served. Not just our traditional thought of goat cheese, but the actual animal. Goat is starting to show up on more menus of Chicago restaurants these days. The menu is divided up into vegetable, fish, and meat dishes all meant to order and be shared. Think tapas, but a bit larger portions. (My dining partner and I split 3 full dishes, 1 ""appetizer"" and a loaf of bread and that was plenty!)Izard features many handcrafted Midwestern beer (anyone who features Metropolitan Brewery beers on draft is respected in my book)I started the evening with Corny Goat, a crispy loaf of bread served with corn relish and goat cheese butter. The bread was hearty, none of the 99 cent crap one buys in a grocery store. The corn relish provided some tang to balance out the creamy richness of the goat cheese butter. Step two involved the veal sausage served with sungold tomatoes. I was a bit apprehensive to take on this dish only because it's a bit early in the growing season for good sungolds, but to my surprise, the tomatoes were perfect! The veal sausage had really good flavour and was seasoned nicely, but the sausage itself was a bit dry. And then came the Ham Frites. Wow. Served with a pepper aioli and swiss cheese dip, these cut fries were sprinked in flake salt and ham. Amazing. Two words: GREEN BEANS. By far the best dish I experienced of the night. If anyone can perfectly cook a green bean, it's the line staff at Girl and the Goat. My wonderful host, Lindsay described this dish as ""If you want to see Stephanie and what she is all about, this is the dish."" Served with a mouth puckering fish sauce vinegarette and topped with crushed cashews, if you go to Girl and the Goat, this is the must have! Unfortunately, I was not a fan of the goat pizza. If picked off the pizza, the actual goat meat was fantastic, but there was just something wrong with the dish as a whole. The clumps of ricotta cheese sprinkled atop were washed out by the bold sweet flavours of the sauce. I found it to be too sweet and clashed with the savory aspects of the dish. Being a newborn on the Chicago restaurant scene, Girl and the Goat has done well. They seemed to have avoided some of the glitches new restaurants often have. The only one operational criticism I have is that they needed to slow down. I felt things were brought out way too fast. It's a personal preference, so if you don't mind having the house bring out one dish at a time, one after another, their system will probably work well for you. Girl and the Goat has lived up to the chatter. Book now cause you're gonna be waiting for a while, but it will be well worth it."
"The three star rating is probably in part due to my having hugely overblown expectations due to the hype. Â But a few thoughts on why this doesn't get the highest rating.1) First Impressions: I'm not a fan of huge spaces with very little to dampen the noise and unflattering overhead lighting. Â It was very loud - too loud. Â While waiting to sit, I started to get crabby about all the different shirts on the waitstaff (they contain wording that some might think is cute, but for some reason I found kind of annoying...no idea why...perhaps it was related to my cocktail (see #2)).2) I was underwhelmed by my cocktail (can't recall the name, but it was made with Pimm's). Â I've had many different Pimm's cocktails, and this one was not enjoyable - kind of sour, but not in a good way. Â (My husband did have a great old fashioned -- if not traditional -- no muddling of fruit. Â I also had an awesome Sazerac.).3) Our waiter was rushed - spoke way too quickly, and with the noise level there we missed about 1/4 of everything he said.We had:- bread with garlic and anchovy butter- wood fired oysters- roasted califlower- baby octopus- stuffed calamari- sugo pappardelleThe califlower and pappardelle were wonderful. Â If fact, I almost think the small plate thing worked against them for me, because if I'd only had these two things, I would have given the place a higher rating. Â All the other dishes I found were good, but not really anything I'd be dying to have again.So they lose one star for service and atmosphere issues and one star for the good, but not amazing dishes.Overall I would recommend going - it's well priced and I certainly felt I got my money's worth. Â But it's not up to all the hype in my opinion."
"When in town... GO!I went with two friends and had one amazinggggg meal. Â It lived up to and surpassed any hype. Â The interior of the restaurant was nicely done, the service was knowledgeable and helpful and most importantly the food was phenomenal. Â my friends and I left stuffed due to the following:1. Fat Back spread2. peter piper bread3 goat pizza4. roasted cauliflower5. Chickpeas 3 ways6. Goat Meatballs and Escargot7. Skirt Steak8. The Scallops9. The Pig FaceI was not disappointed in any of them... HOWEVER if the fatback is available on special... GET IT! and to my friends suprise the cauliflower was one of the BEST things we ate... it is NOT to be missed!!!all in all... when I am in town... I will go again!!!!"
"I wish I could give this 11 stars!! Â The Girl & the Goat was absolutely FABULOUS!! Â From the moment we walked in the door the service was impeccable. Â Although the restaraunt was packed, it seemed like we were the only ones in the place due to the attentiveness of our waitress & the many servers/bus people. Â Our waitress was patient and answered every single question we had (it was our first time there so we had a ton) she gave us recommendations on how to make our selections as well as which ones were her favorites. Â We ordered a bunch of plates and a bottle of wine for the 4 of us. Â The dishes started coming out quickly - we were never without food on the table once the first plate came. Â OMG was that food DELICIOUS!!! Â There was nothing we tried that we didn't like. Â Even the pig face which we were all skeptical about was amazing!! Â It was without a doubt the best downtown dining experience I've had since visiting the Purple Pig last year!"
"So, second time at GATG and felt disappointed this go round, mainly due to very shoddy service. I made the reservations for our party of four over three months earlier. We arrived on time and had to wait for our table for maybe 15 mins. That's fine in most restaurants but GATG is so busy that the management have decided to let people eat at the low tables in the waiting area. Everyone else gets to stand huddled together at the door, blocking the way for the servers barging through with drinks and food. Once seated, we are served pretty quickly with appetizers (the very delicious bread...onion brioche and tarragon butter was almost the best thing of the night). The water guy came by twice and literally threw water in our glasses, spilling it over the table in the process. This was apparently showmanship and not a horribly intrusive and impolite way of serving your guests. The food, as many other reviewers have stated, is pretty good, inventive fare. We tried about ten dishes and the outstanding ones were the cauliflower, kompachi crudo and beef cheeks. Just meh were the goat empanadas, pork shank (what IS the point of fake kimchee sauce paired with buttermilk sauce and naan bread??) and sugo (great pappardelle but an over-salty sugo). Our server drifted in and out a couple of times, but mainly we were served our food by guys whose accents were impenetrable as they introduced the dish and who had zero interest in our experience with the food. As we finished off with grapefruit kulfi (most pedestrian and unappetizing presentation of a dessert I have seen in a restaurant of this caliber), another random ""hostess"" dropped by to clean crumbs off the table and ask if everything had been delicious. She smiled vaguely at our response, without eye contact, and floated away. Which, really, summed it all up."
"As many others have posted, the wait to get a reservation at G&G is extensive. I made the reservation at the end of May and didn't get in until the middle of August. We went there for my birthday. The ambiance is unique and makes you feel special. The wine and beer list was perfectly selected. In addition the service was top notch. However, I feel as the menu is for a mature pallet, if you will. The cauliflower was the best item we ordered. We also ordered the ribs, ham fries, and pig face (per recommendations from previous patrons). I have to say that the pig face was something that I could barely swallow. The texture was exactly how one would predict a pig's face of feeling. We did not order dessert, as every item was some how infused with goat or pig. As I have mentioned, my pallet may need to mature for me to appreciate G &G. Considering the wait for this place is extensive, I am surprised we were let down by the menu."
"Wait was crazy, two and a half hours. Â The foods was ok but so much great food in this city. Â No need to wait so long for so so food. Â  Wait staff was friendly and attentive"
"Can't say too much more than what's already been said....This place is simply amazing in every way.We got to sit up close at one of the two kitchen side tables. Â You're in for a real treat if you've ever wanted to see the inner workings of the kitchen. Â We got to watch the chef's prepare the dishes and even though they were super busy, they still made time to chit chat with us as they worked.Stephanie was just to our left making sure everything went out perfectly. Â She brought one of our dishes to us and talked with us for a few moments... that was definitely pretty cool.All in all, this goes to the top of our list and we will definitely be returning!"
"We really enjoyed this place after waiting to go for what seemed like forever! We were seated shortly after we arrived for our reservation and were luckily seated right at the pastry station bar! We were beyond excited to be so close to the action! The waitstaff were all very pleasant and helpful, freely giving suggestions. The pastry team was a hoot to watch and converse with, even giving us a small sample of a dessert we were torn between! The cocktails were good. Overall, it was a great evening and experience and we will definitely be back and will recommend it in the future!"
"Super splendid, delicious, best meal experience I've ever had. Â Please eat whatever was the raw fish I had with pork and other things on it."
"My friend made a reservation in October! And our reservation finally came! Seemed sooo ridiculous that a place would have that long of a wait... but I am shocked to say that it was worth it! The food was amazing. We shared about 13 plates between 6 of us, and all were outstanding. Even the bread was the best I've ever had! It does end up getting pricey when you're ordering so many dishes, but you get a lot of food for what you'll spend. I think my favorites were the lamb sausage stuff calamari, the raw oysters, and the scallops. Unfortunately, like lots of other Chicago restaurants, the majority of the wine list STARTS at $50. That's a bit pricey for girls in their early twenties. We did find the only two less expensive bottles, around $35 each, and ordered those. Only get to a somewhat offensive look from the waitress who said, ""did you see all the other bottles?"" ... ""Yes, ma'am we did... we just want to be able to afford to eat for the rest of the week, thank you!"""
"We had one of those memorable experiences here which we have started to look forward to on our culinary trips. We walked to Girl & The Goat from Doubletree on Ohio and Fairbanks (a good couple of miles I think) on a bitterly cold December night and it as well worth it. We were seated right away, fabulous atmosphere, open kitchen, and we love it when we have to occasionally raise our voices to be heard over the table (I am not saying it was loud, it was just perfect for us). We got the ""Chicken Little"" bread (very good, a fat round loaf with chicken liver butter and carrot and sage oil), diver scallops (excellent, very fresh with lovely crispy garbanzos and and little bits of pork sausage in the sauce), goat empenadas (very good, we had to get something from the goat menu), Walter's chicken (least memorable and the reason for 4-stars, it is a heavy dish with chicken wings, yuzu harissa, fried pickles and grilled naan and it Â was easily the tamest amongst all the dishes and yet it filled us to the brim, the chicken skin could have been a little crispier) and roasted pig face (highlight of the night, beyond excellent, food-orgasmic excellent, fatty porky goodness with a sunny-side egg on top). We were so stuffed after a dessert that we decided to walk back on that bitterly cold December night."
"Wow just went here for my Bday. Â The food was out of this world. Â Had Chickpea fritters, crudo, duck stuffed shrimp, soft shell crab. Â And the most amazing dishes were the green beans and the sugo was incredible. Â Totally worth the wait. Â Our server was great too, her name was Marnie."
"Tuesday night, party of two, 530pm reservation.Excellent experience and fantastic food.The food (and, just the right amount for 2):Peter piper bread with fresh whipped fennel butter - fantastic...Roasted beet salad with avocado puree Â - 50/50 split...I did not love the fish elementChickpea fritters - amazing Â Skirt steak with warm salad greens - fantastic...tasted like butter melting in your mouthSummer flounder with figs and eggplant - also amazingFor dessert:Potato dumplings with honey yogurt, candied eggplants and figs. Â The dumplings were as light as beignets...like nothing you have ever had...The service was friendly and helpful, and we did not feel rushed. Â (That said, it was an early reservation...by the time we left, the place was packed, and, to echo other comments, it was pretty loud.) Â The best tip our waitress provided was to mix light plates with heavy ones (which is easy to do since the menu organization moves from light to heavy in descending order).We will return."
"Nice Decor, comfy seating, good vibe, but totally overated. I am completely amazed at the constant buzz as this place has one theme in my mind... FAT! Absolutely everything is covered with heavy unabashed oils and creams that would allow almost anyone to make dishes more tasty. They weren't hiding this point either as many dishes including the desserts started their description with the term Fat...of (something). A great dish to me, is infused with flavors that come from a balance of spice and fats, but doesn't have to derive it fully from the sauce as we experienced from the sliced (bland) lamb dish, covered in some (tasty) oil based sauce. The cod cheeks (fried) could have been great, but I couldn't tell them apart from the bed of shiny and oily potato chips that they were served over. What was called ravioli on the menu was actually Pappardelle wrapped around a tasty shredded pork and lamb and was good, but over salty. I guess from all the accolades, we Chicagoan's truly love our salt and fat and this is certainly a place to get it! Maybe keep a bowl of cholestoral pills & blood thinners, instead of breath mints by the exit though because you never know? Sorry G&G, not totally impressed."
"By far one of the best meals I've had in Chicago lately. Â While I've heard great things in the short time it's been open, I know that expectations aren't always met. Â I have to say that this time they were exceeded. To start we were seated on time by an incredibly personable hostess and the service was great. Â Even though the place was packed we never felt rushed. Â As for food, we couldn't stop eating the green beans even when other plates were put on our table. Â The clams were also a hit. I suggest only 2 plates per person if you want room for dessert, which we had to forego. Â Also, skip the bread if you don't want to fill up. The two downsides are noise (but what Chicago restaurant doesn't have a noise problem these days) and the overabundance of meat, even with vegetable options. I agree with others that if you're vegetarian it will be hard to find something you'll want to eat."
"We were very excited to eat At Girl and the Goat. Â The evening started out OK. Our table was waiting for our 7:45 reservation. The not Campbell's bread butter was good. Â Our experience went downhill after that. Â Everything we had was very salty. The table next to us was complaining about the salt as well. Â I had to stop eating the green beans because they were so salty. Â The service felt rushed. They make you order all your courses at one time. Â We told our wait person that we were fine with that as long as they didn't rush the courses. Â This is exactly what they did. As soon as we finished one course the next course was waiting for us. Â There was no down time. There was no savoring the flavors that you just finished. Â They wanted to turnover the table as quickly as possible. Â  Â We were in and out in a little over an hour with 6 courses,cocktails and dessert. Â We had even ordered white wine to go with a fish course. Â The wine came 2 courses after the fish course. Â The food that wasn't over salted was fine . Â Nothing top chef worthy."
"To LA people, Girl and The Goat is the Lazy Ox of Chicago. The highest of compliments I can bestow. Â Every bite made me want another. Â Their green beans are, as someone else aptly stated, like crack. The soft shell crab is worthy of ordering one for each diner. Â We ended the savory portion of the meal with a confit of goat, a dish so rich and decadent I almost didn't need dessert. We couldn't pass up a chance to try more at this charming restaurant so we ordered 2 desserts and 2 cheese plates. The strawberry spongecake with basil and lime curd was the standout. Perfectly cooling on the balmy Chicago heat wave night. Mid way through our meal my brother went to the hostess station to make reservations for a future meal. Perfectly timed, as though this was a tv episode, Chef Stephanie Â happened to be in the area, came over to my brother saying how great it is to hear the customer happy and eager to return. I may have to fly back to Chicago for our future reservations....in 3 months."
"i first went here 2 years ago and had a great experience but didn't really remember much about the food. Â we were only able to get a reservation at 10pm on a monday. Â really?! on a monday night? was expecting to walk into an empty restaurant and then get annoyed. however, we walked into a lively packed restaurant at 10pm! we had a great experience but the only downside was it was so loud we could barely hear each other talk. Â i don't know if the table was a bit big, the music was too loud, or a combination of everything. Â some of hte standout dishes- crudo with pork belly, broccoli, goat ribs, squab. however, the highllight of the meal, possibly my week was: smoked.duck.fat.butter. Â WOW. Â you have to ignore reading what it was. it's bad enough that you're eating butter but then you think about it: duck FAT. Â it makes you want to run 5 miles on the treadmill stat. or take an aspirin. Â but it is so delicious we ordered 2!!! Â you MUST try it. Â you won't regret it. the only excuse not to get it is if you're allergic to duck. but even then, it may be worth it to take an epi-pen to give yourself."
"I love this restaurant. Â She lives up to her title as top chef! Â Her menu is very creative, lots of great flavor combinations. I enjoyed every single dish we ordered and we had a party of 11 so we got to try quite a few dishes. Â Most notable for me were the roasted cauliflower, pig face with fried egg and sweet potatoes au gratin. Â It was hard to get a reservation but worth having dinner a little earlier in order to eat there."
This place just does not disappoint. Everything I've had each time I've been there has been fantastic. I can't wait to go back!
I thought the food selections were excellent with very different offering. The wine list was excellent and the service excellent as well. I am not a fan of small plates but they work well. So why didn't I like it? The food was way too salty and the only thing more over the top than the salt was the noise. If you speak sign language or read lips you are fine.
"This was the most disgusting meal I have ever seen. I did not eat any of it. The main course was either pig face or ribs. We decided to try both. I was completely repulsed by both. The pig face was ground up into two small patties, they contained so much fat and other unknown material, I could not touch it. The waiter lied about the ribs, he said it was similar to a half a slab, it was not. There were three small pieces of rib, mostly fat. This place is sick. My advice, don't go near it, there are too many other good places around Chicago, don't waste your time or money here."
I loved it. The food and service Â was great. I can't wait to get back!
"Went two weekends ago and my friend and I are still texting each other about it, claiming ""best meal of our lives"" and ""I would bathe my children in those green beans"". Â Was not overly excited this is where he chose for his birthday dinner, especially because we couldn't get a reservation until 10:45 and I am usually disappointed with restaurants that have received such hype. Â Walked in, dim lighting, good music playing, great martinis while we waited. Â Got there early around 10:15. Â Were seated by 10:30. Â Our waiter was outstanding, providing insight but not pushy. Â We ordered the green beans (GET THESE OR DIE UNHAPPY) and goat cheese tortellini and when they arrived, we sat in silence for 10 minutes, making gurgling noises like babies, unable to speak to each other because it was JUST THAT GOOD. Â Next came the empanadas and salmon. Â This is when I realized what they truly mean when they say eating is an experience. Â The salmon had fresh blueberries that burst in your mouth, crunchy pepitas for texture, and a chimichurri that they could not make as well in Argentina. Â Perfectly cooked, DIVINE. Â I mentioned to the waiter that it was my friend's birthday and they treated us to a goat cheese cheesecake that melted in our mouth, as we sipped our coffee and planned when he could come back from Seattle next to revisit the restaurant. Â I have never had my expectations so completely blown away. Â Our bill for the four courses plus two outstanding glasses of Pinot was $89. I would have paid $200. Will be back, again and again."
"I considered not even bothering with yet another review of G&G, but how can someone eat those chickpea fritters and not want to talk about them? Â I'll get back to the fritters though and start with the atmosphere. Â It's very urban, hip, lofty, artsy, and very crowded, as expected. Â You come through a large revolving door and there are cushioned benches with tables to the left, I suppose for walk ins or people that don't want to wait for a table (don't go without a reservation though). Â The space is huge with lots of dark wood and just a few pieces of accent art. Â Our reservation was at 8:45 and we were seated shortly thereafter. Â The restaurant is very crowded and loud, so if you're looking for something intimate, this won't work. Â It's a place to see and be seen and definitely made for groups of friends! Â Our server was great. Â She explained the regular menu and the specials of the night, suggested how much to order food-wise, and made some great beer suggestions. Â I really love how the menu is set up. Â 10 veg, 10 fish, 10 meat. Â All shared plates. Â There's something for everyone! Â You really need to be open minded with this menu as it's quite adventurous! Â Anyway, the server suggests we each choose 3 plates plus a bread. Â We each ended up choosing 2 plates plus a bread, and were completely stuffed upon leaving! Â So, we ordered the chickpea fritters, sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinagrette, lamb sausage stuffed calamari, and the short ribs. Â Everything is SUPER flavorful. Â I mean, wow. Â Nothing is subtle. Â The flavors are in your face and not for the faint of heart. Â We both kept saying how we could have continued to order the chickpea fritters and eat nothing else. Â They were that good. Â I think it's a must order dish when you go here. Â It was creamy, but crunchy, and salty and sweet, with a little kick of spice and just wow wow wow. Â Fried chickpeas? Â Give it to me. Â Hazelnut hummus? Â I must have it. Â Goat feta? Â I'll take it. Â Yeah, so, I'm going to be thinking about those fritters for a long time. Â Now, moving on to the other dishes. Â I won't go into much detail, but really everything is best for a group of 4. Â These are not small plates. Â Well, they are small plates, but they're pretty big small plates if you know what I mean. Â Everything was cooked perfectly. Â The ribs were fall off the bone, melt in your mouth yum, the green beans had a nice snap and crunch to them, the bread (oh the bread!) was crispy in the outside and soft in the middle - it was all just perfect. Â Everything was seasoned amazingly, but heavily. Â Like I said before, the flavors are really in your face. Â I can't possibly think of a single negative thing to say about Girl and the Goat. Â  It has got to be the best restaurant in the city right now. Â There's nothing better than having such delicious food in such a relaxed, fun, hip atmosphere. Â Anyway, no yelp review is going to do this place justice. Â You just need to go. Â Get to the Goat!"
make your reservation here NOW. Â it is delicious. Â small plates so make sure you are in the mood for that.
"Amazing food, atmosphere and by far service! So worth any amount of money...if ur thinking of spending dough at lawrys think twice and go to girl and the goat so u won't be disappointed! Love Stephanie Izard!!"
"Went back and since we had a large group, we got the goat leg (among other things). Freaking amazing."
"Stephanie Izard is a culinary superstar. Â We were seated at the community table, which was great because we got to preview our food before it came out. Â The service was great and the loft like feel went well with the food. Â The food was innovative, creative, and most of all delicious. Â Must eat in Chicago!"
"I literally just got home from the restaurant and I needed to tell the world how awesome this place is. Because Chicago is known for its restaurant scene, often many places that are deemed as the ""newest hot spot"" end up disappointing me. I am here for the food and if you give me good service, that's great too. I loved everything about GATG! Our server, Patrick, was so extremely nice and let me just say that my water never went below the half way mark! For starters we had he panfried shishito peppers with parmesean, sesame and miso (I hate peppers but absolutely loved these! They melted in your mouth!) and the sauteed green beans with fish sauce vinaigrette and cashews (BEST green beans I have EVER had! Salivating as we speak!). For our entrees we had the seared scallops with brown butter xo, goat sausage, shitake and winter squash (pure perfection) and the sauteed skate with goatbelly, maple-pink peppercoarn jus and fried egg (The skate and the goat belly were amazing! Everything went perfectly!). For dessert we had the blood orange sorbet and the bittersweet chocolate cake with shitake gelato (weiiirrdd... but ironically, it works!). All in all, get your butt to Girl and the Goat ASAP because it is too good to pass up! We're thinking about having my sisters 21st birthday here so we will definitely be back!!! :)"
"The food was great - no complaint at all on the food, but, the experience was disappointing. Â It's not cheap - but, don't think for one moment that you are there to enjoy your meal. Â  This is an assembly line operation and there are a lot of people there making sure that you are in and out and that the next party is sat quickly. Â It took a good 15 minutes before our server came to our table, but, once she showed up, she wanted us to order drinks and all of our plates at once. Â She told us that we should order our 8-10 plates for our party of 4 so that she could bring them in the proper order, but, that's not the reason. Â It's so that she didn't have to show up again, and so that they can put down 2 new plates each time you finish one. Â  If you want a second round of drinks you'll need to ask one of the bus boys as they set down your next round of plates. Â We ordered coffee and desserts, and we were given our check before we finished our coffee. Â Don't expect anyone to ask you if you want a refill on your coffee. Â As soon as my credit card was put down the host from the front desk came to process our check. Â We spent $300 and were certainly made to feel guilty that it took us 90 minutes. Â And as for the food, our group enjoyed the non-meat selections more than the meat selections. Â You have to try the pig face (jowls & tongue) just to say you tried it, but neither the pig face or pork shank ranked high on anyone's list from our group. Â I'm glad I tried this restaurant, but not sure that I'll need to try it again."
"By not going into details about every single thing we ate, I am doing this restaurant a grave injustice. Let me just say a few things. I know (because we had the best seats in the house, right up against the kitchen), that there is not a magical unicorn prancing around the kitchen bestowing ultimate savory perfection to every dish by a touch of its horn. But, had I not been sitting where I was, and you told me that, I would have believed you wholeheartedly. Every dish was awesome, and right when we thought ""Oh, it can't possibly get better than this,"" it did. We had bread with goat cheese butter. Fantastic. Pan fried duck tongues. Unbelievable. Grilled baby octopus. Fabulous. Goat Belly. Mind-blowing. Pan fried peppers. Amazing. Roasted cauliflower. How the f*** do you make cauliflower so f***ing good!? Skewered Lamb heart. Extraordinary. Aaaand Roasted Pig face. Orgasmic. Literally. This meal was like that ""I'll have what she's having"" scene. Except for real. Like, my legs were a bit shaky. There are not enough words in my lexicon to describe how good this experience was. From the moment we walked in the door to the moment we left, everything was perfect. There is so much more I want to rave about. The drinks, for example. I had one of the best manhattans I have ever had the pleasure of enjoying. ""But there must have been something wrong!"" you might say, ""the service, for example! Isn't that place like crazy busy, how can they have time to treat you right?"" To which I laugh, Ha-ha! Because the service was excellent as well. Some people don't realize that waiting tables is an art form all its own. But as a waitress myself, I recognize true talent, and this man had it. Oh yes. He could make a hell of a living teaching methodology. Anyway, long story short, by the end of this meal orgasms were achieved by all. I think it speaks for itself that the first thing I did when I got home, before calling my girl friend and telling her all the details, was go online and make a reservation to go back! Also, if the whole experience hadn't been so good, I probably would have returned home last night instead of this morning..."
besides feeling like i was in a fire place. the small plates were tastey. the 2 month wait for a reservation not sure was worth it.
"Well the day finally came. Â After a year of trying to get reservations my sisters and I went on Saturday to the Girl and the Goat Â at an odd hour at 4:45. Â I guess Girl and the Goat was trying to get hold of me that day to confirm my reservation and they left a message saying that they were going to release my reservation. Â What??? Â I called back right away and they said I called back just in time because they were about to release my reservation. Â So we get there and we ordered the cauliflower and green beans which the cauliflower was good, the green beans were o.k. Â We ordered the pork ribs and they were salty. The scallops were o.k.. Â There was really nothing that I was like WOW I want more of this or I want to come back and try other dishes. Â  Â I think this place is overated and after being so excited to try this place, it was such a let down. Â . Â There are so many other great restaurants out there that I would rather go to such as GT Fish and Oyster, Belly Shack, National 27, Cantina Laredo, Marcello."
"In a word - fantastic! Â It exceeded my expectations and I had set the bar pretty high. Â I was in Chicago for a few days and did a shout out to some foody friends asking for dining recommendations. Â Fortunately I was able to snag an early Friday eve reservation with only a two day notice. Â What luck! The menu was innovative and broad. Â The waitress recommended that my boyfriend and I order a number of ""small"" plates which, by the way, weren't small. Â We ordered way too much food but it was all so amazing that I glad we did. Â My favorites were Â the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts and mint; broccoli bread with creamy mushroom ""souplike"" butter and tomato ""souplike"" oil dipping sauce; the skirt steak with pickled beets and a goat cheese carmel sauce (sounds strange but it was amazing!); and the goat, veal, and pork sugo. Â My mouth is watering as I write this. Â My boyfriend loved the scallops with pumpkin, pomegrante, brussels sprouts. Â We also had the frites (cooked in pig fat or bacon grease I think). Â They were good though perhaps a bit too salty. Â I seriously think I felt my arteries hardening on the spot. Â The only thing that fell a bit short from our perspective was desert, an apple parfait of sorts with bourbon cream. Â It was good but not over the top like everything else we had. Â  The service was attentive but not too pushy. Â We lingered for several hours on a busy Friday night but no one hovered over our tables to hurry us out the door. Â Our waitress also recommended a good, reasonably priced wine as well. Â My only criticism is the restaurant is in Chicago and not in San Francisco where I live :-) Â When I'm in Chicago next, I'll be back."
Believe the hype! Â This place is worth the 3 month wait. Â Make your reservation now. Â Every dish was amazing. You must try the cauliflower side...Spectactular! Â Service was casual and friendly. Â Server was very helpful. Â We were a Â party of 4 women and ordered 6 dishes which was plenty. We were very lucky and were seated at the Chef's Table. Stephanie came out and took pictures with us which was thoughtful. Â Loved it and am looking forward to going back with my honey.
"I was lucky enough to go twice with different people in the past 2 weeks. I'll just talk about the food. Very unimpressed with the bread (first one on the menu). It was honestly like table bread that you normally get free with dinner. Didn't get it the second time. The table next to us the second time got a different bread and that actually looked pretty good. Also skipped the octopus and the cauliflower the second time. They're not bad, I don't really like octopus and both were more salty than really flavorful. Pig face is awesome and got that both times and was my favorite of all of the dishes we tried. The green beans are excellent and must have as was the hiramasa crudo. The ribs just a slight notch down from those two, not because the taste wasn't great but moreso because you can get good ribs at other places. Chickpea fritters and goat neck were both very good but fall just short of must have. The goat neck does have a ton of meat. Ham Frites is good but it's basically bacon flavored french fries. We got the creme brulee both times for dessert and I'd say they're pretty good but again, not must have."
"Like everyone, I was expecting great things from Girl & the Goat. Â It lived up to my expectations. Â When we arrived at our 8:30 reservation, we were seated almost immediately. Â We started off with cocktails and deep fried oysters topped with egg salad. Â Seriously--so yummy!!! Â The food is tapas style so we ordered 4 dishes (for 2 people): a sushi type dish, lamb shank, peppers and ham frites. Â Everything was fantastic but the lamb shank was amazing. Â Stephanie serves it with nan, a curry sauce, onion/grape topping and get this...sliced hard boiled egg!!! Â The egg was my favorite topping. Â The lamb was so rich and melted in my mouth. Â We finished dinner with two amazing desserts. Â  Each dish is incredibly rich so be prepared! Â And my favorite part is how the food and environment is not intimidating....it just felt comfortable...busy, but comfortable! All in all, I'd go back to Girl and a Goat over and over again. Â Although, it's a bit pricey (~$100pp with drinks) so maybe more of a special occasion place. Â Enjoy!"
"went here for a girls' night with 3 other besties. Â have been looking forward to this dining event since the opening and it did not disappoint. Â we had 10:45p resos, but got there early and got seated early. Â we got lucky and had seats towards the back and had a perfect view of the kitchen. Â the decor of the place was so comfortable, i felt like i was in someone's dining room. Â there are 2 large tables at the back that seat 8....one of these days i'm going to get a large party to sit there b/c it just seems so much fun. Â we got to see stephanie working the entire night. Â definitely got starstruck when she stopped by our table to say hi and take pictures with us. Â i felt bad b/c we had 3 different cameras, but she was awesome and patient. Â the staff was wonderful and friendly. Â our server was meadows who was so fun and personable. Â watch out for michael who likes to sneak in all your pictures (it's really funny actually) and it helps that he is super cute, so it's actually a nice addition to your pics! Â the food speaks for itself...it's an eclectic menu but very tasty and reasonably priced. Â for the 4 of us plus a drink, we spent $57 each including tip, and that's for 2 breads, 1 app, 2 fish dishes, 3 meat dishes, and 2 desserts and 4 coffees. Â not a bad deal for that caliber of a restaurant. Â i cannot wait to go back and sit at the back table. Â hopefully meadows will still be working there and michael to help spice our pictures up."
"I went the second week after it opened and found the food mediocre. Some of the dishes were too salty and the oysters were not flavorful. Â Since the menu consists of inventive dishes like pig face which was halfway decent and the decor and service were nice, I wouldn't count it out. But one shouldn't go out of their way for it either."
"This may be the most overhyped and underwhelming meal I have ever had. Â My husband and I travel for a living and eat almost every meal in restaurants and we have never written a review either negative or positive before, but Â this meal was such a waste that we felt compelled to write this review to advise people not to waste their time and money. The food is totally unbalanced and super salty, and I LOVE salt. The mushroom ragout was so repulsive that we had to send it back, we have never sent anything back before that wasn't under or overcooked. The restaurant is loud and the staff are not casual, but totally unprofessional. Our waitress didn't really know the menu well and instead of saying I'm going to find out, I'll be right back just made things up. Also, if the only res you can give people is at 10:45 then don't rush them out the door at midnight after they've dropped $200 dollars. The check was dropped along with the dessert without even asking if we wanted anything else, which we did by the way. And as we were finishing our dinner and several other patrons were still at the bar the bartender hopped up on the bar and started clearing all the bottles off shelves and wiping them and the shelves down in a clear sign of get the F out. Â Our advice would be to spend you money at one of Chicago's truly special restaurants like Publican or Longman and Eagle."
"Finally, I got a reservation! Â We got a nice quiet table, which was very welcomed given the noise level in the restaurant! Â Some of our favorites were the warm bread, shishito peppers, and fried oysters! Â Very tasty! Â The 5 plate recommendation was a lot of food for 2 people, but we were more then happy to taste everything! We finished with the malasadas, which we were recently introduced to on Hawaii, and they were delicious!"
"Of course this place is great. A menu full of unexpected combinations and very pleasant surprises, dishes that are served ways you'd never think of but are so so glad someone else did. So I'll just list the dishes our table had on 7/28/11 and tell how the group netted out on them. One complaint-the waiter forgot to bring two of our dishes, but made up for it with free stuff.Bloody Mary Bread & Butter: I loved it, no one else did. Not for everyone.Squash Blossom Rangoon: sweet & savory, light & crispy. A favorite. Roasted Cauliflower: The slightly charred cauliflower and vinegary dressing are great together. Managed to get a hesitant table excited for cauliflower.Soft Shell Crab: like the best crab & corn chowder ever but not soup.Goat Empanada: good but not good enough to stand out here.Goat Confit: buttery sweet lobster and crispy fat goat belly. Worth the gout it'll give ya.Scallops and Smoked Goat: the crowdpleasing, group favorite.Pork Fat Donuts: Zucchini in a dessert? No one at our table much cared for this one. The one time all night having my expectations subverted did not pay off. Goat Cheese Bavarois: Very tasty, an excellent savory dessert. As for drinks: we tried a couple cocktails. I was told the Ash Smash, which comes with Mezcal, would be smokey, but it tasted more like an average margarita to me. The real standout was the Allagash Victor Ale, a high alcohol beer brewed with grapes. Delicious and easily quaffable."
"The food is very good here. Â We tried a little bit of everything and also ordered the goat leg for our table of 7. Â Everyone liked the goat leg, including my sister who doesn't normally like goat. Â The only negative is the restaurant does get smoky from the grill. Â The bill was reasonable and the service was great. Â Not pretentious at all. Casual environment. Â It was more about the food rather than the fluff."
"my hubby took me to our local fav spacca napoli for the actual weeknight of my birthday since it's not too far from where we live & we know we can get an excellent meal in a casual atmosphere for a reasonable price for higher quality & somewhat pricier food. Â for my surprise dinner the friday after my thursday bday, he took me to ""girl and the goat."" Â (he knows i'm a stephanie izard fan & he even took me to a cook off a couple of years ago between izard & the chef at the drawing room inside of le passage. Â i met stephanie then & told her that she should have won the cook off which was done in a head to head style...but i digress.)we arrived for our rather early 5:15pm reservation--even by booking a couple months in advance that was the best time we could get--i was immediately taken with the interior. Â a variety of seating options--lounge seats w/ low tables, bar service, communal tables & private tables abound. Â the dark almost cabin-like wood interior is accented by punches of graphic art & modern lighting hanging from the ceiling. Â the bar wall includes vintage fireplace grates to show off the bottles. Â the high ceiling of the whole space creates an open feel. Â needless to say i really liked the interior. Â it was classy, but had a really casual and cozy feeling. Â other reviews say that it was loud & because of where we sat (will explain soon), i cannot entirely speak to that, but stephanie clearly is not trying to create an L20/Spiaggia atmosphere. Â she wants people to laugh, talk, booze & keep eating in a comfortable space. Â the staff is incredibly friendly. Â we were thanked for coming by hostesses & waitresses who had not served us at all when we left! Â i'm not sure if my hubby had said in our reservation that this was a birthday dinner, but we were seated at a two person butcher block ""table"" w/ highboy chairs at the far right end of the kitchen line. Â we were introduced to the 4 nearest line cooks by our super friendly server. Â the line cooks took the time to answer any questions we had, recommended their favorite dishes & otherwise engaged in banter w/ us when we were all in the mood. Â the cooks were young, tattooed & universally friendly.our server asked us if we had dined there before, we hadn't, walked us through the entirely tasting plates menu, gave us a few highlights, asked us what items we were thinking about, gave his 2 cents politely & took our order. Â my hubby started w/ a really excellent old fashioned & i with glass of excellent cab. Â we ordered essentially in 3 rounds--they recommend that each person order 2 to 3 dishes, but i will say that the serving sizes vary so it would be a good idea to ask your server how large a particular dish is. Â being seated in the kitchen, we could often see for ourselves how large each dish was.in our first round we ordered:1. warm corny goat bread served w/ whipped goat cheese & corn relish2. crispy, fresh sauteed green beans w/ fish sauce vinaigrette & cashews3. the goat belly terrine w/ fried lentils & nectarine tapenade4. seared scallops w/ pumpkin puree & charred brussel sproutsmy hubby liked the terrine even though he's afraid of some fancy dishes. Â the fried lentils on top added an amazing crunch to the tender chilled goat belly. Â we agreed that the green beans were our favorite dish of the night. Â the sauce was salty but complemented the fresh beans perfectly. Â the scallop dish was not my favorite but was perfectly cooked--who doesn't love a good brussel sprout?our second round was:5. the chickpeas fritters w/ heirloom tomatoes & fresh mozzarella6. goat, pork and veal sugo w/ pappardelle, rosemary & cape goose berrieseven though we chose some of the dishes that were not the largest ones so that we could have more room to try things, by the time we were digging into the second round + our 2nd or 3rd drinks, we were getting full. Â the fritters were rich & decadent--like a creamy falafel w/ the best little caprese salad. Â the sugo was also rich, buttery & the berries added a really bright, unique tart twist. Â somehow, i think w/ a little breathing room conversation & back rubbing (yes, but in a really nice way) from our waiter, we made room for one dessert. Â we shared the blueberry compote, brown sugar cake topped w/ caramelized goat cheese cream & crispy granola served in a small, but tall ramekin. Â we followed instructions & made sure we dipped our spoons all the way to the bottom to get perfect bites. Â this dessert was not too sweet, was incredibly delicious & texturally balanced. Â i will agree with other reviewers that stephanie's menu is overall pretty rich & many dishes utilize fatty meats, butter & salt, but if you're careful when you order, you will not feel stuffed. Â everything was delicious. Â next time, i think we're going to just go to sit at the bar, get a drink & order to the grilled octopus (which looked incredibly fresh) & the potato dumplings for dessert. Â can't wait! Â kudos stephanie!"
"Of course the food is excellent, but I also think it has a great atmosphere. It's a lot of fun...not stuffy or cold like some other foodie destinations."
"Sat at the not-quite full bar to eat while in town on business. Â Called ahead and showed up at 4:45 so I could walk-in according to their instruction. Vibe=we're doing you a favor letting you eat here. Ordered some good oysters and the smoked goat pizza which the bartender talked me out of and suggested the chickpea fritters instead. Tasty and flavorful and really greasy, but why not just let me order goat in a restaurant named for one. I think he thought it would take too long for me to eat. Wanted dessert - really creative sounding dishes for only $8 - but felt rushed and unwelcome to take up a seat at the bar. Â Paid up and was out the door by 5:10. Disappointed in the attitude."
"Ive been here three times now and must say this is one of the best meals I have had my entire life. Â EVERYTHING...literally EVERTYHING is excellent. Â This place is simply the best...creative, tasty, reasonably priced, great service. Â This is the stuff dreams are made of!!! Â Its official...best meal I have had my entire life. Â Thank so much Stephanie for opening up this frantastic restaurant."
"whoa. this place is special.fresh baked wheat bread - w/ banana, peanut butter butter.chickpea fritters - was expecting something similar to falafel but this was much more complex. hazelnut hummus. this thing just exploded with flavor.griller artichoke - small but delicious dish. it was only half of a small artichoke, i would of like the whole thing. but it had a great mozzarella cheese and tons of different tastes. squash ravioli - this was the veggie dish the waiter recommended. it was also excellent, very very hearty with the mushrooms and ragout.chocolate cake - w/ shitake gelato - the cake had an crunchy texture to it. almost oreo like. with a shitake gelato that was so odd by itself yet with the chocolate it was perfect. happy juice - told the waiter i didnt drink and he brought me a red drink that had a raspberry/cucumber taste, it was delicious and recommended if you want something more then water.this place is amazing. sure you have to make a reservation months in advance. but its a beautiful restaurant with an open kitchen and a great staff. one of the better restaurants i've ever been too."
"I was hesitant about this restaurant, I don't normally eat anything outside of my very specific comfort zone. Â That being said, I thought the Girl & The Goat was fantastic. Â There is something on the menu for everyone as long as you are willing to try new things. Â All of the vegetarian options were excellent, the squash blossom rangoons are a must-try."
"I just had an extremely positive experience at Girl and the Goat. Â For starters, I was stuck on the expressway and was 1/2 hour late to meet my friend for our 6:30 reservation. Â When I finally arrived at 7:00 they had held our table and were so nice about it. Â The staff is very nice and very competent. Â Each person we came in contact with was friendly and without any stuffiness as I have encountered at some restaurants. Â Everything we ordered was delicious. Â I was reluctant to come because I was afraid I wouldn't like the menu, even though I was attracted to the hipness of the restaurant. Â There are plenty of things to order if you don't want goat or pig face. Â We each had a cocktail and we shared an appetizer and the bread. Â We ordered three things and they were all outstanding. Â We then shared a dessert and had coffee. Â The total bill was $98 which I think is very reasonable for a place this good. Â I highly recommend coming here!! Â 5 for Circuses and 5 for Bread!"
"Dropped in for beers and snacks about 5 pm. Â No wait for the bar, though it filled up rapidly after that. Â I can't comment on their wines but try Avery's beers (had both, excellent). Â Service was swift, attentive, helpful with selections. Two parting words- pork shank!"
"Well I have no idea what restaurant those sour grapes complainers ate at. Â This was pretty close to perfect (although the confit goat belly with crab and lobster was a tad too rich for my taste) ... unlike many other top restaurants we've eaten at, nothing was too salty, the flavors melded perfectly. Â My favorites, the pig face and the goat cheese bavarois dessert ... We can't wait to go back and try different things."
"Yummmmmm. Hate to pile onto the already great reviews but this place is good, really good. Went for drinks and snacks at the bar and ended up getting the communal table near the kitchen. Not only had we not reserved but we got to watch the amazing cooks do their thing. Â We had the chickpea fritters which have a memorable Mediterranean taste, the calamari stuffed with lamb which was so tender you thought you were eating dumplings, ribs which were tasty Â and the goat masala pizza. The flavors on the goat pizza were memorable and I am still craving the mix. Â We also had the bread which came with a savory beer cheese. Dessert was the divine blood orange sorbet with an amazing parsnip pot-du creme and the bourbon apples. The small plate allow you to share and everything was well spiced. A bit out of the ordinary which is why I think I liked it. Cannot wait to go back and try everything we missed."
"We had a great experience. The food and the service were top notch. 2 of us shared the gjetost pancakes, squash blossom rangoon, sauteed green beans, Â seared scallops, and the goat loin. We both left very happy cutomers. My only crtique was that the restaurant is very noisy."
"I really wanted to like this place. Â Interesting menu, great service, but...the food just doesn't deliver. Â We tried five dishes (shishito peppers, pig face, goat pizza, etc.) - not one that came close to hitting the mark. Â Not even a flavor within a dish that my wife or I found interesting. Â I'm confused by the reviews that comment that the food was too salty, dishes were hit and miss - and still give four stars. Â Trendy place without the food to back up the hype."
worth the hype. Â simply great. Â will return and continue to show up sans reservations for some fun bar action.
"I was pretty displeased with Girl and the Goat. Being a huge Food Network fan and a pridefull Chicago Guy, I was delighted to see a Chicago native win top honors and follow that up with a new restaurant in the heart of Chicago's restaurant scene on Randolph. I have now been there 2x with a total of 3 others and have tried about 10 of their dishes. They marvel about their vegetable dishes like their Green Beans and Cauliflour but really, they are just vegetable dishes. All the dishes are pleasant on the palet as one would expect with any fine dining experience, however, only 2 or 3 of those really excited me. The rest were good, but nothing extraordinary considering the calibur of the restaurant. Stephanie, the owner/operator was ""too busy"" to stop by our table when requested which was uncharacteristic of a nice restaurant. Most chefs/owners are delighted to meet their guests. The host section had about 4 employees but tables sat cleaned and ready to be used for an average of 20 min. There was a long wait list and at one point I counted 5 tables all open at the same time- and they were open for a while! Staff was more or less friendly but friendly does not make for poor skill settings. Unfortunately, my particular server was not anything special. I sat at the ""Chefs table"" or whatever you call it right in front of the kitchen. I had a chance to observe the Chefs at work which was pretty cool. I did notice that one chef did almost nothing the entire time but that does not conceern me. Overall, it is still a hot spot with plenty of guests which makes it still a place that is fun to be at. Food is very good but no where near great. Staff is poorly trained but still pleasant. There are much much better places to try in Chicago. If you do not get to dine out a lot, don't waste your time. If your lucky enough to eat out often, put this place on your list but lower your expectations from some of the strong reviews."
"I took my wife here for her birthday last night. I made the reservation months out and still couldn't get in before 9. Â Thankfully, they were able to seat us 10 minutes early. The atmosphere is nice. It's a bit loud, but what do you expect for a place this popular? Now to the food. Â Everything on the menu is strange. But, we loved everything we ate. We had the chickpea fritters, which my wife absolutely loved. Â I liked them as well, but they didn't knock me out. Now the goat belly with lobster and crab - that DID knock me out. Â The portion (like all of their portions) was small, but I couldn't eat it all because it was so rich. Â That was also the case with every dish. Â Everything was so incredibly rich that I felt like I needed to go outside and smoke a cigar after each portion. We also had the green beans, which had a fish sauce on them. They were stinky, but really tasty. Â We also had the Pig Face. Â It was interesting. We couldn't finish it so we brought it home and I finished it today. Â Yum! My wife had a cocktail with Pimm's in it and she said it was the best drink she has ever had. Â The highlight of the evening (besides Stephanie coming to our table to check on us!) was the dessert. We had some kind of goat cheese bavarian cream with a cookie and some blueberries. Â Amazing! As others have noted, be prepared to drink a gallon of water - the food is well-seasoned and incredibly rich. Â Also, if you go, go with another couple at least, that way you can try more items on the menu. Â Before the tip, our total was under $100, which I considered to be a pretty good bargain for food of this quality."
"meal was great. but what caught my attention was the pork fat donut. it was like one of those everlasting gobstoppers from wonka...first it was the taste of the fat it was fried in, then the kick of spiciness, then the sweet dough and finally the pineapple garnish."
one of the best small plate restaurants i i have been to. Â this and the purple pig are my favorites.
"I usually don't write reviews of places that I only go to once, but due to the obvious popularity of Girl & the Goat, combined with my lack of planning to make a reservation 2 months in advance and my aversion to simply trying my luck at the bar when I'm hungry, I probably won't go here again in the near future. But if you're so lucky to go here once (or more), do yourself a favor and get the blood orange sorbet. I have dreams about that stuff (second best to the corn dessert that I'm still lusting over at Sprout). And yes, be daring and try the lamb heart - it's crisp and chewy, but not rubbery, it's salty and sweet with the strawberries, and it doesn't have any of the mineraly undertones that you'd expect from eating an organ. The pig face was good, but in comparison to everything else I had, just ok (for the record, everything else was freaking fantastic - asparagus, crudo, and goat belly, all shared with my husband). All in all, to sum it up, yes, it does live up to the hype, yes, I'm convinced that Stephanie Izard deservedly won Top Chef, and yes, I would love to go here again, provided I get better at planning."
"this is my new favorite restaurant in chicago! i went with my coworkers and there was 9 of us. they sat us a great table right near the kitchen. we were so happy that there was a lot of us because then we were able to try so much! everything we ordered was delicious. i loved everything. some of the food items we got were: green beans, chickpea fritters, scallops, oysters, escargot ravioli, cauliflower, and goat empanadas! i never had goat before and i loved the empanadas. they were great! i can't wait to go back....if i can get another reservation :)"
"Awesome Awesome food, everything on the menu was perfect. Especially lamb empanadas and chick-peas fritters"
"Went there on a random, cold Monday night in April. Had a reservation for 9:15 but got there a little early, planning to grab a drink at the bar. When we got there the place was packed!! And this place isn't a small 20 seat place either. Space is huge and fun. Industrial. Open kitchen spans the whole back wall. Fun watching the chefs on the line. Great local beer list. Got seated a little early and the fun began. I'll just say this: best meal period. Our server was fun and very knowledgable. She helped us navigate the menu and we settled on 7 dishes for the two of us. It was the perfect amount of food for us. So many standouts: green beans, chickpea fritters, pig face, goat chorizo flatbread, hiramasa crudo. My favorite was the lamb tartar with english peas. Love the seasonality of the menu (the flatbread came with a ramp vinaigrette). Dessert was great. Had the buttermilk pannacotta with rhubarb, lemon, and graham crackers. I see why Chicagoans wait 2 hours for a table. Definitely try to grab a reservations, even if you have to end up eating dinner at 4:30 or 11:00. Well worth it."
Totally worth the trip downtown to check this concept out. Really yummy and put together! I can't say enough about this place.
"A group of friends and I went and we were excited with all the hype. The food was AMAZING, honestly its a simple idea of having a twist on the traditional tapas, but the quality of the ingredients is definitely noticeable. We had potatoes au gratin, chickpea fritters, goat chorizo flatbread, wood oven roasted pig face, and the blood orange gelato. Everything was great and we were able to find food for the non-beef eaters and the carnivores alike. I'd recommend checking it out at least once, just be sure to plan ahead as reservations are hard to get."
"I'd say that my evening at Girl and Goat hovered between a 5 and a 3, hence the 4 stars :-)Was super excited to come here since i LOVE TOP CHEF! and somehow managed to miss izard's secret dinners. Scored a reservation Thursday night and checked it ou with 3 girlfriends.The first half of our dishes were outstanding. The second half were just okay. In order of deliciousness:1) green beans and cashews: my girlfriends and i have totally different tastes and we all agreed that this dish was outstanding! it really did renew my faith in chicago dining. flavors were fresh, but strong and somewhat unexpected 2) soft shell crab. i love anything deep fried and anything made of corn so this was the dish for me! i loved how the lime just set this dish off, it was delicious3) chickpeas: our group was a little more split on this dish. i loved the difference chickpea textures and the acidity of the grape tomatoes. 4) skate: the calamari was DELICIOUS, but the fish was a tad over-salted for my taste. overall the dish had too delicate of a flavor for me, our expectations had been set by the green beans5) cauliflower: while the cauliflower had a nice charred appearance, some pieces were overcooked and the smokiness wasn't distributed throughout; the more we ate the dish, the more we discovered (lime, mint) which leads me to think it could have been mixed more6) rabbit: i did not have the rabbit since i'm not a carnivore :-) but my girlfriends were not impressed. they said it tasted like bad chicken which is never a good thing.So while we had some excellent and some mediocre dishes overall am excited to visit again!!!!!!!! our server shared that izard will change the menu often so am excited to see what she concocts, as long as she keeps the green beans and soft shell crab!!"
"I went here for my birthday. We had the scallops, pig face, rabbit rilette, lamb ribs, flounder, goat pizza, kohlrabi, soft shell crab, blueberry goat cheese, and potato doughnuts. Scallops were cooked perfectly and the veal with the dish was ok. I did not like the pig face and my friend said it's better to eat the face off of a roasted pig because it was more tende and flavorful than this dish. I found the rabbit rilette really oily. I found the lamb ribs ok and tender but not flavorful. The goat pizza was ok but the crust wasn't that flavorful and I thought needed more salt. Kohlrabi salad was ok. The soft shell crab was amazing and we ended up ordering 2 of them. The corn and the potatoes that went with this dish were amazing. The flounder was also really good. We felt the fish dishes were the strongest. The blueberry goat cheese dessert was more savory and was almost like a goat cheesecake. The potatoe doughnuts were amazing and the sauce complement the dish with the figs. I wanted to lick the plate. Staff was really nice and it was extremely busy for a Tuesday night."
"Overall wonderful! We were seated at one of the two tables that are on the line in the kitchen so we were ""wowed"" from the moment we sat down. We ordered: Warm marinated olives, grilled baby octopus, fried brussel sprouts, goat pork and veal sugo, pork meatballs with escargot in the middle, pig face and the miso hungry bread. I highly recommend the octopus, sugo, bread, and pig face. It was great! We got to meet Stephanie who was extremely kind. I think meeting the chef and sitting in the kitchen were extras to what was already an amazing dinner. I could have sat in the corner and it would have been just as wonderful. Make reservations now, but prepare for a long wait to get in at a ""normal"" time for dinner. Bravo!"
"I had such a positive dining experience at the Girl and the Goat.To be fair, I won the foodie lottery and the host seated me and my dining companion at one of the two tables that look into the kitchen. Â SO COOL. Â We were a few feet from Chef Izard and got to chat with two of the sous-chefs (not a super busy night).Our server was gregarious and knowledgeable. Â Although I know some who may have felt that he came on too strong, I thought his suggestions really helped our meal. Â He took a really personal approach to the menu and seemed very invested in the restaurant and our dining experience.The food was great. Â We did not have a bad item, and my only complaint is that I couldn't have tried more plates. Â Overall, with one of the artisan breads, five plates, two desserts, two beers, a cocktail, a glass of wine, and a very generous tip, our total for two was only $160. Â This place is a steal.And for the nerds (like me) out there, our menu:-The bread with roasted garlic and anchovy butter. Â As a garlic and salt nut, I honestly think it's what they serve in heaven.-Pork liver mousseline with pickled cauliflower, cherry mustarda, crumpets and pickles. Â YUM. Â My first experience with any kind of pate, and it was so creamy and rich. Â I liked the other components on the plate, although sometimes I felt that the acid of the mustarda and pickled items could overwhelm the delicate pate.-Hiramasa crudo with caperberries, pork belly, and ahi aioli. Â My favorite. Â So balanced.-Triggerfish with cripy potatoes, plums, and some other things that I now cannot recall. Â The plums were perfect with the creamy sauce that accompanied the fish.-Black olive mezzalune with leeks, summer squash, and harissa. Â Also quite tasty, although to me it got lost in the crowd.-Rabbit rilettes with crisp rice crepes, ginger giardinaire, and sweet garlic. Â A great end to the entree portion of our meal. Â So perfectly savory. Â The texture of the rilette was exquisite, and it sopped up the extra sauce so deliciously.Dessert:-Goat cheese bavaroise with blueberries and brown sugar cake. Â Very good, although it was out-shined by our second dessert,-Fudgecicle with dragon's milk stout. Â Definitely not for everyone, but I thought that this dessert was innovative, challenging, and delicious. Â It was definitely a highlight for me.Eat at Girl and the Goat. Â The ambiance, service, food, and price make it a must try for all of Chicago."
"I was super excited to finally be able to try out this place ever since it first opened a few months back. I heard only amazing things about it from everyone. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed. I think only because I just expected to be blown away which I was not. Most of the dishes we had were very good, like the seared scallops and chickpea fritters but quite honestly was not amazing like so many have claimed. Other dishes were okay like the pig face, and a few I just did not like at all like the pan fried shishito peppers. The cocktail I had was good (unfortunately I can't remember what it was). The wait staff are great, fun, knowledgeable and attentive. Overall it is a great place and definitely worth trying and honestly my 3 star rating is only because of all the hype, if I had gone not knowing about it I would have definitely given it at least 4 if not 5 stars....sorry. I will try to give it a second go and might change my Â rating later...."
"Food is very different which is what makes it such a great find! Pigs face, goat mousse, truffle ice cream, etc. We ordered 4 dishes and all were delicious. The only thing we did not love was dessert. Mushroom based ice cream was a bit too earthy for us. The Pig face melts in your mouth and the breads were a perfect addition to the meal. Great wine list and we actually were able to get a table as a walk in with only a 20 minute wait. The ambiance was very hip yet comfortable. We had a wonderful waitress that was fun, but informative. The only reason we did not give it a 5 is that the night before we ate at Sable and that was our favorite."
"its not often that a trendy place like girl and the goat lives up to the hype--especially when it's such a big room--but our dinner there last week was really great. Â A couple of highlights--roasted oysters with a little horseradish, outstanding. Â chickpeas four ways were an interestng combo of flavors and. yes, chickpeas. Â the lamb shank was probably our favorite--looked like something fred flinstone would appreciate. Â served with homemade pita, onions, a couple of sauces--basically make your own gyro. Â dont let the difficulty of getting a reservation stop you--we walked in and stalked a couple of people at the bar until they sucked down their drinks and left. Â full menu at the bar and good bartenders. Â highlight was the bartender shared our hatred of cilantro-so steered us clear of this evil weed. Â worth going."
"A taste bud explosion!!!! The food here is very creative and the atmosphere is great. Our meal was better than anything we have had thus far in San Francisco or Napa (hundreds of restaurants). Â Would love it if Stephanie could recreate this out West. If you get a chance, sit at the table for two located right in front of the kitchen. The chefs there are awesome and you really get a good sense of what goes into preparing this great food."
"3.5. I really want to give it a 4 because it is beautiful, trendy, has a Top Chef and is the latest and the greatest... but I couldn't. Don't get me wrong, the food is good and so is the atmosphere, but I think it could be so much better. Love their creative menu and love the small plates so you can share. The food was flavorful and unique, but just a tad on the salty side. We ordered the elvis bread, cauliflower, the green beans, the pig's face and the scallops. That was more than enough food and quite satisfying but not amazing as I was expected. But at the same time, I probably have higher expectations since it is a Top Chef restaurant. My favorite was probably the scallops and then the cauliflower a close second. The pig's face was just ok (the server really talked it up so we had to try it) and the green beans, too. I do complement the service, the server, the decor and the menu. Would definitely go back there and try some other things. I want Stephanie Izard to knock my socks off with a 5 star rating! Hopefully I won't have to wait another month or so for a weekend reservation, although that is doubtful."
"The Girl & The Goat completely lives up to the hype! Â My boyfriend and I had one of the best meals we've ever eaten. Â We ordered Chickpea Fritters which, when consumed with the rest of the items on the plate, created little flavor explosions in my mouth. Â The Squash Blossom Rangoon was to die for and made the most amazing start to the meal. Â The Beef Tongue was very tasty, however, I am still curious about the Lamb Heart which we originally ordered but they were out of. Â The Pig Face was truly amazing, each bite was fantastic! Â Add the Mr. Potato Bread with potato aioli (the best aioli sauce I've ever tasted) and leek butter and you have one fabulous dinner. Â My boyfriend and I were so pleased, especially when the check came - it was a great value for what you get. Â The bill came out to $90 (and that's with 2 glasses of wine and 2 beers). Â I've easily spent that much at mediocre restaurants... It is clear that GATG really knows food - not only was the taste unbelievable, the care they took in the order and timing of each dish and the considerations of the waitstaff was excellent. Â If you live in Chicago and haven't been to the Girl & The Goat yet, you really should. Â You will not be disappointed."
"Tell your friends, bring your family and go back often. Outstanding flavors, polite service, cool dining room, neat view of the kitchen and pretty presentation! Â There were six of us dining at Girl and The Goat on a Thursday at 5:30pm and I was shocked that the place was packed. Who knew people in the city went out to eat this early? Â  Our friendly server told us that for a group of 6 we should share between 12-15 dishes and she was spot on. Â  Might I also mentioned that I was pleasantly surprised when the waitress asked if there were any dietary restrictions? She even knew what a Pescatarian was. Gold star!!!! We had so much fun trying all the powerful plates of food. Â By far, my favorite dish that was passed around was the sauteed green beans tossed with a saucy vinaigrette. Seriously crazy how excited one can be about a vegetable. But please, do yourself justice and order one or two servings of this for a large group. Â Another noteworthy veggie dishes include the roasted cauliflower with pine nuts and mint. Any sweet potato lovers out there? If so, you must order the sweet potato gratin. They top it with tasty,crispy onions. For seafood, the skate and octopus also wowed with intensity. We also shared the bread and variety butter, which was good also. As a recent found admirer of oysters, I was happy to experience the horseradish aioli oyster. It was delicious with just the right hint of horseradish. To finish the night we ordered the creamy, delicious chocolate dessert, which was amazing. Â I cannot say enough good things about this place. Â Fantastic food, gorgeous presentation, crazy combinations of flavors and really prompt service. Â  Â You'll be surprised that they do take walk ins, but go early and be prepared to enjoy a beverage at the bar first. Â Your taste buds will thank you for going to Girl and The Goat and enjoying the talent of Chef Stephanie Izard ."
A-mazing. I will go back every trip to Chicago. Highlights are roasted califlower and chickpea fritters.
"We went during the blizzard... Â And the staff, food, and overall experience could not have been better. Â Thunder snow and lightning just added to the fun. The food was wonderful, our waiter was fantastic, and I thought the price point was fine for the quality of the food and experience."
"It's the real deal. Been there 5 times now. Excellent. Lives up to the hype. Get the hiramasa, get the salad with fennel, goat pizza. It's all good. The bread is great, but it will fill you up, so be careful. Excellent service. The Girl and The Goat brand wines are superb."
"Great new restaurant in Chicago...very different food, but excellent....it set's itself apare from the other Chicago places. Â It's definitely worth the wait."
