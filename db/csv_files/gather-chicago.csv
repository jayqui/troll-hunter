Gather
"As I write this I'm sat at the kitchen counter; the best seat if you are a keen cook like me. I'm watching the team work their magic seamlessly. Producing amazing dishes of food with care and attention. I've not even had my order yet but I don't mind, I could sit here content for hours.The brunch cocktails are great, really flavourful and the coffee is good too. I've ordered the chicken and waffles and I lie that I can watch it being made and arriving. If you come here be sure to get the kitchen counter seats!Miso butter is a great invention and gives the umami that something so sweet as chicken and waffles needs. I know the chicken is fresh as I saw it being cooked! The waffles have a good vanilla flavour and the smoked maple is delicious. You must try this place out and don't forget, sit at the counter!"
"We've been eating at Gather since opening week and have yet to have a bad meal.Great location, great menu, great service - amazing all around."
"Delicious food, friendly service, and really beautiful space (although we were stuck at one of the four tables right outside the bathroom, which is the worst spot in the restaurant, especially compared to the gorgeous front and back areas). We really enjoyed the mussels appetizer, and my scallops were perfect. Prices were surprisingly low for what we got.My one issue was the insane wait time for our food--we were seated around 8:20 and didn't get our entrees until close to 10, with no explanation or apology. Also, strangely, when we tried to text our babysitter about the delay, neither of us had cell service--had to step outside to send the message.We'd definitely return but we'll request better seating and allow plenty of time."
"I was so surprised that Gather could give us such wonderful food, service, and ambience at such great menu prices - I almost had to do a double take.  (If we lived closer to Gather, we would probably eat here all the time!)  You get hearty portion sizes here as well.  We really enjoyed our visit, and Gather certainly earns its 4.5 average rating here on Yelp. The standouts for us were the Whipped Ricotta, Braised Pork Belly, and the Grilled Sirloin.  Toasted bread comes with the Whipped Ricotta, which is topped with what looked to be a balsamic reduction - the combination made for one of the best spreads I've tasted.  The Braised Pork Belly had a wonderful texture and was complimented well by the cherries, sautéed green beans, cherry gastrique, and creamy whole oats.  My favorite dish though was the Grilled Sirloin.  The meat was cooked perfectly to my liking and the I made sure to clean my plate of the carrot-ginger purée.  The service was fantastic.  We received just the right amount of attention, and they were quick on water refills and any requests that we had.  We sat near the back patio area, which was cozy and private.  And while we preferred the seating just inside of the patio, the outdoor seating area was well decorated and drew a lot of requests from patrons to sit outside.  It was a great experience, and we'd certainly like to find our way back here soon."
"Gather, as the name would suggest, is a delightful gathering spot. We came here for a Girls' Night Out and discovered that the passed plate ""Gather and Share"" options are phenomenal and the cocktails are well crafted.We started the night off with drinks. My first choice was the Overnight Sensation. It was really great, but I preferred my friend's Dark + Stormy. The winner of the night was their Whiskey Smash. I've said it before and I'll say it again, I really don't like whiskey, so if you can get me to enjoy it or something made with it, you're doing a great job! I absolutely adored that the few ingredients inside it played so well together. I gotta hand it to the server for this surprise suggestion.We couldn't decide what we wanted for our first course; thus, we ordered the Whipped Ricotta, Steak Tartare, Crispy Brussel [sic] Sprouts, Cured Salmon, Roasted Cauliflower and the Charred Green Beans. So, basically the entire starters menu. I regret nothing. Actually, I regret not having more Whipped Ricotta, because that was out of this world.The group's second favorite was the Cured Salmon. Our least favorite might have been the Steak Tartare. It was good, but not a standout. It's one of those things that's cool to try to say you did it but you don't necessarily need to repeat the experience. With that being said, I would gladly eat it again if someone else ordered it and was sharing. I just think there are much more memorable options on the menu.When it came to the main course, that was not at all a hard decision: ""Burger - white cheddar, house smoked bacon, caramelized onion, red pepper aïoli, brioche, fries."" It was a no-brainer. In fact, it sounded so tantalizing that the majority of us ordered that. Unfortunately, all of us who got it also thought it was completely lackluster. The burger was cooked a little past what we wanted, though the meat itself and the toppings had a good taste; however, the bun was incredibly dense and dry. I took the bun off and only ate half the burger. I would not order this again. They charge you $14, but this is not a burger worthy of that price tag. The perfectly cooked side of fries were the highlight of the dish.If I had a do-over, I would probably go for the Pan Seared Cod or Diver Scallops as my entrée instead.We went with 3 desserts at the end of the meal. We had a chocolate peanut butter dessert (decadent), chamomile panna cotta (light and delicate), and a beignet style apple fritter (fried goodness). I'd say go with the panna cotta if you wanna keep it light, but you get more mouth bang for the buck with the chocolate peanut butter or the fritter.In conclusion, come for the cocktails and the smaller courses. Do pass the burger. Do not collect $200. Do do the desserts!"
"Had an absolutely perfect birthday dinner with Gather last Saturday night, and I still can't stop thinking about it! Gather is understated and immediately feels like a friendly neighborhood spot. Most importantly, I was blown away by the service-- everyone from the welcoming hostess, to our super-informative and witty waitress Jamie, to the bartender who took the time to explain to us what Cynar is (and how to pronounce it properly), and finally to our bus staff who never rushed us and always kept our area clean. We had a wonderful table out in their back patio, which by the way is amazing. Tucked away off the street, it's very quiet and private from any neighbors. There's a nice roof which I imagine comes in handy during the summer sun, has some pretty greenery and hedges along with some cute lights to set the mood. Gather is a wine bar, so naturally we began with cocktails and moved to a bottle of red wine later in the evening. Our waitress, Jamie, helped us through the menu as there were about 10-12 items that caught our eye.Ultimately, we settled on the whipped ricotta appetizer, beet salad, brussels sprouts, curry gnocchi (special of the evening) and the siroloin steak. All the items were delivered very thoughtfully -- paired appropriately, delivered at the perfect time intervals, and they even split the sirloin steak for us without our asking. All of the food was equally unique and special. They have an open kitchen, and it was very cool to walk past and see the effort and time spent on each dish by the chefs. We absolutely loved the brussels sprouts, and the whipped ricotta with honey and balsamic was a treat and dessert in itself. I cannot wait to be back. This place won my heart over by creating exceptional food and top-notch service in a comfortable, understated atmosphere. Love love love it."
"Definitely a 5 star experience! It didn't hurt that one of the guys in our party knew the owner. We had amaaaaazing service from start to finish....and 5 bottles of wine later, we were feeling pretty nice! But y'all, the food.....exceptional!! I can't begin to tell you how delightful every morsel of food was. We probably tried half of the menu. I can't even remember everything we had. I'll list what I remember below:Brussel sprouts - oh my goodness, get these!Beets with feta - ridiculous flavorsMussels - be sure to dip the pretzel bread in the coconut milk sauce!Steak Tartare - quite possibly the best I've ever hadWe had this egg, mushroom, and popcorn dish - phenom!!Tuna Poke - seriously, immaculately delish!Ramp Pasta Dish - one of my faves of the nightGrilled Steak - wonderfulSeveral other things that I don't rememberThen there was dessert.....I know we had three things...one was fried donut balls, some sort of truffley chocolate thing, and a pie thing. They were all so delicious! This is definitely one of my new favorite spots!"
"Everything we had was delicious. Sat at the bar and had excellent service. Great ambiance. The steak was amazing, also had heirloom beets and heirloom tomato appetizers which were very tasty. Would definitely be a regular if I lived in Chi!"
"I've been wanting to try Gather for the longest time, so I was super excited when it was my turn to pick the restaurant for the next GNO.Making reservations wasn't easy or difficult.  We had a group of 9, so we originally got stuck with a table a little later at 8:30 p.m.  I hoped my group of ravenous gal pals wouldn't mind.  A few weeks later, one of my friends called and was able to move the reservation up to 7:00 p.m.There wasn't any street parking available, but there's a lot nearby that fills up fast.  I'm not familiar with the area, so I'm not sure if there's any convenient, free parking nearby.Gather was was packed on a Thursday night, so make reservations or be disappointed.  The hustle and bustle made me think it HAD to be good.  I sat at the bar while I waited for the rest of the group, and I tried one of their cocktails, ""The Count,"" made with St. Germain, vodka, and grapefruit.  I subbed the vodka for gin, and it was sublime.  I later had a sparkling white wine with St. Germain, equally good.The shared plates/appetizers and cocktails at Gather are wonderful.  We ordered almost one of each dish:  whipped ricotta, cured salmon, steak tartare, cauliflower, and green beans.  The whipped ricotta, with honey and balsamic, is creamy and sweet enough to be a dessert; a few of us considered ordering a second round of it.  The cured salmon with creme fraiche and capers is also a must-have, and my first taste of steak tartare also ranked pretty high.  The  veggies were better than standard veggies, but they're still just veggies.Those shared plates set my expectations pretty darn high for our entrees.  5 of 8 of us ordered the burger.  5 of 5 of us were disappointed with it.  The burger was a thick patty which lacked flavor/seasoning, and it was piled onto a fluffy, but bone dry, brioche bun needing more sauce.  The burger was about $12-14 but wasn't worth even half that.  It was really disappointing to see us slathering what should be a ""gourmet"" burger with garlic mayo, ketchup, and anything we could get our hands on.Others at our table had the scallops, which I heard were great.The desserts were amazing.  Others were more excited about the rich, creamy, chocolate & peanut butter dessert, most were over the moon about the apple fritters, but me?  Chamomile panna cotta.  Light chamomile flavor, creamy panna cotta, and a blood orange glaze.  Oh my.I thought the service at Gather was great.  Despite the restaurant being crowded and noisy, the manager checked on me twice while I waited at the bar, the bartender was attentive, and our waitress did well too.There's a patio too, which I could totally get down with relaxing here for some cocktails, shared plates, and panna cotta."
"Nice menu, good wine/cocktail/beer list, accepts reservations...all the makings for a great gals night out.  We were seated at a high top table in the back--views of the patio. Our server was attentive and helpful and her personality matched our boisterous group well. We opened with drinks and several small plates to share, then each had an entree and then shared the desserts. Drinks for me: opened with a glass of Cava. My usual is always a bubbly at the beginning and the Cava was a nice refreshing opener.  Dark and Stormy later was well made and tasty.The small plates: whipped ricotta with honey and balsamic was clearly the winner at the table.  Light and fluffy and creamy, I joked that I could have eaten the whole mini mason jar of it myself...maybe not joking..it was so delicious. The cured salmon was my second favorite--good quality salmon along with a bit of the cucumber creme fraiche was delightful. The others--steak tartare, green beans and cauliflower were just OK to me.  For my main I decided on the scallops--diver scallops, crispy bacon, caramelized treviso, roasted celery root,cara cara orange, vanilla scented celery root purée, XO dust.  It was delicious.  The scallops were perfectly cooked and plated so beautifully. Our desserts: A chocolate peanut butter dessert, apple fritters, chamomile panna cotta.  The standout for me was the apple fritter--served warm, it was sugary and soft and comforting--just like a good fritter should be.  The other desserts were good, but the apple fritter won my heart. The space is small, but they make good use of it.  Perfect for date nights or groups. The patio looked really nice too."
"Looooved their Sunday night family style dinner menu. Who doesn't love a meal that is meant to be communally shared with many friends? On top of this, everything on the supper menu was delicious. The fried chicken, spaghetti and meatballs, and polenta are particular stand outs that are so comforting to have on Sunday night. Then to top it off, everyone gets their own dessert."
"As someone who lives for cheese and charcuterie, Gather gave me so much happiness. One of my favorite meals in chicago. The gathering board was perfect, and our server let us enjoy the entire thing before rushing out another dish as fast as possible to turn our table. The wine list definitely has something for everybody to enjoy with the gathering board. We also ordered the heirloom beets, apple salad, and octopus, simply because I can never NOT order beets or octopus when I see them on a menu. Gather did not disappoint. The restaurant is cozy, dark, and a good place for a romantic dinner. I tried to bring my boyfriend back here though and they were randomly closed at 7 pm on a week night when their website definitely said they were open. Lincoln Square has some great options so we went elsewhere but I was still kinda bummed. I love this place."
"Gather came highly recommended by my cousin who asked for an exact time and count of people attending because this Sunday brunch hot spot requires reservations! We started with the homemade donut for an appetizer which is covered in a bacon maple glaze. This is a must even if shared!! All the food is delicious, the juices are squeezed in-house, and if nothing else the breakfast beers make a perfect pairing with any brunch item."
"We randomly stopped in last night to check out a wine bar in the new neighborhood. Our initial idea was to just get a bottle of wine and then head back out but we ended up ordering food, dessert, cocktails and wine. 2 hours later we were so happy for this random visit. Gather offers not only a decent selection of wines but fantastic food and a lovely outdoor back patio area. The servers, the hostess and everyone we met who was working there were very friendly and informative.The whipped ricotta was absolutely amazing, as was the sweet breads. The only reason I deduct one star is that I wish they would incorporate a little more wine selections but also offer wine flights. If they do offer wine flights, I did not see it in an obvious area. But that shouldn't stop you from going if you are ever near by."
"An absolute fantastic meal from start to finish.   We ordered 4-5 small bites to enjoy as starters and everything was flawless.   Beautifully prepared and extremely flavorful and well balanced with flavors.  We also ordered the scallops to share and they plated it for us instead of it coming out on one plate for the three of us.   Their wine selections/menu is well thought out and the two wines we choose paired perfectly with the food.   All in all each of us were so incredibly impressed by our experience and we are all big foodies.  The prices were very reasonable for the quality of the food and nice portion sizes.   I am from Sonoma County, California and I will be reminiscing about my experience here until I return.   Bravo for a really special and memorable dining experience.  Thank you Gather family!  I look forward to visiting Chicago again soon so I can come back to your restaurant."
"Went here with a dear friend for my birthday.We shared the ricotta sharing plate, had a cocktail each, and each had the chicken entree. We took our time, and it was a great experience.The autumn cocktail was very unique- when you are about to take a sip it feels like eggnog, but then tastes like spiced cider. It was tasty, although actually a little too strong for my preferences. The whipped ricotta plate was one of my favorite things I've eaten in quite awhile. It was beautiful and bountiful. Easily shared between three people. The chicken entree was very nice- two types of chicken, polenta, and pureed vegetables. It was a little overly savory to me. I would have liked a side of sweet potato or peas or even a small fresh salad to offset the very savory chicken and existing sides. But everything was delicious, and the chicken was perfectly cooked.Only weird thing to me is that the service seems a little too casual for the setting. Hard to put my finger on but the clothing choices of the waitstaff and their general mannerisms (not including the guys refilling waters) was just really too casual for the menu and ambience."
"My roommate and I went out with the intention of getting drinks and picked this place for the ambiance. When we got there, we were delighted to hear about their desserts (the rhubarb tart was delicious!!) and their tea selection. So, instead of alcohol, we had tea and dessert. The staff was friendly, the ambiance was similar to the pictures, the wait time wasn't long, and the tea was really good. I think the price was a bit high for what we got, but everything else about it was so enjoyable!I give it 4.7 stars, but because that's not possible, I'll give it 5."
"Overall: great place for a yummy, non-traditional brunch. Menu is small but lots of unique dishes. Likes:- Service was good and friendly - we had to be somewhere after brunch and they made sure we were taken care of- All three of us got the bacon and sausage skillet because our server raved about it. Portion was just right, sausage was really flavorful, and it was served deliciously hot- They take reservations! My favorite trait of a Chicago brunch spot!Gripes:- Really loud - it was hard to have a conversation!- Don't sit in front if it's cold outside, we kept getting a frigid draft"
"Well, what can I say that already hasn't been said. Great food. Great service. Great atmosphere. One of my personal favorites in the city. One of the best in the north neighborhoods. I recommend getting the chef's table."
"Friday night dinner . . 3 people . .reservation @6pm . .2 of us arrived on time and got the frustrating command to wait at the bar until our 3rd party arrived.  We got knocked around so much in the tight space surrounding the bar we begged to be seated at our table and promised to order drinks until our 3rd arrived (she was stuck in traffic and arrived 15"" later).The receptionist couldn't have more un-accommodating. . in robot fashion, she kept saying ""it wouldn't be fair"" to seat us . .what's fair about making people with a reservation wait?!  She couldn't have been more frustrating and I finally had to ask her to stop saying ""it wouldn't be fair"" . .guess she had a script from management.Food was excellent, wait staff delightful but a LONG wait . . not fair, I'd say :-)"
"Came to Gather for Sunday brunch with two friends around 11:30 am. We only had to wait around 20-25 minutes to get seated which was really nice! The restaurant is really cool inside with multiple bars (including one up against the kitchen) and a variety of different table sizes. We sat out back in the outdoor patio which was awesome. Ivy covered walls surround the shaded patio and there are fun big-bulb light strands hung up around the perimeter.Service was solid, nothing special. We ordered a sticky bun to start with (delicious) but it didn't come until our entrees did, which I thought the waiter should have mentioned. That is my only complaint though! Gather still gets a 5 star rating from me because the food was delicious! We ordered the flatjacks, the french toast and the skillet. Everything looked and tasted outstanding. My french toast had blueberries and lemon scented ricotta on top which was a great combination. Every entree we saw brought out to the patio looked great; I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu!This is a fantastic brunch option in Lincoln Square. If you're in the area you should definitely stop by!"
"Heard great things about Gather.Food was fine, not overwhelmingly good.Prices were expensive relative to portion.Service was poor.Dessert looked good but waitress disappeared so we got frustrated (again) at inability to order.We decided not to spend any more $ here.(Went to flirty cupcakes instead-yum)Not going back to Gather.  More interesting food at better price point elsewhere."
"One of the BEST meals I have had in a very long time! First off, the place is adorable. I loved the ambiance and decor. Secondly, the wait staff was great - they were helpful from start to finish! I really enjoyed the layout of the menu and after looking at everything, we decided to skip the main entree's and instead sample the share plates and apps. We started off with the smoked salmon and holy fish this was good. I would HIGHLY recommend getting this. Secondly, we had the honey ricotta and that was super tasty as well. I dont think anything directly following that salmon would have tasted as good, though. Thirdly, and this dish was by far the knockout, we ordered the Raviolo. I cant even begin to describe how wonderful this dish was! A. pasta. B. egg inside C. TRUFFLE butter. It was so rich and decadent, yet, I could have consumed 3 more! Lastly, and the most disappointing, we had the Octopus. This was kinda just 'meh' for me. I would order all three of the above dishes again in a heart beat, though!Gather also has a great wine and beer list with affordable options. If you know me, you know I hate paying $12/$13 for a glass of wine, and this was not the case here. I had a nice sangiovese for $9 a glass! I will definitely be coming back to Gather. They also have a great room in the back that can host a dinner (up to 12) as well if you wanted something more private."
"We were supposed to have dinner at a nearby restaurant last night but decided to pop in to Gather at 6:45 since I've wanted to check it out.  Boy we were psyched that they were able to accommodate us without a reservation.  After grabbing a drink at their very nice bar we were seated in the patio after 15-20 min.  It's a beautiful space and really transports you to another world.  The food was excellent--top to bottom.  From the roasted brussel sprouts to the home made pasta with chicken and vegetables to our perfectly cooked scallops.  Oh and the chocolate dessert with peanut butter brittle was killer.  This is the kind of restaurant I would go to monthly if I lived anywhere near it.  It's a great looking place, great vibe, knowledgeable service and fantastic food."
"For the food I would give this place 4 stars. I have only gotten appetizers when I went though so that might have something to do with it. The food is good, I just wasn't blow away by anything.However, the service is so good and the drinks are great, enough to bump the overall rating up to a 5. I have been there when its warmer in the patio and in the winter. Its not a large place so it gets packed quickly. The patio is very cute. The service is always outstanding and very accommodation. They have a good wine selection and the mixed drinks are amazing. I would even say some of the best I have had in the city.  The bar tender told us they have brunch on Sundays only, but we haven't been to that yet. But I guess it gets packed so make a reservation!"
"I love food and flavors however, this was completely unusual. Starters...grilled octopus - what the hell was that sauce? Pared horribly! Potatoes without skin would have worked. Steak tartare was delicious with exception of the sweet American bread. Entrees...I am HUGE lover of scallops. WTF was this sauce?! And weird grains and berries. I mean...WTF?? I wanted a seafood dish not little house on the prairie! The braised sirloin was ordered medium and arrived rare. It was slightly gamey. The best parts of this experience were the drinks and the pony tailed busser. Very let down. Was expecting something different I guess."
"All that magic from that little kitchen? Really? My friends and I came in here sans reservation and they weren't stuffy about letting us in or anything. They put us on a list and asked if we could come back in 30 minutes. We went to the bar next door for to kill some time. As I entered the doors of this place, it felt very welcomed and the food aromas were making me salivate. The restaurant itself isn't very big at all but they make the decor work with the space. We sat way in the back room and saw these giant walls of wines. Which made my friends at ease that they were about to have some amazing wines. Our waitress was there in no time getting our wine and drink orders in. As we were waiting I observed that they had a beautiful enclosed patio for outdoor service during the nicer weathered months. From what I saw, it looked gorgeous! What can I say? I am a girl who loves the patios!So we get our wines and drinks and ordered our food. We ordered the Crispy Brussels sprouts salad. Which I loved every moment of. I think it was probably the most delicious preparation of Brussels Sprout I have ever had the pleasure to eat. They sprinkle some Bonito Flakes on there for more depth of flavor and dress the crispy Brussels sprouts with a vinaigrette with toasted pistachios. We also ordered the Gathering Board which was a charcuterie board with a selection of Cured meats, seasonal jam, honey with some honeycomb, toasted almonds, Manchengo and bleu cheeses, duck pate and toast points. It should go without saying that I love charcuterie boards. This one is so bountiful and all the flavors work very well together. I ordered the Half Chicken cooked two ways (Fried and seared) over creamy polenta. The chicken was perfectly cooked and the creamy polenta was like something out of a dream with some trumpet mushrooms to give it an earthy flavor. It was divine. My friend has the Grilled Sirloin and I had a few bites from his plate (because that's how we roll) and the steak was perfectly pink in the middle and that Tom Yum puree really set off the of the whole dish. My other friend ordered the burger but it was far from those regular burgers you see at other joints. This burger was beautiful and elevated flavor wise. Some serious cookin' comes out of that little kitchen, I am not sure how but I tip my hat to those chefs. Bravo!The service was really good and the server really knew what she was talking about when it came to food and wines. Everything seems like and elevated down homey type of feel. The bill wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. We all had a great time and I hope to check out Gather for their infamous brunch! Please excuse the dark pictures but I didn't want to be rude and blind my table mates with my flash."
"Make a reservation and, even if it is a busy Saturday night, you will be seated promptly, your waitress will greet you moments after and you and your best friends will be having amazing cocktails, a delicious, homemade ricotta appetizer and even better main courses!! If you sit on their patio, all of the above will be even more wonderful! Go now!!"
"Every time I eat somewhere else I think, ""Man, I wish we were at Gather instead"". It's simply one of the best restaurants in Chicago. The ambiance is on point, the food is consistently delicious and the staff is generally friendly and helpful. Have you not been before? Here's what you order for dinner: Start with the Gathering Board, it is amazing. I'd say you can be content with one board for two - four people. (They will bring you more bread if you need it, which is always appreciated. Thank you, Gather.) Everything on that board is delicious. Mix and match. Have a good time. Put the honey on the cheese with some almonds and whipped mouse. Go for it. Feel alive! Next get the brussels sprouts. They are a consistent delight and if they are ever removed from the menu part of my soul will die. After that, order the chicken. I know! Just chicken? You say - yes. Just get the chicken. It will rock your body. Dessert - it's optional. The coffee is good (French Press) and I like that peanut butter chocolate concoction with a red wine reduction....but I don't love it. I've also tried the rhubarb crumble thing (usually I'm a huge rhubarb fan) but it also didn't entirely win me over. It was ok. However, Ok at gather is still 'great' at any other establishment. Their cocktails are also nice. There was an autumnal something or other with egg whites and cinnamon that's no longer on the seasonal summer menu that I hope makes a return this fall! Anyway, take your friends to this restaurant and become the person who really knows how to pick 'em."
"The best restaurant in the Lincoln Square neighborhood!  Great place for a date, a gathering, or to watch chef's prepare their masterpieces!Service - As good as the top rated steak houses, they took our coats when we sat down and would not accept any tips for a coat check when we left!  I never had to wait for service!  The whole staff was very genuine and friendly!Atmosphere- cozy, comfortable, and there is an option to sit at the kitchen counter to watch the food being prepared.  You will have to make reservations ahead of time for this!Food- Outstanding!  My favorites: Whipped Ricotta, Sweet Potato Soup, and the Half Chicken.  I wanted to take the Ricotta home with me, its unbelievable!  The Soup is fantastic, there are a couple pieces of maple raised bacon that blend well with this soup.  I took this soup down in 1 minute!  I will definitely be back for brunch to order the chicken biscuit and flapjacks!There is a great selection of cocktails and beer here, I warmed up with a Dark 'n' Stormy.  The wine list is very impressive, I felt I needed to have at least a glass!Innovation: The Kitchen Counter option is fantastic, as not all restaurants offer this!  Other than Dinner, Gather offers a Brunch menu and a Sunday Dinner menu that is served a la carte.  I will definitely be back to try all of these options!"
"After months of meaning to stop in, I finally got to try Gather with my girlfriends for my birthday dinner! Perfect ladies night spot, although I would definitely bring my guy here too. We loved all the drinks, as well as the food we tried. To be honest, one of the main things that drew me here was tales of the Gathering Board - their cheese and charcuterie sampler. I sort of live for cheese and charcuterie, with a side of wine obviously, and I surround myself with people who feel the same way. We all loved this board! Perfect mix of meats and cheeses, with awesome accenting bits and smears of honey and jam. My friend and I agreed that we would have eaten the mousse just alone by the spoonful. I would probably stop in here again just for this board.We also tried the crispy brussel sprouts, which we enjoyed. Crispy brussel sprouts are having a moment, and these were very good compared to those I've gotten at other places, but b-sprouts will never be the star of a meal IMOThe third thing we tried was the steak tartare, which was also excellent. The thing here that was nice is they actually give you a good amount. I feel like other times I've ordered tartare, they give you about 1/2 a cup of meat with an entire loaf of bread.We also started with cocktails, that were very good but not memorable. I loved the wine we had, though. Their selections in both categories were really great. The only minus of the experience was the service wasn't perfect...I don't fault them very much because it was a Saturday night, but we sat for almost 10 minutes at the table before our server came over, and then they were not entirely present the entire night, but like I said, it was busy and it didn't ruin the mood of a fun, enjoyable dinner. I will definitely stop in again"
"This place is so outstanding that I've dined here twice in one week!Last night was for dinner, and once again it was phenomenal.  You just can't go wrong with 100% organic, sustainable, farm to table cuisine.We wanted to sample a lot of the menu so for starters we began with the grilled peaches and burrata along with the wagyu beef tartare.  Holy smokes was the tartare the star!  Absolutely delicious!For dinner I had the scallops while my husband had the chicken.  You're probably thinking, ugh chicken why?  This chicken was incredibly moist and tender just like a juicy turkey on Thanksgiving day.  Now for the scallops.  3 large beautiful scallops as sweet as the day is long... with beets 3 ways, this was perfect.  It would have been even better if there weren't bacon cooked in with the beets, but this is only a personal preference.  Bacon is like the new parsley, it's sprinkled on everything these days and you just can't seem to get away from it.Dessert was vanilla bean panna cotta with blueberry emulsion and white chocolate flakes with pinenuts.  This was delectable and went well with the French press coffee.Another 5 star experience at only $140 for all courses and food that matches (and exceeds) that of some of the fine dining establishments I've been to."
"Best.food.ever...Enough said. We started with the mussels and it comes with a pretzel bread and the sauce was very flavorful. I ordered the burger and my date ordered the tagatelle and they were both really tasty. It's as though they put extra flavonoids (not a real word,but works for this review) in the food! I usually never give 5 stars but this place is incredibly delicious and I HIGHLY recommend. Whatever you order you won't be disappointed!"
"I returned to give Gather another shot.  This time the place was packed and they had many more staff and handled our group of 6 pretty well.  I don't go for their more exotic menu items but the burger I had was excellent.   The 7.5oz Diet Coke is still a total joke but most folks going here are drinking far more expensive stuff.   Very loud in here on this night and hard to talk even across the table.  So, I no longer see it as a disaster but have heard from others that it is hit and miss here. This night was a hit, the previous....well I think I covered this pretty well previously."
"Been there for dinner and brunch, and both are delicious. I appreciate that the menu is well-curated: you're not overwhelmed with a lot of options, and you can be well assured that anything you order will be dang delicious. If you like Eggs Benedict, you have to try their Benedict. Gather, you had me at truffle oil."
"I was visiting a friend in Chicago for the weekend and was given the honor of scouting out a brunch spot. Good ol' yelp did not let me down, this place was great!I have heard horror stories of wait times for brunch spots in Chicago (2.5 hours for some pancakes? not going to work, I 'm Hungry), but we were seated almost immediately. We had a hard time getting anyone to wait on us once we were seated, maybe because we were at a communal-table and we looked like awkward late-arriving friends of the girls seated near us. Either way, we were lost a little in the shuffle waiting to order and for refills etc, but no worries because once we got our food it was delicious. That's what you come for anyway, right?We shared a sticky bun (do it), and then did a little halfsies switcheroo with the eggs benedict and the chicken fried biscuit. They were both awesome, right down to the crispy season-y potatoes on the side, but if I had to pick just one next time I would go for that chicken fried biscuit. I am a southern girl, you have to work pretty hard to impress me with fried chicken, but with perfectly crisp, slightly sweet skin they did it. If I'm ever back in the area I will be bugging my friend to take me back."
"This place is outstanding. It was honestly one of the best meals I've had in a long time, and the other two guests in my party agree. Their signature cocktails were fantastic. The Gather Board was beautiful and delicious (get. this.)The brussel sprouts were the best I've ever had. we split the squash soup and apple salad between all of us and they were so tasty. Between the three people at my table, we ordered the steak (cooked perfectly), the scallops (delicious) and the chicken, and all were very good. For dessert, we ordered some sort of banana cake, which was the weakest part of the meal, but that's ok. Our drinks took a while to arrive, but one they finally did, our service hit a nice stride. Also, I didn't feel like I was paying an arm and a leg for this meal. We had so much to eat, each had a signature cocktail and ordered a nice bottle of wine with dinner, and we got out of there for well under $100 per person.I will definitely come back, and you should too."
"I save 5 stars for really exceptional spots...and Gather is one of them.  I went for brunch on Sunday and had a phenomenal experience from start to finish.The space is cute and they save 50% of the seats for walk-ins which is a really great move for a neighborhood spot.  Service was friendly and helpful and the food was ah-mazing.I ordered the fried chicken and biscuit and went with our server's suggestion to add a short stack of pancakes.  I told my friend I couldn't decide which I liked the best: the chicken (fried to perfection and boneless - I was worried when I saw ""leg"" but they serve it de-boned), the biscuit (hearty and delicious), the potatoes (tasted double cooked - soft on the inside but crispy on the outside, yum!) and then the pancakes (the perfect balance of fluffy and substantial).  I loved absolutely everything I was served.  I tried a bite of my friend's skillet.  It looks deceptively simple, but the flavors are outstanding.  You can tell all the ingredients are of the highest quality, the sausage tasted like it was made in house with delicious rosemary and other seasoning.  The whole thing was delicious and satisfying.  If tea is your thing, this is the spot!  They have 10-15 options, I went with the Bourbon Vanilla Chai (yum!) and my friend enjoyed her hibiscus tea.  They also serve Intelligensia for the coffee crowd.From start to finish, this was fantastic, I will be back for dinner (and definitely more brunch!)"
"Good food bad hospitality.I don't have any complaints about the food. It was a nicely combined balanced dishes.But hospitality is horrible. Overall restaurant is a service industry. I told the host that I was one person and I was crammed to a corner of the bar. I asked for a table and was told to wait for 45 minutes. So I took the seat at the bar. Half of my elbow was on the drinks mat, and sometimes elbow fight with a waitress until the bartender moved the mats and created more space. All the while I have been watching the empty two tables that I can see from my seat. One table got seated after being 40 minutes while the host apologized for the long wait to the people. The other table got seated 45+ minutes at which time I had already finished and asked for my check. At this time I see another 3 tables empty.I believe the host didn't want to waste a table of two on a single person. It is my second time here but I need something really compelling to bring me back here for a third."
"Gather is my new favorite place. We've been to Gather twice in the last 2 months tasting both the brunch and the dinner menu. Dinner and Brunch were amazing!  We enjoyed...Brunch:*The sticky buns: very good but very sweet so be prepared for sugar overload. *The sweet potato casserole was perfect: sweet potatoes, eggs, and brussels sprouts. Fantastic!*The skillet: pork shoulder was warm and delicious on a cold Sunday morning.Dinner:*Brussels sprouts-I love brussels sprouts and this place does not disappoint. They have bacon and toasted pistachios with cheese on them! *Steak tar tar was phenomenal and was very fresh (my favorite in the city).*The half chicken was great with a crispy outside and a perfectly moist inside. *Braised Short Rib: so delicious and the other items on the plate we're great as well. We'll be returning back for more."
"Just dined next to the mayor, no biggie! I'm sorry, all politics aside, if the mayor of Chicago decides he would like to dine here with some friends on a Saturday night, then I have to think, it's got to be a pretty good restaurant, right?! Gotta figure he gets invited to a lot of the top notch city spots.So - it's got that going for it. Then, I'm told that this place was on Check Please. Must have been the episode from the night before and it must be saved on my DVR. So - it's got that going for it.Then the service - the guy working the door was extremely personable and went out of his way to find us a place to sit that he thought we would like. The server was like a friend by the end of the night, we were chit chatting about other diners, places around the city, and the restaurant's history.  Our server also made tons of recommendations and we basically went with all of them. Every morsel of food we ordered was delectable. From drinks to brussel sprouts, I was wowed by all of it. I would definitely go back. My husband proclaimed it his new favorite restaurant - drinks alone were awesome and the service might be the best I've ever experienced!"
"Restaurant came highly rated and was excited to sample their menu, had an excellent early dining experience but was extremely disappointed when a repeated request to move tables due to cold air blowing upon my wife and I was ignored by the waitress and hostess.  Upon alerting management to the issue, and the fact that our food temperature and personal comfort were negatively impacted , we were ignored and felt disrespected.  Front of house does not match the quality of the kitchen, recommend take-out only!"
"I am nearly bursting at the seams even while writing this review. My friends and I had a wonderful time at Gather taking advantage of their Sunday family style dinner offer. The dining area features a bar and open kitchen, along with a patio for outdoor seating in the back of the restaurant. Service was on point in terms of attentiveness, speed and a pleasant attitude. We decided to go with the scrumptious fried chicken, pasta, and sausage options for the family style dinner, which also included sides of broccoli and creamy polenta for the table. Everything was so good we could barely decide our favorite dish, but the boneless fried chicken and amazing crispy cornbread with honey butter eked out a slight edge over the others.We also added on the miso and bonito flake brussels sprouts and ricotta a la carte based on high recommendations from one party member. These two dishes did not arrive at the table with the rest of the meal but we barely even noticed. By the time our server checked in with us, there was so much food already that we cancelled the ricotta, and she actually graciously comped the sprouts due to the slight delay. Talk about amazing service. The sprouts were well worth the short wait and we will definitely be back to try the ricotta some time soon. The Dark and Stormy cocktail was also quite refreshing with hints of ginger and lime mixed with rum.Do yourself a favor and try this place out!"
"The back patio is awesome ... food delicious and the hostess was awesome. During dinner the actual waitress was a bit slow, but the place was packed on Friday night. The brussel sprouts were spectacular. The halibut was a bit overdone for me and the steak was nice, but smaller portion if you're looking for hearty sustenance. Cocktails were absolutely delicious - I only wish the bar was a little bigger so more people could get a drink while waiting."
"Can't say much more than what everyone else has already written. Great food, great patio area and ambiance. We went in a Sunday and did the family style (choose 3 options) for $26 per person. Excellent pacing of the food as it came out in quasi- courses (more or less) and we even had leftovers. Will definitely be back!"
"Every morsel & component of every dish fantastically delicious. Beet salad, tuna poke, Brussels sprouts& whipped ricotta , all out of this world!  Steak tartare also best I've ever had. Dinner partners had the tagliatelle & said it was good but the item they enjoyed the least. We had the chicken on polenta & am still thinking about it!  Cocktails super good as well. Love vibe. Is loud but everywhere is. Hostess lovely. Server good but more of a 4. Can't wait to gather again!  Huge big fat winner for the chi & my neighborhood."
"I've been to Gather a few times now and while one visit wasn't perfect, I will say that overall, I've had a few great meals there.I've been there with groups of 2, 4 and a larger group of about 10 (when we had the big group, we got a table that was in between the main dining room and the patio by ourselves - it was really nice!).  I've tried all sorts of menu items, though the ricotta with honey really stands out for me, as does the burger.  I think that some of the menu options are a bit skewed in terms of the price/value ratio, but overall, the quality of the food is there as well as the value.  My friend and I had dinner there the other night and she and I split the ricotta, brussel sprouts and burger and we were totally stuffed!  They had told us we hadn't ordered enough, but it was more than plenty for two unless you have someone with a huge appetite!The atmosphere is a bit loud, but I like the bar area and the dim lighting along with the lively room.  Wines, beers and cocktails are offered and there are plenty of options for everyone.  I'd love to sit out on the patio in the summer, but I haven't managed to fit that in yet...hopefully next summer.  Food - 4Atmosphere - 5Value - 4Service - 5Bathrooms - 4"
"Brunch is definitely worth the trip out to Lincoln Square here!!!! Chicken fried cheese biscuit, with a fried chicken leg,  béchamel, and home fries?? Yup. You may need to do a big work out after that meal, but I promise you it is worth that extra effort!That fried chicken was magical and that biscuit was perfect. And I am pretty picky when it comes to my biscuits too. The home fries were the low of the dish for me to be honest, but the rest of that dish so so so so good! The boys got the sweet potato hash and they could not stop talking about how that was some of the best pork belly they had experienced ever on our train ride all the way back--plus pairing that with some brussel sprouts (a little healthy choice there! ha), and rosemary and chives? Another winner of a dish. The skillet dish with a little braised pork shoulder and fried egg and avocado  and beans and salsa also had a great presentation and taste, and the benedict also was pretty solid too. Can't really make a wrong choice here unless you are counting your calories.It is a small restaurant inside too so you can't come here with a large group, but our party of 6 had a nice high top table--although it was SO HOT in temperature in that place when we ate there. I have no idea why. But hopefully that helped me burn off maybe a bite of that delicious fried chicken :)"
"My wife and I passed by this place so many times and have promised to eat here, but never do. We finally got a chance to have dinner here and were very satisfied. The host took our coats, which is an old school gesture, but I love it. It immediately gives off the impression that they will take care of you. This place is kind of narrow, but long and there's an open view to the kitchen, which I'm loving more and more in restaurants. We sat at the far end of the restaurant where there was a big wall of bottles of wine hung up.Our waitress was very excellent and the service was top notch.  We got the mushroom risotto to share, which was amazing. It was creamy and flavorful and the mushrooms weren't tough. My wife got the pumpkin soup while I got the half chicken on top of creamy polenta.The chicken was extremely tender while the polenta melted in my mouth. In tried some of my wife's soup and it a perfect combination of sweet and savory. We'll definitely be back here for brunch."
Had a great time at this restaurant with a friend. The cocktails were DEEEEEELISH. The service was super friendly and the food was awesome. Loved the seating outdoors and the flexibility of the menu (tasting menu vs a la carte).
"I loved the look and ambiance of Gather with the low lighting and open kitchen so I was definitely expecting the food to be just as impressive. Unfortunately, though, Gather failed to deliver. We had the whipped ricotta, raviolo, pork belly, and burger and all of these, with the exception of the whipped ricotta, just seemed to fall short. The raviolo was very good but it was a bit undercooked and I don't think anyone likes crunchy pasta. It's hard to go wrong with whipped ricotta on warm toast so this was my favorite dish. The pork belly was plated beautifully but taste and texture-wise it fell flat, and the bun on the burger was totally overwhelming and took away from the taste of the burger. I would definitely recommend reservations as almost every table was filled on a weeknight. Great atmosphere for an intimate date, but we just didn't get lucky with the dishes we ordered."
"2 of us loved this place because the food is inventive and delicious.  We started off with great cocktails - Overnight Sensation (which I intend to recreate at home), A Whiskey Smash and even the house Cabernet was delicious that our 3rd person was enjoying.  We had 2 starters to share - the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and the Mushroom Risotto... loved them both.. The Mushroom Risotto was an egg yolk mixer and it had Cardoons in it (haven't had those since I was a kid growin up in an Italian home) .. wow.. great flavors. Both were great..For the entree - had the Tagliatelle Pasta - which the noodles were perfection.  All was good but I would have liked a bit more Italian Sausage personally.  Especially given the small portion.  My partner had the Grilled Sirloin and isn't usually a fan of the extra sauces, but this one he loved (ordered it on the side to be safe)... For Dessert, we had the Bourbon Banana Bread w/ Chili Chocolate (in other stuff I can't recall) as well as a small tasting portion of the Apple Fritters (cool that they would do that for us..).. I think I'd go with the Fritters if I had to pick again.  As much as I liked the Banana Bread, couldn't get over the presentation.. kind of looked like Pate smeared on the side.. (which you could also think of as something else much less appealing..)  The service is intentionally made to make you feel like you are part of the family.  By the way, definitely a young young vibe here.. considering the prices, that alone was unique.. Very fast service without being too fast and extremely friendly.  Our server (Jen?) was there for just over a year and was explaining how the staff is really one big happy family - that's what they try for so that the warm family feeling spills over to the customers I am guessing.  So.. I will say, my partner and i will be definitely returning.  We tend to not go out as often so when we do, we want inventive tasty food that we couldn't do ourselves.  The 3rd person, thought the food was overpriced and the atmosphere not as nice as The Portage (which is another of my favorites).   I couldn't disagree more.. but anyhow, to quote Meatloaf (the singer, not the dish) ""2 out of 3 ain't bad""."
"David and his staff are beyond gracious and no matter how busy they are, I am always guaranteed a hug and warm welcome  each visit. The atmosphere is quite inviting with tasteful decor and easy lighting. Patio is equally lovely and the temperature is well monitored on the windier days.As far as eats go, the fried sprouts & steak tartar are essential for starters. But my personal favorites, the gnocchi and scallops, are simply out of this world. And as a native southerner, the apple crumble for dessert takes me home each taste.I brought family from out of town here for brunch this past Easter & not only were our main entrees divine, but the meat and pastry platters were just as picturesque as they were savory. And to top it off when it came time to pay our bill, Kimberly presented us a lovely wrapped loaf of freshly baked strawberry bread. Five stars all day for Gather. Thank you, David, Eric, Ken, and gang for the great experiences - looking forward to many more! Cheers!"
"Went to Gather last night with my inured sister from out of town.  I told her I had never been here before and didn't know what to expect.  The host took care of us and got use the the high seats in front of the kitchen, taking care of her crutches and promptly getting them when she asked for them mid meal.  The service was top notch.  The Good: We ordered the gathering plate which has some really good meats and cheeses, nuts, and jam and honeycomb on it.  It's $18 which might put off some people for an app, but it pairs amazingly with wine.  The liver pate was crazy good.We also ordered the Brussel sprouts which our waitress melissa had recommended.  I'm horrible with names especially when I am drinking and distracted with good food.  The brussel sprouts come with candied pistachios and a sauce from the gods and to top it off they put a sort of tuna cured (almost like bacon) that's so thinly sliced it disintegrates on your tongue    The cooks had an extra mussel order so they gave it to us.  It comes with a pretzel perfect for splitting and soaking up the sauce from the dish.  By this point we were both too full to even eat our meals.  I got the chicken which comes two ways, a breast broiled  seared on the stove and fried, both were cooked perfectly.  My sister got the steak and comes with another amazing sauce.  The Bad: NoneThis was the best meal/food/dining experience I've had in Chicago."
"I've been here twice and had a great experience both times. The first time I came in last minute with no reservation. It was a busy friday night, but we were able to get seats at the counter in front of the kitchen. We ordered a few dishes to share. The charcuterie plate was great and beautifully presented. Raviolo was perfect and not too filling. My friend ordered a chocolate bread pudding for dessert and loved it. The tomato salad was strange...not sure why bread puree is a thing. Combined with the tomatoes, the whole dish was texturally boring. I'm still all about 5-stars after watching these guys cook, however. THEY CRUSHED IT. We were there for probably about 1.5 hours and the kitchen (3 cooks) was slammed the entire time. They did a great job and were able to entertain the counter simultaneously. They've got some serious talent here! I will definitely be back."
"New favorite restaurant in Chicago!Exquisite menu, preparation, value and atmosphere. My wife and i found this little gem on Christmas Eve two years ago by driving around looking for something that was open - and what a great find! We prefer to sit at the counter watching the Chef and staff prepare - what an enjoyable experience. Awesome flavors, textures and freshness. Also, love love the unique ""mixology"" libation menu to boot...Highly recommend!"
"Wonderful place for food.  This is an amazing restaurant.  They make everything fresh, so if you have food allergies or gluten free- they can make something that you'll enjoy.  I love their food options, and can't wait to return.  Outside patio has a lovely atmosphere.  The rooms are separated enough so it doesn't get too loud.  It's a great place to bring family and friends visiting for the weekend.  Sunday nights they do family style dinners. Staff was warm and welcoming. They seemed to know the menu as well as their products used.  It's wonderful!"
"Gather is a short walk away from my boyfriend's place, so it'd been coming up on my Yelp and Foursquare apps for a while on the ""good restaurants near you"" lists. They only serve brunch on Sundays, in addition to their Sunday dinner (which I'm really hoping to come try out one day!)I took a quick peek at the menu this morning and the ""skillet"" jumped out at me immediately - potato topped with braised pork shoulder, a fried egg, avocado, cheese, black beans, and salsa. I don't think I've ever looked at a menu and wanted to order something from it that badly. All day the skillet was on my mind - I thought about it all throughout my morning bike ride.Other than the skillet, we ordered the home fries, a sticky bun, and the chicken fried biscuit. As it happened, the skillet ended up being probably my least favorite of the things we had - not because it wasn't good, but because everything else was great. The sticky bun was a surprising hit; usually cinnamon buns and similar pastries are way too sweet for my taste, but this one hit the spot and the glaze was perfect. The home fries were good as well - even better once I dipped them in the dregs of the butter and béchamel left over from the chicken biscuit. Yeah... fried things dipped in butter. I'm from the South. Don't give me that look.The skillet itself wasn't quite what I'd expected - I usually anticipate hash browns in a skillet, but these were just sliced up potatoes and were not crispy (i.e. not fried). The pork was awesome and the fried egg was perfectly crisp, but overall the dish was a little too watery and saucy for me - I'd ordered it anticipating crispy potatoes interspersed with pork, cheese, and avocado, and instead it was all kind of sitting in a soup and the avocado was more like avocado cream and yeah... basically just not quite what I had imagined. The chicken biscuit was phenomenal though - skin crisp, sauce amazing, perfect balance of sweet and savory.Atmosphere, service, etc were all great, no complaints. Really like this neighborhood and the ambiance in the restaurant is classy but not snooty - still feels like a cozy neighborhood cafe.I'll be back - hopefully to try out their Sunday dinner!"
"This place is phenomenal.  I had a rare evening without the kids, stopped here for dinner, and luckily chose to sit at the kitchen bar.  I have a culinary degree and was really happy to have the opportunity to see the 3-4 chefs preparing food for the hundred or so people eating at the restaurant the night I was there.  It was a little like watching the Coyote Ugly girls making drinks but in this case it was dudes making awesome food.  The Braised Short rib was amazingly tender and flavorful, try it!"
"Phenomenal dinner experience at Gather! Although we were late to make a reservation, we were told to come in before 6:30 and we could be seated. With a party of five, we easily grabbed a table on a Saturday night. Our waitress was extremely helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. To start, we went with cocktails, all of which were very well-crafted and tasty. I tried The Count and the Whiskey Smash, both of which I really enjoyed. Others at my table had the Manhattan, Negroni, and Pimm's Cup, you can't really go wrong. Gather's menu is interesting as it's broken down into shareable plates and regular entrees, but you can really mix and match whatever. We actually ordered a few of the sharing plates and also shared entrees.The whipped ricotta, which many reviews mention, is very delicious. I found it to be too sweet for me to have more than one piece of bread, but it's a good dish to share. Everyone was thoroughly impressed with the Gathering Board, Gather's charcuterie plate. I highly recommend this as every element was both unique and tasty. I also highly recommend ordering some of their veggies, specifically the carrots and the green beans, the smoked cashews and flavorful sauce on the green beans are on point. The spiced yogurt sauce on the carrots make this beyond better than your typical carrots. For our entrees, we shared the scallops, burger, tagliatelle, and chicken. Highlights were absolutely the chicken and burger, both were cooked perfectly and everyone loved them. Dessert included these apple fritters that were phenom. So warm and tasty, definitely recommend if you're not too full!Overall, Gather to me is an excellent place for dinner with parents. The ambiance is warm, crowd is a little older, the food is approachable but unique. It's definitely pricey, but you can tell everything is made exceptionally well and from scratch. Absolutely recommend Gather!"
"Came here for brunch yesterday and it was packed!  Fortunately we had a reservation and were seated at the counter where all the food was prepared.   I started with a peach bellini which was light and fresh.  My friend had a bloody mary -- had a great kick to it.We were given a complimentary donut which was perfect for sharing.  My friend and I shared the fried chicken and the french toast.  The fried chicken hit the spot!  The chicken was cooked to perfection, accompanied with homemade biscuit and potatoes, drizzled with gravy.  So freakin' good.  The french toast was very light and I absolutely loved the fresh whipped cream with raspberries.  The staff here is incredibly friendly and I loved the adorable space.  I look forward to coming back to try dinner!"
"I have never witnessed callous human disregard quite like I did here. I went here with my family on a Saturday. We had a reservation at 5 and arrived at 4:45. The doors were locked and it was 10 degrees with windchill around -20. First it was just us waiting. Then a couple with their baby showed up. After waiting ten minutes, we finally knocked on the door begging to come in, although the owner could see us the entire time.  He came over and refused to open the door further than a crack to inform us that he would not allow us to come in because they were discussing the menu. bottom line it was dangerous and disrespectful, I recommend you gather somewhere else.  We need to teach people like this a lesson"
"Yeah, this place is good. Pretty much what everyone said it would be."
"Gather is amazing! We went with a group of six. We shared appetizers that were delicious.  Get the brussel sprouts! I had the scallops for dinner.  I don't think I have ever had better anywhere.  We were there for a birthday so we ordered three desserts to share.  Do not skip dessert if you eat there! In fact going there just for dessert would not be strange at all.  They offer some of the best ever.  I'm a chocolate person, but their apple fritters may have changed me forever. There is a beautiful outdoor patio.  We sat indoors with our reservation.  Even though it was crowded, it was not too loud.  I have heard the brunch here is spectacular too. I hope to be back here soon and often."
"This near perfect little restaurant completely surprised me. Just across the street from the Old Town School of Folk Music, Gather looks like just any other Lincoln Square restaurant. Don't let the unassuming exterior underwhelm you: the food, interior and service are excellent.  Let's start with the interior. It's warm and modern with a deep turquoise blue and diamond wallpaper motif which finds its way from the walls to the menus to the software on the ipad mini at the host station. It's very buttoned up in that way. I even liked the great background music soundtrack. The tony ambience is carried through to a private covered outdoor patio in back with little lights in the conifer hedges surrounding the area. The clientele was well appointed and smart like the food and the atmosphere.Across from an open kitchen kept bustling all night with three chefs toiling away (where you can sit kitchenside to watch the prep) was a six stool cocktail and wine bar manned by a friendly mixologist/sommelier who also waited our table for the night. His special summer version of a manhattan made with aged rum, benedictine and dry vermouth was outstanding.The star of the night was the food. The menu had three sections of sharables, appetizers and entrees. We were encouraged to order everything at once. Two to three plates per person more than suffice. We sampled the delicious homemade whipped ricotta with local honey and balsamic drizzle on a crusty toasted baguette slice, which was a winner. Another amazing option was the asparagus salad with poached egg, red bliss potatoes, fresh dill and smoked salmon. The star sharable for us was a tie between the brussels sprouts with toasted pistachio, parmesan cheese, miso vinaigrette and bonito flakes, which were THE BEST brussels sprouts I've ever had. That's a very tall order coming from me, because my partner's homecooked brussel sprouts routinely kill any restaurant competition for tenderness, flavor and char. These had all of that plus a complexity from the other ingredients which took them to a whole 'nother level. The other delcious sharable side was the wagyu tartare with whole grain mustard, egg emulsion, cucumbers, capers served on a toasted homemade brioche. OMG, it was good.Two things we ordered that I assume must have been good were the uovo ravioli made with ricotta, sweet jalapeño, house-cured pancetta and white truffle butter and the duck confit made with fried egg, basil, creamy barley, duck jus and cracklings. They looked delicious, and I never got a taste because my dining partners just snarfed them up.  From the entrees we tried the half chicken seared breast, southern fried leg, king trumpet mushroom and creamy polenta. That fried chicken leg set a new standard for amazing flavor. I had the diver scallops with roasted + pureed beet, spatzle, guanciale, candied orange and brown butter crumble.  A. May. Zing. That's all I will say. Order it.Two misses on the menu were the steamed mussels with white wine, garlic, cannellini bean, kale and grilled country bread. The mussels were small. The comment on that dish was it was a lot of work for not a lot of payoff. Lastly, for the gnocchi with octopus, puttanesca, salsa verde, fried caper and fennel, there wasn't enough flavor variation nor texture to the dish to push it to the level of the other items. These two things weren't bad, mind you, just kind of meh in comparison.Two things I think I'd try next time were the charcuterie plate, which two could easily share for a light dinner with some wine. They were also sending out a lot of their burgers (many split in half orders) with white cheddar, house smoked bacon, caramelized onion, red pepper aïoli on a brioche with fries.The service was friendly, professional and not rushed to the point of coming off a little slow, I'd say. The place was bustling on a Wednesday night and everybody was hustling just to keep up.  My review is more of a 4.5. This place is really good, nearly perfect. I'm definitely going back, maybe for a Sunday brunch or one of their $26 per person Sunday evening family style dinners."
"Went to Gather for my birthday with two friends on Friday for a 6:30 reservation.  Busy little place but it was really pretty inside with nice lighting.   Really comfortable booth.My one friend got a lovely glass of white wine while my other friend and I each ordered the Overnight Sensation cocktail which was actually really nice (I thought it would be too sweet possibly but it was balanced).We shared the ricotta honey plate and it was delicious.  The bread was toasted perfectly and super buttery.  The ricotta and honey was so creamy and delicious.The portion was great too, the three of us got our fill.One friend ordered the cod and she loved it.  The other ordered the Tagliatelle pasta which she really enjoyed.  I got the burger and it was big, juicy and flavorful.  Very good.We split the chocolate ice cream thing that was on special for dessert.  That was the only low point of the meal - while chocolatey the ice cream was rock hard.  We had to really hack at it, though that obviously didn't stop us from eating it.Overall though we enjoyed the meal very much - our server was great as well."
"I meet up here with a friend for brunch and it was a delightful experience.  They have plenty of vegetarian options which makes things very easy.  I ended up going with the Benedict, which is a breakfast staple of mine that I usually go for.  After looking at what came out of the kitchen (thanks to the counter seats) I wished I would have gone for the chicken and biscuits option.   That aside I will have to admit I was still very satisfied with my meal.One of my eggs was slightly overcooked, not to the degree that I got upset about it but it was slightly over.  I do like the use of the thin sliced ham in the place of the Canadian bacon.  The bits of bacon over the top made the salt content absolutely perfect.I also got to taste a bit of my friends pork belly-free breakfast skillet.  It was really good and the salsa was brilliant and added a nice acidity that I think would have went perfectly with the fatty pork belly.  Yet and still you could tell that it was a substantial and satisfying dish."
This place blew me away. The quality of the food and drinks is just outstanding and the service was so friendly and knowledgeable. The only downside is the price. BUT you pay for what you get. Some of the best food in Chicago with inventive drinks and fun friendly service! This place is a must try!
"We made a reservation and arrived at Gather around 7 p.m. on a Sunday evening. We tried the Sunday night family-style dinner. This included our choice of 3 out of 6 entree options (salad, fried chicken, pasta, flat bread, pulled pork with risotto, and vegetables), sides of mashed potatoes and broccoli, and a dessert. The servings are portioned out according to the number in your party. There was truly plenty of food for our party of two!We opted for the salad, fried chicken, and pulled pork risotto. The salad was the least exciting of our picks, but it was still a good light and refreshing start to the meal. The fried chicken with coleslaw and the pulled pork over risotto were both amazing. You can tell ingredients are fresh and well-prepared. Dessert was a cinnamon bun which was the perfect size and melt in your mouth goodness. The price was $26 per person, which I thought was good for the amount and quality of food. I would definitely recommend this as a terrific place for a good meal or date night!"
"Just came in for dessert with my son. Can't say enough good things! Some places kind of look down on you for a smaller check, but there was never a feeling that we were unwelcome. Quite the contrary, in fact. Service was spectacular, dessert was amazing! We'll be back for dinner. Highly, highly recommend! I don't normally Yelp, but  they are worthy of high praise!"
"Mmmmmmmm.  We had a great meal here.Started with steak tartare (YUM) and the ricotta with clover honey and balsamic.  That ricotta dish... let me tell you.  It was AMAZING.  I will dream about that little snack forever.We also had the farm special which was great.  We split eh short rib entree, which was also delicious if not a little small, portion wise.  My fiance started off with a cocktail (whiskey smash) that was great.  I had some wine and was very happy with it.My only negative was that we were seated in the ""tasting room"" which is just a jazzed up way to explain the through-way between the patio and the dining room.  The tables were too high and too big, which coupled with the space made for a difficult ambiance to enjoy a conversation.  Next time I will ask to be seated either outside in the patio area or in the regular dining room.  Food is amazing, though!"
"Three of us went here for a Wednesday night dinner.  Warm & welcoming space.  Comfortable seating.  Overall great service.  Now to the food.  Farm to table.  Organic.  Delicious.  Every single item we ordered did not disappoint.  In fact the fall dip was so good my husband ordered a second that we ate w our entrees.  We did the ricotta dip and cauliflower to start in addition to the fall dip.  Cauliflower was delish but quite spicy.  Of all the things we had it was the least fave so a 4/5.  Everything else was a 5.  For entrees, 2 of us had the scallops and licked our plates clean.  Perfectly cooked w a crispy sear.  Yum! My hubs had the short rib and also cleaned his plate! He stated that every component of his dish was full of flavor.  For dessert we shared the apple fritters.  Crispy balls of perfectly balanced sweetness. We were all VERY PLEASED with our deliciously memorable dining experience at Gather.  We will return :)"
"This is the best brunch I've had in Chicago. Start with sticky bun.Move on to fried chicken and biscuitsEnd with French toast. On a side note, the servers were amazing and the owner happened to be there and was very nice. Awesome experience."
"Long overdue review. I have now been here 2x once for dinner, back in October, and again yesterday for brunch. Enjoyable, Delicious, and just a great experience. October dinner we started with a seasonal gnocchi with an entrée of their pork chop, which garnered an audible ""this is so good"". Our table was outside on a rainy night but their patio is enclosed and we did not get wet. Sitting their candle lit, rain falling out side... what a nice birthday dinner with the girl. Yesterday popped in for brunch with no reservation but hit at the right time where there was no wait. It was a tad loud, but that was purely due to a group of friends enjoying a wonderful Sunday. Seated and were attended too right away. As it was a new menu for us to peruse our server suggested we split a sticky bun with our coffee, warm cinnamon sugary delight. My choice was their new variation of the skillet, so new I see they have not updated their web site yet. Braised pork belly, Yukon gold potato, cheddar, salsa, egg on top with a spoonful of guacamole... so good. Girl had the Sunday Omelete, she offered a bite to me, which was a quite delicious. Portions are good, ambiance is warm and friendly, all around a great experience. Looking forward to giving their family style Sunday dinner a whirl."
"The first time I came to Gather, I wasn't a fan at all. When I returned a second and third time, they made up for the lousy first impression. The food here is great and service matches. It's a bit pricey but the food is much higher quality and you can taste it. My only complaint is the limited menu. I feel it could use a few more options."
"The best omelette ever!! Everything is so perfect. You have not had a better meal in Chicago. I had the chicken and biscuits...dear God! Amazing!  If you go with a friend, try sitting at the bar so you can see the magic! Jeremy and team were great!  They were charming and fun!  So fun to watch."
"Hidden Gem, in the heart of Lincoln square. Great service, food, atmosphere. Lunch, dinner or Brunch. Always consistent! Can't wait to go back and try more. Some outstanding things in the bench menu was the pork belly and fried chicken sandwich. For dinner the steak tartar and risotto!"
"Gather!  I really wanted to write a great review, but my last experience was so ""meh"" that I'm afraid I can't.  In full disclosure- I ate at Gather last spring, and it was fantastic.  Everything was great, and I was excited to go back.  This experience was less-than-fantastic.I got a drink at Gather a few weeks ago, and the experience was...so-so.  I asked the waitress about the white wines on the list, and she answer was kind of rude.  I asked if a certain white whine was dry like French wines from the Bordeaux region.  (It is not a hard and fast rule that all whites from the Bordeaux region are dry, but they do tend to be.  Further, the French *pride* themselves in having wine that would be considered dry.)  Her answer was, ""Well, I don't know.  France has a lot of different kind of white wine.""   It seemed as if she was put-off by my question, didn't know the answer and she became defensive.    She did, however, seem especially interested in suggesting a wine that went well with my date's dinner and proceeded to ask him, quite a few times, about his meal and the quality of her ""pairing"".  The attitude really rubbed me the wrong way, and I don't think I will go back."
"Trendy little place in the awesome Lincoln square neighborhood.  The flavors were delicious, the presentations were pretty, but the portions were small. I'll be back for drinks at the wine bar, but that's it."
"The food was great, but the incompetency of the service was, eventually, inexcusable.  It's the first time my sister and her husband are meeting my boyfriend.  We had a reservation for 7:30 on a Wednesday.  I walk in two minutes early to find a mostly empty restaurant, and was seated at the patio, assured by the host that he would ""make sure the rest of your party joins you when they arrive.""  I sit by myself for over twenty minutes, my texts to my the rest of my party unacknowledged.  The staff repeatedly approaches me with pity to ask about getting me a drink or anything at all.My family and boyfriend finally walk out to the patio.  At that moment, they receive all of my texts.  No cell service inside, I guess, where they'd been waiting at the bar for 20 minutes, having been told by the host, about a minute after he seated me, that I had not yet arrived!!!  My suggestion if you can't keep track of your guests in a mostly empty restaurant:  use a pencil.The host accompanies them on their search for me, but hangs back when my party finds me and make their way to the table.  I catch his eye, and raise my eyebrows.  He immediately dodges back to the front of the restaurant.  So no apology, then?The staff brings my family's drinks to them from the bar.  Later, our server explains my BIL's drink was actually another patron's.  She does apologize.  My BIL hadn't questioned the mystery drink, assuming my sister had ordered on his behalf.  The server comps the drink -- well, obviously, since we didn't order it.At the end of the night, after paying, we discover from our server that we've been brought the wrong bill.  She is again apologetic.  They have to void the credit cards, and bring us OUR bill to be paid.  Apparently, another party is doing this at the same time, having been brought the bill for our dinner & drinks.In sum, although we didn't receive all the apologies we were owed, I would really just prefer service that needs no apology!  I left the place completely disgusted.  In the future, we will take our patronage elsewhere."
"This place really doesn't need another 5-star review, but I can't help myself. Everything about Gather was perfect from start to finish. We were only able to snag a 9:00 reservation on a Saturday, which is a little late for us, but well worth it in the end. From start to finish, this place nailed it. The host was polite and efficient, our server was helpful and paced our meal wonderfully. My date and I shared several items so we could get a taste of everything. We had the gnocchi, brussels sprouts (omg), sweet potato soup and the burger. Everything was fantastic, but seriously, those brussels sprouts...I'm still thinking about them 2 weeks later. Who would have thought that was possible for a little green vegetable. Get it. Just get it. We finished off with the apple fritter dessert  - the best way to end a perfect meal. Warm apple-y goodness. All that food came out to about $55 bucks. What a DEAL! I can't wait to go back!"
"I'm not a huge fan of ""brunch"" maybe because I haven't had anything that particularly impressed me. Until today. This restaurant was perfect from beginning to end. Had the best seat in restaurant. This was more than just amazing flavorful food. This was an experience. I was speechless! And if you really know me. I ALWAYS have something to say. I will be back for dinner and brunch again."
"Problem: total lack of regard or sympathy from the host for failing to honor a reservation made 2 weeks in advance. [table for 2; 7:30pm, 3/27/15]Upon prompt arrival on the evening of the reservation, I and my partner could see the restaurant was packed with patrons whom I am ""sure"" had all also made their reservations 2 weeks beforehand. We were not pleased to find out the table being offered to honor a reservation made 14 days prior, was a very, very small table for one crammed tight between an extremely loud and boisterous dinner party [8 or more people] and the front window. It was so loud in the room that to be understood by the host, we had to yell in order to ask if there were a quieter, less confined area to be seated. The host apathetically replied no, but he could fit us somewhere at the busy bar. That was it. No apologies. Nothing. Take it or leave it. We declined and left and probably won't be back. Shame too because we like the food there.It's understood that ""things"" happen and sometimes a restaurant can't fulfill reservations in a satisfactory manner- but to have a cold, nonchalant attitude towards a patron when failing to do so shows an utter disregard and lack of respect for their customers.  TW"
"Loved my dinner at Gather last night. The seats overlooking the kitchen were a treat- great conversation with the Chefs and a live show in addition to dinner. The food was amazing- we had the artichokes, green beans, whipped ricotta, ramp pasta and tuna. All was delicious and such a great mix of flavors. As a resident of the neighborhood, I will definitely make this a regular in my rotation. Don't miss it!"
"One word.  Phenomenal.  My siblings and I went for a Thursday night dinner here last night and the night made me reevaluate every 5 star restaurant review I have ever given.  This is the true five star dining experience.  We sat in the back patio, which is both comfortable and beautiful.  The service was fine, but the food was shining star.  I am still dreaming about the ricotta spread.  It is ridiculously good.   The raviolo was also equally complex and delicious.  We split it three ways and pretty much licked the place clean.  I would get this again every time.  Next, we order the brussel sprouts, which was a favorite of everyone at the table.  I dont know how they took brussel sprouts and made them so freaking damn good, but they are everything all the reviews say about them.  Next, we ordered the chicken.  I laughed at my brother when he even suggested this.  Chicken?  How good can chicken be?  I've had chicken at least 3 days a week for like the past 20 years... chicken???!!!  But, when the waiter described it, he had me sold to at least try it.  This turned out to be the best damn chicken I ever had.  Like seriously, I'll never look at chicken the same.  Our only disappointment of the night was the mussels.  The pretzel roll  that came with them was good and an interesting addition to a classic, but the flavor was just.... good.  After everything else blew us away, the mussels kind of just sat on the table and we all went back to the other dishes.  All in all, this place is a gem.  I am already planning my next trip back for brunch."
"I went to gather with my boyfriend's family after his brother had been raving about it for weeks and weeks. I wanted to leave as obsessed as he is. And it was good, but it was hyped up WAY too much. Someone used the words ""future michelin star restaurant"" and honestly, I doubt that, though it will hopefully stay in business for a long long time and do well, especially with the great location.We ate a lot of things. Between the five of us, we ordered: cocktails, brussels sprouts, mushroom risotto, steak tartare, mussels, the burger, the scallops, the half chicken, the pasta, the salmon, and three desserts: pumpkin cheesecake, apple fritter, and some raspberry tart thing.The cocktails were PHENOMENAL. If all you do it sit at the bar and drink, do it. I can't say enough good things. Perfectly mixed, unique and new combinations, lots of flavor, not overly strong but certainly not weak.... A+ to the bartender. The sprouts were my favorite part of the meal. Hands down. Get them. Mushroom risotto was also out of this world and highly recommended.The mussel dish was delicious, but the mussels themselves were teeny tiny. I'd recommend this dish only when it is mussel season, because I just wanted more of the seafood with that sauce.I was probably most excited about the steak tartare, since it's my all time favorite food. Unfortunately I didn't love it. There was something pickled mixed in which was weird, and it was served with a brioche bread, so the sweet and the pickled mixed together, not to mention the soft texture, was just not my thing. When I put the tartare on the grilled bread they brought out for the mussels it was better, but I still didn't love the pickle element. Oh well.The scallops and pasta were great. I only took a bite but enjoyed both. My burger was perfectly cooked but sweeter than I expected it to be - I think because of the raspberry aioli or something. It wasn't my favorite, because i really wanted just a plain ol' burger, but the rest of my table enjoyed finishing it on my behalf. The fries that it came with were fantastic.Then the desserts. Oh, the desserts. They were amazing. I don't like cheesecake because I don't like cream cheese, but the pumpkin cheesecake blew me away. It tasted like real pumpkin, not at all cream cheesy, and great texture. The tart was good as well. The apple fritter was more like a funnel cake and I didn't taste any apple, but honestly, how can anyone go wrong with fried dough?The service was superb. The staff knew the regulars and gave out complimentary desserts to them, made conversation, were prompt and courteous and knowledgeable. Can't say enough good things. My only real gripes are that it was so loud I couldn't hear what the person two seats away from me was saying, and that the temperature fluctuated greatly between tundra and earth's core. Go to Gather. Enjoy Gather. Get the Sprouts."
"I'd give 4.5 stars if I could. Only issue was an incredibly slow bar! We waited for our drinks every time for an unusual period. BUT talk about yummy! A friend and I enjoyed their perfect patio (surprisingly private and intimate lighting. We shared four apps...LOVE the Brussels sprouts in miso aioli! Whipped risotto was delicious and the ravioli in white truffle sauce was tasty. Friend thought mussels were ""ok"" but in defense had just had them in boston! So, overall a great experience for a girls night out!"
"Everything about this restaurant will make you keep coming back! The stuff is very well trained and customer service is a pleasure. In fact they go above and beyond to make you fell welcome. The ambiance is great too, perfect lighting and decor is modern, but warm. The menu changes often with some staples that remain from month to month. Overall you can't go wrong with anything! We have eaten there several times and never had a bad dish. You can sit at the chef's table and watch them work in the kitchen which is a lot of fun."
"Amazing place!  Started the night with some really great cocktails at the bar while we waited for the table, interesting drinks and great fresh ingredients.  While we had a reservation, we still ended up waiting about 45 minutes which can be a little tricky in the tight bar area, but as soon as we were seated they brought over complimentary brussel sprouts and apologized for the wait.  Totally appreciated that and this dish was delicious!  The rest of the dinner was just as good, just really delicious food, great service and atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back when the weather warms up and try out the patio!"
"First time we went to brunch and it was awesome!! I ordered the fried chicken and biscuits, and they ran out of biscuits, bumm, bumm, bumm! Now what? Well our server Jamie, second time she's been our server, recommend I sub in pancakes. It was great, sweet and savory to perfection. Perfect combo of crunchy and cakey. Thank you again Jamie for suggestion, excellent service. I would love to have her as my server every time, she truly has a great sense and love of food. What's better here the food or the service? Not sure, but both are great. Go here!"
"Went to Gather again for a birthday. We sat on the patio in the back. Considering it's October, it was a great atmosphere. I started with a manhattan and my boyfriend had the count. Manhattan was just right and the count was good, too. Next came the gathering board. I love charcuterie and this was great. The only negative thing about the board is that is doesn't come with enough bread. I wouldn't ever ask for extra bread but the waitress asked if we wanted extra bread. This also happened last time. Maybe gather should rethink the amount of bread on the board. Next I ordered the Pinot Gris, which was nice. It was like an Alsatian wine. Boyfriend had the Pinot noir which was nice. Maybe a little warm. Dinner for me was the pasta dish. Fab. Loved it. The egg yolk made it rich but didn't make me wanna throw up. Boyfriend had the sirloin. It was also so good. I really love the food at gather. Now at the end of the meal, we didn't ever get our leftover food because the busboy threw it away. The waitress fixed it by sending us home with some fresh food. Overall, service was just a touch slow, but Emily was busy. Nothing negative to say about her."
"Going down hill?? I really hope this isn't the case... I have been going to Gather with my husband since it opened and for the most part it's been great. We really love good food and were super excited the first couple times we came here. They have amazing Moscow Mules and typically you can't go wrong with any of their appetizers, especially the Whipped Ricotta - absolutely delish.  Anytime we come here with friends, we would always recommend the burger or the half-chicken... especially the half-chicken. SO good - the plate has a couple nice pieces of fried chicken and some seared chicken and plenty of polenta. However, the last time we went, we ordered the chicken and something totally different came out than usual. The pieces of chicken were not nearly as good... usually you get an amazing piece of fried chicken and this time it was a tiny wing that had nothing on it. The portion of it seemed to have gone down by about half overall, including the polenta, which usually has a couple good heapings, was more of a garnish on the bottom of the plate. It also looked at if it was thrown onto one side of the plate.. really weird. It looked like more of an appetizer. So disappointing after explaining it to our friends. I'm just over restaurants doing things well and then changing them for the worse. I don't know if it was to save money or we just got an off-night plate but I really hope it was just that night and not something they are sticking with."
Sunday they have family style and it is the most amazing experience. Renowned chef food with expansive portions. Fantastic The salad was like sunshine --bright lemon vinaigrette and brussels sprouts like everyone tries to make them. That's not even talking about the entrée or the service!.
"I really wanted to rate excellent, but the casual service was a killer.Great atmosphere, art, and chic bathrooms were a stand out.  The skillet was perfect and flavorful, coffee great, and Benedict was perfect.  One person brought water, another took our drink order, then our server took our drink order... After twenty minutes we finally had our coffee and bloody marys."
"Have been here a number of times and must say was never disappointed. Very attentive service and very delicately cooked meals. Anything really you choose here is good. The menu isn't too big, but what they have they cook skillfully. The menu also changes with season. Good selection of wines. I would always recommend Gather as a safe option for a good dinner. For frequent customers they sometimes do free deserts or additional meal for free. They obviously value their guests."
"Every item on their menu was amazing! We tried the ricotta spread, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts to begin with and each dish was cooked well with very unique - and yummy - flavors! I then had the raviolo, ending with the cheesecake for dessert. I was celebrating my best friend's bday, do they brought out a little candle in the cheesecake. Service was generally good. Ambiance very cute! Great date spot!"
"We stopped in here for Easter Brunch and had a blast. This place was a hike from our normal neighborhood, but well worth it. Please is not pretentious, a comfortable setting and great back patio. Did I say we loved the back patio?Short review: Great atmosphere, fun staff, inviting filling delicious food.  We will head back again to try their more traditional dinner menu. Our Easter brunch experience was fun. As part of their special holiday menu they brought out an assortment of pastries for the table to share. There were sticky buns, scones and a tart. Oh man, next time I will be ordering the sticky bun again.  We then were able to order off the main brunch menu. Our entire table ordered the Sunday Omelet. It was a close call between the omelet, corn cakes and skillet. We were all delighted with the omelet. It had just the right amount of cheese, not too big but maybe too much spinach for me (enough with the healthy stuff!). Then they brought out a small meat board for the table. One person at our table didn't eat meat so it was up to the two of us to clear the board. After the previous courses this was hard to do, but not too hard, as the meat was delicious. It included bacon and pork sausage that was soft, sweet and tender.We were so stuffed but had a great time. We were so comfortable we sat and talked for a good hour after our meal. I apologize to the waitress for tying up her table for so long. I cannot wait to head back again for dinner."
"Second trip - this time for lunch.Another good experience due to the food. The big drawback: service is slooooow. I attribute this to having only three chefs in the kitchen. I don't mind waiting for food for this reason, but they need to really polish up their beverage service. I should not wait 30 mins to give my drink order and another 15 to get it. Mind you, the servers are VERY pleasant. BUT, I'm impressed with the food and atmosphere."
"Only went for wine and apps but the selection looked good and the wine was reasonably priced. Reminded me of the purple pig with there use of interesting appetizers that we shared. Definitely a nicer place for just the adults, kids would probably be seen as a distraction."
"Outstanding.  This evening we sat on the back porch.  Temp outside was in the 50's and with the covered roof, heaters, and string lights was just spectacular."
"Gather is always amazing, go for the ricotta app, it's amazing. Moody atmosphere with an incredible drink selection to go along with the great food."
"Super cute decor, pretty good food, and very mediocre service.  The lighting and wallpaper gives this place a certain unique look.  The salmon bruschetta (or something like that) was delicious.  In fact I liked all my food!  Plus I love my gin drinks and they made mine with perfection!  It was called ""Summertime"".The one thing that really threw me off was the service.  Our server was in training and had this girl following him around the whole time.  For some reason they switched roles and the girl became our server instead (a bit confusing).  Once they traded positions we were somewhat neglected. She took our water bottle and then didn't return with a new one for 30 minutes. My boyfriend ordered a beer and they completely forgot.  Then we ordered dessert. After waiting 20 minutes the server in training came up to us to confirm out dessert order (meaning she forgot again).  The apple fritter was a bit burnt.If the service would have been good, this place would have received 4 stars.  I think they could do a bit more with the entrees (more flavor). But otherwise, I'd recommend this place."
"NON-BRUNCH REVIEW...I hate to be the wet blanket on the Gather-palooza here, but this meal was nothing memorable. We had high hopes going in based on word of mouth and reviews, but we left pretty disappointed.There were three of us and we started with a round of cocktails. They were good, but obnoxiously small (think large shot rather than full cocktail).We ordered two appetizers: the brussels sprouts and the whipped ricotta. The whipped ricotta was delicious. In hindisght, it's kinda sad that toast and ricotta was the best thing we had (even though it could have used some pepper). The brussels sprouts were so salty we could barely stomach another bite. And I don't think our dish was a fluke -- another table came in about 30 minutes after us and ordered the sprouts and they too were visibly gagging on salt.We each ordered an entree: short rib, tagliatelle and scallops. The short rib had a nice glaze/crust thing going on on the outside, but the interior was a bit dry and didn't have that fall-apart succulence you expect from braised short rib (a knife was repeatedly needed to cut it apart). The pasta was also overly salted, yet still managed to be bland. By all accounts the diver scallops were good, but a rather meager portion. That could be said of all the entrees: they were sized more like small plates than entrees. Small plates are fine, but you shouldn't be calling them entrees (and charging entree prices).Gather is a lovely space in a great part of town, but the menu and execution could use some work. It seems like a lot of the raves for Gather are related to the brunch and Sunday supper. I'd be willing to try it again for one of those two meals, but there is no need to do a ""regular"" dinner there."
"We went to gather for my husbands birthday, it had amazing food and service! I had made reservations a week in advance and we still had a 45 min wait, but I have to say it was so worth it. They made up for us having to wait so long by giving us 4 FREE APPS!! It was delicious and great portion size and also quality."
"Had an absolutely stellar experience at Gather last night.I had visited once prior with a friend, and I came home ranting about the food so much that my husband made reservations for our anniversary. We were absolutely blown away. We requested to sit at one of 6 seats facing the kitchen (we dropped that it was our anniversary and they could not have been more kind/accomodating), and the only thing that was better than the food was the service.We ordered the crunchy brussell sprouts with benito flakes (best in the city, and must be their most popular dish because we saw dozens going out of the kitchen), the raviolo, the cod, and the tagiatelle-- all delicious, fresh, and seasonal. Seeing the chefs prepare the food was such a treat- dinner and a show!Our waiter, Ryan, was thorough, patient, and funny. The chef himself dropped off two complimentary tasting plates and congratulated us on our anniversary, and no less than two managers came by to say the same.All in all, an absolutely stellar experience and we will be back!"
"I went here on a Saturday night for dinner with some girlfriends. We had a 7:30 reservation. The place was crowded and we weren't seated until almost 8. That would have been super annoying, but the manager kept apologizing to us for the wait. He also sent over a complimentary Whipped Ricotta appetizer for the table as soon as we were seated as an apology, which was super classy (and unbelievably delicious). That set the tone for what ended up being a really great night. We opted to share several appetizers and each get an individual entree. For apps, I sampled the Grilled Octopus, Steak Tartare, and Apple Salad: all outstanding. I opted for the Braised Short Ribs as my entree, which were perfect: so flavorful and tender. We shared the Apple Fritter dessert, which was heavenly and a generous portion size (actually, all the portion sizes were pretty large). I also enjoyed several (okay, five) delicious cocktails, the Overnight Sensation being my favorite. Overall, this was a practically perfect dining experience. The food was amazing, the staff were all efficient and super friendly, and the restaurant ambiance is great: modern but not at all pretentious. Also, all things considered, the pricing at Gather is very reasonable and more affordable than most other upscale Chicago restaurants. I definitely recommend this place. Make sure you make a reservation beforehand, because it was packed the whole night: and with good reason. Gather is awesome!"
"Found out about Gather and its Sunday family dinners on Yelp last week when my boo and I took our parents out for a casual but celebratory evening.  5 stars for atmosphere!  It was a warm night and we sat on the back patio which I was sold on immediately with the string lights and greenery.  5 stars for service!  Attentive but not too attentive.  Friendly people.5 stars for food - for the Sunday dinner you pick three items from an entree list.  We chose the mushroom tagliatelle, an arugula salad, and boneless fried chicken.  The pasta was rich and truffley (and homemade!!  I haven't had fresh pasta in a long time and this was the perfect reintroduction!), and the chicken was SO good, crispy, a perfect balance of sweet and salty, juicy, and tender.  I normally wouldn't jump at fried chicken, especially at a nicer place like this, but I'm glad we took our server's suggestion.Only complaints - for $26/person, I think there should have been more food.  I'm not sure how they dish up the portions based on table size, but the amount of food we received for a party of 5 adults seemed more suited for a party of 3 or 4. Also, and I can't believe I'm saying this, but the music - awkward! The top 40 dance party tunes just didn't fit the classy dinner atmosphere at all.  It was a distraction /=I will be back."
"What an amazing time and experience. Great vibe and trendy little spot. Open 'chefs table' (sits like a bar) with an open view to the chef's preparing and cooking. The food....Top Notch!!!  My girlfriend and I went in to give this place a try. The menu online looked good enough to go. We haven't had very many successful meals but this was a home run from start to finish. We opted to do two shared plates and two appetizers, asking out server to send them out one by one in an order that would make sense for us trying new items. To start we had the Whipped Ricotta (house made ricotta, clover honey, balsamic, toasted baguette) which was sweet and savory and just a terrific way to get our stomachs anticipating what was to come. Also this is a great starter for a small party if people. The next plate we were presented with was the Uovo Raviolo (ricotta, sweet jalapeño, house-cured pancetta, white truffle butter). This is a MUST order!! Absolutely succulent. Had we not have ordered two other plates, we would have ordered a second of this. Great to share with another person. Moving onto the next plate was their Crispy Pork Belly (watermelon cube, soy glaze, serrano, sesame seed). I have never had pork belly before and I'm glad I waited to try it here first!! Nailed it!!  The combo of pork belly with fresh sliced watermelon and the soy glaze was heaven. We wrapped up the meal with the Steak Tartare (wagyu, egg emulsion, cucumber, caper, homemade brioche). Holy smokes batman...that's some amazing stuff!!! Despite being full to capacity, we decided to sip a little more wine before ordering a dessert, which was a delicious pana cotta. Smooth. Silky. Fresh blueberries with a blueberry glaze. Incredible. The best experience and meal we've had in a long time. I should also mention the staff and how attentive, helpful and friendly they were. Top notch Gather. Top notch!"
"Gather, where do I begin?  Its the day after, I am reviewing the photos I took of my meal and still salivating.The atmosphere was fantastic; warm, inviting and casual...but not too casual.  We sat at the chefs table, appropriately facing the kitchen.  Not your typical chefs table, when I say 'facing the kitchen'  I mean I felt like the cooks became part of my family.  I highly recommend sitting here if you have the chance.The food was delectable.  The portion size, flavor, presentation; all exquisite.  We started with the whipped ricotta, highly recommend.  Great flavor, perfect for sharing.  We moved on to the steak tartar.  Again, an explosion of flavor, fabulous texture and just the right amount.  From here, we transitioned to the asparagus salad and braised short rib.I don't know how, but Gather managed to make each plate uniquely amazing.  The asparagus salad was accompanied by salmon and a poached egg. The combination provided just enough separation in flavors to leave me yearning for the next bite.The braised short rib...come on.  So tender, so delicious.  It was like a flower blossoming in spring.  With each passing moment, you know that something even more spectacular lies ahead.  With each bite, my excitement could be compared to your first hole in one...or that first time you could get rim on a 10 foot hoop.  I cant even...Lets talk about the staff for a moment.  Scott, I cannot praise your dedication and welcoming personality enough.  Your recommendations were spot on, your timing; impeccable.   We thoroughly appreciated each and every time you came to check on us.  Truth be told, the entire staff, from the kitchen to the bar, worked like a well oiled machine.  They complimented each other so well.  All these attributes combined, created a fantastic Wednesday evening dining experience that left me planning my next trip back.Solid work Gather *fist bump*"
"Yum, yum, and yum.... Grilled asparagas, crispy broccoli sprouts, and ramp tagliatelle with smoked chicken. Unique flavors, fresh ingredients, and fantastic service. I can't wait to go back!"
This place is awesome! Amazing food and the staff is super friendly! Get the cinnamon roll!! It is a must!
"I had brunch here and ordered an omelette which came with potatoes. The omelette was pretty standard and the potatoes were wonderfully seasoned and crispy. Despite enjoying the food, I wasn't happy with the service. We made a reservation and had to wait a little bit. That was fine because the manager consistently came by and gave us updates on how much longer we had to wait. However when we sat down, our waitress didn't acknowledge us for a least a couple of minutes. I understand that brunch is a busy time, but just being told a simple ""I'll be with you soon"" would've been nice. Instead, we just sat for a few minutes before the waitress even spoke to us."
"I will start by saying that I really want to love gather. It is in my neighborhood and the decor and feel are great. The small plate menu and entrees are right up my alley. The wait staff is friendly and more than provides proper service. This three star rating is based on Gather trying to redeem themselves from a miserable experience I had with several girlfriends there on Friday night. We had 8:45 reservations. Two of us were there right on time but the third didn't arrive until about 9:00. It was obvious that tables weren't turning over-we all understand that happens. What was super frustrating was the fact that even though the front of the house was aware of the fact that we were waiting, we were pretty much ignored the entire time. It wasn't until 9:45-a full hour after our reservation-that we pulled the front manager aside and said that we wanted to order that we were offered a menu or water or anything beyond the initial bottle of wine we received from the bar. Super frustrating! It made us feel invisible, not a way you want your guests to feel. By the end of the night, we had received a bunch of free food/drinks which was appreciated and had a very attentive waiter. It was all very good but we wanted to pay for our food. We wanted to be seated. At 8:45 or 9:00, not 10:00. :) cod was awesome though."
"Brunch here was outstanding. It was our cheat day, and we went all out.Started with the Cinnamon roll and Donut. Both were great, but the Cinnamon roll was the winner. We shared the Corn Griddle Cake and Pork Belly, and the Breakfast Club. The Corn cakes, with creamy Polenta and succulent Pork Belly, Wow.A Decadently delicious meal.We ordered a side of sausage (more like a Kilbasa) and we didn't need to.It came with the Breakfast Club, I wish our waitress had told us.Overall the service was good, and we were greeted warmly by the host.I will be back!"
"Honestly...I can't get enough of this place.  We just went to the Farm Dinner last week and it was a HUGE success.  Lovely staff, great ambiance and delicious food.  What more can you ask for???  I literally feel welcomed every time I come in...I think it is part of the concept of the restaurant and they're definitely living up to it. I highly recommend.  For pictures and more details see my blog post!  :) thetravelingfoodster.com…"
"A phenomenal place. Service was excellant, our server Jamie took 5 star care. The food was eclectic, a perfect amount of food. Must try the Brussels sprouts, rissoto, and to drink Autumn Serenade"
"WOW!  My daughter suggested Gather tonight. She balked at the 5:30 reservation, but the restaurant filled up quickly, so we were happy to beat the crowd The food was outstanding!  We started with the whipped ricotta with clover honey and balsamic. Oh my goodness,,,it was fantastic The crispy bread came buttered and warm,,,soft on the inside. Such a treat. Our waitress, noticing we had eaten all the bread and had some ricotta left over, asked if we wanted more bread That was really appreciated! The worst thing is to be served spreads or pate, with 2 tiny pieces of bread Applause for an ample amount of ricotta and bread ratio!I had the chicken..which was sublime. It was so moist and tender. I did not leave one morsel on the plate. My daughter had the hamburger. She said it was juicy without being greasy, the bacon was amazing and the cheese just right....the onions added just a little hint of sweetness.Oh, by the way, the bartender made a wonderful vodka gimlet!The restaurant is small and the tables are a smidge close together. It was not a problem for us, especially when the food was so good. An added perk is an open kitchen.It was a throughly enjoyable meal and dining experience."
"Brunch at Gather is as good as it gets! Unlike most brunch places, Gather takes reservations. That doesn't stop people from waiting outside to get a table. It is a smaller restaurant that gets pretty loud when full. Their menu is limited yet appealing. Everything looks good. We started with a round of Mimosas and the Sticky Bun. The Mimosa was perfectly balanced and a perfect afternoon drink. I ordered the Chicken and Waffle dish with a side of Home Fries. I was impressed with everything placed in front of me. I loved the syrup on the chicken. Ultimately, what made this a five star experience was the service. Our waitress was attentive and worked to make this a great dining experience. When she found out one of our members was celebrating a birthday she put a candle on the sticky bun. Next to us were two people whose third person showed up midway through their meal. They were sitting at a two top and the third crowded into our space. Our waitress realized this was affecting our experience and moved them to another table. I will be back many times and would love to try this place for dinner sometime soon."
"Sunday Brunch:Great small/mid-sized restaurant with its clean, elegant, simplistic approach in serving outstanding brunch offerings!  Menu is a nice mix of traditional brunch offerings with a few creative twists to others (brunch salad was something i noticed)Responsible priced, great location with lots of established neighborhood surroundings. Trendy without overcrowding and a beautiful covered private back patio. This is a great place to add to anyones favorite brunch destinations list."
"Gather is extraordinary: a gourmet quality restaurant priced very affordably, with a creative menu that introduces new taste combinations, without being so far out on the ledge that only the most sophisticated palates would attempt it. I LOVE Gather, and I have returned over and over again to enjoy dinner at one of the few restaurants in Chicago that is ready and willing to adapt dishes to my dietary restrictions without making me feel like a burden. Not only is everything they have served me -- from charred green beans to day boat scallops --  absolutely delicious, but it has been served with unusual graciousness. Go eat there soon and go back often. This is a restaurant that is truly a neighborhood resource that we should support."
"I'm so pleased this gem has found its way to Lincoln Square! The food was delicious and the service excellent. It also had great cocktails,  which is one of the things I truly look for in a restaurant. The best thing I've had there was the sweet potato soup they had a few months ago. I don't care of it's seasonal;  I could eat it daily,  even in the scorching heat of summer."
"My friends and I tried Gather for brunch for the first time last week and it was great! We started out with the fresh Donut and Sticky Bun as a sweet treat to hold us over - wow! These were probably my favorite part of the meal. I had the Braised Pork Shoulder Skillet which was really tasty and a huge portion. My friends tried the Benedict and the Cured Salmon (awesome presentation). Everything was great except for the fact that a cup of black coffee cost $4, but we will definitely be back to try dinner!"
"This is the perfect restaurant.  The perfect restaurant serves inventive, locally sourced, great tasting food.  We've been lucky to see Ken doing a demo at the Green City market -- and have had a couple of great conversations with him at the bar over the past year.  His philosophy of relaxed and accessible but also precise, delicate and exquisitely presented dishes shouldn't be so unique -- but it is.  Never had a disappointment on this menu. I'm a vegetarian -- and they have more than accommodated alterations or substitutions -- often recommended them themselves.  But we've brought every type of eater here -- and they have all left stunned.The perfect restaurant is truly welcoming -- both in its atmosphere, its menu, and its pricing -- without sacrificing any quality.  What is Gather?  Is it fine dining?  Yes, most definitely -- not just the food but the decor and service.  Is it family-friendly?  Yes -- check out the small-plate philosophy and their Sunday family dinner menu.  Is it affordable?  Yes -- and it's not just because of the small plates -- which are a fun way to construct your own meal -- but their entrees are, as I mentioned, impeccable -- but all the entrees are under $25 -- and most are under $20 -- and several around $15.  For the level of food, presentation, and service, this seems insane. Is it a great place to just grab a late night drink?  The small bar and the great back patio are homes away from home.The perfect restaurant has service that is elegant and attentive without being stuffy.  It's funny -- I often scoff at reviews that value service over the food. To me, good food can make me very tolerant of  inconsistent or even arrogant service. I'll just laugh it off.  But when a restaurant like Gather puts it all together -- their service seems inseparable from the culinary constructions coming out of the kitchen.  David, the manager, after only a few visits, has treated us like old friends.  And the servers -- especially Jamie -- have made us very comfortable without losing any professionalism or enthusiasm.Finally, the perfect restaurant is my neighborhood restaurant.  I know Gather is and should be a destination restaurant -- but it also fits incredibly well into the Lincoln Square vibe -- sophisticated but folksy and friendly.  I'm not exaggerating in saying that when I am asked why I live where I live, Gather itself would come up pretty close to the top of that list."
"I don't mean to cry over spoiled milk, but come on!We went for Sunday brunch and the cream served with my intelligentsia coffee was spoiled.  Not just turned a lil bit, but came out chunky and smelled like baby puke. First impressions are everything and they just crapped the bed.  After a somewhat half hearted apology and no adjustment on the bill, I have to go with three stars. The corn cakes were a 5 tho."
"I have to give this place 3 stars because of the 1-star dessert they served up. The rest of the food was excellent. The charcuterie plate was delicious, and it served 4 people as an appetizer. The short ribs were also very good, though perhaps slightly too sweet. Service was good as well. We weren't seated promptly even though we had a reservation for 4, and the place is too noisy to have a conversation, almost like a noisy bar instead of a restaurant. But the main disappointment was the rhubarb Napoleon. The rhubarb was tasteless and the pastry was undercooked. It was atrocious. I'd come here again for drinks and dinner, but go elsewhere for dessert."
"Such a great place! I was so happy with every single dish that was brought out - so much flavor in each one! The service was phenomenal and if you don't know what you want, their recommendations are always on point!"
"Had a great brunch here - service, food, overall ambience, and vibe all excellent.  Not loud either.  Hope to return soon."
"This place is awesome! And you can make reservations! It's super cute (a little loud) and fun. Server was super super nice - as I had laryngitis when I went- so he kept it to yes/no and letting me point ( also got a check yes or no note for another drink). And the food! We ordered brussel sprouts and the ricotta to share- and after tasting the sprouts, we ordered a second helping! The menu is all in season and made in house. Delicious entrees also came through- chicken, scallops, pasta, and duck- yum! But be warned the cauliflower is spicy! The aioli helps, and it is a flavorful heat, but this is not your momma's cauliflower. For dessert we ordered the apple fritters with extra caramel- so good! Drinks were also good - they have old school regulars made vey well!"
Called to find out wait time for party of 5.  Told me maybe 20 to 30 minutes wait because they save half of the tables for walk in.  Got there 20 minutes later. Wait is 2 and half hours.  Asked them why did they tell me differently on the phone.  Answer was they were not sure who answered the phone.  Just great.
"We came here for the second time this evening. The first time the service was great, the food was well-timed, but the food was a little lacking. This time, I'm sorry to say, we were disappointed all around. Our first course (on a very slow Monday) took over 45 minutes. We had the pumpkin soup and the cured salmon. They were both good, however our waiter ignored us, I'm assuming because he was embarrassed,  however it would have been nice to hear an apology or explanation. When our entrees arrived, we were very disappointed.  The ravioli was under cooked, and the risotto was over salted, and buttery enough to ruin our appetite. We ended up canceling our second drink order in order to pay, leave,  and grab our night caps and dessert elsewhere. We won't be coming back."
"Things only went downhill after our very chilly/abrupt reception from the guy working the front. My date and I were 20 minutes early for an 8:45 reservation, and you'd have thought we were LATE from his annoyed tone and suggestion we sit at the bar to wait. After reaching the bar, we proceeded to stand -- without even so much as a glance, eye contact or greeting, by both the bartender, and the reception guy who was now working the bar helping the bartender fill drink orders for current tables. After 10 minutes of being ignored, I finally asked if we could order drinks and the bartender replied ""in a minute, I'm backed up."" I replied that it was obvious that he was backed up as I'd stood there from 10 minutes trying to get his attention to no avail. We were seated at our reservation time, and sat another 10 minutes before even a greeting form the waiter. We ordered another round of drinks and they took another 10 minutes to arrive. We finally ordered the Brussel Sprouts, Octopus, Chicken and the Ricotta spread. The ricotta was the highlight; the rest not so much. The sprouts were over salted, but edible. The octopus was the opposite - totally inedible - it was so burned you couldn't chew it, let alone handle the charred taste. That went back. The chicken was OK, but again, suffered from the chef's heavy-handed salting. Service all along was really scattered and far too infrequent. Was a massive disappointment."
"Amazing restaurant, top notch service, great drinks. I really believe this is a gem in all the fine restaurant choices in Chicago. I have been there three times and the food is of exceptional quality, as is the service. The staff are very accommodating toward dietary needs (I am a vegetarian) and I can't say enough about all the other wonderful delights it has to offer. I can't wait to go back! Restaurants make Michelin bib for a reason. Gather!"
"One of the best meals I have had in a long time. The service was outstanding. Each dish is carefully prepared. The raviolo and fried chicken were my favorite.  I sampled a few items on the menu, and I was pleased with all of them. The cured salmon was quite good as well. I had the whiskey smash from the bar. I will be back at Gather a lot in the future."
"Tonight was my first experience at Gather, I have a food smirk on my face:) every single bite was delicious!! A friend and I shared the Mussels, Risotto, Brussel sprouts and Ravioli. We also tried the Banana Cake for dessert...so great! The Brussel sprouts has to be my #1,you cannot go without ordering these! But then again I loved everything! The banana cake: bacon, black pepper, chocolate, butter... So good!!"
"Gather is a solid establishment. I have been here twice now. The first time I came here was for brunch last summer with my bff. We dined out on the back patio and sipped mimosas - Yum! For our starter we shared the sticky buns which are AMAZING. I had ordered the Uovo Raviolo as my main and ended up being super jealous of the bff's Chicken Fried Biscuit. The biscuit (what I could steal away from her..jk she was super nice and offered me a bite) is something I would seriously consider ordering next time. As for my lone raviolo, I think that says it all: it is a lonely little ravioli not meant to be consumed as one's sole brunch item. As an app, fine, but it doesn't fit in the gluttonous-put-me-in-a-food-coma-of-deliciousness brunch category.The second time I visited was last Thursday for dinner with a buddy.  We waltzed in around 7:30 p.m. sans reservation and were promptly seated at one of the two communal tables in the front section of the restaurant. The ambience is pleasant and would make for a nice date (must take the boyfriend here next time!). The cocktails were very good. I had two Counts a vodka-based drink, whereas they buddy guzzled down two others, one of which was a whiskey smash which he enjoyed. We then shared the pork belly as our starter. Again, Gather knocks it out of the park when it comes to starts. The pork belly was the perfect balance of meaty and fatty and the portion size was just right. I ordered the apple endive salad as my main and was in love. The only criticism would be that there was very little of the walnut brittle that was promised. However, the little brittle that was there provided the necessary textural contrast that made the salad sing. The buddy asked the Chef if he could make an entree portion of a chicken tagliatelle that was on the four course Chef's week menu and the Chef.  We thought the odds of the Chef making it were slim, but thought it wouldn't hurt to ask. The Chef was great to accommodate our request and the buddy thoroughly enjoyed the dish. Overall, a solid bet for brunch or dinner. Can't wait to stop in for their Sunday Supper sometime!"
"I am a sucker for good service and this place did not disappoint. We started off our brunch with a doughnut (yum) and then ordered our respective dishes. Corn Griddle Cakes: YES YES YES... really, there is everything to love about this dish. The delicious pork with fantastic mouth feel and flavor, a balance of fat and meat paired with the polenta that really grounds the flavor.Benedict: This was a very, very solid benedict dish. Definitely one of the better ones I've had but I must admit, it was overshadowed by the awesomeness of the Corn Griddle Cakes.Can't wait to come back for dinner."
"Oh my oh my oh my.  My honey and I came to Gather to celebrate being together for two years. It was the right decision.  I wouldn't call the atmosphere ""romantic"".  It isn't. It's communal and open and cool and whoa does it smell good in there!  We had the amazing Brussels sprouts, the apple salad, 1/2 chicken, and cod. He tried the Autumn Serenade,and I had the delightfully refreshing ""The Count.""  One of the tastiest mixed drinks I've ever had. The chicken dish was especially cool since the chicken is prepared 2 different ways (on 1 plate).  We had such a lovely spectrum of taste and flavor.  The portions were perfect.  Incredibly filling, but not too much.The staff was very courteous, although...they all kind of look alike. I couldn't keep them straight.  No matter, because everyone gave us superb service.This was actually my third time at Gather.  I've had their brunch twice before, and based on those experiences, was SO looking forward to dinner.  I'll most certainly be back!"
"I came here for New Years Eve dinner with a group of 7 and we had a lovely experience. The eight course tasting menu was fantastic (served family style)!  My favorites of the meal were the simple salad with buttermilk dressing to start, pork belly with crispy Brussels sprouts, and scallops. Everything had amazing flavor and was cooked perfectly. Our group had a variety of cocktails including Manhattans, martinis, sazaracs and the whiskey smash. All were spot on. I can't wait to come back for more! Only complaints were the timing of the courses could have been a little better and we did have to wait past our reservation time to sit. I feel like we started out a bit slow and then got quite a few of our courses rushed together at the end."
"Really good spot.. First off, they have a bar that faces the kitchen with like 6 barstools!  Really liked watching the chefs at work.. also have another regular bar.  Great Wine List/ So so Beer List.. Prices about average here.  Very busy spot but the host did a great job getting all the parties seated.  Although I only had a burger, this easily ranks as one the tops in Chi-Town!  Can't wait to go back and try some more items off the menu..gdd"
"Great food!! I drove 30 miles to try the place. I wasn't disappointed. We ate 1/2 the menu!! Appetizers and main courses. I found the place by watching ""Check Please"" they all loved the food and I thought I would try it. They also have brunch which I'm going to try today. I'm really looking forward to returning there and trying something new. Try it you'll like it!!"
"I almost don't want to write this review. Selfishly, I don't want anyone to know about the hidden gem that is Gather, but I don't want to deprive them the recognition they deserve. So alas, here I am.How many good things can I mention, let me count the ways.Lincoln Square is my favorite neighborhood of Chicago thus far. Surrounded by parks and quaint little shops (and the occasional smell of German food), it was hard for me to go into this restaurant without already loving it just because of location.A new acquaintance told me of this place but said it can get very crowded. So I made last minute reservations online in hopes we could grab a table. On the site it asked the reason for coming, which I simply stated ""celebrating a job offer."" We were seated immediately and chose the back patio which was modern but still cozy. The weather was perfect. Not even a minute later our waitress brought two glasses of champagne in congratulations for my celebration. What a completely unexpected delight! I'm not a huge fan of bubbly so passed this onto my friend and ordered a Pimm's cup cocktail with fresh cucumber, strawberries, and orange juice. Yum! We started with the roasted green beans in sofrito aioli. Fresh and crisp with a wonderful flavor. I ordered the chicken two ways. Seared chicken breast and fried chicken thigh over a bed of roasted corn, fresh slaw, and tomato barbeque sauce. Beautifully presented, the portions were perfect (because fried chicken calories are deadly). My friend had the scallops which she said were some of the best she's had. I'm not a fan of these (it's a texture thing) and while I still didn't enjoy them because of that reason, the flavor was wonderful. The fried green tomatoes paired with her dish were amazing! We finished with the made to order peach cobbler. They warned us it would take about 10 minutes to prepare, which was close to nothing. The grilled peaches were perfect. The brown sugar streusel was overwhelmingly addicting. Paired with a delicious limoncello, I'm still craving this a day later.Upon all of the amazing food was the experience in general. Our waitress was fantastic even though the back patio had completely filled half way into our dining experience. She gave great recommendations and was attentive. Even after paying and walking out we had numerous employees thank us. This is my new favorite location in Chicago. But I'm going to hide that secret from many because I want a cute table with little to no wait.Bonus points to seeing a random kitten bouncing along the rooftop and watching the diners enjoy their food. It looked like he was a regular too."
"Great food, great selection of wine, fantastic atmosphere - will definitely come back!  Also looked like a pretty fantastic patio, but it was a tad too cool the evening we dined here.Had the chitarra - tasted great."
"A group of girls and I went in for Sunday Brunch. The food was delicious. However, when looking at my bank statement they added 15% gratuity onto my bill. That would have been fair by me - except that I had already left over 15% in cash for tip. Just makes me nervous that the waitress took it upon herself to add the tip for her service. Hope she enjoyed the $15 tip on the $36 tab."
"Great food, ambiance and service. The Ravioli appetizer is a must get. A gem in Lincoln Square."
"What a wonderful little spot this is. The food is American comfort and done so simply and beautifully. The bar serves up great craft cocktails done with skill without the hipster vibe and suspenders and post prohibition mustaches. Service was wonderful and everyone knows their stuff. HINT: if you can manage to score a seat in front of the open kitchen, you're in for a real treat. The chefs are friendly and will interact with you. The sous chef even tossed us a few free tester bites of smoked salmon with dill on creme fresh toasts as well as a chicken liver pate spread. We had the Brussel sprouts, the ricotta, and the steak tartare. All shareable and all wonderful. The key word is ""shareable"" here. These days the small plates concept only goes so far. Too many times that means decently priced with incredibly small portions or overly priced with 2 person portions. Not here. Gather knows how to do it. I would highly recommend this spot for dinner, drinks, or just bites. Warm atmosphere completed the entire experience."
"Gather is a Lincoln Square gem! From the low-set lighting, to the open floor plan, and the sleek decor all throughout, this place was impressively appetizing. For a table of two, we started with the ""Gather and share"" menu: the mussels with white beans (good, but not outstanding), sweet potato soup (incredible!), and cauliflower (spicy, with a sesame seed twist). These were paired with a smooth Malbec.We proceeded with the individual sized meals: pulled pork (excellent), spinach gnocchi (good, but my fantastic), scallops (amazing), and the seared chicken (very good). Lastly, we selected the rum cake drizzled with dark chocolate and served over home-made vanilla ice-cream. This was paired with their French press coffee, which was average. The menu was as great as the atmosphere! Our server was very cordial, and informative. We were always promptly provided with whatever we needed, by our server or the numerous wait-staff sauntering around wih an open eye. The entire dining experience was memorable. The quality/variety on the menu is in junction with the pricing- very fair.Two people ate satisfyingly well that evening, and will certainly venture back!"
"Lincoln Squarers were happy with this new addition to Lincoln Avenue last year and I was excited to try it. First impression?  A great place to go on a dinner and take friends, guests, and family but needs to focus more attention on the food taste, portions, and value.  A restaurant cannot survive by atmosphere alone (well, perhaps the Signature Room on 95th on top of the Hancock can). HERE IS WHAT OUR PARTY OF 4 LIKED:Atmosphere (just so dang welcoming from the front window all the way to the back patio)Decor (great lighting and appointments)Back patio dining (heated during cold!)Open kitchenVarious seating options (tables, high tops, back patio, etc.)HERE IS WHAT WE DIDN'T:Food portions - 2 of 4 apps that we ordered had to be cut into thimble-sized portionsFood taste - on the bland side, forgettable Memorability - No one in our party remembers much about what we ate other than the microscopic size of thingsValue - not a very good value when you evaluate costs to portion to qualityRegarding portions... just to be clear: we are NOT fans of huge portions in the style of Maggiano's or Cheesecake Factory.  The contrary is true. But there is a significant difference between cartoon-like portions and bistro-style food portions (Gather's Website claims that you are walking into their home. Apparently, Stuart Little's). BUT WAIT!:I always give a local restaurant a second chance --- or 3rd, or 4th, or in the case of Bob Chinn's a 5th--- so I will and will update my review then.  (Okay maybe not ALL places. The Big Cheese was such a colossal disaster that I would rather eat a grilled cheese made from Velveeta, I Cant Believe It's Not Butter, and an iron)."
"Amazing. Everything was absolutely amazing. We didn't have a reservation on a Friday night but in my opinion we got the best seats in the house at the bar in the kitchen pass thru. So cool to watch those guys work. DO not miss the Brussels sprouts. Literally the best ive ever had and the mushroom risotto was equally as awesome. Husband had the ""best burger ever"" and I had axing diver scallops. Going back next weekend!"
Was in town from New York.  Truly outstanding and inventive food.  Sit at the kitchen table and you can chat with the chefs as they prepare your meal.  The Brussels sprouts are not to be missed.  Wish I had this place to frequent in NYC.
"Gather left much to be desired. When we walked in around 7 they were not busy. It took forever for our waitress to come over and tell us the specials and take our drink orders. We ordered a total of four drinks for the entire meal, mainly because our waitress was so sparse throughout the 2 hour ordeal! On top of it they got half of them incorrect. Mine was wrong the first round and my date's was wrong the second. It was annoying. From there, service just got worse. And our entrees took almost 50 min to show up. I got the ramps to start and the fresh made pappardelle for dinner. Both were boring and not near enough food to fill me up. I was very disappointed in the pasta because there were almost NO veggies or cheese. And the sauce = butter and salt. Come on man!My date ordered the whipped ricotta and the scallops. The ricotta was more like a dessert because the balsamic reduction was overly sweet, not at all acidic. Had the acid been there it could have been a great counter balance to the honey. Great idea, very poor execution. His scallops were boring and there were only a couple with almost nothing else on the plate. It was quite ridiculous. For a 120 dollar meal... neither of us were happy. Don't bother."
"Made a reservation for my birthday on Sunday night and sat on the patio in the back. It was a perfect date night and the food was amazing. We ordered the Cauliflower, Cured Salmon, Sirloin, Tagliatelle Pasta and Pumpkin Cheesecake. Everything we tasted was absolutely delicious and the service was superb. My husband and I can't wait to come back!"
"Daniel C and I went for brunch one happy Sunday late morning. There were no guests inside - only outside on the back patio. We chose to eat inside at the kitchen bar where we had a first class view of the two chefs.We got three different drinks, two appetizers, two entrees, and two sides:Bloody Mary - good flavor but chunky.Bellini - super duper good!Brunch Bomb - also yummy.Donuts - crispy on the exterior, soft interior, and gooey sauce on top.Sticky Bun Bites - fabulous flavor and soft texture.Chicken Fried Biscuit - absolutely divine. I'd totally get this again.Benedict - Daniel C's food. Read his review for his opinion.Bacon - really delicious.Breakfast Sausage - Fantastic flavor! Also, who can complain when they threw it in for free just because they heard me wondering about it?I really adored coming here for brunch. I loved that it was quiet and nice, that we could watch the chefs, and that we had top notch food. Oh! And it was for a good price. We each paid about $36 (including tip)."
"We live in Lincoln Square, and I am thrilled this place exists.  First off, this place is L-E-G-I-T.  I preface this review by stating we love getting out in Chicago to try new food.  Been to El Ideas, Les Nomades, Tru, Sepia, Girl/Goat, blah blah---this place honestly was one of the best, if not the best, places I have been to in Chicago in 10+ years.  We went there last night--had a nice bottle of burgundy (very nicely priced) and did all shared plates.  We had the Ricotta, Steak Tartar, Ravioli, Duck Confit, and brussel sprouts, with the strawberry/rhubarb dessert.  Ricotta - Crazy Good.  Honey/Balsamic paired great and the bread was perfect.Steak Tartar - Some of the best I've had, enough said---sweet and perfect.Ravioli - Again, crazy good--rich, but not too much.  Duck - Great small portion.  Crispy skin, can't beat that.Brussel Sprouts - very good, and awesome idea with the fish flake.  So easy to over-salt (ahem, Girl and the Goat), but this was perfect.Strawberry/Rhubarb - Very good.  A little hard to cut, but tasted awesome.  Crispy rhubarb is my favorite.  This delivered.Overall, I was thinking the last time that I ordered 5-6 dishes and all were 10/10.  Gather delivered and we will be going back.  Prices are beyond reasonable.  Ambiance is great (sit outside if you can, beautiful back area), service was genuine.  Overall----awesome.  I would, and will, go back."
"Went to brunch at Gather today (2nd weekend in a row!). The first time I was here, I was really surprised that it was pretty empty, when other brunch places in the area (Fork, Cafe Selmarie) were totally packed. I assumed it was just lucky for us, and we sat on the beautiful, covered patio. Today, the place was even emptier, and I don't quite understand why.The food here is very good. Both times I've been here, we've started with the sticky bun, which is a cinnamon roll with a few candied walnuts on top. I would prefer it if it were a true sticky bun, with no icing and more nuts, but this is a good cinnamon roll.The chicken fried biscuit is delicious, and so much food! Large, house made biscuit, with de-boned, skin-on dark meat, breaded and fried to be fabulously crispy, covered in bechamel sauce. The first time I was here, my friend had the raviolo, which she said was good, but we both found the portion to be a bit skimpy, considering it didn't come with a side.Today, the bf had eggs benedict, which he really liked. The english muffin was crispy and well toasted, and the eggs were poached well. He mentioned the canadian bacon was not quite was he was used to, but he it was still good.The breakfast potatoes are amazing. They're as crispy as the other reviews make them out to be, and well salted. Whatever you order, make sure you get these!Side of bacon was extremely large, and the flavor was very smokey. Unfortunately, it was flaccid and pretty greasy- I'd skip this.The not-so-good:Water comes in an empty wine bottle, which looks nice, but doesn't allow enough room for ice. This means that the water is pretty tepid- not exactly refreshing on a hot July day. I'd also prefer a larger cup for water (again, so it stays cooler).The coffee is Intelligensia (good!), but they only have french roast (super bad). They don't have an espresso machine, so if you're looking for caffeine, you're stuck with the french roast. Cream is left on the table, meaning that it's kind of warm, and you have no idea how long it's been sitting out."
"There are eleventy billion reviews for this place, so my dumb one won't matter.  But this food here is like afterglow after a fun romp.  If want to do it right, it's not cheap, but boy, it's good."
"If you go here on a night where it's nice, definitely ask to be seated outside. Their back patio is beautiful! It's private, and the ambiance is just so inviting. Had Andrew as our server and he was fantastic! Very attentive and had great suggestions. We came in a bit late and he didn't seem annoyed or pushy at all (thank you!). And the food was absolutely divine. As you've probably read, steak tartar and Brussels sprouts are an absolute must! My friend and I both had halibut and it was also delicious. Will definitely be going back to try the rest of the menu!!"
"One of the better overall meals I have had dining out in the last several months.  Whipped ricotta and brussel sprout sharing dishes were unique, flavorful and portioned to share amongst the 3 of us.  Signature cocktails were liked by all and, importantly, not too sweet which is often the downfall of these trendy drinks at many places.  Mains were mostly great; chicken and especially the halibut.  The only reservation was the short rib which was more ordinary and less creative than the other dishes.  Did not have dessert though the panna cotta sounded like it would be worth trying.  Service was ok, long waits for drinks and between courses as well as for wine and to get our lantern re-lit which we needed as the outdoor patio is covered and the lighting is there for mood rather than for reading menus and seeing your dining companions."
"Gather is amazing. Get the crunchy Brussel sprouts. Just do it!But seriously, they are executing their mission beautifully. They know who they are. They make delicious food. They have great staff, a great atmosphere, and creative cocktails. Plus that little extra something that most restaurants don't have...maybe it's their personality, confidence, and enthusiasm.Will definitely be back!"
"This place is an absolute gem. From the moment we walked in and were greeted by the lovely host who took our coats to the moment we left it was a great experience. The setting is cozy with exposed wood and turquoise walls, a great escape from this years winter. The food was delicious and the staff was very accommodating to my boyfriend's gluten allergy. We were quite hungry to started with the spicy cauliflower side dish- it was fantastic, I wanted to drink the sauce it was in. We also had the whipped ricotta- it was really nice, a sweet appetizer with honey and balsamic, and the best part it comes with a toasted baguette, but they brought out cut up fruit and veggies to make it gluten free. The steak tartare was incredible and they brought root chips for my boyfriend along with the bread it comes with. For my entree I had the scallops and they were the best scallops I have ever eaten. They came on a bed of beets and spatzle and looked very avant grade- beautiful presentation with a delicious brown sugar crumble- they were melt in your mouth good. My boyfriend ordered the short ribs and said he really enjoyed them as well.We will definitely be returning!"
Took my fiance here for her birthday. Our group had a great time. Service was exceptional. Everything we ate and drank was top notch. Will defiantly hit this one again
"Came here for brunch with the wifey and at first I was underwhelmed by the brunch menu. Thought the dishes were pretty typical until we got seated at the kitchen counter where we got to watch the chefs work their magic. Maybe I was just really hungry, but everything they were putting together looked fantastic.I usually order the eggs benedict no matter where I go (always a great test), but I opted for their Corn Griddle Cakes to try something different. The corn cakes came with braised pork belly, creamy polenta with melted cheddar cheese, a few pieces of jalapeno and topped off with a fried egg. I absolutely loved the dish. Pork belly was succulent, polenta was creamy but not too filling. When mixed with the egg and jalapeno, it had just the right amount of kick. I must've looked like I was enjoying myself a great deal since the lady next to us had to ask what I was gnoshing on mid-chew. When she took her first bite of her order, I could almost feel her aura of approval. The only slightly disappointing thing I can point out is that the bloody mary had too much horse radish. I normally like mine spicy, but it was a little overwhelming and not my favorite. Not bad by any means, just not my top choice. This is a solid 4 out of 5 for me and I plan on coming back to see what else this place has to offer. It gets packed pretty quickly so be sure to make reservations."
"Amazing food all around! Incredible meal, everything tasted very fresh and flavorful. Well paced and wonderful attention to detail. A MUST!!!"
"Yum! Came here last night with two friends for my birthday dinner and had a lovely time. We started with a few drinks, I had the overnight sensation which was a bit tart (in a good way) and super fresh. One of my friends had The Count (ah ah ah!), I tasted it and LOVED the fresh grapefruit. Definitely something I'd order. We started off our meal with a few plates to share. The whipped ricotta is phenomenal, the grilled octopus was cooked beautifully as well. Then we tried the Uovo Raviolo. I have an aversion to runny yolks, which I've been trying to get over, and I thought this was a great dish and brought me closer to accepting runny yolks. For dinner I had the halibut. GOOD GOD. I am still thinking about that halibut and it's been a good 18 hours since I've had it. The polenta was cooked perfectly, and had a smooth and velvety texture. Gather also has wine coolers, which you should totally get on. One of my friends had the citrus and I had the stone. Both were fabulous. For dessert, we split the chocolate cake, and as a bonus, the chef gave us an order of fritters with vanilla ice cream, which was a super sweet gesture and greatly appreciated. Our waitress mentioned it was because we were the first ones in the restaurant. Service was amazing, and we had a great time. My one (tiny) complaint is that the music just really does not match the atmosphere of the place at all. But nothing too crazy that I couldn't get over. I definitely want to try their burger next time, which I hear is super good."
"This review is 3.5 stars.We came here for dinner on Saturday with friends. The restaurant is very small and gets quite crowded so make sure to make a reservation. I found all of the drinks extremely tasty, especially the overnight sensation.For starters we had the steak tartare, the charcuterie board, and pea soup. The steak tartare was the tastiest steak tartare I have had in a very long time. it was so well seasoned! Delicious. The charcuterie board was so so, nothing amazing. Also it was supposed to come with honeycomb, but there was no actualy honeycomb on the board, just drizzled honey. The pea soup was a mixed bag because the shrimp sausage was great but the soup itself was a little too salty.For my entree, I had the scallops which were very tasty and had a nice sear, but they were definitely a bit too salty. I wish there had been a bit more oxtail too. I tried my friend's striped bass and it was very good, with crispy skin. The beet salad was delicious-the mascarpone was great in there. The brussel sprouts were fine but nothing too special. For dessert, we shared the frozen chocolate cake. I love it when I got a bit of the cake with the homemade peanut butter, great combo of sweet and salty. Anyways, if you come here eat the steak tartare and beet salad and try all the drinks!"
We had a decent meal there bit as I try to write this review a couple months later I can't say I remember a single meal we had. I do recall being shuffled around to a couple if tables before we got settled because if their odd reservation policy. They take done reservations but leave most tables for walk ins.
"At first we were behaving a little immaturely, and refusing to enter the former location of our favorite restaurant (LM) but Friday we grew up a little and decided to give Gather a try. So glad we did. Gather kicks it up a notch BIG TIME, from the cocktails to the all the dishes, each item was perfectly created. started with the seasonally available ramps, which included pickled, pureed and sautéed versions on a wood board served with focaccia and house made stone ground mustard. this was just the beginning. I had the Halibut, Mellody the scallops and then we had to have green onion gnocchi for dessert. Gather has communal tables and two and four tops. We opted to sit at the kitchen counter where we were able to watch all the dishes prepared in a remarkably small space. the chefs were all happy to share their work and tell us tips and stories....until the pace got so hectic they were moving at warp speed and we didn't want to bother them. We really enjoyed the kitchen bar, I recommend it if that's your thing.seems like we've found our new friday evening spot, sorry Fork, but Gather is really good and about the same price once all's said and done."
"We have eaten here 3 times. Love the food and the fact that the menu changes often and is based on seasonal, farm to table ingredients. The chef is very accommodating and the wait staff and bartenders are friendly and very good at what they do. Very pleasant experience. Going back in 2 weeks!"
My husband and I enjoyed a belated Valentine's dinner at Gather tonight.  We had the pork belly and octopus as appetizers and the chicken and short ribs for our entrees.  Everything was delicious!  We especially liked the pork belly and the short ribs were melt in your mouth fabulous.  The service was superb and the atmosphere was lovely.  We'll be back to try their brunch!
"Very good food. They cater well to dietary restrictions. Can get extremely busy and service can be slow. Also, they have a few servers who aren't the friendliest. However, since fresh, well-prepared, safe food is really what I look for (a place with a rock solid kitchen) this place is high on my list. We now have special occasion meals here - and I still get excited about it whenever we go.  Also, extra special kudos for this... I made a reservation on Christmas Eve and then realized they were serving a prix fixe menu. I called and asked if they could accommodate us (TWO gluten and dairy free diners). The host was lovely. He even called me back to assure me that chef would prepare something special for us - including dessert. So the dessert was some fresh fruit and honeycomb. At least it wasn't sorbet. The honeycomb was an interesting twist."
"Gather is quite good - cocktails and wine were great and food was delicious. We had a great, reasonably priced bottle of tempranillo ($36) and a variety of cocktails (about $10 each). We shared food and portions were healthy for ""small plates."" Loved the whipped ricotta, bread, cheese plate, and pork belly. Warning: very salty cuisine, but that doesn't really bother me.The place is beautiful (although they've put a bit too much seating in this space in my opinion - a bit crowded). Our waiter was excellent, as was the bartender. The host left something to be desired...which leads me to my one complaint: we had a reservation at 9:45 PM for dinner...and were not seated until 10:15-20 PM. This was annoying because, well, we made a reservation, but also because there is nowhere to stand in the space because of how it's designed. We stood at the only bar area without seated people (who were eating) - the waiter bus station. So, basically we were in a walking path for over half an hour - NOT COOL. But...we loved everything else, so we'll be back. I just hope they plan reservations better in the future (BTW, one of the people i was with said that last time he went there he had the same problem with the reservation time)."
"Wine was great and prices aren't outrageous. We ordered a bottle between three of us and an extra glass after.Atmosphere was very dark and cool, but not exclusive, very warm and welcoming. In a busy Saturday, it wasn't too loud or crowded.Food is very rich and filling, which is why your portions are small. Service was quick and personable. Generally a higher class joint than the doves I enjoy frequenting, so I'd only go back for a special occasion."
"I was so excited when I heard that Gather had opened, calling them on their first day of service and making reservations for Friday. (BTW, you'll want to do this - they were busy). Friday rolls along and it is an exceedingly difficult day. J is worried at about how sad and out-of-whimsy I am, and we so head off to Gather, because we still need to eat, and it is rude to cancel reservations last minute. The host greeted us with such a warm welcome, that I managed to put everything on pause for 90 minutes, sit and really enjoy my company, surroundings and the accompanying food and drink. I started with the Overnight Sensation (Tito's vodka, Fresh lime, Fresh Blackberries and Raspberries) and loved it. We moved on to sharing a bunch of food: the house-made ricotta with honeycomb and balsamic (ORDER. THIS.), the raviolo, the short rib Irish stout chili, the hamachi crudo, and the porchetta sandwich. I really enjoyed my meal. I could come in and eat the crudo every day. No major complaints, other than the raviolo dish was a smidge salty, but nothing that stopped me from eating it all. Service was warm and welcoming. I'm always happy to see when restaurant staff are excited that you are dining with them. The counter seats that looks into the open kitchen are really neat. I will definitely be back. I read something about Sunday night dinners? I love Sunday night dinners! (Well, every night dinners, but still..)We needed this in the area, but don't be shy, come up to Lincoln Square and try it out. Welcome to the neighborhood, Gather!"
"We enjoyed Gather on our first visit, so we stopped in again on a Sunday evening. They've added something new for Sundays: a family dinner menu. The menu is made up of relatively kid-friendly share plates (that also are likely to appeal to adults) and sides; you pick 3 sharing items (e.g., salad, pulled pork, squash risotto, ...) and the table gets those plus a selection of sides, all for $26/adult (kids under 10 eat free, one per adult).This is a genius idea for the Lincoln Square neighborhood, where there are well-heeled families who'd like to go out for a special family dinner in a nice place with good food. It exposes the kids to something tonier than McDonald's or Olive Garden (no disrespect intended), and allows the adults to teach the kids about food and to model good dining behavior. On the evening we visited, there were mostly tables with toddlers and primary-age kids, all reasonably well-behaved.While this is terrific for families, however, it may not be the vibe for adults who want more of a ""grownup"" or ""date night"" ambiance. We enjoyed our meal, and I'm not inclined to change my * rating -- but I'll probably limit future visits to the other nights of the week. My companion summed it up at the end of the meal: ""[I really like this place, but] on Sunday, not so much."""
"Brunched here with friends this morning- I love that they take reservations. The Sunday brunch wait is something I just can't deal with. And this place had plenty of open seats. I think people just don't know it's there. The signage isn't great, which sucks because it was delicious. More people need to know about Gather.Went with industry friends so we had a nice variety of the menu. The sticky bun is absolutely to die for. Seriously wonderful with excellent flavor. The doughnut was really lovely, and I'm not a big doughnut fan (yes, I know, I'm unAmerican). It was light and fluffy with the perfect amount of glaze. Yum. The raviolo was also great, and the flavors in it are very unique. For my main I had the brioche bread bowl with mushrooms, asparagus, sausage, poached egg and home fries. The home fries are amazing. They could have just given me a plate of those. In fact, I wish they had. They're more like smashed crispy potatoes than fries, but the salt level is so perfect. Oh man I want more home fries. They do all their bread and everything in house too, so I was excited for the brioche. It wasn't as rich as I thought it was going to be, but it was really good. The only thing I would've liked was a little more spice or salt or something on the egg and inside the bowl. I cleaned my plate. Friends got the ramen and the fried chicken, which they both finished off & said were delicious and ""bomb ass"" respectively. If you haven't been to Gather, you're missing out. The atmosphere is so calm and comfortable and relaxing, and the food is great. I'll be going back for dinner for sure."
"Came here with the girlfriend and my mom, had one of the best meals I've had in a while... the scallops were a stand out, as was the cheese and charcuterie plate...  the short rib was a bit dry , but nothing substantial. .. the gnocchi was some of the best I've had. . Beautiful patio,  I honestly did not want to leave"
"I stumbled upon this little gem in the neighborhood on Christmas Eve. Initially, I had intended to go to Tiny Lounge, have some craft cocktails and start One Hundred Years of Solitude.  And I was excited to do this on Christmas eve, because really, isn't reading a magical piece of fiction with a drink in solitude that best way to spend an evening? Only, after walking in the bitter cold, I realized that Tiny Lounge was actually closed... so, what do I do, know that I didn't want to go to a dive bar, I pull up Yelp mobile app and search for cocktails.  Gather was first one listed and since I never heard of it, I hurriedly walked to get warmth.  When I entered, I was shocked how nice it was and how friendly the greeter (Maître d'?) and had a short conversation.  I sat at the bar, and to give you some info, there are stools to sit at the bar or at the kitchen window (so you can see your food cooked).  There are also traditional tables.  On the night I went there, Christmas eve, there was one couple at the tables and 3 people at the stools by the Kitchen.  No one at the bar, so that's where I headed.  I ended up talking with the bartender, Patrick, who was friendly enough (and bonus points on having no vest or attitude) and made me some good Old-Fashioneds... nothing superfluous but well proportioned.  I didn't order dinner so I won't comment on the food.   I did order the house made ricotta with balsamic glaze and honey, it didn't rock my boat as the ricotta from Davanti Enoteca (which, they give you the ricotta in a mason jar and honeycomb on the side for you to put together).  Gather's version - the honey got lost in the cheese.Since this is walking distance, I'll have to come and check this out again.  Maybe even try the food."
Good food and good service. Had a great time here. Everything was great. Went here for brunch and had a skillet. I also took some things to go. Definitely want to go back but need reservations. It gets really packed.
"This place, the menu, the cocktails, the staff & atmosphere is FANTASTIC. Possibly my new favorite restaurant"
"I made a last-minute reservation here for Valentine's Day, and we were not disappointed in the least! In traditional, cheesy holiday fashion, we ordered cava and several share plates. My favorites were the octopus and the roasted brussel sprouts. The octopus was so succulent and not chewy at all - I was astounded at how wonderful the texture was. If I didn't have a boyfriend, I would have asked the brussel sprouts to marry me. Holy moly. They were savory, nutty, and charred to perfection. Just incredible.Service was also fantastic! Our waitress was very charming, attentive, and knowledgeable (but not in a hoity-toity way). Looking forward to returning to try their brunch menu!"
"We arrived and waited several awkward minutes at the front door bunched together with other patrons wondering, 'Is there a host or hostess here?'  Several servers walked by without acknowledging us or anyone else standing there.  Eventually a host came and although there were several two tops that were empty and dirty since we came in, we were asked to wait at the bar until our reservation for two was ready.Although the décor of the restaurant is warm and inviting the layout is not.  The bar is also a dining area for 3 to 5 people.  It's directly across from the open kitchen, which also has a bar for diners.  The bottleneck leads to a very confined, uninviting area to wait for your table.  Or reservation was at 8, by 8.15ish we still hadn't been seated and since there is only one bartender for the entire restaurant and he has customers at his bar to serve I had not been able to order a drink while we were waiting.  After about 10+ minutes the bartender asked what I would like but without providing a menu of the wine or specialty cocktails they make.We finally sit down.  Albeit after an employee's brother and family member, who arrived 10 mins. after us, are seated first at one of the two tops that took the busboy 15 mins. to get to.  Sort of bad form, especially when you seat us right next to them so we can realize what just happened.The menu is small but diverse.  It's broken up into three sections of sharing plates, appetizers and entrees.  Our waitress was informed but a bit aloof.  She advised us that we should order all of our food at once and the kitchen would serve whatever was ready.  That was a bit off-putting and odd for a menu that seemed to be designed to course out items on it.  The Whipped Ricotta was great and my favorite thing we tasted that night.  It is a huge portion and could be easily shared between four people.  The Grilled Octopus was good but certainly not amazing.  The Cauliflower dish, which the kitchen forgot (No Big Deal but noted for what occurred later), was also unique and tasty.  All share plates and appetizers seemed to be within $8 to $15.For entrees we had the Halibut, which I liked but wasn't floored by, and the Spaghetti.  Spaghetti was tasty, rich but a bit on the smaller side.  They have some diverse wine selections and a variety of specialty cocktails, the cocktails seemed to lean towards the traditional.  My Manhattan was good though.So, we were there for my birthday dinner.  My ladyfriend called an hour before to remind them of such and that we would be ordering dessert and if they could please put a candle on it.  No request to sing or anything ridiculous like that but a candle would be nice.  They confirmed that would be no problem.Dessert comes no candle, we are half way done with it when the waitress says, 'I'm so sorry, I brought you the Apple Pie.  Not the Apple Fritter you ordered'.  I didn't think anything of it because the Apple Pie was suppose to have Cinnamon Ice Cream on it and while what we got certainly didn't look 'Fritter like' the ice cream tasted very vanilla-ie, which was what came with the Fritter.We said at this point we were pretty much full and that the Apple Pie was o.k. and it wasn't a huge deal.Bill comes, Apple Fritter is still on it.  Given the awkward wait to begin with, the family and friends being sat before a customer and forgetting one of our dishes we ordered I had to draw a line at that point.  (I didn't even realize there was suppose to be a candle on the dessert till after we left)  I asked our server if she could take off the Fritter since  we never actually got it.  Mind you this was less than 6% of our total bill, clearly not trying to get something for nothing but on principle it should have never been on the bill in the first place.  Waitress says, 'Let me check.'At this point same host/manager comes over and asks, 'How was everything?'.  No acknowledgement of the fact they messed up our dessert, no 'I'm sorry we made a mistake.  Of course will take it off the bill.  Would you like a Fritter as well or can we give it to you to go?'  All things you would do if you're trying to make sure your guest is happy and more importantly that they come back.  I replied, 'Everything was good.', it was but that doesn't mean I want to pay for an item I didn't receive.  Things got a bit tense, as would be expected when someone is trying to make you look like a jerk for their mistake.  Host/Manger ended up leaving the table without confirming whether he was removing dessert or making it for me to go, as I requested him to do if he was going to charge me for it.  Same manager ended up confronting my girlfriend while she was waiting to go to the bathroom to confirm, 'Everything was o.k.'.Just a very strange end to a pretty tasty experience.  Gather has the hard part right, the food is good.  It's the rest that needs work."
I went to gather after reading reviews on zagat and chicago eater. I got the burger and it was cooked perfectly.The host and the waitress were very attentive.They let me know it had only been open a few days.The menu had a lot of great options and I would like to go back to try more things.Sticky buns for dessert were great!
"I really enjoyed this place.  Walked in tonight and sat at chefs table thing and couldn't be happier.  The food was excellent.  Get that ravioli thing for sure.  Brussels were great and gnocchi was very good and extremely unique.  Drinks were great and i really enjoyed talking and watching the chefs work.  Fun, a little expensive for what you get but more than ok and hell they threw in a dessert that was home made nutella and cheescake.  Try this place no downside at all"
"My friend and I got a recommendation to go to Gather for brunch. We called the morning of hoping to squeeze in a reservation. No luck, but the hostess said to come in because we could eat at the bar. When we arrived we waited 5 minutes and was asked if we wanted to eat at the kitchen bar.  Both my friend and I agreed. It was the most quietest brunch I've ever had.  The entire time was watched as the chefs worked seamlessly in a small kitchen and drooling over each plate.  It was an amazing experience and the chefs were very friendly engaging in a few conversations.Let's get to the good stuff, the food was amazing! Between the two of us we ordered the chicken fried biscuits, skillet, and flapjacks (yes we're serious eaters).  Everything was delicious and it was even more enjoyable because we got to see it being made!  The fried chicken was perfectly cooked and bone free! The flapjacks melted in your mouth and the large helping of butter wasn't overpowering at all but a perfect compliment that syrup wasn't even necessary. The skillet looked small but was surprisingly filling. Over all the brunch was epic and now I want to go for Sunday dinner!"
"Food completely underwhelmed, especially for the money. Service was respectable. This was for a recent early week day dinner.  Too much focus on the ""gathering"" concept"" and not enough attention to the quality of the food. don't need to be so gimmicky...urban diners are use to sharing food. no need to be so literal. Vera is better.Meat / cheese plate: Good bread, board well-presented but no cured meats!!! A few small slices of regular ham and pieces of chicken sausage? Come on! Octopus: Way too salty. Can't even appreciate the seafood when it's soaked in salt. Pork Belly: was not cooked properly IMO. should have been crispy on the the outside to complement the gooey fatty inside. Instead the pork just tasted like a block of oil. Tomato Salad: best dish we had, but not worth $11 for less than 1 tomato.Chicken: The fried boneless leg is a nice touch but batter waaayyy to salty. Not sure why they pair it with seared chicken breasts (though the breast was well-cooked). people typically like dark or white meat. why have both and/or cook each differently? Slaw is ok. Sauce looks like BBQ sauce but tasted like salty tomato paste.Chocolate Cake: cake is nothing like the description. you get chocolate plain cake and then they decorate the plate with the other stuff. not very good either.apple cobbler: this is not a real cobbler!!! there is no real crust on the top. all you get is crumbles and not very much of it. this is really a crisp. top didn't taste very good so you really just get a bowl of cooked apples for $8. not worthwhile."
"Great food. Creative and yummy dishes to share. Couldn't drink bec. I'm preggers, but the cocktails looked fab. Had the muscles and the asparagus, both outstanding. Try to sit outside in the summer. Decent prices for quality food in a nice upscale atmosphere."
"Had a $75.00 gift certificate so I thought I would give it a try.  Made reservations for  Friday evening.  Upon entering, nice greeting, sat outside on a fabulous night with friends and family.  Only 4 vodka brands offered, I chose the only one I liked, Death's Door.  After appetizers I ordered another Death's Door, a bartender came out and said they ran out of Death's Door.  The other vodka's on hand were sub-par in my mind and are not what I call enjoyable, plus I get head aches from them.  I ordered a diet coke!  I asked the waitress if they could run across two blocks to get some more good vodka, she said they have done such a thing for produce and would ask.  Never another word, even after I told the waitress that my opinion of the restaurant dropped significantly.  Food arrived, pasta was somewhat bland.  Dessert was great.  Overall, not impressed as there are much better restaurants in the area.  Even with the $75.00 gift certificate, ended up spending an additional $170.00.  One cocktail for me, two for another and that's it.  I certainly don't mind spending money if it's worth it, but come on $2.50 for a small can of diet coke?  In total, we drank 5 cans = $12.50."
"Had a wonderful dinner here Saturday.  We walked in without a reservation and were seated at the stools in front of the open kitchen (always fun).The chef's were friendly, and gave us some samples.  Our cocktails were expertly mixed, and the brussels sprouts with bacon we shared as an appetizer was amazing.  I had the pasta with lemon butter and mushrooms...it was a little onion heavy, but super flavorful.  My friend had the chicken, which was great!  For dessert, we had the chocolate cake, but we also got an apple fritter after the chef overheard me saying it looked great.  The apple fritter wasn't greasy!Overall, great experience, especially for such a new place!  I will definitely return."
"This place is simply amazing. Ive eaten here 5 times now and am yet to be dissapointed, besides the grilled peaches (got to crtique something).First the staff: friendly, polite, engaging and knowledgable of the restaurant, the food and the story behind the food. Second, the food. Amazing. 1 star michelin quality at less than bib gourmand pricing. The half chicken is perfection. Fried and seared pieces on one olaye with gravy and goodness. The short rib is divine. The gathering board is possibly the best charcuterie in the city. Pretty much everything is near perfect or better. For the price, its hard to find better anywhere. Thankfully this is in lincoln square and not river north or lincoln park so you actually have a nice welcoming atmosphere without pretentiousness. Go here and thank me later. Also get a Pimms cup made by Scott, sorry Eric (manager) but Scotts the best"
"Randomly stumbled upon this restaurant on a Monday. As a Lincoln Square resident, I'm not sure how I've missed this place because everything - the food, the ambiance, the staff - it's all amazing. We shared several plates, each better than the last. The raviolo, homemade ricotta and the octopus were my favorites. The chocolate peanut butter ganache dessert was heaven on a plate. The staff was kind and thoughtful with their recommendations. Loved being right up at the counter interacting with the chefs. Go there, try everything. You will not be disappointed."
"Honestly, this was probably one of the greatest meals I've ever had. I had the skillet: black beans, avocado, pork belly, cheddar, French Fries and a fried egg on top. It was absolutely outstanding. My hats go off to the chef, if only I could cook like that. I would probably make this every single day. Also, this place is hip and beautifully decorated. Will be coming back soon!!"
"I'm reviewing here on 2 things, the most important things: Food and Service.  Food - You've done well, Gather!Service - Serious improvement needed.  I think it was just my server or at least I hope so.Let's start positive.The menu has small plates and entrees which is great for whatever mood you're in.  Highlights:  scallops (I would order again and again), ravioli (on special. delicate and full of flavor)  I actually liked everything we had including the whipped ricotta and charcuterie & cheese board.Vibe:  Warm lighting and colors.  Not too loud/not too quiet. Perfect for a 4-some or a date. Good for a night out with the ladies or with your man/woman.SERVICE:Damn, I really debating giving an overall 3 stars b/c my server acted like an adolescent with a chip on her shoulder.  She was so completely unengaged, unavailable and snooty.  1.  She was entirely rude about the wine and offering suggestions.  And it took her FOREVER to bring it to the table2.  She was never around. EVER.3.  Our charcuterie/cheese board was delivered but no one told us what the hell was on it until a manager saw us sitting there.  He came over and was nice as could be and started explaining the meats/cheese.  He was super informative until in the middle of his speel, he sees another server (not ours btw) and tells him that we need this explained to us.  That server says ok and then leaves b/c it's not his table. awesome. Our server finally comes over and rattles everything off in 5 sec. WHAT? Huh? Irritating!4.  It took another year to get a second bottle of wine which was served warm and it was Chardonnay. sick.I'm not saying do not go to this place, obviously b/c I'm still giving it 4 stars but be prepared to say something quickly if your server is distant and rude."
"Wow, just such disappointing customer service/administration.  I had a reservation, talked to the lady on the phone for a long while when making it, explained to her it was our first anniversary, wanted a spot at the kitchen counter, etc etc.  We get there and they have no record of our reservation!  Instead of being apologetic, the guy just lets us stand there in the middle of the restaurant clueless, doesn't explain what's going on, there's nowhere to wait, and I am just fuming pissed they pulled this crap on such a special occasion for us.  20 mins later we finally squeeze a spot at the bar to have drinks while we wait.  THEY DIDN'T EVEN BUY OUR DRINKS for the hour that we waited due to their screw-up.  At this point we're quietly just stewing inside.  There's only so many times you can voice your frustration/disapproval to the host and in return get more or less ignored.  Our ""lost"" reservation was for 8:30pm and we finally get our seat at the kitchen counter at 9:30pm.  Seriously, nothing was communicated to us about what they were going to do for us, nothing.Upon sitting down and trying to put on a polite face, we were eventually relaxed by the amazing chefs who prepared for us an appetizer of mussels on the house.  That was nice of the chefs, really, but to a larger customer service point: you screwed up a reservation on a super important (at least for us) occasion, we were ""obligated"" to buy some fairly expensive cocktails while we waited if we wanted to sit while waiting, and all you give us is a free $8 appetizer???  Hello, we spent well over that just waiting for our table at the bar.  They should've also comped our bar drinks at the MINIMUM, but I'm actually really surprised they didn't just pick up our bottle of wine off the final bill, because after all those things are marked up so much that it wouldn't even be a hard hit for them in the least.  So thanks for the crummy mood you put us in and the absolute WORST customer service I've ever experienced at a restaurant in the city.  And all you did for us was a free appetizer.  Get real.Aside from all that, the food is amazing and the chefs are SUPER awesome-- I highly recommend getting one of the 6 spots at the kitchen counter because it really is a treat to interact with the chefs and get their take on what's good that day.  Good luck dealing with the service of everyone else, though.  Just pathetically awful."
"If I could give Gather 6 stars I would. It is by far, one of the best experiences I have had dining in Chicago in the last few years. I took my fiance to Gather in December. I made the reservation online and simply said that the reservation was to celebrate his birthday. When we got there, the host took our coats and showed us to the 6-seat bar overlooking the kitchen. He said that since it was a special occasion he thought we'd love the seats - and we did. It was so fun seeing the chefs cooking and being able to chat with them. When we sat down he brought us complimentary glasses of champagne. The menu was phenomenal and since it was Sunday night we opted for the family-style dinner, which was an unbelievable price for a ridiculous amount of food. There was even an apple salad that sounded so amazing we added that on to the prix fixe menu. Little did we know that in addition to all the amazing food included in the prix fixe (appetizers, multiple sides, two entrees, dessert), the chefs sent us complimentary roasted brussels sprouts (possibly the best dish of the night - but hard to say because everything was amazing) AND an extra dessert with a candle. I don't know what was better - the food or the hospitality. We were so smitten that we thought about having the rehearsal dinner for our wedding there (sadly our rehearsal dinner guest list was too large). If that doesn't say it all, I don't know what does! We will definitely be back."
We've been back many times and any/all kinks with timing seem to have been resolved. This place is truly a gem!They've only elevated their game in recent months and it's become one of my absolute favorite places! My fiance and I are so grateful it's in our neighborhood!
"Can't say enough good things about Gather. Great food great service! Sit at chef's table if you can , best seats in the house.."
Was here for the Mother's Day brunch. Outstanding!! Very creative. Hands down the best omlette I have had. Secret is 87 whisks. I could drive from Naperville to the city for their omlettes. Their fresh baked bread selection is also good. Benedicts are awesome as well. I will be back for dinner.
"They were able to seat the two of us without a reservation, which is always nice. We started with the charcuterie board: it was good, but not particularly creative or delicious.  I had expected honeycomb, but alas it is just honey.  The meats and cheeses were good, but kind of ordinary and expected.I had the black angus and she had the striped bass.  My beef was one of the better cuts I've had, and the potatoes were crispy and well cooked; but I felt the dish could have used one more partner on the plate.  Perhaps some dressed greens or a fruit: it lacked an acidity I was so craving to complement the cocoa-rubbed beef.  The striped bass was good, but slightly overdone.  Overall, I enjoyed my experience, but was not as impressed as I hoped I would be."
My husband and I went here for dinner on a Saturday night last month. It was amazing! Everything delicious and lovely. Excited that this is right in Lincoln square area!
"Gather was a great experience start to finish. The host was incredibly friendly (big plus considering we were dressed VERY casually from a day time event) and seated us immediately without a reservation. Our waiter was also helpful with wine suggestions and helping us course out the meal. We ended up splitting the grilled octopus, which was tender and perfectly seasoned, steak tartar, which was very rich and tasty topped with an emulsified egg. We also split a generous portion of steamed mussels. The Apple Cobbler was a perfect capper to the night and the cinnamon ice cream was divine!"
"I literally lick my plate clean every time I come here.The ambiance is great. A wonderful place to come with friends to enjoy a bottle (or four, if you're like us) of delectable wine and share some plates of irresistible food. The whipped ricotta appetizer is amazing- I love the way they use honey to sweeten the cheese. Love the green beans, corn, tuna tar tar, halibut, EVERYTHING! I have not had one thing here that I haven't enjoyed until every last speck of garnish was gone. Let's not even talk about the peach and apple cobbler.... *drool. The drinks are phenomenal- my favorite is the Overnight Sensation- the berries are so yummy in the drink.The food and drinks aren't the only thing that make this place stand out- the decor and vibe of the place is very inviting and new. The outdoor patio area is so nice to hang with friends. It's getting a bit chillier out but the heaters kept us nice and toasty last time we went. It's in a prime location right in downtown Lincoln Square which is a fun area to explore. I definitely recommend this place for a date, Sunday family brunch/dinner, or just to kick it with friends."
"Gather is amazing. Everything about this place is amazing, from the friendly wait-staff to their delicious cocktail and great food. We went here for my daughter's first birthday, and were greeted by our lovely hostess who took our coats and seated us at our table. The house-made ricotta with honey comb is phenomenal, with just the right amount of sweetness and saltiness. The pumpkin soup was also phenomenal - nice and creamy with a delicious pumpkin flavor. For the entree, I had the fried chicken which was delicious as well. They also have an amazing list of cocktails. We tried two - the whisky smash and the count, and both were amazing. Highly recommend this place. We'll be coming again."
Oh my gosh. Run. Don't walk to Gather. I ate here a few nights ago and it was absolutely wonderful. The food was absolutely outstanding and the service was impeccable. I love my waitress but I forget what her name was. She was extremely knowledgable and was more than happy to answer all of my questions and work with me to make sure that I felt well taken care of. 10/10 will absolutely go back!
"We and our friends ended up at Gather on 'accident'.  We had a reservation at Bistro Campagne and decided we should switch it up and go somewhere new.  We were walking around and stopped by Gather.  We are so glad we did.  Everything about this place was great.  The host and server were nice and gracious.  The menu was focused but plenty. The atmosphere was cozy contemporary.  The drinks (Sidecar, Purple Sage, Rosé) were all good and well balanced.  We began with apps of Brussels sprouts (divine), and raviolio (rich and sinful).  For entrees we had a couple orders of Short rib and a Halibut.  I am the most finicky meat eater who loves a great short rib.  This was a SROAL Short Rib of a Lifetime - tender, lean, flavorful, and atop celery root slaw and a side of fab broccoli.  The halibut was light, perfectly seared, and fresh.  We had a concert to leave for but dessert will happen next time.  It was at Gather that I invented and gave out my first 'Arnold' award....'I'll Be Back'."
"This was one of the most disappointing meals I've had in this city.  For a couple months prior to my sister's birthday, I researched various restaurants, called and spoke with staff/managers, and based on that decided that Gather would be a great place for an intimate, special birthday dinner for my sister.  I made a reservation 6 weeks in advance, told them we were flexible on the time, double checked to make sure they could accommodate our group size, and just wanted to ensure a nice, enjoyable evening (and actually spoke with them several times on the phone in the weeks and days prior to the event).  Unfortunately our evening was anything but enjoyable.We arrived 10 minutes before our reservation and were informed their were still diners at our table.  That's fine, it happens (although I did talk to them several times and even mentioned we could move our time in order to avoid something like this).  We were asked to wait at the bar.  The bar consisted of a few seats (all occupied) with people dining at an open kitchen/bar area just behind it and a small one person-wide pathway for servers to go through between this!  I looked to the host to see if he was making a joke in trying to send our large group to this cramped and already occupied space, but he gave me a dead pan look and then walked away.  We then waited 45 minutes.  45 minutes!!!!  Gather is SMALL restaurant, and we stood awkwardly within tables, being shoved every few seconds by servers trying to get by.  It was unpleasant and we definitely felt in the way.  I suppose we could have waited outside in the subzero Chicago winter weather.When we were finally seated, the waitress immediately said, please hurry up and get your orders in before the kitchen closes.  I'm not sure why the kitchen was closing around 9pm on a Sat, and also why we were being rushed when we had spent the last 45 min standing awkwardly, apologizing every two seconds for being in someones way.  As rushed as we were to get in our order, they took about an hour after this to bring out even water/ drinks/ table bread (at this point we were famished) and each dish seemed to take an eternity with entirely too much time between them.  I understand that they are made to order and coursed out, but this was beyond slow.  We were in the back room which was not properly insulated so the temperature kept alternating from icy cold to a blast of scorching heat apx every 20 minutes. I had asked in advance if I could bring a birthday cake.  They charge a $36 cake cutting fee, so I opted to pre-order a dessert from their menu and ask that it be brought out with dessert menus for the other guests as well.  Halfway through our meal, a server came and plopped down the dessert at the end of the table (opposite from my sister) and said ""did someone order this?""  I was horrified.  The guests at the end of the table simply passed it down to us, and were never offered the option to order their own dessert, so shared the one for our table.Then our bill came.  With any large group, I ask if they will accept more than one form of payment, and if using multiple credit cards, I will list the credit card name with exact amount to charge next to it on the back of the receipt in hopes of making it easier.  I was attempting to do this for our waitress, and before I could, she goes ""yeah, yeah I got it"" and walked off.  Well of course she comes back with all sorts of incorrect charges: my card had only a random $8 charge, others were charged for the bulk of the meal, etc.  I explained this to her, and she actually berated us.  I've never been berated by a server, even at a desi restaurant. I am still shocked at how unexpectedly awful our experience was.  I hoped my sister would have a special, memorable experience for her birthday.  She instead had a birthday she will remember for feeling unwelcome, hungry, uncomfortable, and mistreated.  This was completely unexpected from this restaurant."
Amazing stuff.  Every dish had me craving for more of that flavor.  The portions are solid and most of the dishes are great for sharing if you want to got that route and try more items.  A wow in every bite.  And definitely a great value for what you get.
"My eight girlfriends and I decided to come here for a birthday brunch.  As I live in Lincoln Square, I made the reservations.  I felt like an instant friend with the man who took them and called back to confirm them the day before - very nice guy.  We had a large table reserved and ready for us in the back room, it was perfect!  We started with delicious, fresh mimosa options, strong coffee and decadent sweet rolls to share. Everyone loved their entrees as well - inventive, but not intimidating.  We never felt hurried along, even though we were there at the height of the rush - 10:30am on a Sunday.  I can't wait to return for a romantic dinner date with my hubby.  I just know it will be a special evening!"
"I'm kind of shocked by the number of 4 & 5 star reviews this place got.  It was definitely just alright when my friends and I went there.The service, while being knowledgable and nice, was extremely slow.  Our dinner took 3 hours without even trying to prolong it.  There was just so much time in between sitting down, placing orders, getting food, getting water or wine, getting the check, getting change, etc.The food was also just ok:The appetizers were the best by far.  We had the charcuterie board, the ricotta honey spread and chips/autumn dip.  All were great.The entrees were where the real issues lay (aside from service):  The cauliflower soup was the universally liked dish.The spinach gnocchi was awful.  It was too al dente and tasted like vinegar used for cleaning.The pasta was very good, but it was a small plate/appetizer portion, so those who ordered it were still hungry after eating.The fried chicken was fine.  Unfortunately, with average to poor entrees and slow service, I won't be back."
"The food at Gather is outstanding. By far, one of the best meals I've ever had, anywhere. We made last minute reservations on a Saturday night but we were still able to walk in a little early and sit right away. The patio in the back looked stunning. The bar is small, but looked like it would be comfortable enough to dine there. The kitchen had a lively chef's counter. The overall restaurant design is intimate and beautiful. The cocktails were flavorful, and the food was fresh and inventive. We ordered a handful of items on the menu so we could try a little bit of everything -- chilled corn and crab soup, heirloom tomato and burrata salad, ricotta and honey with toasted baguettes, yellowfin tuna tartare, jalapeno and white truffle ravioli, grilled corn with jalapeno and lime butter. I know some of this sounds similar to items you'd find at other restaurants, but Gather takes it to another level. All of the ingredients paired so well together.Gather is a great date spot, a great place to take out-of-towners and a great place to splurge with friends. I can't imagine anyone not enjoying the food and dining experience."
"Sunday brunch was our first visit, and we will be back.We were seated at the kitchen. What a fun show. Almost like watching a ballet. The food was fantastic, and lots of it.Service was great."
"One of my fave establishments in the area. The food is tasty and the service has always been really good. The menu is not terribly big and I have had pretty much everything on it so I am getting slightly bored. But nonetheless, it is still tasty. My faves on the menu are the whipped ricotta, the brussel sprouts, the arctic char and the half chicken. For drinks, I am a huge fan of the whiskey smash (so much so that the waitress ordered one for me before I even had my table). Also be sure to check out the brunch. The chicken fried biscuit (substitute pancakes for the biscuits) and the sweet potato hash are both my standbys for their brunch. And my girlfriends and I love the bellini's, the blood orange mimosas and the bloody mary's."
"We came here for the Chief of Staff's birthday, and it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great.  Here are the positives, the food is quite tasty, the entrees and appetizers.  The food timing is excellent, all courses arrived served at the same time for all four diners at the table, all just prepared. Their menu is carefully designed so that dishes take the same amount of time to prepare, you can watch and be as impressed as I was at the precisely coordinated four chef system (actually one is a coordinator I think), it's as punctilious as ballet.  Wine selection is good.  Service is both friendly and competent. Then there are the negatives, well, maybe I should call them, the not-so-positives, as they aren't fully negative, just, not so positive. They are actually quite connected to the positives.  The reason for the precision in the kitchen is the cramped space.  The kitchen is very small, the one in my house is bigger. The chefs have to be coordinated or someone would literally get burned.  The staff uniform is casual shirts and jeans, so they look like half the customers (younger than the other half), they don't even wear aprons or other identifiers, you don't really know who they are. A couple of times I just thought it was strange that some young customer wanted to know if I ""needed any help,""  or if I was ""enjoying myself.""  The prices are high enough for a special occasion place, but for celebrating an adult birthday, I would like the service to be at least as formally dressed as I am.  The portions are small, whether you're ordering the ""gather""  appetizers meant to be shared, or the individual appetizers, or the entrees.  I'm glad I got to try all three out, and since there were four of us, I got to sample much of their limited but carefully chosen menu. It's all good (as they say) but you do have to order a gather, an appetizer, an entree and a side, and that all adds up.  I don't mind paying the price for an elegant restaurant, and although the food is at that quality, the space and staff presentation are not.  The spacing is closer than cozy, it's tight, so it's loud, a tad claustrophobic.  For me, it's not really relaxing, not really luxurious, and I now know a bit too much about the personal lives of the couple who were seated at the table to my right."
5 stars might be a bit high but when I try to think about something I don't enjoy about this cute restaurant it's tough. The food is always delicious and the menu changes enough to keep things interesting at the same time keeping those favorites you come back for. The staff always makes me feel like a regular and is warm and inviting.  I enjoy the decor and the ambiance of the kitchen being open making this spot almost feel like you are at home. When the weather warms up the patio out back is romantic and is just a wonderful spot to share a cocktail or a few small plates. All in all this might be a biased review from a neighborhood local but I've always enjoyed my visits to this spot.
"Hit up Gather on a Monday evening.  Really good price points and quality entrees with healthy portions. I suggest sitting at the bar in front of the kitchen on a slower night, as you will be immersed in the full experience.  I will return here."
Delicious food with perfect portion size.....your mother will not have to bribe you to eat these Brussel sprouts...yum
"Went there with a group of four. Nice atmosphere. Probably good for dates as well, though might be a little noisy depending on night. The apple salad and brussel sprout appetizers were very good. The short rib entree was cooked to perfection, and even the broccoli side was wonderfully flavored (roasted?). The fact that they can take vegetables that a lot of people don't like and make them fantastic, is a testament to how great this place is. I would definitely go back again."
"We literally just got back from having dinner at Gather and it was so good that I had to write a review immediately.  It was the kind of meal that made me want to run home and write a review.  We live right down the street and have always wanted to go, but for one reason or another had never made it in.  I'm so glad that we finally got here.  We didn't have a reservation, but we figured we would just wait for a table while we had a drink at the bar.  We got there at around 7:45 and were told it would be a wait for a regular table, but that there were two seats at the kitchen table ready right away.  So basically, we sat at a bar right in front of the kitchen and got to watch the chefs prepare the food.  My husband and I were all about that because we both love to cook.  Ken, the chef who was right in front of us, was exceptional-so nice and extremely generous when it came to letting us try almost everything he was preparing, whether it was something we had ordered or not.  We sampled freshly toasted marshmallows and halibut purree on toasted baguette, both excellent.  I could have eaten my weight in the brussels sprouts appetizer, it was so delicious.  The miso glaze in it was amazing.  They were perfecty cripsy and the pistachios gave the dish a nice crunch.  I had the Halibut appetizer as my meal, and it melted in my mouth.  My husband had the burger, and that was also cooked perfectly.  After we took care of the bill, the waiter asked if we had five minutes, then proceeded to give us a complete dessert on the house-fritters topped with ice cream and caramel sauce.  So nice of him.  Just overall, such an incredible meal.  Before our dinner was over, my husband and I were talking about when to come back.  The host was accommodating, our waitress was nice and super quick, and the waiter was awesome.  I highly recommend this place and cannot wait to go back."
"My wife and I have been to Gather twice; unfortunately, our second experience makes me reluctant to go again.Our first trip, we made a reservation, and were seated promptly. The space is well done, but a bit small; if you have to wait there is very little room to stand. We had a flat bread, the half chicken, and a pork dish (which appears to no longer be on the menu). The food was very good, and the service was very friendly. Combined with a great atmosphere, we were excited to go back.Our second trip there, my wife again got the chicken; unfortunately, it came out raw inside 2 of the fried pieces. While she only took one bite and did not get sick, the waitress seemed confused as to what to do with it, scraping it off the plate with her fork then not offering new utensils. They did cook her a new dish (which was not raw) but after being served raw chicken, the experience at Gather has been ruined for us."
"What an experience! I spent years working in fine dining, so I know how much effort it takes to make it work. I can tell you, the folks at Gather have it DOWN. The chefs there are true geniuses with an obvious love for their art. All of the staff showed real pride in their work, they have a fine-tuned their attention to detail and they never missed a beat. The food simply could not be any better and the wine pairings were spot on! Bravo Gather!"
"There are not many times I go out to eat and have such an excellent experience. My wife and I went early on a Saturday night without a reservation and were seated at the counter facing the kitchen where we watched the chefs cook our meals which was super interesting to watch the ebb and flow of meal orders coming in. For appetizer we had roasted cauliflower and gnocchi that had great flavors and textures. Mains we had scallops (juicy and plump) and chicken (two pieces cooked different ways) that were both great. Desert we shared an ice cream with caramel sauce that was delicious. For the quality the price is very reasonable. Our server was attentive and professional. Ambience and feel of subtle sophistication, not at all pretentious. My only knocks would be the whites (timid choices for such interesting food) I had were just OK and the cocktail was light on for booze. Though minor complaints for what would be my best meal since moving to Chicago four years ago."
"Great Place!  We sat at one of the bar seats overlooking the kitchen, and it was a really cool experience.  The chefs are young and very skilled at what they do.  Brussels sprouts are amazing - bonito flakes make the dish.  The burger was also one of the best I've ever had.. and I think it was made with what tasted like really quality american cheese.. not sure.. but the flavor balance was perfection! The bar does good cocktails too, they have some New Orleans classics - Sazerac was excellent!!"
"Was super excited to try this place for V-day with some friends.  The cocktails were the best part of the meal (sadly).  They offered a great selection of signature and specialty cocktails.  The moscow mule and the count were both delicious.  As for the food, I wasn't blown away.  From the gather and share selection we had the whipped ricotta which was good, but on the sweeter side and served with delicious homemade bread.  The steak tartare was the best thing I ate all night.  The combination with the egg and capers gave this dish a great combo of flavors.  We also all shared the mussels which were good, but I have to say the IPA left an odd aftertaste in the broth.  I've had better mussels elsewhere :(From the appetizers portion I shared the market greens which was the 2nd best thing I ate - the hazelnuts and provoletta really added some flare to the greens and the dressing was the perfect choice.  The Uovo Raviolo had great potential, but the flavors didn't come together.  I could taste the creaminess of the egg, but the jalapeno took over the entire bite drowning out the truffle butter.  My friends tried the winter squash soup and while I like squash, in soup form, the flavors did not come together as it was sweetly spiced and a bit odd tasting.  Also 2 friends enjoyed the meat and cheese plate, but I feel these boards are available anywhere and don't really highlight the execution of a restaurant given the cheese and meats could not have been made in-house necessarily.I think this place has hope as it's a great space with fabulous decor.  Hopefully they can get it right."
Excellent local establishment in North Center. Nice decor and very good food and drink options. We had dinner outside in the covered patio area. Worth checking out.
"I enjoyed gathering at Gather. I can definitely see myself strolling over to this fine establishment in the summer. It houses the old LM space. It's not a huge place, but it's sleek in its decor. It can also get quite busy and loud but if you go a little earlier, you can avoid some of this. You'll want to call for a reservation.  We were a table of four. We ordered a a few small plates to start. The whipped ricotta was great and I'd gladly order this again. The pork belly was also quite good but the favorite for me was the brandade. A spread of cream, potato and salted cod served with potato blinis, lemon confit and roasted garlic spread. I was disappointed to learn that the porchetta was taken off the menu so I ordered its replacement - diver scallops with braised oxtail. It's served with pickled veg and a cake of chickpeas and oxtail. I did not detect any oxtail in the cake and could have done without this component all together but the scallop and oxtail were nicely done. I felt the portion was a little on the small side but was satisfied. I also tried the burger and while good, felt you could get a better burger elsewhere. Now, the desserts were great. The frozen chocolate cake was a hit and the sticky buns amazing. Gather also has a nice cocktail menu as well. The service for the most part was pretty good although there was a bit of a lag between our apps and entree due to a party in the back of the restaurant. We we're given a head's up in advance, so no worries. All in all an enjoyable experience and a welcome edition to Lincoln Square."
"In my opinion, this restaurant is the best you'll find in Lincoln Square. I've come here on several occasions and always found their food to be fresh and delicious. The food isn't the only great thing about Gather though. Every time I've eaten here the server has always been really knowledgeable about the food and really friendly.  Looking forward to coming back soon!"
"Alright, I was lucky enough to try lots from the menu and I can say quite matter of factly that I looooooooooooove this place. So happy to live so close! For appetizers we shared green beans with chili frito (my favorite-they were blanched and sauteed, leaving the perfect crunch!) mussels (mounds!!!), steak tartare and a three beet salad with mini goat cheese balls. For entrees I tasted the scallops and I had the whitefish with sausage and grits. It was a bit rich for a hot night, but still delicious! It seemed like everyone wanted to go sit out on the patio, but we took advantage of the AC. They have a great counter to sit and watch the chefs from, so if you're into that kind of thing I'd call ahead to reserve that space. Patrick (?) was a friendly server with lots of great recommendations for our meal. He was busting his butt making cocktails and serving tables, but never seemed frazzled. Go get a homemade wine cooler and enjoy your summer. :)"
"Loved it! Had the whipped ricotta and brussel sprout apps, short ribs for entrée and apple fritters for dessert. All great.  The roasted broccoli that came with the entrée were nothing I've tasted before.  Could've had a plateful. Atmosphere was nice. Service was my only negative and it wasn't offensive.  They made us wait to be seated until full party was there even though there were plenty of open tables.  The waitress was also not as attentive as she could've been.  I would've had another glass of wine but she disappered for about 20 min.  But she knew the menu and food came out at a goid pace. I will definitely be back."
"Creative food, good service, and a fun time. The layout with multiple bar/kitchen seating areas really sets up a good communal vibe. Small plates with layered flavors encourage sharing...and a solid wine list with lots of good choices at different price points."
"My mom and I came here on a Tuesday night.  The food we had was excellent, it's just that it took a VERY long time to get there.  I know there are quite a few reviews saying the same thing.  I don't expect nor want ""fast"" food but this was painfully slow.  Another comment I have is that the front dining area's music was ridiculously loud.  I can tolerate loudish music but this was excessive.  We had to ask to sit outside bc between the music, the people and the small space you could barely hear yourself think."
"Gather is a fantastic addition to Lincoln Square!  My husband and I dined here last night and had a wonderful time. Service was outstanding; our server was very knowledgeable and appropriately attentive. I have to say that Chef Ken's burger is definitely one of the best in town. I could eat this delicious dish every night of the week. We also had the whipped ricotta, brussel sprouts, and the new steak entree (which was super tasty). Gather definitely has put their mark on the neighborhood and I can't wait to try brunch!"
"After the long winter, Gather turned out to be the perfect place to enjoy the first outdoor dining experience of Spring. Conveniently located near the Western Brown Line stop, the store front of Gather is pretty unassuming. Don't be fooled though, because this place has a fabulous covered outdoor dining area in the back Our service was exceptional--we had a very well-informed server who was also very kind and welcoming (a rare combination). The cocktails were not only unique, but pretty enough that they deserved a picture. The food was excellent as well. In fact, I lost my brussel sprout virginity at Gather and could not be happier about it! After a lifetime of avoiding brussel sprouts, I found the sprouts at Gather completely tasty and nothing like brussel sprouts' reputation. In short, Gather has a great atmosphere, novel cocktails, and delicious food. It is rare to find all those things in the same place, but you can at Gather."
"Been here twice--beautiful little place. Great cocktails (try the negroni) and some gorgeous food. Braised short ribs: amazing. Our first visit, we sat at the bar overlooking the kitchen for a nice theatrical view of the proceedings."
"Oh. My. Goodness.  I love this place!  I like this entire area.  When I came to Gather (I wish I could remember what I ordered) I was smitten with how 'happy' it seemed in there.  Lot's of hustling, loud chatter (but I didn't mind) and looking around the crowd seemed happy, joyful and stylish.  Our waitress was attentive, but not pushy and the dinner was well paced.  I'm actually looking at moving to this area now that I've had so much fun here.  This is a great date place, but I can also seeing it be perfect for a family dinner or girl's night out."
"Great wine selection, food was very good but not amazing (hence the 4 stars vs 5 stars).  I feel like once this place finds it's identity it will move up to 5 stars and match the prices that are on the menu.  For now I will wait and see."
"I was excited to try Gather, I really wanted it to be great, however it falls a bit short of great for now.Pro's-*Great restaurant layout*Friendly attentive service*location is greatCon's-*Slow - our dinner was 3 hours long, the kitchen needs to move much faster, there was a 45 minute gap in between appetizers and entree's.The food was so so, nothing overwhelming and the menu is kind played out throughout the current dining scene. The whipped ricotta was seperating, still tasted good but nothing special. The brussel sprouts were decent, a bit heavy on the balsamic though, still good. The desert menu is too small and focuses manly on tea selections, taking up most of the menu. Perhaps adding a cheese option and some desert cocktails or wine would be a good idea.  Also, a special menu would be a good idea to add some new ideas in to try out.I want Gather to get better! I will be back when it does.p.s. the bathrooms are confusing, why do I have to take 10 seconds to figure out which is which,  what ever happened to M and W?? Three people in line all agreed."
"We showed up for a late Friday dinner.  It was spur of the moment to celebrate some good news at work, so we didn't have a reservation.  Luckily they hold half of their tables for walk-in business.  They were able to seat us immediately.For starters, there are 2 different routes you can take.  One part of the menu has larger plates that are intended to be shared at the table.  The other part is smaller appetizers.  We went with the ramp board.  It contained grilled, pickled, and ramp chutney along with hours made focaccia.  My main course was the diver scallops with ox tail (wine pairing was perfect based on our server's recommendation).  My girlfriend had the chicken dish and she was quite pleased as well.  Honestly, everything on the menu looked really tasty.We finished up with the frozen chocolate cake with homemade peanut butter.  So decadent.The entire experience was just right.  I plan to return soon"
"I have been looking forward to eating here and I was not let down.Atmosphere is very comfortable. Great spot to dine with friends or have a date.Food was spectacular. Right up my alley. Great seasonal items, everything made in house, and an open view of the kitchen.Try the cocktails (and wine). Perfectly crafted Old Fashioned. Service was also stellar. Our server (Stephanie) was great at recommending both food and drink items.Make it a point to ""gather"" here."
"I can't even begin to say enough about the service! Our waitress was amazing- her recommendations were spot on -from the wine to the cocktails to the food! But, what really stood put was how accommodating to food allergies they were! Bravo! How great to have such a talented chef, care enough to let all patrons enjoy their meal from start to finish! And boy did we give him a run for his money...1 vegetarian and one gluten free diner! Thank you again for such delicious food and attentive service! We will be back!"
"My husband and I decided to dine at Gather on a Friday night to celebrate our 1 week anniversary.  We postponed our honeymoon, so we wanted to do a low key celebration.  The back patio was covered, which was nice because it started to rain during dinner.  We opted to try the cocktails and shared each plate.  The food was so good that we decided to venture back again only a week after!  The staff is knowledgable, and ambiance is great, and the food was definitely worth two trips.  A must try."
"This really is as good as it gets. Service, cocktails and food were all excellent. The staff could not have been more knowledgeable about both the food and drink. The house cocktails were well-balanced and fairly-priced ($10 each). But try the martini, too, and don't order it dry. They mix 'em the old-fashioned way with fresh vermouth and it adds wonderful flavors to the mix.For dinner, we tried the cauliflower, steak tartare, brussel sprouts, hamachi crudo, mussels, and swordfish and shared it all. The fish was perfectly cooked and was the only actual entrée we got. The rest of the dishes were appetizers but not too small like at a fake tapas / ""small plate"" restaurant (i.e. reasonable prices to match!).Ambiance was nice, too. It was not too loud, but when we were there early on a Thursday evening it was not yet full, either. There's a back patio that I can't wait to try when the weather gets warm.If, as described by some below, there were issues with slow service a few weeks ago when the place opened, there was no trace of that when we dined (it's not the golden nugget though, either!)."
"We came here last night to celebrate my husbands birthday! Food was an excellent 5! Service was good. BUT the only reason I'm giving it a four: I wrote in my reservations we were celebrating a birthday. I even told them as I went to the bathroom, it was my husbands birthday. Thinking they would bring him a candle or something........and they just brought us the check. I was not happy about that. ....There were a total of four of us. We ordered five drinks, four, yes four appetizers and four entrees. Price was 200 including the tip. We ordered the octopus, the tomatoes, the gathering board, and the gnocchi . All were amazing but the gnocchi was incredible! Everything was so fresh and made with a lot of thought behind it. For the entrees, I had a hamburger and it was the lightest burger I've ever had. Meaning it was a big thick juicy burger but it felt very light and not heavy. My husband had the scallops and he loved them. I had a bite and it was very tasty. Our brother in law also had the chicken and it was amazing! We will come here again as we liked the vibe. Just wish they listened to me when I told them not once, but twice that it was my husbands birthday!!"
