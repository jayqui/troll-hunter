The Local Chicago
"Really liked this place!  Thought it was part of the Hilton but come to discover that it is independent from the hotel.  Generally don't like to eat in chain hotels.Had the prime filet breakfast which was very tasty and well prepared and my only gripe was the the portion which really was tiny for 26.  Had a bite of daughters TLC burger and that was large and tasty.  Fresh squeezed OJ was tasty but could have been colder.Staff here was great, very helpful and accomodating.  Will come back!"
"We stayed at the Hilton hotel and were hungry before going to bed. So we went to the Local downstairs. The food was really good! We got the fish and chips and my brother got the TLC burger. The food came in large portions - my girlfriend and I split the fish and chips and it was plenty of food for the both of us. At first I thought the food was really overpriced - but the quality of the food and the amount of food served made up for it. The service was terrible, which is why I am not giving it 4 stars. Our waiter was incredibly rude and never asked if we wanted refills and we felt as if we were bothering him the whole time. All we wanted was for him to do his job, but it seemed as if he was angry with us the entire time even though we were polite throughout our meal. Also, they don't give you enough ketchup. They fill the cup not even half way and we had to ask several times for more ketchup and each time he brought a cup that was barely full. Boo that waiter. Props to the chef."
"Staff is fantastic, food is mediocre, ambiance is fun - this is for dinner and after hours. Staff gets it all the stars.Don't go for breakfast, no bueno - better for drink appetizers on the evening."
"Very cozy and unpretentious restaurant with lots of comfort food. Coveys a very neighborhood, local feel that is good for a nightcap, dinner or just a bar to stop and watch a game before heading home. We stopped for dinner and everything we ordered was good. I had a burger with fries, and side salad and everything was good. Nothing fancy but all good. The service was prompt and friendly. Next time I would love to try breakfast here."
"Good food but AMAAAAZING service. Our waitress was cracking us up!! The place is big, clean, well lit, and the workers are great.Kinda pricey for breakfast though. But j have to say, the Belgian waffle and the hasbrowns are awesome."
Good service and good food. Nice selection of beers! Jalapeño corn bread is definitely worth trying.
"Not really as great as Yelp makes it out to be. I went for lunch and had a sampling of everything - soup, salad, and sandwich. Sandwich and salad were subpar, but the chicken noodle soup was absolutely excellent. The waiter was friendly, but sparse and took a long time to take our orders despite the restaurant being empty aside from two other tables. For the location and the price, you can do much better than The Local."
Ugh worst breakfast/lunch place ever. It's called the local but all the food tastes like it got exported from IHOP. I'm pretty sure my smoked chicken omelette came from a carton and my boyfriends basic egg plate was unappetizing as well. Never again.
"Visited Chicago at the end of March and got to experience some snow. That is awesome to a Las Vegan, but my thin desert blood can't handle it. Needed to pop into a place and drink to warm up.We were very happy to stumble into this place. Although we were not going to be eating here, the drinks and the customer service made this a perfect place for us.It is attached to a hotel and some of the clientele were quite a bit older than us. The bartenders remembered everybody's name that came in and out of there, which provided a more regular or local atmosphere (LOCAL IS IN THE NAME!)Super attentive service, a couple of local brews on tap, and access to clean bathrooms made this a perfect place for us to grab a drink. Our bartender gave us so many tips on places to see (and places we actually wanted to check out, not just tourist traps). I can tell when bartenders or wait staff are being forceful in their customer service, but the service and helpfulness came from sincerity."
"I'm from Vegas and was on a trip to Chicago. We missed the warm weather by a week and we're suffering from below freezing temperatures on an otherwise beautiful day. Stopped by in this place just to warm up with a beer.We didn't order any food but the beers on tap were interesting. They had many local flavors, like Goose Island, on tap as well as others. I myself had a Domaine DuPage French Style Country Ale from Two Brothers Brewing. The bartender helped me out with several samples. The bartender was definitely the star of the show. Once he heard that we were from out of town, he was quick to offer suggestions for places to go. He mentioned going down to California and Milwaukee for the Hipsters, even told us the Blue Line would take us. Talked about Timothy O Toole, the bar we needed to check out and the Bellweather for eats. He was so helpful.The nice thing was that, he remembered other people that would walk in. That kind of attention to detail, that atmosphere was really inviting and refreshing. Don't have a ton of that in Vegas, so to see such a helpful place was great to find. Check this place out, the service is amazing."
"The food and service were excellent. We had the mussels appetizer, the Cioppino stew, the marinated skirt steak, and a chocolate chip cookie for dessert."
"Great rib eye, great Cobb salad and very good chicken pot pie. All that plus 2 cokes $65 +tip."
"Not the slightest bit impressed. The pot roast was passable and the chicken was rubbery. We were seated outside on a beautiful night but the table was warped kind of like a hill. When the drinks were set down, they looked as if they were about to fall off."
Their prime rib filet mignon breakfast with poached eggs was delish! We were starving and wasn't able to take a picture of it. Quality of meat and the way they prepared our medium rare steak was perfect. We had a funny/friendly server as well.
Everything was great (especially the pot pie) except the scary clown at the bar. Why is that a thing!? Im going to have nightmares of that clown.
I went to a lunch place for supper and their supper menu was a lunch menu but expensive.  I had punched in steak places on Yelp and this placed was top of the list.  I would say in all seriousness this is not a steak place.  It serves a steak and it was an 8oz fillet for $37.00 ala carte.  I would have been happier if I ordered their $20 hamburger because I think it comes with French fries.Mrs. K. ordered the fish and chips and said it was one of the better fish and chips she has had.  I had a taste and it was very good.Here is what we hadPetite FilletFish and Chipsbaked potatosoup two 6 oz cokes.$87 before tip.Dang if got the burger it would have been like $67.
"My husband and I went here for Breakfast our first day in Chicago. We stayed on Michigan and Chicago and it was about a 10-15min walk. The restaurant was clean and cute, very 4th of July themed in a way. Anyway I had the chorizo taco that were absurdly delicious, a little heavy on my stomach because we had breakfast so early but delicious none the less. My husband had the classic two eggs with bacon and hash browns. He loves his as well, heir his eggs over medium and he said they were cooked perfectly! The hash browns were amazing! I still some from him!! Our server and service was awesome, I definitely recommend this restaurant!!!"
"I LOVE Chicago, and especially The Local.  This a such an awesome spot for late night eats, I flew in from SF starving, and Sean and crew took care of me.  I ordered the mussel appetizer and added fettuccine based on the best server in Chicago's  suggestion, and wow.  Thanks for the tip and the good care Sean!!"
"Had lunch here and will definitely be back soon. Andrew was our server and he was great, very attentive and helpful with the menu.I had the TLC burger which was one of the best burgers I have ever eaten.  Lots of flavor, cooked perfectly and juicy.My wife had the fried chicken sandwich which was also very good and flavorful.Outstanding service, food, and atmosphere."
"Decent but for the price I would expect better... the chicken noodle soup appeared to be the best thing on the menu. So far it is the highest price we have paid for lunch by nearly double and no where near the best. We are staying downtown and have found cheaper and better ""local"" food establishments for lunch.Get the chicken noodle soup and leave it at that but you will still be out $30+/couple for soup!"
"Collin; the manager, hooked us up with a reservation and even seated us when we showed up early because we under estimate how far it was from our hotel.Service was great.The tortilla soup was tasty as reported by two other folks with me and I feel the same.Chicken pot pie... the pastry on top was fantastic, the contents were too soupy, and it watered it down far too much.  I'm used to a CPP that is much thicker.Several folks had the chocolate mouse to their great satisfaction.  This is a 'thick' variant, but very, very rich from the one taste I took.I'd go back again."
"My waitress couldn't care less about my lactose intolerance. I came in with my group on Saturday for lunch and asked about the ingredients on the menu which she proceeded to give me a gluten-free menu that she said also 'works' for dairy allergies. I was confused and asked her if that means that the chocolate mousse under desserts is made without dairy which she brushed away and said yes. She obviously didn't care. I tried to order an item from that menu and then she said it was no longer being served. I gave up on the gluten free menu that she was insisting me to use and asked her to ask the kitchen about a couple of items from the regular menu. When I was finally able to make my order, I kindly asked her to make sure the order came without cheese. She served the salad to me with cheese which she took back to the kitchen for a second and they took out the cheese from the top. I could still see bits of it in the salad but I was annoyed I had to not eat my salad. I would never come back even if I had a different waitress bc the manager was there but never came to my table to help the clueless waitress with my ordering."
"Very overpriced and overrated. This a hotel restaurant which I didn't realize until I was seated inside. My bad guys. I should have managed my expectations accordingly. I sprung for the lobster eggs benedict. The lobster was sparse and not high quality. The accompanying potato cake was the best thing on the plate. Just get a couple of those and a bowl of fruit and call it breakfast! The buffet was expansive but $$$ as well. Find a better joint, especially if you are dining with kids, my breakfast was $25 for my benedict and a cup of coffee."
"Food was great!  I like the idea that most, if not everything, is locally sourced from nearby areas.  Definitely worth a try if you're downtown and near Hancock/Water Tower, and want to avoid a chain restaurant."
"Went for breakfast on our last morning in Chicago.  They offered a breakfast buffet or items off of their standard menu.  The buffet had a good variety, but it was in all honestly no better than a free breakfast you would get at a Hampton Inn or its equivalent.  My husband had to ask that new pancakes be put out, because the ones on the buffet were burned.  I had lobster eggs benedict, and it was alright, but nothing specacular.  The portion sizes for the prices were adequate but nothing to write home about.  Perhaps lunch or dinner is better."
"We stopped by this place for a quick bite to eat while walking downtown. We passed by it after going to the water tower and thought it looked like a cute little restaurant. From the outside it looks like a cheap little diner, however, when you go inside you get a little confused. The tables were set like any upscale restaurant, however, they had American flags and the waiters and waitresses were dressed in jeans and t-shirts which gave the feel of a county fair. Then they had pie and rotisserie chicken in plain view which reminds me of a diner. It doesn't seem like this restaurant knows they theme they want to portray. With the food, they went with very upscale prices. I got the chicken and was extremely pleased with my choice. It was very good. It seems this restaurant is known for their chicken so if you go here the chicken is a must. However, my boyfriend got the turkey club and it was very plain with little flavor. This turkey club was about $15; much too expensive what they offer. The service was excellent and we loved our waiter. He was knowledgeable on the beer offered and gave us great recommendations. He was attentive without being overbearing and honestly that is my favorite kind of service. Overall I wouldn't go here again. There are better restaurants very close to the area. You honestly would only have to walk 5 mins or less before you get to Michigan Ave and will probably find something better and reasonably priced there."
"I have been here a few times and each time I feel tricked. LOL...so this time I decided to write a review so I can remember my experience. Place is cute and they have a little outdoor seating area, which is nice. Service has always been super friendly as well. Now for the bad part...the food. The items I have had thus far have been really bland. On one occasion I had the meat loft...bland and this past weekend I had the turkey burger...extra bland. It's like their making the food for people that really need to watch their cholesterol and not adding any spices or flavor at all. The saving grace is the dessert. I remember once I had the pineapple upside down cake and it was delicious and on my last visit I had the chocolate cookies, which were pretty good and very reasonably priced. The drinks are also okay, but nothing to write home about. Not saying I won't be back, but not someplace I would go out of my way to get to."
"I think they're trying too hard to be something they're not.  They have upscale prices, but servers are wearing jeans and aprons.  It's a bit confusing.  The restaurant is in a hotel, so that might be why it's overpriced.In their fairness the food and service were very good.  For the price, I would probably go elsewhere.  There are so many good restaurants in the area.  Overall it was a good dinner though.  No complaints."
"I've been to The Local a few times now and it never disappoints, but my most recent experience was so good that I felt the need to share. Went there for a special occasion and our server, Andrew, was AMAZING. Personable, helpful and really went the extra mile to make sure that my wife and I had a great meal, which we did. The food was exceptional, the jalapeño cornbread is a must and we ended our night with Bourbon pecan pie. Great beer list and just a great environment. Thank you to Andrew and the entire staff for making our most recent visit a very memorable one."
"Andrew was a great waiter and everything we ordered was delicious! Jalapeño cornbread, burrata salad and steak sandwich - mmmm :)"
"Solid, but a bit overpriced with spotty service.Stopped in here after abandoning our plans to go to the Signature Room for brunch. Ended up grabbing brunch, and enjoyed everything we ordered. Turkey burger was amazing, my husband enjoyed his rib-eye sandwich. Our daughter had the kids pancake meal and loved it. The bacon here is delicious.  We ordered a bottle of white wine to enjoy, and while the wine was nice, our server just was so awkward with the refilling of our glasses. It was borderline uncomfortable...he would either keep us waiting with empty glasses, or arrive after we replenished our glasses ourselves and would pour a couple drops into each fullglass to top us off. Bizarre.I wouldn't make a special trip to come here, but if you are in the area, its a nice, peaceful refuge from the chaos a couple blocks over. I imagine the patio is lovely in better weather."
"Even though The Local is located in a hotel it actually is pretty local. Came in recently for dinner and drinks with a few friends and we ended up chatting with some regulars that lived in the neighborhood. Nice folks that fit the vibe of an overall pretty chill spot. Yeah there are some tourists, but the blank doesn't exactly attract the obnoxious out of towner like some of the other hotels in this hood do. It's a pretty safe spot for a family meal, drinks with your dad, or professional meet up all the same. They got a great crab cake, the martinis are fantastic when dirty, and the two young ladies who served us were incredibly sweet rounding out an overall pretty excellent experience. I'll definitely be back to The Local."
"This review is based on weekend brunch.Food in general is ok. We had full breakfast buffet.Omelet was included so ordered egg white spinch mushroom omelet. Omlete took about 25 mins and it came in regular not white egg. We took it because didn't want to wait again.Buffet stations are small only four of hot food and salad fruit stations.Most of hot food like bacon, pancakes had been out almost forty minutes. I was close to cancel my buffet....If you ever go here for breakfast, jist order individual dish."
"Completely overrated on yelp. Definitely wouldn't come back here. We all ordered the American breakfast and it was just okay for the price. Had to send back the scrambled eggs because they were poured from a carton with creme and were not real. We didn't know this until after we ordered. Service was good, but doesn't make up for the lack luster food. Would have rather paid a little more for a decent breakfast. Wouldn't recommend."
"I live around the block from this place and it's become a Local favorite in the neighborhood (pun intended). Why you ask? The comfortable home-y atmosphere, the hours (open until 2am!), the creative cocktails (+full bar), and of course: the food. It's a great place to bring the family, or just a friend to sit at the bar and watch sports with.What to eat: Jalapeño Corn bread - try it at least once.Skirt steak - was delicious, but even the next day when I had the left overs for breakfast mixed with scrambled eggs.Kobe Beef Hot Dog - it's bigger than you think.Ahi Tuna BurgerI'd say avoid the 8oz steak. It's the most expensive thing on the menu, and you'll be disappointed with it as soon as it comes out - it's just a piece of meat on a plate with no sides.Enjoy!"
"First off, A++ to whomever hires the folks who work here. Everyone is extremely helpful, articulate and polite. Not to mention, the male servers are definitely a tall drink of water. The food was pretty impressive for a restaurant attached to a hotel. My friends and I stayed at a hotel around the corner from this restaurant and found it so convenient to pop over for a late dinner (restaurant closes at 2am). The Mac n cheese is delish, the cornbread was a favorite with our entire group, the stuffed dates are a must try. If you're into spicy definitely try the blood orange margarita. Highly recommend :)"
"Meh. Mediocre at best. Pricy, slow service, and food was just okay. Good quality ingredients were tasted, but weak presentation. Read many good reviews, I guess lunch was not the time to come in. Had the ribeye sandwich."
"Fantastic!  We are a family with 11yo, 9, and 7 yo.  Great atmosphere, staff was great.  Food terrific.  If you are looking for a nice casual place with great food, this is it.  I wish we had one in our hometown.  We spent four nights in Chicago and went here twice!"
Not too amazed with The Local. I came here for dinner mainly because of the yelp reviews and it was close to my hotel. First I was sat by the hostess who put me a a table outside covered with dirt and bugs. I asked to sit at a different table and the hostess looked at me like I was crazy for wanting to sit somewhere else. The waitress was nice and very attentive.  But the food was the main problem. Not very good and parts of it tasted old. The coleslaw was absolutely disgusting. I literally spit it out of my mouth and had to rinse with water.
We had breakfast here. I like that the menu doesn't overwhelm you with options! The food was good and presented nicely. This place was very busy but the waitstaff is very attentive--even other servers or bussers not assigned to your table would happily check on us when our own server was occupied with other patrons. We will definitely visit again!
Very good place.  Upper end of $$ but highly worth it. Prime meatloaf special was outstanding.
"Loved the ambiance! The food was delicious and the signature drinks were great. The staff was very friendly. This place is located within the Hyatt and we definitely felt a tad underdressed,but would definitely go back."
"Stopped in for lunch and was impressed. The bacon wrapped dates were sweet and yum. The chicken drumettes were spot on. The manager, Ryan, had me try the goat cheese...so good and elevated. Service by bartender and manager added to a great experience. A little high price, but worth it."
"We went for thanksgiving dinner this year while on vacation in Chicago.  After looking all day for a place that served traditional thanksgiving meal, we ended up here. The food was absolutely delicious!  The thanksgiving dinner consisted of 3 entries for a fix price. I had a pumpkin soup, turkey and mashed potatoes and a pumpkin pie.  Although, we can't review their usual food, I must say the restaurant was cozy and  the staff were very attentive. I took a look at the menu and it was a little pricey. However, I'll definitely go again when I get back to Chicago."
"So as other folks have said, The Local is attached to a hotel.  So what?  Go anyway!  I will say that it is somewhat expensive.  I ate the pork belly sliders with quail egg and fennel slaw.  Perfect blend of flavors and  if you like pork belly you'll love these!  The service is phenomenal.  I had so much attention!  One of the appetizers are bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with goat cheese.  After my delicious sliders, I wanted one.  Just one.  Five are in a serving.  I asked, and lo and behold, I got my single bacon wrapped date!  I perfect ending to my meal!"
"You're visiting Chicago. After a long, fruitful day spent in designer shops on Michigan Avenue, you're tired of snotty sales people and very, very hungry. If you want to relax, suck down a succulent cocktail and enjoy a dinner downtown without the tension of pretension, then walk a block east to The Local - Chicago. Right around the corner from the fancy stores on Chicago's Magnificent Mile, this enjoyable little place is waiting just for you. Think ""sports bar"" without a bunch of loud frat boys in jerseys. Think ""urban cousin of a small town café.""The Local - Chicago is attached to a fancy hotel, but don't let that scare you away.  Surrounded by curio Americana, you can watch sports on the muted, unobtrusive large screen television, listen to the tasteful, not-too-loud background music, or just sit back and enjoy the charming regulars chatting, hugging and laughing as they drink at the inviting bar.Small town charm, yes, but we're not talking a southern bubba hangout. We're talking salt of the earth, Midwestern restaurant; a cozy yet fancy neighborhood hangout where locals gather and tourists unwind. The staff fits right in with the motif. Lovely hostesses greet you at the door. Kenny makes sure you have water the minute you sit down, and bring you lime, if you like. As for the servers ... I was especially impressed. Handsome, all-American ""football star"" types (OMG ladies, if you're out for a girls night, ask for Ryan G!). Ryan wooed us with a winning smile as he bent over backward to please. When I wasn't watching the locals, I was certainly enjoying watching the servers as they worked! As for the food and libations, you are in for a treat.Peruse the lovely winter cocktail menu, and just try to decide on one of them. If you must limit yourself, I recommend the Blood Orange Jalapeno Margarita. Your tongue will come alive with this fruity, salty, spicy little number. Not too sweet, just delicious. But, if you're into sweet, there are many creative cocktails from which to choose. As their webpage brags, a ""fantastic top-shelf bar"" is on display, and a diverse beer list finishes The Local - Chicago's impressive drink menu.We started with a salad. The Burrata and Vine-Ripened Tomato with basil oil and 12-year old balsamic vinegar was pretty, fresh and interesting. And, just to make our mouths water, Ryan expertly divided it onto two plates, intriguing us with an unintentionally sensual, artistic movement of serving spoons and plates. I gorged myself on appetizers and side dishes, all as delectable as described. The luscious lobster quesadilla melted in my mouth. Even the potato chips delighted me! Smothered in blue cheese, these crunchy, salty chips topped with truffle oil and cracked pepper made me swoon with pleasure. We also ordered and enjoyed the Pan Roasted Shiitake and Crimini Mushrooms (expertly prepared and oh so yummy) and finished with an incredibly decadent Oreo Mint Ice Cream Pie.Yes, I'm going back. I want to be a regular. And I'll probably gain a few pounds but, boy oh boy, will it be worth it."
"The food was very good, the waiter (Jake from Kalamazoo) was truly wonderful. There are two booths in the bar, don't sit there. Their high seats but with no foot rests, seriously painful after a few minutes. So get a table in Jakes section and enjoy the food & experience."
"This tasty treasure is across the street from my hotel. From the person who answered the phone to the precious young woman who delivered my meal to my room, the experience was terrific. The caesar salad was cold and fresh and the lobster macaroni and cheese was hot and cheesy. YUM! From the time I placed the order to the delivery, it took 18 minutes. Attention guests of The Rafaello: Call them!!!!!!!"
"We stopped by the Local for brunch recently and found it to be OK. Obviously convenient to the Hancock building and even not too far from Michigan Ave., it is a pleasant enough place. Very patriotic themed. Our friends that were from the area informed us that this restaurant has been several other things before and I kind of felt like the current patriotic theme definitely was not the original concept for the space.At any rate, the restaurant itself was fairly well-operated. Tables were set nicely, hostess greeted us promptly and asked us whether we preferred indoor seating or a place on the lovely covered patio. I felt that the menu situation was a bit confusing -- there was both a lunch and breakfast menu but instead of giving you both you were asked which one you wanted. I kind of wanted to see both but had to say so. The breakfast menu mentioned a brunch buffet, which I would have entertained, but I did not see a physical buffet set up and our waiter did not mention one. It might be helpful to put the buffet hours on the menu so it's clear.Speaking of our waiter, not so great but not awful. I had to ask someone else for a coffee refill, and he was not really super attentive even though there weren't that many tables at the time. He also did not tell us the specials but we spotted them on a board. I ordered the classic Eggs Benedict, which was decent but the eggs were overcooked (barely any runny egg, mostly cooked through) and very little Hollandaise sauce. My husband ordered the special, chicken and waffles, which he said were fine. But no one told us the price and it wasn't listed on the specials board. We were a bit surprised when we got the check to see that his meal was $22. A bit steep for chicken and waffles if you ask me. So in all, we had a passable brunch for an inflated price that topped $50. Not sure we'd go back. But on the plus side, we did discover that the place is open till 2 a.m. if you are after a late bite."
"Wonderful spot!!!  We were so happy to find that there was a place open late in our hotel.  Food was AMAZING!!!   My boyfriend and I both got the pot pies.  However, PLEASE remove the frightening clown statue that looks like he's about to get a facial at the bar!!!!  Furthermore, being in the industry myself, I do NOT understand the ridiculous outfits worn by the staff.  Please know the value of these wonderful individuals and don't parade them around like random 17 year olds that work at Friday's. ""Drop mic!"""
"This restaurant is usually delicious. Breakfast is a must. The wait staff is always cheery and willing to make your experience enjoyable.However, don't order breakfast once they open lunch. The food greatly decreases in quality. I would recommend this restaurant to a friend."
"This restaurant was the pleasant surprise of our latest weekend in Chicago. After failing to find a table near Lincoln Park Zoo, we headed back to the city and stumbled on this restaurant. This place turned out to be just what we were looking for! Upscale, but not too fancy, with great all-American local dishes, good bar selection and very good service. I think the restaurant really is some sort of a nice mix of vintage Americana with a modern twist, which can be seen both in the dishes and the decor. My wife had the special fish dish for the evening, a wonderfully cooked mahi-mahi, and I had one of my favorite dishes - chicken pot pie. Both were delicious, and so was our Oreo dessert.Bottom line - nothing outstanding here, just a really solid choice for a very good American dining experience."
"Full disclosure--even after being told that The Local comes from the makers of Chicago Cut Steakhouse (I'm a fan), I still decided to order the fish and chips because I had a burger for lunch yesterday.  This was a mistake; the beer-battered fish (cod is what we were told) was just okay, and it was TINY, like shamefully tiny portions.  The bed of fries helped, but I was essentially starving when the meal was done.  If you are even reasonably hungry and a bigger person, avoid the fish and chips at all costs.What was incredible was dessert.  I tried the Oreo mint cookie pie item; incredible.  The cookie was perfect, just the right amount of ice cream, the dish stood on its own and the chocolate sauce drizzled on the dish worked well.Prices are another knock here...but you can't complain about a place's prices if it's in ""The Gold Coast"", right?  (You might say this is Streeterville...maybe.  This is Gold Coast to me.)  But $16-$30 for these entrees doesn't quite fit.Our server was borderline too attentive--she came by three times in the first ten minutes after we had been seated with our menus essentially turned over (i.e. not reviewed) and by the third, we just felt bad so we ordered.  I don't even blame The Local for this; I'm confident that this is driven more by the clientele than management.  But hey--I'll order in a few minutes!  Let me catch up with my friend first, jeez!Big thumbs-up to our hostess, who seated us at a four top to accommodate my five-month-old and a stroller."
"We had Christmas breakfast at the Local.  I had an egg white omelet with spinach and mushrooms and my husband had corned beef.  Both were served with potatoes and toast.  The food was good, as expected.  We loved the very patriotic theme of this place.  The details on every furniture, dish and decor are very quaint and chic.  The service is very good.  Just about every staff but the chef came over to our table to ask how everything is.  Our server was very professional and thanked us for choosing to spend our Christmas morning with them.  I appreciated that gesture so much."
"I had the Dr. PEPPER RIBS and cornbread.  Using soda for ribs sounds crazy but it was actually very good. They even did well in the reheated leftover test.  The cornbread comes in a small cast-iron skillet like Granny made when you were a kid. I recommend it as well. This place is a bit pricey for a hotel restaurant.  With a coke, my meal was $38."
We live in the neighborhood and have enjoyed eating at The Local often since it opened both for lunch and dinner and have recommended it to friends. We also have ordered carry-out hamburgers on a regular basis. The last three times we have ordered the burgers we have been extremely disappointed. The first time both the burger and the fries were overcooked. The second time the burger was cooked properly but the fries were a soggy mess. When we called for the third order we specifically asked that the fries and burger be cooked properly. Apparently the chef didn't get the message. Burger overdone and fries limp and greasy. I regret having to leave such a public message about a restaurant we have liked in the past but to my knowledge there is nowhere on their website for feedback. We regret having to cross The Local off our local favorites.
"We decided to go to The Local because we wanted a place where we could catch up in peace and not be surround by 100000 tourist (sorry Cheesecake Factory). I must say that I will definitely be going back and I will recommend this establishment to all my friends! This place is good for a date or for a party of 4 - 6 people.Service:* If you can, try to sit in Jason's section. He is by far the best waiter I have ever come in contact with during my 6 years of dining out in Chicago.Appetizers: * Blue Cheese Fondue Chips -- Topped with truffle oil and cracked pepper ( I recommend you get this with bacon on top). I wasn't a huge fan of this dish, but the bacon kept me going back for me. * Jalapeño Cornbread -- Maple pecan butter was so good. I recommend that you get this dish. It's perfect to share with one other person; that way you both get two pieces.Entrées:* USDA Prime Meatloaf -- Mashed potatoes, apple-tomato jam, wild mushroom jus was delicious. The meatloaf was tender and the mashes potatoes were fluffy and creamy. I could have done without the apple-tomato jam, but it's on the side so if you don't like it just don't eat it.* Buttermilk Fried Chicken and Waffles was the dish my dining companion ordered and she loved it. This was her first time ever having chicken and waffles (I know I was shocked as well and appalled as well) and she is now a HUGE fan. With every bite her smile got bigger and bigger. The fact that she wasn't willing to let me try it speaks volumes for her good this dish was.Dessert:* Fresh Baked Chocolate Chip Cookies, these cookies kept me from giving The Local 5 stars. Our cookies were a little burnt on the bottom and I still can't figure out why they served them to us. However, our waiter Jason did get us a new batch of cookies that weren't the color of tar on the bottom."
"We were in town for the evening, and stayed around the corner from The Local. Had done the usual scan here for local places for dinner, then ended up walking around. Stumbled into The Local, and it was perfect for what we wanted.  Casual, but table clothes. Not too high brow, etc. We opted for the bar area. Our waiter came over, and Shawn was great. He recommended things on the menu, and we started with the -  Blue Cheese Fondue Chips -- Topped with truffle oil and cracked pepper. OMG! These were fantastic - albeit quite rich! The flavors were amazing! As a result, we changed course on the entrees. We went with the - Cobb Salad (split) - this was made with warm chicken and was one of the best Cobbs I have ever had! So good!- Rotisserie Chicken - we shared. It was cooked perfectly! But was a lot of food in the end! The wine list is served on an iPad, with a cool user interface and ways to find the wine you want. The selection is excellent. Too, you can narrow the choices by style/price as well. We had a lot of fun talking to the waiter, his back up help Kenny, etc. So they asked us about what we preferred (and could see a desert coming our way).  They brought out his skillet with a chocolate chip cookie base, with salted caramel ice cream, chocolate sauce and whipped cream ... amazing ... but pushed us over the edge! (back to the hotel room to lay down!)"
Tried the egg Benedict the first time and the eggs and corn-beef hash the second time.  Perfectly poached eggs both times.  My friends enjoyed their egg white omelette with plentiful spinach & sautéed mushroom and loaded oatmeal.  Smooth coffee.  Excellent service.  Classy joint.  Worth paying a little more for great food and surroundings.
"Yelpers got it right on this one again...so I am adding my positive review of this place to the list.The Local Chicago is my new favorite place for those go to comfort food dishes. The portions here are HUGE! Two people could share an entree - seriously.Chad was our server and he was great - super nice, attentive, but not hovering. If you know what I mean. He delivers a whole extra star rating to this place. Food and cocktails - a solid 4 star. Add in Chad and you get a solid 5 star experience.We tried their special chicken & waffles and the fish & chips. The chicken was super juicy and full of flavor - the waffle was good too. The fish & chips were also a big hit - just too my chips...so much food!They are open late, which I love.Enjoy!"
"Well, for the price this was a disappointment. The meal started with the waiter asking us if we wanted to see a wine Los, we said no and he left it at that. No mention of a drink list or if we wanted anything other than water. No problem, we were ok with water. Now for ordering, didn't ask if we wanted an appetizer , just took the full order. Didn't tell us about any specials so when we noticed the specials on a a board across the restaurant from our table one of our party wanted to change. Change accepted. As for the food, one of us had the lobster roll, ok but expected something much more flavorable. Fries were soggy. I had the fish and chips, good but both fish and chips were soggy, not crisp. The special was chicken and waffles, good, but chicken was dry. Seemed like all meals were prepared before we ordered. Cost was way to high for the quality. Also, what Yelp showed for menu was not what they had, so another disappointment."
"Food here is excellent..a very very pleasant surprise! The amount of reviews on this place and the small menu had me unsure about whether I wanted to try this place or not but so glad I did!DIshes:Pan-Roasted Scottish Salmon (Red quinoa, sautéed spinach,whole grained mustard sauce)- I licked this plate clean even though I was so full. Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and Grits- tasted my friend's dish and I will come back to order this as well. Perfectly seasoned and grits were amazing.I'm hoping I can try other dishes here in the future..i will definitely be back!FYI: restaurant is attached to a hotel so bathroom is a far walk towards the hotel then down the stairs. Clean bathrooms though!"
Great place open till 2 am last order till 1:15 am. I ordered for jalapeño corn bread after reading reviews in yelp. But wasn't a fan of it. Chicken pot pie was yummy. Roast chicken is good too. Excellent service.
"At least 8 items on the menu immediately appealed to me. The fish stew dish that I selected for dinner was delicious. Ryan, the manager, is hands-on and attentive to your satisfaction. Will, the waiter, is terrific. I will definitely dine here again."
"While I was unimpressed by the creativity of the menu, the execution was what counted.  My wife and I went here for lunch and she ordered the Shrimp Scampi which was kind of pricey and I ordered the Roasted Beet salad with Apples, blue chees and walnuts. We also ordered the Jalapeño Corn bread since everyone on Yelp was raving about it. Everything was perfect and the service was extraordinary. Great place."
Expect large portions! Every dish is great for sharing. Here are the two dishes I recommend:jalapeño corn breadamazing and fluffy. Best part? It was only $5. prime rib Largest I have ever had. Really worth the $29. The waiter even mentioned he has only seen a few people finish it.
"Stayed at the attached Hilton and ate here for breakfast. It was your typical over-priced restaurant attached to a hotel. Nothing special. Service was excellent, though."
Excellent service and attentive and helpful staff. Ordered what was recommended and they turned out great: goat cheese and steak. They have good selections of draft beer too.
"Waddled in here for lunch after our h-marathon literally couldn't move and we were greeted with smiles and such warm hospitality from the staff. We ordered fried goat cheese balls, fries, Mac and cheese, a chicken pot pie, a turkey sandwich, and a chicken noodle soup. We devoured it all!! It was all delicious and the service staff was so genuine. We we be back the next time we are staying at the Hilton. Thank you guys!!"
Ordered steak and pouched eggs. Man the steak was small. A tad salty. Wouldn't order it again but hash browns were great
Always great service and food. One of the few restaurants open until 2 AM.
"I am one of the regular customers at the Local.  I keep bringing people there because the experience is so good.  This time I will comment on the ambiance.  I brought two people together who didn't know each other so conversation was crucial.  The restaurant was quiet enough so that we could hear each other, and no one bothered us though we stayed for three hours to get some business done.  Not usual in today's restaurant world.  Thanks, Local."
"Fantastic option for anyone dining with food allergies! We went in for brunch with is incredibly difficult when you are allergic to eggs. They made a special, plain grilled piece of chicken and altered their fruit bowl so everything was low fodmap. They had their kitchen staff change their gloves and cooking utensils to make sure there wasn't any cross contamination.  A must for people with food allergies!!"
A good lunch spot with a tasty turkey burger.  Less pricy than the hotel bars & dining rooms close by.  Sunny tables for a sweet place to meet close to Mag Mile.
"The best old fashion hands down... My Pimms cups was so refreshing... And the Ahi Burger was so flavorful bite after bite. The wasabi sauce was on point! Great service by the entire team... You can see Leadership embedded in the team. Kendall, Joe, Norma thank you for the excellent service this weekend!!"
$$ is misleading. Ticket was $70 for two adults and one kid. Should be $$$. Good service and food though.
"My family had a great experience at The Local Chicago. The food was very good, of course, but we were especially impressed with the service. Our waiter, Sean, was amazing and the management also went above and beyond to make our meal memorable."
"Really enjoy how this place is open late at night.They have different specials on different days, I wanted to try the chicken and waffles but that was on Sunday!The portions here are huge! An entree is definitely shareable!For appetizer got the jalapeño corn bread ($5) and it was delicious!For the entree ordered the prime rib ($29) and it was huge!!! I would definitely recommend sharing this and an appetizer definitely can't finish this unless you are super hungry. It was also very juicy and good!Didn't know how big the the prime rib was so I ordered the rotisserie chicken with kale ($19). Came with 3 pieces of chicken and sautéed kale, the plate was large as well! I really enjoyed the kale and chicken, but after a while the chicken started to get a little bland, needed some mash potatoes and gravy to eat it with.For dessert ordered the apple Brown Betty, I thought it was okay, you may want to skip this, the apple started to get a little bland after a few bites, they needed to put ice cream over the pie!Overall dinner was great, definitely recommend the corn bread and prime rib!!"
"Good service. But way overpriced. For lunch we split a sandwich & the kids had a grilled cheese and dry cereal. ($7 for a lil box of frosted flakes ). Our lunch after 4 small glasses of draft beer was $88.00 before tip. Food wasn't bad, but really small portions (esp for the price). Not worth going back."
"Research tells us it takes 12 other impressions to overcome a bad first impression, but this is probably because no one is going to systematically count the number of impressions someone or something imprints upon them. A less than stellar first date is certainly not going to get 12 more after the fact, much in the same way the HR vice president at my old job had long ago written me off well before we had the chance to speak 12 more times. I bring up this long-winded detour into nothing because my first impression of The Local was one of apprehensiveness: the corner it was occupying looked like a war zone. Construction equipment littered the street. Bulldozers were lifting sections of concrete high into the air so that we may walk underneath risking being flattened like Wile E. Coyote if a slab of cement should fall. If I had stuck around, I'm pretty sure a local reporter wanted to interview me for a comment about ""what it all means."" Fortunately, it took all of 0 seconds for The Local to override this impression and the results, not to mention the food and service, were stellar.We had decided to walk down here one Saturday morning to try out their breakfast/brunch offerings, and so we began the (relatively) early morning trek. By the time you read this, the construction outside will probably have passed and the covered patio will be in full operation. As it was, there were maybe two tables sat and I don't know why: I could not hear myself think while walking up so I'm sure those meals must have been very peaceful and serene.When we walked in, a hostess greeted us and guided us to a table near the windows back and to the left of the hostess stand and the bar that stretched into a vanishing point I could not immediately discern. The hostess was attentive and friendly, just like everyone else milling about. Our server, Norma, was a joy to sit with: quick with the service and even quicker with the coffee refills. Not once were we lacking in anything, and it was a testament to the overall quality of the staff, be it the busser who cleared our table or the manager who came by for a brief chat to make sure everything was groovy.I'm afraid this review is going to be rather boring, hence the unnecessarily long scene setting of the previous paragraphs. We all three got the ""American Breakfast,"" which is your standard eggs, potatoes, toast, meat, etc. And despite being done three different ways at our one table, each concoction was as delectable as the last. The seven-grain toast was a particular highlight in that it sounded healthy -AND- tasted good.The decor is like a weird combination of Norman Rockwell and Cracker Barrel. Think vintage tin signs, Americana iconography and lots of red, white and blue. And that's all good but sweet leaping porcupines, there is a nightmare incarnate in the bar in the form of some clown tap dispenser... thing. It's hard to explain but you'll know it when you see it, for you will immediately forget what laughter was as you drown in your tears. There's also this electricity creature built out of lightning bolts that you've seen before on the way out of the far right side of the place painted on the wall, which I'm sure doubles as a great photo op depending on how inebriated one can be.Speaking of vacating the premises, the bathroom, from what I could tell, is accessed in the attached hotel lobby via a stairway near the front desk. It's a bit of a hike depending on where you are in the dining room, which probably means there was another bathroom I was unaware of and you should ignore this and the previous sentence.All in all, The Local is a fantastic dining option for your early morning needs. I'm sure this place has frequent business throughout the day, and it is not hard to see why: the staff are a joy to interact with, the menu is superb and the decorations scattered about range from comforting to scream-inducing. What's not to love?"
"My 3 friends and I were in town for a Girls Weekend trip; landed, dropped our bags and headed here for a drink and snack. We sat at the bar and the bartender couldn't have been cooler. We loved her; we asked her suggestions on beverages and food and all of them were spot on: she suggested bacon on the BC Chips and of course, that does make everything better. She also suggested the Blood Orange Jalapeno beverage and she was right about that too. We got the Mussels and those were good too. The next time I'm back in town and around this area, I will definitely return; great service, personality, food and beverage."
"Given that The Local is, in fact, quite local to my new apartment (and I've walked past it quite a few times) I decided to try it out the other night.First impressions were fantastic! Very cute patio. We didn't get to sit outside because it was packed, but the inside was very pleasant as well. It's somewhat of a USA theme, and how can you argue with that? My friends and I really enjoyed our food and were impressed by the extensive drink menu. They even hand you and iPad to peruse the different beers, wines, and cocktails. I ordered a summery cocktail (the name is escaping me right now) but it was delicious. My French dip sandwich was also really yummy. The only reason I did not give The Local five stars is that, obviously due to it's location, it was pricier than it needed to be!I would go back for sure."
"The service is always excellent! Not the best restaurant in the city, but the food is always pretty good! The mashed potatoes are amazing and the burrata and tomato salad is delicious, but seasonal, so get it when it's there!My husband and I have dined here a couple of times before, so we brought my in laws here for dinner on Saturday, and unfortunately I had problems with my entree. I ordered the filet well done. When it came out it was bright pink and bloody when I cut into it. It is not my norm to say anything, but my mother in law just mentioned it to the waiter (Tony) who apologized and took it back to the kitchen. When it came back out it was on a new plate and basically charred completely on the outside, but when I cut into it, it was still bright pink. I ate a little more, but it was just to undercooked for my taste. Our waiter and a manager asked if I wanted it to be taken back to the kitchen again, but at that point I wasn't even hungry anymore. They apologized and took it off the bill and brought us some fresh baked cookies in a to go bag! Unnecessary but it did turn a not so pleasant experience into a good one! Like I said, they have good service and because of that we will definitely go back!"
"While our server(s) get 5-stars for effort the food was good, but not exactly what i'd call memorable (except for this very second, obviously).  We had the winter vegetable tater tots, chicken/biscuit sandwich, and the meatloaf.  Granted these aren't exactly 'outside the box' selections, but if your gonna charge $22 for meatloaf, it better be DAMN good, and I'd give it a strong C.  The clincher is the menu is in stark contrast to the name...nothing in here (save the pork belly sliders?) was ""local to Chicago"".  At least have a bratwurst or something..."
"Had a great meal and great service by sean.  It was late after a long day of travel.  We had the truffled devil eggs, beet salad, lobster roll, and fried goat cheeses. All excellent food and great guidance by sean on what to order."
"Environment: 5/5Employees: 4/5Food: 3/5Costs: 5/5Accessibility: 1/5Total: 18/25Synposis:  When you first enter this restaurant, it seems like a circus with a little ferris wheel and American decorations.  As a minority, you instantly feel out of place, perhaps because all the waiters are white and the Mexcians, Centeral Americans, and Latinos are the bussers.  I simply come here with my boyfriend because it is convenient from his apartment right down the road and winter has deterred us from going to better places like Meli's, Stacks, or Eggsperience.  The people are generally pleasant and the food is mediocre at best.  I just come here for the Eggs Benedict because the cost decent for the food you get.Environment: Quite theatrical when you first enter with all these gadgets, but before sitting down it offers a very high-end feeling.  Am I in the right place?  Bougie for sure, but this part makes you feel nice.Employees:  The people are very nice and during my last visit the lady smiled and said, ""Thank you"" when I left.Food: Eggs Benedict seemed to be the best thing on the menu.  I tried ordering the crab one, but it wasn't that good.  Costs:  It was $11 for the Eggs Benedict.  Not too shabby for the area that the restaurant is located.  Accessibility:  For me, it is easily accessible.  However, if you are coming to this restaurant it is quite a walk from the red line.  Furthermore, parking is even more limited."
"The food is exceptional !  The service is attentive, and very informative.  The overall experience was so good the first time, we had to come back and make sure it's worthy of a review, and let me tell ya, it surely is!!! Highly recommend!!"
"If you want to pay through the nose for overpriced wine, mediocre food, and terrible service, this place is for you.I went there last night for the first (and last) time with colleagues after a monthly business meeting. There were 14 of us in the party, seated at a long table and served by two incompetent young male waiters who seemed to be vying for the title of Who Cares the Least.When a friend across the table asked her waiter about the house Merlot (the least expensive glass on the list at $9), he told her that he personally would never pay $9 for a glass of that particular wine because ""It tastes like a gym bag."" And of course, he recommended something over 50% more expensive.My waiter seemed miffed when I asked to see a wine list, because their wine list is not printed on a piece of paper; it's on an iPad -- and there were already two iPads at the table (of 14 people). Unfortunately, the people who had them at the time had not yet been waited on and wanted to keep them handy until they were (a reasonable request). So my waiter got me another iPad and let me know through his body language how much he had been inconvenienced for having to do so.When he came back a couple of minutes later, I was still looking over the rather extensive list of overpriced wine, so rather than moving on and taking the order of the person next to me, he left the table completely. And when he returned a couple of minutes later and found that I still wasn't ready, he left the table again, apparently unable to grasp the concept of continuing to take orders and coming back to pick up the ones he'd missed -- which is pretty basic table-waiting stuff.When the wine I ordered did arrive, it was a very small pour and served in the generic table wine glass rather than a proper glass for a red wine -- which I don't care at all about unless the restaurant is charging astronomical prices, which this one does.My wife is a vegetarian, and there's not much on the menu to accommodate her, so she ordered a baked potato and some sautéed spinach. When she asked her waiter about the size of the potato, since it was going to have to serve as her entrée, he shrugged and said, ""About regular size,"" dismissing the question completely. And when I asked him if it was organic, he shrugged again and said, ""I have no idea,"" making sure I knew that he didn't care. And when I pointed out that potatoes are perhaps the most important vegetable to make sure you get organic, his attitude was, ""Whatever.""The potato, when served, was of decent size, but the spinach was gritty, having not been properly cleaned.The USDA Prime Meatloaf that I ordered was unspectacular and dry. The ""wild mushroom jus"" that the menu promises was pretty much non-existent, and the meatloaf was served with a swipe of what tasted like barbecue sauce, which might constitute their version of ""tomato jam."" The seafood in the seafood bisque was minced beyond recognition, and its most hearty feature was a few halved cherry tomatoes, which gave it an odd taste.I was told by others at the table that the fish and chips were tasteless, and I observed that the lobster salad was miniscule. Only the turkey sandwich seemed to be of decent size.Fast forward to check-getting time...The waiters produced separate checks for everyone in the party; I'll give them props for that. But when a friend sitting next to me (who had ordered only drinks) handed our waiter a $20 bill and the receipt for $14, expecting change and the return of the receipt for his business expensing, he waited in vain for the return of both. And when he finally pointed out to the waiter (after most of the others in our party had left) that he was still waiting for his change and the receipt, the waiter told him that he had already closed out the bill for the table, so he didn't have the receipt anymore. He then asked my friend for an approximation of how much his bill had been and then brought back $6 and had to work through their payment system to try to produce a receipt... all because he had assumed that my friend was giving him a $6 tip on a $14 bill... for bad service.So if you're in the neighborhood and tempted to go into The Local Chicago for a bite, do yourself a favor -- hail a cab and ask the driver to take you to Bandera or Grand Lux. You'll get more and better food and wine, superior service... and even when you include cab fare, you're likely to end up with a lower total bill."
"A very welcoming arrival kicked off the experience as we were escorted to the outdoor seating. The area is separated by planters that ate visibly pleasing and help create space between the tables. Most of the pricing tanned between fourteen and thirty four main entrées. After reading other reviews, my wife and I decided to split the TLC burger, fresh cut fries fries, and the mac'n cheese. The burger was delicious and cooked to the correct temperature. The mac'n cheese was also very good. I would say that it is enough for three to four people to split as a side.  The fries were also rather good.Service was very nice and attentive.I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a nice meal within this price range."
Breakfast was amazing and service is excellent.  I recommend the Benedict and the smoked salmon on a bagel.
Average quality at high prices. This is basically the hotel breakfast restaurant which is ordinarily included in any chain hotel's rate.
"Went here for lunch on Monday - the place was really cool and I'd likely return for drinks, but the vegetarian food selection was limited. We had the mac n cheese but the first time they forgot to remove the bacon, after we reminded them twice. The sides of grits and mushrooms were okay. The burrata-tomato salad was my favorite. Service was slow, confused and just okay."
"I choose this place because I was staying at the Westin and it was nearby. I saw the pictures on yelp and thought I should give it a try. Great food, great service, good price.I liked how the plates matched the  name of the restraunt"
"We really enjoyed the Local Chicago. Our server was very professional and put us at ease. Now the food is kinda pricey, but the quality and quantity of the food is great. Their burger was really freaking amazing and the chicken pot pie was delicious and filing. I would definitely recommend this spot if you are thinking about this place."
Excellent service but mediocre food. I tried a little bit of everyone's food but everything was just meh.
"Just got back from an 11:00 am breakfast (because they don't serve lunch until 12:00 and they don't have a brunch menu). I'll start with the food. Portions are pretty small. The omelette looked like it was made from an egg mixture and not fresh eggs, because the color was too smooth. It wasn't a real omelette, but rather a flattened fried egg that was just folded over some ingredients that weren't really complementing each other.The breakfast tacos were ok and so was the ham sandwich, both 3 stars. The breakfast potatoes that came with all the food had a rather commercial taste. It took the kitchen 25 minutes to get the food ready. Way too long for what we ordered and the quality of the food. The toast that came with the food was very dry.The food is extremely overpriced. Ended up paying $46 for the aforementioned food. Ridiculous.The service was ok. Never a real interest in the customer. The routine ""how is everything"" question was very uninterested and the waitress didn't really care what the answer was. And never a smile. I had to wait 3 minutes to get her attention to request the check because she was chatting with someone (not another customer of course).This is basically a tourist trap... Being a local, I would never eat there again.Disappointing. I was hoping this is a place worth going to based in the other yelp reviews."
Great restaurant.  The host was nice and even give me ideals on what to order. I'm from NY and I come to Chicago at least 1 weekend a month and I have to stop here. Andrew Arellano was exelente.  Must try the quesadilla.
By far our best meal in Chicago!  My hubby and I went here based on Yelp reviews and because it was right around the corner from our hotel.  We were treated like royalty and the food was superb!  Our waiter was Joseph and he suggested the skirt steak and the special of the night... Pork shoulder wrapped in bacon. We got both and shared. Oh my goodness. That skirt steak was to die for!!  The pork was delicious as well. Both were so tender. Yum!  The manager came to our table to check on us and gave us his card... Then we were told our hotel... The Drake had called and said to give us a complimentary dessert. We chose chocolate mousse and it was to die for. The ambiance is great!  The food is superb and the service is top notch!  Try it!!!!
"I had breakfast here a couple times during my stay and it was a-ok.  Service was friendly and attentive.  They have a breakfast buffet which looked good, however, I did not try it.  I ordered the yogurt and granola with fruit instead - now being from California I am used to getting the freshest fruit, so I was slightly disappointed when the fruit was actually dried fruit.  The yogurt and granola were good but I would have preferred fresh fruit.  I had the corned beef hash another morning for breakfast and it was a-ok too, not espcially tasty but ok.  This place was quite busy for dinner though.  I noticed they serve Frank Family wines which I would highly recommend with your meal."
"Great food and excellent service.  If you want some of the best comfort food you've ever had, give this place a try!  My meatloaf was great and I would order it again."
"Horrible food that costs an arm and a leg and bad service. 2 eggs for $6, lol. I asked if they could give me something else instead of sausages, the rude waitress said you can't substitute sausages for anything."
We went for Christmas lunch. The service was at par and food was delicious. I asked to share a chicken pot pie between 2 and they actually got us 2 portions of the pie and I must say it was the best one I had. My friend ordered fires and Amish chicken which was good too.
"This place was good, we didn't have a reservation but they worked to seat us fast anyway. I wanted the shrimp and grits, but they wrapped the shrimp in bacon and it was already premade so that made me sad. I settled instead for the meatloaf which was ok, but with the apple jam that came with it it was pretty good. My husband had the prime rib which was good. Their lemonade was super good too. The only thing is Yelp had at $$ and I think it should be $$$. It was also not as casual as I thought."
"We had just left Water Tower Place and saw the review for The Local Chicago.Wait time: None (late lunch at 1:30)Ambience:All 'Merican! Very homey with Red, White, and Blue as well as country charm.Service:Our waitress was 'sweet as pie.'Food:Jalapeño Cornbread- very tasty! A mix of sweet and spice. A little much to share between the two of us (better for 3-4 people)Macaroni Carbonara- very good! Creamy with cavatappi pasta and thick pork belly bits and peas. Yummy!Sliders- also very good. 3 sliders were a perfect lunch size for the two of us (1 person if sharing a single side).Complaint- the diet coke was served in adorable 8 oz glass bottles... Less adorable when you find each bottles costs $3. My only issue (and reason for 4 stars) was the price."
Amazing service!  There are great restaurants all over Chicago but non compare to The Local. Great food and amazing service.
"This is better than 4 stars, but I can't quite bring myself to award it the coveted 5 stars because i didn't have a full meal there and I did not eat what I would consider their ""signature"" dishes.  I can say, however, that this place is a hidden gem.  There are a few really good restaurants in this area, east of Michigan and River North; the Local is like a more laid back Lux Bar, perhaps without the pomp and nausea of the Gold Coast crowd (it's only a few blocks away but attracts a different type).  It's a cozy spot, various menu options include both formal dinner and bar plates, and a fairly extensive wine menu (on an iPad).  The staff are friendly, and I gather the place is open pretty late too, which is good for that area since not many are.  Overall a great spot; I will return to eventually try those USDA prime sliders."
"Great food. Affordable. Awesome location and patio. Ask for Andrew, he was a pleasure. Helluva ""Old Fashioned,"" to boot..."
"Went to Local on Wendsday evening. This was my forth visit. The food was very goog and the service excellent. HOWEVER, this was my last visit. The restaurant  was 1/2 full and the noise level was awfull. Local is all hard surfaces and the place echos. There was one load table and the sound bonces off those surfaces."
"My parents were in town and we had just returned a rental at the Enterprise off State/ Chestnut.  I opened my Yelp app and searched for a brunch restaurant.The Local Chicago was among the first results.Having wanted to try this for a while, we walked toward streeterville.  What a pleasant surprise!  The wait staff was nice, the decor was pleasant, and the food was spectacular.We ordered a portobella steak burger, the $30 lobster salad, and a turkey club.  We shared all of the above among 3 people, and we were stuffed with leftovers.The steak burger was definitely the favorite of what was ordered: 3/4 lb ground steak patty, portabella mushroom cap, and gyurere cheese. Fries on the side.Heaven.PS: the only inconvenience is that their bathroom is in the basement of the connected hotel"
Great burger and other comfort foods.   Spectacular service
"Ate here today for lunch at the bar.  Bartender was inattentive and frankly, disgusting.  He made a ""special"" drink for a customer and after sneezing on his sleeve peoceeded to sniff the special cocktail, runny nose and all.  Turns out it was an experiment and she couldn't drink it.  Either that or she was offput by is unsanitary practices I ordred a salmon ruben that was okay, but I got the end of the fries and nothing but short pieces.  Not what I would expect for the dollars paid and the bartenders behavior and poor attention to guests... I would be back."
"The poor review is mainly due to the service. Our server was not friendly at all. All of their egg dishes had some sort of pork. One of the choices for breakfast was 2 eggs, bacon sausage, toast, hash browns for 14 bucks. We don't eat pork so we asked if they could substitute it for maybe a little smoked salmon or anything else because it would definitely not be worth it to spend $14 on 2 eggs. She said no because salmon is worth more than bacon and sausage. I get that...but then suggest something else then. She just stared at us blankly so we ended up going with the smoked salmon bagel instead. Also, there was a server going around offering coffee. My husband said yeah sure. We get the bill and 3.50 for a small cup of mediocre coffee. Very disappointed in the end. I would not recommend this place to anyone."
"This would be the second time I eat here and both times I wasn't disappointed. Great traditional fare, very tasty food and an excellent atmosphere!! Prices were reasonable considering the location... A real winner!"
My boyfriend and I stopped in here for a decent meal at 1:45am. We were not disappointed. You get an upscale atmosphere without losing the comfort of casual attire and friendly service. The lobster quesadilla was out of this world! I would come back just for that. The homemade guac that came with was great. I also had chicken noodle soup which was great as well. My boyfriend has fish and chips which were cooked perfectly and tasted very fresh. The complimentary mousse the server gave us sealed the deal on a perfect late night meal.
"BEST BURGER EVER! Thanks to the staff at The Millennium Knickerbocker for the recommendation. Visiting from San Diego, our last meal was an 11pm late dinner. What a great place. Great food. Great service. Try the hamburger, you won't be disappointed."
Large portions. Attentive staff. The skirt steak was delicious and enormous as was everything else.America!
"This is a go to place for comfort food!  The crab cakes and mac n cheese are amazing, as is the pork chop.The patio always seems to be over shaded, which is annoying when you want a little sunshine on a breezy day."
Turkey noodle soup was very good. I had the French dip which was also good. Lean beef and good hearty roll that didn't fall apart when you dip it in the au jus. Waitress was very friendly and provided great service.
Good food and easy to get toBobby the bartender went above and beyond. Extremely friendly and went out of her way to make a list of other places I should check out while I was there. Keep up the awesome work!
Good bar with an average menu. Limited craft beer selection but a super friendly and knowledgable staff. Had the tuna burger and it was good - not exceptional - but a fair value. I would come here again for a decent meal with nice staff. Eat at the bar!
"Great experience! Service started off slow, but the manager came and took care of us and it was fine (we came at a slow time)"
"My wife and I thought this restaurant had a lot to offer.  We started with shrimp chilli and blue cheese fondue chips   Both of them were good, but especially shrimp chili was great.  For entree my wife ordered a cobb salad.  They had usual chicken with chunk bacon and ground boiled egg, which provided very cushy texture.  I ordered ahi tuna burger.  I thought it would have been better if it were not the ground tuna pattie, but more of a sandwich type with intact ahi tuna.Overall it was a pretty good experience."
We went here for breakfast.  Our hotel offered one but this was right around the corner and we wanted to try something different.   I had the corned beef hash with poached eggs.  It was very good :)  My fiance had the surf and turf eggs benedict.  Very unique with the steak and crab toppings and it was good.  The steak was very tender.    Lump crab...well how can you go wrong? Prices were reasonable and the place was not busy when we were there (a little after 730 am).
"Based on other reviews, we shared a burger and the Mac and cheese and were not disappointed!  Great mix of meat for the burger with cute little sides for the toppings/coleslaw. .. And the Mac and cheese was faaaaaaaar far away from the blue and orange box kind. .. Perfect addition of peas and cut up bacon in the smokey white cheddar cheese! :)"
"Located just across from our lovely hotel was this great local bistro. It seems relatively new to the area.We sat outside on the patio and that was really terrific. The service was spot on and very professional.I had the porcini encrusted burger and Hubs had the TLC burger. Both were cooked at a perfect medium rare- which we could have since the  beef was from premium cuts of the cow, not just the unknown ground beef gray area. Delicious! Fries could have been crispier but we were there for an early lunch (11:30) so perhaps the fryer wasn't quite hot enough yet.I'd definitely return."
"Second visit. Service was sloppy. Waited 20 minutes to order and then she was very brusque. Food was good but atmosphere and service rushed and haphazard. In fairness it was a Sunday morning, but they should be prepared."
Totally starving after a night out I was recommended this place by a friend that now lives in the area.  I was amazed!  We sat right outside on the patio (which was a little bit crowded in terms of density of tables).  The service was superb but that wasn't the shining star for me.  The best part about this place is the price of the entrees and the size of the portions.  I ordered a burger and I can normally devour any size burger but I literally could only get half of this one down.  I can't remember exactly but that burger and fries was only like $10!  That's not something you'll find easily in Chicago.
"The food here was amazing, I was really surprised - I thought it would be okay, but was honestly pleased with everything that we ordered. The prime rib was fantastic, probably one of the best prime rib's I've ever had! We also ordered Fish and Chips, they were very good, and one order of BBQ Ribs which we also done perfectly.Service was outstanding, no complaints there at all. Everything was paced very good.I would receommend this place while in town, we were staying at the Hilton Mag Mile, got in late and The Local was very convienant because you can get into it from the hotel lobby.Desserts were tasty too if you have room after the dinner!"
"This was next door to our hotel, so I had to go back a few times to try all the great stuff on the menu!  Our first trip here I had the lobster quesadilla, which was smooth and buttery.  The salsa and guacamole were such a great addition to this delicious combination of ingredients. The next visit I tried a good ole traditional burger with home cut fries.  It was great paired with a local light beer on tap with the number 2 in the name.  The staff were also very friendly here!If I had time I also really wanted to try the sea scallops with butternut squash risotto!  It was pretty pricey for me and I only had a short window of time, but maybe you can try it."
"Value for $.  Quality ingredients.  Lots of specials -- on the board, on the menu.Sauteed Lake Perch -- Friday special.  Perch was lightly sauteed bathing in butter.  My first wild rice salad in Chicago with evenly sliced almonds and green grapes.  A healthy meal with contrasting texture.  Fresh nicely wrapped lemon with easy squeeze.  Not a fan of tartar sauce, but it tasted house made with predominant mayo taste.Oreo Mint Ice Cream Pie -- good recommendation from Matthew.  Serves 2.  House made whipped cream.  Oreo crumbs was fluffy!  Generous heap of the choco mint gelato from Chicago's own Black Dog.Coffee -- from Chicago's Metropolis.  Served warm that was quick to cool.Service -- Matthew was knowledgeable, attentive and memorized the ingredients without a menu.Atmosphere -- nicely spaced tables.  Spacious.  Relax.  I love the extended hours.  If you have a meeting, you can still achieve privacy.  Nice open windows for people watching.  Kitschy Americana decor that is an homage to the old pub.  See Justin (the GM) for a historial lesson.The Local sincerely epitomises the heart and soul of Chicago.  Bravo!I look forward to enjoying breakfast....bacon!"
"This place is awesome. I went there for lunch last week and had a Caesar salad, the Ahi Tuna burger and a side of cornbread. The caesar salad was pretty much what you would expect however the croutons they used seemed to be made out of their cornbread which, since the cornbread is probably the best I have ever had, put it over the top. The Ahi burger come with a sesame wasabi sauce that was just a little spicy but mild enough to not kill the taste of the rest sandwich or send you choking down water from too much heat. The service here was also top notch and the interior of the restaurant had a bit of a tavern feel to it. Along with some of the menu items you kinda got the feel that it was a upscale bar food type atmosphere."
"This place is where happiness and warmth and friendliness go to be tortured before committing suicide. EVERYBODY looked miserable. My waitress was miserable, the cooks looked like they wanted to escape back to Mexico. Another waiter was balding right before my eyes. It's a sterile and stern environment. You could probably have unprotected sex with a hundred men and never worry about pregnancy. A fetus could never survive the icy boredom. As an out of town visitor I knew I made a mistake shortly after sitting down.ok ok...That said, I ordered an over easy egg with hash browns. Perfect. Hash browns were fancy looking but tasted like fresh potatoes that never met a freezer. I asked for tobasco and the sad sad waitress brought me one of those teeny tiny novelty bottles that I had to gnaw the plastic off of.Green tea-small and I had to actually get up, track down my sad waitress and ask for something (anything) to sweeten it. Bacon wrapped shrimp and grits- Those are the biggest shrimps I EVA saw. bacon was perfect and crisp. Grits were...aiiiight. lumpy but flavorful-ish.But for 30 bucks I want grits that make me want to fucking sing damnit.Here's the thing, some places don't know who they are and just like when people don't know who they are it can be uncomfortable to be around. The decor and enviornment is pinky out, the service was Mcdonalds-ish and the food is southern meets fancy. If the lack of smiles and warmth doesn't rob you of your appetite the food is pretty good."
"The food is terrible. The atmosphere is cringe-worthy. The prices are of the ratio to reality one might find at an airport.I am sitting here now. The employees are very nice. But, still, $14 for a knob on the rocks when everyone around you is an ugly tourist? No. This place could not be less 'local'."
"We were going to another destination for dinner last week in the city and found out that had gone out of business.  We walked past the Local, I heard about it on the radio so my wife and I gave it a try.  Great decision on our part!  Our server, Joseph did an awesome job.  He recommended the jalapeno cornbread-PERFECT! and the guyrerecheeseburger-again to die for!  Managers came up to make sure everything was ok.  Definitely going to be going back."
"I was just here last Thursday Night. For some reason I was just coming from work and I looked like Columbo because I had a trench coat and a duffel bag with some stuff that was supposed to go to the cleaners...OY so back to the meal :)I put my stuff underneath the bar.I noticed there was a person who had a problem with the wine list being on an IPAD...Hey wake up it's 2013 Do you want to be displayed on Hierogliphics or something? maybe wave a light  if you want a white wine and wave the light 2 times if you want a red ...OK I'll stop giving that person a rough time :)I ordered the strip steak. WOW...they did a real good job. My understanding is that they marinade it in their own Teriyaki Sauce...Nice touch. Even though I was not spending $290 like at some other places, I noticed that some of the management came up to me and asked me how the meal was.This will quickly become a neighborhood favorite of mine.Try the Portugese Wine and the Reisling.Thanks for the awesome meal"
"This review is more of an FYI for those who have not been here.  My purpose for ordering from the Local Chicago was to get a quick meal after arriving into Chicago late.  After browsing through their menu online, I opted for the chicken drummette appetizer, a side of spinach, a side of asparagus, and a side of fries.  In my mind, a few chicken wings and 3 small sides were enough for a one person dinner.  I also placed the order to-go.  When I arrived, to my surprise, my bill was $44 plus! I come from a smaller city so I guess prices in the big city were much more.  When I looked at the bill, each side item was $10+.  Who would order $10 worth of fries or $12 worth of asparagus?!? Each side item was a meal in of itself!  In addition, the quality and flavor of the food was not there.  Since I did order my food to-go, I should have expected them to be soggy by the time I got to them (which was no more than 10 minutes since I am staying at the Hilton next door).  Nonetheless, I had a long day of travels, was tired, and just hoped for a good meal.  It was far from a good meal.  Again, FYI for those who have not been here, they do not list prices on their menu on the website.  Should have taken that as a sign but I was tired and hungry.  If you decide to pay them a visit, I hope your experience is much better.  I, on the other hand, will explore other options."
The Local has ok food and not so ok service. Highlights for the day I went (St Paddy's Day) was a corned beef hash with smoked bacon and eggs. Add poached eggs and u have an almost perfect brunch. Can't say enough of the decadent smoked bacon. Oh my. Come just for this!
Great food and great service!!!!   Cannot say enough about this place. The service is spot on and the food amazing. Only downside is finding the bathroom.
"The Local is the little sister of Chicago Cut.  It's located in the lobby of a Hilton Suites Hotel (and they serve breakfast, lunch, dinner) - just east of Michigan Avenue (behind the Westin and Hancock Bldg).  From the moment you approach the hostess stand, it's the same outstanding service as we've come to expect from CC.  Met 2 lady-friends for lunch on a beautiful Saturday afternoon.  We sat outside (it was delightful).  Our server, Andrew, was helpful, humorous and knew his stuff.  We each had a cocktail (they were generous).  The 2 lady-friends each had eggs benedict (and they were very pleased); I had the fish & chips -- and this was a delicious choice.  Too large for me to finish.  Checking out plates of other diners -- portions are extremely large and everyone looked happy.  Damien (a manager) also checked in with us to make sure we were happy (we were).  And when we mentioned we were ""Locals"" and not visitors, he gave us a bunch of added TLC.  We also mentioned the 3 of us are big fans and regulars at Chicago Cut.  I will go back -- especially when I have time to spend and don't have to be back at work in an hour.  If you're shopping on or around the Gold Coast -- The Local is a bit off the beaten path and definitely worth trying.   You know you can count on me because I am the Queen of Common Sense and I love good food."
"Newly opened in December 2012, it's nice to have in the neighborhood, but not a destination.They take no reservations on :15, only half hours.  ""Computer can't handle.""  Wine list - a computer tablet.  Fine if it works, but after being shown how to use it twice by the waiter, he took it back and brought back one already open to the page I wanted.  But then some Italian wines were on the Italian page, some were only on the by-the-glass page.  Apparently they use this system at their other restaurant, so no excuses for it being a new system.  Maybe they need a bit more sophisticated computer system, for the reservations and the wines.  Although that could be overlooked, if the food was worth the visit.  Not.The chicken legs appetizer had inappropriately spicy blue cheese dressing.  My burger came out burnt, not medium (""pink in the middle"") as I'd requested.  Fries were great.  To compensate for the burnt burger, we were told to ""save room for dessert, on the house.""  We never saw a dessert menu - they just brought an apple cobbler dessert with a scoop of ice cream on it and three spoons for us to share.  Big deal!Service was excellent, decor is nice.  Acoustics are excellent, given the crowded boisterous atmosphere.  But I see no food-related reason to go back."
"GOOD PRICES, GREAT SERVICE, BETTER FOOD!!Came here one night while staying at a hotel nearby, couldn't have been happier with our experience at this restaurant. Our waiter was extremely helpful and very knowledgeable about their menu. And I might add, very friendly. There were so many good choices on the menu, it was hard to pick. I do recommend, if you happen to be dining on a Thursday, to try their Thanksgiving special. Very, very good. The turkey was so moist and really fluffy mashed potatoes. The special was also served with a side of this tasty cornbread stuffing, really good.I will definitely eat at this place again next time I visit.P.S. The mint oreo pie is a must!!"
"This Americana restaurant was a great place for dinner. - Staff were so welcoming. Our server couldn't get to is quickly so a manager took over and everyone double checked to make sure the food was as we wanted it- The gruyere mushroom burger was fantastic, they replaced fries with coleslaw, no problem- The 9 iron blue cheese salad was great- Chocolate mousse was yummy- Ambiance was a little noisy for a white tablecloth restaurant- Were ready to ask about allergy issues and how they could accommodate - Did have cider on draft and three options Win!We had a great time and would def go back if we loved here. :)-"
We had a wonderful dinner last evening and would definitely dine again. The outdoor seating was quaint and comfortable and the food was wonderful!
"Ok, ""The Local"", you did it again!  My daughter and her husband lived in your neighborhood.  They were moving on her birthday.  My son in law came into Local requesting a dessert she loved, a gelato mint pie I believe.  The person who took my son in laws order as a carryout, graciously gave him the dessert without charging him.  The dessert was on him for her birthday.  I will sadly miss The Local!  I am happy they are moving closer to home but I will miss this accommodating and good food restaurant.  We will be sure to visit!  Good luck and thank you for such great service."
"Very rude bartender with an attitude. If you are staying at the hotel and want a drink, go somewhere else! Don't waste your time dealing with this lady that doesn't care about serving you."
"I forgot to post a review for this place for a while. My cousin and I were in Chicago for about three months for work and this was our regular hangout when we weren't working. The staff is really friendly and helpful, and the prices are very reasonable for the quality and the location of the place. The bartenders here make the absolute BEST Moscow mule I've ever had. (If you don't know what a Moscow mule is, go order one at a bar, it's the best). Anyway, whenever I am back in Chicago, I will absolutely be coming back to the Local."
"I came here with a few coworkers recently, as we were looking for a casual place in a decent price range - like a pub or American grill.Yelp has it with 2-dollar signs. It is for sure 3 - a burger and beer with tip will be $30 out the door. Upon walking in, we realized it isn't the most casual place. Linen tablecloths, black napkins substituted for white for those wearing dark colors, and an overall more-fancy-than-casual atmosphere in the dining room. Our first not-so-great-impression was the wine and beer list.  The waiter gave us an ipad with the list. The app absolutely was horrible. It was clunky to navigate back and forth, and didn't offer the ease of browsing a wine list. It had huge pictures and only showed a few per page, so took a while to get thru it.  The beer list was equally painful - I don't need to see a huge picture of an Amstel light bottle - just show me the damn list. We ordered tuna tartare and jalapeno cornbread to start.  The Tuna tartare was odd: it had macadamia nuts atop, and a lemon-mustard underneath and around it.  The tuna itself was kidna bland, just some salt would work wonders.  Neither the nuts and mustard belonged on the plate - none of us liked it.  The cornbread was good cornbread, but the jalapeno part of the title came in a butter, and was simply not spicy at all. Onto the main course.. I ordered the burger.  It came out sitting in a pool of its own grease. Possibly enough to drown a small duck.  The bun looked like it was run over with a truck repeatedly.  When my coworker, who never can keep her mouth shut, made a half-joke that ""my bun came from a week of being sat on"", the waiter shrugged and didn't ask if he could replace it.  I wasn't terribly hungry for the entirely greasy burger anyways, so the bun wasn't a huge concern.  Which was good - as it was pretty terrible, even soaked in beef grease. One coworkers entree was an uneventful steak salad that was covered in way too much dressing, and the other was a rotisserie chicken that was pretty darn good.  However, the grace of the good chicken can't save the odd/poor service, the crappy wine list (that we asked to replace with a paper list - that they didn't have), and the poor flavor combos of macadamia nuts on tuna..."
This was a small quaint restaurant at the hotel we were staying out.  I didn't want to go and walk around the city to find dinner so we tried this place out.  It was a great surprise!!!  The jalapeño bread appetizer was too die for with pecan butter.  The chicken pot pie was great and to top it off they had homemade chocolate chip cookies.   Oh my I am from the south so I love a good warm and goey cookie!!!  Would loves it so much we went back the next night.  Highly recommend this place as the staff were great.
"I found this restaurant to be quite average. I was disappointed to have wasted a meal while in Chicago at this restaurant. The food had good flavor but nothing special. My biggest disappointment was that my server was relatively new and not familiar with the menu, she seemed to have no enthusiasm for the offerings which was contagious."
"Outdoor patio is on one of the most gorgeous in the city providing a lush barrier between diners and street traffic. Service is on point, but not overly aggressive. Lobster salad, shrimp cabo chili, skillet cornbread are creative and flavorful. The recently added salmon burger special should be a permanent menu add. Love our 'local' place!"
Awesome food and service. Definitely recommend. Will come back next time we're in town!!
"Absolutely wonderful restaurant! Out of all the restaurants I have been to, this one has the best service. The staff there are incredibly friendly, and they don't mess up your orders, unlike how a lot of restaurants do, that's right I'm looking at you Panera Bread. The food there was absolutely scrumptious, and the location of it is wonderful, right next to the Hilton, and Raffaelo hotels. And also it's across the street from the John Hancock Center, and it's just a block away from Michigan Ave. and just a walk away from the lake front. So if you are looking for a place to eat in Chicago, GO TO LOCAL!!!"
"Glad to have this American comfort food restaurant in the neighborhood!! Went there for dinner today.  Service was very intensive & they brought out our food in great timing.  Love the appetizers & entrees.  They were delicious.  Just need a little improvements on the dessert. We started with Cabo shrimp chili & warm jalapeño corn bread (they serve it on a warm plate; very thoughtful).  My fiancé ordered the prime beef burger & fries.  I ordered the special of the day: rainbow trout.  For desserts, we had the Apple Brown Betty (They need to put more crumbles on the top & the apple slices were little sour),  it was still decent."
If there was a zero stars or negative this place would get it. We stayed at the Hilton Suites this weekend and on our final evening decided to have drinks at the restaurant. My brother had a renewal license as he'd just moved to Iowa and this place refused to serve him a drink when he presented 4 forms of ID. I understand the need to comply with local liquor laws and that's why it's not the decision to refuse him service that I write this review. The MANAGER WAS A COMPLETE JERK! He had absolutely no regard for our family and why a paper ID would be issued. He's a puppet just like the politicians of this city and cannot be entrusted with accountable service.
I was visiting Chicago for the first time. I walked in and right away Jacob made me feel right at home. He told me everything about the city and where to go. The food and the service was also excellent. Ask to sit in Jacob's section and you won't leave unsatisfied.
"First night in Chicago and this did not disappoint. C'mon, ""The Local""? Had to be decent. My pal and I split the special (Lobster Boil) as well as the 16 prime rib. So 'ono. Got a side of grits and sauteed mushrooms as well. Feast for royalty."
"I usually make this my last breakfast when visiting Chicago. It's a short walk from the hotel I stay at. Well, after today's performance, it truly will be my last breakfast there. We had an overpriced breakfast, which is understandable for the neighborhood, but what really made the experience so bad was our server. We generally are on a time schedule, and we asked our server for the bill, she said right away. Ten to fifteen minutes later, no check. No server,  who I found chatting it up with her colleagues while feeding her face. I was irate, her response was ""oh, I thought I had dropped it at your table"" obviously not, as she had to go to the point of sale register and get the bill. No apology, no nothing. I usually like to tip at least 20% if not more. I was going to leave her the change from $40.00 ( which was only a couple of dollars) but my conscience got the better of me, and added another 5.00. I spoke to the hostess/ manager who again made no apology...what a difference from a year ago when we were greeted warmly,  had excellent service and a charming conversation with our server. It really was a let down as it was our post wedding breakfast. Oh, and by the way the hair on the coffee saucer was not on our gift registry!"
"We went to The Local for brunch on a holiday Friday morning (4th of July). We sat on the patio, which was very pretty and nicely shaded. You can order off the menu or go for the buffet (inside the hotel). We ordered off the menu, and the food was delicious. However, it was not really anything special, and we could have gotten the same kind of food anywhere.And the service was very ""eh"" - missing some basics. We were seated and a waitress came by and got our drink order (she only asked about coffee or juice, rather that going for the usual brunch offerings of mimosas or a bloody mary), and then another waiter came by asking the same thing only 2 minutes later - I guess they don't have their sections organized? And maybe our waitress was new to the job, but just some little things were missing. Fortunately we had everything we needed when the food was brought out, because she did not come by and check on us. Then at the end of the meal, we sat with our dirty dishes in front of us for about 10 to 15 minutes. She did not clear the dishes even when we asked for the check, or when she brought the check to us. My husband and I both worked in the service industry for several years so our standards are a little high, but these are some basics that even chain restaurants and small diners typically take care of.The experience really was just average. Nothing terrible, but nothing spectacular. Also, the name of the restaurant is misleading - we were hoping for some more ""local"" Chicago-type things or specials that you can't get just anywhere."
Excellent upscale breakfast or lunch place. Much like Tavern on the park. Great service.
"My server, Andrew, was amazing!  He was friendly, attentive and offered great suggestions!  I highly recommend the Cabo Chili and Jalapeño Cornbread!  Delicious!"
"Had the skirt steak here, recommended by our server. It was awesome. Service from the entire staff was great. Good spot to visit in downtown."
"Of all the places we dined this week, The Local was by far the favorite of our family (2 adults, 2 teens). Reservations were made through OpenTable without a problem. When we were running late, the hostess was extremely gracious. Valet at the Hilton (in the same building) for $12. Not too shabby. The food was just what we were looking for and the service was phenomenal. Our server's name was Jason (though this is an issue of contention. Sorry, Pharm-student-waiter guy...if your name isn't Jason!) and he was AWESOME: friendly, knowledgeable, flexible. I like the pomp and circumstance of going out to dinner, though, so this was perfect for me. There are fewer things that annoy me than being hurried through a meal. I appreciate paying a little more for not feeling like they need to turn the table in under 45 minutes. Timing was perfect and who doesn't like it when someone else divides the apps? The stewards were also very polite and prompt. If you're in a hurry, have small children who might not sit for a longer dinner or are looking for hush-hush, The Local probably isn't for you. Lots of boisterous, celebrating, laughing folks. My style. In the details - Locally sourced, where available. Classic American. Great food. Drinks - good signature cocktail collection and great beer/wine selection. Flavors in the cocktails a little weak, but that's a personal preference. Apps - Jalapeno cornbread: excellent. Not too spicy and served warm. Also the lobster quesadilla: very good. It's hard to mix lobster with anything and still taste the lobster, but the overall flavor was tasty. Entrees - Cheddar burger - son says it's ""huge and awesome."" He's a tough crowd, so I believe him. Came with a huge mess of fries. Salmon with red quinoa and sauteed spinach - daughter says the salmon and the spinach were excellent. Quinoa could have used a little moisture from something - maybe some more spinach? Diver scallops with acorn squash risotto: excellent. Risotto done right and perfect, huge dry scallops that were actually scallops. I ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp and grits with tasso. Seriously delicious. It could have used a little more heat, but I get that some people don't like that. Dessert - Pineapple upside down cake(off menu), apple brown Betty, and chocolate mousse - all very good. The total was right around $200, so very reasonable for the mountain of food. We will definitely go back and recommend."
"A quaint place with full bar, a decent menu and friendly service.We had two different cocktails which were made great; Raspberry Mag Mile Mule and Manhattan. We sat in the bar to watch a NFL game with a 1 year (sat in a booth). Bartender was very friendly and they use an iPad to show there impressive wine list, beer and signature cocktails.We also had the blue cheese fondue housemade chips...delicious! We will be back!"
"Going off of the nice reviews we dined here for breakfast this morning. We ordered the American Classic, pancakes, and an omelet. The food was nothing at all to write home about. Very mediocre to almost bad! The service was pleasant. Overall though, not enough here to cause me to want to return."
This place was not good.  They do have a good strong cup of coffee but that is about it.  They messed up my husband's order and our food was cold.  Disgusting. It's overpriced.   Fast but not worth it.
Fancier than I had hoped for but great service and the meatloaf was excellent. Nice atmosphere and friendly people.
"It's in my neighborhood, so I tried brunch here.  The breakfast was decent, but I was able to get an order of cornbread, which made my day.  The cornbread really is a must try if you love southern cooking.  Service was nice, and the patio was pleasant.  I'll be going back."
"I don't see the reason for the great reviews that this restaurant has received.  The French dip was on soggy, over-buttered bread with salty sauce, and it was served with French fries that were, in equal parts, laden with oil and sea salt.  My companion had a steak salad with lettuce that was drowning in dressing.  Any extras? Anything exceptional?   Not even enough to take home. A $50 lunch for two persons, without beverages, alcohol or dessert is pricey, by anyone's standards."
The Friday special perch with wild rice is amazing and the lobster salad as well. Our server even comped us dessert. Great service !
"Took my 14 year old son to The Local for dinner and had a wonderful experience. Atmosphere is nice subtle Americana. Service was top notch, fast and friendly. From our primary server to those supporting him all were very nice. The food selection at The Local is a wide variety of American comfort food but dressed up a bit. I enjoyed the Chicken Pot Pie with plenty of chunks of chicken and a nice puff pastry on top. My son ordered the TLC burger with added bacon. This was about the thickest and juiciest burger I've ever seen and he could only eat half! We saved room to split the chocolate mousse which was excellent and a positive first for my son. Finally, for no known reason, the manager decided to pay for our dessert!! What a great way to end our day. Thank you Local."
The liquor selection was not up to par and the chicken soup was fair plus ordered a sandwich which took over an hour to have delivered to my table. Would not recommend this place the table next to me was also having issues with the food one person's food came out and the other didn't come out till far later on in the evening. As the saying goes fool me once shame on you for me twice shame on me I will not be returning to this restaurant.
Went for dinner this past weekend. We started at the bar with a couple dozen oysters. They have a pretty decent selection of liquor and our bartender was really friendly.For my entree I had the sea scallops which were cooked perfectly. The risotto was good but a bit too heavy to be paired with the sea scallops. Other entrees at our table included the meatloaf and baby back ribs which received good reviews. Ordered sides of crimini mushrooms and asparagus which were both good.We finished off our dessert with the chocolate mousse. It was okay; a bit too heavy.
Located in a Hotel but clearly separate as food was not Hotel food. For Chicago price wears good. Good but not great food.
Unbelievable comfort food and huge portions. The service was amazing - the staff have it a homey feel and they all seemed very genuine. Definitely one of my new favorite restaurants.
Came for breakfast. Just ok-- nothing special. Had the frittata and hubby had the basic egg toast bacon breakfast. Just average.
"Great addition to Streeterville!  Delicious comfort food, great service, enjoyable casual Americana ambience.Only thing better than the cornbread would have been complimentary cornbread (or corn muffins or rolls or bread).  That would be my only request - don't cheap out on a bread basket!  :-)But otherwise, we thoroughly enjoyed bacon-wrapped shrimp & grits and a delicious burger with gruyere & portabella.We will be back!"
"The first thing that I noticed was the wonderful aroma that emanated from the restaurant as soon as I opened the door.  That seems to be rare these days.  It felt like I was entering someone's home for a holiday meal.  The service was superb.  The chilled seafood platter is fantastic.  For dessert, the fresh homemade chocolate chip cookie is a must have.  I may have that before my meal when I return.  Can't go wrong here.  Thanks for a great dinner!"
"Generally I don't expect too much from restaurants that are connected to hotels. ""The Local"" however, does a great job of serving good food and providing equally good service. The price points range from the $13 burger to the $40 filet. I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp (huge shrimp x 3) with cheesy grits. It was delicious. I left full and will come back. One side note, this restaurant is very loud. So, if your trying to have a quiet dinner, better find another location."
"From start to finish our experience here was AWESOME.  A group of nine girls for a bachelorette weekend, highly prone to inappropriate dinner conversation ventured in here on a Friday night.The ipad wine list wasn't my thing, I prefer paper, but the other ladies liked. The cheapest drink by the glass is Mark West Pinot Noir, and also the cheapest bottle. Kind of annoying that the glass cost as much as a bottle normally does, but comes with the territory.We order several of the jalepeno bread appetizers for some bread to wash down all the champagne, and it was delicious, not as moist as most, but it got the job done.I had the portobello mushroom burger with a side of the most delicious fries I have had in quite some time. The bride ordered the scallops which apparently sell out every night and said they were outstanding. My other friend got the kobe beef hot dog, obviously just for the hilarity that ensued. She said it was the best decision she made all night. Since I was present for the other decisions, I can attest to that.The waiters were awesome, even when we got personal with our questions about their girlfriends, they seemed to be amused. They brought us 3 bottles of free champagne, and later an assortment of desserts, ON THE HOUSE PEOPLE!  Now don't expect this treatment, you may not be as awesome as we apparently are.We hadn't even complained, so this was amazing service. They were incredible, drinks and dinner were beyond awesome, overall this was a highlight and all my friends loved the place!"
We tried the French dip and the pot pie. Both were great. Service was excellent as well.
"Excellent food, shrimp and grits, skirt steak were awesome! Extremely kid friendly, great service. Highly recommend for families!"
"Came here for breakfast/brunch/lunch on a Sunday-Walked in and wow was it loud, since it's connected to a hotel this may have been the reason-I opted out of the buffet, didn't look like a true buffet for it was in 2 places and didn't seem all that impressive-However this is not fair since I was in Vegas last month and ate at buffets there-I got the silver dollar pancakes and they were just ""ok"" wouldn't want to eat them again-My boyfriend got the vanilla french toast, he seemed to enjoy it-There are better options in the city, as well the layout seemed corny-It could be done to make it a trendy spot-"
"This place was located right around the corner of my hotel, so my friends and I decided to check it out. It was going to be our first meal in Chicago, so the name appealed to me. Food was great. I personally ordered the burger with mushrooms on it (the name escapes me). Damn, that thing was huge. The burger itself was encrusted with mushrooms, and then there was a portabello mushroom on top. The portabello was marinated in some sort of sauce, that I wasn't a big fan of. It made it taste sour, but it was easy to get over. But all in all, the burger was juicy and delicious. We also ordered on of their appetizer specials for the night. Chips with a blue cheese fondue smothered on top. Chips were nice and crispy, and not at all oily. And the cheese was amazing. A bit strong on the blue cheese, if you're not used to it though. Service was good. We were about to order salads to go along with our meal, but our server told us that we had plenty of food coming and probably wouldn't need the salad. I LOVE when servers are honest about those types of things. It's great that he didn't try to up sell us on things he knew we wouldn't need. He also ended up giving us a free dessert, which were not sure why. But hey, 'm not complaining. Free dessert ! I will say though, that I got a weird vibe from this place. It seems confused on what type of restaurant they want to be. There were a lot of fine dining aspects which were great. They even swapped out your napkin if you're wearing dark clothes or light clothes. The hostess was in a suit. The service was comparable to a fine dining restaurant. But then there were other aspects that made it seem like more of a homey restaurant. Chalkboard with the specials on the wall. some of their decorations. The waiters wearing jeans and what looked like a cooking apron. It was just confusing. Not a big deal at all, I just found it interesting."
"We chose this restaurant mostly due to its close proximity to our hotel.  We were greeted and seated very promptly.  Atmosphere was nice, yet family friendly.  We had our three children with us...ages 8, 9, and 13.  Our server, Andrew, was very attentive and helpful.  Food was good.  I had a fish special and my husband had a filet, but I have to say my son's burger looked like the best choice.  We all enjoyed the ""cookie monster"" dessert...generous portion...plenty to share.   We left very satisfied and would go back."
"Our last night in Chicago and we wanted something nice for dinner.  Place is easy to find and fairly quiet for a Chicago food establishment.  Our party of 3 was seated smack dab in the middle of the place, and servers were forced to squeeeeeze by when serving or picking up dishes.  My friend ordered the French Dip which came with fries and a small dish of slaw.  He said it was average at best.  Meat was good quality but the au jus was very salty and lacked richness (watery).  His 12-year-old grandson and I both ordered the Scottish Salmon Reuben.  The boy ate everything, but he has the appetite of a teenager.  I found the sandwich tasteless, and I could not discern any 1000 Island Dressing after working my way through the thick cheese.  The sauerkraut lacked punch, and the slaw had a sour off taste.  Prices were typical for Chicago.  Our server was OK.  Disappointing."
"Okay, my previous review was for the weekend. On weekdays it seems that it's just too hectic for anyone to have any manners. The manager, instead of a ""Good morning"" decides to say excuse me and walk by us while we were waiting to be seated. The waitress decides to fill our coffee cups with half a cup each. ""Can we get some milk for the coffee?"" After five minutes we walk up to the buffet and get our own. Upon her return ""Oh, you wanted some milk, right?"" Yeah, we got it already. Everyone was too busy setting up tables and forgot about customer service."
Convenient to the Westin om Michigan. No prices on menu. Was here for Breakfast.  Buffet is $24 which looks fine - good variety.  Eggs benedict is $10. Have a child's menu which is varied enough.  Nice atmosphere.  Good service.
"My family and I had bkfst here this morning. Staff was very friendly, accommodating to my 2 kids.  Food was good, pretty standard small breakfast buffet, nothing but the 'usuals.'  But $24 for a small breakfast buffet is so overpriced. I get that it's in a Hilton and on the Mag Mile, and again: the staff and restaurant itself was great.  But still no justification for that price - when I've had much better for much cheaper."
Stayed at the Hilton and decided to eat at the restaurant - glad I did!Local beer is awesome.  Wasnt surr what i wanted and took the advice of the bartendar - tuna burger and fries.Tuna was awesome - kimchee on top and added a great taste to the tuna.  The Local is a great place - wish I was a local!!!
"The Local Chicago is ready to hit the ground running...and they REALLY REALLY want you to know it.  I am always happy to have a new neighborhood place, especially one that is open until 2am.  The Local Chicago, the latest restaurant from Chicago Cut Steakhouse owners David Flom and Matthew Moor, replaced Cafe Med on Tuesday night and we happened to stop in on Thursday.First off, the service is fantastic...but a little too fantastic.  It's clear to see that the staff is eager to please.  We were greeted by 3 staff members and probably checked in on 15 times.  I am sure this with will calm down in a few days....but it's very clear that they are excited.I loved the decor.  It seemed comforting and homey.  My dining companion thought it had a weird vibe but that could have been the awkward welcome and overly anxious greetings/service.  On to the dining and drinking.  They have an *awesome* iPad drink selection feature where you could  learn ALL about the wine you're about to pick.  You can pick by country, year, price, varietal...it's fantastic.The serving staff knew their food.  They knew *exactly* how everything was made and for a restaurant that's only 2 days old, that's impressive.  We needed up talking to two of the servers, who both not only knew what was in every dish, they were able to describe the sauces, the bread...everything!The waiters and chef were totally accommodating to our extremely restrictive dietary needs.  They went out of their way to make sure that we were happy with our dishes, even offering extra sauces and checking in multiple times.  The food was fantastic!!  Probably one of the best crab cakes I've had in Chicago and the tuna burger was amazingly well-spiced.That said, the menu was extremely overpriced in a way that is off-putting.  It is unfortunate that we could have walked 4 blocks and had nearly the same menu items but with double the portions for half the price.  Cafe Med offered discount nights, neighborhood specials, and really accommodates hotel guests and actual ""locals.""We may give it a shot in the future...but we will not be in a rush to do so."
"I really like The Local Chicago.  I live nearby and it's a great option to not only eat, but also to hang out and have a drink. I've had breakfast, lunch and dinner here and I am always highly satisfied.  From the salads and sandwiches, to the burgers and chicken, they do a very nice job.  Great location, outdoor seating.  I highly recommend."
I order the cocktail shrimp and thought it will be a regular hot shrimp but it wasn't!! It was cold shrimp. Never again. The non-alcoholic &non-soda drinks was bad too. But the Sandwiches wasn't as bad as the rest.
Nice local bar.  Casual atmosphere.  Great  for locals.
"5 stars for service.Our server Jason was super duper friendly. I felt bad that I was too busy entertaining my 9 month old to chat. Seemed like a genuine nice guy. The food was good! We started with jalapeño corn bread which was delicious.   My ""TLC""  burger was slightly undercooked. A manager(?) overheard and immediately put in an order for a new burger. Had it out in record time and took the meal off the bill! (I wasn't even planning on complaining!)Worth a visit for sure!"
My wife is staying at The Magnificent Mile Hotel this forced to go to this restaurant where everything she has had there has had problems.  Cheeseburger was raw and  fries are really in smooshy she had to tell them to Chris the fries up apparently they can't do simple things. Lobster quesadilla was horrible horrible taste in the guacamole was black what you was sitting around for a long time.   I think Hilton can do a lot better than this the management must be real pathetic.
"Stopped by here for a drinks before dinner nearby at Masaki.Good bourbon selection.  Attentive service. A bit expensive, but acceptable for this type of establishment.Only caveat is that they wouldn't change the TV away from the Blackhawks game, even though no one was watching the TV, and there was a way more interesting NCAA game on.  I guess the owner is a fan?!"
We had a great time at the Local with the only issue being the noise. Extremely difficult to carry on a conversation. All hard surfaces that bounces the noise all over the place.  Reservations made through Open Table without any muss or fuss. But the food was great and the service was friendly and attentive. Their Mac and cheese isn't bad but I guess I was expecting maybe a little bit more than it was. Oysters on the half-shell were good though the seafood sauce needed extra horseradish which was promptly supplied. Had the bacon wrapped shrimp with the grits. Very tasty. Love the cornbread.  The chocolate mouse was very decadent and dense. Will come again and want to try the Sunday special.  Want to especially thank the waitstaff for their attention and good humor.
"came here for lunch and found the food to be just meh, and quite a bit overpriced.  Granted we're in the Gold Coast, but I think I'll take my dolla dolla bills elsewhere."
"I went with a friend for a post birthday dinner.Tyler was our server, he was awesome. The rest of the staff was also very welcoming.The food was great.I look forward to coming back"
"Food, service and atmosphere were all awesome!  We've been there twice now in one week.  First visit my husband and I both had the lobster cocktail for apps, for the main course he had the salmon and I had shrimp and grits.  I have not had shrimp and grits that tasted so good since I moved here from the south.  My husband loved the salmon.  Next visit my husband had the lobster cocktail again and I had the crab cocktail.  He had the filet and said it was just as good (or better) than Gibsons or Mastros.  I had the scallops and they were incredible. The hostess, servers and managers are all very friendly and we love the outdoor patio.  We will definitely go back!"
