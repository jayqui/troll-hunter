"Table, Donkey and Stick"
Stopped by randomly when biking by and to my delight it was their Monday night special.$5 burger with huge portion of perfect Belgian frites$1 highlife and $1 bourbon shot.Felt like I was at an expat bar in the Czech Republic at the beginning of this century.Jon bartender seems like an old friend and I'm excited to try my barmates' new ale from Arcade.
"What is ecletic dining? TDS belongs here because it has a menu that while it's not for you to be fed and stuffed, it's a place where you get to experience, smell, see and taste a bunch of things. Smallish type plates, offal, atypical pairings and strong cocktails set in an intimate, communal setting. Best to come here as a table of 4 and order a bunch of things as I have done.Get the duck liver mousse, beautifully smooth and rich. We got some appetizers like cheese, fried chicken livers, entrees to share and they were all nicely put together. I think we had too much too drink and jokes that night, so I don't remember all the dishes, but it was a good time and I left full."
"This is right out of upscale hipster dining heaven.  I'm basically the asshole Portlandia was written about and I fit right in here.  I couldn't help but notice the mythically giant tree stump serving as the host(ess) podium and asked if it was local...low and behold a staff member who overheard me asking someone else that question and must care as much about that nerdy shit as I do appeared out of nowhere to tell me the 100 acre woods' artifact's story.  And I loved every second of it.  If you made it through my story here's a bit about the food:delicious and complex flavours: check (trust me, I'm picky)fine dining experience: checkmenu changes often: checkgreat staff: checkcommunal tables with no semblance of privacy: unfortunately check, however they are so good I'll go back anyway."
"This place is great.. I seriously considered changing all other reviews to being lower to give this one the higher marks it deserves,  A little out of the way for downtown, but it's casual, yet refined.  The people are very welcoming and casual, yet the food is refined and intricate.  Very special place.. so many unique flavors in a dish.  Seemingly odd pairings that are beyond amazing.  Came with a group of 20 - they have a back room that accommodated all of us perfectly.  The drinks are great from cocktails to wines.   The food is very unusual, and yet incredible.  We had a large shared menu so we were able to try many things.  The halibut, pork, frog legs, charcuterie a and cheese, dessert.. All amazing.  The best?  Unanimous vote.. duck pate!!!  And for the sweets.. Holy moly everything!!!!  The desserts are truly the best selection.. I had ""carrot cake"", ""dulce de leche pretzel"", and ""fried pork rinds with caramel"" and all were fantastic and leaving me wanting more and More and MORE!!"
"The building's exterior on Armitage and that narrow hallway on the right behind the hostess stand felt SO familiar.  Aha!  I had been to TD&S back when it was still Bonsoiree!There are a handful of selections in the appetizer/small plate and entree sections.  On this night, I felt like a burger, so I got the grass-fed offering bunless.  What was most memorable was the square-shaped latkes that were served on the side with applesauce and horseradish!  Man, those were delicious, perfectly fried, and addictive!   Solid establishment."
"I'm a bit selfish when it comes to picking restaurants or places to meet with friends. And one night, I was particularly selfish, and chose Table, Donkey and Stick., a mere 4 minute walk from my place. Hey, he had a car and could easily drive there, so I shouldn't feel guilty, right?I did a late second dinner at Table, Donkey, and Stick with a friend on a Friday night, and it was absolutely delicious. The menu was definitely unlike items I've had before, proven by the fact that we had to google half of the ingredients. Kasha? Fumet? And what's the difference between fluke and flounder? Yup, we googled it all. I was only a little bit embarrassed when a friend searched through my google history the next day. Just a lil bit.We got a small plate to share as well as an entree, and both were absolutely delicious. We ordered the Trout Roe, which had amazing flavors and textures, and the Seared Fluke, which was by far a star (insert star emoji here). The flavors were great, the broth at the bottom was so flavorful, the puree at the bottom was to die for, and the beets added a great texture - it was just an amazing dish. The service was great as well and the servers really know the ingredients in each dish since everything is done in house. I'm guessing no excessive google searches for them..."
"Whenever I talk about this restaurant, I call it Table Donkey or Donkey Stick...the name is just way too long! I can't decide which I like better though. Sometimes I ramble on about nothing and I'm thinking this is one of those times.I loved nearly everything about Table, Donkey and Stick. I think the only slightly annoying thing is that the host stand is located off to the side when you walk in. Everyone who walks in for their first time stands there aimlessly until someone at the host stand calls them over. We were seated at a two top right between the host stand and the window, so not only did we get the nice -5 degree breeze but also the crowding of patrons waiting around our table. YAY! (sarcasm). Aside from that, I was very impressed with everything but most of all the food.They have a good list of bottled beers with about 4-5 on tap at any given time. They usually look to have one amazing super high % beer on their list which I've never had before. This meal it was Kavorka from Solemn Oath, a nice Russian Imperial Stout.Delicious bites I had:Wanderteller $17 for 3 - Pheasant Galantine & Pork Rilettes - Both good meat choices.Point Reyes Cheese - creamy, buttery, grassy - Loved this cheese option!Foie Gras Terrine small plate $18 - apple butter, chestnut - I always feel like a horrible human being eating foie gras but goodness is it tasty! It's always a special treat when on the menu and can taste great paired with just about anything but this dish was particularly great.Duck Meatball entree $23 - Smoked duck breast, grilled cabbage, carrots, egg noodles, duck yolk, comte - I highly recommend this entree. Every bite was delicious and all of the flavors went together quite well.Overall, I had a great meal at Table, Donkey and Stick and would never hesitate to dine here again."
"Pardon me as I continue to explore the 2015 Chicago Restaurant Week. Table, Donkey and Stick is on the 2015 Michelin Bib Gourmand! What exactly does that mean? These restaurants are honored for offering quality food at reasonable prices, but most importantly, they are also frequented by Michelin food inspectors. For $33 per person, you are entitled to a three-course meal. My first course was a house-made rye baguette served with Point Reyes Toma and candied walnuts. It is a farmstead cheese with a semi-hard texture yet very creamy and buttery. The candied walnuts are a blatant contrast that helped bring out the cheese's natural flavors. For appetizer, I had the smoked salmon which was paired with cocoa roasted parsnips, blood orange marmalade, gingersnap, rooibos, and dill. It had a generous amount of salmon that was perfectly done at medium. The fish was fresh and the dish was well-balanced. My entree was the grilled pork pave served with roasted sunchoke, meyer lemon, sunflower seed risotto, and herbs de provence. The pork pave is similar to sausage except in a much more tender texture. The salty red meat was well paired with the light risotto, tangy lemon, and bitter alfalfa sprouts. Dessert was not included with the restaurant week prix fixe menu. We decided to add two orders of ice cream with caramel corn chicharron at $4 each. The chocolate szechuan was unique in which it had a slight spice. It was very rich and creamy. The roasted apple sorbet was the opposite with a slight green-apple sourness. They are both very interesting and bold flavors that are worth a try. Side note, space is limited. Reservations are highly recommended!"
Meh is all I can say neither happy or disapointed. Either way won't be back for slightly above average food.
"I'm very happy with table donkey and stick, I have been a few times now.The monday night $5 burger and other item specials are usually inventive and flavorful.  I will say I was surprised that my burger was smaller than a junior bacon cheeseburger at Wendy's but it's only $5 and it was delicious so my only complaint was there wasn't more of it.  I also had a twice baked potato that night which was great!I've been back for drinks and charcuterie. The charcuterie board is delicious and after 9 or 10pm i think it's half off most nights. I usually sit and eat at the bar.  Bartenders are friendly. Service is quick and with the weekly menu changes and specials always something new to try. I haven't been out back to enjoy their firepit yet but seems like a fun evening plan."
"Really good place, loved everything I got, i was already wasted when I got here. But it is a tasty modern euro experience. i had no idea what to expect, so it was a pleasant surprise everything tasted so good. Duck liver mousse - smooth and creamy, I was blown away by the bread also, it looked like a boner. Water - I drank like 49 glasses because I was drunk and trying desperately to get sober for my date's sake, but to very little avail. She left me tonight, another heart broken. Good fuel for my tears. Waitress - She was nice, took pity on me. Ambiance - think of a greenhouse decorated by a hipster from Eugene, Oregon. Smoked whitefish - tasty and fresh, good mouth feel, if that is a thing. Goat Picnic Plate - Mhmmmmhhmhmhmmmmmmm I wish it was better lit in these fancy pants places, because I cannot tell what kind of good stuff is on the plate until I blindly mop at it with my fork. Would come back for this. I want to come back and get the burger. Two people no booze w/ dessert and tip is $150, for the quality is worth it and i would come back."
"Overpriced and underwhelming. I'd been wanting to try this place for a while and was sorely disappointed. Food was mediocre at best; tiny portions, burned bread (even after we sent it back), and not a lot of choices. Even the cocktails weren't very good and at $12 a pop, they should be mouth-watering. Plus, the patio could really use some sprucing; felt like my drunk uncle's garage after a particularly rowdy party where some stuff got broken. The second star is only because the staff was attentive and nice, the only silver lining in this bummer dinner spot. Steer clear. There are many other delicious places with a better atmosphere in Logan Square."
"Meh. This place is overrated and expensive. Although we came here with a gilt city deal, without one this would be ridunkulous. As for the food, it is overhyped and without any cohesiveness. We started off with some charcuterie that included schweinkopf (pig), probably the best part of the meal, smoked trout (it must have been store bought or really old, pretty dry), and cheese. Then moved onto celery soup, which was overpowered by this sauerkraut powder. It had some salami and a fried oyster which wasn't very fresh.. It looked delicious on the menu but in reality it was a let down. For our entrees, we ordered milk braised goat and strip steak. Milk braised goat sounds salivating but it was not. The goat was so dried out, such a let down. TDS really advertised this dish, especially on Instagram. Beautifully presented but the taste was not there.. As for the steak, it was a bit cold, served medium rare but I think they let it rest for a bit too long. This dish was served with black truffles, why I am not sure because truffles are not in season right now. I was right, because the shaved truffles were there but they were definitely tasteless at this point. The best part of that dish were the fried onions and mashed potatoes. Will definitely not be coming back here. The prices are too high for the quality of food and with such a large selection of amazing restaurants in Chicago, why would I be doing this.. Steer clear. As for the service, it was just average."
"Sadly, I had really high hopes checking this place out, but it really wasn't a favorite of mine. I went with a group of people on Sunday when they have a pre-fixed menu. I chose the whitefish as my starter, the grits as my second course, and the veal to finish. We also got some of the carrot cake and carrot ice cream and the pretzel puffs with mustard ice cream to share with the whole table. Overall, it was ok. The whitefish seemed a little on the dry side which makes me feel like it was overcooked. Then the grits were a little cold - probably due to the plating since it's a thin layer spread over a wide bowl, and the veal was at least 25% fat. The veal actually was my favorite part. It was really good, rich, but just really fatty. The earlier two items weren't anything that spectacular. However, the bread they gave you was fantastic. I definitely enjoyed that. The dessert was also pretty good. I really enjoyed the pretzel puffs with the mustard ice cream. Different and tasty with a great balance of sweet and salty. The carrot cake and carrot ice cream were a little too sweet for my taste buds, but I can see why people really like that too.Overall ambiance and service is great. The staff is attentive, easily accessible, and I think the back area during the summer would be beautiful for outdoor seating. Overall though, the food was only at a 2-star rating."
"I usually get irritable when I pay a lot of money for an entree that turns out to be too small for a meal, but I hold no grudge against Table, Donkey, and Stick because the entree was so good.I had the lone vegetarian entree on the menu, and I can't remember exactly what was in it besides fava beans and morels and radishes, but it was in a light and lovely sauce and the flavors and textures worked really well together.Because it was way too small to be a meal, my friend and I shared a cheese plate after our entrees, which came with three lovely cheeses, some candied walnuts, honey, and good bread.The service was very friendly and helpful, and we didn't have to wait at all for a table (at 7pm on a Monday), and all in all we had a good time."
"Had dinner here last Friday. We sat on the back patio, which was very cute and cozy ... I'll go ahead and give it ""romantic"" once the sun went down and the decorative lights came up. They had a great selection of cocktails and wine. I ordered two of their gin and tonic drink, and they are right when they tell you it's not the standard gin and tonic. Delishhh. I got the halibut and my bf got the duck. Both were very tasty and definitely more filling than I expected when our plates first arrived. I'd definitely go back because I saw a few meals floating around at other tables that I want to try. Also, it seemed like 8 different  people (server, food runner, dish cleaner, water guy, drink lady, app guy, etc.) came to our table during our meal but each of them was very pleasant and noticeably enthusiastic about whatever it was they were doing. Good experience!"
"Overall great dinner and ambience, prices a bit high (special occasion).The concept is green and local and I liked that.  The service is attentive and friendly.  I forgot my scarf and they called me to let me know.    The actual restaurant is intimate and romantic.  The front of the location has many 2 person tables the back of the restaurant has 3-4 small 2 person tables and 2 large, farm tables.  In the winter the tables are cramped with jackets, etc.  However, I can see them being comfortable in better weather.  The reason why I gave them a 3 star score is because I ordered one item and another was brought out.  By the time I got my correct order my husband had already finished his dinner.  It's just weird watching someone eat and then have them watching you eat.  The waitress and the manager apologized a couple of times but really didn't do anything to make it up. For an appetizer we shared the fried oyster.  This small plate was delicious but unfortunately it is a tiny portion (one oyster).  We wish we had more.  My husband ordered the burger and that was phenomenal: it was well cooked and the taste was definitely there.  I ordered the grilled strip loin and that was cooked well.  However, the fried onions on top were a bit salty and every time I bit into my strip loin and had fried onions, it made the entire bite salty for me.  We ordered two cocktails: the bourbon sour and the Oaxacan old fashion.  Both were fantastic and accompanied the dinner fabulously."
"I went to Table, Donkey and Stick for the first time with a group of 4 last night and we were all blown away. Everything was delicious, start to finish. We start with some charcuterie, duck liver mousse and pork rillettes plus two types of cheeses. The duck liver mousse was out of this world! The appetizers followed - roasted beets and carrots salad for me with a delicious hazelnut creme fraiche. I went out on a limb with the Duck Meatballs for my entree. I was not disappointed. While I'm not sure they tasted much like duck or looked like meatballs, they were truly incredible. More of a sausage on top of egg noodles. It was a very playful take on spaghetti and meatballs. We finished off with an incredible carrot cake. What's not to love? I'll definitely be back!"
"My review may be skewed as I had very high hopes for Table, Donkey & Stick. We went on a busy Friday night during Chicago Restaurant Week. The atmosphere is quaint yet lively. I liked the mix of community and private tables. I was surprised by the portions, which were huge, so come with an appetite. The food itself fell flat. I didn't feel anything we tried was unique or interesting, though it was prepared fine. Of what I tried, the duck mouse was the standout. I don't like duck traditionally and this creamy mouse was really tasty. I had the pork loin entree, in which the pork was cooked really well but the meyer lemon overpowered the whole dish. I wouldn't be opposed to go back but I don't think it would be at my suggestion."
"D E L I C I O U S!!!Came here for drinks about a year ago. John is wonderful! Super knowledgeable and just a sweet guy all around. Returned last week with my brother for dinner and it was so so good.We ordered: the Muffato from the cheese menu with rye baguette, the fried squid from the Monday specials, the poached young carrots, and the seared halibut. I don't recall the name of the dessert, but it was just as tasty as everything else. The service is great, the ambiance is relaxing and warm, and the food/drinks are top notch. You cannot go wrong by paying them a visit :) I know I'll be returning for more."
"Really enjoyed my experience here!  We ordered a charcuterie plate with 3 different meats and cheeses.  The schweinekopf was delicious and the fresh bread went perfectly with everything. I had the duck ballottine for my entree which was also very well prepared. Overall, great service, delicious craft cocktails and food.  I will definitely visit again soon!"
"Came in a group of three on a snowy Sunday evening without a reservation & the only spots available were at the bar! Highly recommend making a reservation, especially since they have a pre-fixe menu on Sundays for $29 that features their menu highlights. The spot at the bar ended up being perfect for our group.  The bartender was pleasant, knowledgeable and made sure to ask us how our drinks and food were.  She even highlighted the patio in the back, where they have a fire pit and blankets for customers to enjoy while sipping on one of their cocktails.The pompadour cocktail was not overly sweet, strong, and well-mixed. The burger came with an apple-mustard topping and aioli on the side that were great complements to the simple burger and homemade pretzel bun. It came with a side of cubed fried latkes that were an interesting twist on potato side dishes, but a little too salty. The burger wasn't WOW, but I'm intrigued by the rest of the menu and would probably come back for the ambiance and patio."
"Honestly this place is just great! Full disclosure: their strategy, in general as it seems to me, is to add a lot of value to relatively cheap ingredients and maintain a mid-range price point. So you're less likely to eat swordfish here and more likely to have ultra dope potato pancakes. Having said that, they do a great job with the food.Also, their staff is great--fast, very friendly, and fun. I'd highly recommend this spot!"
"Stopped here early Tuesday evening, just after opening, without a reservation and they seated us in the back room - not as cosy as the front space with the bar, but I suppose they were going to get busy...It has a limited menu, which in some respects is a good thing in a restaurant, but it was an interesting selection and what we had was very good. Started with a couple of small plates; the pretzel and the braised snails, followed by the duck meatball and the alpine burger. All very tasty food. Only criticism I had was that the burger was a little bit over seasoned, but coming from the heart disease capital of the world I devoured it!This is a really nice place and I'll definitely be back when I'm not hurrying to get to the airport."
"Excellent service...very good food...solid cocktails...very small, very loud. Worth a try though...I was not disappointed."
"Great find, Travelzoo!I bought a voucher for a 5-course prie fixe menu for two at the chef's counter, really glad that I did! With the meal came a course of charcuterie, carrot and beet salad, celery root soup with fried oyster, roasted pork loin and carrot cake to close it out. We also were given a complementary beverage at the beginning of the meal, all for $79 plus tip/tax.The three courses that stood out were the charcuterie, roasted pork loin and carrot cake. The foie gras on the first plate was absolutely unreal. I was incredibly impressed with how rich and tasty it was. Paired perfectly with a fresh loaf of bread.The pork loin was the next dish that really impressed. Served with sunflower seed risotto, greens and meyers lemon, the flavor combination was really great.The carrot cake was freaking unbelievable. Served with carrot ice cream, cake, lavender oil and one or two other things I missed, this dessert was very impressive. It was sweet but not overwhelming, I really enjoyed it.Another noteworthy mention was the service. Everyone was very friendly and welcoming. Our server, Corey, was really into the explanations of all the dishes, I was impressed with his knowledge and selections for the evening.Overall, I would absolutely come back given a similar deal. The menu looked great but may be a little pricey for what you get."
"I really don't see what the fuss is about. Very average yet over priced. The charcuterie was tasty but the portion size was very small. Adding insult to injury, we had to buy bread to accompany it. My burger was good, but it certainly wasn't anything out of the ordinary and didn't equal its $15 price tag. You can get far better and original burgers at Bad Apple or Kuma's. The two people I was with enjoyed their entrees but felt they were overpriced as well, especially considering they left hungry. The wine list was meh and there's almost no space so you have to sit elbow-to-elbow in tight communal seating. Service was adequate and pleasant but not especially attentive. All in all, we paid over $200 for a  $125 experience."
"Cute place for brunch, loved the outside seating, but en-glassed inside seating was wonderful as well. Brunch entrees are smaller than usual, but with a drink, the amount felt just right, which is a rare post-brunch feeling! Fried chicken was incredibly moist, smoked trout plate should have had more trout. Bloody Maries with a kick! Very sweet service.Ideally, I would come here for the outdoor firepit, drinks and dessert.Dinner is good, enjoyed all of our dishes, although the portions are smaller than usual (but realistically, it's probably the right amount of food)."
"If I could I would give 3.5, not 3. I bought a deal with Travelzoo and it was 40/person for a 5 course dinner with a glass of wine seated at the chef counter. I think it is a good deal! The place is small and has a good vibe. It is in a small old house in North Wicker Park. But, it is nicely decorated. People working there are all young. We got: - a charcuterie with: - duck liver mousse (awesome), smoked fish and galantine . The three of them were very nice!- foie grass with apple butter and bread crouton (just ok!);- scallops with a very tasty cream and vegetable spaghetti (good but I had better of the same type);- pork with vegetables and lemon (ok)- carrot cake with carrot icecream (delicious!!!)I think the outstanding of the night were the charcuterie and the desserts. The other dishes were ok, interesting but not outstanding. Overall, it was a nice experience and I would give another try to this place."
"The food: 1/5. Frankly, the food sucked. They try too hard to be innovative but in the end their ingredient combinations don't work when it comes to taste or texture. We started with a pretzel, which was exactly what you would expect but instead of a cheese spread it came with some kind of cauliflower purée. I love cauliflower but the taste was so strong I couldn't stand dipping the pretzel. We also had pork rillettes which were bland and you had to order bread separately. Really? What kind of charcuterie doesn't come with bread or crackers already? Instead of mains, I ordered the grilled sardine and crispy chicken livers. Both were so unpalatable as I only had a few bites. Sardines require an acquired taste and I enjoy them if they're crispy. This dish came with one sardine that tasted like it was out of a can on a bed of lettuce in some white sauce that tasted like some kind of tart goo. Crispy livers were ok, came with green peas which did not work with the crispy texture. My foodie in arms had their duck, which was probably the best dish among the rest of the mediocrity yet nowhere near as good as some other places in the city make it (ie Boho). It came with underdone broccoli dipped in green goo. They get 1 star for the drinks because their bartender is great. The service: 5/5. The service was great, very attentive and our waitress knew the menu well. The music selection was great too and we enjoyed their laid back vibe. Overall: 2.5/5. Skip the food and go for a drink."
"We made the decision to come here for a quick later dinner this past Saturday night...9 pm reservations were acquired at 7:30 pm that night, so that was a pleasant surprise.  There is nothing more than having a craving and not being able to fulfill it!First of all, the drinks were fabulous, even though they appeared to be tiny. I think at one point, my husband made a remark - ""I thought I was getting a drink and not a shot...""  I love anything that has walnut liquor in it, so I was off to a good start.    From reading all the reviews, the duck mousse was supposed to be fab, so we ordered a trio from the charcuterie, since lots of other things sounded good as well.  Even though the mousse was good, the tongue and especially the smoked trout that we ordered was even better!  I forgot how good beets and smoked fish go together.Their cheese selection looked excellent as well, especially the Point Reyes, CA cheese, which we haven't been able to find in any other place outside of California.  Great chef/buyer!  After the charcuterie, we shared 3 small plates - rabbit, smelts and the salad, all pretty good...might be just a tad over-salted.  We loved Bonsoiree, so its nice to find a local place that has some good drinks and chow!   Good atmosphere as well and nice acoustics, even though you are close to the table next to you - its hard to hear them and no problem in hearing your companion."
"We had a great time!My wife and I had wanted to go to TDandS for a while and used to go to that location when it was Bonsoiree.  We had very fond memories of Bonsoiree so were interested to check this out just to see what they did with the location.I purchased a 2 person, 5 course dinner over travelzoo at the chef's table (small, 3 seat table).  Every course was outstanding... probably our favorite was the appetizer course was smoked whitefish and a really smooth duck liver mousse... also the gravlax with herbs and sunchoke pancake.  There are so many great restaurants in Chicago: I think the best compliment i can pay a restaurant is that we hope and plan to return.  We are definitely planning to return to Table Donkey and Stick."
"Where to begin with Table, Donkey and Stick...My brother recommended the place for my mom's birthday dinner because she wants to try Girl & the Goat. As you have to wait a few months to get a table at Girl & the Goat, this place is a great alternative! I was really excited that I made reservations earlier in the week as a day or two after I did so, an article came out that Michelin added Table, Donkey and Stick to their Bib Gourmand restaurant list (list of great restaurants that are more affordable than their starred counterparts) for the first time! YAY! That means, make your reservations NOW. The place is bound to have a waiting list to get a table very soon.I went for dinner last night and it was FABULOUS! Let me give you one tip if you're a Table, Donkey and Stick virgin - don't look at the menu before you go for the first time. Just trust Michelin and everyone who has commented that the food is absolutely delicious! The food pairing descriptions will leave you scratching your head. This is the time to just dive right in and order whatever the waiter/waitress says are her faves. We split the Wanderteller, a few small plates, and dessert. We had an absolutely superb meal and left the restaurant very satisfied, content and not overfull! (It's always a plus when someone doesn't have to roll you out of the restaurant like Violet in Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory).Here are some of my must tries from last night's meal (read if you dare):Pheasant GalantineCured Lamb BellyRabbit BallotineSmoked Ham HockPeach SorbetBeet Cheesecake"
"I've been here once before and had an ok time but sort of wrote this place off. I happened to end up here again last night and it was a great experience. We were happy to find out they were previewing their prix-fixe menu for restaurant week. It included a cheese or charcuterie, a starter and an entree. All of it was really great! Started with a raw cows milk blue cheese and schweinekopf. That was maybe the best blue cheese I've ever had.Then came the smoked salmon and beets and carrots. The dishes were simple and delicious, like most of the food here. The salmon came with some kind of smoked root vegetable (parsnip maybe?) that was a highlight of the course.We finished with duck meatballs and pork tenderloin. The duck balls were just perfect, juicy but the outside was perfectly crusty. The pork was served with sunflower seeds and sunchoke, which I though worked well and gave the dish a cohesive theme.The whole thing was a super good deal too. One of my new favorites in the neighborhood. I'll be keeping an eye open for future prix-fixe menus."
"I am mad at myself for not coming here sooner.  I initially dismissed it as possibly being too meaty.  That was stupid.  We were blown away by everything.  We used to love Bonsoiree and its cool to see how they updated and totally changed the interior.  Its very cool and cozy.  We sat at the chef's area/bar so my boyfriend's only complaint was that the chair becomes uncomfortable for him after awhile.  I do like that they have hooks under the bar as well as hooks on the wall for coats.  The seats have backs so you can store your stuff there too.We tried 3 of their cocktails.  I had the top two rye drinks.  They were both wonderful!  My second drink was served in a really cool antique champagne cocktail glass.  My boyfriend got the mescal old fashioned which was interesting.  Its smoky like how you want a peaty scotch to be.To start we had the smoked fish for me, and some aged (was it lamb or goat?) for my boyfriend.  The fish was outstanding!  I was already in love but this made me totally smitten.  They also included a hot baguette what was awesome on its own.  We asked for butter.  I was enjoying the bread as-is but then it became a vehicle for me to eat that creamy delicious butter.  It was better than ice cream!Then we had a carrot and beet salad.  This time the beets were the star!!  (my last two ""beet"" salads were seriously lacking in beets which drives me crazy) It was nicely balanced and seasoned.  There was a nice crunch with the sprinkle of pistachios.Then on to a scallop dish that was like a soup but not really.  It was comforting.  The scallops were sweet and perfectly prepared.  My boyfriend doesn't like fennel but I noticed that he ate it all.Then for our mains I had a sweet potato dish that was rustic and satisfying.  My boyfriend took a bite and was surprised by how good they made sweet potatoes taste.  He had the coffee smoke ham which was the star for him.  He was totally crazy for that ham.  It looked great.Then came dessert.  We had what has found its way to the top of my ""best desserts in Chicago"" list.  Whoa.  It was puffed pretzel with dulce de leche ice cream and candied mustard seeds.  So $@%$#%$#@ good!  I think we both had dreams of it last night.  I know we will return with hopes that they're still making it.  I know everything was seasonal so you never know!Finally I don't know if I've mentioned it yet but the staff was amazing.  So friendly and accommodating.  You can tell they all take pride in what they're doing.  I can't wait to return to try more things!  This is a new favorite."
"I had high expectations for this restaurants after seeing Yelp reviews and general impressions on other websites. We were a group of 10 people and we occupied half of the restaurant's main room in the back. The atmosphere and level of noise were great for a good conversation. Service was good too.Unfortunately, both of these two elements were completely offset by the terrible food. The grit and the scallops were barely edible, while the smoked white fish was disappointing and the veal was just ok.Avoid."
"What an interesting and fun place that we got to try last week!!! First of all, the name of the restaurant is definitely one of the most unique that I've come across. Here's some four one one about that taken from their website:STORYTable, Donkey and Stick refers to a Brothers Grimm tale in which three brothers leave home to apprentice for a carpenter, a miller and a turner. The carpenter pays the first brother with a table that magically sets itself with rustic delicacies, which is promptly stolen by a wicked innkeeper. The miller gives the second brother a donkey that shits gold coins at the word ""bricklebrit."" The innkeeper robs him too. The third brother receives from the turner a magical stick which beats the innkeeper until he returns the table and donkey.Our group of 6 had a great table next to the open door/window. It was a little too hot that evening, but it's still better than the frigid subzero temps that can happen during the winter here in Chicago. Anyway, the menu has some interesting dishes and we were happy to tell our server ""one of each"" under the ""WANDERTELLER"" section and ""one of each"" under the ""SMALL PLATES"" section.That means that we got to try a good variety of stuff that this place is starting to be known for.WANDERTELLER: pheasant galantine, pork rillettes, schweinekopf, smoked trout, duck liver mousse, cured duck breast, chamomile & cocoa nib salami, sumac cured pork. I honestly don't remember which was what, but I can tell you that I liked everything that I tried on the board. I actually really like duck liver mousse, so it went really well with our baguettes and little plates of whatever jams and other sweets they brought out to complement the flavors of our meat board.SMALL PLATES: swabian pretzel, crispy tripe, local greens, summer vegetable salad, golden beet borscht, roasted watermelon & tomatillo, and lamb sausage.Our entire table was pleasantly surprised with the crispy tripe, which came with house giardiniera and mustard greens. For those of you who do not care for the usual slimy chewy texture of tripe, this was kind of actually like pork rinds...so crispy and delicious! I can't say that I was a huge fan of the lamb sausage, but that's only because I'm not a huge fan of lamb (or anything gamey, for that matter). I'm hoping to come back another time to try their burger. I know it's a little ""boring"" for such a unique restaurant with interesting menu, but I can't help but continue on my quest to try to find my absolutely favorite burger in the city!"
"Great patio on a nice day! Came here with another couple for dinner, and was very impressed. Great beer selection, as well as delicious craft cocktails (Logan Blvd was great!). Food was superb, and had one of the best charcuterie boards in Chicago, as well as one of the best burgers in the city. Service was excellent, the waiter refilled waters when they dropped below half. Even as we were leaving, at least five employees thanked us for our biz! We will be back!!"
"Went here for restaurant week and it was packed. We had a reservation and there was still a wait, but that is understandable. The food was okay, bit pricey in my opinion. They turned a corner section of the bar into a table they seated us at. This table came with a free chorus performance by the staff. ""CORNER!"" We were seated ""CORNER!"" at a table right next to the ""I NEED A RUNNER!"" kitchen entrance where ""RIGHT BEHIND!"" the servers and chef would yell ""CORNER!"" so they would not run into another person coming out. It was hard to ""RIGHT BEHIND!"" ""CORNER!"" have a conversation ""I NEED A RUNNER"" sitting at the ""I NEED ANOTHER RUNNER!"" table. Different waitstaff yelled it in different tones so it wasn't as monotonous, but it was almost constant the entire time.The table was also located right in front of a chef station preparing food if you do not mind it. The chef there was super nice and was helpful in explaining the dishes. Another downside to the table was that it had the most uncomfortable chairs. Between a course I had to stand and eat, luckily the bar counter is high enough it was not too much of an issue to eat standing.I wouldn't go back because for what it is, the food was just a little expensive. As for the table, I think it should be an option to sit there and not be seated there. The entire staff was nice to end it on a positive note."
"Items Selected:Bacon Steak - Fried Polenta, Gorgonzola, Picked Onion, Mushroom Jus, Poached EggFried Chicken - Smoked Potatoes & Corn, Chard, Spicy Aioli, Fried EggDuck Sausage - Biscuit and Gravy, Caramelized Kale, Poached EggPeach Coffee Cake - Brandy Whipped Cream and Oat StreuselPretzel Bread Pudding - Cherry Jam, Lemon Curd, Candied PecanOriginally planned for dinner during my first day in town but later rescheduled to brunch based on a noon-time menu that appeared slightly more interesting than that offered at night it was just after 12:30 that my sister, her fiancée, and I arrived at Table, Donkey and Stick but with the dining room completely empty and only one table seated in back our experience would prove a mixed one at best - the decidedly disinterested service of a questionably stoned server paired with the kitchen's blunt refusal to serve any charcuterie despite its obvious ease of preparation showing an obvious disregard for 'customer service' and thus leaving a bad taste in our mouths despite three excellent savories and a pair of pleasant sweets.  Obviously a 'hip' place featuring all the right moves to lure in the trendiest of Logan Square diners with hefty wood tables, exposed ceilings, and brick walls lit by Edison bulbs beneath a soundtrack of 80's pop nostalgia it perhaps should come as no surprise that service at Table, Donkey and Stick is a perfunctory exercise and with a cocktail list nearly as long as the well-culled brunch menu it would take mere moments to craft our order...plus another fifteen minutes to actually place it as our server was self-admittedly (and unapologetically) ""chatting"" with the table in back as we sat without even water, a young bartender intently polishing glasses  and otherwise oblivious to the ongoing abandon.  Eventually attended to in an off-hand matter it would fortunately not be long before the otherwise idle kitchen lurched to life in preparing our two-course order and with the trio of savories all arriving as they were readied the skillset of the kitchen and quality of ingredients would thankfully outshine the rest of our experience, each dish a dynamic balance of proteins and local produce prepared with a deft hand and dynamic textures throughout - the tender pork-steak and smooth polenta a particular favorite of the group though the bitter caramelized kale set against fluffy biscuits and gamey duck sausage was quite impressive, as well.  Moving next to a duo of sweets it was unfortunately here that the kitchen would falter because as much as the coffee cake would prove reference standard beneath a dollop of aromatic cream the French Toast styled bread pudding would arrive entirely unbalanced with nothing to suggest the savory or saline aspects of a pretzel, the flavor profile instead skewed entirely towards the sweet while excessive amounts of butter rendered the plate far too heavy, a situation that probably could have been remedied by a bit of traditional Kosher salt in the pretzel base or perhaps by stealing a note from the coffee cake and adding a bit of brandy to the excessively sweet fruit."
"I came here with the travelzoo dinner for 2 with 5 course chef's choice along with 2 alcoholic drinks. The first course was a chachuterie platter, which I usually don't care for. However, this place did a great job on the presentation and the platter wad dressed with nuts and herbs. There was duck liver mouse (da bomb!!), grasseola was the aged meat (goood flavor), cantal cheese dressed with honey and nuts. The house bread was toasty hot.  2nd course: my favorite roasted yellow beets and carrot salad with pistachio creme fraiche and arugula salad. It was tasty and refreshing. 3rd course: slow braised goat with onion tart. The meat was tender and well braised. 4th course : pork shoulder with risotto. It was okay and tasted more like ham. At this point, I was already full and didn't enjoy this as much as the previous course. 5th course: puff pretzel with dulce leche ice cream and chocolate ganache. It was good balance of sweet and savory. Overall the travelzoo voucher is a steal for a 5 course chef choice and 2 wine for a Michelin rated restaurant. The portion was very generous and good. I was bit disappointed that both entree choice were meat. If I knew, I should've requested a meat and a seafood/ veggie entree which would be more balanced. I would return for the chachuterie platter or maybe to check for seasonal menu? The service was attentive, but a bit too loud and difficult to conversate."
"I really, really wanted to love this place. I drooled over the menu for weeks before my girls' night dinner plans here but sadly left feeling let down.I made every attempt to try something new and chose items that I'd never had before specifically to ""go big or go home"". I'm an adventurous eater so I trusted them to choose a menu that would please.Drink -Kina Mielle = it might've been the Vermouth that made me dislike this oneWanderteller - Duck Liver Mousse = very interesting; salty; not something to eat by the spoonful but I think it'd be good on a sandwich, not sure I would get it again thoughPheasant Galantine = normal tasting sliced meatMountain Gorgonzola = good, moist, but not extraordinaryRye Baguette = good, normalEntree - Rolled Fladle = too much mushroom for me :-( the dough tasted a bit like crepes but overall there was simply too much filling and too many mushrooms on the plate (it was an overload); the lima beans and beets were good thoughOverall, I was a bit disappointed and resented spending $50 on a meal where I thought I would be in gastronomic heaven.However, the staff was wonderful and the atmosphere is excellent. I may give the food another shot, but so far, round 1 was not good."
"Excellent food! Perfect portions (normal sized. I recommend sitting at the counter where the guy prepares all of the charcuterie items. Very informative and convinced me to try the duck liver mousse, which I never in a million years would have gone for, and it was outstanding!! I really enjoy the fact that everything they have is made in house, and they use local organic products. Check it out!"
"The burger here is frakin good! Enough said! I would be back for that alone. They also have a good drink selection and knowledgeable staff but the service is a little slow, we waited a long time for out food and it was a weeknight. I also enjoyed the atmosphere, the place had a great vibe to it which is important to me. I will be back for that burger!"
"I came here on a Monday night with my roommate because we live nearby. We saw that they have $5 specials on Monday and have been dying to try it so we stopped in. We were sat right away on their patio, which was really cute and cozy. On Monday nights they have 50 cent beers!!! (squeals of excitement) They also had a $5 burger. The burger being offered at the time had a cheese bun, with tomato mayo, cheese, and an onion ring. It was actually a pretty damn good burger. They are on the smaller side, so next time I would get 2 of them and make it a full meal. We also decided to try a meat and cheese plate. We decided on the cured duck breast, which was awesome, and 2 of the cheeses. I can't remember what they were but one was smoked paprika goat cheese and the other was a hard aged white cheese, both delicious. The plate came with sunflower oat bread, which had been grilled (yum) and candied walnuts and honey. I really enjoyed the food here and would love to try some of the other items offered on the menu, but the Monday night specials they have will definitely have me coming back here for beer and burgers. Also, the service was very friendly and helpful!"
"Really fun place! We sat in the back which had a little fireplace going and was surprisingly warm for being a tented area. Long tables that everyone fills in at giving it a more family style feel without being family style. We ordered the pretzel with cauliflower dipping sauce for dessert, rabbit appetizer, and specially slider burgers for dinner. They used to come with fries but now don't so we were a little disappointed. Overall everything tasted great and we really enjoyed our evening. Its a big pricy and the food names were all super fancy. I am a food lover (based on yum noises) but I don't need all the fancy foofoo which is what your paying for unless you get the deals like our $5 sliders."
"Great place! Fun atmosphere, although the space is quite small. The good people at TD&S were kind enough to seat me without a reservation, although they informed me that I needed to be out in an hour due to others with resos. The pretzel with the cauliflower comte is a MUST! So simple, but one of my favorite dishes of the night. The chacuterie is also fantastic, I highly recommend the duck country pate and the salami. The rabbit dish was phenomenal. I will definitely be back!"
Went here as this was a restaurant in my a la card deck. I have to say I discovered an amazing gem and I will be recommending this place to all my friends. Staff (especially bar tenders) are all extremely nice and the food was out of this world!!!
"Love this place. Very whimsical! We usually start with a cheese plate and duck liver mousse which is just phenomenal. One of the best I've ever had! Crispy tripe is an awesome app; it's very crunchy and pairs really well with the house giardiniera. For the enter, I had the seared halibut which was cooked to perfection. Beer selection is awesome; found one of my favorites - Brasserie Dupont. Cocktails are awesome and you gotta love the names - like the 'Down for whatever' cocktail which is made with cognac and peychaud's bitters. The size of dishes are on the small side but it's worth it! Their patio is really awesome - check it out! Really cool spot :)"
"I really wanted to like this place.Did not eat here and I am very glad I didn't. They DO NOT WASH the glasses. The 3 compartment sink under the bar (required by law) was not being used. The sighing and eye rolling hostess was clearing used glasses one by one and simply wiping them down with a rag. We watched the bartender re-wipe a glass with bright red lipstick. Then he put it right back into service knowing full well it wasn't clean. Maybe they will start cleaning the glasses properly in the future but imagine what other ""icky"" disrespectful shortcuts they will take."
"Gave this place a try after reading about it on Eater's Where to Eat Brunch Right Now.  It's a very cozy space with limited table seating up front, more in the back, and a small front patio.  The decor is interesting, the large blue painting in the front looks like it was done by a 5 year old.  Maybe to go with the theme that the store is named after a children's fairytale?Service was super friendly.  We were immediately greeted by the bartender and host and quickly seated for our 11am reservation.  Our friends were running 20 minutes late (one of my pet peeves!) but our server was very nice, checking in once in a while to offer us anything while we waited without any pressure.  Hubby really enjoyed the coffee and had about 5 cups.  We definitely had time to review the menu.  The selections for brunch are limited and varied slightly from the menu on the website.  When we did order, he tried the Duck Sausage (okay) and I ordered the Fried Chicken with a side of the Biscuit.  At first I didn't recognize my dish because the chicken was cut and friend in boneless pieces, so it mixed in with the accompanying potatoes.  It was good with the egg sunny side up.  The biscuit was dense but I liked the texture and flavor.  Our friends enjoyed the 3 Egg Skillet and the Pretzel Bread Pudding with Orange Rhubarb Marmalade.  The portions of each dish were great for one person.  It started getting busy after 11am so reservations are recommended for brunch.  Despite this our friends wanted to stay and chat some more after we paid the bill.  We weren't rushed out, but I also didn't want to overstay our welcome.  Perhaps we'll come back to try out dinner sometime."
"Q: What is ""alpine-themed,"" and am I adventurous enough?""What we have here is a pig's head, blended with spices. You've got the basic texture of ham, but softer."" This is voiced by a man in a green paisley shirt, his face flushed from the heat in this covered porch where we sit, just the two of us, in the exact middle of a long wooden table. Neither of us will talk to our neighbors on either side, nor will we order the pig's head. I get the smoked trout and spit part of it (there was a bone) into my napkin. The lady beside me discusses crates of cilantro and I think, maybe I'm a little outside my comfort zone at this place.Out of my comfort zone: 4 stars. We all wonder often enough if we're appropriately adventurous. One day you'll be immobile and drooling in an armchair, wishing you'd tried the spiced pig's head or skied down the bigger slope or said yes to that frightening possibility you are thinking of as you read this.This is the kind of place that creates luxuriantly the impression that you are on the edge of adventure. The maitre 'd  stand is a giant tree trunk (that you will be gently chastised for leaning against). The tables are crowded together and lit by the whiskey selection in the bar. This restaurant hopes that, warm with good food and drink, you will soon be discussing Europe with your table neighbors, laughing raucously, no longer strangers. The food suggests that you deserve to glimpse, nay, imbibe, a world in which more interesting things can (AND WILL) be done with potatoes.Butternut squash with bacon, onions, unknown greens. Savory duck meatballs with egg noodles and fennel. Carrots and beets, impeccably spiced. I'm not a food critic, but see how I barrel recklessly ahead? ""Savory"" and ""spiced"" are just smirking words to say: the food was pretty good.This restaurant is ""alpine-themed"" because the waiters look like they spent a year living at a farming co-op in a suburb of Berlin. They have mustaches and man-buns. Alpine-themed, because the food is a Logan-Square-culinary-arts caliber version of meat and potatoes and the occasional root vegetable.What if you lived more boldly? What if you said YES to writing a pretentious and rambling restaurant review? What if YOU were alpine-themed, and did not worry whether people thought you were a little silly, fooling yourself with those decorative moose antlers?  We are fooling ourselves as it is.P.S.Don't get the Prima Most if you are not one for the more sour, bitter ciders."
"Had a fantastic experience here on Friday night. It was pretty easy to get a reservation two days in advance, and we got sat immediately. They do have communal tables, so if you don't like that - this isn't the place for you.The duck liver mousse and cheese were amazing and really filing - they make their own bread (which is delicious). We also started with the pretzel, and the cheese sauce is amazing. We shared the halibut at the recommendation of the waiter, and I'm glad we did. We were incredibly full! I wish we had saved room for the pretzel bread pudding, it looked amazing.I'll definitely come back, and hopefully snag a patio spot on a nice night."
"I went back AGAIN...2x in two weeks...phenomenal food, amazing service....even pulled out the mac to let us watch Wallenda while we dined!!!"
"I'm pretty certain that had we eaten in the front of the restaurant - the bar area - this would get at least one more star and maybe even two.  Do not eat in the back.  You walk in the front bar area and your whole foodie-body says: YEAH!...you identify great bottles of booze - the energy is great - the crowd attractive (at least in this light) - oh - so excited.And then they walk you to the back and it's an entirely different world of bizarrely disturbing lighting (not sure where it came from even but it was horrible...foggy and unnaturally colored).  There are communal tables which is fine - but the midwestern sized dude next to me had to ask for a smaller chair so his legs fit.The contrast in the experiences within those few few is jarring.  The service was great - passionate, knowledgeable and fun.  The drink menu is fun though I didn't love my first signature cocktail - syrupy.  The old fashion was better but still a bit thick.  We shared some charcuterie - it was recommended and it was nice.  Not the nicest in town but good.But then the entrees were not as good - really not that good.  We had the monkfish - dull - the veal which was thick and murky - and the goat which was nice.  Then we got the bill which was very not nice - mostly because of the drinks - the food is reasonable enough.  I would not recommend it because I can't get over the unpleasantness of that horrible back space - needs a serious redesign and I'm just annoyed they put all of the creative energy up front where few get to enjoy it."
"A redeeming quality of TDS is the service - rather friendly (although I wouldn't be surprised if hair from one of the staff members' poofy beards ended up in the food). The food itself wasn't that special. Pork rillettes = flavorless. Had more of a greasy after-taste over anything else. Server gave one small loaf of bread for two people. It's not pleasant to eat rillettes alone without something.Green salad = mushy and in some odd cream dressing that didn't have any flavor.Salmon = relatively healthy, but placed on a bed of flavorless sauce and mushrooms. I suppose I'd recommend TDS if you wanted an uppity, faux-hipster date spot and have no problem forking over a lot of $$ for pretentious food, or you're on a diet."
"Oh my goodness, this place is delightful :)I'm going to start with the best part of the experience since most people don't read these reviews all the way through anyway, haha.Our server Jamie was OFF THE CHAIN. Request her. She was the best server I've ever had at a restaurant. She was warm, attentive, professional, and SO knowledgeable. It felt like we had come to her house for dinner, and she was the gracious host. She was incredibly helpful in deciding what to eat, especially because I am not fancy and had no idea what certain foods even were. And her recommendations were spot on! We had the duck liver mousse and goat loin, which were amazing. And the bread that comes with it is so hot and fresh. I could eat that bread all day. We also had 2 of the Monday specials--broccoli beef burger (the best broccoli beef I've ever had) and a sausage deconstructed egg roll (SO flavorful and delicious).I will definitely be back!"
"Popped in for the first time for a quick brunch. Have been meaning to go there for a while but never got round to it.Firstly, Brunch menu looked exquisite. The mixtures of foods and flavours were just fresh and exciting. I was pretty spoiled for choice. I did end up picking the duck sausage, which was very flavourful, fresh and the biscuit had just the right amount of crumble in it.  Service was outstanding friendly, accommodating and down to earth. Will be coming back for more! Great job TD&S!"
"Yes, just yes. We had a 3 top at the Chefs (Charcuterie) Table.Cocktails, food creativity, conversation with the Chef, all excellent.You must do the pretzel and Poached Egg in small plates. The Veal was a bit fattier than I prefer, but the Roast Goat which is cooked for 14 (yes 14!) hours was absolutely amazing."
"The biggest mistake you can make in going to Table, Donkey, and Stick is waiting too long to do so.  I say that for two reasons:  1.  you can still enjoy the fire pit out back before winter hits and 2.  if I had to guess, this place is about to explode in popularity and it will soon be much harder to get a table.We had the pleasure of snagging a seat at the chef's counter meaning we got to watch executive chef Scott Manley work his magic throughout our meal.  He very graciously put up with our many questions and really made for an excellent experience.  The atmosphere is as you would expect from an Alps-themed restaurant - warm, rustic, and casual.  For food, we had:Starters:  pork rillettes, duck pate, and the point reyes toma cheeseSmall plates:  swabian pretzel, ham hocksEntree: smoked turkey thighDessert: sweet potato hand pieI think it's hard to go wrong with ordering, but make sure you start with the Wanderteller selection.  That's really where TDS shines.  When in doubt, ask your waiter for his/her recommendation.  The beer selection is unique and excellent, and the cocktails are great as well."
"We have stopped in for late night drinks and charcuterie a couple times and its a great atmosphere, bar snacks and cocktails/wine/beer!  Very welcoming and knowledgable staff, and they also run specials on the apps after 9! We will be back to try it out for dinner but right now are just very satisfied with late night drinks and cheese!"
"There is something wrong here. With all the fabulous food in Chicago, how does this place hang? You know the ingredients that are added simple to be whimsical and different but without a purpose? That is the epitome of this place. Everything is weird - not weird in a good way (like hmm, that looks interesting, I should try that), but weird in a way where you get to an ingredient in the dish and change you mind and move to the next. We met two other couples here on a Saturday night. The restaurant is pretty small and lacks charm or warmth. We ordered soft pretzels with the cauliflower cheese sauce that were delicious and enjoyed a bottle of brut rose (our first choice of wine was not available) as we pondered the menu. Nothing was jumping out at me, and even the descriptions had me worried.We started with a cheese plate for the table and some roasted carrots. When it came to entrees, my husband ordered the steak, and I got the sweet potato soup and planned on having a bit of his. Soup was an elaborate presentation that felt flat on the flavor. There was sweet note, and a crumbly smokey substance, but nothing that impressed me. I grabbed a piece of my husband's steak and cut through gristle and fat. The meat was low quality and cold when served. It was served with a smokey kale that I enjoyed, but other than the leafy garnish, we were both highly disappointed. There is no room for sub-par steak in Chicago. One of our dining companions had the duck which he took one bite of and declared he didn't like it. Since none of us were particularly thrilled with our meals, we ordered a carafe of wine and looked at the dessert menu. There was three desserts and all were odd. One had celery, one had pig parts, and the other had gorgonzola. WTF? That is not a dessert menu, that is a joke. The waiter mentioned they had walnut maple ice cream and we ordered it, only to be told they were out. We ended up ordering the celery dessert which was straight up gross. I'm a food lover and I have a sweet tooth and I couldn't stomach this. We ordered an aperitif and again...out! Who does the ordering here? Why put it on the menu only to explain to guests that you were actually mistaken? I may be missing the point, but this place is not good. I haven't had many bad meals in Chicago, but this nears the top of the list. Did I mention it was expensive? $180 for our portion (2 people)...yikes!"
"Had no problem making a 7:30 reservation for a Tuesday night....BUT ended up being put in the back of the restaurant at the 'family style picnic tables' which is not ideal for a date at all, especially a first date. We could hardly hear each other as the general noise of the place is VERY LOUD. I'm not interested in straining to speak to my date, or the server ~ or straining to hear them, either.I've been here twice before and had a sweet little 2-top table in the front, and another time outside in the back garden. Both times we were pleased with the table, space, noise level, etc. So, this time it took me a few minutes to get past the crappy seating and disappointment.Why 4 Stars, then? Well, luckily their menu (both drinks & food) made up for the less than desirable table assignment.I appreciate that the menu is not overwhelming. It's got a few delicious & seasonal  things to choose from - and it's still hard to decide.We decided to start with the butter braised snails as an appetizer. It was a tasty mix of fresh leeks, cabbage, and what seemed like radish sprouts (a lot of them), with a few pieces of chopped bacon....but where were the snails?! It was a kind of Easter egg hunt for the snails. We found a few, but agreed that they should re-think the name of that particular dish. It's misleading.When do the 4 stars kick in, you ask?Now. (Lucky for you, TD&S)We hesitantly ordered a bottle of red wine - on tap - (but luckily were seated next to a wine expert who gave us some sound advice) - went with the Carignan, and scored.We chose two different entrees with the intention of sharing.He had the roasted chicken over grits with green peas, and I had the seared fluke with root veggies. Both were outstanding. A perfectly balanced, seasoned main course, that was perfectly portioned, so we weren't in pain trying to finish it. We enjoyed sharing them very much.We agreed to share a dessert and went with the vanilla ice cream with crumbled, caramel-corn churros sprinkled on top. It was like the most delicious, home-made, warm Cracker Jack's on top of the best vanilla ice cream - ever.You just saved yourself, TD&S."
"Table, Donkey and Stick looks like someone literally plucked it out of a story book and plopped it on Armitage Avenue. Love the location and how it's just there, on Armitage, like it belonged there all along. . .Although I sat in the back patio area when I dined here (it was lovely), I think the quaint bar area is where it's at. The bar(star)tender really knew his stuff and whipped me up an awesomely strong martini (Called the Vesper) while I waited for my dinner partner. Once seated, I dined on the hamburger, a seasonal fresh salad and some fresh fish. Everything was fresh, tasty and completely on point. As I type this, I am seriously planning on when I can go back next."
"We have been for dinner before and we stopped in this week for a couple of cocktails and really loved them.  Bartender was super knowledgeable and the drinks were inventive and fun.  You probably wouldn't consider dropping in here for a drink since it's a restaurant, but I highly recommend doing so as there is more here than meets the eye.4 stars because previous dinners were only ok.  5 stars for the bar and drinks.128/365"
"Very mixed review.  The service was really good.  The cocktails were spectacular.  Really creative.  Served in cool retro glasses.  The charcuterie was outstanding.  We really enjoyed our first plate as well-we had the tripe.  But, the main courses left A LOT to be desired.  I would go back if I was getting drinks and a few small plates.  If I was going for a full blown dinner, I wouldn't."
"Great Yelp reviews and Chicago Mag's best of 2013 set my expectations for this place.  We were celebrating a dear friend's new job and he requested ""something out of the norm.""  We got that in this.  The atmosphere is really cool-- a big tree ""stump"" serves as the host's station to greet you.This is really a ""When in Rome"" kind of place, because when we tried to order our regular cocktails (e.g., a Belvedere and soda), we were told we could only stick with the specialty drinks on the menu, as they were short on help.  Poor planning because this was a Saturday night, packed, and I had made the reservation a month prior.The food was good-- unusual and tasty-- but nothing memorable or that I'd want again. The service was a let down here.  Not rude, just inattentive.  Had it been a tad more proactive, I would have given this three stars,"
Tried this place for Monday night $5 burger night. The burgers are small but DELICIOUS. Not a huge place but lots of character and friendly staff. Great beer list and good food. I would go back to try more!
"I thought it was a pretty cool place. The food was excellent. The service was beyond reproach. Yeah, it was expensive. That's life in the big city. I would go back."
"Portion size left something to be desired.  We split the pretzel pretty tasty and only $8.  Ordered 2 co tailed Manhattanador and the punch both were pretty good.  Food peer leg of lamb and the white fish, the fish was a bigger portion.  But the leg of lamb was 5 small pieces and 6 pieces of asparagus and 3 slices of poppy seed bread.   Left me wanting a eat!  Which is sad considering we paid 105 and both left hungry.   Might not be much for some, but it was enough that I expected to leave feeling full.Staff was attentive, fun, but not super talkative about food or options....We probably would not return any time soon and wouldn't really recommend it to friends either.  at least we would warn then about small portions."
"Killer Food, great cocktails, a pleasure to have in the neighborhood.  The only reason this review isn't 5 stars was that the staff was too transparent...an unfortunate side effect of a small/busy restaurant, but servers/hosts were being told what to do (simple requests like ""watch the door"" or ""table so and so needs you) and they were rolling their eyes and sighing right in front of guests.  Or at least in front of those paying attention. I immediately recognized and appreciated that they do all their own bread/pretzels in-house which is no easy feat in a kitchen that size.  The charcuterie is as good as the other reviews mention and a tremendous value for the price, my mistake was I got it mid-course and was immediately full of bread (pretzel then sourdough loaf).  I've been eyeing the menu and wanting the burger for so long that I had to power through my gluttony.  The burger is good. Had a char flavor that covered up that beef/salt flavor I was looking for...but the best part are the latkas they serve instead of fries.  They're amazing! Especially dipped in apple mustard and/or the horseradish aioli. Ok, I'm full.  Time for bed."
"Five $ menu on Mondays, outdoor space with a fire pit, great cocktails, delicious food, with vegetarian options, and friendly staff...recommending the pretzel, snails, and the Logan Blvd cocktail!"
"Cool spot w/ a very nice outdoor patio, especially in the late summer/early autumn evenings.Server was prompt and helpful. Well above-average food (I had the sturgeon and my dining companion had the sweet pepper schnitzel resting atop an awesome 'broccoli mash.') Cocktail menu was full of the typical nouveau-hipster/prohibition-era concoctions you'd expect at a joint like this.I didn't have dessert, but the menu looked impressive, as did the selection of sherries and digestifs. We finished the dinner with coffee and headed over to Scofflaw for chocolate chip cookies."
"Second best meal I've ever had. Table, Donkey, and Stick is a must try in Chicago. Here are the highlights:PâtéChicharonesTonguePolenta with bacon SourbratonBest is polenta and bacon. Holy sh*t!  Second was the wine, last was the service."
"This place was great!  Duck liver mousse is outstanding!  The grits I had (that did not look like any grits I had ever seen before) were tremendous.  All the food was delicious, fresh and creative.  A number of the dishes our party ordered had unexpected ingredient combinations that made the whole dinner a bit of an adventure.  Really great place!!"
"They call it ""Table, Donkey and Stick""; I call it ""Beer, Bread, and Duck Liver Mousse"". Sitting at the rustic bar, glowing in twinkling lights, letting the polar vortex's summer breeze wrap through the open patio doors is my new favorite way to spend the evening in this part of Logan Square. The ambiance exudes a cozy/hipster/outdoorsy/Brooklyn vibe. It's small yet usually accessible perhaps because the California/Armitage intersection has not quite exploded yet. The tap is well-selected and includes many Chicago-area craft brews like Penrose, Solemn Oath, and more. The smiling young bartenders were eager to discuss, if you fancy yourself an afficionado. The staff goes on brewery field trips-- I'm jealous! As others have mentioned, the hearty and crunchy, in-house baked baquettes with duck liver mousse and an array of domestic and European cheeses are the culinary highlights bringing me back to the Table."
"A small and charming place. When you walk in the host stand is absolutely gorgeous and all I could think about is if the stand was hallow and how hard it would be to lift it.  We started off with the wanderteller which have 3 generous portions of your choice with a warm baguette. I've been on a burger kick so I ordered the Alpine burger. It was recommended to get the burger medium rare but it was a bit too much for me so I ordered it medium.  The burger came with mini latkes instead of your tiresome fries. The mini latkes were crisp, delicious, and by far much better than the burger itself.  I definitely didn't think burger was worth the price.I suggest going for the small plates"
"Kind staff, good food and made to order specialty cocktails. I asked for something with citrus, floral, and vodka. I got an amazing elder flower lemon vodka cocktail. Refreshing on a hot summer night. *dancing girl emoji*Also, the Alpine Burger is delicious. Horseradish and apple chutney are an interesting combination that totally works. My only complaint is that they serve Grappa and Amari from Italy... but no espresso... Those digestivi are made to go with espresso... so, having one without the other is... well... it's kind of stupid actually. Overall it is a great place for dinner... that is if you can stand the rather annoying elitist hipster crowed talking about how they want to name their unborn child Armageddon and call him ""army"" for short. I am guessing it was a joke, but one can never be too sure when it comes to this sort of thing."
"This place is really good. the service, the food, the drinks, all great! I really loved the seared fluke and my boyfriend loved the coffee rubbed ham. the beet salad we shared to start was delish as well"
"So I get that this is 'weird woodsy food'. Well, I happen to like weird and I'm pretty peachy on woodsy. Came here the other night with the boo thang, and holy smokes, what an amazing experience. We had some cash to spare (makin' it drizzle, y'all), and I'd been dying to try this spot out since they converted from the last fancy-pants restaurant. I was not disappointed. We had the starter combination- the duck live mousse, pheasant galantine, and an amazing Wisconsin cheese with oat bread. FOR SEVENTEEN DOLLARS? Lovin' it. So fresh, meticulously presented, and honestly? Could have made a meal out of that. However, the fat kid in me (and curiosity to try EVERYTHING ELSE) made us order a small plates and an entree. We split the golden beet borscht, crispy tripe and Alpine burger. All of it was out of this world. I'm a borscht snob (peasant food forever) and this was easily the best I have ever had. Served cold with a gorgeous beef tartare, pecans and tarragon, it took me to my happy-polish-fueled-place. The crispy tripe was severed with house made giardinera- only complaint was that I wanted more of the spicy! For those that aren't keen on triple, give this a try- balanced, earthy, crispy and not in the least acidic. Texture and presentation was killer. The crown jewel was the Alpine burger though- melt-in-your-mouth, served with apple compote and a delicious mystery sauce and MINI LATKES! What a weird, delicious, woodsy journey indeed. Also, the cocktails, service and ambiance were on par. Can't wait to visit again for half priced cheese after 9pm!"
"A nice place. A little pricey for what it is, but the atmosphere is what makes this place."
"I came here for brunch with a friend.  Be forewarned, the menu isn't very brunch-y, it's more lunch with the only thing somewhat resembling brunch being a bread pudding. I had the smoked trout with pea tendrils and latkes.  The trout was super fresh and gently smoked but the latkes were something else all together - not your traditional shaved potato but almost like a mashed potato pressed into a square. It was over cooked  and hard to cut into. To finish off the meal I had a biscuit flavored with rosemary and sides of fresh butter and blueberries. Good but not the best I've ever had.The portions are decent sized - filling but not feeling like you couldn't have a wafer thin mint if you know what i mean.The place is small so I'd recommend a reservation at a time other than brunch. I'll be back for dinner to see if m rating changes but right now it's fine but not life changing."
"We came here on a Sunday night after seeing this place listed on the Michelin bib gourmand list for Chicago. There is a three course prix fixe menu for only $25! I went with the smoked trout, apple salad, and duck breakfast sausage. The trout was so succulent and moist, served with a warm baguette. They smoke their meats in house! Apple salad was so surprisingly refreshing - I never would have thought to combine cumin with apples, but it was an inspired choice. Finally, the duck sausage entree was amazing, but not because of the duck... It came with the best buttery biscuits, wonderfully cooked collard greens, a rich gravy, and a poached egg. What an amazing combination... We also got some items off of the wonderteller, and they were all very creative and delicious. The lamb belly came with pickled watermelon rind (if I remember correctly), and the pork loin had a wonderful chocolaty mustard. This place really does an amazing job at paying attention to detail and creating new, exciting combinations. The wonderful atmosphere adds to the whole experience. Definitely coming back here!!!"
Overly-friendly (In a good way!) staff with delicious small plates! The pork rilletes were artery hardening and joyfully sinful. I'll definitely be back!
"A few of us went to their $20 Sunday special.  On a set Sunday, they bring in a chef from a different restaurant and have a prefixe menu.  It was Filipino BBQ night served by a chef from Sable, which I usually love (both filipino bbq and Sable).  First of all, they served Pork Adobo, which is NOT bbq, but a dish that is usually boiled down to create distinct flavors. It was good but the portions were small.I will try to come back for the regular menu.  Looks like the duck liver is a hit with most."
"Very good food, a friendly staff and a nice accessible bar. Coming in on a weeknight is very pleasant, the crowd is just the right size and shape.The alpine burger with the mini latkes gets the award for best value on menu, the rest is a bit pricey but generally worth it. I had the grilled pork entree which I highly recommend. The sturgeon was great as was the blood sausage starter.Their manhatterhorn cocktail is delicious."
"Not bad, not terrific. Would I go back? Maybe.We headed over to Parson's, and although they had a good number of empty and near-empty picnic tables out back, we were told that it was going to be a 40 minutes wait, so we (begrudgingly) put our name on the list and opted for a stroll down Armitage. We didn't know about TD&S, we just happened upon it and opted for a drink there before--we thought--we'd head back to Parson's. But then we were comfy, and the TD&S menu looked enticing enough, so we opted to stay there.  we were the first dinner customers of the evening.Bottom-line, the pretzel appetizer was okay, but I would have like a bit more salt on the pretzel. Not a real complaint, just a personal preference, maybe the product of too many NYC streetfood pretzels. My vegetarian GF's entree was really sub-par. It loked pretty good but we agree that it was oddly flavorless, especially the ""broccoli mash,"" which looked great but had almost no flavor. We decided that it was mainly a seasoning issue; the plate had little seasoing at all. Also, the main part of the dish, which was fried breaded peppers, looked and tasted like some slices of fried peppers. Insubstantial, idea-wise and taste-wise.I opted for the burger, largely because I had had my mind set on getting a burger at Parsons. It was pretty good, but a bit overcooked for me )though the waitress said that ""Chef likes to prepare the burger medium rare,"" and asked if that was okay with me (and I said yes). Also, the little potato squares--billed as latkes--were too think to be so cooked. They weren't good and even chips of fries would have been a lot better, I'm sure.My drink was good. I can't recall the name. Sort of a Manhattan with Black Walnut bitters."
"I came here for their new year's eve menu and would definitely come back to try their regular menu. Seating was more limited than I thought but my date and I were lucky enough to snag a single table. It was too cold to be outside but there was a fire pit in the backyard and plenty of blankets which I thought was a cute touch. We started off with cocktails at the bar- the old fashioned was everything. Dinner was 5 courses- oysters, sturgeon, foie gras, ribeye, and a fancy schmancy chocolate thing for dessert. Every dish was prepared well but the service stands out to me the most. The foie gras was so rich that I really needed something to pair it with so our server was kind enough to bring by some fresh bread from the kitchen. They also had a really impressive playlist going that night- some Frank Ocean, some Beatles, and even the Roots.. No complaints about this neighborhood gem!"
"This place is special. The girl and I came here for Chef week and both ordered the prix fixe for $45.We started with the duck liver mousse and the pheasant gellatine. Came with a very toasty rye baguette which wasn't sliced so it gave the dish a more rustic feel. Next we had a smoked sturgeon dish and a sweet potato soup. Both had some subtle surprises and delivered with presentation and flavor.Entreé's were a fried chicken dish with cauliflower and a salmon with potato and leek. Both of these were on point and again... little surprises a waited us on the plates.Finally, the desserts were really good and quite beautiful. Olive oil pound cake and a celery root based dish. This really surprised me because celery is known for being very savory and, at first, I didn't like it because it was too savory but the more I ate it the more the subtle sweetness of the other components came in to play and turned the savory dessert in to an actual dessert.I was turned off by their name but finally decided to give it a try. I would recommend it to anyone that is looking for something different and trying to find something that falls in to this cities food culture... Great example."
"We met friends for dinner last night. First time at this restaurant. I have an allergy to wheat, so must order food without gluten. I specifically asked if the butternut squash soup was made with a flour roux. The server said it was wheat free, but had a streusel topping which could be omitted. OK, that would work. All four of us ordered that soup.I started with smoked whitefish (It was ""OK"").Then all four of us received the soup course.....since the server was not our original waitress, I asked about the streusel. Nope...they all had the topping. The server removed my bowl. So while my husband and our friends ate the soup, I waited. My soup arrived as everyone else was nearly finished.MAIN....I had ordered the gluten free option...baked trout. My husband and our friends were served......but my meal was not. They began eating as I sat in front of an empty table.  Finally, my meal arrived, and what I basically received was four tiny nearly raw pieces of trout, with a few tiny pieces of what I came to realize were veggies...all resting on what looked like fettucine. After asking the waitress, I learned the stringy stuff was rutabaga. NOTE: I cook, my husband cooks....we search for and experiment with recipes and new ingredients. I lived in Spain for nearly two decades, where I learned to cook from an excellent one, and ate in top-notch restaurants all over that country. So what is rutabaga? And after tasting it, why in the world would someone make this a centerpiece of a plating. Tasteless!!!My husband ordered the burger (medium) and his friend ordered the same (very rare). When the mains were set down (by another stranger to us), no mention was made ""Whose is rare?"". Neither burger was marked in any way....so the two men each cut their burger in half....the very bloody one was therefore rare.FINAL TALLY:1. Meal....really ""Meh"". Menu -- such confusion (just read the menu) for so little taste. Each plate contained myriad tiny pieces....all un-recognizable.....and really not terribly flavorful. (To be fair, the hamburger plate did have recognizable parts....my husband said the square potato latkes tasted like square Tater Tots.)2. Service....aside from repeated water fill-ups....service was terrible. Setting down three of the four mains and leaving one patron an empty table for a few minutes......really?3. Price....very expensive....and I say that only because the meal was so boring. We have paid more for some wonderful meals (in Chicago and while traveling), and felt fairly priced due to the fabulous experience. The two of us ate for about $90 at Table, Donkey and Stick and felt cheated."
"I now know what the stick is for...i copied this from another yelp review.  I just don't get it.  Nothing special.  Food is complicated,tasty and expensive. Place is meager in a dumpy neighborhood.  Execution lacks professionalism.  With the zillions of choices, why go here?  Had a nice meal with great dining companions who are no foodier than me, but very into the restaurant scene.  Place seems busy (not slamed) on a Saturday night.  Friendly service trying to have you enjoy your experinece--again--not a bad place, but MEH is exactly right."
"Gifted a Travel Zoo special we ambled into this surprising storefront where street parking is still possible.   The chefs table sat us in front of co-owner Scott Manley where we could watch every step of preparation of a menu of food diverse, sensuous, flavored with more ingredients than I have had in my kitchen in my lifetime.  Go eat there."
"We had a post birthday party, party here with one of my good buddies.  Great food all made in house. The place is very intimate and you really get a feel of the small European kitchen vibe they have going on here. The 3 of us started with a their Wanderteller, we picked the smoked trout, duck pate, and the Point Reyes Toma cheese. The trout and cheese were fantastic. The pate was okay a little to lunch meat tasting.  We also orders some ham hocks which were just freakin amazing. Pork to the extreme and back. Well done. For the main course I ordered the Roast Goat which was excellent. Tender, juicy, and packed full of flavor. I was surprised how much I got as well a really nice portion.  The lady got the Alpine Burger the taste I got was burger heaven. They served it with a side of potato latkes which really stood out as something different and special.  The birthday boy got the pork sausage, and it too was great. Everything here had that made in house with love taste. And I will be back. Overall great food, nice service, and great atmosphere."
"Been eating all weekend in Chicago and unfortunately this has been our least favorite spot so far.  I found it by googling best new restaurants in Chicago.  To me the food was just ok.  It is not like the food was bad but compared to what we had been enjoying it was just kind of bland, nothing to get excited about.  We had the beef tartare, kohlrabi soup, pheasant, pretzel with cheese, and veal cheeks.  The pretzel was the best but who can mess up a pretzel?Here is a good way to put this place.  If you're into really plain tasting foods that taste exactly how they should when picked from Mother Earth, maybe this place will sit better with you."
"I found this restaurant through Yelp reviews and they didn't let me down! It was a last minute reservation because our original restaurant of choice had a water main break. Their misfortune worked out well for us. We started with the charcuterie and cheese, followed by small plates (poached egg with chicken livers, smoked salmon). The wine that was featured that day was also excellent and paired well. The atmosphere is fabulous. You wouldn't know it from the street but inside is a chic rustic space that smells of smokey deliciousness."
"Table, Donkey & Stick (TDS) was an interesting restaurant, but ultimately was somewhat forgettable.  What made the restaurant interesting was the cuisine, which they describe as ""rustic mountain fare.""  However, most of the dishes were just so-so.Decor: the front of the restaurant is lacking in character and charm.  The back has two large tables, placed close together, each of which would seat 12.  I definitely preferred the latter.Service: really disappointing.  Our server was straight from hipster casting, oversized glasses and all,  However, he lacked a personality, did not explain dishes or give any help with the menu, and ultimately behaved like we had woken him from a much needed nap.  In fairness it's also possible that a co-worker slipped him two Ambien before his shiftFood: If judged on food alone, the restaurant would merit a soft 3 stars (2.5, but rounded to 3 because of typical Yelp grade inflation).  We went with a party of 6 and tasted probably 3/4 of the menu.  The Wanderteller was meh, the starters were meh...nothing bad, but nothing memorable at all.  Of the mains, the burger was dry and tasteless, though the latkes served instead of fries were crisp and delicious.  The table thought the pork belly was fine - nothing more.  The  highlight of the meal was the braised goat loin, which was very tender.  But despite the complex preparations described on the menu, nothing made you say ""wow"" or exploded with flavor.  The desert was especially disappointing.  A blueberry cake was so dense and dry that it was difficult to put a fork through it.  The chocolate ravioli with beets sounded inventive, but was ultimately boring.  A beet reduction sauce, perhaps spiced with cinnamon, would have added interest to the dish.Overall, boring flavors and poor service.  Can't see coming back."
"A line around the corner for bang bang pie shop?! Ugh.  On my sad walk home, I passed a brunch sign at Table, Donkey, and Stick.  The restaurant was completely empty so I sat at the bar and talked with the bartender and host. Ordered the fried chicken (boneless thigh) with grilled kale, poached egg, gravy, and a biscuit.  Delicious.  I had to ask for a little more gravy but it was seasoned well and the portion was a great size.The bartender recommended I try the corned duck leg next time.  Will do.Great new brunch addition to the neighborhood (this is their first weekend of regular brunch service)."
"Way over rated. Very cute place,  tiny. Waited for our reservation for 25 min.  They are never on time so no big deal but you are shoved and pushed the whole time while waiting. No space to breath.  The tables are tiny and you have to be careful not to elbow your next table because there is no space between the tables. Food was  very good but overpriced. I am a fan of small portions tapas style but there are many better places in Chicago."
"I dined solo here last night for the first time, and really enjoyed everything about Table, Donkey and Stick. Quick tips: * Table, Donkey and Stick is an easy walk from the California blue line stop. (10-ish minutes) * There is no bar, so if you're flying solo, you're going to be alone at a two-seater. Not very conducive to meeting people, though maybe the patio would be nice for that. * Staff is very friendly and knowledgeable about the food and drinks. * I pretty much want to eat and drink everything on the menu. I was there on a Wednesday, and  it was burger night, which I believe is every Wednesday for the foreseeable future. This is a great deal ! You get a burger, a beer and bitters for $15. Basically you get the drinks for free. Naturally, that's what I ordered.Burger night details: * Alpine burger (bodensee butterkase, pretzel bun, onion marmalade) which is served with little mini latkes with horseradish aioli and apple mustarda. Why have no other restaurants considered the mini latke? So smart. So crispy and salty and potato-y and delicious. And the dipping sauces were so good. Burger was also really tasty, perfectly cooked. Good portion size. I probably could have stopped at half, but since I had the digestiv coming, well, I figured I should make it work. * Brewery Vivant Triomphe - a draft Belgian pale ale. I am typically more of an IPA fan in the summers, but this was a great beer, very well balanced and not overly ""Belgiany.""* Choice of three digestivs - the waiter explained each and I selected what he said is his favorite. I forget the name but it was the most bitter/intense of the three. It was quite strong, but if you like that kind of thing, I recommend it. Since it wasn't very busy when I was there, my waiter encouraged me to stay as long as I wanted when he brought me the check. Because they were so friendly and my bill was barely over $16 at this point, I ended up staying for another drink.  :) Almost ordered dessert, but I was stuffed."
"This review is for Wednesday Burger Night only!Well, it was amazing.  2 patties with some insane cheese on a pretzel bun served with mini-latkes.  And a beer and a shot of bitters for $15.Sold. I will be there every Wednesday for as long as they do this.Now I really need too try the rest of the food!  Great service, cute little patio, great gem in my neighborhood."
I enjoy the food that comes out of this kitchen. To critique every detail of my experience in a restaurant review is in my opinion trite and unnecessary. The menu is well executed the peeps who work here are cool. The wine on the menu goes good with the dishes. I do bring my friends and family here and I will be back.
Wish I could give 3.5 or 3.75! The only reason I am knocking off stars is the price point.The atmosphere is rustic meets modern which we were a fan of. Our server was really nice and attentive.The food we had was all good - don't le the other reviews fool you. We started out with their local greens and smoked sturgeon which were both good. If the smoked sturgeon were a larger portion I could eat that for dinner on a regular basis!For entrees we had the salmon and the duck - both which were great and good sized portions! The duck was very rich needless to say so keep that in mind.Cocktails were not spectacular and the food is definitely overpriced. In fact if it weren't so pricy I'd say we would be regulars here. It's worth a try but know you will likely drop a pretty penny.
"Ate here over the weekend and sat on their lovely patio. Had a great meal. Loved their small plates, the Indiana Shrimp was amazing. My boyfriend kept raving that the rabbit dish was fantastic and flavorful. Also he was worried from the online menus that he would be hungry after..not the case. They also  had a great sparkling wine and beer selection."
"The food at Table, Donkey, and Stick is inventive, hearty-but-not-greasy, and involved enough to feel ""fancy"" without being overly complicated. Their menus online seem to be a bit outdated, but I honestly feel like I could order anything here and leave happy. Favorites, however, were definitely the Wanderteller (specifically the veal brain, Schweinekopf, and smoked Whitefish), the smoked oyster plate (I live on a coast and didn't even realize oysters could be that big), and the pretzel with cauliflower-gruyere dip. And the desserts - oh my. Definitely not an afterthought. The ice creams with caramel corn chicharron all sounded so delicious that it was difficult to choose, and the blueberry basque cake was aesthetically gorgeous. The drink menu is nice here, too - not huge, but well-curated. There are some Chicago favorites like malört and a koval tasting flight, but also some selections that you won't find everywhere, like nice German smoked beer and inventive house cocktails like hot chocolate with chartreuse (I know it sounds questionable but I swear to you it was delicious). Don't get me wrong - Table, Donkey, and Stick was not totally perfect. The decor and service was, as others have said, definitely on the silly hipster side at times (the attentive and nice yet sloppily-plaid-shirted waitstaff,  the giant tree trunk hostess stand...).The bathroom is a little dingy relative to the rest of the place and located in a tiny hall where the kitchen and front and back dining rooms meet, making an interesting ""traffic"" situation. This could easily be a 4-star review, but it's a definite 5 for the value. Four of us got totally stuffed on food, had two drinks each, and the total came out around $160. Can't complain about that."
"Love the look of this place. Not a bad seat in the house from the windows where you can people watch, the bar where you watch the kitchen and bartenders do their thang, to the back more romantic area. Service is always great, attentive, and knowledgable. The food is wonderful too. Inventive cheese places with homemade products. I've been here several times...great neighborhood date place!"
"What a gem! Very hip ambiance, wonderful people work here and such a welcoming neighborhood spot. I highly recommend for both scenarios: just drinks or a thoughtfully prepared meal! You won't be disappointed."
"The things that made Table, Donkey and Stick stellar: 1. Staff, service, and ambiance were exceptional. Casual, friendly, yet very professional and attentive. My seat offered the best view of the kitchen, and I can see the team (only 3) working hard through out the night. A very calm and efficient kitchen I must say - and the view certainly added on to my dinner here. 2. Food was well executed. Very meat-heavy, but might have been what we ordered. We tried 3 wandertellers, 3 cheese, some small and large plates. Among the best were the Duck Liver Mousse, Schweinekopf, the Raw Cow cheese, the Robiola Rochetta cheese, the Bacon, and the sturgeon. The bacon was perhaps the best dish, followed by the mousse and schweinekoft. The cheese was amazing, and the fish was very good as well. 3. Sitting next to Rick Bayless and his wife, who were quietly and humbly enjoying their dinner there. He later complimented chef Manley on the food. Witnessing all of this just made me smile the whole night!So why not 5? Some of the dish was overwhelmed by a particular flavor. The turnip in sturgeon dish was a little too strong - I didn't mind it, but my date didn't like it. Same with the garlic on the snail small plate - too strong for me. Dinner took almost 3 hours, and the wait between the courses could have been a little less. Also, the acoustic was off - I was speaking really loud, yet my date couldn't hear a thing. I do really like it here though. Food wasn't cheap, but for the quality and even quantity it was fitting. Everyone should give this place a try! According to our waitress industry people come here often. Who will I see next?"
"What a hidden gem!  The food and cocktail programs at Table, Donkey and Stick are both fantastic and very impressive.  The menu is thoughtful, the ingredients are quality, and the food is outstanding.  I would recommend this restaurant to a friend, and I think it is definitely worth a trip down Armitage to try this restaurant."
"Table, Donkey and Stick has started opening for brunch. Went for the first time today and the brunch is just as wonderful as their dinners. I had a cast iron skillet three-egg dish with asparagus, latkes, chili sauce and more. It was perfectly prepared. My wife had a duck sausage dish which she also thoroughly enjoyed. Great tea, coffee, bloodies too. They have a tiny, tree-lined patio out back that's perfect on a nice summer day. Very warm and welcoming service and saw that they were dog-friendly with a little fence gate in the back and water bowl for fido. I hope more people discover this gem for brunch. Much more professionally-prepared, refined fare than you find at most brunch spots in Logan Square/Wicker Park/Bucktown."
"Warm and inviting atmosphere with knowledgeable and friendly staff.Fantastic charcuterie and cocktails. Menu was great from the smaller plates, to the entrees, which were all amazing. Looking forward to returning."
"Great food, great atmosphere at an off the beaten path.the place is really cute and laid back. They have this outdoor seating area with fire pit and also part of the back of the house has this retractable roof installed that i think it would make summer dining there really fun...even now that they had the roof closed up, and i felt like if we had a big group sitting in that area it would be like dining at someone's house in the alpine area. :)the food and drinks were excellent. Not salty like a lot of small plate sharing places, the ingredients were fresh and tasty. the bread came with our starter set was tasty! it was dense like the european style... love continental european style bread! Good sign this place is going to be great! :Pthe roasted bacon was lean enough that it felt like i am actually eating the european style bacon (yet you still know it's not pork loin :P ) ! i esp. like the pheasant galantine and the smoked vension loin from the starter. the pork dish my friend had was really good, but it was definitely on the heavier side.my friend ordered the pink lemonade that we were delightfully surprised that it wasn't pink, and i was proud that my taste bud picked up on the rose scent that we later found out it was the Fentimans rose lemonade...i am going to look to see where i can stock them at home!the only down side was that our server seems to be kinda lack of enthusiasm...not sure if he has had a long week and weekend since we came in on a sunday evening...but the rest of the service was excellent."
"Love love love this place.We held off on trying it for over a year after opening - and we live across the street. Oops! I'll be making up for that lapse in judgement over the coming summer season. We had been put off by what seemed to be a slightly pretentious menu, and didn't expect them to last very long this far west on Armitage... and then they got their liquor license, and then they started serving brunch... We started seeing people in jeans and t-shirts inside during the day, okay maybe this is the kind of place we can check out... and I'm so glad we did! In fact, we liked it so much we came right back the next night!The food was delicious, well-presented, and only a touch more expensive than I was hoping, though they do offer really good deals Mondays and after 9pm. We tried all manner of charcuterie and cheeses, as well as salads and smoked fish. Everything we ate tasted great!Between the two of us, we tried almost all the cocktails on the menu in our back-to-back nights, and were absolutely taken by all of them. As a non gin-drinker, let me tell you, I purchased and enjoyed TWO seasonal house G&Ts, and enjoyed a couple other drinks that pushed my comfort zone. (Are you familiar with a pickleback? I was not familiar with a pickleback.) John, the wonderful bar manager, has crafted a small, seasonal house cocktail list. We didn't venture out from there. We didn't need to.The only thing that could make me give this place a fifth star would be a bit more variety on the menu. The food is a bit salty and heavy, and the cocktails are floral and bright. They play off each other very well, but with such a small menu, you have to make sure you are in the mood for this restaurant, rather than going and finding something on the menu that you are in the mood for."
"A nice surprise, unique and interesting foodie find. We loved the cocktails and the wonderful greenhouse type dining room in the back. We did a trio of starters including the pig head, goat pastrami and the steak tartar. The pastrami was my favorite, the head is quite fatty, great flavor but less is more. The tartar looked great but perhaps ""a la minute"" preparation had not allowed flavors to set.   The cauliflower cheese with pretzel was AWESOME! So simple so perfect. The rabbit dish had great cold cured loin but the rabbit balls was gamey and gritty. Salads perfectly dressed the smoked chicken was wonderfully juicy but as the broccoli was as smokey as the chicken. A smoked/unsmoked contrast would have made the dish better. I coveted my neighbors burger at the table next to me. I will be back for that!"
"Update 2014: The bar is a great addition.  Be sure to try the picklebacks - they're made from the brine they use to pickle various things in-house.  E.g. smoked cippollini pickleback, - next-level gourmet shots.  Beer selection isn't Map Room-scale but is good and well-considered.  And the cocktail selection is worth the trip as well."
"Interesting... sat and looked at the menu and was at first not interested in eating any of it.  However, I'm always ready to try new things so we ordered: Duck liver mousse, Fatty fennel salami, Point Reyes Toma cheese (but they were out and was auto substituted to a Nufenen), roasted beets salad, Blood sausage with smoked oyster.Duck liver mousse - $6 - great presentation, great flavors, just awesome.Fatty fennel salami - $6 - less salami, more just fat and a little over salted.Nufenen - $6 - a wedge of cheese, nothing spectacular.Roasted beets salad - $10 - awesome plate of 2 styles of beets, excellent flavors.Blood sausage - $12 - the smoked oyster had a weird smell/taste to it... from being smoked... cube of blood sausage was just different; dish also included braised salsify, candy kumquats, mizuna, barley, and carway which gave this plate a wide variety of flavors and textures which all sort of went well together but was not that pleasurable.Very glad to have come here and try some new items.  Great presentation, all the dishes were very uniform like they were telling a story.  Can't say I would come again but glad to eaten here today.  Other items include (but not limited to): pheasant gallantine, cuanciale, schweinekoff, sea trout gravlax, swabian pretzel, crispy tripe, rabbit ballotine, smoked sturgeon... just so you know what your getting yourself into. :)"
We had brunch here today. We all agreed it was fabulous. Food was good. Drinks were good. Server was very nice (thank you Thea). I had the fried chicken and green tomato with a side of bacon.  Rest of table had smoked trout and bread pudding. Everything was very good. Wonderful patio area in back. You should go.
"On a cold and snowy night, my wife and I went to Table, Donkey and Stick for our anniversary dinner. Though a table wasn't ready for our reservation, we enjoyed two of their cocktails while huddling around their outdoor fire pit. A perfect way to set the mood for a meal at this noisy, cozy restaurant. We were seated at a communal table, and thoroughly annoyed with a party of eight women loudly celebrating their drunken boisterousness. All that noise disappeared when the food arrived. We had three of their charcuterie (duck, pheasant and pig face!). Good meat, my wife was amazed with the pheasant while I got to eat the pig face, and the amazing bread was a perfect pairing. We also had four of their small plates (sunchoke soup, pork shoulder with pig ear terrine, rabbit, and crispy tripe). The food is delicious and balanced, and for such hearty fare, everything was so balanced. Wonderful food, good service, and great drinks."
"What can I say about TDS? It is small, cramped and ""okay"". They have a nice patio with beautiful lighting but we sat inside at a community table. They were out of the wine we wanted & they brought us the wrong food. Minor details. The actual food was a bit too bland for me. I had the smoked chicken with poached egg. I personally wish it had more flavor- it was too simple."
Came for bunch a few times.   Bummed they do jut do brunch in the winter but overall the food was excellent.  Drinks were great.   Not over priced and the staff was very friendly - which is getting harder and harder to find!   Tried to come in for dinner but the place is small so always a wait.   I will be back fine Sunday's in spring.
What a lovely meal. Good idea to make a reservation. We did and were there before a crowd. Our waiter was so warm and suggested a great charcuterie plate. The small plates are perfectly sized to share and the entrees are not too large so you can't finish with a couple small plates. They told us about a great Sunday pre-fix menu that we will definitely return for.
"Table, Donkey and Stick occupies the space formerly known as Bonsoiree; Owner Shin Thompson is embarking on a new restaurant in the West Loop and is currently hosting a series of pop up dinners at Table, Donkey and Stick where several different chefs will have the chance to create their own menu and run the restaurant for a night. Shin hopes to name a winner by the end of November and have the restaurant open in December. The winner will be in charge of the kitchen as Shin will be focusing on his new West Loop venue. While Shin is permitting the chefs lots of flexibility during these pop up dinner, the overarching theme to Table, Donkey and Stick is to be reminiscent of the cuisine and ambiance that typifies what one would find at inns around the Alps in Southern France, Switzerland and Italy. The name comes from a Brothers Grimm fairy tale Each chef has a budget of how much they can spend on food ($750 per night not including staples), must include bread service with rillettes, have at least three additional courses and somehow reflect the traditions of the Alps. There is also an emphasis on whole animal butchery. The pop up dinners are offered at a reduced price of just $15 and seats announced on their Facebook page. Tonight was the first night of the competition and Chef Jon Keeley (former sous chef at Bonsoiree who has also worked at Blackbird as well as in Boston, MA at Toro) manned the kitchen. He delivered an outstanding five course meal; the food was complex, interesting, aromatic, flavorful and delicious. Tonight's courses included a hearty salad featuring elements such as poached trout, Mascarpone snow, sunchoke puree, beets.; this was really a fun, tasty salad. Next came a Charcuterie platter with homemade pretzel rolls, bacon-wrapped terrine, rillettes and pork sausage (the only thing missing here was some nice cheeses, but the terrine and pretzel bread were phenomenal).  This was followed by an heirloom squash soup with sweetbreads, chili oil and IPA foam; my least favorite course of the night but not bad by any means. My favorite course was the squid ink pappardelle with braised rabbit, rabbit loin, Brussels sprouts and toasted hazelnut crumble; interestingly this looked and tasted somewhat like a fancy, upscale tuna casserole (with the squid ink imparting a pleasant fishy aftertaste to the rabbit). Dessert consisted of olive oil cake, some potent creme fraiche ice cream, espresso gel, ganache and the most delicious honeycomb candy.The ambiance at Table, Donkey and Stick is quite nice other than that it can become loud when full; it is a cozy space with nice, decor trying to mimic an inn at the Alps. A very cool, unique feature is the  fire pit in the backyard where you can enjoy an after dinner cocktail around a bonfire; this was not yet operational but is supposed to be up and running by the second pop up dinner. Service was a bit off at times, but that is totally expected under the circumstances (opening night and brand new concept of a series of pop up dinners each with a different chef) - in the past Bonsoiree has always had stellar service so I do not foresee this as an issue once there is some stability. For now I am awarding a provisional four star ranking, but Table, Donkey and Stick has five star potential. It is still a complete work-in-progress as there will be several more chef auditions, each with it's own unique menu and style before a winner is selected and a regular menu developed. It will be very interesting to see how everything unfolds; be sure to follow them on Facebook as they are very active and provide lots of updates as well as information on upcoming pop up dinners if you want to partake."
"Unexpected combinations with mixed results; Chamomile & Cocoa Nib Salami and Point Reyes Toma Cheese made for a tasty bite. The Local Greens salad was overdressed in a sweet Honey Vinaigrette. Schnitzel was prepared well but Asian seasoning sort of ruined it and broccoli wasn't fresh. The Pork Shoulder Bacon was a solid choice. Be warned that the wine pours are offensively short, but the service is very friendly and attentive."
"So after reading other reviews for Table, Donkey and Stick I'm not sure if I have different tastes, but I really did not enjoy the food here.Most of the options were pretty bland and aside from a nice presentation they weren't very good.There were a couple bright spots in the Smoked Trout and the Schweinekopf Wandertellers. Both were very good and I loved the bread that comes with.The Small Plates:- Soft swabian pretzel, cauliflower-gruyere fondue, was pretty standard and un eventful. I like soft pretzels but expected something a little more from a restaurant like this.- Smoked Whitefish, was just not my type of dishLarge Plate:- Crepinette was extremely boring and somewhat disappointing. The meat was something that reminded me of deli sausage you can get from jewel. Unfortunately I would probably not return."
"This place was fine. Nice ambience, cozy with a small patio in the back. Unfortunately none of the food really stuck with me and I ate there just four days ago. Overall was a bit overpriced for what it was (very small portions, and again nothing standout). Overall I would suggest stopping by for a snack and one of their $5, tasty cocktail of the day, but don't rely on it for dinner!"
"Went here for the NYE six course tasting menu. They were flexible when we were late secondary to weather, all of the staff were talkative, warm, and inviting but not overbearing. I liked the decor, though it was a little chilly to sit near the front windows. I want to go back to check out the cute outdoor back area in the summer for sure.And, the food. Overall, each dish was subtle yet inventive. There were a few clear standouts for me... The venison ham at the very start, the rabbit with rabbit bacon and sunchoke, and the olive oil cake!!! The cocktails were all delicious as well. There is some great talent and attention to detail happening in this unassuming place... I am a fan! Maybe they will get my last star next time.The entire experience was very nice, warm and homey despite being a little more upscale than a normal night out. I will be going back."
"I love this place!  I didn't see a donkey, but the tables were beautiful and the place was made of gorgeous sticks.  But the thing that really made me happy was the food and service.  Our service was outstanding - the friendliest staff and the warmest reception.  The food was excellent.  We came on Monday night, when they offer a burger special featuring their handmade burgers and homemade bread.  It is delicious!  The atmosphere is also worth mentioning - it is delightfully rustic, with a Vermont charm.  Check it out!"
"My friend and I ended up here by chance when we were quoted an hour-plus wait at a nearby restaurant.   I'm so glad that we tried Table, Donkey and Stick!  It's in the same place that Bonsoiree used to be, but they built a cozy addition out back which has two long communal tables and a fire place - very cute!  I'm still not completely sold on communal table but understand why restaurants like the concept.  The table was a little uncomfortable in that I have longer legs and could not cross them as there wasn't enough space for my knees to not hit the table.Service was great!  The menu was hard to figure out in terms of how much to order and our waiter perfectly advised us, and the dishes were well-spaced.My friend and I decided to share a variety of small plates.  We started with a cheese plate and Wanderteller (house-made meats) plates.  The cheeses were great, but the Wanderteller were more unique.  Loved the Caramel Corn Chicharron, which if you don't order as a starter, shows up again on the dessert menu.  It tasted exactly like caramel corn.  The Schweinekopf was my least favorite dish of the evening as it tasted a lot like corned beef.For entrees, we again split small plates, namely the pork fat pretzel, the polenta and latkes.  My favorite was the polenta - it was delicious!  The pretzel was tasty, but tasted no different than a German pretzel without pork fat.  And the latke, while small, were incredibly tasty.The beer menu was small but diverse.  Price-wise, it was very reasonable as the above food along with two beers was about $40 per person.I highly recommend you check out Table, Donkey a Stick, a welcome addition to a neighborhood that is quickly becoming a food destination!"
"Good food, great service! The frog legs and duck were outstanding! Very small and cute restaurant, great for a date and the patio is nice."
"Had lovely dinner here for a friends birthday. We were lucky enough to have gone on the Sunday BBQ Special that was put together by the chef from local fave Trencherman. All 6 of us had the smoked brisket with a salad topped with shaved radishes & green onion in a very light vinaigrette, asparagus & a pillowy soft corn cake with a pickled jalapeno aioloi. A perfectly portioned plate of deliciousness! All of our cocktails were wonderful. The desserts were out of this world! The cocoa & malted milk donut holes were served hot & were crispy on the outside & fluffy inside. The orange rhubarb ice cream was refreshing & the ice cream pie reminded all of us of those super cramy frozen Jello pudding pops of our youth & the pecan pie ice cream with caramel glazed chicharones were a fantastic surprise joy of the evening.Service was enjoyable-attentive but not hovering. Water glasses were always full, empty plates cleared quickly. Servers were super knowledgeable about the dishes & gave great suggestions on cocktail/beer pairings.Will definitely be back-esp for their Monday evening $5 specials."
"We went to TDS for a friend's going away party with a party of about 10-13 friends last evening and the night was so awful it was comical. We had a 7pm reservation, so they had a table ready for us in their beautiful glass patio with an open roof. We enjoyed drinks at the bar for a bit waiting for everyone to arrive and were seated about 7:30 but that is where the night turned its corner. We didn't have our drink order taken until 8:15. And that would be the first and only opportunity to order a drink for the night. We didn't order until 8:30, after sitting there for an hour. To be clear, this was not our group chatting and not being ready. In the server's defense, he was swamped and completely in the weeds. He kept coming to our table to tell us what he needed to do, then he would come back ""and be all ours."" But we kept watching him assist other tables for 45 minutes, before finally discussing the menu and taking our drink order. His updates were frustrating because they never transpired to the service he promised.We ordered the price fix option they offer on Sunday evenings for $22, which is a GREAT value. They offered 3 courses, with 3-4 options for each course. They offered 4 entree choices (1 veg, 3 meat), one of which was a burger. Five people at the table ordered the burger offered. However, 20 minutes after ordering it (and after 1.5 hrs of being at the table) the server came back and said they were out. Huge bummer. And one more delay for the evening.30 minutes after ordering our first course came out. I had a cheese option and my boyfriend had the pork loin. Both were fantastic and full of flavor. The pork loin had a bit of spice at the end and was shaved perfectly thin. Another 30 minutes pass and our salad course arrives. Again, the food was fantastic. I had the beet borscht. Incredible. One of my favorite chilled appetizers I have ever had. The beets were cooked perfectly and not mushy. This was my favorite dish of the night.Annnnnnoooother 30 minutes pass after our plates have been cleared and our entrees arrive. Again, the food was innovative and deliciously full of flavor. The vegetables were perfectly roasted and highlighted the chicken. My boyfriend had a smoked corn with his walleye and it was another highlight of the evening. I had the chicken ballotine and my boyfriend had the pike walleye. However, the menu mentioned an oat dumpling which was not with any of our chicken entrees. My papardelle was over cooked and stuck together, making it an inedible pile of pasta mush, which I mentioned to the server and he just brushed off. Additionally, my boyfriend had a large fish bone in his walleye. However, we were so hungry at this point and frustrated by the service, it was just another par for the course for our 3 hour dinner.The 3 hours wouldn't have been as painful as they were if the server came and checked in so we could order more drinks, etc. But instead we sat there with empty glasses as we watched him run around. Again, he was busy and in the weeds but come on.....1 drink for a 3 hour meal?!? The food was as good as I heard, however HUGE negative points for some of the worst service I had in a while, the overcooked pasta, and bone in the fish. The restaurant needs to hire more servers and/or kitchen staff or whatever it takes to work out the service kinks. Not sure what the problem was but can't say that I will be back."
"This place is always a ""go-to"" for guests in town and when wanting a change of pace.  We love the staff and the new redesign, is great!"
Wonderful food. Small and quaint atmosphere. We were seated a table right along the open windows in the summer- try to snag those. Good people watching.
"This is a lovely place!  The food is delicious, interesting, and made with quality ingredients. The atmosphere is friendly and relaxed. The staff is friendly. Highly recommend!"
"My wife and I stopped in here for a drink one Saturday evening and immediately fell in love.  The bar is super inviting, well thought out, and executed.  The drinks were well balanced, strong, and at the correct price point for the neighborhood.  The barkeeps were very friendly and provided for good conversation.  We were coming from dinner so we could not try the food, but damn did the pretzel looked great.  I would highly recommend TDS as a nice, quiet, and thoughtful place to go for an evening."
"Table, Donkey and Stick is a different, fun experience. It's in a nondescript little building expanded with a greenhouse-type addition. We sat in that rear dining area which can get a little loud (if they have a lot of customers who don't know how to moderate their voices in public). Our table started out wobbly which was soon rectified. The It's A Wash and LGN Blvd cocktails were great but kind of small. We did the Wanderteller with the pheasant, the duck liver mouse, and the duck country pate, all delicious. To me the rye baguette was not really complementary to these. We went on to the crispy tripe (a little oily but fun to check out), the duck nduja sausage (more like a spicy pudding in a casing, and we'd never had pickled duck's tongues before!), and braised rabbit (topped with a dollop of ""olive oil pudding""). For entrees we tried roasted goat (which, along with its delicious spaetzle, was kind of dominated by a rather large slice of acorn squash), and the roasted sweet potato with kale puree, which completely demonstrated how an artfully prepared vegetarian dish can rise to any lusty heights that a carnivorean one can. We had to see what they did with desserts: the beet cheesecake with pear ice cream was curious as well, not entirely successful, but it was cool that they tried. We enjoyed T,D and S because they are really pushing the envelope in what's possible with basic food; each dish was thoughtfully composed, with particular attention to textures. While in the end (my wife disagrees) they didn't really hit it from a deliciousness standpoint (actually, some of the dishes are almost a chore to get through), at least we got to try some unique and special combinations and ingredients. Comparing to another $200 dinner earlier in the week, we felt like we got a lot more bang for the buck here. Although the money ingredients are meagerly portioned, the accoutrements satisfy you such that you never feel deprived; in fact in the end you feel generosity."
"I definitely dig this place, the old Bonsoiree spot.  From the buckwheat baguette with delicious (lardy) butter to the whimsical fairy tale of a decor, Table offers a really unique take on the Alpine foods.  I enjoyed the menu because it was different! We ordered artisan cheese plate, eggplant and thyme, local lettuce salad, sunchockes and squash (never knew what sunchokes were before Table!), trout and buckwheat pasta!  Everything was delicious.  ...and i totally love the name!!!  Super cool!  I have written a more detailed review of Table, Donkey and Stick in my blog with pictures and all, check it out if you're interested: thetravelingfoodster.com…"
"My GF took me here for a surprise birthday dinner, and I could not have been happier with the choice.  If you are a fan of unusual meats (Pheasant Gallantine, beef Tongue  etc)  you will definitely enjoy this place.  The food is definitely unusual compared to the normal new trendy places opening up.  Very Logan Square.The service was phenomenal (we didn't realize it until we paid, but they comped us an 18 dollar beer after the table of drunk broads on girls night out shattered a glass of red wine on my foot and didn't apologize).  Our server had soda water out to our table before I could even wipe my foot. On top of that, he was incredibly knowledgable about the menu, and provided great recommendations.  He had an impressive beard, and I highly recommend asking for him next time you are there."
"I hadn't heard much about Table Donkey and Stick, but it was getting pretty good reviews so I decided to check it out. The name is pretty silly and doesn't really make me want to eat there, honestly. At least it's memorable though, I guess.The food was disappointing. Not bad, but not good. I wouldn't go back again for the food, definitely not. The other tables that were seated near us were also very very very loud and seemed to know a lot of the wait staff personally. It reflected poorly on the staff. The cocktails were very good. If you're just going somewhere for a drink and maybe a snack, Table, Donkey and Stick would be fine."
"Love this place! We started the evening with a drink at the fire pit in the back - a really nice change of pace and so much fun. Dinner was amazing - such delicious and innovative dishes. For sure try the sweet potato soup & the chickpea cabbage roll - both were amazing! I also tried the celery based dessert - I was not sure what to expect ... but the chef really transformed the celery into something unexpected, sweet, and so good."
"TDS is about as good as it gets for fresh, local, foodie food -- particularly if you are an advocate of ""snout to tail"" eating. But I can tell you, as someone who eats no part of any pig, that you will enjoy a meal here even if you're 100% veggie.Particular recent favorites are a spring vegetable salad (ingredients vary by day!), a succulent whole roasted trout, goose liver pate from the wanderteller list, and the crispy, fresh baguettes paired with any part of the meal.I liked my first meal here so much I found an excuse to come back three weeks later. It's that good -- and worth a trip from outside the neighborhood.Other reviews don't seem to note this, so I want to add that this is a terrific place for a romantic date. The dining spaces are cozy, and in summer you can eat on the leafy back patio.About that ""cozy"" thing... this is a small restaurant. I think a few of the complaining reviews have in mind that every restaurant should always have extra tables, a belly-up bar, and endless line chefs chainsawing endless sides of beef to get dishes out to tables in 15 minutes. This is a real kitchen serving real food, with a real chef to prepare your meal. This means that they can run out of menu items late in the evening, or run out of seats if there is unexpected walk-up traffic. If you can't deal with this, I recommend Googling ""Lettuce Entertain You"".But if you want an impressive dinner that impresses your date or your guests, come here."
"This was, by far, the best dinner in recent memory. From house-made soda, to skillfully crafted cocktails, to delectable entrees (pork for me, burger for him), to a divine desert (Goat milk panna cota) - the whole experience was unforgettable. The service deserves its own praise - every single staff person was so genuinely welcoming, polite, and happy to be there. T, D & D is our new go to 'fancy"" dinner place and I'm sure that every guest and visitor will be taken here and no where else for the foreseeable future."
"Cute patio, deliciously fresh food, not a fan of the duck liver, salmon & chicken are great. Wine on draft is perfection. Wish they played something besides jay-z all night"
"Highly recommended for delicious Alps inspired cuisine with exceptional service in a relaxing, relational environment. Environment with delightful contrasts--The small space enhanced our experience and provided a disarming friendliness. It was small and yet big. A massive tree trunk is repurposed as a 4-foot tall hospitably angled host table below a real axe framed in glowing light. The partially shaded back patio (with a surprisingly open view of the sky above) sits comfortably next to a glass enclosed elevated communal dining room. It appreciates its size and residential location and successfully adds comfort, craftsmanship and an almost pastoral openness. We felt a sense of honesty and transparency that was refreshing.Delicious meal--Thoroughly excellent menu with uncomplicated, but lovely plating and mouthwatering options for the charcuterie and cheese set. The restaurant has a good relationship with Chicago's fine, and sometimes hard to find, Pipeworks brewery. We had a well paired beer selection from several options and also would recommend their cocktails. The wine list looks excellent as well.Quality service--Distinctly, thanks to the outstanding service of our server Steven and team, we consider Table, Donkey & Stick without a doubt one of the neighborhood's finest restaurants and perhaps a favorite in Chicago. Excellent speed and service. Steven was personable and conversational in just the right proportion.We already have our next visit planned."
"We called about popping into T, D, & S early on a random night, maybe a Thursday and they were great about welcoming us right in.  We used to live a block away from here and we went when it was Bonsoiree, but I'm actually really glad that it has made the change to T, D, & S as it fits the neighborhood better.  Don't get me wrong, I thought Bonsoiree was great, but it was a gastronomic experience and the price point was high for the neighborhood.  This place fits the neighborhood very well and I hope it's around for the long haul.  We started with the pretzel and cheese platter along with a salad that had goat cheese, fresh greens, and beets.  All of the flavors were spot-on and primed us well for dinner.  For mains, Adam got a burger and I got the fish of the day.  Adam said that the burger was one of the best burgers he has had in Chicago, although not as good as Owen & Engine, and I thought that the fish was great.  I still think that my favorite fish preparation is the parchment fish at Rustica in Kalamazoo, MI... as random as that is.  Either way, we really enjoyed our meal and we will definitely go back to try their desserts as we were too full from the starters and mains.  The food was thoughtful and creative without charging the prices that you'd see in other parts of the city.  The staff was helpful and friendly and I think that Table, Donkey, & Stick is a nice addition to the Southeast corner of Logan Square, along with Bang Bang Pie Shop.  Welcome and well done!"
Reviewing Wed. Night Burger Special which is amazing. What a deal for a gourmet burger in the city! Also includes a tall cool brew. Then wash it all down with some bitters. These are a few of my favorite things! I was thoroughly impressed. Not sure about the rest of the offerings. Had the frog legs too and was disappointed in the portion. But that was kind of expected with such a worthwhile deal over shadowing pretty much anything else on the menu.
"Great gem in the neighbor hood , beet salad and salmon were delicious with great flavor. Staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable."
"We walked in for a 930 res, and were led to our spot within 5 minutes. However, they sat us between two parties of four at 10 person communal table in the back. A guest begins to engage me in conversation and feels the need to smugly comment on my choice of attire and asks why everyone is wearing checkered shirts these days.  Ain't nobody got time for dat! We got up and asked to be moved to a private table, eo we waited 10 min for a 2 top to open up. So we are seated, and drinking reasonably priced cab, and order some wanderteller, and man was it succulent. 2 words: HEAD CHEESE. You better get some of that. Never had it before, and frankly, the thought of it is kinda nasty. But damn was it DELICIOUS. Pork rilletes? FORGET ABOUT IT. Schweinekopf? DAMN RIGHT SON.The small plates and entrees were solid, but the cured meats are the real winner here. TL;DR: Get the cured meat, beware communal tables if that isnt your thing"
"The other stuff seemed OK, but lord these people cannot cook a cheeseburger. Both I and a companion at my table ordered them medium rare as recommended, and mine was served as what I can only describe as black and grey- totally, totally, ridiculously over cooked. My companion's was almost as bad. I think the problem is they are trying to use pattys that are so small in diameter (much smaller than the bun, giving you the ""where's the beef"" effect) and thin that they are done before the cooks realize what is going on. I returned it and it came back as well done(again missing medium rare by a mile), with a little bit of pink visible in the grey, but it's clear they are really struggling to master basic cooking skills. They could learn a lot from a line cook at Five Guys.They also forgot my drink order, despite being nearly empty."
"The last time we went to Table, Donkey and Stick was immediately after it opened, so we weren't sure what to expect. But we really loved everything. To start, we had the cured pork loin (delicious, but wish there were more than 3 pieces), duck liver mousse, and the pork rilletes  All were great and I can't wait to try the other wanderteller (s?).  For the main course, I had the alpine burger, which was good. I especially liked the latkes. My husband had the smoked chicken sandwich, which I really liked even though I normally am not a huge fan of chicken.  For dessert, we split the caramel corn chicharron with strawberry ice cream, which was one of the best desserts I'd had in a long time. I was about to get the bacon and eggs ice cream but my husband talked me into a more ""conventional"" flavor. We are very excited to go back."
"Really really delicious. I live extremely close to this place and was excited to give it a shot (once I figured out where it was, they could use a better sign).  We went over early (6ish) without a reservation and were seated right away. We tried the pheasant with one of the cheeses, the local greens salad, the burger and the smoked chicken sandwich.  Everything was excellent. We took the staff's suggestions on the meat and cheese and were not disappointed! Loved the service and the vibe at this place. The building itself is a little awkward but they are doing what they can with the space. I can't wait to go again and try out the back patio."
"Totally loved Table, Donkey and Stick. Their service is some of the best around...super friendly staff!Their duck liver pate was divine. Their meat & cheese platters were delicious. I loved the pretzel's cauliflower sauce...it was light, rather than the usual heavy fondue. Fantastic salads. The trout was delicious. Great beer selection. Desserts were great too. Oh, and I loved the patio...with blankets if it gets chilly. I'd definitely recommend it."
"Fred and his brother, ""Donkey"" walk into a pub and Fred gets the first pint in and says, ""I'll have a pint for me and a pint for Donkey.""The two guys drink their pints and Fred says, ""All right Donkey, your round; I'll have a pint of Guinness.""Donkey walks up to the bar and says, ""2 p p p p pints of g g g g Guinness p p p please.""While donkey gets the pints, Fred goes to the toilet and the barman says, ""Say, you shouldn't let him call you that stupid nickname.""Donkey replies, ""I know. He aw.. he aww... he awwwwww, he always calls me 'Donkey.'"" All horrible jokes aside, this was the best restaurant I've been to in 2013.  I've not been good about Yelping lately, but this place has brought me out of my shell.  Have you even shared dishes with others at the table, and everybody loved every dish???  That happened here.  Feel free to try the Wanderteller apps and share them.  We had the whitefish, beef tatar, and schweinknopf (better you not know).  All were great and perfect portions to share among three people.  From there we moved on to some frog legs, a summer squash entree, a golden trout dish, and a couple salads.  Portions are perfect for sharing and the food has a lighter European feel.  Almost more Scandinavian inspired than German, at least from what I've experienced.  The beer/drink/wine list is not too large, but by no means would I call it small.  They have some great international, and domestic drafts.  Our favorite was Oskar Blues Pils from Colorado, but they also had a Austrian Weisse beer that was excellent.  I also had their version of a Manhattan, and it was excellent.  For dessert we moved on to some finely prepared in house ice cream with a little house made pork rind that really worked well together.  We even shared a little Chartreuse.  The decor inside is nice, simple, and rustic.  We sat outside on their delightful little patio and the noise level was perfect for us to have our own conversation.  Our waiter John, was also excellent and he was able to explain every dish and drink very well.  You can tell he cares about Table, Donkey and Stick and it was refreshing."
"I really got in to this place..A friend and I ended up here because we once again did not want to wait at Fat Rice for more than an hour..and I'm glad that we did.  We called ahead and were told that they could seat us when we arrived but that we would have to be out by a certain time in order to accommodate a party with prior reservations.This restaurant is in the former Boinsoiree space but it is completely different.  The front hasn't changed much, but the folks at Table, Donkey and Stick have created a beautiful atrium in the back with communal tables.  My friend and I sat across from each other at one of these communal tables and while we were packed in tight, the food was worth it.The service was efficient and pleasant.  Our server had some great recommendations.  My favorite dish of the evening was the caramel corn chicharron -- delicious flavor and a great dish to share.  We also did the Schweinekopf which I liked because it had a corned beef taste and texture, but my friend wasn't in to it.We also ordered the pork fat pretzel, the latkes and the polenta.  The latkes were outstanding -- really flavorful.  The pretzel was so-so  -- definitely nothing to write home about.  I wasn't as wild about the polenta as my friend.Overall, I found Table Donkey and Stick to be a delicious and rather affordable option in the hip and restaurant-filled Logan Square area.  I'm definitely going to try it again!"
"Our fantastic server, Steven, helped us pick out some great items last night as neither of knew much about Alpine food. We shared the pretzel with cauliflower/gruyere fondue, spring vegetable salad, fried livers, pork crepinette, and the sunchoke cookie for dessert. All were delicious. The Jungfrau cocktail was incredible--I'll be craving that for a while. Wines by the glass were very reasonably priced."
"I gotta say, this place was pretty bad. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the drinks were on point. Of the main dishes we got the turkey, goat and the server initially brought out the wrong plate (pork shoulder and told us it was the goat) so we got that too. None were good. The goat was super charred, all the meats tasted waaaay too salty, and I won't even get into what ever else was on the plate with the turkey because 1, I don't know what it was supposed to be and 2, it is no longer on the menu so I cannot give an accurate description of what it was trying to be. Even with the free entree, we left probably half our food. Maybe they were having an off night because the couple next to us also looked very put-off by their dinner. I am not a picky eater, and this is probably only the second meal in the past year that I literally couldn't force myself to eat. If you're looking for a much better upscale small plate restaurant head to Black Bull (more tapas, less European) or The Publican (if you want to get meat plates that actually taste good and are worth the price)."
"This is officially my favorite restaurant. The food is always surprising, but not the kind of food you have to eat with tweezers or pop to release a dusty air mixture of cotton candy smell. The staff is attentive and they have personalities and seem to like working there. But they aren't all up on your jock interrupting your conversations.Chef Scott Manley, is kind and personable, his dishes are thoughtful, and if I found myself being the kind of person that never cooked and had the kind of money to eat out every time I wanted to eat, I would eat all of his foods. That said, it doesn't take a lot of money to eat here. No matter what I order, for two people, it always seems to add up to $50. This is a cocktail or beer, plus a pretzel (usually) and two main courses and a flight of bitters. Roughly $50 every time. Maybe their computer isn't good at math. They should check that out.And who knew bitters would become one of my favorite alcoholic beverages? I am going to craft some myself. And I want those tiny glasses. They're adorable.I need to restate: I have eaten at many places in this city. I have loved and do love many, but I have never encountered such a fantastic staff at a restaurant. I don't know where Scott Manley found these people, but I am grateful he did."
"Absolutely stellar food,  great atmosphere,  and great service.  All plates were fantastic: rabbit terrine,  smoked venison, polenta with bacon,  pork sausage,  and veal breast.  The bacon (with the polenta) is likely the best bacon I've ever had: smokey, sweet,  and so slow cooked the fat dissolved in your mouth.  The same applies to the venison: the slow cook process made it incredibly tender. For the price,  the food is unparalleled. I'll go back next time I'm in the city. I highly recommend it. Only issue with the service was asking then clearing the tip while we were still seated. It's much classier to wait until we leave."
"I was excited to try this place because I was a huge fan of Bonsoiree. A friend of mine also gave it rave reviews when she spent NYE here. So I'll start off with the not so good things....I purchased a Gilt offer and was disappointed that you had to order off of a special ""Gilt"" menu, which wasn't mentioned in the offer. That meant that I couldn't try some of the menu items that were getting rave reviews (like the smoked salmon). One item that should be taken off the menu immediately is the snail beet soup. I love beets and I really like snails (if they're prepared correctly) and this dish was just awful. Tiny little shriveled snails in a red beet soup is not appetizing at all.Their drink menu is also in desperate need of an update. I asked the waitress whether I should order brandy because it's actually mentioned in their slogan ""Crusty bread, brandy and fire"" and she couldn't even explain to me what brandy is or how it's important to the restaurant. The wine list and cocktail menu is pretty lacking as well. Now the good things...We definitely left the restaurant  full and satisfied with all of the courses that the offer came with. If you go, you definitely must order the Wanderteller Duck Liver Mousse, sooo delicious! The bacon small plate was also great and so were the tri-tip and sturgeon entrees. One of the best things about this place is that they actually serve their bread hot out of the oven. I know this seems like a small thing, but there is nothing better than warm fresh bread being served with a cheese plate. So on that, T,D&S definitely delivered!"
"I went for brunch and loved the wonderful back patio, service, and drink menu. I'm excited to go back and try the food for brunch or dinner."
"We had a Bonsoiree gift certificate to use and noticed they were now calling themselves TD&S.  Thankfully, they still accept the certs.  We called on a Saturday night on a whim and were told they were booked for the next two weeks.  Whoa.  They called us back 10 min later and said someone cancelled - we were impressed with the waiting list and call back so we were intrigued.We started off with the ""wanderteller"" (meats) and tried the Schweinekopf (pig face, but seriously delicious) and smoked venison.  We also tried 2 really good cheeses.For the small plates, we tried the salmon (amazing), polenta, and sausage.  We were a little disappointed that the poached egg on one of the dishes was cooked all the way through.  What's the point?!For the larges, we tried the sturgeon and the veal.  Both great, though I liked the veal better.  It was so tender, melt in your mouth, which I didn't expect.At this point our waiter disappeared.  Not sure what happened.  The table next to us actually sat down, waited for a bit, then walked out.  It was strange.  Finally the host came over and we just asked for some coffee and the check.  -1 starIn all, it was very good and we liked trying something different (they told us they were considered ""alpine"" food - german / austrian / northern italy / etc.)I really didn't understand the name until I read this: ""Table, Donkey and Stick is named for a Brothers Grimm tale in which one of three brothers earns a table that magically sets itself with rustic delicacies.""  So just fyi if you're wondering...67/365"
