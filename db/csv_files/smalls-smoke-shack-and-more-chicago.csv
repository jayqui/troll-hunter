"Smalls, Smoke Shack & More"
"I have been going to smalls since they opened, I have to say it is still serving up high quality food. The service is awesome, whether visit makes you feel like they value you and want to make you feel good.I highly recommend smalls and will keep feeding them my bussiness for years to come."
"Ridiculously overpriced fare.$16 for carryout for one person, which was brisket. That's pretty damn expensive in my book for the lean portions. The actual meat was tasty as well as the sauces (they provide two different sauces). However, just for comparison analysis I can go over to Smoque not that far away and get a full rack of babyback with two sides for $24 enough to feed two people."
"This place was really quite good.  Good BBQ with some Asian accents.  I like how they leave the tip on the rib; I'm always a fan when places do that.  The ribs are smoked/bbqed well, good flavor with a nice char with that nice pink layer right under the surface (BBQ heads will know what I'm talking about).  The brisket is quite good as well, and I'm not even a huge bbq brisket person (sorry Texas).  I REALLY dug the fried chicken, some of the best I've had in Chicago.  The reviews here are spot on; great crunch and not greasy.  There were only two noticeable flaws. First, the Filipino pork special was good, but not the pork part!  The pork was basically strips of pure pork fat, with no real meat.  Not a fan.  Second, they were out of some of their popular items.  Not a huge blunder of course, but proper resource planning is key to getting up to five stars.  Otherwise, it was great and I'd definitely return."
"Smalls has been on my list of places to try since I moved to Chicago and it now goes on that much shorter list of places that I am embarrassed not to have tried sooner.  This place is a powerhouse.One of the reasons it took me so long to try Smalls (aside from the fact that they close on the early side and are about four miles inland from my house) is that I couldn't really figure out what the deal was -- were they a Korean restaurant?  A barbeque restaurant?  A fried chicken restaurant?  After a visit, I now understand that the answer is ""all three"" and that their secret is that these are three different classes of food that have been yearning to be fused into one.Their bibimbap platter with smoked brisket is amazing.  The smoky flavor of the beef is beautifully set off by the spicy sauces and pickled vegetables.  And to avoid ruining the textures, they actually just lay all of the ingredients out in giant stripes on a tray, so you can combine them at your leisure.  We also tried sides of long beans (delicious) and fried beets (who knew you could fry beets?), which further rounded out the meal.  If you got the smoked tofu variation of the platter, this might be one of the best vegetarian meals in Chicago.(We also tried the fried chicken, which was honestly merely okay.  The spices in the coating were nice, but the problem is that even fast-food-chain-restaurant fried chicken is really good, so it's really hard for any restaurant to establish any noticeable superiority.)We were more than happy to call it a night at this point, but one of the staff (or maybe the chef?) happened to be photographing a plate of their new ""rib tip special.""  When he was done, he told us that it wasn't fair to plate it in front of us without letting us try it, so he gave it to us!  That special turned out to be my favorite of the dishes -- spicy cuts of meat covered with pickled cauliflower and jalapenos, needlessly piled on top of a bed of french fries, rendered extra-delicious by the spices.  We took home a very large box.Even leaving aside the extremely generous and cheerful service, this was an overwhelmingly satisfying meal.  Everybody knows that smoked meats are great.  This is the secret of barbeque.  But it turns out that ""smoked meats plus korean vegetable sides"" are WAY better than ""smoked meats plus southern sides.""  Barbeque is complemented with sour and salty vegetables so much better than by cheesy noodles or sweet beans or cabbage with mayonnaise. A restaurant and a new cuisine, all in one."
The food is fantastic. Very creative menu. Solid bbq. I need to eat here more often. I love the sauces which are home made. The meat has a nice smoky flavor. Fresh cut fries. Nothing more to say. You gotta go.
"First visit-- I found Smalls an interesting place- I came at the end of their rush. I tried to order on the phone in advance since I really hate to wait for to go orders- but it went straight to a recorded message- I found it wacky they have a 312 phone number but are in the 773 zone..but I guess phone rules have changed.The reason it went to the recorded message, they were so busy taking phone orders, and that is their set up-if they are on the phone, you get a pre recorded message.  So, I had to wait 20 mins for my order. I ordered Fried Chicken. By the time I got home- the chicken was still hot- the french fries not as much, they were going limp..and I thought just average. The chicken was decent enough, I think next time I will try the brisket or ribs.  The banana ketchup came with the order, it tasted like regular Heinz Ketchup to me- maybe a little better, Nothing crazy good.The staff was super friendly and the cook, maybe he was the owner, made a point of thanking me by name for waiting. You gotta love that. I did."
"Wee tiny restaurant, with big flavors and generous personality.My favorite thing was the beets with the spicy dipping sauce; my second-favorite thing was the beets with no sauce.  I have tried a lot of beet dishes in my time and have found a small handful others which were just as good, but none that were better.  And at Smalls, the preparation is totally unique.  These are going to rank really high on my beet list.The pickles were pretty mild; I would love to see them amp up the flavor on those.  And the pulled pork was a bit bland and not really pulled so much as chunked.  Also, it was supposed to come with a mustard bacon sauce which sounded right up my alley, but it didn't taste anything like mustard or bacon; it was more earthy and vinegary, sort of like soy.  Anyway, the sauce was just okay on the pork but worked much better when mixed into the garlic rice.The fries have a nice seasoning on their own, but the glorious banana ketchup makes them superb.  These guys should sell their recipe to Heinz for twelvity million dollars.Finally, the fried chicken was hot hot hot--let it sit for a few minutes because you are getting it fresh from the oil.  I really liked the chicken but it did need a little help from the banana ketchup to reach its full potential; in other words, it is a little bland on its own, but expertly cooked, not to mention quite large.I wanted to love the food as much as the awesome, gregarious staff pumped me up for it.  And to be sure, it was all good, but only the beets and fries were great.  Still, Smalls is a gem worth travelling to try.PS.  You will come home smelling strongly of wood smoke, and that is a-okay in my book."
"Well, they weren't kidding when they names this place. Smalls be small. Only a couple of seats, but most of the service seemed to be takeout anyway. The biggest area in the place is the kitchen, where staff milled around and called to customers with a jolly attitude.I got the fried chicken, which was excellent, and finger-licking good (oh wait...). Tender with a salt-and-peppery crust. You will need lots of napkins to eat this. (Or at least I did.)The garlic rice wasn't great, honestly. It was rather hard and tasted like old rice that had been resurrected from the dead by a brief whirl in the pan.Texas toast wasn't toasty, just sort of chewy, which was a weird experience for store-bought bread.My friend got brisket but didn't rave about it.The big draw here for me would be the chicken, followed by the exceedingly friendly service. There are other items on the menu to try, but it's a crap shoot whether you will be able to ""dine in"" (and we don't live nearby so we would be eating in the car...can't imagine doing that with the messy chicken!) It's up to you to decide how much inconvenience you're willing to put up with."
"FINALLY we made it over!Everything was perfection. Service. Food. But in particular, service. I think first impressions go a LONG way and Cassie? Casey? Was BEAUTIFUL. Her personality is honestly about 95% of why we will be returning! Thank you for the recommendations but more than anything, just for being so sweet. My little family really enjoyed all of the food. We tasted ribs, rice, chicken, cookies... Everything was just awesome."
"O.M.G.I first found Smalls on Yelp and after reading through the reviews it was a must-try. First off, I'm Filipino myself, so the combination of Filipino/Korean and BBQ flavors grabbed my attention immediately. I dragged my hubs here during a snowstorm the other week because I was just craving to try it. Smalls was exactly what it says - a shack. It's a very small storefront... I think a converted garage... with little seating, so expect to take your food out. The distinctive aqua color makes it easy to spot. The person who took our order, I assume, was the owner. He was super friendly and you could tell he was passionate about what he does. And YES, the food absolutely lived up to the Yelp Hype. The hubby had the BBQ brisket Bibimbap. It was soft, tender, and was a flavorful blend. I had the fried chicken w/fries and banana ketchup. Fried Chicken was crispy on the outside and tender/juicy on the inside. Loved the banana ketchup filipino flair. Still a few other items on the menu I'd love to try!"
"I'm looking forward to becoming a regular at this shop, because my goodness, is it delicious!The fried chicken and the cheese fries are on point! Hands down some of the best fried chicken I've ever had... and I get around. That pepper crust makes me drool.Grilled texas toast? Brilliant!  I'm not usually a fan of garlic, but even the rice was mouth watering! I can't wait to go back to try everything else. Thanks for the warm welcome to my new neighborhood!"
"Been here a couple of times, and always come away happy. This last time however, I was elated.Decided that I'd switch it up from my normal brisket sandwich to the fried chicken. Where do I even begin:Took a little bit of extra time, so call ahead. Chicken came perfectly cooked with a very crunchy, peppery crust. My description doesn't do it justice; go get some.I've eaten some fried chicken in my time... Not like this. Congrats Smalls' you have my vote for best fried chicken I've ever had."
"When I heard of this place in Chicagoland called Smalls that promised Asian-style BBQ, a personal pet idea of mine (think Sriracha rub instead of mustard), I knew it was a must-bookmark. Smalls is a bit out of the way for me, out in Irving Park, but one fine weekday afternoon, I was finally able to swing by it and give it a shot.Here's what I learned. Smalls smokes its meats inside in a refrigerator-looking contraption, a first for me. I didn't ask whether it was traditional charcoal, or if it was a gas or electric device. The BBQ purist in me knows which I'd rather prefer, but I didn't want to offend. Also, the Asian influence in question is Filipino, the ethnicity of the pitmaster, though all sorts of Asian flavors abound.Here's what I loved. The sauces are pretty unreal, from the Thai-based Tiger Cry dipping sauce that comes with the brisket to the Filipino-based banana ketchup that accompanies the fries to the Chinese-American spicy mayo that the fine gentleman at the counter graciously snuck in my bag. Also, all sauces, aside from the banana ketchup, are made in-house.Here's what I liked. The rest, basically, which included an order of brisket and the fried chicken, which recently made Thrillist's best fried chicken in Chicago list. First, the brisket, which was my choice. The brisket itself was rather tasty. I asked for the fatty brisket, and the counter-sir told me that I'd get a heaping portion of both the flat and the point to taste. After trying, I'm still a fatty, or a point, man, and I stand by it.The brisket somewhat reminded me of East Texas style versus Central Texas. BBQ purists in Hill Country firmly believe in the sanctity of the meat, eschewing a medley of spices for a pure salt-pepper rub. The Houston BBQ I grew up with doesn't smoke the meat to that type of perfection, instead relying on a tastier rub and sauce. Likewise, Small's brisket isn't pure-meat perfection, but it is tasty, particularly after dipped in Tiger Cry. The smoke ring was non-existent, and the meat--particularly the lean--was dry, but the crust was sweet, savory, and delicious.The fried chicken followed suit. Bites with the crispy skin were pretty solid, and tasted pretty amazing dipped in the Tiger Cry. Tasting the meat itself, though, was good but not great. The accompanying garlic fries were extremely pepper-y and a party in my mouth, and the toasted rice was surprisingly underrated and a first for me with BBQ.Overall, Smalls was a fun and fairly unique barbecue experience. I only wish it were closer so I could stop by easier. And the next time I'm there, I might just load up on that Tiger Cry."
"I like the concept of the Asian fushion BBQ...but the taste did not meet the expectation.  We got the 2 items they said were the most popular.  The brisket bibimbop... The brisket gives this dish a smokey taste that I didn't enjoy.  The combination is not a good mix. Also got the pulled pork with garlic black bean sauce platter which comes with garlic rice, fries and texas toast. The texas toast just tasted like soggy toast with no flavor.  I like the sauce with the pulled pork and garlic rice.  The fries tasted really weird...it had like a duck after taste.  Maybe they're duck fat fries but I didn't like that at all. Disappointing since everything sounded yummy."
The fried chicken make you wanna hurt yo' Momma! The brisket and garlic rice are yumm-o!
"Triple S has been featured on several Best Of Chicago Fried Chicken lists so I had to give it a try.  First off, it's tucked away in a little corner on Albany right off Irving Park Rd, very easy to miss if you blinked.  It is a tiny shack with limited counter space, although you have the option of carrying out your food and enjoying it at the corner bar next door.  I thought that was a little odd.  We opted to eat at the counter facing the street, but it can get super hot and smoky.  Granted we visited during the end of summer, so by the time we finished eating we were both sweating head to toe.The food itself was okay.  The crust of the fried chicken was definitely crunchy and had a nice texture.  The meat was neither juicy nor dry, somewhere in the middle.  I didn't note any remarkable unique taste, but wished it had more flavor.  We also tried a platter of the brisket.  I appreciate sauce on the side, but if that's the case, I expect the brisket itself to be moist and tender.  It was definitely dry and needed the sauce.  The Filipina gal in me really appreciated and enjoyed the side of toasted garlic rice.  Aside from the fried chicken skin, this was my favorite part of the meal.It was nice to briefly meet the owner, who took our orders and was also cooking up the food.  While we were waiting for our food, we overhead his conversation with another consumer debating the various Harold Chicken Shack locations and which ones were the best.  He was genuinely enthusiastic about his food and fried chicken in general.  You can't help but like a fellow fried chicken aficionado."
"This place is fantastic!  Super tiny!  Friendly staff with nice packaging on my carry out order.  The full slab of ribs (with rice and toast) was yummmy!  The meat was phenomenal. I also ordered the brisket bibimbap-which was unique, flavorful, and delicious.I will return........ Yummy!"
Just keep loving this place more and more!  For my birthday I invited my friends to Lizard's for drinks and we all ordered in smalls.  The service and food were excellent as usual and I fell like everyone at both Lizard's and smalls went out of their way to make sure it was all perfect.  Love love love them and I am happy to say that I turned a lot of people on to the best little restaurant in the city!  oh-and they may not sound like much but their cookies are the best!
This food was soooooo good!  I had fried chicken (white) and brisket. This was the best fried chicken I've ever had. There was also this garlic rice that was to die for. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a BBQ spot.
Very friendly staff here at one of my new favorite spots. Fried chicken is awesome and really like the toasted bread. Always get the cookie and ask about specials. Mexican coke is always good too. New regular here
"A) incredibly friendly, warm, gracious and friendly staff. Thank you for being so genuineB) the most delicious, balanced and fantastic food I could have. BBQ Pork with rice, carrot, cauliflower and fried egg. Sweet Serrano vinegar on the side. OMFG. I'm rarely ""wowed"" by a meal, but this totally did. I was saying to myself the rest of the day, ""holy shit that was delicious"".C) read A & B, repeat."
"Food 5/10Music 10/10Atmosphere 2/10I ordered the brisket bibimbap, at the suggestion of the cashier, no beverage.  Sorry I expected a little more for my money ($12) than a few pieces of dried up brisket and some measly sides! I ordered the garlic rice, which wasn't anything spectacular, except it was cooked with garlic.  This rice was the kind you get at your run of the mill Chinese take-out place.  At least if it was sticky rice, a heftier, chewier rice, it would've tasted much better.  This was small, dried out and tasteless.  Now on to the brisket,  Like the rice, it was dried out and tough, not at all of what I was expecting.  I don't know if this had anything to do with coming there during the week (in the afternoon) when food just sits around and gets stale and they serve it anyway! I finally went back up to the counter and told the person is this how it always (the brisket) is?  Isn't brisket supposed to be moist and chewy?  She promptly took it back and then brought out the good stuff.  Although she still left a few pieces of the old brisket on the tray.  Are you kidding me?  Sides just meh.As far as being friendly, I guess you can say they are, in a fake-nice sort of way, especially when they're only that way because they have a TIP jar as an incentive. As far as I'm concerned, no table service, no tip!  This was really disappointing after reading all the glowing reviews on Yelp.  As far as I'm concerned, this was more of a Yikes than a Yelp!"
"Even among this fried chicken renaissance, Smalls stands out. So good, that I went back to try the bibimbap less than week later, which it turns out, is even better. Get the roasted peppers if they're on special. I might love this restaurant."
"American BBQ with an Asian influence!Brisket + garlic fried rice + flash fried beets = a weird combo that actually works. Our brisket was not as moist as I'd like it to be, but the fried rice with SUNNYSIDE UP EGG and the beets were amazing. GET THE BEETS. Seriously, I've never had beets this good. Crispy on the outside, munch size, and still retains its flavor. Fries? Please. They also sell Mexican cola and Pellegrino drinks. Small place with stools to sit on."
"First time here and we were very pleased!  Not your typical sweet BBQ and the sides are awesome!  We tried the brisket platter and pulled pork platter with the beet box and cheesy fries.  The cheesy fries were topped with pickled veggies, which was a nice surprise!  The brisket was so tender it fell apart on my fork.  The pulled pork had an amazing smokey flavor.  We will definitely come back."
"Tiny place, good luck on seating.. but the food was DAMN good. Service was fun and friendly. At one point the shack actually filled with that delicious smoke and the cook came to open all the doors and try to fan the air out. Kept apologizing, but really.. it was a great smell to go with our food. Cookies were a tasty little treat too! Don't skip those."
"Awesome food, freshly prepared and a delicious take on Korean-meets-Southern BBQ. I had the Pork Bibimbap and it was outstanding! Gotta come back for the fried chicken."
"Hip hop and brisket bap! Ordered the bi bim bap with bbq brisket to go and all their food is made to order. While I was there,  I was treated to the sounds of souls of mischief and de la soul which made the wait bearable. Food was fantastic and I'm definitely interested in coming back for the fried chicken but will order a head of time."
"Difficult to imagine finding service that is more genuinely friendly than at this place. Must be easy staying happy when you're selling delicious food that is so wonderfully and thoughtfully prepared. It's either a family working in that exposed kitchen or just people that love one another as such. No, this is not your home, but I could understand getting confused, what with how comfortable and relaxed you feel inside this tiny little shack that has just 6 chairs.The decor is perfectly imperfect. A delicate balance of creativity and whimsy. Can't forget to mention the subtle Asian flair.Smalls makes a bold move by relying on their meat, not the sauce, as that is served on the side. And although it's tasty, try some bites without it. Rich, smokey flavor...you'll see. To speak of, the brisket, pulled pork, beat box, and seasoned fries, which are seemingly hand cut, are all delicious. It's all homemade. Whaaat?! They put my name on the bag with the salted caramel cookie in it? Also delicious. Don't make us go all ""see you next time"" on you, Smalls. Ok, fine. We will."
The food is delicious! I had the Filipino BBQ special and I was not disappointed. Only drawback is that the place is teeny and no outdoor seating. It's more of a takeaway spot. I'd sit on a plastic chair outside if it was available!
"Fried chicken, bibimbop...it's all good! Check out the daily specials too!"
Where do I start. This place lives up to its name because it's really small.  As I walk in all I hear it music R&B you could say. Then the guy explains the menu to us I felt he did a great job. So my husband ordered the brisket and beets which taste  really good I order I have a half white chicken and it takes about 20 minutes it was really great will be returning it only has by bar stools to sit and eat but the food is great great place. Make sure you try the banana ketchup and a cucumber they are delicious. You can smell the food before you even get in the door. I really wasn't looking at the prices of the food because it was smelling so good I just wanted to eat. So more about the chicken it was really crispy and moist and fries are served in a little white tub ..I only have one bad thing to say but then it wouldn't live up to its name it needs tables so people can sit and eat...
"I had my heart set on this place.  Mix of asian fusion with appealing to Filipino flavor and ingredients...SIGN ME UP!But alas, I can say Smalls, Smoke Shack & More leaves me....wanting MORE.I had their BBQ Brisket Bimbimbop which was ok. I didn't quite get the flavor of the meat as much.  The kimchi was a nice touch to the plate.I should have opted for the Chicken which will be my next endeavor."
"The brisket in amazing. The staff is amazing as well! This neighbor spot is a must.,,"
"You can smell the smoky BBQ aroma when you pull into your parking spot. That little blue building that is Smalls was our destination for lunch take out.  I had been eying this place for a while since it's so highly touted by my friend JW. The menu isn't huge, but it does offer some cool takes on Korean and Filipino food. What we ordered...Meat, lots of it. That was our family meal.1/4 dark Fried Chicken served with Texas Toast, seasoned fries and a side of banana ketchupBeef Brisket Bibimbap--choice of garlic rice or white rice. I wanted full on flavor so I went with garlic rice. P Parada 1/2 slab glazed St. Louis ribs, served with garlic riceThe fried chicken looked a little over-fried to me, but the meat itself was juicy and full of flavor. And the banana ketchup is nothing like the Banana ketchup I've had in the PI, this was better and almost like tomato ketchup. I honestly didn't care for the fries (my toddler son loved them by the way). I love fresh cut fries but the next time I order them, I'll ask them for plain. I don't know what the spices were, but if I had to guess, it was like Chinese 5 spice, which is ok, but it seemed like there just too much of it. My husband seemed to love them, but I didn't care for the ribs. Now I love Filipino style BBQ and this was reminiscent of it. I wouldn't be surprised if they're marinated in 7up/garlic/soy sauce (or something similar) first, but the glaze was super salty and just not appetizing to me.  When eaten with the garlic rice, it helps tone down the sodium, but it was just too much salt.  The garlic rice was full of flavor and well made. This was a huge portion and it was enough for all of us to get a good sample. Now the Bibimbap, that was just delicious.  The brisket is cut up in chunks.  CHUNKS of flavorful, tender meat in garlic rice, topped with a fried egg.. I wish there were more of the veggies--pickled daikon, carrots, bean sprouts--but that's just me. This was also a huge portion. I got to chat with one of the owners and he was very nice. I appreciate that the menu concept pulls from different parts of the globe. Everything is made to order so expect a short wait."
Almost walked by this place but so happy we didn't. Had the brisket platter (rice was even amazing) and the pork sandwich which didn't last long. I would definitely say check this place out if you live or travel around here.
"Great combination of flavorful American BBQ with a new exotic touch. Do your tastebuds a ""flavor"" get your next lunch at SMALLS."
"Solid bbq. Bibimbap is among the best in the city. Service is superb and very friendly. If it's in season, get the elote. It's worth the top dollar"
"This place really is SMALL! Don't expect to eat inside -- there are only a handful of bar-like seats. Don't worry, it's worth it."
"One whiff and I knew I was going to be eating good. This place is incredible. It's not a true bbq joint in the sense that it's not really American style so instead of white bread and baked beans you'll have seasoned rice and kimchi, but the way they smoke their meat won't have anyone complaining. Seriously this is one of the best meals I've ever had. We had their fried chicken, the brisket platter, and the bibimbap with brisket and each dish was bursting with flavor. You can't go wrong with any of them but my favorite was probably the brisket platter.For sides we had their beets which were delicious and will satisfy even the very non-vegetarian diner as a veggie side. The sweet corn with seasoning was also tasty.They do bbq better than many of the traditional bbq spots in the city"
"My friend and I decided to have a night in with some good food and a movie.  We decided to get take-out from Smalls, so I called ahead of time to place our order.  The gentleman who took my order was extremely friendly and helpful with suggestions, and just as friendly in person when I went to pick up our order.I came mainly for the fried chicken and was really disappointed.  Although very juicy and tender on the inside, the outside was extremely charred and rather bland.  However, the fries and banana ketchup that came with the chicken was amazing.  I need to buy that banana ketchup -- I'd put it on everything!We also shared the bi bim bop -- this hit the spot!  The brisket was so tender and flavorful and I loved the carrots, daikon and fried egg that accompanied it.Overall, the price point for the quality of food is great.  Being a fried chicken lover, this is not the place for it.  I'll have to come back to try something else!"
"Been wanting to come here since spring, i had read about this place for awhile... then my cuzin posted some article about the top 5 places for fried chicken yesterday..... the first and only place i haven't yet tried was this place Smalls.... and so here i am today.... And all i have to say was WOW!!!!! i can't believe how perfect and crispy the chicken was....... and i hate to say this... but i am so glad that you had rice.... and not just any rice... garlic fried rice, and a nice fried egg on top, and for the side  i pick the long green bean, and that was very tasty.... my meal was perfect, plus there was toast, and pickle veggies, and banana ketchup... that was a plus for me... i love banana ketchup....... All i have to say was thanks for making my dinner awesome...."
Really unusual excellent food. Garlic rice perfect. Brisket pretty much as good as it gets north of Oklahoma.  Recommended.
"I realize this is a smoke shack and the specialty is, well, meat.  But this place has THE.BEST.COOKIES.  I know, you would never think.  It's brown butter and brown sugar and the perfect amount of salt on top.  These are honestly the best cookies I've ever had.  They even sell the dough so you can bake them at home and pretend it's your own recipe."
SO. DAMN. GOOD. I love this place! Great food! Great service! Lots of exclamation points!
"You go here to get your food & go. You can wait for or eat at the next door bar, if you wish. Their Bibmbop is great. Their French fries are to DIE for!!! I'd go here just for them! Bibm Bop, garlic rice, and ribs are personal favs..."
So exciting to have a place like this in the neighborhood. I had the filipino bbq plate and it was amazing.
"Brisket rocks like to try sauces, the chicken was super crunch but lacked salt and seasoning. It's a cute spot but easy to miss look for the blue."
"Blind is the word I would to accurately describe my experience today at smalls. A bright blue structure belittled by nearly everything around it. I blindly walked in, on a whim and quickly my expectations were blindsided. I was greeted with a smile, a how to you do, and most importantly the scent of something spectacular. I quickly looked to the menu and to my surprise saw nothing that sounded like tradition barbeque. Caught off guard I took my time but eventually asked the cashier what I should get. It ended up as a decision between and special or the brisket sandwich. Hoping to not delve too deep during my first expedition at smalls., I ended up getting the brisket. The next ten minutes were agonizing. A woman near me (granted you're near to everyone at smalls.) was handed half a fried chicken that had been soaking in buttermilk and the smell that came off of her tray nearly had me foaming at the mouth. Soon after though my name was called. The cashier, and as I had soon realized the chef as well, explained to me what was on my tray. There was brisket, texas toast, pickled vegetables, tiger cry, a little sample of the special (very kind of them), jalapeno vinegar, seasoned fries, and banana ketchup. I put down the vegetables and tiger cry sauce on to one piece of the texas toast and closed up the sandwich. And then the magic happened. I care not to go on too much longer as I have already said what feels to be the set up for the novel that was this tray. Everything on this tray was beyond perfect. Every element of this meal was incredibly unique but worked together in a way that most if not all dishes that I have eaten in my lifetime have. Blind is possible the best way I could have come into smalls. because it gave me an entirely different experience than what I was looking for. I am perfectly happy to recommend this to everyone who is anyone and look forward to a many trips back to 4009 N. Albany street in the future."
"We ordered the brisket platter and the pork platter, which were really quite fantastic on their own - the pork (my order) was tender and sweet, I sampled the sauces but ended up not using them - the meat really didn't need it. The garlic rice and the toast were huge portions and delicious. I tried the brisket, it was just...OK. It wasn't bad, its just that I have had better. But THEN I was surprised with a special order of hot chicken. It was their fried chicken but they added a sauce that had some crazy combination of ghost peppers, serrano peppers, habanero and cayenne. WOOOOOO too hot for me but I'm glad I tried it!I really like the odd combination of Asian-style BBQ - I would definitely come back here. Great food."
"Small joint, BIG ass flavor. Brisket, ribs, pulled pork all so damn delicious. Best fries in town too. If you like huge hunks of smoky, juicy, tender meat that melts in your mouth; get yourself some smalls."
"I could probably eat here every day. Even though its not traditional BBQ, still one of my favorite BBQ places in the city.They really nail the idea of fusion food: take the best textures and flavors of one type of cuisine, and combine them with the best of another type of cuisine in unique, inventive ways.Ate here with my brother and sister in-law and my wife. Everyone gave it a thumbs up. As an added bonus, the Chef/co-owner was incredibly helpful in helping us pick gluten free options for my celiac wife. Really went above and beyond. We ordered probably half of the menu, and weren't disappointed by a single thing so you really can't choose poorly.Downsides are very few: it's a very small place, so you probably want to get carry-out. And they are closed Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. I guess I can understand why if the traffic is slow, but like I said, I could eat here every day (even Sunday)."
"The service is friendly, attentive and the food is fantastic.  I recommend anything that will get you a side of banana ketchup.  The brisket in any firm is a must!"
"Run, do not walk, to @smallschicago right now!  A friend recommended getting over here real quick-like, so I stopped by today for lunch and I was not disappointed.  Tried the brisket, garlic rice, Texas toast, and elote corn...as good as all of this was, the house-made sauces (tiger cry and some other spicy dipping sauce) were the highlight for me.  Got a lot of food for $13; next time I'll drop in for a sandwich since I can't afford to do this for lunch every day.The space is as small as you think it is, basically counter service plus room for 3-5 single adults on barstools.  Take this to go unless you are like me and show up at 11 AM to an empty restaurant.  The guys behind the counter were cool and I'm excited to hit this again soon."
"This place would be much better characterized as fusion than barbecue. They don't do traditional BBQ sauces and the meat had a decent smokiness but nothing special. The exiting thing here is what they do with sides - the garlic rice was absolutely amazing, the fries delicious, even the house made pickles were great. You'll enjoy your visit here - as long as you come in looking for the right thing!"
"I served smalls fried chicken at a party I hosted. Everyone loved it. The meat was perfectly cooked and the seasoning is done to perfection as well. If you haven't tried smalls, you must check it out. The staff is super awesome too."
"I ordered the garlic rice, pickles and side of long beans.  It was great!  I highly recommend this place!"
"Absolutley great.everything on my plate was excellent.had the sliced brisket it was great had a nice sauce with it,rice,and the beets,all great.tasted my wifes chicken,so good had to get a full order to go but it tastes way better hot and fresh.place is a little hard to spot just look down the way for the blue shack.will be back for sure."
"I had really high hopes, been wanting to try this place for a while... but found the food almost inedible. We ordered the chicken and pork bimbambop. The pork was half fat and saturated in salt. The chicken was burnt and dry. If you like this type of food, I recommend crisp in lakeview."
"Smalls is a neighborhood bbq shop. The shop is little bit off street but not hard to find since it has bright blue color at front. They are very friendly people and the food is very delicious. They also have some items that have an asian twist like, kimchi, philinino, ..... It is very small place so I recommend to do take out for many people party."
"I feel like I'm always livin large when I walk outta Smalls. Maybe it's because my apartment is probably larger than Smalls entire shack. Maybe it's because they practically know me by name now. Or maybe it's because the food is so damn delicious that I can barely stop myself from ripping open that brown paper bag as soon as it's placed in my hot little Asian hands? We may never know...But I will tell you what I do know. I am addicted to that bibimbop-you don't stoppah! Smalls does a stellar take on this Korean dish of rice, pickled veg & bbq'd meat...or in Smalls' case: BRISKET, yo! Big, flavorful, tender chunks of heavenly smoked brisket. Excuse me while I wipe the drool from my chin... Smalls serves up a mean order of fried chicken also. Served with seasoned fries, not-slaw (aka, pickles) and banana ketchup. The chicken is always cooked perfectly and served piping hot & juicy while maintaining a nice hard crunch on the outside. Admittedly, I can take or leave the fries. Sometimes I like the anise spice and sometimes I'm just not about it but I do dig their banana ketchup. Pulled pork. It's not going to be what you think, probably. Smalls is not your typical saucy bbq joint. You're not going to find anything slathered in bbq sauce. It's all about smoked meats here. That said, the pulled pork is served with a bacon mustard and it's pretty fantastic. Bacon mustard. Get on this, party people!And Ooooooohh...on the TLC tip: Always ask what the specials are including the Veg of the Day. I am a fan of the long beans & yu-choy. Get garlic rice with your bop-you don't stoppah. Smalls also does special wings on occasion and during Lent they did this shrimp toast sammie which was crazy sexy cool.Yo if I need it in the morning or the middle of the nightI ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)My lovin' is strong and Smalls got it goin' on andI ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)2 inches or a yard of brisekt in a bop or on a sammichI ain't 2 proud 2 beg (no)So it ain't like I'm braggin' just join the Smalls paddywagon causeI ain't 2 proud. I ain't 2 proud 2 beg!"
"Found this little gem as we were thinking of going to honey butter fired chicken and decided to try it on a whim.  I'm glad we did!  Smalls smoke shack is exactly what it sounds like  the restaurant was tiny!  however, no worries because you can order and they will bring the food over to you to the bar next store, I think it's called lizard lounge?We ordered the Filipino ribs, friend chicken, and the brisket bibimbop, meat overload!  The chicken takes approximately 20 minutes to make since it's made to order.  However it we found out you can call ahead of time!  The friend chicken had a hint of curry powder and we were all pleasantly surprised.  My favorite was the brisket bibimbop.  I mean it's brisket and bibimbop married together.  What made it even more outstanding was that it was made with garlic fried rice!  YUM!  The ribs were also perfectly cooked with a delicious sweet yet smokey flavor.  Let's just say everyone left satisfied and we had the meat sweats all night long!The only tip I give you is to either ask for extra silverware, as we were trying to be fancy and each with the plastic silverware and several broke.  Or you can just throw on a napkin and eat with your hands, don't worry i'm not judging!"
"Kenny and I wanted to give this place a try after seeing Steve Dolinsky's video. I ordered the same thing Steve Dolinsky did-- the brisket bibimbop with garlic rice. Unfortunately, my brisket bibimbop didn't live up to my expectations. The entire box (we had to order ours to be delivered to Lizard's next door as there was no more seating available at the very small smoke shack) was way too salty for my liking. It was a small box of food, and I couldn't even finish it because it was so salty. The egg wasn't as runny as I'd have liked, and the briskets were a lot drier than I thought they would be. Even Kenny found it salty, which surprised me because his tolerance for sodium is much greater than mine."
"Took my wife to Smalls for dinner tonight.  We are always on the lookout for new BBQ joints and this place did not disappoint. I got the pulled pork platter. I wasn't a fan of the sauce that came on the side but the pork was so delicious that it didn't need sauce anyway. My wife got the brisket platter and she enjoyed it as well. The tiger cry sauce was really good. We both enjoyed the hand cut fries with banana ketchup and the garlic rice was delicious as well. Seating is minimal at best, but it wasn't busy when we got there so we got a seat with no problem. The service was extremely friendly and definitely made us feel welcome."
"Great spot! BBQ with flair. Love that they are trying some more international versions/fusion of BBQ. Super small place, so really would only be for take-out, but they also bring you the food to the bar next door Lizard's Lounge, which is just as good as being at a restaurant. I am looking forward to doing some take-out for the family from here soon and trying some of their other dishes. Definitely worth a try."
Great food. Tasty combinations.  Fast friendly service.  Would give it five stars if I could dine there.  If it was a full size restaurant.
"Smalls has been on my radar before its doors even opened. However, I never had the chance to stop by. So with my impending move from the city of wind, I added Smalls to my Chicago bucket list.Enough with the fluff, let's get to the good stuff that will have you taking trips here. Savory, succulent chicken that is freshly fried while you wait. Plus house cut fries, seasoned just right, complemented with banana ketchup.... definitely a delicious combo!The owners are also very down to earth. Kudos to Joaquin and his extensive classic hip hop knowledge! Our music discussion made the time fly, while my friend's additional to go chicken order was prepared.... a very satisfied check, for this bucket list item."
"This place is incrediable!  I came on a Saturday evening after I had stopped and sampled two other restaurants, and I seriously wish I came here on an empty stomach.  I order the pulled pork sandwhich and my brother ordered the ribs.  My pulled pork was just ok nothing real big about it taste wise but the mustard they give you with it is really good.  The fries that come with it are truely amazing and spiced with all kinds of deliciousness.  You also get a small cup of pickle salad and it is very fresh and great tasting.My brother's ribs were the best ribs I ever tasted!  These had a garlicy punch to them and were savory and succulant.  I wish I ordered these!  See the ribs are a Korean style and they do it just right.  The meal also comes with this incredible tasting rice, and beats that are really really good and fresh tasting.  This place uses all fresh food and the owners are super friendly.  The one downfall of this place is how it is too small, and with this type of food and quality, they would be in such a better place if they had a dine spot instead of this tiny carry out that only like 4 people can eat in there.  I definately want to try their fried chicken because it looked good.  They ran out of it while we were there due to the chicken shortage that has been going around.  I will defiantely return here!"
Hands down the best fried chicken! And I've tried almost every fried chicken joint in the city
Drove By a number of times and finally stopped in and super glad i did.  Hard to find if you aren't looking and it is small.....guy working was super friendly and open to me asking questions and decided on two sandwiches......couldn't make my mind up so why the hell not......the pulled pork was honestly one of the better ones i have had in a Long time.  Smokey and fell apart.... Brisket was very good and loved the fries and all the sauces....give it a go soon there will be line soon
Pretty amazing. I had one of their special bibimbop's with spicy pork and it was perfect. Great customer service. Very small place. If doing take out I would recommend ordering in advance.
"We ate here for lunch on a Friday, and honestly, I was blown away.  Its teeny, as the name suggests with 6 stools.  We ordered the bbq brisket bibimbap which was too exciting NOT to order.  Loved it - everything down to the Kimchi.  My husband had the pork platter, and I proclaimed this very loudly ""this is the best pork I have ever had in my life.""  Even told the chef and others that would listen.  Its that good.  If you're a bbq sauce kinda person, they don't have it here.  Its smoked.  Its amazing.  Its almost life changing.  We also had the veg of the day which were blistered shishitos, and as a shishito connoisseur I was very pleased.I will be their new regular, ordering for take out as often as possible!Seriously, its that good."
Favorite BBQ in the city. Brisket is outstanding - not fatty and not drowned in sauce. The side items like the beets are unique and delicious. Owner is a great guy with a great BBQ background. Never had a bad meal and have been there over 10 times.
"when we first pulled into this place, it was kind of scary. It was small, like, really small! We weren't sure if that was the place or not. Once we ordered our food and while they were cooking it, smoke filled the whole place to the point where they had to open the front and the back door to let the smoke out but honestly I had no problem with the delicious smelling of the smoked meat :) having say that is probably one of the best experience I had here.so we ordered the smoked brisket, it was chopped (which was awesome), but only some part of the brisket was juicy and tender, half of it was pretty dry and tough to chew. It doesn't come with any bbq sauce which is fine because you can dip the meat in the banana ketchup if you want. we also got the Filipino style St. Louis ribs, that was good. The ribs were salty with a hint of spicyness to it. It didn't fall off the bones ribs but it was definetly different. The only thing that is really bad was the garlic rice. I know fried rice is used with overnight cooked refridgerated rice, but this rice was super hard! It was really bland, there is not a lot of flavor in the rice. The total came out to $33So bottom line is I will give this place a 3 stars for the nice greetings from the guy in front, but I wouldn't come back to this place. Just a couple minutes more down the street on Pulaski there is a BBQ place called Smoque and I think that has better ribs and better brisket as well."
"LOVE this place! Literally want to try everything on the menu. I am stoked to see more creative asian fusion spots opening up in Chicago. The staff here puts a lot of love & soul into the food.As a filipino-american, I appreciate the food even more. Think traditional american BBQ meats served with asian flavors & sides. It makes me think about how growing up, my family served almost everything with rice- steak with rice, fried chicken with rice, thanksgiving turkey with rice, etc. I'm sure other asians can relate lolHere's what I have tried so far:-Filipino BBQ Glazed St. Louis Ribs: (5/5) Great flavor, no sauce needed, served with garlic fried rice yum.-BBQ Brisket Bibimbap: (4/5) Everything tasted great on its own, but personally I would rather eat the brisket on a sandwich or with fries.-Filipino BBQ Plate: (5/5) this is not on the regular menu, but is one of the current specials displayed by the register. It has the flavor of the traditional filipino pork bbq, but is sliced smaller, fattier & is not skewered. It's also served with garlic rice :)-House Cut Fries: (5/5) Served with banana ketchup! It tastes like they mix in american ketchup which gives it a better consistency.Do yourself a favor & go here NOW! Do yourself another favor & wear something casual because you'll probably leave smelling like smoke."
"I'd been wanting to try small's smoke shack and more since I'd seen them listed as #1 on Steve dolinsky's (hungry hound, chicago food critic) list of best fried chicken spots. Then the same name popped up in a thrillist list of best ribs. So I was prepared to travel clear across the city to hit this place up.It's crazy small, like one room but they some bar stools in the small place and word on the street, you can order your food, grab a drink and eat it at lizard lounge next door. I came in, like 5 minutes to close and they still let me order the fried chicken, which takes 20 minutes. Joaquin was enthusiastic and willing to walk me through the menu and concept (remember they were closing in 5 minutes). I ordered my food (to go, of course).I ordered1. Fried chicken- just as amazing as I thought it would be. Crispy, flavorful, moist chicken. It came with a sauce, on the side, that it didn't even need. Every bite, the southern girl in me swooned.2. Brisket bibimbap- do not fear, this is not that weird brisket meat that you order in Chinese restaurants that's somewhat gooey and chewy. This is fantastic BBQ brisket meat with all those pickled vegis and a beautiful poached egg. This was the best fusion dish I had. A perfect marriage of fantastic BBQ and an unapologetically authentic Korean staple.3. Asian wings- sweet, salty, cooked (perhaps grilled) to perfection. And they are full wings, not those skimpy wing pieces.4. I got free fries, because they forgot it in someone else's order. Their loss, my gain. They were fresh cut fries with this crack-like sauce that I, without shame, licked off my fingers as I devoured them like they were my last meal...man, I love potatoes.All in all, service was a breath of fresh air, Joaquin and I chatted while waiting for my food. He was humble, despite being open for only year and being written up in numerous publications for their exceptional food. I've been telling everyone I know to give this place a try and it's totally worth the trek."
The best smoked tofu I've had in the city. So good! Highly recommend going here. We found out about the tofu by walking by and reading the menu through the window after they had closed for the day. The chef came out to see if we had any questions about the menu and to apologize for being closed. He said they smoke their own tofu. And they do an amazing job.
"Soooooo good!  The ribs were fantastic, and the portion size was larger than what you would get anywhere else.  I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken ever, but I have to say that theirs was the best.  The service at the counter rocks.....they even brought our food when it was ready to the bar next door.  Go there.  You won't regret it."
"I do like Smalls and see myself coming here over and over again.  First of all, you get a lot for your money and the food is excellent (although it could use a little less salt).  My friend and I ordered a half slab of the Filipino bbq glazed St. Louis ribs and a platter of the cherry wood pulled pork.  Both came with Texas toast and 2 sides.  The half slab of ribs ($14.00) was surprisingly HUGE!!  I was amazed at how much we got for the price and imagined how big the full slab would be...probably enough to last me a week!  Great flavor and lots of meat!  The pulled pork was very tasty as well.  As for the sides, the fries were okay...there was a spice on them that I wasn't used to.  The toasted garlic rice was with no doubt, garlicky, which I love, and the charred elotes were alright.  I would get it again as an included side for a meal, but I wouldn't pay $3 for it alone.  I'd go across the street instead and get the elotes from the cart.The workers are friendly and helpful and the place is extremely small.  No place to sit down to eat, it's a take-out place.  You can stand up and eat, that's about it.  It can get hot in there, especially on a 90+ degree day with only one AC being overwhelmed by the heat from the kitchen.  I was dripping sweat while waiting, but that's ok...it was worth it!!Next time I come here, I""m trying the bibimbap, brisket, and chicken!"
"Dude. Might be better that Smoque. Yeah...I said it. Smalls in Irving Park is one one of the best BBQ joints in chicago and certainly on the north side. Come here and get some smokey goodness. Hickory smoked brisket, buttermilk brined chicken, and cherry wood pulled pork. Pulled pork is the best.  They also have filipino bbq glazed st louis ribs (really?) that i have to go back for.  Also try to the garlic rice and the green beans.  Wow. So good and u must try."
"I am friggin' in love with Smalls. Some of the best BBQ I've ever had with unique flavors and a nice variety of items to order. Everyone is nice there, prices are affordable and the food is high quality.Looks like those who gave 2 and 3 star reviews either have taste bud deficiencies or just had an item that was off, which does happen. I'm not excusing that.What's important is my opinion, damnit, cuz almost everything at Smalls is on point.  The buttermilk fried chicken is tastier and crispier than Honey Butter Fried Chicken. GASP! He said what?  Hipsters might be at my doorstep with molotov cocktails of craft bourbon and a tallboy PBR, but I just think this tiny shack has better fried chicken and BBQ on point with places like Smoque (which I love).I've read a complaint about the size of the bimbimbop.  This gentleman said it's a small portion.  Don't eat it in the box, put it a bowl. It's actually a lot of food.Filipino BBQ and the cheese fries are revelations. Get the ""Jenna Special"" if you want a awesome, off menu items. Basically, it's the Filipino BBQ pork but subbing the pork for the ridiculous panko crusted tofu.Also, if smoked chicken is on the menu. Get it, now. Finally tried it and it's the truth.Everything is on point here. EVERYTHING.Joaquin is the man also. Always playing good music and a good dude all around. Support this local biz!"
"great little jointwe really liked the brisket and chicken, not as much a fan of their ribs"
"First off, not a lot of space to eat. But so what. The fried chicken is absolutely amazing, the pork is tasty, and the sides are delicious. If you really want to sit down to eat, walk up the block to Lizards Liquid Lounge and enjoy a beer with it."
"Wow!  Small little unassuming ""Shack"" nestled right off Irving Park Road/ It's Blue!  First off, the guy that takes your order (Owner?) is awesome and very helpful.  Small, simple menu with smoked meats and fried chicken.  I tried the pulled pork and it's outstanding!  Bacon mustard sauce? All you need to know.  Great fries and one final tip: Grilled Elotes with Japanese Mayo? Do not miss this, trust me/ can't wait to go back for that Fried Chicken.. GTFJD"
"Quick:  Great fried chicken, another awesome option for us 60618 people.Long:  I'll be honest, I'll pretty much try any restaurant by me if it's been written in a magazine.  Of course I pretend that I didn't hear about via  an article or a web mention, but that's exactly how I come across most of the cool places.Really liked the fried chicken.  Great flavor, got the 1/2 mixed half wife half dark.  I can be a big eater and I could not really finish it.  The not slaw and fries were great too.  Chicken had great crunch but the meat was extremely juicy.  I'm guessing the chicken is brined the night before.I love fried chicken and I can see why Steve Dolinsky gave Smalls a thumbs up.Go there.  Go there now.  Right now."
"Went here for the first time this past weekend and the food was AMAZING!! We had the brisket sandwich and the pulled pork platter. The meat was super smoky, tender and juicy. The meat is so good that the excellent sauce they give you isn't even necessary but does give things an extra kick. You really can't go wrong with anything from Smalls and you will know you made the right choice when you walk in to pickup your order and the delicious smell smacks you in the face. Enjoy!!"
"5 big stars for doing some different and doing it awesome!I've had this spot on my bookmarks for a while mainly because I was intrigued at what they were doing.  Call me food-ignorant but doing barbeque with a total asian twist, is news to me and I think they do it right and with soul.It's a small store-front, not meant for big parties or really for any type of intimate or friendly night out.  We were a party of three and when it got busy, did feel a little tight.  I wanted to order everything on the menu but I practiced a bit of restraint, here's the verdict:What I loved: Everything really.- Wings: they were a special that night, holy moley, amazing.  Really great flavor and came on a mound of kick-ass fried rice and some pickled daikon perhaps that really balanced the flavor of the super flavorful wings... I think I enjoyed the wings better than the chicken... although that's like comparing green delicious vs red delicious apples (i digress)- Bibimbap brisket: How ingenious really!  The brisket meat was different than the brisket they serve ala carte, more flavor to match the awesome plate of bibimbap greatness.  Loved the garlic fried rice.  Still can taste the deliciousness as I'm typing- Brisket: so much smokiness, I took it home in my clothes.  Perhaps I'll ask if they do a moist version for kicks sometime --  THAT WOULD BE AMAZING.Liked:- Fried chicken:  So i think i need to retry another time when I don't get these super-flavorful dishes because in comparison, the chicken was good but bland in comparison.  the banana-ketchup is really outstanding though.Love this place.  Love the concept.  Love what they're doing out back and can tell they really love what they do.GO.  NOW.  HURRY."
"Great food!! This place is easy to pass up since it's just north of Irving Park and there isn't a sign in front. However, the entire building is painted in blue so that's key when looking for it.Food was awesome and the staff even more so.If you're looking for great food that's creative and homestyle to boot, check it out"
"Amazing fried chicken! Be prepared to wait! Also, not much seating, ordering out is the way to go. Very fresh, flavorful, crunchy on the outside yet still moist and juicy on the inside!"
"Just stopped by for their brisket platter, which was fall off the fork. Comes with rice, toast, pickles, and awesome fries. There is some asian influence spices in their sauces. Great twist on good bbq flavors. Definitely coming again. Fyi - only about six chairs inside so best to take it to go!"
"I could echo the accolades of many others here about smalls food but it would probably be redundant. Instead, I'd like to praise smalls for their outstanding customer service. I usually do the lunch ordering for work and they always have my food order ready and waiting. I've also ordered from them while at the bar next door and they deliver it when its ready. I love that they are in the neighborhood where I work and live and aren't snobby hipsters like many nearby places. I hope they are here forever and ever. Oh, well darn, the smoked wings are so freakin delicious. Had to mention it anyway."
"I was so excited to try Smalls, unfortunately I came away disappointed. I tried both the pork and brisket, and both were average at best.  Rice was solid as were the fries. Tiger Cry sauce and Banana Ketchup were nice compliments, can't say the same for the bean sauce for the pork. If only the meat was better, as it wasn't very juicy and was surprisingly dry, especially so on the brisket. With Smoque just down the street I doubt I'll be back."
"I always say, try everything...twice. I'm glad I do. The first time we got carryout it was just ok and I would've given it 3 stars. Last night we tried it again and it was awesome. We got the pulled pork plate w/ fries and the brisket plate w/ beets. Then we spit everything so we could try all of it. It was seriously amazing. We ate practically everything. We'll be back."
"We were super excited to try this place since Asian BBQ is a totally underserved niche. We ordered a half slab of ribs and a half order of dark chicken (lol at white chicken, who would order that and at a higher price too?) along with the vegetable special which was chinese broccoli.The ribs were the highlight. First off these are not saucy and they are not tender, hewing more closely to a toothsomeness more common among Asian ribs. I prefer my ribs a little more tender, but the wife really liked them. They have a light smoky flavor that I would describe as only a slightly Asiatic spice.The chicken was perfectly fried, but I found it underseasoned. Discussion upthread suggests this might be due to inconsistencies, but I can only go by what I ate and it tasted like pretty much any other fried chicken.Chinese broccoli was tasty, though not as spicy as the person taking our order claimed. We both enjoyed the cucumber salad but wondered why the portion was so small, it's just cucumbers after all. Garlic rice not very garlicky and a bit dry to be honest and the texas toast was pretty mediocre being not much more than lightly charred white bread. Lastly were the fries which tasted fine but were texturally limp. My wife would have preferred regular ketchup over the banana version as well.Overall not worth the long transit for us."
"I stumbled into this place recently with a friend after searching for the closest friend chicken on my Yelp app. Hooray! I was tittering with anticipation from the second I walked in.We had:Smoked brisket sandwich: my favorite item! The mean was so tender, I could not believe it. I dipped it into the clear vinegar-y sauce it came with, and I was happy. Very happy.Half chicken mixed light/dark: Very, very good. Very crispy. The meat was flavorful and so was the breading. However, it was fried a little too dark. I could tell they fried it dark on purpose, but this was too much. A couple of the pieces had actual burnt bits that just tasted like carbon. Next time I'll ask for slightly lighter fry on my chicken.Fries: So peppery, so good. Couldn't stop eating them, smothered in banana ketchup.Veg of the day: was beets with spicy mayo. Yum.Service was very friendly and helpful, and our quick-casual dine-in was cozy on a cold snowy night.I am VERY EXCITED to order more while I have some beers at Lizards around the corner. I want to try the bibimbop!"
"We were stoked to see this place open. Nice little walk up space. We've been there twice and have had the pork brisket, the bibimbap and the chicken. The chicken is crisp juicy and spot on. Really enjoyed it. Their going to have problems getting people to come and wait 20-25 minutes for chicken with basically no seating. The brisket was a shade on the dry side. The rub was good if a bit salty, The bibimbap was almost there, but as it used the aforementioned brisket, it was a tad salty. Also, my order was missing chili paste and the daikon so that kind of diminished the experience. But they just opened so they get a pass and some time to get the kitchen worked out. Good chicken and potential in other area's. The bap is almost there. The help's courteous. I'm going to give them some time and give it a third shot. They might need to move to bigger space."
"Amazing food; not traditional bbq and totally surprising in a great way!  I went because my husband kept raving about it - and was a little skeptical.  I don't eat pork, beef or poultry so felt like i was going to be eating sides or going hungry.  First of all - if I had only eaten sides....it still would've been delicious.However...there is food for vegetarians!  And not just veggie burger (I'm putting a vegetarian dish on the menu but it's only to check that box).  I ate a tofu sandwich that had great flavor and the fries are ah-mazing.  I think they put clove or some crazy awesome spice in them.  And the ketchup? Homemade...also fabulous!It's a really small location, barely any seating inside.  But no worries - you can go next door to Lizard's and wait (get a drink) and eat over there.  It was a totally laid-back experience with great service (the guy at the counter let me hem & haw over the menu with no rush).We will definitely be back."
"Very good food. Bibimbap is so good, just right amount of spice. Filipino bbq and buttermilk fried chicken are awesome too! Staff is friendly. This is just a very small place but will leave you a full stomach."
"One of my buds recently went to smalls, so I was compelled to check it out myself.  It is a tiny (small?) shack tucked away on Albany just north of Irving Park, and adjacent to Lizard Lounge.  At least the exterior is a bright turquoise color, so it jumps off the page when you pass by.  Although I was ordering food to go only for myself, I wanted to try several different things on their brief menu.  I chose the dark meat quarter portion of the fried chicken, which came with fries, Texas toast, and banana ketchup.  I also ordered a half slab of St. Louis ribs, plopped atop a side of Filipino-style garlic rice.  Each order came with a tiny (small?) cup of ""not slaw"".  While the portion sizes were very reasonable (the half-slab barely fit in the box), none of the food items blew me away.  The ""buttermilk brined"" fried chicken was crunchy and juicy enough, but the fries and toast were just OK (perhaps not ideal stuff for a take away meal).  The ribs do not come with sauce and tasted fine as is, though the pile of rice at the bottom of the box is awkward to eat without its own container.  You could eat inside smalls, but after a line develops in the store you will feel like you are doing time in a penalty box (unlike an actual penalty box at an ice rink, smalls is rather smoky inside).  They seem to have an arrangement with the Lizard Lounge next door where you can have your food delivered there to enjoy.  Perhaps that would be the best way to try a meal from smalls."
Holy chicken! Ive died and gone to chicken heaven. I dont know what all the hype is about with honey butter fried chicken but they cant come close to Smalls chicken. Juicy and delish. Ive had everything on the menu and its all excellent. They are pumpin BIG flavor outta this small place. A must try place! Smalls is Huge!
Don't let the small exterior fool you... This place has HUGE flavors! Amazing food is always accompanied by smiles and a genuine owner who wants to know how you like his food. My wife and i love this place!!!! They have a creative spin on some traditional dishes that are amazing. Highly recommend this for a great lunch! A+++
"I gotta say, their chicken may be better than Honey Butter Fried Chicken. Moist, crispy, wonderful. And they literally cook it right there in front of you. A great place for take-out."
Amazing. Even better now that they will be open more days! Best long beans in the city. Love that we can get BBQ and a side of veg.
"I was intrigued by the ""asian influenced"" BBQ and dove into the Brisket Bibimbap and Filipino BBQ St. Louis Ribs.I'll make it short and sweet; the platters were verging between lukewarm and cold.  It was lunchtime and no other customers were around to slow down things, so I'm not sure as to why it would be that way.  The twist on everything was OK; it didn't wow me.  I'm Filipino and the ribs did not taste like street BBQ.  It was rather two-dimensional and too salty.  I will say though the brisket was top notch, other than it being cold; tender and smoky.  Much of the rice, plain and fried, was hard and crunchy.  Huge disappointment there, even if it's just a side.  Really looked forward to this place and was excited that they're planting down in the community of fast food, 7-11's and too many taquerias, but was underwhelmed by the lack of attention to detail.  Unfortunately, it's a tough transition from fave food truck to brick and mortar and many fail.  I believe that if they worked on these and really nail it, they could be as successful as Smoque is.I'll leave it at that.  Have yet to try the chicken and will go back for it.  Everyone deserves a second chance."
"Not traditional BBQ by any means. More of an Asian spin on their take of 'cue. Definitely an unexpected surprise! Had the Smoked brisket, tiger cry sauce. Not slaw, grilled Texas toast, and one of my favorite sides; toasted garlic rice. Found this place while getting to my haircut early, definitely check this place out!"
"This review is not to write about the food at Smalls, which was great.  But, this is to tell people about an experience my friend and I just had there.  My friend came in from the west suburbs to catch up, enjoy a meal, and to drink some beers.  He heard about Smalls and Half Acre brewery, on Lincoln, from Yelp.  It just happens that Half Acre allows you to bring food in; which was perfect.  So, we stopped by Smalls and ordered Half dark chicken and Filipino BBQ, and the friendly cashier convinced us to add on an order of the rice balls.  To my dismay, the order took longer than usual, with other customers that came after us getting theirs filled.  I told this to the cashier and she said that there was an order mixup and it will soon be up.  Needless to say, I was a bit upset.  The chef/owner heard the conversation and came up to me and apologized and said that they accidentally cooked half white meat, instead of half dark meat.  He adamantly apologized and said that he would not charge us because of the mistake that was made and the long delay.  He gave me the food and promised that the charge would be removed from the credit card.  So, my friend and I headed out to Half Acre, which was at least 10-15 minutes away.  Our experience of Smalls, from that point, was of disappointment.  It was nice that the chef/owner was going to credit us for the meal, but it was a not a good first impression. As we sat down at Half Acre, ordered our multiple beers to try, we were excited to sample the Smalls' food that we patiently waited for.  As we opened up our bag and laid the food on the table, to our disappointment we noticed the rice balls that the cashier sold us on were not there.  My friend and I looked at each other and just sighed.....another restaurant bites the dust, we thought.  We were starved by this time; so, we just started eating the rest of the meal we order.  It was fantastic.  We kept saying that if it wasn't for the other mistakes, it would be perfect.As we were finishing our meal, drinking more beers, and catching up on each other's life, we were caught off guard...... Lo and behold, Joaquin Soler, the chef/owner of Smalls, comes walking into Half Acre with a bag in his hand.  Our jaws dropped when he told us that he tracked us down by asking the cashier where we were headed.  She thought it was either Revolution or Half Acre.  That is frigging unbelievable, I didn't even remember mentioning it to the cashier.  And, in the bag he was carrying was the forgotten rice balls, with just extra home made cookies.......can you believe that.   THAT IS BEYOND CUSTOMER SERVICE.  I told Joaquin, I had good service before, but nothing like that.  I own my own business and I believe in treating people the way I want to be treated; .but, this man went beyond that......... he's treating people the way you want them to treat your grandmother.   I couldn't let this kind of service go untold. I always say that you can't tell a person's character when things are going well.....it's when it goes bad, does the true self come out.   Smalls will be successful because Joaquin Soler has great character and he treats his food and his customers like gold.  Thank you Joaquin for a memorable evening."
"I have been fortunate to have had some pretty amazing BBQ. And before last night, my favorite ribs were in a BBQ joint in Memphis Tennessee. That is before I had a sampling of  the ribs and chicken and brisket and pulled pork from smalls. I can now officially say I have a new rib standard by which to measure all BBQ by....Smalls smoke shack in Chicago!I've read the other reviews and if you love BBQ, you will love this place, and if you only like BBQ, then you will come to LOVE this place. And I met the whole crew including the Co-Owner/Chef and his business partner and what a great team! They prepare each meal as it is ordered and there is great collaboration on getting the presentation and details just perfect. What a culinary treat to enjoy my food overlooking the kitchen and watch other orders being prepared. And the surprises of the evening were the corn which was so stellar, and the hand cut fries with Banana Catsup. What a Crazy good invention!  This place was worth the combination train/bus/skateboard ride from downtown to get to and if you miss this place while visiting Chicago (or if you live on Chicago,just go!!!) you have missed, in the immortal words of fellow Chicagoan Gene Siskel ""a small treasure""!!!Smalls is in fact.....GIGANTIC BBQ! Not to be missed."
"Best bbq I've had in a long time!  Actually dare I say it??  It's the best BBQ I've ever had!!!  Yes it's that good, traditionally smoked, but ethnically seasoned. If you like good food, You have to try it ! Want more specifics? Read The the rest of the reviews. Only down side is it's limited seating."
"Last weekend, the mister drove past this tiny place, tucked in next to Lizard Lounge in a forgotten corner of Albany Park.  ""Claire!"", he exclaimed. ""Fried chicken and ribs!""  Yeah, I've heard that song and dance before and have often been left unimpressed.  But, in an effort to support a neighborhood joint, I gave it a go for carry out on a rando Tuesday night.  Here's what I have to report back to the masses:First off, the place is tiiiiiiny, so carry out is a good option.  But it smells ohsogood in there, you kinda don't want to leave.  What a conundrum.  We got the 1/2 chicken and a half slab of ribs.  I called in the order, it was ready 20 min later when I got there, it cost about $26, the order was HUGE, and it traveled well.  I stood outside, wilting in 90 degree heat, waiting for the mister to pick me up for 30 min, and aside from the fries (which were inevitably a little soggy), the food was still delish.Both the chicken and the ribs were amazingly flavorful.  The ribs were chewy, St. Louis-style with a smokey, crusty exterior.  The chicken was extra crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside.  The ribs came with this fried rice, which was probably the best fried rice I've ever had.  It was also smokey with little crispy bits in it.  I'm not a huge rice fan, and I ate this all up.  Both orders came with vinegary pickles and onions called ""Not Slaw"", probably because it's not coleslaw.  Clever.Overall, I would definitely get this to-go again, and would try the other items on their menu.  They've got some brisket bi-bim-bop thingy that sounds amazing.  The only thing I'd ditch would be the fries.  Fries get gross quickly.  Ditch the fries and just offer rice.  That's my $0.02."
Great little spot. BBQ w/an Asian flare. I'll be back.
"Had the brisket and pulled pork. Brisket was super tender and had a nice crust, Tiger Cry Sauce was dynamic and complimented the meat very well. Admittedly I'm not a huge pulled pork fan, theIr pork was tender and pulled right apart, I enjoyed that it wasn't shredded and the bean sauce was nice. The five spice French fries were nice and the banana ketchup, while interesting, was a bit off putting but that's more a personal preference not so much an admonishment of the product. The gentleman at the counter was very helpful and polite. I will most assuredly return to try some other offerings."
"The ribs were amazing.  Lately Chicago is getting away from baby-backs, thank god, but many places serve St. Louis style ribs that don't have the tips.  These spare ribs with the tips were incredible.  The pull.  The taste. The smell.  The size.  So good."
Wow. The fried chicken here is amazing. It's not often that you get a chicken breast that drips juice after you cut into it. And the skin? Crispy and spicy. Order more food than you think you can eat at one sitting - the fried chicken is just as good cold the next morning for breakfast.Bring a friend and have her get the bibimbap (brisket with chili paste) - and upgrade the steamed rice to garlic rice. Mix that stuff up and enjoy the explosion of flavors in your mouth.Go next door to Lizard's to wash this all down with a beer.
"2 Stars for the Ribs / 5 Star fried Chicken / 5 star serviceI came in a few weeks ago and decided to give the place a whirl. The fried chicken definitely lived up to its billing.   Buttermilk-brined with a very nice (I'm guessing)  corn flake or ground panko crust.   The cook time was about 20 minutes, which is normal for large pieces of chicken. But, maybe the owners should consider investing in a pressure fryer or broaster to cut cook times nearly in half.   The ribs on the other hand were disappointing.   It was marinated in fish sauce which made the pork extremely salty.  I feel fish sauce, while it has its own merits. should be somewhat sparingly when used with smoked meats.   Smoking imparts a natural meatiness / savoriness, but doesn't really go well with savoriness of the fish sauce.  It just tasted really weird to me.   Maybe cut down on the fish sauce and use salt instead?  (I'm a chef, so this is my genuine opinion)  In addition, the ribs really could've benefited from a sweeter type of sauce.   I personally, don't know much about Filipino food, but I really think the ribs would've been outstanding with a tamarind based sauce which naturally goes well with pork.   Also, the amount of the meat on the ribs was quite generous, but with the ribs tips still attached to the ends made it very difficult and messy to separate the ribs from each other.   I had to use my 8-inch chef's knife to hack the ribs apart.   I will, most likely, come back to try to Brisket and Bibimbap.   The fried chicken is a no brainer  :) The staff was friendly too."
"When people are waiting in line on a Saturday afternoon for Fried Chicken, you know the Chef/owner is doing something right. Very small place on a side street, but well worth the trip. Very crispy and moist Fried Chicken that requires no additional hot sauce/seasonings. Pair that with their house fries and banana ketchup and its love at first bite!"
"Wow! So tasty and the staff are very welcoming--on the phone and in person. I really appreciate being teated like a valued customer. Thank you Smalls!We tried most of the menu and thoroughly enjoyed it all. The stand-outs were the pork, chicken, and garlic rice. Amazing. I really loved the brisket Bi Bim Bop but my cohorts weren't as thrilled (trust me though, it's a great twist on a Korean favorite.) The way they balance the heat and flavors in each dish is genius--you definitely need the plain rice with the heat of the Bi Bim Bop, and the fries go great with the fried chicken. Yum!It's obvious that lots of thought and care goes into the food at Smalls. Go, eat."
"Ok, I've been going here for awhile now and their food has really dropped off.  They've also had some weird hours of when they were open.Anyway, the food -  the rice used to be white and garlic infused and really tasty.  Now it is reddish and definitely not as good.  Their pork/brisket/ribs also are drier now.  Did they get new chefs or something?  I didn't recognize anyone in there last time I was there.  C'mon Smalls!  If it doesn't go back to how it was, I'm going to have to go elsewhere for my BBQ."
"I got here and the ribs were all sold out. Sad face. 3.5 Stars It was definitely good. But overall it wasn't anything special, it needed just a a lil more of a push. Love the Filipino/Asian influence on their dishes. The Elotas was very good but that was because of the Spicy Japanese Mayo and the corn combo, the corn was very sweet but it could have used more cheese and cilantro.The Fried Chicken was very Juicy, hot and cooked fresh. Their breading was crunchy and had its own unique flavor. Very good fried chicken, but needed a lil more spice in the breading. The fries also had an Asian twist to its seasoning which I liked alot.The garlic fried rice was good. The rice was subtle in its garlic flavor, but yet it had pockets of where it was strong. I preferred the latter. I got it by itself to try it, so if i had it with any of the main dish I could imagine the rice going well with it. A solid, solid place I would definitely drop by if i was around here next time to get more of my Asian Fusion fixing and try the ribs."
"""Seriously, just look for the teal shack."" Probably a good move on Smalls part to paint the exterior such a bright color, or we may never have found it. On a Friday night, the boyfriend and I went in search of some delicious BBQ, I had basically promised him the world by saying the words ""brisket bibimbop."" My rating comes from the fact that I knew what to expect. I knew there was no seating and that I was going to eat my food in an offbeat bar, but I kind of love weird situations like this...and I love brisket.Upon finding street parking and entering Smalls, we perused the small menu and went with the brisket bibmbop and the brisket platter. As we paid, the man ringing us up signaled to another staff member and let us know he would be bringing our food next door, to the Lizard Lounge. We paid and went next door to the quirkly Lizard Lounge. Dinner time on a Friday night and the place was filled with regulars having a few beers. Non-pretentious and an older crowd, we ordered a couple Stellas ($4 special on Friday nights) and easily found a table. A few minutes later, the Smalls delivery man came through the back door of the bar with our food. I started with the brisket bibimbop which was incredibly flavorful, definitely not your traditional bibimbop. Seriously, don't expect regular Korean bibimbop. I absolutely loved the garlic rice that served as a base and the pickled vegetables you could add. I ended up switching half-way with the boyfriend and liking the brisket platter a bit better! I think the intense flavors of the bibimbop were too much for me. The slices of smoked brisket in the platter were hearty and juicy. It went really well with the garlic rice, ""not slaw,"" and elotes. The spicy tiger cry sauce that came on the side added awesome flavor. We also split a side of fries with their banana ketchup. The boyfriend insisted he couldn't taste the banana, but I liked the flavors in this unique condiment. Overall, I'll be back to try the ribs and chicken (the table next to us said it's a ""must order""). I truly love what Smalls is doing, they obviously care about the dishes they're producing and it's definitely a unique spot!"
we came and ordered take outfried chicken - dry and flavorless!not impressed!
