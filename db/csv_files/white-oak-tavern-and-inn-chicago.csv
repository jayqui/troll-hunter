White Oak Tavern & Inn
"Awesome crispy pork.  This place has wonderful ambiance, great food (they source from Chicago's own Local Foods), and really superb service.We were there with 8 of us.  The noise level of the place was fine so we could talk even down the table.  I mentioned the superb service... it felt like they were trying to serve each person exactly what they requested.  Right touch, not pushy, but understanding."
"What a cute date spot! My significant other and I went there yesterday for an impromptu date night. Plates are all shareable, not just a one or two bite a person either - plates are surprisingly big! I strongly recommend the half chicken with green beans. All the flavors were thoughtfully paired and everything was so fresh. Love the farm to table concept. The interior was very cozy but we opted for the outdoor patio.Shout out to our server Caitlin - I forgot my leftovers at the table and she ran out to catch us at the car. Would definitely go again."
"They have Aleppo pepper on their Bloody Marys!  That's one image of the careful attention to taste styling at White Oak.  That's the feeling I get--taste styling.On a perfect summer day, a wonderful Saturday morning, we opened their restaurant, being the first to arrive at 10 a.m. (opening time).We ordered the Benedict and the Buttermilk waffle.The waffle was exquisite, delectable, heavenly!  An order again, time and again sort of thing.The Benedict was more of a variation--instead of an English muffin, sourdough bread; instead of Canadian bacon, traditional bacon (local source and good)--with a very nice side of greens to contrast the flavors.  The Hollandaise had a noticeable lemon flavor as opposed to vinegar as the ingredient offered in other presentations elsewhere.Recommendation: if you can, order the potato wedges.  Cut in perfect proportion, salted and accompanied by a white cheese sauce and chili ketchup.  Perfect for two.What about the Bloody Mary you ask?  The 'insert' is a pickle and it works perfectly.  A slight vinegar (pleasant spice) taste and the spice mix results in a very, very enjoyable 'adult drink'.  'Adult drink' was the humorous description our server used when first inquiring as to what we would like to drink.While we ate outside, the inside looks spacious and comfortable.  So go and taste-style with the food stylists!"
"Its fine dining prices with a casual dining atmosphere. The food we had was outstanding, and I think you're paying for the ingredients and extra effort, but too fussy. For example when he described the preparation for the pork chop special it had like 20 steps. So when you want to get some dishes for sharing with your two friends you're hoping that they're sharable sizes. It doesn't have to be Maggiano's portions but you know, more than 1 slice of bread for the smoked trout (or at least cut it so it looks bigger LOL) That being said the smoked trout was so delicious. And we also tried the pulled mozzarella which was sublime! I can see that other reviewers needed more bread with that one and we were the same. Its a nice bowl of cheese and a slice, maybe a slice and a half of bread. I had the only pasta dish. I'm sick of kale salad and if you're having a grain salad well then you may as well just eat pasta (right?!) The fish options were lake fishes which I avoid because I hate a ""fishy"" flavor - if that makes sense. The pasta was delicious but not $22 delicious. Maybe I'm missing something. There weren't any truffles on it. My friend got the burger which also when described had like 20 steps for the burger and 25 steps for the buns. He seemed to enjoy it. I don't know if it comes with the fries or if they were extra but we shared the fried potato wedges. The potatoes themselves were fine but the house-made ketchup and aioli were insanely delicious. My friend got the grain salad and it looked to be ok. She enjoyed the fresh mint in it. I ordered a Manhattan and it came on the rocks in a Mason jar. Without a fancy cherry which really bummed me out. This was my first time ever having a Manhattan on the rocks, and the last. Had I known...My friend got an old fashioned which was tasty, and my other friend got the whiskey drink made with the blueberry liqueur. It was very yummy.For dessert we tried the cookies and the fruit tart. Both excellent. The tart was like a slice of summer. But the cookies with the milk jam! Wow. They come out like little cakes, all hot and gooey. The jam is like condensed milk in a very good way. Very unique and I would come back just for that."
"The food here is REALLY REALLY good.  The brunch waffle is nothing short of amazing. Everyone in our party enjoying their food. I so wanted to give this place 5 stars but the service here left much to be desired. The staff weren't rude or anything like that, everyone was actually pretty nice, they were just very slow and inattentive. Our sever had virtually no follow up, he never even asked if would like our drinks refilled. Our tea came with no spoon or sugar, and they both took way too long for us to receive them. Same deal for trying to get some syrup too. All in all we enjoyed the food and I would have no problem eating here again."
"Made last minute reservations here for a weeknight dinner date last week.  I think they just started doing online reservations because the host told us we were the first to book through OpenTable (no OT points though, boo). Stepping inside, I wasn't wowed by the bar area.  It was fine, but nothing extraordinary. Walking back into the more formal dining space though was beautiful.  The DECOR was simple, clean, and very cozy. It had a neighborhood feel but slightly upscale and definitely more romantic. Started off with some COCKTAILS which were good, not bad, not great.  I played it safe and had an Old Fashioned which was average.  My bf ordered The German and that was delicious - bourbon, earl grey and blueberries. YUM.  Really light and refreshing.For food, we ordered the house charcuterie, grilled ramps, burger and wedge fries - shared everything.  At first I didn't think it'd be enough food but to be honest, everything on the menu was pricier than anticipated so we refrained from over-ordering.  It's good we held back though because it ended up being the perfect amount for the 2 of us.  The house CHARCUTERIE was my favorite. The duck prosciutto is SO flavorful and the fried bread on the board is awesome.  The BURGER was surprisingly lean-tasting but still juicy and perfectly cooked for me - medium rare.  It went well with the aged cheddar, aioli and pickles but I think the bun they used (I was told it was made in-house) was too soft for my liking and the meat itself is a little on the bland side flavor-wise.  Server spoke highly of the wedge FRIES which I guess they soak overnight then double or triple fry.  They were good but honestly didn't taste too different than any other wedge fry I've had before and I wouldn't pay $6 again for them.  Grilled RAMPS were seasonal and went really well with whatever sauce they used and topped with toasted walnuts.  Still, it's a plate a veggies and I think it was around $14 for this dish - a bit more than I had expected.Overall, the experience was good but not as compatible with the $$$ point.  I'd recommend trying it if you're in the area and since I live nearby, I may be back again when I'm feeling fancy."
"Had a pretty good experience here. I'd rate it 3.5 stars if I could. My friends and I shared a bunch of small plates for dinner. Highlights included the biscuits, the kale salad, the prosciutto/cheese board, and the truffle spaghetti. The carrots were just okay and the tartare was meh. Drinks were good: I liked the wine flight option, but thought glasses of wine weren't very generous pours overall. The chocolate cake was oh so good. Ambiance was nice: so dark you could barely read the menu, but cozy. Price was a good value. A few things annoyed me, though: one, there are like four doors to this restaurant and only one was in use, and the others all look operational and don't have signs on them saying ""please use other door,"" so I was running around like an idiot for a few minutes just trying to enter the damn restaurant. When I did walk in, I stood at the hostess station for a good five minutes without being greeted, even though some of the managers were standing nearby chatting and clearly saw me. One of my friends had to come out from the back dining room to show we where our table was. Our server was efficient but annoying, and every single staff member thrust dishes dangerously close to my face when reaching around me to put things on the table. No ""excuse mes,"" etc. I'm amazed I didn't get hit. Some better manners would be nice. The rudeness of the staff dampened an otherwise great dining experience."
"Went for a girls dinner last night and got a table out on the sidewalk, they have quite a few outdoor tables, which is nice.  Though the tables along Webster are totally on a slant towards the street, so we had to constantly watch our glasses from sliding away, they should do something to even out the tables.  I love the concept of all the food being locally sourced, sustainable, etc etc. and I know that comes at a price, but for the price and small size of all the dishes, I feel like it was just ok.  Reading the menu, there weren't a ton of things that stood out to me that I really wanted to try, which is a bit disappointing, I feel like most places I go I'm always trying to decide b/w a number of things.  We had the following:- Stracciatella - this was very good and they brought extra bread as needed, which was nice- Grain salad - this was pretty good, the dressing was almost like a salsa, the salad was just mostly the grain though, think it was barley?  and small size- Kale salad - definitely would not order this again, it was seriously a small portion of mixed greens and like a dusting of breadcumbs and maybe three tiny goat cheese crumbs.  And it cost $14.  Totally not worth it.- Green beans - These were definitely my favorite thing we had, they were slightly pickled and then like almost grilled or something.  Really interesting and tasted great- Rainbow trout - Not a big fan of this at all, the trout had really strong lake flavor and the puree that it was on was not super flavorful.  The menu makes it sound like there are a bunch of vegetables accompanying it, but really it was some pea tendrils on top and that's about it.  Again, small size for the price.So while some of the food was pretty good, overall I wasn't too blown away by any flavors and the menu overall isn't that interesting.  Service was fine, we were having a nice slow dinner so we weren't too bothered about it, not that friendly, but totally fine.  It was a nice atmosphere, but given what you get for the prices, probably not somewhere I would be too quick to return to..."
"Farm to table sharing plates concept well executed. Range of dishes from hand cut fries with chili sauce to panzanella to trout.  Good selection of cocktails, non-alcoholic sodas and beers.  Servers were quirky and attentive.  I liked the decor throughout the restaurant - rustic, shabby chic of sorts. The front bar area with the hairs by the window would be ideal. The back area doesn't have quite the same feel, so I'd ask to be seated in one of the front rooms if I went again."
"I'm between 3 and 4 stars on this one.  White Oak is super cute and romantic, a great date place.  They definitely spruced it up a lot from John's place.  We didn't make a reservation and they were able to get us in right away.  The service was good too.  Downside, It is pretty expensive for what it gives you.  The menu isn't extensive by any means.  You really are limited on options.  For an appetizer we got the Stracciatella, it's basically cheese and bread for $14.  I mean I feel that is expensive. For 2 people, 1 appt , 2 entrees and 2 drinks over $100.  I think that's a bit high, we aren't in River North, it's Lincoln Park.  I enjoy a good meal but White Oak is priced a bit obnoxiously I would say.  Also I got the burger and it was just so-so.  I would go back for ambiance and drinks but maybe if they have happy hour deals."
"This place is an embarrassing ripoff. They should be ashamed. We went for brunch this past Sunday. We had two burgers, and because the burgers don't come with anything, one order of wedges (there are only five in an order) and one Bloody Mary. Our total was $63. Utterly outrageous."
"Randomly stopped here for brunch with two friends on Saturday.Really beautiful restaurant - I felt like I was eating inside Restoration Hardware.The waiter explained that the plates were meant to be shared. So we ordered the waffle, the egg and brioche plate, and the biscuits, plus a latte, mimosa and beermosa.The drinks were good (although they forgot the latte` but they brought it out quickly once we pointed it out).The waffle was delicious, one of the best I've had in awhile.  The only problem was that it was the size of a normal waffle, but it was $12 instead.  And yeah it was delicious, but for that much money and with being told it was shareable we were disappointed.The soft scrambled eggs were odd.  And again, for a shareable plate it came with one slice of brioche.  One.  How was this meant to be shared with the table? The bacon (which wasn't really bacon) and sausage were great.The biscuits were delicious (again, for 8 dollars I think there should have been more).Overall, the food is good but they either need to reduce the prices or increase the portions because not one of those were actually good for splitting up with people.Prices were also high for what you get."
"The homemade pasta is always delicious, and the burger is as well. It's a great neighborhood spot with a nice ambiance!"
"LOVED my trip to White Oak and can't stop recommending it to friends. Snacks, dinner, dessert and cocktails were all delicious. Would definitely recommend the burger!! Something for everyone on the menu and the menu is locally sourced and food is prepared in house. Great spot for a cute, casual but memorable date. Stop by Sweet Mandy B's next door for desserts for the next day."
"We go to brunch every Sunday after mass.  It was my birthday this week and I got to pick the place.  White Oak Tavern had been on my dinner list, so I bumped it up to brunch and we headed to Lincoln Park!Been a long time fave of Johns Place, and living in North Center we visit the Roscoe Village location often.So it was very nice to see John sitting and smiling in the front of the space when we walked in.  He gave us a friendly, ""I think I kinda recognize you guys"" smile and walked over to welcome us.  So lovely. The space was all sorts of adorable, and we were quickly seated at a round table (why aren't there more of these at restaurants?).  We were then greeted by our lovely waiter Matthew.  He was happy, patient and very helpful. The waffles were a big hit, and my mother couldn't stop talking about the soft scrambled eggs!  I ordered an asparagus number because I was craving greens (have to jump on that when the rare occasion occurs!) and was very happy.  Matthew brought out a few of the daily pastries with a candle for my birthday :) (nice touch).  Additionally when my mother was still rambling on about the eggs, Matthew introduced us to the chef.  Super cool.  My Dad said to Matthew ""It's very clear that you are man who enjoys your job'.  He was right and Matthew made our experience all the more enjoyable because his positive energy was contagious!Wish it was up in my hood - but a wonderful reason to get back to that sweet LP neighborhood - next time I want to try dinner!"
"We were really excited to try this place out. We came in on Saturday for a reservation for 2 and they sat us at a tiny table in the main dining area- one table by the window that was much smaller than the rest. We asked to have a normal table for 2 since the restaurant was half empty (it was 6:15 PM) but they said they were completely booked. The manager was extremely snooty with us and left us with an extremely bad taste to start the night. Not only was the restaurant half empty, they were rude to us, and we had to sit facing all those empty tables.The waiter was really friendly and passionate about the food- total 180 from management. We ordered some dishes and tried to forget about the earlier snootiness. We ordered the burger and it arrived extremely red on the inside- I was worried it was raw, I'd never seen such a rare burger. Otherwise it tasted ok but for $15, I expect more than a normal sized hamburger...there were no sides, sauces, and it was not a shareable size. The swiss chard salad was basically leaves and heavy dressing.About an hour into dinner, still the restaurant was empty and another manager came over to separate more tables...reservations hadn't shown up and instead of seating guests who were there, they were snooty. The manager heard our exasperation and came over to make us feel even worse by patronizing our concern and being condescending. ""Oh! You don't like the the french bistro table?"" No- it's small, and it wasn't about the table- it was about the rudeness. She brought over a glass of champagne on the house but I could tell from her demeanor that she thought we were being unreasonable.If this restaurant wants to survive in Chicago they need to come back down to earth and understand the value of customer service and distaste for snobbery. The only silver lining was our waiter."
"My boyfriend took me here for my birthday this year and it was one of the eat meals we've ever had. The duck board alone would have made for a really memorable, indulgent meal. But we also had an incredible array of vegetable dishes made with veggies that had been pickled and then roasted, which was such an unexpected but delicious combination. The service was also impeccable and our waiter, Matt B., took excellent care of us, suggesting and explaining dishes and recommending cocktail pairings. And when I wasn't crazy about the desert I ordered (a panacotta that to me tasted strangely like pizza) Matt had the chef send out an entirely new desert (a chocolate mousse with fresh citrus) that was fantastic. I can't wait to go back, next time the opportunity presents itself."
"White Oak is a gem -- it is an elegant neighborhood restaurant with stunning food.  We were lucky enough to get an outdoor table over this magnificent weekend.  Our server was funny and engaging and led us to some delicious choices.  We began with the prosciutto and cheese plate (wow), the smoked trout salad, fried mushrooms and some delicious bread and cheese appetizer.  All amazing.  The trout was so good we ordered another one. The wine list was fabulous, and the cocktails were strong.  That led us into a delicious dinner -- the half chicken was rhapsodic -- truly good chicken is a rare delight -- and this was so well cooked.  The burger was beautifully presented with house cured pickles and onions.  Our only knock is that the burger had a bit of a lamb or gamey flavor.  Some of us loved that, others were looking for a beefier flavor.  It was a totally delightful evening.  We feel lucky that White Oak has come to our neighborhood and plan to go back as often as possible!"
"I don't understand the 5 stars given to this place at all. Always on the lookout for a new brunch spot, we gave this one a try today, a Saturday. The red flags should have been enough to put us off: half empty (even the really bad brunch spots in Chicago have a line on Saturdays), and the uninspiring menu. While I won't waste my time describing the menu details, I have a few comments that might shed light on why I am never going back. Firstly, if you're going to serve coffee, you better serve a choice of milks. Only whole milk (no 2% or any non-dairy options) served here. My husband's bagel came so smothered in grease that when pressing the bread down, little geysers of oil came spurting out of the bread. I'm pretty sure my wholemeal toast was in fact, a brioche of some kind, masquerading as wholemeal. Shady. If you want eggs cooked any style, be prepared to order it as a side dish, here. My eggs were perfectly poached. However, I had to order them as a side dish, in a sad little pot. It's a shame really. The bacon was literally drowning in a sticky, greasy, sickly sweet gunk. I have given one star because the Bloody Mary was in fact, excellent and the owners have sourced their ingredients from respectable farms and other purveyors. The decor is pretty and the music was a good choice. My eggs were perfectly poached. Tea and coffee is of high quality. What a shame the chef decided to make perfectly edible ingredients, inedible. In his defense, it's not the only place in Chicago that messes with good ingredients to the point where you don't even taste the main ingredients, because they get smothered in toppings, sauces and other gunk that comes on top of them. It's an epidemic in this city. Most of all, please don't try and trick me when it comes to bread. Unforgivable."
"Let's let the Buzzing begin...This is the best new restaurant in ChicagoThey never got high profile 'Hot' (although they were always sold out) but any who attended the epic Sunday Dinners at the late, great Panozzo's Italian Market down in the South Loop (or savored the perfect Lasagna Bolognese, or devoured a Meatball sandwich in the alley behind the shop before they had seats) knows that White Oak's chef John Asbaty can cook circles around just about anybody. I was a Regular then and, despite the longer hoof, I'm going to be a regular now. The kid has a fine dining shingle and you can now experience his fare nightly. I dined early in the new joint's tenure...my kick-off tequila-based cocktail 'The Auctioneer' was stellar (worthy of having the word 'craft' attached) the biscuits were simply, instantly iconic...could have and would have eaten a bushel of them. The charred cabbage salad was kinda perfect, balanced...seasonal and just right (all great cooks are obsessed with vegetables)But I want to talk about the Beef Shoulder (Coppa)...I had to know so I asked 'How is this prepared? John takes a cut of meat you would typically braise, cooks it sous vide for the better part of a day (recipe evolving but the waiter said 18 hours) and then treats it like a steak...puts it in a pan with oil for 'Side One'...flips it, adds butter, thyme...browns and spoons the butter over the steak...Shazam...essentially Hobo Steak (with that great sear and depth) with the mouthfeel of Prime Rib or Short Ribs. It shouldn't be possible...but it is. The dessert cookies were stupidly good. Just go. It will be far more dramatic than my description."
"I haven't been this excited about a place in a long, long time!The food is exceptional. All farm-to-table, so what you get is fresh and it shows. The carrots and cabbage are to die for, as is the duck platter. I could eat a bucket of the duck liver mouse and not care what I looked like in a swim suit come summer!I was there on a Thursday for the first time and then quickly made a reservation for Friday the next day. Both meals were different but both were wonderful.DON'T go in thinking you are going to eat the same way you usually do in a restaraunt. DO select things you would like to share so you can enjoy many. Think of it as a hearty, big plate,  midwestern tapas with a great beer list, attentive service, and better music.Run there. Seriously. Because I'm already calling for another reservation."
"Great farm-to-table dining experience!The decor is very homey and orderly, with couches, single chairs, and tables for dining spread throughout. A gas fireplace warms the dining area in the back. There's a communal table, just in front of the Chef's space. Wedge Fries: double-fried, perfectly salted, and bite-sized. Good for 1-2 people.Grain Salad: Dill, mushrooms, cranberries, beets... needless to say more.Seasonal Vegetable Tartare: This was my least favorite item, but good nonetheless. Basic, simple vegetables with fried bread, tartare, and a raw egg atop it all. Beef Burger: Delicious! Probably my favorite burger meat I've had thus far. The meat is delivered medium-rare, with a butter-like texture that melts in your mouth, and a succulent taste you've only dreamt. The Butterkase and aged cheddar, onions, and house-made bun were tasted in every single bite. #WinCoffee: La Colombe is their house roast! Very good!Service was excellent! Our server was incredibly sweet, and occasionally made his way, with much-welcome, into our conversations. Interesting, and insightful personality. John, the owner, was also very affable, and made the experience that much more enjoyable, with his frequent check-in's, and restaurant conversations he sparked. Great, light-eating, spot! Great conversion from the previous 'John's' that occupied this space."
"Great food, drinks, and staff; but please get wifi, ice cream, olives, and orange bitters."
"Everything I tasted was fantastic and the decor was beautiful. However, I found the wine pours to be notably stingy. Had it not been for that I would have given 5 stars."
"Good food BUT the worst kitchen to table imaginable. Brought my wife's dish - not wanting food to get cold, she went ahead and ate. My dish arrived 3 minutes after her plate had been cleared. Really fun watching each other eat. Will NEVER return."
"Went to White Oak for an early Saturday dinner and had a great time. The decor is very homey: couches, cushioned chairs, chandeliers, candles, fireplace, and the music was perfect (lots of easy listening oldies from the 70's-80's; ex: Dancing in the Moonlight). The food was exceptional and the service was on-point. After a long day of walking around the city it was the perfect spot to wind down and enjoy a great meal. Seems like a good spot for a group as well. The head chef, John, came to our table and chit-chatted with us for a few minutes and really brought the experience full circle. We will be back again!What we ordered:Kale SaladBeef ShoulderLots of Wine"
"Seriously the best meal I have had in a long time!! Crispy pork, biscuits and grain salad are a must try for starters. Tonight we had the burger and abalone mushrooms. So incredible. Chef John knows how to do a burger right and I have never had anything like those mushrooms in my life. It was like a delicious mushroom steak with an incredible sauce. We barely saved room for dessert but glad we did-  the cookies and jam are just warm delicious awesomeness and the tres leches cake was so incredible. Best part of the dining experience is you can tell how fresh the food is- and how much passion the chefs put into creating a great dish every time. I would recommend this place to anyone! You won't be disappointed!"
"My husband and I were so excited to try this place since we live in the neighborhood, but we were very disappointed when we came in for drinks and dessert.The Good-Ambiance & Decor- fantastic, very cozy and intimateThe Bad-- Drinks- I'm surprised, because they gave us a libations menu, so I was super excited and expected a great hand crafted cocktail...but, when I ordered a whiskey sour, it tasted like something from a juicebox. The waiter mentioned they use local liqueurs...this whiskey must not have been aged it all, it was terrible.- Butter Cake- As a huge fan of the Mastro's buttercake, we were excited to try their version. Unfortunately it tasted nothing like a buttercake-it actually tasted like and looked like banana bread. Wasn't terrible, but nothing like what we were expecting.To be fair, we did not have dinner, but based on the fact we disliked the drinks and desserts, we wouldn't go back."
"Formerly John's Place, White Oak Tavern is so delicious.We got:- prosciutto platter- focaccia- crispy porkSo amazing. You may see John, the owner, while you're there. If you're curious, just try it! So good."
"The menu is seasonal and sourced from local farms.  We loved the burger, spaghetti and chicken dishes.  Newly launched Bruch Menu was excellent . . .egg topped Burger!"
Amazing. One of best meals we have had lately in Chicago. The flavors were awesome! Staff was great.
Odd menu.  Very small portions.  Very BIG prices.  Inattentive service.  Never going back.
A group of my friends and I came for brunch and it was one of the worst brunch experiences we have had in Chicago. They say the menu is mean to be shared but it made zero sense. Also the food was awful and our waiter was rude. The whole experience was awkward and disappointing. Definitely missing Johns Place and won't go back.
"I went to White Oak for a fairly early dinner, and ended up staying for three hours.  The food was perfect.  The decor is understated elegance.  I felt like I was at a dinner party, but each guest was collectively seated.  The understated seating doesn't prepare you for what you're about to taste.  I took a chance, and ordered the pickled vegetables, with house made dressing.  They were crunchy, and sweet labors of love, lightly charred, with the right amount of toothiness.  I cleaned my board.  I again, ordered something else on a board, the duck board.  It was righteous.  My duck was still sizzling as my waiter, Alex delivered it to me.  I pierced the skin, and the juices ran out and I began to separate the meat from the bone, and I added little tastes of salad, and duck mousse, and the cherry mustard, to my toasted rye bread, studded with dried fruits.  It was heavenly.  It was like the perfect relationship that affords you the luxury of nuances that you didn't expect, combined with humor, experience, and expertise.The beef shoulder was so tender and juicy.  I asked for a steak knife, and I was politely told by my waiter, that the restaurant does not offer them.  Nevertheless, my table knife, made short work of that cut of beef, and the rest was history.  I ended my meal, with a creme brulee, which was perfectly cooked, and a little loose, which was similar to how French restaurants serve it.  The burnt sugar shell shocked the pear butter, and chocolate piped in rosettes on top of it.  I left feeling very stoned, realizing I had just had the best meal of of my life.Chef John visited my table, and was kind enough to take my creme brulee dish away.  I was such a push over, after three glasses of wine, anyway.  I found him to very earnest, friendly, and low-key.  Taking an understated pride in my response to how much I enjoyed my dinner tonight.  Farm to table is an understatement of what goes on here.  I think this place will be around for a long time, because it doesn't take itself so seriously.  The food is the star.Roberta W. Chicago, Il"
"White Oak gave me one of my best meals of 2014. The decor is cozy and welcoming. The cocktails were perfectly balanced. Every dish wowed.We started with the prosciutto board, and the blueberry compote and cheese provided a perfect complement to some seriously high-quality prosciutto. After our second course, I could not stop marveling at the uniquely delicious combination of beets, mushrooms, cranberries, apples and dill in the fall grain salad. The house made pasta was served with an egg containing a perfectly runny yolk, and after mixing the two together, we were rewarded with a super-savory dish. We ended the meal with the whole roasted rainbow trout with celery root. According to our server, this dish got the chef the job. Easy to understand why. Beautiful plate with awesome flavors.White Oak is a must-try. As suggested by another reviewer, plan on sharing. You can't taste enough of this food."
"I showed up to the restaurant on time for my reservation for 4 people at 7pm on a Saturday. They sat us at a community table in front of the open kitchen. We requested another table, reminding them we had a reservation and the host rudely told us that they fill up months in advance and that was the best they could do even though there were open tables in the dining area that stayed vacant the entire time we were there. This was very disappointing. Make sure you ask what kind of table you're getting when you make the reservation so you're not getting smoked out and talked over during your meal. I will say the food was excellent but due to the experience, still 2 stars. They also have an incredibly limited wine and beer selection."
"Amazing. Atmosphere, service, food...all incredible. We had the trout and pork entrees. Both were mouth watering. Our server was very knowledgable and the hostess was all smiles. Visiting from out of town...made my stay in chi town very enjoyable."
"I had the pastrami and hash with a side of sourdough bread.  My girl had the burger and potato wedges.  It was awesome!  You can only order the burger med rare which I think is brilliant.  The potato wedges and cheddar cheese sauce that came with it was phenomenal.  It was juicy, meaty, and had the perfect taste of beef to it. Now to my pastrami and hash.  As someone who considers themselves a corned beef and hash connoisseur this was an excellent change up.  The chunks of pastrami and potatoes were perfect and the blueberry jelly that came with the sourdough was so good I wanted to buy a jar of it.  For a cool classy brunch spot in the summer I would give this a big yes please may I have another."
"2.5 stars here.  I have mixed feelings about this place. Like other reviews have said, the food is excellent but the prices are ridiculous. My husband and I had come in for brunch and were pleasantly surprised by how cute the the restaurant is. We were seated by the window and had great service as well.  Hubby ordered the pastrami beef hash (amazing), and I ordered the rhubarb french toast (also wonderful). The problem was that the prices are way too expensive for brunch and the portions are also small. After we finished our food, we were still hungry. We then ordered a salad and split it. The salad was also small but tasted great. So after 3 plates and 2 coffees, our bill arrives.... $50! Not including tip!  I'm sorry but that's just way too much to pay for brunch when no one even ordered an alcoholic beverage! This restaurant needs to reevaluate its prices if they wanna stay open.  I've never paid $5 for a cup of coffee anywhere."
Local Lettuce + Beef Shoulder + Cookies & Milk Jam = Perfect Meal!
