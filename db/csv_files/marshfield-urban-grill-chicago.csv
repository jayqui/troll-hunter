Marshfield Urban Grill
"I started coming here a month ago after a friend recommend it. So far I have been here maybe 5 or 6 times.The layout of the place is cozy. I do like the spacing of the table. Spacious table and then there is nice semi private table at the end of the bar in the back for couple or people wanting some privacy. There is a pool table in the back. They have a jukebox and few TV for sports viewing. The bathroom is clean which is a good sign of the cleanliness of the place and the staff.I do like some of the foods from here. I so far have tried lamb slider, fish taco, chili, mac n cheese, and soft pretzel. I only disliked the mac n cheese and I mentioned it to the bartender. He was very nice to ask me why I don't like it and how he could tell the chef to improve on it. To my surprise this place really listen to the customers and actually made a change. The service here has been consistent. However, I have only met one bartender here. His name is Kevin. I have seen him on Wednesday and Saturday. He was attentive and professional. Made few good cocktails that kept me coming back. I have met the chef also which I think is the owner. She was friendly. Overall, the people that comes here look friendly. I definitely like this place.Warning: Be careful of the speed camera on Clybourn near Marshfield. 30mph limit."
"Super chill neighborhood spot off of Clybourn. They've got some seating on the sidewalk where you can bring your dog and they'll even bring water for your loveable little pet to drink while you do. Hopefully yours doesn't knock it over like mine always does. There's a decent selection of beers on tap, but the food is really where this place shines. The fish tacos were excellent and the french onion soup was on point as well. I'm definitely looking forward to a repeat visit to try the burger after seeing the table next to us with one and getting order envy. The crowd is mostly from the area so you can obviously expect some pretty spot on and friendly service. Likely from one of the owners that is usually behind the bar. Overall it'll be a great place in the summer for lunch or happy hour. I'll be back for sure."
"This place has no ""niche"", but it's overall a very good bar. Came here on a Friday just to check it out and they have a good ambiance going on. They had beer specials on a Friday which is pretty awesome, and we went to ordering food right away. We got fried zucchini with this amazing sauce. The zucchini part was meh, they should serve fried pickles instead with the sauce... it would be awesome.I got the beef, pulled pork and lamb sliders. Pulled pork did nothing for me, the beef was good and the lamb was amazing. If I come back I'm getting the lamb burger for sure.Like I said this place has no ""niche"" and tries to do it all. The food is definitely good, but it doesn't give out a date vibe. They have a random pool table that eats up valuable room and they seemed to have a good selection of liquor. They had a few small TVs for the Bulls game and even surround sound, but it seems to do too much. This could be very valuable as a date place, they just need to get rid of high tables on the side and put in lower tables or cushioned seats.Come here for the food or drink specials."
"Nice, clean, and comfortable bar/restaurant with some character. Bartenders are very friendly and attentive. Fried cauliflower is very tasty."
"Came in here for Burger Week to try the Lamb Burger and it turned out pretty good. Make sure you try the donut holes too. I like the spot, it's not a big place, but it's cozy. We went here on a Tuesday evening so there was hardly anyone there which gave us a chance to shoot some pool."
I just ate the best ramen of my life! And it was takeout! I definitely need to dine in!The soft-boiled egg was cooked (and kept) perfectly considering the time it took for delivery. Pork belly was oh-so tender and dat broth tho! Ahmazing.We also had lemongrass chicken and wagyu beef dumplings which were delicious.
"Would I eat here again? Sure - why not. They serve alcohol and make you wait 90 minutes to get your food so in your drunken and starving state, the food taste delicious. I would definitely work here, as in my over 2 hour dinner I saw the bartender, who is also the waiter, take over over 5 shots of Jameson. But let's be honest, I can go to any bar and get the same food, without having a  waiter who messed up on our orders and took way too long to get us our food. Oh, did I mention? One of the girls I was with ordered a cucumber press, which on the menu comes with vodka-- he brought her the drink made with gin- stating ""that's how the bartender makes it"". Umm? Then why does it say vodka on the menu-- also- you're the bartender. Say ""that's how I make it"" No. No. No."
First visit here last night. Had the cod sliders and my friend had the lamb burger. Excellent! Great beer selection. Cool conversation with the bartender. Will definitely be a place I hang out and bring people. Get the zucchini fritters. Out of this world!
"What a fantastic bar! See Yelp gets me to these places that might not otherwise be on my radar. Out of the 30+ restaurants participating in the Burger Binge Week, this was the only spot offering a lamb burger. I was a little hesitant at first because I know that when I got there they just opened for the day, and I was the first customer in. I sat at the bar and got a very warm welcome from the owner. We had girl talk starting with sports and how boys with maybe too much testosterone like to break things when they get excited. Another patron came in and she got us all talking hockey and offered a shot on the house despite our differing loyalties. It was a very sweet gesture that I had to pass given that I was going to drive, do errands, and not work out that day. The burger size was just the right portion with lots of good meat flavor with the sauce and accompaniments. I got the tots which were good, but boy did I wish I got the sweet potato fries. All the more reason to go back. The prices were reasonable. They have a pool table and it's pretty spacious spot. I wish this bar was closer to my hood."
"I had some gift certificates to the place and when I saw the reviews I thought this would be worth trying. Boy it was worth it.First of all they had some Taco Tuesday thing happening. $2.50/gourmet taco. #betterthanbigandlittles for sure. We got all 3 options, a lamb, a pork and a steak taco and all were very good. I also got two sliders, a lamb and a beef and a side of Brussel sprouts. The sliders were pretty size able for sliders and the Brussel sprouts were good! A good light and healthy side to have which I was thankful for.Needless to say, they also had a pretty good drink menu. My friend tried the trumpeter Pilsener (?) and I had the Kona Big Wave (can you tell I am missing my Hawaii days?). Both were really good! I hadn't ever tried the Kona big wave while I was on the big island and I really liked it! To top it off, everything came out to be $33. That's hard to top... So for sure this is a 4 to 5 star joint. The reviews are on point. I'm not in this area but I will definitely come back to try this again, with or without the certificates! I even attached the pics. Enjoy!"
"Discovered this place while running errands - absolutely LOVED everything!!  We were greeted by the bartender like we were old friends, the owner waited on us herself and made us feel like we were with family!  The decor is very tasteful, and the place is SO clean you could eat off the floor!!But let's face it, you're reading this review to see about the food......and the food was EXCEPTIONAL!  This is not your ordinary bar, nor is this place trying to be trendy by using exotic ingredients!  We started with the hot pretzel which arrived hot, but was fantastic!  It's lightly seasoned, but has the perfect balance of crunchy outside and chewy inside that only the greatest pretzels have.My wife had the fish, bbq, and lamb sliders which were huge and you could mix and match!  The fish would make a terrific fish and chips.  The BBQ pulled pork had a great sauce with just enough heat.  The lamb was the biggest surprise!!  The ground lamb with sauce, tomato, and onion was awesome!  The texture and taste were so unlike any time you've had lamb before!I had the Mac'n'Cheese Burger - WOW!!!!  WOW!!!  WOW!!!  I was very skeptical, but figured it would be worth trying once - now it's my new favorite burger!!  The Mac holds together well, and has some bacon in it which complements the burger perfectly!  The result is a hearty, beefy, creamy wonder - on a toasted bun.  Trust me, there aren't words enough to describe this!  The fries were crisp and perfect as well.The very best part is the mood and atmosphere of the place.  It's cozy and welcoming, you WILL be treated like family here.  Can't say enough good things about the staff - we joked and laughed the whole time we waited for our food.  Bottom line - Why aren't you on your way already??"
"This was our 4th time here.  everything we have had here has been great.   We have tried new items each time,  from delicious musssels, to spicy wings with just enough heat and lots of flavor,  to mouth watering poutine (Fry's with gravy, pulled pork and cheese curds),  and soft pretzels with multiple dippings sauces which were all good.  As for drinks they have lots of craft brews on tap.   My favorite is the left hand nitro milk stout, and my wife has found her new favorite cider here, ciderboys first press.  Service has been prompt and very friendly each time we've been here. Dan the bar tender is great!!Glad to have a great restaurant in the neighborhood west of Ashland since there are not many unless you go all the way to Southport.   We will be coming back regularly."
"I have been coming to this bar since it opened. I just had to post today after reading the review from yesterday. 'Bill' must have gone to a wrong bar, because the two bartenders working were of the highest class! The owner is one of the top bartenders in the city, and has mixed drinks at one of the poshest hotels in town before opening her own (Marshfield). The bartender Kevin is terrific, and makes a mean martini!"
"We met a couple friends at this place on a Wednesday evening.  First impression was that it's a nice, clean little gastropub.  Parking on the street wasn't too bad.  They had $3 beer specials and $.50 wings.  The wings were quite tasty, arrived hot, and had almost a tangy sauce that was a bit spicy, but not overly so.  The sliders had excellent brioche buns (pretzel buns are from the Devil).  The only letdown was the poutine.  The fries seemed under cooked, the cheese curds were lacking, the gravy was plain, and we were put off by the braised ribs that were in with it.We had an enjoyable time, it was quite enough that we could hear each other talk and they had baseball on the tv.  If the place were full I think it would be quite loud though."
Great place. Great food and great staff. Everyone from the owner on down made sure that we had a great experience. Will definitely be going back to try all the food and drinks we didn't get to!
"Great place to watch a game! Good food, local craft beer, daily specials. Plenty of street parking. Bartender,  waitresses  all were friendly and responsive.  Clean tables & bar. Clean (women's) restroom.   Watched NFL playoffs here with friends, Saw neighborhood people pop in for take-out or quick bite. I am 40+ and liked that there was a mix of ages and most were over 25.  Easy to get to--major streets Clybourn/ Fullerton/Ashland. Looking forward to their sidewalk this summer! Until then- craft beer & cocktails at Marshfield!"
"Great food, great server, great ambiance and great company. I went on memorial day evening so the place was dead and it was wonderful to have it to ourselves. I would definitely go again for that juicy lamb burger!"
"I came to marshfield urban grill attempting to grab some food, drink a few beers, and enjoy the hawks game. After trying a couple of other bars in the area that were packed we settled on this place. The reason I say settled is because there are 3 tvs crammed in the far left of the place, not exactly what you'd call viewer friendly. At this point I was so hungry I could look past that. The restaurant at this point was quite slow. We ordered a round of beers that the bartender had to take the order (no server). Once the beers came he took our food order. I ordered a chicken sandwich...pretty hard to mess that up, right? Wrong. The chicken patty itself was small (smaller than the one a friend of mine received) and when I bit into it the first thing I noticed was that it was rubbery. So rubbery in fact that my initial bite was not forceful enough to take a chunk out of it! Upon further inspection I noticed the texture was just off, like they took it directly out of the freezer and nuked it in the microwave. Looks wise it kind of resembled a tilapia filet (kind of slimy). All this after a 30 minute delay with pretty much an empty restaurant. After finishing eating what I could our beer glasses sat empty for what seemed like a lifetime. This is despite a backup waitress coming in and walking past our empty table 3 times. Needless to say I will not be coming to this establishment again. I seriously hope the ""yelp rating"" starts to reflect the true nature of this place. The only credit goes to the bartender for serving tables and tending to a full bar (after it got busy)."
"My friend and I came here right after work on a Monday evening.  It wasn't very busy, but it was still early (5-ish).Service was fast and friendly.  I like the dark wood and cozy ambiance.As for the food, I ordered the sliders - one beef, one pulled pork, and one lamb - as well as a side of sweet potato fries.  I liked the beef and the lamb, but the pull-pork was not what I expected.  It didn't have a lot of sauce and the sandwich was kind of dry and cold.  I guess I'm used to something else having lived in the south before.  The sweet potato fries were good, but you really can't screw those up!My friend ordered one of the burgers which was HUGE.  He inhaled it like he had never seen food before.  I'm guessing he liked it.  :)I think I need to give this place another chance - go on another night and try other items on the menu.  Since I'm in the neighborhood, this will probably happen soon!"
"Great place for a drink and a real good bite of food. For being a bar, this spot actually has a legitimately good menu, although a bit small - make sure to get the sliders! MUG offers four to five different types, (including meatball, beef and lamb) all of which are bursting with flavor. Smaller place, but it was a good atmosphere with solid bar space.Definitely worth a try!"
This place has great service and excellent bar food at reasonable prices.We came here for brunch and felt it was a warm friendly atmosphere and not pretentious.  It is ideal neighborhood hangout for food and drinks.
"Love this neighborhood spot. It's right by our house and always has great food, and super friendly service!"
"Found this place while cruising around Yelp this evening.  Showed good reviews so thought we would try it out.  The food was very good.  We wanted to try several other items on the menu but we decided to wait for our next visit.The poutine, the ribs, pretzel, all was excellent.  The staff was friendly.Owner recommended we try the marguerittas.  Great choice.  I could probably drink these all night.We'll be backI didn't get to post the above a few weeks on my first visit.  Went back again this past weekend.  poutine, sliders, fish tacos and pretzels.  There were 4 of us this time.Here is my concern.  We were there on 2 saturday evenings and we were the only people in there enjoying the food.Is this establishment going to make it?  Am I visiting on the wrong night?  Is it more of an after work/weekday type of place?"
"Was very impressed with this place. My fiancé enjoyed the house sangria and the beer list was decent.The poutine was excellent. Plenty of toppings but didn't leave you feeling really full.The sliders were great, we split one of each. The fish and lamb were especially good.The service was excellent, the owner was chatting us up and she is very nice.We will definitely be back!"
Delicious flash-fried cauliflower starter with yogurt-dill sauce. Poutine with short ribs sounds like a train wreck but goes down well with a Bell's Oberon wheat ale. Also enjoyed the grilled fish tacos and the lamb slider.
"Great service. Walked in and was greeted and complimented by the owner and the bartender suggested some great menu items and drinks. Thoroughly enjoyed all our food, it was reasonably priced, nice atmosphere."
"Vanessa and I are always on the look out for a great neighborhood bar. This place quickly became our favorite. The food is amazing!  We just finished eating the homemade donuts!  Everything has that homemade taste.  The owners always treat us like old friends.  Go, you will love it"
"This bar couldn't have more of a local feel in the big city! I'd leave a photo of our food, but it's already gone ;-) Great customer service and excellent food. Highly recommended."
"A hidden gem which is funny cuz it's right on Clybourn -When you walk in you are greeted by a very cool bar and a very bohemian / Lumineers / Mumford atmosphere.The service is great and the menu is awesome. The owner was very gracious and warm to both my wife and me and my daughter -Seems like it would be an awesome college football bar, Thursday night / night time spot."
"I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch.  The restaurant/bar itself looks very nice, and there is a cool homemade Chicago flag decoration on the back wall.  They had a good beer special on Sunday afternoon.  I really enjoyed the macaroni and cheese and the beet salad.  I also tried a slider, and it was tasty--the bun was probably the nicest slider bun I have ever had.  I saw that there are many vegetarian options on the menu, which is cool.  There are not many gastropubs that offer a serious selection of vegetarian options.  I also liked the music that was playing.  Parking is pretty easy for the area, and it is a short walk from the DePaul campus.  I would be happy to bring my family here and enjoy a good meal, or bring my friends here at night to party.  I am looking forward to my next visit!"
"I have been back twice since my original review. I have tried the mac and cheese burger, poutine, the fish tacos, and the sliders (lamb, pulled pork, and the fish). The poutine and fish tacos are top notch. Everything else was very good. They have specials everyday so come in, try the food, and support this neighborhood gem."
"Love this place! Perfect neighborhood spot in Lincoln Park. The decor is great, food is outstanding its a great place to go with the family. Staff is friendly and nice and the bartender knows quite a bit. Introduced me to a new bourbon that is now my favorite. Can't wait to go back!"
"Good find! Awesome ribs. You wouldn't expect it would be so great just walking by, but yum!"
"Awesome spot, great beer, great wings, great people. In a good neighborhood spot, I will be here all the time."
Great new addition to the neighborhood! The staff was friendly and attentive. We got the mussels and burger and both were tasty. Good beer selection. Comfortable and relaxing atmosphere. They were playing the Blackhawks game with sound. Reasonable prices for the quality and amount of food. I'll be back!
"Since they opened just a short while ago we have gotten carry out once and eaten in once. This place is in my neighborhood and I really want to like it and for it to do well. It is good, but I think there is room for improvement. Carry-out: We got the warm pretzel, poutine, sliders (fish, pulled pork, beef), and beet salad. The things that are meant to be hot could have been hotter, especially the pretzel. We live literally right down the street and my husband waited at the bar for the food so it should have still been warm. The salad was good, but there could have been a few more beets and they could have been marinated more heavily for more flavor. The sliders were good, but on the pulled pork one my husband got some inedible gristly bits.  His favorite was the fish. The poutine was yummy, but the fries are nothing special. They may even have been frozen prior to cooking. The containers for the carry-out were a disappointing - too large for the food and mostly styrofoam. Who still uses that? The containers need to be scaled down and a more environmentally friendly material would be appreciated. Eat-in: We got mac and cheese, fish tacos, and fries. The mac and cheese is really yummy. Very creamy. The fish tacos were good - great portion and I liked the fish and the tortilla. The sauce was a little spicy for me. Next time I will get it on the side. The cabbage was a good addition, but like the beets I wish it was more heavily pickled for more flavor and to offset the spiciness of the sauce. Note - they do not come with anything. Just three yummy tacos. The fries were disappointing - at first we asked for sweet potato fries, but were later told the sweet potato fry delivery had not come that day so they were out. So we switched to regular fries. They just don't have a ton of flavor and I really think they may be from frozen. They need a special seasoning or to be twice fried or something to make them stand out. They are just boring. This place is great looking - they did a nice reno job and a patio is coming shortly. The staff is mostly nice, especially the owner Renata. She is a lot of fun. The woman who I think usually runs the bar was our waitress and seemed a little frazzled, but I am sure that comes with having just opened. I met the chef once, he didn't seem that excited to meet a customer. They have a great bar - lots of options and I like the Bells beer selection. Its also very kid friendly. When we dined in there were three other families with children and everyone seemed happy. Really this is something our neighborhood desperately needs so I really hope they do well, but continue to improve by making the existing menu items as good as they can be and by expanding the menu once they are off and running."
Great new neighborhood spot with a nice beer list and good food.  We came on a weekday and had some drink and food specials.  For food there was a soft pretzel with some yummy sauces that we ordered another one of as soon as we finished the first.  It was like 3 dollars or something silly.  We also got a couple orders of sweet potato fries that were excellent.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating.  Got a nice overall impression of the place and will certainly check it out again.
"Outstanding service, truly above and beyond the call of duty. Great food; terrific drinks. This place is a real gem! A perfect spot when going to Webster Place for a movie."
"I randomly stopped in for lunch today and my wife and I each had a margarita, an appetizer and tacos. Everything was delicious and the staff was really friendly. For a local feeling bar with great food and drinks and lower prices, this place is great! Will definitely come back."
"I am really glad this placed opened in my neighborhood. I've been there a few times and always have tasty food. There's a very good beer selection and cocktails to choose from, and the food is great, including ""girlie foods"" like brussel sprouts and fried cauliflower. Very soft and dark ambience, but I've seen kids there and they have TVs for sports.The staff is super friendly too."
