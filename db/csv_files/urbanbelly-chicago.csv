Urbanbelly
"I really enjoyed the food here.  We got a number of things:  beef dumplings, lamb buns, sticky rice, kimchi potato salad, coconut grits, kale salad, catfish and chicken.  Everything was good, standouts for me were the coconut grits and the lamb buns.  Kale salad was the weakest dish.  They are serving up some nice and complex flavors. The dishes are well-composed.Dessert:  fresh house made donuts with jam.  Delicious!I plan to return the next time I am in Chicago."
"I ordered from Urbanbelly on a Wednesday night using Grubhub. The order came in about 45 minutes, which was okay, although I thought it would be a bit faster. I ordered the Phat Rice and the Pad Thai.The Pad Thai was, well, not what I was expecting. Although it did say rice cakes on Grubhub, I assumed that the rice cakes were an addition to the typical noodles in a Pad Thai. I assumed wrong! I received just the rice cakes with sauce, toppings, and grilled (maybe?) shrimp tossed inside. Nevertheless, the food was great. The rice cakes were surprisingly delicious, the shrimps were large and plump, and all the additional toppings like peanuts and garlic complemented the dish well. For $13, the portion was tiny but it was delicious, and I guess I can justify the price...a bit.The Phat Rice was larger compared to the Pad Thai. The rice was cooked just right (al dente, for those wondering), the other little things didn't get in the way of eating, and again, the portion was good (but not great!) for $13. The meats (ground chicken, pork belly, and braised beef short ribs) were definitely on point. I didn't notice the chicken too much because it was ground up and mixed with the rice, but the pork belly, which was a bit dry, was soft and tasty and the short rib was chewy but had a melt-in-your-mouth texture. All three meats had a great taste, although the Chicken was just a tad bit bland. There were ample amounts of meat compared to the rice, and by the end, I found myself debating whether or not I should order again the next day. Overall, a very delicious dish.Solid 5 stars for food, but knocking one star off for rather small portions and big prices. So far the best food I had in Chicago without stepping outside the hotel!"
"Another date night, another excuse to try something new in the city! We LOVE trying the restaurants on W. Randolph (it's the new up and coming restaurant row!), and we do love our Asian fusion. It gives me ideas on what I can try at home with whatever Korean cuisine background I have (being Korean and all).We were initially confused because we both had no idea that there were two separate restaurants. Urbanbelly is the more ""casual"" one and BellyQ is the ""sit-down menu"" one. After looking over both menus, we decided we were in a more casual mood and ordered our food at the counter. They give you a number to take to your table and bring out the food to you when it's ready. It was a GORGEOUS evening, so we sat outside in the patio area. LOVE the urban mural on the wall with the stringed lights for added decor. Really gives me that Chicago summer patio vibe and it's wonderful. The inside is beautiful too. They have a wall with lush green plants and industrial-type lighting with glass that makes it look like huge light bulbs. I am probably not describing it well, so just take a look at the photos of the interior decor to get a better idea. :)Btw, make sure to order their Kirin Ichiban on draft; it is on. point. They top it off with this beer slushie that is just icy enough to keep the beer beneath nice and cold. Are you listening? It's a BEER. SLUSHIE. on top of my already awesome refreshing beer. You guys are taking this to whole other level, yo. And I love it.We've been on a mission to try ramen places in Chicago to compare and find our top favorite. So, of course we ordered the Urbanbelly Ramen ($13) which are the ramen noodles with braised pork belly, mushrooms & an egg. Let me start with the broth: If Tom Yum and Ramen had a broth baby, it would be this dish. There was a slight sweetness to it (like Tom Yum) and there was also lemongrass, cilantro and mushrooms, all of which can be found in Tom Yum soup. Yet, it was thick like ramen broth, and slightly spicy. Talk about Asian fusion, right? The best of Japanese ramen and Thai soup! The noodles were not the absolute best that I've had, but they were still fairly good. I just couldn't wrap my head around eating a bowl of ramen that had lemongrass and cilantro in it. The egg is added whole (NOT cut in half like most places) because the yolk is runny. When you cut open that thing, get ready for some beautiful egg porn with the ooey-gooey yolk oozing out into your broth. The absolute best part of this dish was the PORK: I mean. WOW. Thick cut (and I mean THICKY THICK, like Beyonce's jelly) pork belly meat, braised to perfection. The outside was perfectly crispy, and it was so tender and juicy, melt-in-your-mouth deliciousness on the inside. I would order the ramen bowl JUST for the pork. Out of all the pork that I've had in my ramen, this one certainly stole the show. I shall crown thee as our Royal Ramen Pork Belly, behold thy Oink King!We also ordered the Phat Rice because of the reviews that we read here on Yelp (thanks, fellow Yelpers). The Phat Rice bowl is a combination fried Jasmine rice with pineapples, ground chicken, pork belly and braised beef short ribs. This was a little on the sweet side for me, I think I just like my fried rice a little more salty/savory...even the ones that have pineapple in it. But, again, this reminded me of a marriage between Chinese and Thai fried rice. They have a bottle of hot sauce (that looks homemade) at the self-serve utensil/drink cart that you can bring to your table, so we tried the rice with it. I actually wish there was more ""heat"" to the hot sauce, along the lines of what Sriracha offers as far as heat and flavors go. Overall, I want to say that I've had better combo fried rice (fusion or not) and maybe they can try not to make it so sweet? But that's just my humble opinion."
"If I could pick 3 foods that I wouldn't get tired of eating every single day then ramen, dumplings, and rice would be some pretty solid choices. That pretty much sums up Urbanbelly's entire menu. After yet another unsuccessful attempt to dine at High Five Ramen because of the insane wait, I decided to just head down Randolph and finally knock out the last of the belly restaurants I haven't tried yet. Atmosphere: Urbanbelly has its own space within the BellyQ restaurant. It's one of those places where you order and pay up front at the counter then just seat yourself. We went right before closing on a weekday so it was pretty empty inside. There were a bunch of picnic style communal tables and the decor had a pretty similar vibe to BellyQ Food: Whenever I see a really small menu, I kind of assume that the place specializes in those items and I expect them to really kill it. While they lived up to their Asian Fusion label from a creativity angle, I wasn't too blown away by the food. Maybe I was just in the mood for some more traditional tasting ramen and dumplings.Pork and cilantro dumplings - These were just ok. The wrapper was a little thin and it didn't have a nice seared edge on the outside that I like. I guess I was expecting more like a potsticker instead of a steamed dumpling. There was also something really minty or maybe it was the cilantro inside, but I thought it dominated the flavor a little bit too much and took some attention away from the pork. $7 for 4 is a bit steep for them too. I know we're not in Chinatown and don't expect them to be 5 for $1, but somewhere in between would've been nice.Wagyu beef and cheddar dumplings - I actually thought these were pretty tasty. They were deep fried, so you got a nice crunch in every bite. The inside had a classic beef and cheese nacho type flavor. They almost reminded me of Totino's rolls with taco filling, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, but definitely not worth the price.Urbanbelly Ramen - Right from the start I knew this would taste a little different than a regular bowl of tonkotsu. The first thing I noticed was the orange colored broth. While it wasn't really rich or had a really porky flavor, I gotta admit it was just straight up flavorful. I can't really pinpoint what it reminded me of, but the broth had good saltiness and the slightest hint of spice to it...I really enjoyed it. The noodles were wavey and cooked nicely al dente. It also came with two pieces of pork belly that were seriously the thickest pieces of pork belly I've seen in a bowl of ramen. Nice sear on the outside and plenty of marbling is a solid combo. The egg was soft boiled beautifully but unfortunately mine was cold in the center. Overall I definitely liked the ramen, but without the fattiness and porky flavor it was more of a really tasty soup than ramen to me.Service: I'm pretty sure it was an isolated incident, but they were a few mishaps during the meal. Even though my friend and I ordered the exact same thing, there was a huge time gap between when he got his bowl and when I got mine. Then, when I finally did get my ramen, it was missing the crucial soft boiled egg. It took a while to flag someone down, but when I did, they brought an egg out immediately. The problem was the egg is usually cold and it's heated by the high temperature of the soup. But since mine already cooled off a bit, the egg never really got warm. Such a shame too because it was boiled almost perfectly...just cold in the center for me. Overall, Urbanbelly has a good menu for a more quick and casual type meal. The food has a nice fusion twist to everything, but the dumplings just made it really expensive for what you get. $24 for a bowl of ramen and 4 dumplings seemed a little steep. I don't regret checking it out, but it probably won't be tops on my list when I'm in the mood for ramen again."
"I love everything about this place. The only thing I don't like is the fact that they don't have one in Virginia. I stumbled upon this place on Yelp and came here for dinner with a coworker during our business trip. Like everyone else said, there's free 2 hr parking right across the street making it super convenient to eat here. We walked in and immediately liked it. The atmosphere was trendy, chill, and relaxed. The decor is modern and adds to the ambiance.We ordered at the counter and decided to sit outside. I ordered the duck and pho spice dumplings, the urbanbelly ramen, and the peanut butter and jelly soft serve for dessert. My coworker got the pork and cilantro dumplings, the phat rice, and a side of kim chi. The ramen and dumplings came out super quick. The dumplings are a little pricey, 4 for $7.  But they were delicious. The duck was juicy, and the dumplings were fried perfectly. They're garnished with cucumbers and some grapefruit. The ramen was interesting. Good flavors, nice kick to it, and they give you 2 huge pieces of pork belly. Yum. I tried some of my coworkers phat rice as well, and I liked it a lot too. It was a fancy version of fried rice. The soft serve was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. The berry compote was delish, and the crunchy peanut butter worked so well with the ice cream. I'm still dreaming about that pb and j soft serve. The ramen portion was fairly large, I made my coworker finished some of it because I wanted to save room for dessert. We both walked out of there, extremely stuffed. There was a little confusion with the numbers they give you when you order. The waiter who brought out our food took our numbers away when we hadn't gotten all our food. Easy fix, the waitress who took our order walked by and we just let her know. She remembered everything we ordered and took care of the rest of it. Not a big deal to me, especially since the food and ambiance makes up for it. They also have a little station outside where you can get your own water (I actually don't mind getting my own water, that let's me get as much as I want. score.) And sauces. Belly Q, the restaurant it's connected to looked really cool as well. We almost came here again for dinner the next night. That's how good it was.Please, please, please come to Virginia! Until then, whenever I'm in Chicago, you will most definitely find me here for a dinner or lunch."
"I've been to BellyQ and belly shack already so I figured I'd complete the belly experience with a trip to urban belly.  It's a smaller quick service window in the same building as BellyQ and it's just a little more casual.  My wife and I tried the ramen and the phat rice. First off you could feed two people with the ramen.  You get a huge bowl and thankfully it's really good.  You get some pork belly and a full soft boiled egg in the broth as well.  Sometimes I'm not a huge fan of how pork belly is prepared but here I loved it.  The broth had great flavor, you could really taste all the herby and spicy goodness in there.  The phat rice was pretty good too. Not a show stopper but the short rib was really tender and the pineapples were a nice touch.  I added a little of that orange garlic sauce to it and it went together perfectly.  Not to mention I got a Kirin Ichiban draft for $3?! Where else are you going to get a draft at a restaurant for $3 in the city? By the way I've been looking for that orange sauce in bottles at the Marianos for a while now.  I saw it a few months ago and I'm kicking myself I didn't grab one.  Now they've disappeared.  The only thing I can do now is wait with bated breath for it's return to grocery store shelves.  Anyway, this place is good. Check it out!"
"Wagyu beef dumplings: 3Meh. They were alright, a little too chewy, and the flavor of the meat passable. Nothing good nor bad about them.Pork and cilantro: 3.5. A touch above the beef dumplings; we ordered these to hit $25.Phat rice: 4This was umami-good. I was gobbling up every last grain of it, the pork-belly and beef short ribs. The amount of meat was more generous that I would have expected. Service: 5I came here with a friend, based on the Alacard recommendation. The service was outstanding. They kindly let us use both Urbanbelly and BellyQ vouchers on the same bill, and we ordered from both menus.Would recommend going back. It was 60% full on a Monday night, so I imagine it is packed on weekends. The bar aesthetic is modcon."
"We finally got to try out the restaurant I wanted to try in the first place (see Belly Q review). Due to our previous experience, the owner of Urban Belly/Belly Q promptly contacted me and invited me back to check out Urban Belly and was gracious enough to send a gift card.     When we walked into Urban Belly, we made sure to ask questions on how ordering worked (we learned this time). The woman at the counter at this visit was very nice and friendly and answered all of our questions. We ordered the duck dumplings, the urban belly ramen, the pork and pineapple fried rice, and hubby got the Asian bolognese and beer. Cool thing about the beer-they use a tap that freezes some of the beer so that it stays cold throughout your meal. I don't know how it works, but it's pretty cool.     We grabbed a table and honestly it took only a few minutes for all of our food to come out. The dumplings were adequately filled and had a good flavor. The rice was absolutely delicious! The ramen was very good-I still have my favorite ramen at another establishment, but this was still quite tasty. The Asian bolognese had a lot of meat and sauce on it-very hearty. Our experience this evening was very nice-the workers were attentive and made sure we had water, extra utensils, etc. I would visit again if I was in the area."
One of the best Asian food places I have ever been.  I have been here about 10 times and always more than happy.  Was stuck on the pho until i tried the fat rice...
"Urbanbelly was an amazing experience, especially if you love ramen the way I do. I ordered the Urbanbelly Ramen (Ramen Noodles with Braised Pork Belly, Mushrooms & Egg) and Chilled Vietnamese Coffee. I made the ramen a bit spicy by adding hot sauce out of habit, but it was so flavorful it really did not need a thing. The broth was perfect just the right amount of everything, especially flavor. The pork belly in the ramen was fatty and tender. And if you are one of the reviews that said the pork belly was too fatty shut it because that is what makes pork belly, pork belly. In my opinion and my experience with ramen this definitely earns a top spot! The Chilled Vietnamese Coffee was spectacular and that is probably because the use Cafe Du Monde Coffee! In fact it was so yummy I went and got myself another! Though I might live very very far (San Diego, CA) from UrbanBelly it is one of my favorite ramen restaurants!"
"Urban belly is a great fast casual dining area attached to Belly Q. The menu in my opinion had many options for noodle or rice dishes and dumplings. There was a small selection of beer but more than enough choices. I like that the tables have small stacks of bowls and chopsticks so you can share your dishes with friends. (Asian food is always better when you can eat family style!) As for the food and service... It was so-so. The girl at the front who took our orders was nice and explained dishes when we had questions and was very patient. She also was able to substitute shrimp for pork in the ramen for one of the diners in our group who doesn't eat pork. However when our food came out, the substituted ramen arrived much later than the other entrees. We were all practically done with our food by the time the ramen came out. We ordered two of the duck pho and spice dumplings which were tasty. Nothing mind-blowing but still delicious. I had the phat rice which again was tasty but I didn't feel excited about it. I also didn't have short ribs on mine which I didn't notice until half way into my meal. Again, it wasn't horrible food but it didn't exactly leave me impressed either. If I was in the area I would probably come back but I wouldn't go out of my way to dine there. I'd prob also try something different like the Asian bolognese which sounded delicious. The phat rice was sort of a disappointment."
"This place is delicious. Finally an Asian fusion place that does it right. It's not quite like home but it tastes just as good. I ordered the phat rice and I'm a huge fan of how the fat just seeps into the rice. The pork was fatty, and the savory flavor blended well with the pineapples. Also, I'm a huge fan of sticky rice, so that really made me happy as well.I wouldn't get the edamame. It's really lacking in flavor -- I wished it was saltier. I still plan to eat through the menu though... :)"
"Very small portion and greatly overprice (because of the portion), went there last night for dinner, order the phat rice and ramen.  both is $14, the phat rice taste good, but it's a small bowl of fried rice with some pork, pineapple and egg on top of it, not worth the price at all.Next the Ramen--orange broth, taste just like Tom Yum Soup with noodle in it, 2 pieces of pork and a soft egg, Thai restaurant will charge you $9 for it, again very small portion.While the atmosphere is nice, it's not worth the price at all."
"I came here with a friend today because I was craving some noodles and was in the west loop area. It was my first time here, and the first thing I noticed was how huge the place was. Most lunchtime patrons were seated in the back near the kitchen, but there were at least 20 empty dining tables that I passed on the way to the bathroom. I thought about how cool it would be to come here for dinner or after work for a drink. What I really like about urban belly is their sizable but focused menu. I chose the pork belly ramen, and my friend chose the kimchee stew along with a bottle of kirin. We were ready to chow. Grabbing our number, we sat at these long brown wooden tables with block stools--i thought it was modern and cool. Then, 2 minutes passed and somehow our two bowls of noodles, steam rising from the server's hands, were being whisked to our table. I remembered that my friend had struck up a conversation with the guy who took our order, but altogether it took less than 10 minutes for the food to come. FREAKY FAST which is a great thing.I liked my ramen noodles and the dish hit the spot. However, the 2 pieces of pork belly were so fatty. I was dissecting it to find bits of protein amid globs of white, but my friend really enjoyed it, so much so that he wanted to replicate it at home. I thought he was crazy. The soup broth was also a tad too sweet for my taste--I think the dish would do well with some added heat. My friend's kimchi noodles came in a bowl that was considerably smaller than the ramen. I wondered why since it was the same price as the ramen and was accompanied with the same amount of meat. For better or worse the kimchi flavor wasn't powerful, but again, I was missing some spiciness. Overall it was a solid experience, but I figure that the flavor of some of the dishes could use some tinkering. After reading some reviews, I must have forgotten to ask for the belly fire sauce. doh."
"It was a solid four (4) place to have a quick lunch.  The service was speedy and friendly.  As soon as we walked, we decided what we wanted and placed the order at the counter.  Then we sat down and food was brought to the table within five (5) minutes.  I came with an impatient friend of mine; she personally dislikes to wait for food, but she didn't need go through that hassle because everything came in within eight (8) minutes. We both had the Urbanbelly ramen ($13 as of 02/09/2015).  We both liked the chewiness of the noodle and the ingredients in the bowl (radishes, a runny egg, and two (2) large pieces of pork belly).  Nevertheless, the broth needed some re-thinking; it needed more intense spices so that it could be enriched with a bolder flavor.  On the other hand, the pork & cilantro dumplings were just ok; it had an unknown sweet-undertone, which I didn't like it as much.  For $9, I probably will try another item on the appetizer menu next time.  The parking situation was convenient; there's two (2)-hour free street-parking on the island available.  You don't need to pay for at a pay station to obtain a ticket like some parts of the city.  The ambiance and service were excellent.  That's why a four (4)-rating was warranted.  If you're on public transportation, the CTA Ashland Green/Pink line station is within walking distance."
This place gets my vote all the way. WOW this is exactly the place I had been looking for.We had the phat rice and the urbanbelly ramen - highly recommend both. I can't wait to go back and try more things from the menu.The dumpling we had were perfection- I think they were pork but I do not foresee them doing any wrong any kind of meat you may choose.Dessert needs to step up a bit but the peanut butter and jelly ice cream was definitely original.Super friendly service and awesome beer selection- helped me choose exactly what I wanted (Belgian)
"WAY too over priced (like everything in that area). The food is ok, but no where near the price. $7 for 4 very small dumplings is nuts. They tasted good, but not $1.75 a bite good. The half ramen was only $8, which seems about right, no complaint there.  Certainly large enough for lunch.  It came with a nice big chunk of pork belly, which was very tasty, a hard boiled egg, some sliced radishes and of course ramen noodles. A little spicy but nothing ridiculous. The seating arrangement is kinda of unusual. When you first walk in, you will see the counter to order and one row of counter seats. I didn't realise at first that the is a dinning room in the rear with a few large communal tables. After you order the counter someone will bring you your food."
"Solid prices for solid food. I got the phat rice (fried rice with pork belly and short ribs), which I enjoyed for the most part, but I thought the flavors were a little on the heavier side--the spiciness, while not extreme, tended to overpower everything else--and the food a little too oily for my tastes (though not overly so). I really liked the setup of the restaurant--very casual but very unique decor and thought the service was fantastic, especially for a more cafe-style restaurant."
"Having now tried all of the Belly restaurants, I have to say that Urbanbelly is my favorite (and that's saying a lot because the others are great too!). My husband and I had lunch on their outdoor patio and were very happy with the experience. Vietnamese iced coffee--it was my first time trying it and though I am not really a coffee drinker, I really enjoyed itWagyu beef dumplings--amazing appetizer, you could definitely make a tapas style meal by just ordering the different dumplingsPhat rice--holy crap, I loved it. I added some spicy sauce because that's how I like my food, but it was very good and definitely something I'll be ordering againBacon and kimchi--also very good, my husband really liked it. Had enough to bring home leftovers for another lunchLiked their patio area, which is dog-friendly. Staff was nice, brought out water for our dog. You order at the counter, get a number, and they bring your food to the table. Not sure about the indoor tables but the outside ones had one of my favorite things: hooks for your purse! They kind of share the space with Belly Q, which means you walk through the entire place to get to the bathroom. The only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars is the pricing. Our lunch ended up costing $37. Not high enough to keep me from coming back, but probably won't come back as often as we'd like because of the prices."
"I came by on a whim for lunch and it was exactly what I expected after seeing their menu - an Asian fusion place that doesn't do Asian quite right but hey, at least they tried (seems like the general theme around West Loop) Appetizers: Duck and pho spices dumplings - best item that we got. It's not absolutely to-die-for amazing and it's certainly not something I would come back just to order but it tasted pretty good. They are fried more like pot-stickers instead of dumplings. I got the Urbanbelly Ramen which was mediocre at best. The menu says it comes with mushrooms but there were none in my bowl. The pork belly was average and the broth was decent but lacked the fattiness needed for ramen soup. Of one thing to note is that this is one of the few ramen places out here that adds a soft-boiled egg in their soup. Toppings wise - the bowel was definitely lacking in decorations. My friend got the rice cakes which again, we both thought was fair for Korean-American fusion. Medium spice but he definitely worked up a sweat. I wouldn't recommend eating this for one person as it's a pretty one-dimensional dish and let's face it, that's a lot of carbs. Awesome decorations inside and a decent-sized patio outside for your dining pleasure. Order before you sit!"
"What's not to love about Urban Belly. I've been a fan since they were in Avondale but this was the first time that I've been able to make it to the new location...cool digs! Love that Belly q is right next door so I can visit next time.I got the urban belly ramen and side of eggplant and it was so delicious! I think I must be on a ramen kick bc I just had some at Santouka in Mitsuwa this past week. Urban belly was so much delicious! Briny broth with two big pieces of pork belly...which were so delectable! A perfectly cooked egg with a runny yolk that dribbled into the broth...and I tossed a bunch of the eggplant into my soup as well. I have no idea how they cook the eggplant but I think it's sautéed and then soaked in some kind of vinegar ...totally addicting and if anyone knows the recipe..please let me know! they used to have a spicy eggplant ramen which I loved...it's no longer on the menu, thus my improvisation. Happy to have had my lunch there today!"
"Food was really good. Ordered phat rice, urbanbelly ramen, eggplant side, duck dumplings. The eggplant side especially was really YUMMY. Staff was very kind and accommodating. The ambiance was nice too."
I love asian tapas style. This place has very good food and they do not pretend. The flavors have some korean insights but definitely they make adjustments to the food that are really special!
"I was coming here before they moved from California ave. loved their food before, right now they are still very good, however, it has become somewhat generic. Before they had very delicious specials and many types of noodles, but they took a lot of items away from the original menu. Still like this place but not the same as before."
"We ordered three popular menu items, phat rice, urbanbelly ramen and Wagyu beef dumpling.Phat Rice is a mix of many things. This is similar to Korean Bibimbap. It's similar because there are many things and you mix them together. The similarity ended there. The problem with this dish is I was hoping to have more Asian spice in them, and it is too sweet for my taste.Next, we had urbanbelly ramen. I like this dish because of the kimchi flavor in the broth and it's a little spicy, but I don't like that it's again too sweet. The egg and the pork belly are good.Finally, we had Wagyu beef dumpling. This is the most disappointing dish. I don't taste anything but the sauce that they put on top. The sauce is way too overpowering. Overall I feel like they tried to be fusion, but failed miserably. I'd categorize then as Americanized Korean food instead. I rated them 2 stars because of that."
Great spot for lunch or fast dinner Food: unique very good food presented beautifully. Decent portions. Do not lack in flavor whatsoever. Pad Thai is different so buyer beware. Ramen is super good with rich deep favors. Decor: super trendy and very Randolph street hip. People: everyone is super nice and willing to help. Do not get annoyed by questions like some super trendy places often do. All in all a must go and a great spot for lunch.
"Came here for a quick lunch with a friend, thought it was delicious and will definitely be coming back. It's a nice casual place for a quick bite to eat. The staff is helpful and nice. I ordered the Kimchi Stew and my friend ordered the Mushroom Pho. We both thoroughly enjoyed both meals. It was a hard decision to choose what to order, as well, because everything sounded so delicious. I definitely will be back to try some other things out. It's great and affordable and I will definitely take advantage of the take-out at some point!"
"FOOD: 4 stars - The lemongrass chicken and the special, udon bolgenese were both very good with wonderful flavors.  The portion sizes were somewhat on the small side so may need more than just one entree per person if you don't want to be hungry again in a couple hours. The udon bolgenese was a bit messy and challenging to eat with the noodles being slippery and the meat sauce not sticking to them. Wish I would have listened to pervious Yelpers and got the Phat rice instead of listening to the lady that took our order. SERVICE: 4 stars - Food ordered at a counter and then it's full service after that. The service was attentive but could have been a bit more friendly all around.  ENVIRONMENT: 4 stars - The decor and ambience were very nice with a great outdoor patio. We had to move tables because the 1st one we sat at was very off balance. Free parking directly behind the building before 4pm I believe is very nice."
"I had been to the old Urban Belly once or twice in my pre-yelp days. I loved the small location on California, but this location has definitely taken it up a notch. I don't know what it is, but it even seems like the food has gone up a real notch too. Either way, UrbanBelly is an absolute MUST for anyone traipsing around Randolph. What led to me coming here was a friend was in town. A small group of us were looking for a place to BYO and I did know that Urbanbelly has $0 corkage on Sundays (c'mon guys, make it more days than just that) and we wanted to take advantage of that.  Instead of actually packing ourselves, we basically ordered everything at the same time. In short time, we had a ton of food in front of us in the form of the eggplant, rice cake, lemongrass chicken, and wagyu beef dumplings. The eggplant was first on the docket. These were done perfectly. It sometimes can be a real bitch cooking eggplant and that was far from the case here. Add on top of it the complex spicing to it, and we had a real winner. Right after that the wagyu dumplings were what we dove into. The first thought and words that came out of my mouth when eating the first dumpling was: whoa. The sauce had some spice to it and it contrasted beautifully with the quasi savoriness of the dumpling and meat. This was one of those dishes that stopped me and put me in my happy place. It was then time for the more substantial dishes. The lemongrass chicken was really complex and was awesomely not really what we expected. I normally would've expected this more like a thai dish, but naw, that wasn't gonna happen here. The chicken was mixed in with the rice and eggs. This was you were able to get a bite of everything every time. As good as the lemongrass chicken was, the rice cake was the absolute star. The broth was absolutely awesome as it had a sweetness and heat to it at the same time. Add in the chicken and small rice cakes, and you have a bowl of absolute awesome. The service was absolutely fantastic. We were out on the patio and it started to rain. They were all really helpful getting our bottles and food in before. They were really friendly the whole time and help make the overall experience a very positive one. I walked away impressed and dead sure that I will re-visit as much as I can. With sunday's being $0 corkage, it looks like sunday will be my night too. I really look forward to trying out everything else."
Went here last night with a group of about 12 people. They were very accommodating with our group size and there is plenty of seating! It's great for a group because you order at a counter instead of at the table which makes paying painless. I ordered the rice cake noodle dish and it was so delicious! There was so much food though- the leftovers will keep me satisfied for at least 2 more meals. Also delicious were the pork and cilantro dumplings with soy balsamic sauce. Will definitely go again
"We walked into Urban Belly/Belly Q after we discovered the place across the street was closed for a private party. Urban Belly had been on our list of places to try for a while so this was a good opportunity to check it out.We actually sat at the bar on the Belly Q side but ordered from the Urban Belly menu and had a couple great Belly Q cocktails. The Stove Pipe is a bourbon based drink and was perfect. The Red Lotus is a sake and yuzu drink that was even better. Drinks ($11) were 5 star quality.We weren't totally famished so we split an order of Duck and Pho Spices dumplings ($7 for 4) and the Pad Thai ($14). I thought the dumplings could have come with a more interesting dipping sauce, but they were good. The Pad Thai was an interesting and tasty presentation with rice noodles and some interesting slices of rice cake. Only 4 shrimp in the dish, maybe 2 more would be nice. They had a house hoisin sauce that was good, but the other one they had wasn't great. Overall, the food was 4 star.Service was really good, food and drinks came up quickly. Lots of free parking on this end of Randolph Street."
"Different type of ramen served here. The chef has cleverly combined a chow mein styled noodle, pork broth, and rich gochujang paste. It was a good chance of pace, and I would consider this to be a mid-tiered shop. Pros are the convenient free parking and the do-it-yourself seating."
"We discovered this gem thanks to the Michelin guide. We went here so often that the wife of the owner will recognize us and greet us warmly. This is the best Asian fusion noodle soups place worldwide: creative, surprising, extremely flavorful, ...and extremely affordable for the quality of the ingredients and the creativity you get. It was awesome they had specials to keep things fresh. Some new combination of flavors to experience....I learned to appreciate spicier foods based on their incredible offerings.We also enjoyed their lamb dumplings and the complementary ginger candies that come with the bill.The restrooms are clean.The place is conveniently located on the way to Chicago O'Hare airport. The parking was free.A must try if you are in the area."
I just ate the best ramen of my life! And it was takeout! I definitely need to dine in!The soft-boiled egg was cooked (and kept) perfectly considering the time it took for delivery. Pork belly was oh-so tender and dat broth tho! Ahmazing.We also had lemongrass chicken and wagyu beef dumplings which were delicious.
"Phat rice and Rice & Salas bowl are great. House ramen is a little too salty! Overall, cool place and tasty food :)"
"I have done take out from here a few times.  Brilliant location putting it next to west loop athletic club.  The phat rice is loaded and full of flavor.  Diced pinapple / beef / pork/egg/spice combo mix really well, The pad thai is really unique in a good way.  Its covered in sauce so you don't have to worry about it being dry.  Both of these dishes are definately worth trying. It is not your traditional pad thai!As for the dumplings, they aren't that great or worth it. Pass on them"
"Came here for the highly rated ramen. It's definitely not a traditional Japanese ramen, but Urbanbelly's unique approach is quite appetizing. The flavors mixed well with the spiciness, the toppings were pretty great. The pork belly was delicious, however I do wish they put more of in the ramen. The duck and pho spices dumplings that were highly raved on yelp were a disappointed though. I was expecting something more unique, but it tastes just like any other normal dumpling."
"Came here to try out their ramen and it satisfied my cravings. The soup base was just right, not too spicy but had a nice kick to it. I also tried the wheat veggie bibimbap and that was not bad either..had a good amount of avocado which I liked and kimchi flavor was not too overpowering."
"Urban belly is incredible, the staff is super friendly, the dumplings are delicious ( go duck or wagyu beef fo sho) they have some really inventive noodle dishes that look as wonderful as they taste.The seating on the patio is awesome in the summer, but fear not, the inside is gorgeous with some really cool hanging light fixtures, communal tables and some wall vegetation.Bottom line...eat food here and you will be happy and full like I am."
"You can choose to sit inside or out in the casual atmosphere of Urban Belly or come back for a romantic dinner on the Belly Q side. Same kitchen, same chef, two amazing menus."
"Bill Kim's empire continues in the west end of Restaurant Row on Randolph.  Went here for a work lunch and it reminded me of the same Urbanbelly as it was up north a few years back.  Considering this is tied directly next door to Belly Q, the entire space is amazing.  For lunch Urbanbelly, does not disappoint.  We began with Pork Dumplings and I had their Lemongrass Chicken Fried Rice.  The dish had a lot of great flavors with a heavy tones of curry and the sweetness from the pineapple.  The space is so casual with communal tables that force you to sit with the awkward foodies, logan square hippies, and west loop yuppies.  Either way, it's a great place and looking forward to trying Belly Q in the future."
Came here for lunch with a few friends awhile back. I got the rice cakes with chicken katsu. The portion sizes are very big and prices are reasonable. The service is good especially since the food comes out relatively quickly. I enjoyed it but it wasn't amazing and I thought that the dish could've had more to it. I will say that they cooked the katsu very well. My friends both got the ramen and said that it was good.
Had the pad Thai and thought the Korean rice patties were really delicious and interesting! Shrimp was high quality and fresh. The flavors were really spectacular too. Looks like everything on the menu is a winner.
"A couple of weeks ago my wife and I were invited to check out UrbanBelly, and were glad we did.  The menu here has three main focal points in their offerings, dumplings, grains and noodles.  Of course they also have a kids menu, desserts, beverages etc. but these categories are really what drive the concept.  We decided as good guests should, to try some of each.  We started by trying both the wagyu beef dumplings, consisting of crispy beef wontons with cheddar, romaine, tomato & topped with a horseradish sauce and also the pork & cilantro dumplings which are steamed pork dumplings served with a soy-balsamic sauce.  Normally I am not a huge fan of balsamic anything but in this case it balances the sweetness of the pork so well its difficult to dislike, when you add in the crisp bite the cilantro brings, I was quickly won over.  Next we moved onto grains, selecting two different options, both the lemongrass chicken (jasmine fried rice with scrambled egg & ground chicken) & the phat rice (combination fried rice, ground chicken, pork belly & braised beef short ribs).  There was a beauty in the simplicity of the lemongrass chicken, it was both comforting and well balanced and could easily feed two people.  There is an old saying, any Chef worth his salt can create a great dish with a lot of ingredients, but when you focus on a select few, the execution can be more difficult.  We also tried the phat rice, which is one of UrbanBelly's signature dishes.  At first glance it seems like there is almost too much going on.  However, once you dig in you are...Read More at:  2views1life.com/2015/07/…"
I ordered the urbanbelly ramen and duck dumping I got to say it's quite disappointing... For the ramen.. The pork belly is over cook and chewy.. The egg is under cook .. Broth is way too spicy to maintain its favor...  The dumpling lacked favor to cost $1.75 each... Quite a disappointment
"Just got delivery on this stormy night and Urban Belly hit the spot. I ordered the amazing Urban Belly Ramen, which I was concerned would not be spicy enough. The spice level was right on point. I also ordered the edamame. It was in the most fabulous spice oil  mixture that I would love to know. Now I want to visit your restaurant to get the full experience."
Urbanbelly has become my go-to spot for take-out food since moving to Chicago.  It's been a cold winter and I find comfort in the food Urbanbelly creates.  The Ramen is my absolute favorite dish!  It has warmed my San Diego Soul on many a cold night this winter.  Ordering is fast and efficient and the staff is great.  I am thankful to have Urbanbelly so close to my home.
Delicious mushroom pho! It's hard to find good veggie pho and this place did not disappoint. Good price for the quality and size as well. It's a great place for a causal meal. You order at the counter and can sit wherever you want. Would love to come back next time I'm in Chicago.
"I met a girlfriend for lunch during the work week thinking it would be a good spot for a mellow meal. It was exactly what I anticipated. It was quiet for lunch, most guests were outside in the small picnic style seating area. The staff were polite and casual, helpful with recommendations for newbies. I had the phat rice and dumplings, my girlfriend had the  special of the day, I believe it was with lamb patties. The dumplings were pretty straight forward, nothing really to write home about but still good, but the rice was delish! Too good in fact, as I proceeded to eat the whole bowl, needing a nap afterwards. I will be returning, for lunch, dinner and take out!"
"This is a great little joint. Prices are reasonable and interesting variety of ways to serve pork belly in an Asian Fusion kinda way.The Phat Rice was delicious, and I loved the Wheat Berry Bibibop. (I put mine in the phat rice, and it was perfect.)The tiny donuts were perfect... because we walked away pretty full."
"Summary: Cool concept, awesome decor, but the food is ""meh""I was in the area and wanted a cheap(er) bite to eat that wasn't McDonalds, also I was wearing sweatpants so I didn't want to step in anywhere fancy. Found this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  It's a ""split"" restaurant - with part of it being the swankier, more expensive Belly Q, and Urbanbelly being the more casual, less-costly joint. So I didn't feel totally out of place in my sweats. Things took a dive though when it was time for the food...What was good: Phat Rice. They didn't skimp on the meat - which I love. Threw some hot sauce on it and I enjoyed it.What to Skip:The Urbanbelly Ramen was disappointing - my friend and I both agreed it was too sweet. Also the egg that was included tasted like a hardboiled egg they had just thrown in - and the yolk was missing. The Pork belly was just ok. Don't come here for the Ramen.The Pork & Cilantro dumplings were pretty plain. Nothing to write home about.My friend and I had also wanted a cocktail from their bar - but the bar was in the more expensive Belly Q portion of the restaurant. So you can't order a drink from there in Urbanbelly.While I loved what they've with the space, the food at this place wasn't memorable. I'd look elsewhere for some good Korean/Ramen."
"I had a late lunch here yesterday with a friend.So here's the dilemma - the food is astounding. And the portions are large. And they serve you within seconds (literally) of you sitting down. So why is this anything less than 5 stars?The service is awkward. Drinks are handled by the counter, which is at the front of the house. My date and I had our meal before we had water. And there was a half-full container of water at the table that no one bothered to refill or clear from an earlier group. I get that water shouldn't be wasted but leaving that half-full container of water with us and not offering a new one, or any glasses even, just made me feel like they needed some help.The food was awesome, though. And the waitress was cool. They just need to figure out the counter situation for when they get busy in spurts. Guests should never have to wonder about how to get a drink."
"Came here for lunch with 2 friends on a Saturday afternoon, and we sat outside on probably one of the last days of Summer. The patio is really adorable with some really trendy painting on the brick walls.I ordered the pork cilantro dumplings and the pork belly ramen. Both were SO delicious. In comparison to the variety of ramen out there, this ramen is a bit sweeter and not very spicy. However, the belly fire sauce was clutch -- so definitely try that if you like your spice."
"I loved this place!First, I think you have to know going into it that this is an Asian FUSION place, so don't get your panties in a twist that they aren't following grandma's recipe to a T. Some things are different than you might be used to, but just go with it.We had the pork dumplings to start--they were pretty big and perfectly cooked. It came with five of them, which was a hefty starter for two of us. I had the phat rice, and my friend had the lemongrass chicken. This was a situation where we both had to ask a server to take our bowls away, lest we eat ourselves into oblivion. We were both stuffed but couldn't stop eating.We sat out on the patio, which was a really nice place to relax. We hung out for probably an hour after eating and no one bothered us (it was a slow night). It was pretty annoying that motorcycles were revving their engines past us every five minutes, but I'm not gonna fault the restaurant for it.For two entrees, an app and two drinks, our bill was just under $40. Maybe a little pricey for a casual night out, but overall a good experience. And we'll definitely be back."
"I used to go to Urbanbelly when it was up on California near Belmont.  Their new(ish) location (combined with belly Q) in the West Loop is amazing.  The atmosphere is perfect, the seating is ample, and the food is just better overall... makes sense since their kitchen is combined with belly Q.  I LIVE FOR THE URBANBELLY RAMEN. They are usually very generous with the pork belly they put in the ramen.  The broth is so rich, with the perfect amount of sweetness and spice. It lives in my dreams. I'm going to be real with you - I haven't tried many other dishes but I'm giving UB five stars for their smart move on the location, lovely ambiance, and amazing UB ramen.  If I'm dreaming about your food for days after I leave, you get five stars from me."
"This is two restaurants in one building. One is BellyQ and the other is Urban Belly. Urban belly is the kind of place you look at a large menu hanging from the ceiling and order before you sit down. Seating is not particularly comfortable, there are only benches and stools to sit on.Food was great! I got the Udon Primavera and and arrived really really fast. Do not get the beer. Not a huge selection and the Chang beer tastes nonalcoholic."
"Went here for my birthday in November, and I must say that I was thoroughly impressed! I had a massive party of 16 people, but the restaurant had accommodated us very nicely.The ambience is fantastic, as you're surrounded by wooden furniture in an artfully run-down factory-like building. The lightings were very carefully placed and I loved it!I had the experience of eating their Wagyu Beef dumplings and Urbanbelly Ramen, and they were both wonderful. The dumplings were extremely juicy and had the asian flavors I was looking for, and the ramen was some of the best you can get in Chicago. Doesn't quite beat the ramen at Wasabi in my opinion, but fantastic nonetheless. I also enjoy the fact that their dishes all seem to be a sort of fusion between different asian cuisines.Furthermore, I tried the Phat Rice and the Rice Cake that some of the others in my party was trying, and I'd have to say, I'm definitely going back there for some more of that.They also have a BYOB option on certain weekdays, so I'm excited to try it out. I cannot wait to go back!"
"unappetizing mashup of all asian foods into a soup, over seasoned greasy confusion. very very not yummy."
"I was prepared for the worse but in a pinch, it's pretty decent. I SAID in a pinch. I wouldn't go out of my way for it nor would I crave this rendition of ramen. I tried their urban belly ramen and the crispy noodle one that's vegetarian friendly. The two tasted basically the same with one not containing any meat. The crispy noodle one was a lot sweeter and with crispy noodles instead of regular noodles. They both tasted pretty sweet and five spice like which anyone of asian descent can make. Also they need to lay off on the sugar cuz one more wrong move and this would have been inedible. It's all the same shit just douse it with a ton more sugar. It didn't have typical tasty things like bamboo shoots in it. So at least it's edible and didn't make me too upset. I just needed soup and I don't do soup from a can nor soup from some deli with the exception of whole foods or plum market.. and I wanted some asian flavors. You're not missing out if you haven't tried the ramen here. I tried their duck pho dumplings and they were okay. It didn't blow my mind nor was it notable but I can see how it'd blow the minds of non Asians that have more basic palates and didn't grow up with these flavors. For them being 9 bucks for 5 small ones that tasted just average felt like a rip off. Again you're not missing out if you have never had these. I also don't like dumplings fried whole. I just feel like when you have to ruin it by frying it whole you're just hiding your shitty dough making skills. Fried potsticker style is ok. Their kimchi is very weak. There's no punch; I wish it were spicier and more pungent like a good, typical kimchi but it's like American grocery store type. That was the most disappointing, I wish I didn't waste money on that. Blech. Skip it!Their Vietnamese coffee will keep you up until the next day like any decent Vietnamese coffee should.For the quick tip on the app that said he feels sad for those who have never eaten anything this good referring to the duck dumplings.. I feel sad that he thinks this is that good. People must have eaten really shitty ass foul food growing up.The most laughable part is they sell a few ginger chews and I mean A FEW for over 2 dollars for not even a whole bag when you can get the exact same chews at any asian store for a dollar- and you get a whole bag of it. Bitch please... Thinking you're getting something real special huh non-Asians. I pity you. Just like when you buy a 4 dollar bottle of sirarcha sauce that goes for 1.50 for us asians."
"I ordered some Ramen carryout during a frigid Chicago Monday and was happy with the five minute pick up parking spot in front of the restaurant.  The staff was friendly, and the restaurant looked great inside....too bad that I was not dining in.Now, the Ramen.....a huge bowl of amazingness.  Wish that was a word.  The broth was fabulous.  It was perfect on a below zero day..super flavorful and obviously a recipe that has been given a lot of attention to....Yumm."
Great food. You get a good amount left plenty full. Nice neighborhood feel to the place. Got the phat rice which was good. Friend liked the pho.
First time here.  Great food.  I had the pineapple and pork fried rice.  It was great.   They also have their own hot sauce which is great.  We are in the patio which was a great experience.   I can recommend this place.
"So my wife and I were one of ""those"" people. We ordered the ramen without pork, and the phat rice without pork. When my ramen came out, it was without pork but I forgot to ask is the broth wasn't pork or not. Turns out it was and I apologized profusely and the staff was like ""hey no problem, it's our fault. Can I get you the same dish with chicken broth?"" They were so accommodating and I was really embarrassed but when it came out, it was amazing. The ramen had such an earthy flavor. Really deep and hearty. Just amazing. The phat rice was stellar as well, the beef was crazy tender and the subbed out the pork for shrimp. 5 pieces no less! They really made our night and I cannot recommend this place enough. Drop what you're doing and go. Now"
Try this place out. We sat in the outdoor patio which was pretty great. Everyone was happy with the food. Service was a little slow.
"I really, really wanted to like this place. A friend brought us here for dinner club saying it was one of her favorite restaurants in the city and the menu was unique and exciting, so I had high expectations.There was a group of us and we went up to the counter to order and then sit at our reserved table to wait for the goodies. My pork and cilantro dumplings came out first and they were good, though not as delicious as I hoped- they lacked seasoning, I thought. My friend's duck dumplings were similarly under-seasoned. But I was hungry and finished my plate. And another dish was coming. I had ordered the pad thai for my entree and was well aware that it was a different kind of pad thai with rice cakes instead of noodles. What I didn't expect was the mint leaves, which overpowered the dish. For whatever reason, whenever there are mint leaves in a dish, that's all I taste- that bitterness overwhelms my mouth and it doesn't sit well in my stomach. I ate the shrimp and some of the rice cakes, but didn't finish the dish. The server asked if something was wrong and I said it was the mint, an ingredient that I wasn't expecting in pad thai and I would not have ordered that dish if I had known it was in there.Fortunately, I had donuts coming to hopefully save the day. Alas, they had orange peel on them, another ingredient that overpowers and I actually cannot eat  because I'm slightly allergic and it makes me nauseated. The description for these donuts was ""maple-glazed"" with ""Vietnamese cinnamon-"" no mention of orange essence. I couldn't eat them.To the restaurant's credit, the server did ask if we had any food allergies before we ordered, but would I expect orange peel to be anywhere in a dish? I appreciate a modern and simplified menu, but ingredients should be listed in the dish description, especially such overpowering flavors as mint and orange using ingredients that potentially don't sit well with customers. Yes, I'm an exception when it comes to certain ingredients, but I guess so is the 2 star review.As for the ambiance and service. Service was fine, but it was super loud in the restaurant. I know it's counter service and kind of upscale fast food, but my meal cost me nearly $40 with tip and I expect to at least be able to have a conversation with my friends while I was (not) eating my food."
"Came here for lunch Friday afternoon and place was not very busy but still a decent amount of customers. Did enjoy the atmosphere and venue, as the outdoor seating is a nice touch. I ordered the ramen, wagyu beef dumplings and duck dumplings. Cousin had the pork and pineapple rice. We were brought out our drinks promptly. I had the iced tea (black tea with lychee) which was nice and refreshing. My cousin did not enjoy his Vietnamese coffee as it had a cinnamon flavor to it. Next came our appetizers. Both dumplings (5 pieces each) weren't bad, but not very memorable to me, as the meats didn't come through to me much.My ramen again wasn't bad, and was not expecting anything authentic, but was not as flavorful as it could be. Was nice to see a few big pieces of pork belly though. My cousin enjoyed his rice dish and the pork belly pieces were plentiful.The service was great as the gentleman who took our order consistently checked up on us and was very friendly.Wouldn't mind coming back, but not in a hurry to do so. Will likely check out BellyQ next door first."
The Phat Rice is out of this world.   I really don't see the need to eat anything else at Urbanbelly.
I love the atmosphere  here and the service here is good!Delicious drinks and foodPay first up front and seat yourselves.Good place to chill esp in the summertime when you can sit outside on the patioAlso its byob sundays
"***********I dedicate review # 500 to a very deserving business, Urbanbelly!*************I like when I'm wrong about things. I mean, it happens to all of us, so why not just embrace it and admit it to the world when it happens? I tried Urbanbelly at their old location and I was left uninspired and disappointed. My friend and I were going to a show at the City Winery down the street and were wandering down Randolph looking for something to catch our eye. When we finally found BellyQ, we decided to stop in since I've had it bookmarked for awhile. We ended up walking into the wrong door and finding that we were ACTUALLY at Urbanbelly. I kinda groaned, since I've tried it before, but the girl working the counter was so enthusiastic. She made me want to give it another go. To start, she was absolutely amazing. I know that an entire Talk forum was dedicated to how overused the word is, but there's no one more deserving of the word 'amazing' than her. We were definitely out of our element by looking at the menu--unsure of what certain things meant--but she was reassuring, cool and confident and didn't bat an eye. I decided on the special of the day because she painted it in such a positive light: the waygu burger with fries for $10. My friend ordered 3 of the waygu beef dumplings. The burger was perfection on a bun. This was my first time trying kimchi, but I was an instant fan. Normally, I'm only a fan of traditional cheese/ketchup/mustard/onion/lettuce burgers, but this one made me change my mind. The steamed bun was a little soggy, but it was still one of my favorite parts. It was so light and airy against the waygu beef. All of the flavors on the burger mixed well together, which was one of my original complaints about UB my first visit. I'm normally not a fry person, but these fries were insane. They had a Japanese chili seasoning to make them have a little kick but nothing unbearable--even for me. (This spice is sold at the front counter for $4. Of course I bought a bottle to bring home.) The beef dumplings were fantastic as well and reminded me a lot of ""rangoons""  more than the soft, pillowy dumplings that I'm used to. They were very crunchy and delectable. I could have eaten all of them with only a little guilt.It was pretty empty in here when we came, but they still have the communal tables like they did at the other location. I'm not necessarily a huge fan of them, but I guess I'll learn to deal with it since I'm going to be coming back here oh-so-soon."
"I visited Chicago a week and a half ago and I'm getting cravings for the ramen and dumplings. This was one of my favorite meals during our trip and it was so simple and casual. All the tables are communal. We went around 2pm and we had a whole table to ourselves. Not sure what it's like during lunch and dinner hours. FOOD: We ordered the urbanbelly ramen, shrimp udon, duck and pho dumplings & phat rice. I'd recommend sharing a noodle dish, i was only able to finish half my ramen, especially if you want to experience other items on the menu (which I suggest you do.) The dumplings were so crispy. The phat rice was great, i wish I could just order the short rib that's in it.SERVICE: The staff was nice and the food came out quick. The gal taking our order gave us the recommendation for the dumplings and they did not disappoint. HIGHLIGHTS: Ramen and Dumplings! Tips: I saw a sign that they offer free parking if you arrive before 4pm (I think)And you can call ahead for a communal table takeover for parties of 8 or more!"
"I'm always on the hunt for a comforting bowl of ramen and decided to get Urbanbelly a try. Much like Paul L's review, I can't say that I left feeling the fusion. We started off with some wagyu beef dumplings-- Cheese it, it's a pierogi. Fry it, it's an empanada. Top it with some ""kewpie""-like asian mayo-sauce, it's somewhere inbetween this trifecta of dumpling identities. Decent, but not worth a repeat.I got their ""Urbanbelly Ramen""-- no matter if it's authentic or reimagined, a good bowl of ramen: good balance of broth, well-cooked noodles, and toppings. The broth was too salty, lacked depth. The noodles were okay, and the meat was well-prepared. The boy ordered their ""Kimchi Stew""-- a spiced broth filled with ""dukbokki""-esque pieces. Good choice for branching out from the traditional offerings.  Came to Urbanbelly with an open mind and hungry bellies. But Urbanbelly just didn't rub me the right way. I guess I'm just too old fashioned with it comes to ramen."
"Urbanbelly's decadent rice and noodle dishes are, quite simply, da bomb. Last night we decided to fight off the early onset winter with some hot soup and rice, and I have a feeling we'll be back many times over in the coming cold months. The egg noodles came in a spicy, complex pork broth with tangy pieces of eggplant and smokey mushrooms accentuating each bite -- a must-order!!! The phat rice is an old standby (3 kinds of meat - yes please). And although we weren't drinking this time, we were excited to learn that Urbanbelly is BYO on Sundays!For a yummy fix of pan-Asian awesomeness, definitely try Urbanbelly!"
"Cool atmosphere, but underwhelming food.  Dumplings were a good start, something different and really tasty.  The actual meals (Phat Rice & Pad Thai) tasted good, but nothing special.  Probably won't go back."
Good place to have noodles. The ramem with pork belly was very rich. The broth was intense and the belly had a powerful taste. Pork dumplings were ok. The decor is beautiful and clean.
"I enjoy trying new dishes at UB, but I must admit the Shrimp Pad Thai is still my fave! Great combination of Korean rice cakes and shrimp, peanuts, toasted garlic and chives."
"Fast, delicious, affordable.  My only complaints are 1) the combo of spicy and salty burned the back of my throat in a unique and almost intolerable way (ALMOST .... but I managed to eat through it) and 2) the tall table seats were too high for the table.I will return!"
I've been here a couple of times for lunch and definitely always good food. The location isn't the greatest just because it's just outside of walking distance from my office but if I have the time it's worth it. The pho was really good and the ramen is awesome. If it was closer I'd order from here all the time. They have outside seating but obviously it's next to a busy street so it's a bit loud.
"Three stars for the food itself, but I'm upping to four for the overall experience.  I was really excited to try this place, having heard good things about the ramen here.  Walked in at lunchtime on Saturday, and while there were many diners inside, there was no wait to order.  After you order, you can pick out a place to sit and someone will bring out a pitcher of water, which I thought was a nice extra.  As for the food - I tried the signature Urbanbelly ramen and a side of the duck pho dumplings, along with a bottled drink from their cooler.  Total came to a little over $25.  Both dishes came beautifully presented, and arrived to my table quickly (less than 10 minutes after placing my order).  The quality of ingredients looked outstanding - everything seemed very fresh.  The dumplings had a nice, almost tea-like herbal flavor to them.  I'd certainly order them again.Now, the ramen - you get a good-sized chunk of very tender pork belly with not too much fat around it.  While the pork belly was solid, the rest of the dish failed to live up to the hype.  The broth to noodle ratio was a bit too high, and the spice used, while good at first, tasted a tad sweet - which I found a bit overbearing as I got halfway through the dish.  This was my fourth ramen experience in Chicago (having tried ramen at Kamaya, Strings, and Ramen San).  Personally, I would rank the ramen here above Strings, but below Ramen San and Kamaya).  While I was not blown away by the dish that brought me in, I would certainly like to come back here and try other items on the menu.  The atmosphere is quite pleasant, service is excellent, and the quality of ingredients is strong."
"So this place is cute and has alright food but I'm very displeased with the fact they charged us $18 to cut a cake we brought to the restaurant!!!!!! They charge per slice, I mean who does that?! Very disappointed."
"Great food and friendly service. We enjoyed the food, ambiance and staff. We will definitely be back again soon!"
"Saw this restaurant on Anthony Bourdain show and stopped by excited for some good food. What I got instead was Chung King type, watery, tasteless fried dumplings with no hint of duck, and a bowl of soggy fried chicken and chewy oval disks that soaked in a virtually tasteless bath of broth. The service was poor, but good beer prices made my experience complete to make sure I don't eat here, but maybe come to drink on the patio."
"Been wanting to try here for a while and I'm glad I did. Overall it was a yummy, fun meal. Service was great, quick and friendly. Food. Me and my BF got the pork potstickers. Eh. Ok but they weren't freshly cooked. They weren't even hot. Mushroom pho: I really liked this. Good flavor and the mushrooms were plentiful. Phat rice: very good. Would likely get this again, but I definitely added spicy sauce to it. Overall a nice experience. Wasn't blown away, but I would try again."
"The Phat Rice was pretty solid. Jasmine rice with seasoned ground chicken, pork belly, wagyu short ribs mixed in with pineapple. It was a solid mix of Thai, Chinese, and Korean flavors that managed to complement each other well.A bit on the pricey side for what you get, but quality trumps quantity here. The counter is a great place to sit down and eat if you're here for a quick lunch bite. Grab a cold beer from the cooler, and enjoy your meal. Or have your food brought over to the BellyQ side if you're dining in."
Stopped in for take out and got 4 dishes. The service was great and atmosphere was too. 5 stars for that. My review is for 2 stars because the four dishes we bought were nearly inedible. The best way to describe the food from my perspective is watered down Korean fusion...with the oddest choices on flavor pairing and temperature choices. Take the Korean pad Thai ... Korean duk noodle.slices cold & brittle dry on edges...with a watery broth that wasn't spicy with some light veggies and protein added. Again...nearly inedible.  Total bill for 4 was approx $60 for lunch.  We are right in the neighborhood so are sad it wasn't better. Meet for drinks... Skip food
"I want to first say that I hope to go back and try their ramen - hopefully then I can up my rating.The food was just ok.I got the Phat rice and it was just ok. I thought I was suppose to get short ribs on top, but I got cut up pieces of meat and without the bone, I could not tell if they were short ribs. This was not bad enough to complain about but also not good enough to get again. I feel like I could have made fried rice just as good. I also sampled their edamame and the donuts. The edamame was ok, decent flavor but a little oily at the bottom. The donuts are too sweet and they don't have the crisp that would have been nice to have in a donut this size, instead it was on the soggy side which is not my preference.My friend though got the ramen and he was very happy - I will have to try this next time.The service is GREAT!My friends and I were there for a long time chatting and we didn't feel rushed to leave - granted it was a slow Monday night with enough seating for everyone who came in. The servers were very nice, never imposing, attentive when necessary (they refilled our waters long after we were done eating - much appreciated!)"
"Wow. What a meal I had here! This place was incredible. I ordered the rice cake noodle soup, the pork and cilantro dumplings and the lemongrass chicken fried rice. My favorite part was the balsamic soy that is set at each beautiful communal table. I could literally bathe in that stuff. I love that they have it for sale at the front counter! The rice and soup both were exploding with flavors that I've never experienced before. I was seriously blown away. The soup was spicy, but perfectly balanced w a bit of sweet from the mango. And those rice cakes? Yea, what the hell are those- they're amazing. More of a noodle texture than anything else. The dumplings were good- but not anything I haven't experienced before. Had i not stuffed myself into oblivion on rice and soup, I probably would've given the little guys more attention. Being a restaurant designer myself, I was blown away by the stripped down, raw design of the space. The oversized Edison bulb lights in the middle of the room are gorgeous- but the show stopper is the real living green wall. I want one of those bad boys in my house. I cannot wait to come back here! I need to try everything on this menu"
"Was feeling under the weather and crunched for time trying to catch a flight so I searched to see where we can pick up some good take out.  For places like this, I would rather dine-in and take into account the service, decor, blah blah blah but I didn't have a choice so this review is based on take-out only.We ordered the mushroom pho $12 and the phat rice $14. The pho was lukewarm upon pick up and the flavor was just bland and the noodles were way over cooked very mushy, unpleasant texture.. The basil was just over powering and I had to add a lot of siracha to even make it worth eating. The phat rice was definitely the better of the two. The only reason for 2 stars. Was it good? Yes is it worth $14? Probably not.I was really looking forward to trying this place. The menu is the type of food that I like, however it was just overall disappointing. Maybe I'll try the food dining in at another time."
"Big fan of the new digs for Urbanbelly. They have a few inspired Ramen creations on special, and they were surprisingly tasty.  One week they had a salami ramen, and the next week it was a lamb ramen.  Their regular ramen is quite tasty with big and tender pieces of pork belly.  The shrimp udon was great with excellent noodles.  The beef dumplings are a good starter (could've been a little crispier, though), and I'm excited to try the buffalo chicken dumplings eventually.It looked like the rice dishes were a little small, so I think I'll stick to the hearty bowls of soup.  Communal tables are hit or miss. The tables themselves are beautiful, but sometimes you get stuck next to awkward first dates or people wondering loudly why their FB friend list is dropping. I can think of a few reasons.  That's not really the fault of Urbanbelly, just my crumudgeoness.  I like that there are bowls and ladles on the table if you're going to share soup.I kinda miss the Avondale spot, but I'm good with this one.  Especially the random wall of green, it's nice to look at.  Also, the benches are pretty heavy. I showed off my weak-arm ability by struggling mightily while I tried to move it a few inches.  Don't be that guy!"
"Excellent. Prettier than the old California location. we came at a slow time and the service was excellent.  Nice outside seating.  The ramen was nicely spiced. We had the pork dumplings, which I felt were a tad too greasy. The veggies under them were great.  loved the Phat Rice. Since we ordered too much, I took a bit back--it made a great breakfast."
"This is not really a review, but rather a thank you to the good folks of Urbanbelly.  Bringing the family into Chicago for my wife's birthday celebration, I had a faint hope of making a stop here and trying out Bill Kim's food for the first time.  But with two little girls, doing dinner at a modern, community-seating urban restaurant is a rather intimidating ordeal.So I made the call to ask them if it was a bad idea, and they told us to bring the little ones.  Upon arriving at about 6PM, the place was nearly full, but the lovely Korean girl taking our order took it upon herself to find seating for all 4 of us, including a high chair.  Thank you!!  That took a great deal of the stress off, as waiting around with two little ones late in the evening doesn't work out, nor does splitting the family up.I was a little concerned for the group we were seated right next to, but they were extremely friendly and made the kids feel very welcome.  Great proprietors, great clients.  Better yet, the food came immediately, and let me tell you--after the first bite of the ramen, the pho, and the pea & mint dumplings, all our concern, weariness, and hunger faded away.  Even our little girls seemed as happy as they've ever been after a long day in a busy restaurant close to their bedtime.The food was everything I had hoped for.  Recently I spent time in Korea and Japan, eating some of the best noodles in the world, including the options at the newly minted Tokyo Ramen Street.  Finally, I've found a place here in the midwest that I can say holds its own, and is a perfect meld of my selective palette.  The ramen noodles I would say are 90% of what you can get at the top joints in Japan, but let me tell you--those two slices of meat are mind-blowing.  Kim could teach the greatest Japanese ramen chefs a thing or two about that.  Keep in mind you can also add extra noodles for $3.  Additionally, having a wife who's completely vegetarian, I am so grateful for the vegetarian options--and more than just the usual one option.  It means we're going to come back here every chance we get to come to Chicago.The only place in North America I would dare compare this place to, is David Chang's Momofuku, which is also great. After my experience tonight, however, I give the edge to Bill Kim. Again, to the proprietors and employees of Urbanbelly, thank you so much for giving us the best meal tonight that we've had since moving several years ago to the midwest, and for being so accommodating to our palettes and our children.  Beyond solving the social problems of Chicago, I really can't think of a greater service you could provide.  I hope delivering such a meal is as rewarding for you as it is for us to consume it. We wish you the best. - The P.K. family of SW Michigan."
AMAZING ramen. It hit the spot in so many ways. It's true that it's on the sweeter side but the spice and savory tastes balance it out in the best way. I LOVE spicy food and this was good for me. I might add some more heat myself but it was honestly perfection and a great treat for a chilly night. Sat on the wrong side of the restaurant I guess on a Saturday night but the bartender was nice enough to get me the menu and bring me my ramen. Urbanbelly = happy belly.
This place was so yummy I am dying to go back!! My husband and I ordered the miso ramen and fat rice - both were excellent although the ramen made a better meal.  Such delicious flavors!! We came by for lunch on Friday and it was totally dead. Worked out great for us!
"Found this place from an interview with famed pastry chef, Mindy Segal, on the website, Eats Abroad. She said urbanbelly was a place to try when you're in Chicago. She went further and recommended a dish, the phat rice, which was very helpful. I have to say that dish made me a believer. It was the perfect comfort food that mixed rice, succulent meats and pineapple. The interior is beautiful as well with communal seating in addition to individual tables for reservations. As a guy from out of town, I wouldn't consider going this far out of the city but I'm glad I came across this recommendation because I'll go out of my way again for it. And you should, too!"
"Went there on a very cold night, the doors were a little tricky to keep closed. The food portion was very generous and very tasty. I also loved the green walls, they are very photogenic! But I would have love to have had some more spicy veggie appetizers. But overall it was awesome."
"Good food, I had the urban belly noodles. It was kind of expensive but there was a large portionService was horrible.Tttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt"
"Checked this place out a couple of weeks ago! Really good setting. It's odd when you arrive because there are two sides and one side is the ""classy"" restaurant and the other side is the cheaper side but still has class to it. You will order at a desk.....the food is good...I got so full and it was decently tasty!! The sangria was good too! I'll def try this place out again. I love the neighborhood this place is in too!"
"Where to start. Well after eating here, all I have to say is WOW!  I loved it!  I came here for lunch, with my cousin, right when the doors opened. What a great time to go. We didn't have to wait to try the awesomeness and it felt like we had the place to ourselves.  My cousin and I agreed to share a ramen, appetizer and another dish. We decided to go with the duck and spices dumplings for our appetizer, the urbanbelly ramen and the highly recommended phat rice. For drinks I ordered the ice tea (so good and refreshing) and my cousin ordered the iced coffee (also very good). We got our number and proceeded to the sitting area. As typical Asians, our cameras came out and we started taking pictures of the restaurant, which was beautiful by the way.The food finally came after a short wait and we couldn't wait to start digging in but before we could we had to take pictures!  Now on the the food. The duck and spices dumplings were fantastic. I personally love duck so I was going to love this regardless. On to the the ramen. Wow!  The urban belly ramen was crazy good. It had just the right amount of spice and salt with a hint of sweetness. I couldn't get enough. The pork belly was tender and flavorful and complimented the ramen so well. On a side note, the egg was perfectly cooked.  Impressive!  Last but not least we tried the phat rice!  OMG!  So dope!  It had three types of meat (pork belly, braised short ribs and chicken). It was perfect and the pineapple was the key to tying everything together. It was safe to say that we loved the meal. Everything was fantastic. I can't wait to go here again to try more of the dishes. If you haven't tried this place, you're missing out. You have a loyal fan in me, Urban Belly!  My stomach thanks you!"
"Top line: Inauthentic. This place seems more concerned with aesthetics than knock down food and flavors. I wouldn't eat here again. Someone else hit it on the head with their review ""Upscale hipster meets PF Chang.""Here's what we had:Duck & Pho dumplings - Way too fried. Couldn't really taste the flavors of the meat and spice.Kim Chee- Fine, but definitely nothing unique, interesting or exceptional.Eggplant- Probably my favorite dish. Ramen- Totally uninspired to be their signature dish. While the pork belly was pretty tasty (nice and braised), the noodles lacked that savory coating from the pork. The broth was also slightly sweet (kind of weird). Basically, the ramen was rated G and I was hoping for NC17 (or at least rated R).Service- Had a bad experience. My two companions received their ramen within a minute of each other while I waited and waited for the kimchee, eggplant, and my bowl of ramen. After about 10 minutes, I heard the server who took our order go back to the kitchen and tell the cook ""there's still another ramen."" Not sure what the cook was doing, but wasn't behind the line. This place wouldn't last in a more ramen centric city like New York or D.C."
Only giving two stars because of how rude the staff was to me. The food was good though
"I was craving ramen, so I got on this thing and searched for my cravings. I chose Urban Belly because it was closer to my apartment, and because the reviews weren't too bad. I read through all the negative reviews first, and I'd like to address those:A few people said the ramen bowl named after the restaurant itself was too sweet. I actually thought it was a perfect mixture between sweet and spicy. To be honest though, that's my favorite combo of flavors. I love sweet, spicy and savory. Second, a few people claimed the noodles were too hard. I don't know what those people were talking about, but the noodles were al dente. Perfect! Another negative review claimed the pork belly had too much fat on it. Again, I don't know what that person was talking about but, pork belly is a good mixture of marbled fat and meat. All-in-all, I liked my ramen craving choice and will be dining in next time, as the decor looked splendid!"
"Urban Belly hits the spot at lunch time. I went here with my cousin today and I left fully satisfied. We had the Phat Rice, Urban Belly Ramen, and Pork and Cilantro dumplings. The Phat Rice was a delicious medley of all things you would want in fried rice, pork belly, wagyu beef, and pineapple to add a sweet contrast.  I also had the Urban Belly Ramen. The pork belly was tender and not too salty. It was soo delicious. I wish I had room in my belly for the whole bowl.  I highly recommend those two dishes. The Pork and Cilantro dumplings were good but I felt it was missing something.We saw Chef Bill Kim cooking in the kitchen and take some plates over to the table next to us. It's always nice when you see the head chef deliver food straight to someone's table. We took a walk around the restaurant  before we left and he came to us to answer any questions that we had. Super friendly and nice guy.I love the décor of Urban Belly/Belly Q. I love the framed wall of plants. It's nice seeing some greenery in the this horrible Chicago winter weather. The light fixtures and other wall art are so chic.  I would totally come back here for lunch."
The food here hits the spot when I'm craving some Asian cuisine.  You can't go wrong with the dumplings.  I recently had the Buffalo Chicken which was so good with the Bleu Cheese dipping sauce.  The Beef and Squash dumplings are also both very good.I LOVE the Phat Rice entree.  The flavors are spot on and the meats are marinated and cooked to perfection.  I also love both the Mushroom and Shrimp Noodle Soup dishes.  I'm glad they've moved to the West Loop -- this new location has a beautiful interior.
"Asian fusion within four blocks of home. I will be getting takeout much more now. I have enjoyed a few dishes and they definitely fit the bill to stop in for a quick meal. I hold a place in my heart for Asian inspired food, especially ramen.Quick counter service. Community seating is fine with me. I like to meet new people but it can get awkward if you are not that type of person. If you are that type just get your food to go and you have nothing to worry about. The decor is well thought out and easy on the eyes. I also enjoyed the city lounge compilation music playing in the background.To the food; pork belly ramen and phat rice on separate occasions. I woofed them both down with much pleasure. The portion size seemed a bit meager for the price point but I didn't leave hungry. I will return to try the dumplings and other dishes. It's pretty cool to see the owner in the kitchen too. This goes for my visit to BellyQ as well. My only gripe is they bring out the food when it's up rather than together if you ordered with someone or a group. I was half finished with my food when my roommate's dish came out.Working from home more often I will be running across the street to grab lunch. A great addition to Randolph street and now I can fulfill my Asian Fusion cravings without hesitation."
"The ramen was okay, but I can't really compare it to traditional ramen, because it just isn't.  When tasting the broth alone, it almost tasted like pho to me. It's on the sweeter side and it has cilantro and lemongrass in it. And the pork belly was a little dry. I'd come back to try out some other things on the menu."
"If you're in the West Loop area, UrbanBelly is one of the restaurants you have to go to. I know there are a shit ton of great restaurants at West Loop to flick that bean of a palate you have. But this is the best Asian restaurant you'll find with an affordable price. Trust me when I say that I do know great Asian food. If you haven't guessed by the title or the restaurant it's belly-centric. Pork-Belly to be exact. I recommend getting the Phat Rice because it's filling and it has layers of different meat that mesh well with the Chinese-Korean fusion dish. To simply put it; it's Chinese Fried Rice meets Korean BBQ.The ambiance is similar to a ramen bar or something even familiar in West Loop... The Publican. Its decor is planky. Literally it has wood planks. It has a great dim lighting feeling like most restaurants tend to have. What it does nicely is integrates an American contemporary lounge atmosphere with an Asian family style feel."
"Delicious. Delicious. Delicious. Did I mention it was delcious?When we arrived, we were surprised to learn that it was not a sit down restaurant.  Rather, you order at the counter and they bring your food to you very quickly.  It does NOT have any sort of fast food type feel, by any means, just quick and friendly customer service.  We ordered the Mushroom Pho, UrbanBelly Ramen, and the newest Pad Thai stir fry, with a side of kimchi.  Everything was mouth-watering good, BUT.. the Pad Thai was definitely the best.  Instead of using traditional pad thai noodles, they use Korean rice cakes.  What a delicious, unexpected, and very welcomed twist!  I typically steer away from less complicated foods, as I like to be a little adventurous.  This deviation from the traditional pad thai dish was very nice;  I wanted to ordered another serving to take home.  The ramen and pho were both flavorful and came in hefty portions.  Both my friend and I said we would be back very soon! The price was very resonable for how much food we ordered.  The ambiance and decor was very pleasant.I would recommend this place to all!  Next time, I think I will try their sister restaurant right next store, BellyQ.  Thank you for the delicious meal!"
"My friend and I became victims of a nasty hit-and-run two hours after our meal here, and we, after accepting that the car was totaled and while massaging our necks from the whiplash, still found ourselves raving about the hauntingly spiced, pho-inspired broth of the Urbanbelly Ramen. Never mind those firm, delicious noodles, the impeccable soft-cooked egg and the succulent-with-the-right-amount-of-chew pork belly; these were mere accoutrements to the savory sorcery of the broth. The only suggestion for improvement that I can lend to this bowl of goodness is for the kitchen to throw in some torn leaves of Thai basil, which would add a bright, sweetly herbal element. We also devoured the Phat Rice, a kind of fried rice on crack, with a scattering of pineapple and generous, hearty toppings of crispy pork belly nuggets, Wagyu kalbi, and a ground chicken mixture reminiscent of Laotian larb. And then there was the kimchi, that spicy, pungent, umami-riddled delicacy that I ate almost every day as a child. Urbanbelly's perfectly fermented rendition, although toned down in spice and given a healthy dose of sesame oil, reminded me of my late Korean grandmother's and got me a little choked up ... and almost made me forget that we paid three dollars for a tiny bowl of it. I'm no cheapo and I know Mr. Kim needs to make his money, but come on. It's like charging two bucks for that pickle wedge you get with a sandwich. And especially after the guy at the counter raved about them, the pea, mint and goat's-milk feta dumplings underwhelmed. The scant amount of underseasoned filling in the thick and chewy mandoo wrapper, with way-too-crunchy edamame strewn on top, made for a disproportionate, disjointed dish that is also the most incongruous item on the menu. I would want to see it reworked or discontinued. That and the price of the kimchi aside, we really enjoyed our late lunch and look forward to returning and trying something new. Being from Honolulu, where Asian fusion abounds to the point that you almost can't escape it, I was very pleased with Chef Kim's mostly successful efforts and SO GLAD to get something not easily found outside the city. Ugh, the city is just better ..."
"When Asian fusion cuisine is done right, it can be really exciting and crave worthy. I love the idea of taking the sweet, spicy, and herbal flavors of Asia and reinventing them with Western ingredients. But when it's not done right, then I sort of feel like I've been duped; when the flavors don't match up to the menu's description, then it's kind of like Internet dating gone wrong.That was my thought when I tried Urban Belly, which I thought was kind of a dud. The menu looks great, full of interesting ethnic combinations and gastronomic juxtapositions, but nothing here really turned me on.The Lamb & Brandy Dumplings were just OK. A bit too sweet from the glaze and whatever condiment was on top. The Kimchi Stew -- noodles, pork belly, kimchi broth -- was just a mess. None of the component parts really came together in a harmonious way. Moreover, I was not fond of the flavor of the noodles, which tasted processed to me, and the broth was too far a departure from the kimchi jjigae that I know and love. The best dish was undoubtedly the Phat Rice -- fried rice with chicken, pork belly, and galbi short ribs. The short ribs were good, but that's about it.If you are a foodie from out of town, then Urban Belly is probably on your radar. But don't bother. Certainly, this is much closer than its previous location out in Avondale, but in my opinion, it's still not worth the trip.Honestly, the best thing about Urban Belly is that it's BYOB with no corkage."
"I heard about this joint and was extremely curious to try it out.  My friend and I ordered 4 from the 'dumplings' section: 'Chicken & Mushroom' (mushrooms were mild and not overpowering; chicken was okay); 'Lamb & Brandy' (pretty solid flavor, a tad juicy, and one of my favorites); 'Asian Squash & Bacon'' (reminded me of butternut squash pasta ravioli, but I couldn't taste the bacon); and 'Duck & Pho Spices' (my favorite - the duck was juicy and the pho spices worked well with the meat; loved it dipped into the side of soy sauce that comes with).  From the 'rice' category, we ordered the 'Short Rib & Scallion' (3 little individual galbi pieces set on top of fried rice; the short ribs were more on the sweet side and it was fatty; and the 'Pork Belly & Pineapple' (little cubes of pork that had a good fat to meat ratio on top of fried rice).  From the 'noodles' section, we ordered the 'Rice Cake: Chicken, Mango, and Korean Chili Sauce' - this had the dduk slices and cubes of mango, and the broth was a little too watered down for me.  There were also fishcake balls in the soup which I thought didn't really add to the flavor.  As a side, we ordered the 'Seasonal Kimchi,' which were more like ggakdduki (radish cubes), but was not fully fermented; it also came with a sprinkle of cilantro which I was not a fan of.  I do suggest the 'Lamb & Brandy' and the 'Duck & Pho Spices' dumplings.  Diners also receive a bowl of ginger candy, wrapped around with rice paper - be cautious since it can get a little spicy!  I'm glad I was able to try this place out.+'Lamb & Brandy'+'Duck & Pho Spices'+under-ripened kimchi"
Sexy interior! Open early! Super healthy and delicious PanAsian cuisine. Love a great West Side restaurant.
Great place and vibe! The food here is excellent! The phat rice is a must try and a glass of tinto to wash it all down. A must have in the Chicago area!
Awesome menu and great service!
"Okay, first off who puts CILANTRO in ramen?! Ugh. Nope. I spent the first 10 minutes of my meal fishing out all the cilantro. Also, what's with the broth? It's kind of sweet, and just all kinds of wrong. I understand this is a ""fusion"" place, but still, there's no reason to claim that what I ate is considered ""ramen"". The only things that saved this meal was the pork, the egg, and the iced tea. The pork was really good and I always love soft boiled eggs. Their iced tea was also nice and refreshing. The portions of the food seemed good, but that didn't help the taste much. It was a little pricy for ramen, but the size helped and it was nice that the egg was included. The layout of the whole restaurant is very..interesting. It's connected to Belly Q, which I guess is the fancier version of Urbanbelly? There's a fake wall that separates the two restaurants. At Urbanbelly you have to order at a counter first and then you can sit behind the counter to eat. Since you order your food first, there's not so much involved in the service aspect, but the workers at the counter were friendly and nice. Overall, I don't think I'll be back."
"Ordered food here a few times on GrubHub several times and often it was late, and the food was cold, but this time it was over two and a half hours.  No communication from the restaurant, I will never order from this place again."
I'm a little surprised to read all the positive reviews for this place. My first visit today was mostly disappointing. I sent the ramen back twice because the temp wasn't hot and my duck dumplings were tiny shriveled balls that exploded boiling oil when I bit into them. I noticed someone posted a picture of their duck dumplings and they had a five dumpling portion while my plate came with only four. The noodles were ok but the broth was mostly without body and soul. guess I hit them on an off day but not worth the risk to try again.
"Very good non traditional Korean fusion. Love the Urbanbelly ramen and well as their fried rice. A very unique menu at some surprisingly cheap prices, wrapped into a tiny little restaurant. The portions are decent (in the case of the ramen, their huge). The food is unique, high quality, well thought out and well cook. The atmosphere is obviously ""urban"" and prepy. Overall, if you like korean food, asian food with a twist or hell just trying something different, they are definitely worth giving a try."
"So, I'm not the biggest fan of peanut butter and jelly anything...I know, how can I not like peanut butter and jelly you ask? I just have never had a desire for it. Well, I tried their peanut butter and jelly ice cream desert and now I'm HOOKED. They use this special crumbled up biscuit cookie mixed into the peanut butter, ouhhweeeee. Oh and their food is delish too. =)"
Great place.  Interesting mix of Asian fusion. It's counter service so you can get some great quality food without having a server if you're not in the mood for that type of meal.
"A friend recommended Urban Belly and I owe him a beer. Or three. The fact that he purchased my dinner in no way influenced this review!I've eaten so much mediocre Chinese food in my lifetime. Needless to say, this is miles above General Tso and his chicken army. Funky and unexpected flavor combinations abound. Kinda like an Asian Chipotle Grill. I ordered the pork and pineapple fried rice which was very good, but my standout favorite was the Rice Cake Noodles -- out of this world! We also ordered two different dumplings which were not quite as memorable as the noodles and fried rice.Did I mention they have a small but eclectic beer selection? The outdoor seating was definitely a bonus -- the tables and ourdoor string lights set just the right vibe for a relaxing meal. I can't think of a better place to meet your friends or have an impromptu after-work meal."
"The tofu bowl was yumm! We liked the setup, nice casual ambiance with good quality reasonably priced food. Would love to go back."
"True to it's name - Urbanbelly is an urban Asian gem of the city. Not always a fan of fusion (particularly because of my own Korean bias) it's not easy to get the taste right but a recent large shared plate experience for my birthday dinner made me change my mind!  First, I would highly recommend for large groups and parties! For several courses and various options at $25 per person, the entire group all left happy and full!  Kristin, the Director of Operations was incredibly helpful and helped make the dinner a success!  She emailed a various plate options, personalized our menu, and stopped by just enough times to make sure everything was going smoothly!  Granted this is a restaurant review but EVERYTHING was great! From the seasoned edamame, side dish kimchi to the crispy waygu dumpling, lemongrass chicken fried rice (my favorite!), and the donut dessert- it was all mouthwatering and delectable! The drinks were fabulous, I mean dangerously good, and the ambience is just right! Not overly done but sets a mood.  The ONLY recommendation I would give is to update the karaoke machine!!!!!  It was a piece of junk that really put a dent to the whole concept!  I guess to me it was like serving great food on a broken plate.  Interesting at first but not really a smart idea!  So perhaps that gets changed ASAP and then I will have another party there soon!!!"
"OMG, this is the best. We had eaten at their old location and I have been dreaming about their noodles and dumplings ever since. My husband wanted beer and a good burger on Randolph St but he forfeited because I wanted UrbanBelly and he now admits it was awesomely good. It's also a family friendly place with lots of space, a great outdoor patio and a kids Udon noodle bowl that could feed my son for three days.Highly recommend the rice cake soup and the ramen. A-maze-ing."
"The Phat rice is amazing!  I have not had anything like it.  I've had better ramen, but overall, this place is awesome.  Great food and kid friendly!  The drinks were so yummy!"
Sadly still blehhhh. Came back here to give it another shot since last time I went it was newly opened and I thought by now they would hopefully have things figured out.  Sadly the ramen is still scary salty. I could barely eat it and ended up wasting most of it. Such a shame. I want to like this place since it's so close to home. Oh well.
"Being Vegetarian wasn't sure what options I would have, but they have plenty !! Mushroom Pho is DELICIOUS and awesomeness spicy-kick. Lemongrass Chicken rice (with no chicken), spiced edamame and other small sides were more than enough for my vegetarian palate. Will return again and again."
"Dude soooooooo good. Came here with a group of 4, buddy had the bento box, he said it was suuuuuper meh, but that's what you get for ordering that SUPER lame item, not sure how it survives on menus! As for me, this ain't my first rodeo, I knew better, and my buddy KNEW I knew better, which is precisely why he said to order for both of us, because I know my biz. We got the wagyu and duck dumplings (5 pcs each) I say the clear winner was the duck, but some of the other guys voted wagyu, but it was just beef drowned in sauce to me. We also got the phat rice, not sure if it was the multitude of orders but it wasn't piping hot when it came out and it kind of should have been, but damn was it on point. And to finish it out we had to get the Urban Belly Ramen, and let me tell you it did NOT disappoint, broth was of the heeeeeeeeazy, poached egg exploding all over the soup, pork belly chunks, it was a really incredible. However, one revelation, Pork Belly Ramen = sleeping pills at work....say goodnight. The food is good enough to be a sit down but it's not, you order at a counter and they bring it out to you. Will def go back."
The options for lunch in the West Loop on Randolph are many and there are more to come. But we always find ourselves back at Urban Belly. Every visit has exceeded our expectations. Today we had udon noodles with crispy chicken along with the pork and cilantro dumplings with soy balsamic. Both are must-haves and absolutely delicious. Another thing to love: a kid's menu.
Very high quality food and great service.  I have been here a few times and never fell in love with anything...I had the Pad Thai recently and it was good but a little on the busy side for me...a little too much going on with ALOT of different flavors.  It's a different take on the dish but I knew that going it.  I will be back and will try the Rice Cake with Tonkatsu my colleagues all loved it and it's their go-to.
LOVE the lemongrass chicken! I've had it twice now and it's delicious. Also love the PB&J ice cream.
"Not for old Logan loversWe've been here at least 6+ times since the move, we use to go at least 1-2 times a week in Logan and order out on top of that. What a sad and disappointing transition.UB has lost its ambiance, it's menu, it's BYOB appeal, and it's specials. Just this week we had our first somewhat good experience, which is no surprise since the staff updated us that they made improvements to a couple dishes. Portion sizes are better and the pork pineapple rice was closer to what it once was.And don't get me started on BYOB just Sundays schpeal, give us a break!At the old location they Always had a noodle special and either a rice special or salad special. Not anymore. I call UB still asking if they have a noodle special and nothing. Now they have a soft serve dessert special?? What is this FroYo now instead of masala chicken noodle special???And gone is the shrimp polenta salad and gone is the bacon from one of the best dumplings. :(This use to be our special spot we took ALL out of towners including our friends from Hong Kong on a food tour we created. Sadly, we have removed UB from our personal food tour and don't stop in regularly any longer.They get 3 stars Only because Monica & Daniel who work there are probably the two kindest and genuine people in Chicago. Otherwise UB gets 2 stars."
"When I think of Urban Belly, I think of (overpriced) Asian cuisine with a twist. The menu items are creative but the food didn't really deliver. I went with a friend for lunch and ordered the phat rice, wagyu dumplings, and cinnamon donuts. The rice could have used more flavor. I was underwhelmed and I'm definitely used to receiving a larger portion when dining at an Asian restaurant. The dumplings sounded tasty but I really couldn't tell that wagyu beef was used. The donuts were fresh and made to order but I definitely wouldn't make another trip here just to have them."
"I had a very mixed experience. The mushroom pho may have been the worst thing I ate in 2014. The broth was earthy and oddly sweet, making for a very unpleasant taste combination. The noodles were gummy and stuck together. I couldn't make it past two bites. The eggplant side was exceptional. It is an absolute must. The kimchi was solid. If you are a vegetarian or pescatarian, I'd suggest you go elsewhere."
"Went there on a double date.  There was plenty of street parking, Free, two hour limit. We tried the pork dumplings, delicious. Then we had the lemongrass chicken ,which the serving size was plentiful, and was very good. I ordered the Tinto, which is a combination of red wine and blood orange soda, and enjoyed every drop. Last, but not least, the dessert-maple glazed mini donuts were awesome. There were enough to share with a small group. The atmosphere is casual and the staff are friendly. I would definitely go back again."
"I went to UrbanBelly this past Saturday with my boyfriend and a few of our friends. My sister suggested I try the ramen, which she said is the best she's had. While, I don't agree it's the best I've had, I cannot deny the fact that it was delicious. The pork inside was perfectly cooked, and the broth was SOOO GOOD. The patio was very nice and well kept and the service was good and everyone was very pleasant. No one seemed  too annoyed at the littlest one running around exploring.  We also received our food very fast, which is always good for the super hungry, like myself.I think that it is safe to say that I will definitely return to try the rest of the menu. I enjoyed it very much!"
We came here on a whim with a group of 4 and 2 babies. The staff was friendly. We ordered a whole bunch of different entrees and shared.  The food was not spectacular nor disgusting.  I probably won't be coming back.
"I'm so glad this place is close by me. Ramen is like Asian soul food. If you have a homemade bowl of it, it's so money. I had the pork sausage special ramen, and it was phenomenal. It was flavorful, and had a great combination of items in there. The buffalo chicken dumplings were so inventive. It was nice and spicy and crisp and a great fusion of flavors. I like the take on the Edamame and the spicyness of that as well. I was so happy that they have hot Vietnamese coffee. Oh it was such an indulgent yummy meal. The staff was helpful and so quick in bringing our meal and clearing off th table. I'd love to come back."
"Never got a chance to go to Urbanbelly when it was on California, but have been several times since it relocated to Randolph.  Love the quick service with restaurant feel. Food is great.  My 2-year-old loves the noodle soups, lemongrass chicken with rice, and pork belly.  I wish street parking was easier, so we didn't always have to pay for valet.  Seating is first come first serve, but I've never had a problem.  You can reserve tables if you have a party of 8 or more!"
"I visited their old location before and had the veggie ramen, and I was not a fan at all. I remember the noodles tasted over cooked and the broth was really thick, as if it was sitting out for too long.I was not aware they moved, since I had a bad first experience, till my sister went to the new location. We both came here for dinner a few weeks ago and not only have they improved on their menu, but the place is also a lot bigger plus a really nice outdoor seating area. It's order at the front and sit/serve, and service was pretty fast.They have a generous amount of veggie options, which is always appreciated. We had the Pea & Mint dumplings, Pea Shoots, and Mushroom Pho. All pretty yummy and tasty. My favorite was the Pea & Mint dumplings, with the edamame on top a nice addition. The mushroom pho was my least favorite, only because it was a little on the sweet side, which isn't something I'm use to with pho and also I don't like to mix sweet with savory.I'd definitely go back though."
"The ramen was too ""interpretative"" to call it ramen. Don't get it if you're looking for ""ramen."" The pad Thai had dumpling-like noodles which were delicious! Next time I come back, it will be for that and the appetizers."
"I was disappointed with Urban Belly. Most of the dishes had an unpleasant, overwhelming flavor. The atmosphere was fine, but the expensive prices and mediocre food make this place nothing special."
I enjoyed the causal vibe in this new location & the vegetarian selection! The potstickers were great & my rice was good.
Overrated? Yes. I like my ramen soup salty and spicy and this one was kind of on the sweet side. The pork belly was excellent but other than that nothing special. It's a little over priced for a bowl of noodles soup. Oh and the viet ice coffee was disgusting i had to toss it out! Never put cinnamon in my viet coffee!
"As a fan of UrbanBelly, I find myself very surprised I am writing this review. 4 stars for sure if the review were based solely on the food. I placed an order through grubhub and when the food finally arrived, it was lukewarm or cold and the driver forgot to bring the beverage. I got an order of ramen and duck dumplings and a sprite. I also found what seemed to be a bristle of a pastry brush. Every time I have gone and EATEN IN urbanbelly, its been a great experience. Genuinely surprised, and disappointed."
"The rice cake ramen was one of the best items I have ever eaten. The flavor was great, and it was satisfyingly filling, but what really put it over the top was the texture of the foods mixed into the bowl! I really have never had a food become so impressive based on the texture, but trust me, put some of the sliced, gooey medallions of rice patties in your mouth with the crispy fried pork strips and you'll be taken to a whole new level of jizz in your pants that you didn't know existed."
This review only references delivery: do not get delivery from urban belly.Food quality: ramen is tasty high quality pork and a fantastic cut with beautiful marbled pork belly. Unfortunately it was room temperature when arrived.Wagyu dumplings are well balanced and horseradish gives it a fresh flavor. Once again they had gone soft due to condensation in the box.I did not recieve my full order and it took around 75 minutes to arrive Despite the $7 delivery fee. This is a place I would try in person based off their ingredients and sauces. I am a big ramen fan and in Chicago they make a decent ramen. But this is far from the best ramen I've had and more expensive than it should be.
"Definitely a fan of the raman served here. It was served really hot, which is a critical factor missing in many of Chicago's upscale (i.e., expensive noodles) raman noodle places. I ordered the special the night I was there, which was a mushroom and cumin based bowl with pork broth. The noodles were very Q (ask a Taiwanese friend). My wife is a vegetarian, so she ordered the mushroom pho, which was also served hot and was good. The next time, I'll have to order the more ubiquitous pork belly / poached egg bowl. The service was fast and the seating is communal. Urbanbelly is a good pre-United Center event place to eat - or anytime one feels like walking away from the main drag of Randolph."
"I've been in here a few times w/friends and by myselfI'm a fan of Asian beer, they have a small varietyThe favors are good and I LOVE LOVE LOVE that togarashi(I've been to belly shack too, just ok, a lil pricey for that locationI'd like to try Belly Q, located in same building as Urban Belly)My only thing is I'm not into this new communal Dining trendI go before it gets busy. There is a little patio on the side near Ogden, for when it'sNice outside."
"Kudos to the masterminds behind this restaurant! Seriously, for real, BRILLIANT!!!None of this good is traditional, so lets not get crazy with ""this is the best (insert dish here) I've ever had"" because lets face it pho here is ""pho"" not pho etc BUT everything here nods to the traditional while putting a crazy unique twist making each dish something never tasted anywhere y truly one of a kind!Buffalo chicken dumplings sound a little odd to you? They absolutely did to me, but embrace the weird! In sure glad I did because the combination of the chicken meatball + crispy dumpling wrapper + buffalo sauce + pickled celery rocked my world!The lemongrass chicken y ramen were also very good. My tip -- add their hot sauce to the rice plates even if you don't like it by itself. Mixed in with everything it elevates it to a whole other level!"
Just horrible - we were excited to try the ramen here but was utterly disappointed.  The broth was so sweet.  I would highly recommend Wasabi (authentic ramen) where both broth and noodles are amazing!  We came with friends and they did not enjoy their dishes either.
"This is a short review but it's a counter service place.  I ordered the Urban Belly Ramen and they use chinese egg noodles rather than actual Japanese ramen noodles. I know there is only a very slight difference in texture, but it is noticeable.  However, they were able to do the soft-boiled egg that typically accompanies Ramen absolutely perfectly (meaning that the egg white is firm but the yolk is very runny. Their pot stickers are very tasty, and their vietnamese mini-donuts are delicious.  I will definitely be back.  Their pork belly is a little fatty though, and not super tender.  But it's good enough."
"I found this overall dining experience somewhat odd. If you're looking to have a relaxing dinner with a drink and some friends this isn't the place. If I lived in the area and could pop in for take out, I would probably do so, but making a special trip was not worth it. I'm vegetarian so I ordered the mushroom pho and mint/pea dumplings to share. The dumplings were just ok, but I appreciated the vegetarian option. The pho broth was really flavorful and delicious. I would definitely order that again. The meat eaters at my table also really enjoyed their meal. The three star rating comes from the overall dining experience. If you want a drink other than a slim selection of beer and wine, you can walk over to the bar at belly q. The house cocktails are $11, which is fine but not ideal. I was mostly annoyed that a titos and soda was costing me $10. That is definitely above average price for restaurants on Randolph. After ordering drinks from a bartender who seemed put out to serve us, we went back into urban belly where you order your meal at a counter. The staff on either side just had a weird attitude like they weren't happy to be there. Not bad enough to ruin the meal, but just not a great aspect of my experience. I just think urban belly should loosen up and become a casual BYOB asian restaurant."
Urban belly ramen and lemongrass rice are so good! Tried a few others' food and was pretty tasty. I prefer this to its next door higher end neighbor.
Urbanbelly Raman is to die for! Duck & Pho Spices dumplings... Yum! Pb&j dessert ahhhh it's so delicious. The peanut butter has a crunch!!!
"My boyfriend and I were catching a concert at the Bottom Lounge and wanted to grab food before hand. We had found a fantastic parking space and didn't want to give it up to get food so we looked for something within a few blocks and ended up settling on this place. We were leery of dining here because of the price, but they were BYOB and I just happened to have a flask of vodka on me for pre-gaming the show. Not having to sneak it sold us. Well, the food was pretty great, but I still think it's way more expensive than it should be. The look of the place was great, but there weren't really any comfortable places to sit. I felt kinda awkward the whole time. Despite the food being great, I think the discomfort is enough to deter me from coming back. The food at the Bottom Lounge ended up being just as good and I regretted not just getting food there!"
"The squash and orange dumpling were unbelievably good.  We also had the mushroom pho, edamame and eggplant and they were all delicious.  Other than the location which is out of the way (from the loop business district), this is great place to return to.  The communal table can get a bit awkward, bit it was still worth it."
The Pea Shoot fried rice is my favorite. If you are vegan you can get this without egg. I usually do. I tried the Mushroom Pho once but it was way too salty for me. They have these salted caramel and sesame coconut macaroons which I strongly recommend. They are soooo good!
"We were really excited when Urban Belly opened in the West Loop. Less excited after having our first meal. The pork dumplings were great but the wagyu beef were odd, both flavor wise and texturally. Hubby had the phat rice, which I preferred to my pad thai. The rice cakes just didn't work. They were chewy and lacked flavor and weird. Prices weren't bad and we could really tell freshness of the ingredients man those rice cake things were just weird."
"Maybe it's because we had a cold, harrowing trip to and from Cleveland the night before, but we really craved soup, and I had already been to this place in its previous location on North California.The location is decent...out of the way of the hard-to-find parking Randolph restaurant row. We ordered the seafood, mushroom, and kimchi soup bowls. They really hit the spot on a very cold Saturday night. Since it was only my second time there, I really can't compare it to the last time I was there. The texture of the meats, seafood, and veggies was delicious. The onions were not overcooked, and the ambiance was relaxed--despite the more upscale look to this newer location."
"Nice location, nice food, chic ambience, and ramens (I love!) Rustic decor and overall a nice place to even go for a lazy weekend brunch. Must try their cold coffee - one of the best I've had!"
"Came in on a wintry day to find the dining area closed for a private party, so opted for take-out. I've been dying to try this place after reading the stellar reviews about the ramen and was super-excited when it moved to my neighborhood. But I forgot about the new ramen fad in the city which prompted many new ""ramen"" restaurants, none of which resembles the traditional Japanese ramen I associate with the name. This is nowhere close to the Japanese variety...more of Chef Kim's own interpretation. While the broth was flavorful, it did not have the richness I was expecting from ramen broth. The two pieces of grilled pork belly were down right boring. And there wasn't much more in that bowl other than noodles. Guess I was misled by the term ""ramen"" so it was a huge letdown for me. The dumplings were just ok too...I personally found them a bit greasy. The filling was flavorful enough which made the sauce completely unnecessary.We of course didn't get to experience service, but at least the ladies who took our order were nice & friendly."
