Pl-zen
"As I entered the restaurant, I was pleased to be greeted with an artsy decor, inviting bar area, and a welcoming wait staff. The basic block tables and chairs shift focus to the murals on the wall which depict the neighborhood and it's industrial influence. The space is smaller than I expected, but there was plenty of room for all the patrons to socialize easily. In addition, there is a small outdoor space for those who want to enjoy the colorful vibe of 18th street.This upscale food bar with a Mexican flavor is a newly discovered gastric gem. Dressed up bar burgers, tacos, and tostadas are only a few of the delectable dishes offered here. Most every dish includes an  assortment of vegetables, avocado, tomatillo sauce, jalapenos, and sour cream. The freshness of the ingredients in each dish bursts with flavor.Finally, the service was second to none. The wait staff was attentive, cordial, friendly and very accommodating. Pl-zen is a creative gastro-pub with a unique atmosphere. Our dining experience could not have been better! We enjoyed delicious food, outstanding service, the ambiance was casual yet unique, and the value was not unreasonable. I invite you to enjoy the same."
"Had a delicious dinner here. The guacamole & horchata were also amazing, as was are very friendly and informative server (I'm terrible for not getting his name)My original dish was a seafood pasta that I was super excited about. I absolutely cannot handle anything spicy, so typically with hispanic foods I ask if they're spicy. Since this was a pasta dish I didn't think to do so. It ended up being too hot for me to handle. It seemed great otherwise, but I just couldn't handle it. :(The reason I'm giving 5 stars is because I was still treated in a friendly and respectful manner after having to order something else. I know it was an expensive dish to make, so I felt terrible having to get something different. I ended up with some delicious fish tacos!We will definitely be going back!"
"Love this place! It's local to us so hubby and I try to visit occasionally. Food is amazing, one of the few places where I don't mind eating onions and waiting a bit for my meal. Service is always above and beyond, Adriana wins the best server award! Warm and inviting atmosphere with pleasant decor, we have some super shabby restaurants in Pilsen so this is breath of fresh air. Their burgers are the bomb and the mussel appetizer is To. Die. For. Love love love. Overall, I've always had a good experience here and will continue to return."
"3.5 for the food but I'm rounding up because service was excellent.  I saw this place on Chicago's best and have been wanting to visit since then.  I started with a hibiscus margarita which wasn't that great to me but I also have a cold so the meds may have thrown my taste buds off.We shared the short rib mac and cheese, and it was very good (as was the pl-zen burger).  Definitely worth a try if you're in the area!"
Excellent burgers! Love the Pl-zen and Kobe burger!
Blown away - cannot believe I've lived around the corner from here for the past 6  months and Just now tried this place. Honestly gives any of the other worth while restaurant in Pilsen a run for their money. turkey feta burger was seriously one of the best burgers I've ever had.
Come on Wednesday to a burger that isn't on the menu!! About to have me a Bambazo Burger! All the burgers are Mouthwatering!! The staff is great! You will be pleased.
"Wow, who knew this hidden, basement-level spot could pack so many flavors into its food and drinks?! Completely unexpected.We happened upon Pl-zen when my wife's coworkers invited us to dinner in their 'hood. We were greeted promptly and served quickly! We came for the Tuesday $15 special - chef's choice of burger, a beer and a shot of bourbon all for fifteen smackaroos. Great deal, PLUS you get fries, which isn't mentioned in the special. The special burger this evening was Asian-inspired - it had slaw, pulled pork and more on top of a grass-fed patty. I opted for the veggie burger, which is a free sub for us non-meat-eaters. Everything was superb! The taps here are where it's at, though. Rare, delicious, high ABV beers all under $8 beckon. I'll definitely be back to Pl-zen when I'm in the area (which, sadly, isn't frequently.) But after hearing about their brunch from someone who visits this place quite frequently (she's on a first-name basis with 90% of the staff!), we'll make a point to visit on the weekend during brunchie hours."
"The food isn't bad at Pl-zen. The atmosphere, I like. Set slightly below ground level with a long narrow corridor entrance, you feel like you're entering someplace COOL. The original artwork inside--bold and provocative--reinforces this first impression. But what is NOT cool about Pl-zen is the wait time between ordering and eating. The food takes FOREVER to come out to the table, and by the time it does, it's cold! This was our experience with both brunch and dinner. The flavors and presentation are there, but timing is an area of Pl-zen's service that they really need to work on."
"I don't write reviews very often but eat out a lot and usually check in and/or rate my experience. THIS encounter, however warranted a quick write up. I had really been looking forward to trying this Pl-zen. My friend and I decided to come for brunch after a 5K because we were starvingI'm sitting here now simply disappointed. What follows is a list of things that happened that turned us off:-her water glass was dirty. She asked for another...it was dirty too-my coffee was Luke warm at best -they weren't very accommodating- she wanted to take part in the bottomless mimosa brunch but doesn't like OJ. She asked if it could be switched to cranberry juice instead. They said that would be considered a Bellini and we would be charged for each one. We declined. -I ordered the meat omelette. The steak tasted funny - like it was leftover. I ate around it. -the pancakes were doughyBut the service was decent. I liked Illiana. She was very pleasant. I will not be back. And, if you can go elsewhere - do!Suffice it to say:  I could've had a V8."
"I didn't know much about this place going in, but was pleasantly surprised and highly satisfied.  Based on appearance, I pegged it for merely a glorified bar; but the menu is somewhat more sophisticated, though without egregiously higher prices to match.  Best of all, the food turned out to be excellent, so I would chalk this up as a great value and unexpected gem.  Plus the service was really sweet. too.To start off with, I ordered the cocktail of the day, which included gin, St Germain, green tea, lemon juice, chia seeds and maybe one or two other ingredients which I've forgotten.  It was pretty good, especially for the price.The brussels sprouts side was our only disappointment, but a mild one.  We asked to omit the bacon, and the sprouts were steamed, which does not bring out the inherent flavors of the vegetable like roasting or frying.  But still, there was a nice balsamic glaze, and a mediocre brussels sprout is still worth eating.Other than that, the food was outstanding.  I absolutely loved the calamari, which was not as crisp as it could have been but also was not sodden with grease like at most places.  The batter had a really engaging flavor, and I could have eaten the calamari on their own, but the accompanying sauce was delicious too.  The fish tacos were really good, the sesame seeds enhancing an otherwise traditional preparation.  I never order a veggie burger in a restaurant, but theirs sounded so compelling that I couldn't resist.  It was delightful--mushrooms, onions, guacamole, and all the other ingredients singing together in beautiful harmony.The burger came unexpectedly with a giant pile of fries, making this meal an even better value.  (Plus the fries and accompanying special ketchup were as great as the rest of the food.)  Our bill came to only $50 for two appetizers, two entrees, a cocktail, and tax.  That was money very well spent.We don't get down to Pilsen very often, but Pl-zen is now permanently bookmarked in my restaurant cortex."
"I was here not too long ago.  This place made a wonderful first impression.  I've always passed by this place and never had a chance to stop in.  I went on tuesday (or was it wednesday) when they had their burgers and bourbon special.  This place is an amazing fusion between modern American cuisine and Mexican cuisine.  Brilliant.  I didn't have a chance to pick the staff's brain about the chef, but he/she is positively brilliant.  Ambiance: wonderfully casual. There is a long corridor with murals (along the entire building actually) and dim,warm lighting that leads into the restaurant. Furthering my anticipation.  The staff is friendly and very warm.  There are smooth wooden tables and high top tables, and a tiny and intimate patio.  It's open and inviting. The staff is very well versed in the menu offerings and are willing to make adjustments to the menu items.  Thank you for your flexibility, chef.  I know I would personally hate it if someone wanted to adjust a menu item the way I wrote it!  I tip my hat to you for that.  (no, I didn't ask for adjustments, my friend did. ::eyeroll::)The food: if you study the menu, the menu is a wonderful marriage of the cuisines I mentioned.  I cannot remember right off the top of my head the specifics of the items, but it has a very classic bistro layout with small bites, entrees, burgers and dessert.  It has a very lovely selection of cocktails, craft beers and Mexican beers.  Personal experience:  I had a pork belly burger.  This beautiful burger had a brioche bun that, in my humble opinion is EXACTLY what a fucking brioche bun should be: wonderfully fluffy, but toasted to perfection and thick enough to hold a damn juicy burger patty.  Atop this glorious patty was molten chihuahua cheese, and pork belly that had been seasoned with Al Pastor flavor and had the ever present (and mandatory) pineapple, cilantro and onion.  I ordered my patty medium.  It was in fact, medium. This came with a side of lovely, extra crispy, well seasoned fries and a side of SPICY ketchup.  This was so good!  The portions and sizes of the meal were generous. This was paired with Pacifico beer (a very light amber ale which was the recommendation but of course you are allowed to pair it with whatever you please) and my chilled bourbon. What a wonderful place this is, and I will certainly recommend this place and return. By the way, the service is outstanding and attentive. Such a warm and kind lady and super polite.  She kept on checking on our table and was very kind enough to split the bill in half even though I (stupidly) forgot to ask her."
"This place has very delicious food. The staff is very nice too. Especially if you like sea food, I would recommend to eat their mussels (small plates) if you are not that hungry. They are in cherry sauce and the dish comes with two slices of bread. I also tried their gnocchi, it is very filling. It was a little bit hot but was super delicious."
"This was one of my favorite stumble upon finds in Chicago! After a long day of walking the city my boyfriend and I were looking for a place in the neighborhood that we could grab a late dinner bite at and we passed Pl-zen. Its not a place that sticks right out amongst the rest of the buildings bc it has a seating area that is kind of below the sidewalk and I was a little weary at first but am so glad that we dined here. We both had the Lemon Meyer margaritas and they were outstanding. Rafa was our bartender/server since we dined at the bar and he is great. He really knows the food, his recommendations were on point and his drinks were fantastic. We had 4 of them! We ordered a little bit of everything from the homemade guacamole with pineapple (I wanted to lick the bowl) with fresh made tortilla chips, short rib burger, Brussel sprouts & the tiger shrimp mac and cheese EVERYTHING had so much flavor and was so fresh. I wish that I had room for dessert. Not only was the food delicious you could tell that everyone that worked there cared about what they were serving and how it was served. Impeccable service.  I highly recommend Pl-zen and wish I was local so I could dine there more often!"
Neither me and my friend had heard of or tried this place before. We decided to eat here as we were walking by. I really enjoyed my dinner and will definitely going back in the near future. It's somewhat a Mexican fusion place. We got their shrimp quesadillas for appetizer which were amazing! They were pretty spicy but you will love it if you like spicy foods. For entrees we ordered shrimp tacos and tilapia tacos. The shrimp tacos had a really spicy and tangy sauce which was tasty. The tilapia tacos were not spicy but definitely worth it also. Overall I was very satisfied with this restaurant. Our server checked up on us whenever we were out of drinks. We also sat outside since the weather was beautiful. Must give this place a shot!! You won't be disappointed =)
"I've eaten at Pl-zen dozens of times. Food and service have always been good. But tonight, my mind was blown!Xavier, who was our server, made this experience at Pl-zen today insanely great. He was friendly, personable, and overall just a great guy. He sang, he did a dance (twice) while talking about the Mexican chocolate brûlée, and he even hugged my mother in law and wished her a happy Mother's Day. The food was spot on as usual, but Xavier made the dining experience better ten fold. I hope he's there next time I go."
"Every Friday night, friends and I get together for dinner.  We try to support local businesses and found  PL ZEN online and liked the menu.  Our  dining experience was a big disappointment.    First the restaurant is located in a  basement with very poor lighting. .  The online menu was outdated (2012) and the entrees that drew us there were no longer available.    To make things worse the lack of acoustics and a table of loud customers made it impossible to carry on a conversation. at your own table. Food was just okay and have decided that we will not be returning."
"The food is good we will come again for sure, can't wait to taste something else... We got the bone Marrow which was really good, chicken wings were ok but the sauce was very tasty, Jalapeño burger was ok, it was hart to taste it and jalapeño not spicy but sweet?? If you expect seething spicy the wings will do....Waiting for our next visit...."
"Ordered the Pl-zen burger with truffle fries. Pl-zen burger was $16 but if you want to add truffle fries it is an additional $3. If you are on the fence whether to pay the additional $3 to upgrade to the truffle fries or not, listen to my advice and get the truffle fries and you will not regret it. They were so delicious and complement the burger so much better than regular fries could. The staff were extremely friendly, and made an effort to make sure I was comfortable/taken care of although I was just got take out."
"Very nice food that has some gesture to the neighborhood but with a nice new spin - short rib tostadas, etc. The drinks were nice and the servers were friendly. The space is comfy as well. The prices are reasonable for the quality and the food. Would go back for sure."
"This burger joint has become my favorite south side burger joint. I am from the North Side but like trying out new places whenever I get a chance. Let me start of by saying crazy how this area has changed in just a few years gentrification at it's finest this area has become HipsterVille.The restaurant is very neatly located. I love the set up and how it's located in the basement but at the same time you can eat outside if the weather permits.The waitresses are awesome very nice, helpful and informative. The make you feel at home as soon as you come in.Apparently the owner is a former cook from the famous north side burger joint Kuma's Corner.I've tried their Salmon burger and their Kobe Burger. Both were awesome but I have to admit the Kobe Burger was better. I eat like a fat boy but no I didn't try both on the same day. lol. It was on different occasions. The fries were awesome! Overall I highly recommend this place.PS my friend tried the Bone Marrow and Loved it as well."
"Yessssss. This place rocks! We went on Easter Sunday, so it was pretty empty. Good thing, we had tickets to Furious 7 and didn't want to run late! Our wairess was super nice, and it was a neat spot. I ordered a mojito, hot damn was it strong! My friend had the Niña Fresa, which had whiskey, so I was wary. Hiwever, you couldn't taste the whiskey since it was sweet, like a dacquiri. For dinner, we had calamari, shrimp tacos and shrimp quesadilla. DE.LI.CIOUS. i cannot rave anymore about the food. The shrimp was spicy, and the calamari was crisp and not fresh. The service the rest of the evening was on point! I will definitely be returning, I heard the tilapia burger is great- I need to checl it ou!"
"The beer selection is great, both on tap and otherwise. The drinks are yummy. My friend and I went for brunch hoping to try one of their burgers, which is what they seem to be known for. There was only one burger on the menu for brunch which I thought was a bummer. Also brunch seemed to run late there. We sat down around 1:30 which seemed like they could have switched to a lunch menu by then. The brunch burger was this: grass feed beef, duck bacon, arugula, queso fresco, fried egg, briocheQuoted straight from the menu. Notice it says ""brioche"" there on the menu. So I was thinking the burger would be on a brioche bun. Sadly, it was not. It was on brioche french toast! So you have two very delicate french toast slices with cinnamon as buns. Points for trying to be original but the taste was not good. The cinnamon on a burger was wrong. The french toast slices, bread already soaked in eggs and milk, were too delicate and fell apart immediately. The duck bacon tasted like regular turkey bacon, nothing special. Queso fresco does not melt so there was no creaminess in this burger. The meat had a good flavor but that was the highlight. It should really say on the menu, ""brioche french toast"" so you know what you are getting into. I would go back and try their regular burgers because the vibe is great and the drinks are awesome but beware the Brunch Burger!"
Love this place!The food is decent. I wish they would rotate their burger selection a bit more.Beer selection is great. The wife loves their margaritas.Service is awesome!
"Best burger in Chicago. By far no place compares and the best part of this place is not the modern decor, the great ambience or the quality food it's the amazing and friendly owner. Just a great place to go and highly recommended."
"What a wonderful experience, I will guarantee you that I need to be back. Adriana was our waitress and her service, recommendations and attentions are outstanding. The ambience and decoration make it cozy and familiar. Highly recommended."
Came here for the first time for drinks for a friend's bday.  The décor is very cool and the food was delicious.  I tried the Duck Carnitas tacos and they were delicious!
"The BBB (burger, beer, and bourbon) deal is awesome. Had the grassfed burger with pork tenderloin and crispy onion straws and it was delicious! Also tried the Diabolo burger and that has a nice sweet taste with the grilled pineapple and then a bite with the serrano pepper! Both burgers were outstanding! Good spot to chill with friends :)Adriana (or Adri) is the best waitress!! So friendly and welcoming! It makes me want to come and visit her too! They also added new beer taps so it should be even better now!"
"Great place. So my brother and I got off work late and need a place with food and drinks and PI-zen came up on yelp plus it had good reviews. So we decided to go. We got there within seconds of the kitchen closing and they still served us-amazing because we were starving. Our bartender/ server was Xavier. He guided us to our dinner which was a turkey burger and cod meal. And then to top off the night he made us an AMAZING spicy margarita. Who ever is reading this and likes spicy drinks please see Xavier! Our meal. The turkey burger was not over cooked. It was moist and the flavor was good with the aioli sauce.  The cod was good as well. I only had a bite but my brother did not complain. Oh we also had the sweet potato fries. These fries were different they had  cinnamon on them, so it tasted like sweet potato pie fries. All in all I would return."
"The mango con chile here is soooo good--- tequila and mango puree with a chili rim--- had to order two! The octopus carpaccio was also pretty good--- my first time having raw octopus, but I would definitely order it again at another restaurant if they do it as good as Pl-Zen.But the other dishes were just okay. The Diabolo burger was too greasy--- actually caused my date's stomach to hurt later that night. I definitely couldn't have more than one or two bites of that burger. I had the black tagliatelle, as suggested by the waitress. I actually really didn't like this dish. Nothing spectacular. And man I really hate eating seafood in the Midwest sometimes, because you need a magnifying glass to find the meat in the mussels, and the shrimp are like midget shrimp. But I always order seafood hoping that I'll find something decent every once in a while. Silly. The sauce wasn't bad... but again, that's why this place just gets 3 stars--- it's just A-OK. There is a lot of interesting artwork in the place--- very Pilsen-like. I would pass on coming here a second time though."
"Pl-zen is a great new addition to the Pilsen neighborhood.  It's like no other restaurant in the area.  Just follow the handwritten sign down a dark ramp to find the entrance.  The restaurant has an urban-artsy kind of vibe with its industrial lighting, structured furniture, and different pieces from various artists on the walls.  It's like some place you would find in the Wicker Park area.My sister and I stopped in to grab some dinner on a Thursday night.  The place wasn't too packed so we were able to snag a seat.  Like other yelpers stated, the service here was a bit slow but I don't think we minded too much because we were probably too into our conversations.  For food, we ordered a couple of items to share:Chipotle Chicken Soup (rotating soup of the day): a creamy chipotle soup with chunks of chicken and potatoes, topped off with some tortilla strips.  This is a very comforting type of soup.  The creaminess and hint of spiciness is great to warm you up on those cold wintery days. Calamari: ancho-flour dusted, epazote, and lemons served with chipotle mayo and 3 garcia silver cocktail sauce.  This is one of the best calamari appetizers I have ever tried.  The ancho-flour coating was not over bearing, so you can still taste the calamari while still having that hint of spiciness crunch. Diablo Burger: grass fed beef, cilantro, grilled pineapple, heirloom tomatoes, white cheddar, and serranos on a pretzel bun.  Served with truffle fries.  This burger is as delicious as it sounds.  The patty was cooked at a perfect medium rare, so it was still tender and juicy.  Once you bite into this burger, you'll notice an explosion of different flavors and textures tickling your tongue.  The sweetness from the pineapple and tomatoes toned down some of the spiciness from the serranos, so don't be too scared of the peppers.  The truffle fries that accompanied the burger were also good.I have to take 2 stars away for their slow service, but the unique entrees and the comfy atmosphere will bring me back here again.  Maybe not when I'm on a time crunch.  The servers here are extremely nice, but they need to put some pep in their step or hire more workers.  It is kind of ridiculous to have a two and half hour meal with just two people."
"This was such a cool place that I happened on by accident. My dining companion and I were leaving another restaurant and saw a sign that said $5 for glasses and $20 for bottles. It was an early night, so we proceeded down the ramp to Pl-zen!This place had the coziest feel and we were greeted with smiles. We decided to sit next to the bar at one of the tables. The bartender was great. Gave us a breakdown of what's what from wines, beers, and food. Let us make our selection and then ensured we had ""bottomless"" glasses of wine. It was great how professional yet how friendly the bartender was (boo at me for not remembering the name).Now mind you the space is on the smaller side. I don't know how I'd feel on a Saturday but for Thursday it was perfect!Specials: Thursdays, $5/glass, $20 Bottle (ALL SELECTIONS). Tuesday, $15-B-B-B, beer, burger, bourbon. I haven't tried that deal, but he said it's usually something really good and filling and changes week to week. May be worth a try!"
"Love love love this place! I was sold when I saw that the beer menu is longer than the food menu. Great selection and a lot of draughts I hadn't tried. Food was great--I had duck carnitas tacos and the brussel sprouts, which are in a bacon/balsamic glaze. Boyfriend had a Pl-zen burger and truffle fries, which were delicious. We almost missed the cocktails, but grabbed a hibiscus margarita before leaving (delicious and packs a punch).Service was wonderful--everyone who walked by asked how we were doing. My favorite part was the decor--cool wall paintings very much in keeping with Pilsen's arty mural-covered vibe. Will be back!"
"pros: dim lighting, a lot of nice art.All the workers check on you and are very friendly! i appreciate great customer service when I see it. I didn't have to ask for more water my whole time being therecons: the burger i ordered was small. maybe i was hungry and i eat a lot, but for 16 dollars my burger was very tiny. i was still hungry after i leftoverall their customer service will convince me to come back and try other things in their menu"
"I've been here a couple of times and it was pretty good. Cool murals on the wall, indoor/outdoor seating if the weather is good, and tasty food. I've come for just drinks and hanging out once, and for brunch another time. Breakfast burger is really good, I'm a big fan of eggs on burgers. Friends say the breakfast skillets are also delicious. They recently had a brunch deal for an entree with unlimited mimosas for $25; if I thought I had the tolerance to drink that value without getting belligerent I'd take them up on it, but I'd like to return so I'll stick with a finite number of alcoholic beverages."
A good place to get a burger.Con: I wish they had different bread for the burger :/.
French toast was too good to be true. The strawberry sangria gave it flavor-- no need for syrup.The eggs Benedict were delicious. The crispy chorizo gave the eggs and pork a nice crunch and spiciness to it.The duck bacon and pork sausage were crispy and savory. So delish for brunch. No waiting in line and good customer service.
"I really wanted to like this place. I really did!!! I had heard nothing but great things and everyone I asked said to get a burger because they are THE BEST(!!!) there. I got the Kobe because someone at my table recommended it. Sure, the menu is a bit pricey but if the burger is as good as everyone swears it is, then it's totally worth it, right? wrong. I've never been so dissatisfied in a burger in my whole life. I'm not a picky eater but I at least require that my food be edible! Let me start by saying that the burgers there are HUGE! So of course you have to cut it in half to eat it. I ordered my burger ""medium"". I got was ""super well done."" It just tasted burned and flavorless. I took two bites. The first bite told me that this is just wrong. I tried to give it another shot so i took another bite. That cemented it...worst burger ever! I had to down an entire cup of water to get the taste our of my mouth because it was making my beer taste charred. The fries were okay but honestly, they weren't worth 15$. I think it's really hard to mess up a burger but some how Pl-zen did it. In case you're wondering, why didn't i send it back? I don't send food back. I'd rather leave hungry than with food poisoning. The bartender was great and super nice but I definitely won't be going back there."
"Tried this place fot brunch. Mimosas and atmosphere were great, food was ok. I initially thought the place was kid friendly since there were alot of families. I was disappointed to see there was no changing table available. Since the restaurant is located on a lower level, I had to change my baby on a cold floor. Needless to say I wont return with my child."
"I had an epiphany about the menu a couple weeks ago. Came with some friends, and I was very hungry but not in the mood for a burger. I normally avoid any restaurant's menu items under the ""Small Plates"" category unless I'm doing tapas-style sharing, but since I was super hungry I decided to get two things under the ""Small Plates"" heading. The waitress gave me sort of a funny look but I didn't think twice about it.Then when the food came, it turned out that each ""Small Plate"" could've been a meal on its own. My previous review gave 4 stars instead of 5 due to the high price of the burgers, but now that I know how much food you get on the more reasonably priced ""Small Plates,"" the menu will be much more versatile. I'm a fan."
"This is one of my new favorite burger places to splurge on. Everything about this place is great.After hearing so many good things about this place I came here for the first time with some  friends to grab a few drinks and a bite to eat.  The burger was the best and their music was just my style (interpol, vampire weekend, camera obscura, yeah yeah yeahs). If you're around Pilsen come try this place"
"Walked in here without any need to call ahead on a Saturday evening. Heard from Yelp that the food was delicious--that was certainly the case. Enjoyed the chorizo burger, and I highly recommend the brussels sprout side dish. One caveat: though the menu doesn't state it, they serve fries with the burgers. I wish our server had told us that, because that would have saved us from ordering a superfluous side order."
worts place  bad actitud from bartender & waitress make you feel like you are not welcome   there pilsen.....today was a event for movimiento tv to promote their placei order fries & italian doghnuts  was okafther we order eat & paid some ppl start gettin in.....& they have problem to acomodate  the coustumers and  she said things are out of controlso she said i need the table you guys have to move....????? whats grong w/ heri order paid hellooooo !!!!!!..... but the waitress  hashhhhh never go back is to many  places in pilsen  to choose from nuevo leoncarnitas uruapan los comaleslupitas restaurantel venenoetc etc etc   booooo !!!!!!
Adriana & Cesar are the absolute best! Anything on the menu- food or drinks- is so freaking delicious! Chorizo burger is soooooooooooo good.
"First of all I love that they have late open dates. The good did take a while to come out but it was worth the wait !I has the pilsen burger and let me tell you, it's was mouthwatering. Besides the good burgers and my  pleasant waitress I simply love the art that they got going on.im hopping to go back soon"
"I have lived in Pilsen for a few months now and had heard great things about this gastropub, but finally decided to check them out last night. Our experience was amazing! The dining area extends outside to a porch and is very inviting. Both our waitress and the busboy were warm, informative, and observant of my tables needs. We started with the $5 draft deal. I ordered the Hell or High Watermelon (which comes with a juicy watermelon slice on the glass!) and for an app ordered the roasted marrow bones. WOW. Delicious and beautiful presentation! The plate was drizzled with a  jalapeño pesto and a few sprouty greens, and the bones were also covered in short rib marmalade which was sweet, juicy, and a surprisingly plentiful portion for 2, and garlic toast points with which to scoop out said savory fat and marrow. We also ordered the specially burger which came topped with housemade macaroni. I ordered it cooked well and it was juicy! Even the fries were crisp and well seasoned. We will definitely be back."
I've been here twice and both times everything has been excellent. From the amazing artsy vibe to the excellent service and of course the amazing food. This place is a must go to!!
"Really sad I have to do this. I like this place and I want it to survive.My husband and I had been coming here regularly (almost once a week for a while), but our love affair has fizzled.A few reasons for this:Service. Everyone's always really nice, but man, this place is slow. On a not-busy Saturday night (seems this place is never hopping), it took a full two hours to have a meal. We drank our beverages down before someone took our order, waited forever for our food, then sat with dirty plates while we tried to make ""OK, come on now"" eyes at every employee who walked by. The last three times we've been, hubs was served a beer other than the one he ordered, so it doesn't seem like the staff is too knowledgable. Food. The more I try other similar places, the more I feel like Plzen is run of the mill. Hubs and I had a meal at a newly opened establishment in the neighborhood (which I'll refrain from mentioning so I don't sound like I'm shilling for them), and we felt like the cost there was comparable but the food and beer list were bigger and tastier than Plzen. If you go to Plzen, the food will be fine. But there's some other places stepping up their game, so in comparison it doesn't look as great."
"Very disappointing experience after being recommended to have dinner at Pl-zen. The service was the only good thing about the night.It was freezing in the restaurant for starters. It was a cold night outside, but I would expect the building to be heated...? I was very underwhelmed by the food-Mussels: literally smelled of manure, I did not eat any, had to move the plates away from the table to get the smell awayGnochhi: tasted as if the tomato sauce came from a canBurger: the burger was actually pretty good, but did not make up for the rest of the bad food/experienceI had hoped for a better experience, but I will definitely not be returning if given the choice again."
"Has this place changed owners?  I don't recognize it from the reviews on yelp.I went on a Saturday with 4 people and the place was not crowded.Service: 20 minutes to get coffee. Asked us a bunch of questions about how we'd like our food prepared and then they ignored our answers (I think the waitress understood limited English).Food quality: coffee bad, chiliquiles mushy and peppery (why not use corn tortillas?), mimosa brought around in a carafe where all the ingredients settled and the waitstaff had no clue. All of the dishes were warm at best. It appeared they were having trouble cooking for more than two people at a time. Atmosphere: painting of a skateboarder jumping over a little kid, other urban pics. I get it, you have a relative who paints and who are you to say no, even though it has nothing to do with the restaurant. Brick walls all around, so loud is the theme. I felt like there is a major disconnect here. The mission of any restaurant should be, above all, to please their customers. Hiring friends and family who are marginally interested and speak little English, bad decision. Hiring kitchen staff that do not taste the food they cook,  bad decision. There are a number of places around town that do not get the fundamentals, this is one of them."
"Went in here with a friend. It's my second time here and I really love it! I ordered the Pambazo as I heard to stay away from the burgers but I might give them a try in the future. Pambazo was good. Came with a side of fries. They do have awesome sweet potato fries. I can eat those forever! As for drinks they do have a good list. I myself am a cider freak so I tried their hard BlackBerry cider. It's my new fave! They also have a tamarind margarita that's delicious.I like how this place doesn't get crowded. I went almost at closing on a Saturday and it wasn't crowded at all. I noticed how other people review this place as slow. I didn't notice it being slow. Then again I was talking to my friend and didn't notice how long it took for our food to come out. Waiters here are friendly, great service, and good food. I will be back...soon. I want to try brunch here!"
"Amazing service to start. Friendly, welcoming and wholly accommodating staff!  They were more than happy to oblige my son to perfection. They made him his own Kobe slider with pretzel bun. We each had our own dish. Knowing the burgers were noted to be one of the best, we each tried something different. I had my favorite bison burger which was called the Pl-zen burger on brioche. Another had the Kobe burger. Another had the short rib sliders on pretzel buns. The 4th had the steak which was a special this night. We subbed regular fries for truffle/parmesan and sweet potato fries. Outstanding dinner!  We had a few drinks. I had the hibiscus margarita which was light and tasty and not too sweet. The other had the mojito and a 3rd had a beer special. We topped our meal off with the tres leches cake and donuts with strawberry sauce. This was my favorite tres leches cake I've ever had. I highly, highly recommend this joint and will be returning soon to try the other items."
"I like this place, but there was one thing that bothered me: slow serviceFood was good and drinks were good, but it just took a little long to get what we ordered.Came over on a Wednesday evening and it wasnt packed so I am not sure what the issue was, but the servers were really nice. We ordered the bone marrow which was good as I am not one that likes the idea of eating it...not badWe also ordered the duck lollipop wings which was cool, but the breading on the meat was a little too much...a sauce came with it that was pretty good.The drinks were fab as we ordered tequila drinks recommended to us by a guy named DC Crenshaw as his tequila Wansas was the featured drink for the evening.The place it self is smaller than I expected, but has a warm feel to it. Street parking is available."
"It breaks my vegetarian heart to do this, but I need to be fair and downgrade my review solely on the basis of how they perform when serving vegetarian options. First off I love this location, the staff are always warm and inviting, the environment is trendy and casual, and when they do deliver on the order it's great. Unfortunately, too many trips have illustrated they do not time a meat meal and veggie meal properly, which causes the veggie option to sit under the hot lights for an excessive amount of time. I've been served very warm yogurt and granola, and countless meals cold that should have been hot. This act of continually dropping the ball on the veg option leads to vegetarians to getting the rap of being annoying to dine with. Vegetarians don't enjoy having to ask for their meal to be remade. We don't enjoy having to awkwardly watch our dining guests as they eat their meals and apologize to them for being a pain. We don't enjoy that once out food does finally come back out we have to scarf it down as fast as possible because our dining partners have long finished their meals and are ready to go. Vegetarians want to sit and eat with our friends, family, and significant others, just like everyone else."
"Charming restaurant location on the east side of Pilsen with a hole in the wall feel complimented by urban art.  Unfortunately the food and service didn't quite match the location.We ordered burgers and fries for a regular dinner meal, The PL-ZEN burger was cooked properly with decent garnishes, but nothing special in the burger world and rather small, especially for the $16 price tag.The vegetarian burger was a disaster, they brought out a beef burger instead, and it took a bite to get through the junk on top of the burger to realize it wasn't vegetarian at all.  The actual vegetarian burger (which is white and should have been impossible for the kitchen to mistake) also falls apart too readily and lacks any real burger feel.The much touted ""Parmesan Truffle Fries"" are just regular fries with no parmesan and a slightly sour truffle oil flavor that falls flat.Server was nice enough to apologize and comp the vegetarian mistake, but the food and the prices just don't add up."
I think this place is over rated. I came with a group of co workers after work and wasn't really pleased. The chicken wings I ordered left a bad aftertaste. As if the wings were old  and rubbery. The blue cheese potato salad was actually good. But the drinks were way overpriced and not strong at all. Also the waitress was rude and we had to keep trying to get her attention.
This is honestly a good experience. I love the Kobe burger and recommend asking Cesar what's on tap. You can honestly sit and read there (as I often do with my psychology articles) and enjoy the music which ranges from Joy Division to Interpol.
"I had a bad experience. I did not get what I ordered, the burger was dry and flavorless, the steak was dry and over cooked, as the chilaquiles were soggy. On top of it, the waiter tried to excuse the kitchen, and argued on behalf of the kitchen, explaining how ""Brioche"" is synonymous with French Toast. Whomever was running the kitchen that day, sent a dessert as a sign of truce, adding to the fact that the kitchen was again choosing for us and telling us what to eat. I will never eat there."
"Tuesdays BBB (beer, bourbon, burger: which changes every week) for $15 can't complain!!!! Service is great, if you're not taking advantage of Tuesday deal dive in here on sat. or sun for there $25 Brunch special $25 entree with bottomless mimosas (while u eat). If you're not taking advantage of there specials I recommend grabbing the Diabolo or Pl Zen burger those are my personal top 2 burgers. Baby Octupus is good, grilled skirt steak, kobe burger............Getting thirsty? besides beer n bottles try the Mango Con Chile (tequila with a kick), NEW ""old"" Fashion (same o fashion with a sweeter taste), or the Nina Fresa (has whiskey enough said)...."
"Had been wanting to swing by here for quite some time, especially after seeing something about them on tv a few months ago.Four stars for:1. Great ambiance...chill place with some pretty interesting artwork2. Service was great...very attentive and helpful3. Now the food....we ordered the following:-Tilapia tacos: OMG I wish we had just ordered more of these after taking my first bite! It's 3 tacos each with one good piece of tilapia that is juicy and topped with some pico de gallo and some other sauce...it's just AMAZING! This was also well priced for it's quantity and in comparison to some of the other stuff on their menu.-Cornished hen: this was alright, not something I'd order again. For 21$ I think I was expecting something a little better and perhaps breast pieces instead of something that was equivalent to 4 generously sized wing-like pieces. It came with mashed potatoes and some grilled veggies. All in all taste was mediocre (a little bland).-Mac and cheese: didn't taste this, but I saw someone else had ordered it and it looked really deliciousGlad we stopped by because it's worth trying and I will come back again even if it's just for those tilapia tacos!"
Great food and a epic brew selection for all. Space is kinda tight. Friendly staff and great atmosphere.
I have been here plenty of times and always enjoy the food and beer menu. Unfortunately I was there yesterday and the service was not good. Waitress made no effort to make us feel welcomed. She rarely checked on us and we had to ask for drinks from another girl. I was under the impression that a waitress should come check on drinks before your glass is empty. That didn't happen! I will probably give it another try. It's all in the attention to details to customer service.
"an amazing place to go with friends and just have a great time. the food is made to order so it may take a while to get to you but its a wait i wouldnt mind. i have been here many times, and i have ordered the steak which is a gigantic piece of meat, tender and oozing with favor. i also get the burger, huge IN SIZE WELL WORTH THE PRICE. I WOULDNT PICK ANOTHER PLACE TO BRING FRIENDS FOR A GREAT TIME."
I had a lovely time with my mom here. I tried the plzen burger and their guacamole with jicama and cucumbers was absolutely delicious. The ambient is pretty laid back and it feels Like you are walking into an art piece when you go down to enter the restaurant. Service is awesome.
"We were directed to this place by the owners of the bicycle shop across the street . It was the best decision we made by going there. We had fish tacos, quesadillas, beers and shots of tequila. The food was so elegantly prepared it needed no extras. The flavors  danced in my mouth. The service was second to none. We were treated with the greatest hospitality and warmth. The ambiance was so cozy and romantic. This is now a ""Date Night"" favorite."
Really really bad service! Burgers always come cold.. Been here couple times giving it second and third chances but give up... To expensive for a cold burger and nasty french fries!!!!!! The waitress there has horrible attitude and not to mention the restroom it's an embarrassment to the Pilsen community I think the bathroom at the community park is more clean.. Horrible! Don't recommended at all.. I rather go to maxwell for a $3 burger
This place is Beyond Nasty the food I had last time got me very sickI woke up the next day with diarrhea!!the waitress here Have very Nasty attitude just like the food!!the bartender/Staff act like if they were in a downtown High class restaurant/bar and thinking they are better than you!!and still expect a tip?? Uhhhhh Yahh we are still in Pilsen (AKA The Hood) and restaurant is in a basement so therefore there shouldn't be any attitude or treating a customer rudely!!!Prices are ridiculous like I said we are still in the hood of pilsen!!#changethemenue#Getnewstaff
"Great, fun time at brunch. Great staff, attentive and super friendly. Coming back for dinner."
Just visited this place with a friend. I love the artwork on the building. I ordered the parmesan fries super yummy and the quesadillas de camarón were so good. My friend ordered the burger she almost lcked the plate clean.Everything is priced reasonably. And the waitresses were super nice to us I didn't catch their name but both of them were super attentive. Definitely a place to stop by if your ever in pilsen.
"Spectacular price/performance ratio.  Thursday nights - $20 any bottle. Not an amazing selection by any means but c'mon, it's $20.Loved the unique dishes. enjoyed the octopus carpaccio and the bone marrow- it was topped with braised short ribs!!!  shared the $20 - 16oz humungo ribeye with my husband.  $77 inclusive of tax and tip is a great date night meal for amazing food!"
"Went here for the first time and we absolutely love it! great addition to the area, the service was lovely and the food and drinks amazing. This place is so good I can't wait to bring my mom here. My date and I had orginally came out to the area to go to Take me out across the street but they closed earlier that night so decided to check out Pl-zen just across the street and Boy!..was that a great call!As soon as we sat down one of our two severs came introduced herself and the other server who would be taking care of us that night.  She explained the specials in great yummy detail, the way she explained the specials made me want to try it all. She was phenomenal,  everytime I come back here (and I definitely will be coming back) I want her to be my waiter. i wish i remembered her name, i remember her face tho she was an older lady, so sweet and kind. Our other server maybe she was having a bad day but she felt very cold and short with us,  but that's ok because my sweet older server blew her out the water. I sure hope my tip went to her and not the other one. Anyway,  for Starters we had the braised short rib quesadillas omg so good! the green salsa was black beans was holy!I had a signature cocktail,  something like chile con mango, that was soooo tasty, I loved it! I had the chicken dish with mashed potatoes, wild rice and veggies. The chicken was cooked PERFECTLY, so juicy, best chicken I EVER had. The dish looked beautiful and tasted amazing! my date had what I believed was called the Pl-zen Burger i forgot all the yummy details besides bacon, but it was very delicious too, was very glad he ordered it so I had a chance to taste their yummy burgers and fries. I honestly can't say enough good things about this place. I recommended this place to one of my coworkers and she went with her boyfriend like two nights later and also fell in love with this place. I can't think of one single negative thing to say about this place so I gave it a perfect score.  Yes one out of my two waiters wasn't as pleasant but omg c'mon I had two waiters and the other one completely made up for the other's unwelcoming nature. check this place out,  I love it and I hope they stick around for a long time. We need to support more places like these in this neighborhood. This place is waay better then the over rated nuevo leon next door. I never understood tge hype of nuevo leon. But anyway this place Pl-zen is fantastic,  honestly can't wait to go back!"
"I love this place. The owner frequently has a presence when we stop in, which is nice because it reflects the quality service and products served.  He is from Mexico City and brings a creative flare to his menu and the overall concept.  He is also very friendly and attentive to guests. The dinner menu has less Mexican flavor influence but if you're looking for that, the brunch menu has roots in Mexican flavors. I love the eggs benedict with mole and braised short ribs and the torta de pierna.The cocktails are awesome and well crafted. There is also an extensive beer list and great draught beer selection. The food is always excellent and a nice change of pace from standard local Mexican cuisine in the area.  I wish it was it my current neighborhood; I would be here all the time."
"An interesting, hip little place. I originally turned my nose up at it because if I am in Pilsen I am loyal to Nuevo León, but with a friend moving away we decided to try something new. They were able to make reservations for a group of five the night of, which was awesome, but we did have to share a table with another small group of three. The drinks here were pretty good and fairly inexpensive, I had the mojito 2.0 which is a fruit infused mojito, friends had beers and hibiscus margarita (highly recommend!). we got our drinks quickly but food took FOREVER. Be prepared to wait. Service could have been more attentive with filling more drink orders, as well. I am still giving this a four though because it wasn't expensive, we loved the drinks, and the shrimp tacos were amazing with their flavor. Everyone loved their food, although someone's fries were a little salty. Other dishes at the table: burger, salad, veggie tacos, and fried calamari. All pretty great."
"This place is so good we went 2 nights in a row! Hibiscus margarita and mango con chile margarita are a must! We had tilapia tacos and shrimp tacos, they were excellent. Going to get back there soon for salmon burger and some sweet potato fries that we saw coming to another table. Staff was super friendly and prices were also very fair so we will be the new regulars here."
"This is one of those places. Those places with small platesThose places with 15+ burgersThose place with small craft cocktails for 10+ Those place with a great interior Those places that are anti my dive bar love. Because I don't like small platesor salads with exotic lettuce, or any of the finer things in life, I have no place in my eating rotation for this establishment. It was just too upscale to win over my hole-in-the-wall heart.  If you like good food and new creations try it out, but if your looking to munch on junk food and have a drink I say skip"
Less than average food as higher than average prices. Truffle oil is a gimmick. Few beers on tap. Other options further from the train are worthy of the walk. Go somewhere else.
"Came to pl-zen again with my boyfriend for dinner. My second time here and this time was even better than the first! We had a woman server this time and she was absolutely amazing! My burger was also cooked absolutely perfect and the food came out very fast. Great food, great service, highly recommend."
"The super slow service is what would hold me back from returning.  Ordered food at the bar to go, and waited almost an hour for 2 burgers and quesadillas.  Ridiculous because it's not even busy.  Told by two different employees the food was coming right up, and still waited 15 minutes.  Service is important!!!!!"
"I havent even tried the food yet, but the service is great and very welcoming. It's a holiday so people who are working are usually rude, not these people! Awesome atmosphere and great for big groups!"
"Great food, excellent drinks, friendly service. Cool atmosphere in a hip neighborhood. The octopus is great along with the mojitos. The bartender was very helpful and gave great recommendations. Give it a try if your in the neighborhood."
"Too many lousey reviews on this place but I loved it.  I think I know why there are all these poor reviews.  I will tell you what I and my fellow diners had and I will give you warnings.  First we ordered the Tostadas for an appetizer instead of a main course because it costed the same as a appetizer.  The tostadas are full of fresh ingredients and amazing; however, you only get two and no sides which may lead someone to be upset paying $12 for this dish, so order it as a appetizer and cut it into pieces to share with the others at your table.  I ordered the macaroni and cheese with lobster and the cherizo type dish which came with fries.  Usually at gastropubs you do not get much food on a plate and that is why I stocked up, but to my surprise I was given a big cherizo sandwhich packed with meat and a huge pile of fresh home cut fries!  The sandwhich and fries were to die for!  I hate ketchup and was puzzled to get a side of ketchup with the fries, I felt insulted at first getting a side of crappy ketchup but then I noticed it looked a little dark in color, so maybe it was different; therefore. I tried it and it blew me away!  The ketchup had a zesty, chipotle flavor that complemented the home cut fries!  The macoroni and cheese had fresh lobster pieces in it, I could tell by the taste.  These two dishes only costed $20 for a ton of food that even my piggy ass could not finish!  My mother had a to die for Ox tail stew and a really good soup.  Her boyfriend had a pork on the bone dish that was so freakin tender and delish!I will warn you about two things here:1.  They are known for their burgers, but they actually suck, DO NOT ORDER A BURGER!2.  They are slow because the food takes a long time to cook due to everything being made from scratch and I mean EVERYTHING!  If you have no patience and do not understand cooking fresh food you have no business eating here or anywhere that makes fresh food, and you need to take your dumb ass to portillos or some crappy place.  Please be patient and be prepared to be here almost 2 hours, but it is well worth it!********************************UPDATE************­***************I went in here on Saturday and this time I ordered a burger to give it another shot.  I had the burger topped with Chirizo.  Wow, was it good!  The burger was delcious and packed with flavor!  They improved the burger for sure!"
Ugh.. ac was broken.  Nothing but an I'm sorry.  Hostess was a nice girl and thats the one star. Went with my bird and her burger was gross and my chorizo skillet was funky.  Probably should of walked when we found out about the ac. Was super bummed
"Great customer service, very nice place but prices are kind of high. I would recommend for a nice date, or hanging out with friends."
"Really love the fried calamari, ask for it with fried lemon! It's the best!  You eat an entire lemon wedge fried and it enhances the flavor of the calamari. Just wow!"
"Really wanted to love this place but won't be back. Upon being seated, I noticed a strong odor that seemed to come and go. Bathroom smell? Sewer gas? I didn't want to say anything because my SO and I were really hungry and he has a weak sense of smell. Did not want to ruin his meal. So we order and before the food started to come out, he says to me, ""Why does it smell like a baby diaper in here?"" Hilarious but we could not figure out where this smell was coming from and no one else seemed to be aware of it.I can't remember what we had as an appetizer but for entrees, I had a bison burger and he had a seafood paella-type dish. My burger was ok but I don't think it was worth the enhanced prices of a ""gastropub"". I had a better burger at a similar place in NYC Hamilton Heights for less money. My boyfriend is fairly easygoing with food quality but as he was eating I saw his face contort. Some of the shellfish in his dish was so fishy he made faces. He said most of the seafood was fine but there were a couple of pieces that obviously had not been washed very well so they were extremely fishy. He ate the whole thing anyway because that is what he does. Between the baby diaper smell and the fishy fish, we won't be going back. Unfortunate, because the place ""looks"" awesome. Was kind of scoping it out for a wedding weekend dining option for out of town guests. Please look into your smell issue and do a better job of washing your seafood."
"Cool little place tucked away in Pilsen. Fish tacos were excellent. BBB special (bourbon, beer, and a burger, for $15) on Tuesdays is a great deal, and delicious. Service was fast, friendly. Beer selection is large."
"Can't say enough good things about this place. Consistent, friendly, charming, affordable and delicious.This is that ""favorite little place around the corner.""Inventive gastropub dishes, flavorful with a knowledgeable staff. Lobster macaroni and cheese paired with a pinot and a garden level view of 18th Street. Great atmosphere and and effortless service.Catch them on $20 bottle of wine night, or $15 burger + beer +bourbon.Order with a blindfold... you can't go wrong."
"A fantastic addition to the neighborhood! Great food, great waitstaff and the owner Cesar is genuine and very friendly. We're regulars at Plzen for many reasons - our favorite night is Thursday evening for 5$ glasses of wine. Any night is great actually as they're usually running a special. There are several great vegetarian options that can also be made vegan. Note: if you go anywhere in Pilsen during 2nd Friday, expect a wait. It's the busiest night in the neighborhood!"
"The vibe is decent- I know not everyone likes art on walls but it's all subjective and I was digging the overall atmosphere of the place.  Tables are classy looking, and even though it's a small location it doesn't feel overly crowded. The biggest downer was the wait time- we were given seats at bar, ordered some good (well priced cocktails) and then transferred to a table eventually by the bartender who assured us we had a waitress.  Not bad except for the transfer part- we didn't know who our waitress was and sat for a while.  Had to eventually aggressively flag someone down for help to get our order in because I'm not sure they ever knew we were without an attendant.  From there things were fairly smooth- as other reviews have commented- the burger is fairly pink even though I asked for medium so this seems to be a reoccurring problem.  The major complaint here is just the time to serve- it took a good 20-30 min for food to come out and it was the same for most patrons we were watching.  I think the place is a victim of its own success- seems overcrowded but undermanned on some level- not anyone's fault just how things are.  Wait staff is super nice and helpful once they are able to get to you, but I think the problem again is just it takes a long time to get fed and out the door because the place is just understaffed and the kitchen is probably too small to handle the demands the place is getting nowadays. As for the food itself, I've had a lot of burgers so it's nothing that blows my mind and makes me a default returner but it is overall a solid burger.  A touch pricey though for a $15 burger that probably could easily swing for $10-12 at most bar places as it's not as distinguished as they I think would like.  The bison burger sounds impressive but is only so-so in my opinion, if I had to pick one, I think my wife had a burger with pork topped on it but is no longer available (menu changes often).  Beeramisu for dessert was fantastic and is easily split between several people. Bottom line:  Try the cocktails, get a dessert, expect to wait a while, not the best bang for buck at the price they are charging but it is a cool looking spot."
The food is delicious! I would highly recommend this place for a night out with friends. They have an assortment of drinks to choose from.
I've become a regular. Love the chilaquiles.
Decent food but Service was horribly slow both at the bar and table.  Bartender was a bit rude as well.  Probably won't be back by choice
I normally sit at the bar and highly recommend a the apps and tiramisu.  They now have drink specials and if your not a fuss bugdet you can have a great time.  So go on in and say hi to Claudia or Cassandra and tell em SKIDZ sent ya.....BTW = the meatballs are T-riffik!
"i live nearby, and went for their BBB (beer/bouron/burger) special on tuesday and had a great experience. the burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and delicious, and i liked the build-out of the space. i didn't experience any service issues that others have complained about--my server ariana was friendly and on top of things from start to finish. will be back!"
"We came here a couple of nights ago on a big family get-together and overall the experience was positive. The food is very good (best meal I've had on my trip here so far) and I think the menu is interesting (bone marrow as an app, which you don't see in casual eateries much). I had a veggie burger (very good, with avocado) and sweet potato fries, which were dusted with cinnamon sugar - yum!. Others in the group had the short rib tostados, watermelon salad, burger, duck tacos, and their mac and cheese and were all raving about their food (well, except for the mac and cheese, but the diner was 4 years old and upset because it didn't get served in a box). Also, I liked the funky decor and the waitstaff were very friendly. Finally, they have a nice selection of microbrews, many from local breweries. BUT, I can't give a 5-star review because we waited over an hour for our food. It was actually about an hour and 20 minutes. I guess maybe the kitchen was shorthanded but with no bread brought to the table it was a long wait. Also, a couple of people in my group thought it was extremely noisy to the point where it ruined their meal. It's true there is nothing in that space that will absorb sound like rugs, but I was sitting in the corner so I guess it wasn't as bad for me. It was loud though - maybe not the place to go if you're trying to have a romantic date. I would definitely give this place a second chance, simply based on how good the food was and the menu."
"Definitely unique, definitely has kinks. Took 30 minutes to get our quesadilla appetizer. Waitress apologized when she brought it but made no effort before to let us know what was going on. I had the skirt steak, husband had the chicken. Skirt steak was charred on the outside red on the inside, dry and tasteless. One piece of chicken was good the other undercooked and inedible. The kitchen has a long way to go. It took two hours for us to get in and out. The staff kept apologizing but didn't offer to comp a thing. Sides (brussel sprouts, caramelized onions and fries) stole the show everything else was mediocre. Really wanted to like this place but can't even give it a second chance."
"Live in the neighborhood and have wanted to drop in but never made it.  Big mistake!  Had the Kobe Burger and my wife the Diablo Burger.  We were both very happy with our food and our server, Anna, was great!  Food delivery was well paced.  Definitely going back soon."
"I try and make it to Pilsen at least once a month. I really love the scene there and especially the dining options. I came here on one of my treks after hearing raving reviews, and after eating, I completely understand why.My boyfriend and I got there around 8:30 on a Thursday and the place was pretty quiet. As we walked toward the back bar area, there were a few people at a table next to us and at the bar.  It was a relaxing atmosphere after a long day at work. We ordered cocktails and the mussels to start, then I had the veggie burger while he had the bacon cheeseburger. The drinks were pretty tasty and strong and the food portions were huge and delicious. We ate as much of our burgers as we could. I was actually really sad that I couldn't finish mine - I think it is one of the best damn veggie burgers in this city. If you are in the hood, check it out."
"went here for the first time on a saturday night about 640pm. no wait. open tables. the restaurant is actually very beautiful and quaint. love the tables. everything about the place is very calm and inticing. we ordered the mango con chile drink and it was so good. not too much liquor but the taste was delicious. my husband had the mojito which was also delicious!! the short rib quesadillas were so so appetizing. we also ordered the surf and turf burger which had a crab cake. the crab cake was good, it wouldve been better with a marmalade or something of the sort but the burger was delicious. the meat was really good. all in all, i loved the place. will definitely be going back. so much more i want to try.my only qualm was that on this night one of the chefs cut his hand and so our food took about an hour to come. i guess the owner had to come and cover for the chef which really slowed down the order process. none the less they were very apologetic and the food made up for the wait"
"Good to see new restaurants in the neighborhood!  the octopus painted outside is so cool!Meatballs and wings were very good.  We didn't like the crab cake burger or the pig's ear salad.  You get large portions and a mountain of fries with burgers, so we couldn't finish everything. We watched other plates go by and the calamari were piled high too.  I wished I had ordered the bison burger, mussels or octopus. Service is a bit spotty.  Waitresses were super nice but I don't understand why it took them so long to pour our two beers initially, and why all four dishes(2 apps and 2 entrees) all came at the same time. We thought plates were sitting out for a while based on the temperature of the hot dishes. Maybe service will get better in time because I want to go back again."
"When you drive past Pl-zen, all you see is a sign in front of a typical city-two-floor-dwelling. But walk down the ramp and you enter a cozy place with some really delicious food, great craft beer selection, and some of the most interesting rotating artwork I have seen. Food: I'm a lover of calamari. As a matter of fact, I'm such a big calamari fan that I relate myself to Johnny Depp's character in Once Upon a Time in Mexico (only I won't kill the chef.) They knocked out my #1 calamari place, and that's a tough feat. We also had the Ribs that came in tortillas shells and delicious green salsa. Then came the burgers. I ordered the Pl-zen, it was delicious!!! I highly recommend it, my boyfriend would recommend the Diabolo (which is on Yelp's Burger Feast Email I recently received) We also tried the Creme Brulee, but unfortunately it was cold and I'm used to it be slightly warm. Beer: Their craft beer selection is good, although it would be nice to have a bigger draft selection. That was my lack of star. Extras: As of right now, i'm aware of a happy hour from 5-7 where it's $5 drafts and half price burgers. Parking isn't bad during the week, but i'm sure it's crazy on the weekends."
"On our way to brunch at our regular spot Nuevo León we came across an hour wait so this place was next door. Yes the menu was a little more than we planned to spend but we noticed some things in the menu we weren't used to nor could we get in the area like duck bacon etc... Too starving to care we all ordered. The chillaquilles were seriously among the best and I've been eating grammas my whole life. The burger was huuuuuuuuuge so big you can't even fit your mouth on it. The French toast was on a very delicious bread. I will say the mechelada was very disappointing but I think the atmosphere, food, and friendly staff made up for it. Sometimes it's worth spending a little bit more for out of the norm food and a beer selection that could keep me here all night. However, i did stop to think....Brunch and packed  .....in Pilsen.... Why were we the only brown people in there?"
"Went to the new gastropub Pl-Zen last Monday and it is a very cool change of place for 18th street in Pilsen next to Mexican staple Nuevo. It opened in mid-October. Its in the basement but seems like above grade. The decor is very straight forward and cozy, with both individual and communal tables.I had the skirt steak which was great. It was slicely on the thin side but cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. It came sliced over a nice bed of fries, which are sweet potato fries but regular fries can be substituted. My friend had the crab cake burger and loved it.They also had an extensive beer list and several on tap, including local brewers such as Revolution brewing. Our server was excellant and very friendly.I would definitely recommend trying this before it gets too trendy and crowded!"
Really great time. Food was delicious. Brussels sprouts top-notch. Pasta great for both of us. Consistently busy all night. Great little lower patio in front probably great in spring / summer.
"Good food, cute place, however, polite but slow service. I had the scallop burger; the scallops were cooked well, the truffle fries were above average too. Service was slow, but attentive. He kept messing up who ordered what, while delivering the food and the check. If I were in the area, I'd go back on a weekday, but stay away on the weekend when it might be busier. I want to say 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up. Good weekday dinner!"
"Came here with two of my girlfriends on a Wednesday night. Every Wednesday night they have a special cocktail that costs $5, this week they have Mint Jupel? Its mint something. Very smooth and refreshing. I actually found this place like a year ago when I went to Neuvo Leon right next door last year  and saw Pl-Zen's special sign of $5 mojito. I'm a huge fan of mojitos so I have to try this place out. Their mojito is very delicious too. This place is very clean and quiet. The waitress Ariana? She was super nice! I will definitely come back. Pilsen is an amazing neighborhood in general :)"
"Very good.  Good music. Server was Ryan.  Really professional,  knew his stuff about the menu. Beer is really good and I hate beer. Bone marrow is pretty much all you need... just the marrow and beer and you are set for awesome."
"Consider this a retraction. I have been to Pl-zen at least three times since my first review and after dining in, I think this place really fills a gap in Pilsen - I can't think of a better place in the immediate neighborhood for a first date or a girl's night out (Simone's usually has a line and is loud and is filled with douche-y hipsters and has terrible service and mediocre food).They had a special for half priced appetizers so we got the octopus carpaccio and it was fantastic, just the right texture and the tomatoes and olives were good acidity. The spicy sauce that goes with the mussels was the highlight of that dish, plus they're very generous with that serving. The tostada entree had a great variety in vegetables, and other than the superfluous paper at the bottom of the plate, I have no complaints about the food.The beer list is also a great mix of craft beers from the midwest. Good prices. 4 beers, 2 appetizers, and 2 entrees came out to $60. If you're looking for a more upscale experience in Pilsen, which is hard to find, this is the spot!"
"I've been to Pl-zen many times and had great food on all tries: Diabolo burger, Veggie burger, Sweet potato fries, Pl-zen burger, Sliders are a few items from their menu that I remember trying and they all tasted great. They do have a wide selection on craft beers as well. This gastropub is a gem in the heart of Pilsen."
"Even one star is too much for this horrendous place.I came to Chicago last week and have been impressed by how nice people are and great food has been UNTIL I went to this horribly pompous, ridiculously deceiving place. I ordered Caesar salad. There it came two tiny heads of lettuce UNCHOPPED. I am not joking! No croutons but just this 2 by 1 inch of burnt garlic bread. Their IPA from tap did taste like it has been sitting there all day as its names says. It had this weird after taste that totally ruins your taste buds. Waiters never comes to you. Nor friendly. I actually had to go to the cashier to pay after waving and waiting forever.  This is BY FAR the worst restaurant I have  ever been to."
"I definitely enjoyed the veggie burger they offered. It's a bit pricey for what you get, but you're also paying for the environment. It's well-built and perfect for the food they offer. Will most definitely return again!"
Wonderful beer list. Eclectic menu. Excellent friendly service. The tostadas did not disappoint. We ventured in not knowing what to anticipate and left with future plans to return and try more of the menu. Awesome little hidden gem.
Food here is great and they have an awesome beer selection. This place is  really nice on the inside. Just watch out tho and ask what's in the dishes because the menu constantly changes. Try the donuts!!
"Super fresh ingredients.  Quality burger, you can taste it.  Great neighborhood spot. Introduced to this spot through the yelp $5 burger week, and will definitely be back for more.  The service was really good as well."
"Shrimp Quesadillas, Turkey Burger, and Truffle Parmesan Fries were AWESOME! I definitely will be returning to this spot."
"This place, man. I don't know what to say. Sure, I live in the neighborhood, but that doesn't explain how I came to be at Pl-zen four times in two weeks. Perhaps I should just run through all of my visits, and then you'll understand.October: Almost stood up for a first date here in the first week or two that they were open. I almost didn't care about the date because I was enjoying my beer (Three Floyds Robert the Bruce) and conversation with the servers.November: My best friend and I really enjoy good food, so I suggested Pl-zen for dinner before a show on the other side of town. While I was underwhelmed by the meatballs, the mussels were the best I've ever had, and my friend groaned with pleasure at the short ribs and gnocchi. We were so enthusiastic - or maybe the servers felt bad about my previous stand up - that we were given a discount on our meal.Recent visit #1: Brunch date the second weekend that brunch was on offer. We ordered way too much food, and managed to eat most of it. The chilaquiles were a little wet but totally delicious. My DLT couldn't decently be eaten as a sandwich, so I ate it with a fork and knife and nearly died of pleasure. My date had the short rib Benedict, and I coveted his every bite. I regretted not getting a Bloody Mary, and will rectify that next time.Recent visit #2: Early NYE date for drinks. The whiskey list isn't deep, but it has some nice selections. I was sad that there weren't more takers for the prix fixe menu, but it was pretty early.Recent visit #3: Dinner. I had the scallop burger - oh god, wonderful - and my date had the steak frites. Again with the sandwich that can't be eaten as a sandwich. The pork belly was perfectly cooked, the pretzel roll delicious, and the texture of the scallop patty far better than I expected. We left full and happy.Recent visit #4: Dinner the night before a half marathon. I had a hard time deciding what would be safe in my stomach before running 13.1 miles and settled on the bison burger. This was my fifth half, and the first one where (sorry) I didn't have major digestive stuff after. In addition to being delicious, the bison burger was clearly the right choice for pre-race fuel!Pl-zen, I love you."
"It must have been an off day.  I don't know how else to explain it.  We were SO looking forward to this dinner.  After reading such wonderful reviews, we were prepared for an excellent experience.  We had travelled nearly 2 hours, we were hungry, and it was cold.  The service was excellent.  Friendly, and genuine.  The space was cozy and welcoming.  The food was a disaster.  Fries were soggy (ie LIMP).  My scallop burger was absolutely tasteless, greasy, and almost inedible.  My wife had the burger which was dry and not very flavorful, although the toppings were a little more tasty.  The salad was good.  The beer was good.  I really wanted to love this place, the quality of both our dishes were inexcusable.  Clearly, others fortunately didn't have the same experience as us."
Great service. Awesome burgers. Expansive beer selection. I had the Pl-zen burger- amazing. My husband had the scallop burger which was also delish. Will def come again and explore more of the interesting menu!
"I was so psyched for a new restaurant in the hood, but the food was a huge let down. Intrigued by the huge tentacles painted on the exterior (no, I don't have Japanese octopus fetish), I've been waiting to finally see what's inside... I now understand the voices of my neighbors in pilsen who ""hate"" ""hipsters"" and ""gentrification""The atmosphere was laid back, the beer selection good and waitress a sweetheart but that's where my positive review ends. The food is mediocre at best and overpriced.We were told if we shared an image of an appetizer via instagram or facebook we would get it on the house. Having both octopus and mussels the other day, we decided to choose the wings. They gave us 3 disturbing and questionably huge soggy fatty wings. I can't believe they would charge $10 for 3 creepy wings.We ordered the Crab ""burger""($14) and Diablo burger ($15) for our entrees. They were edible, but after having not ate all day (now 9pm) anything should have tasted amazing.... yet it didn't.The menu seemed very similar to Simones yet almost double the price.I think it's cool that they support local artists and breweries but the food is way to overpriced for what you get. Jumping on the bandwagon of New American restaurants opening up in Pilsen, they should have a more unique taste.I say either go to Simones for less or pay a few extra $ and go to Nightwood.They seem to be ripping people off under the guise of a trendy facade and ""exotic"" menu items like ""bison"" and ""boar."" The second I walked out the door, I deleted my Instagramed wings. I hope that I came on an off day and ordered all the wrong things, I DO want to support new business in the hood but my experience was that this place is a fraud."
It's refreshing to see a place like this open up in the hood. I grew up in Pilsen and it's about time a place that this exists on 18th! I had the Tilapia tacos and they were tasty. I just wish they offered more sides. Also the sweet potato fries are made with trans-fat which sucks. It'd be awesome if they offered a healthier alternative to that ^__^
