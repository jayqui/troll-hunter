The Roost Carolina Kitchen
"6 starsWent to The Roost for lunch on a Sunday around 12:30. The restaurant is quite small and they cook your chicken fresh to order so be prepared for it to take a little while for your food to come out. But, the wait doesn't matter because the food is SO FREAKING GOOD!I got the spicy chicken sandwich with cheese on a biscuit, with mac n cheese and peach cobbler as my sides. The sandwich was amazing! The chicken is so incredibly good and the biscuit was really soft and fluffy. The chipotle ranch added a great, smoother flavor and you can get pickles and coleslaw too if you want. The mac n cheese was really good, definitely homemade, and the peach cobbler was a great way to end the meal. And maybe the best part, I got all of this for $11.I will definitely be back. This place is a real gem on Irving Park rd and must have some of the best, if not the best chicken in Chicago!"
"Finally did try the Nashville hot chicken out, and it didn't disappoint. It does have some spiciness to it, but I was fine with it, and it reminded me of the level of a jalapeno-style spiciness. Guess I should try the original version at Prince's(where this was inspired from), whenever I revisit Nashville someday?It's too bad about some of their sides being slightly weak(like I mentioned in my 1st review), since if it wasn't for that I'd say 5 stars. Still it's at least 4.75 stars, in my book."
Pretty good chicken sandwich. Biscuit falls apart but so goes the biscuit when its coated in a boatload of sauce. Get it with all the fixins including cheese. Im a sucker for cheese... What can I say?Watch out and be prepared if you try the hot ginger ale... was not expecting it to be hot its written really small on the bottle.Not sure yet if I like leghorn or this place more.Service was great when i went in there. Girl working was sassy classy and real and i like that. She was polite but a couple people said some weird backhanded things to her and it was funny her responses I was secretly laughing.
"Legit solid comfort food. I wish I had stopped by more times! The Nashville hot sandwich is amazing. The chicken inside has a perfect layer of fried coating but the taste of cayenne pepper was extremely strong. It's the perfect spice level for me because it was a) actually spicy b) but not enough to make me lose my appetite. The chicken was also very moist on the inside. Biscuits are crispy on the outside, creamy and smooth on the inside. I enjoyed the mac and cheese too. Bread pudding was average. I really should stop by again to taste their other non-spicy sandwiches next time! To note: When we went, it took a bit of time for them to get our orders out even though there were only 1-2 people in front of us. Make sure you're not in a hurry to go as the food is worth waiting for."
"I reviewed Roost after a recent visit when (despite calling in advance to make sure it could be done) they sent me an order full of the devil's chicken - not spicy, mind you, but filled with sad, dry, breast meat pieces. (Mind you, I mean compared to delicious godly dark meat - some people like breast meat.)HOWEVER!  After receiving my feedback, the owner of Roost reached out via Yelp to make things right.  That kind of customer service speaks volumes, so I am happy to return the stars I had knocked off for the previous experience.That all said, I definitely recommend Roost.  The chicken is perfectly seasoned, crispy (perhaps a touch less if delivered, but that's the nature of the beast) and even the herb-seasoned has a tiny, delightful kick.  The mac and cheese is rich and decadent and gooey, the biscuits are melting with buttery goodness, and the chicken (ESPECIALLY if you get dark meat) is tender and juicy. What more can I ask for?  Oh!  Mashed potatoes and gravy.  But, the sad lack of taters and graves still won't keep me from coming back to Roost and recommending them again."
"I have a soft spot for places that specialize.  This place is a perfect example of how restaurant don't need to have a huge menu to  be great.  I happened upon this place while walking to pick up take from another restaurant. I saw the size of the biscuit through the window and immediately made a detour to get a taste.  It was a bit pricey $2.11, but it is was everything I want in a biscuit.  Buttery, moist while still fluffy, and with a crispy exterior,  Probably not something you should eat everyday, but Lord, I wish I could.  I saw they did breakfast, so I ordered take out the very next day. I had the Brittany (Biscuit with boneless spicy fried chicken, fried egg and cheddar) and it was perfect.  The chicken was juicy with a little kick and the egg was perfectly cooked.  I will be stopping in every time I am in the neighborhood and highly recommend others do the same."
"It was a long bike ride for me to get here but I knew I wanted to try this place for a while.  Who doesn't love a good chicken sandwich?  The Nashville Hot wasn't as hot as I thought it would be and it delivered on flavor.  The buttery biscuit provides an excelent counterpoint to the heat.  I opted for the Mac and Cheese and Potato Chips as my sides.  Both were pretty tasty, but the Mac and Cheese left a little to be desired.  As the mac and chesse is served, there is no balance in texture to it.  It's very goey and creamy but needs like a bit of a crust or something to make everything right.I ordered my drink a little too qucikly as I saw that they had homemade sweet tea and lemonade and a half and half would have have hit the spot. Though I couldn't be to dismayed by my choice of a root beer. All the classic bottles for sodas really plays well into that old school vibe."
"Ordered their Nashville Hot chicken biscuit sandwich ($6, $9 as a meal with 2 sides), Spicy chicken biscuit sandwich, sides of mac & cheese and chips. Sides were avg, so pass. Biscuit was rich and buttery. Chicken had decent heat, piping hot from being freshly fried. Delicious components, although a bit difficult to hold & eat as a sandwich. 4 stars for now, bf rated it a 3. I'm looking forward to trying their bone-in chicken next."
"Growing up eating Southern Food/ Soul food my entire life I was excited to try The roost Carolina kitchen. Unfortunately it was just okay. The wait was ridiculous for the quality of food. I got the bone out with the biscuit and peach cobbler , and the macaroni and cheese. Both of my sides were dreadful! The  macaroni and cheese taste like it came from Kraft, and the peach cobbler was slimly. I had takeout. When I came home my biscuit was drenched with the hot sauce and broke apart. They were rushing so they did not properly package my food for takeout.!I have a high standard for southern food and I was unimpressed."
"Pro-tip: do not bring up Chik-fil-a, perhaps not even in jest, especially not if the man who is going to provide you with delicious hot spicy greasy chicken cannot tell you are being sarcastic.We were warned that there would be a wait as the chicken is cooked fresh and man, it was worth the wait. Crackly red skin and super juicy meat. The mac and cheese was very good, albeit on the small side and the biscuit was the right buttery canvas for the chicken. We also got the peach cobbler and bread pudding, both very well done. I'll be back to get more stamps on my frequent frier (their pun, not mine) card!"
"Ever since we came back from Nashville, we've been trying to replicate the food we've had there. Especially, the juicy, spicy, crispy, delicious chicken we've had at Hattie B's. We had sworn to never have fried chicken again if it wasn't from Hattie B's. But after reading the reviews for this place we felt that maybe, just maybe we have found a replica of the chicken we've had in Nashville (and b/c they have named one of their flavors Nashville hot). Sad to say we were a bit disappointed. The chicken was not Nashville hot nor it was anything like the chicken we've had in Nashville. However, I don't think that's fair to this place, we did come here expecting way too much and we shouldn't have. The chicken here was good, it was way better than poppyes and KFC, so if you're looking for fresh fried chicken, definitely try this place out.  It was tender, moist, and juicy, not quite as spicy or crispy as I would have liked. The oil that they use definitely needs to be changed more often because we can taste the stale oil. Considering this place has a long wait to order in and a place is extremely small and very busy, I am sure that's completely affordable. The sides that I tried were mac and cheese and cole slaw, cole slaw was not bad, however, mac and cheese tasted like kraft dinner and not homemade! Prices are not bad and the staff is friendly. Place itself is a small, cute place where while you're waiting, you have choice of playing chess (neat idea)! All in all, this place was good if you're looking for good fried chicken but don't come expecting a lot."
"This place is delicious!!!! Fried chicken with a flair. It's pricey, but worth it. We bought the following: 1. Half bird Nashville spicy - yummy2. Half bird herb - smelled so good in the car3. Mac n cheese - nothing special. More oily than buttery. 4. Peach cobbler - yum, but for the price, they should have used fresh peaches5. Biscuit - best biscuit ever 6. Cucumber cole slaw - I don't like cole slaw, but this was refreshing Be sure to ask for their frequent fryer card here. Buy 8 meals and the 9th is free I think. We got two stamps from this dinner, which fed me, my bf, and 7 year old son.I can't wait to come back! Thank you to my coworker who told me about this place. I had no idea."
"I was expecting much better. Heard about this place online through the Chicago DNA website and decided to stop by. I took my family of 4 and spent just under 60.00.  The people were friendly and nice but the chicken left me disappointed.The chicken was salty and a bit too much breading overpowered the chicken. I ordered the medium hot and could not finish my four pieces. It was good at first bite but after a few more the breading and salt became overwhelming. The chips were good but also on the salty side. I ordered the peach cobbler by recommendation from the host and that was super delicious I have to say, My favorite item from their menu.My son ordered the spicy sandwich, bread pudding and Mac and cheese. He did not care for the biscuit sandwich due to the breading and salt and he eats anything usually. Everything else he liked. I tasted and agreed.My wife and daughter liked the biscuit by itself with honey.Overall,, the price was high and I was expecting better.  I was initially convinced to try based on the southern chicken and did not like the chicken that much.  There were many positive reviews out there, so I was disappointed to say the least with my experience.I may come back for peach cobbler though..."
"I have been hearing about this place  for awhile and I was really  excited  that I had a chance to try it.  But I was deeply disappointed when I got my meal.  I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit, mac & cheese and cucumber coleslaw.  The biscuit was pretty good, and yes, the chicken was spicy, but it was dry, dry, dry.  The mac and cheese was just like Kraft's (which is pretty scary).  I did enjoy the coleslaw though.  The service was pleasant, but SLOW.  There's only chicken on the menu, so I didn't get what took so long.... especially when it came out dry."
Love this place! They have the best biscuits and the Mac and cheese is to die for. Great everyday food and even better hangover food. I highly recommend the sandwich meal.  It's excellent and you get plenty of food.  You certainly don't leave this place hungry.
"You shouldn't be reading this. You should have already left. You should already be in line. You should already have ordered. One of my favorite places to take people visiting from out of town. Somehow they always cook the chicken perfectly every time. Every. Time. If you're STILL reading this, you don't deserve this sandwich. Go somewhere else."
"The Roost sets the standard for southern-style chicken sandwiches in Chicagoland.Granted, I'd just run 6+ miles, and Divvyed through the rain to get here... so I was pretty hungry and thirsty. Still, when I took a sip of the sweet tea, I knew I was hooked. A lot of sugar and top quality tea make for a wonderful combination. Not a trace of granulated sugar in the cup, either, which is somewhat miraculous for how sweet this tea was.I also ordered a Stevie, the chicken, egg, bacon and cheddar special. How is this place not 100% full at 10:00 on a Saturday?The fried egg was perfectly runny and the bacon thick, and the slice of cheddar perfectly melted. This is all true, but the biscuit and chicken separately were exemplary.I haven't had a chicken sandwich with moist, tender chicken like this. The breading provided more than a hint, but not too much, in the way of cayenne (among other spices). It was also crunchy, which is good, because the biscuit is quite soft, actually. And had a strong buttermilk flavor.The sandwich as a whole is probably 4-5"" tall, so you get your money's worth. And from what I can tell, several people ordered ahead for pickup.Fortunately you don't have to run a 10k to earn these sandwiches... just make a quick trek up to Wrigleyville."
"There's a new food Nazi in town...Came in on a lazy Saturday at 3:30PM and wanted 2 Nashville Hot Chick meals. They said it will take 1 hour, is that okay? Coming all the way from Long Grove, I gave in and said ok. Then I said can ya make that 4 meals? The 4 dudes in the back jaws just dropped. So cashier asks tough lady cooking the chicken if that was possible. They whisp whisp whisp and the verdict back to me was you'll have to wait till 5:30! I said no way!!As I'm waiting for my 2 meals, I noticed other couples were there before me. Sad, they had that whupped look, sitting at the communal bench quietly waiting. 15 minutes later, they get called. That means they must have been there 25 or even 30 minutes for their 2 chicken sandwiches!   My observations says these are the causes for the bottleneck -1) Only 3 fryers used for cooking chicken to order.2) More orders going out for delivery than serving dine in customers first.3) 4 staff packed like sardines working in the small open kitchen.4) Wasting time folding clunky cake boxes for chicken orders at cash register.5) Was not cooking chicken ahead of time to anticipate walk-ins.I guess Roost's chicken was good but so is Brown's Chicken at half the cost and a fraction of the wait time.C'mon people, its just .69 cents a pound chicken, soaking in buttermilk salt & peppa, rolled in flour and cornstarch, then dropped in hot oil for 20 minutes. Try it at home and amaze yourself!"
"Chicken was great. Service not so much.My friend and I came in to try the great chicken. We showed up and no one was there. We ordered. A hoard of of people came in after. And every single one of them received their food before us. When we asked about our food, well over 30 minutes after we ordered and everyone else had received their food, all they said was it would be coming soon. No explanation or apologies. To top it off, the macaroni was completely burnt when I did get my food.Shame the service was so bad. Will never go back when visiting or recommend to others.EDIT:I have updated my score [from 1 to 3] as a reflection of the owner's concern with customer's happiness. Though I do not think what happened is okay, the owner did reach out to me personally about the experience. Any place that has an owner so concerned with negative review when he has so many above and beyond positive reviews. I have the utmost faith that such an owner will work to rectify the problem for future customers."
"Hands down one of the best chicken spots in Chicago. They don't call it the best damn Chicken in Chicago for nothing. If you haven't been here, I highly recommend. Great food great service. Good spot to go when you're on the run. I've been there about 5 times now for lunch and it keeps getting better and better. I highly recommend the buttery biscuits and mac and cheese in addition to the chicken of course!Cheers!"
"The Roost Carolina Kitchen's fried chicken is remarkably juicy and flavorful.  It earns its reputation as one of the best chicken spots in Chicago, and the food is certainly worth a visit to this small neighborhood restaurant.  Along with its reasonable prices and good service, RCK should be one of the first places you think about when you've got a craving for fried chicken.We ordered two chicken biscuit sandwiches, one Spicy and a spicier Nashville Hot.  Both were bursting with flavor and so juicy.  You could choose to get those on a Kaiser roll, but why pass up on those wonderful biscuits?  Don't expect something coming from a mix; these are some serious biscuits made from scratch.  They've got a nice crispiness but are also so delicate in the middle - a great combination.  We added the mac and cheese and peach cobbler as the sides to our combos.  The mac and cheese is more of a traditional style mac.  In a world where seemingly every mac and cheese offering is mixed with some elevated ingredient, it's nice to have a simple dish that doesn't try to hide its deficiencies with something else.  And do yourself a favor and try that peach cobbler!  It's not overly sweet and tastes so fresh and delicious. Of course, I had to get the traditional bone-in fried chicken.  I got four pieces, two herb-seasoned and two spicy.  You'll enjoy the herb-seasoned if you want something different and you'll enjoy the spicy if you like a more traditional tasting fried chicken.  Either way, you'll be satisfied!"
"A group of friends and I ordered from The Roost for delivery and I was not disappointed. I've had The Roost bookmarked for a while now, and am glad to have finally tried their delicious food. I ordered the Nashville hot chicken sandwich. SO good. I love burning my mouth off with hot sauce and this sandwich had great flavor and just the right amount of heat. I was hesitant to try it on a biscuit because I figured it wouldn't travel so well, and the kaiser roll is sturdier. I'll order extra pickles next time for sure. Now, the sides. The chips are freshly-made and have a great crunch. The mac and cheese....is why I'm subtracting a star to be honest. It wasn't spectacular, but not awful, just ""meh"". I can make better mac and cheese, let's be real. I did try a piece of biscuit from my boyfriend's meal (sharing is caring) and it was SO good. Next time I'll have a side of biscuit for sure."
"Roost is one of my favorite ""every day"" joints in Chicago. I am addicted to their spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit. So much so, I often chase their food truck like a dog chasing cars. I wept when I heard their food truck was in an accident and out of commission for a while. Everything on the menu has been delicious. Biscuits are perfect and remind me of when I lived in southern Virginia and South Carolina. The biscuits will fall apart, making any sandwich made with them messy, but so worth it. Mac & cheese is to die for. I highly recommend the sandwich meal. It is quite a bit of food for the money and will easily fill you up. Cons:- The restaurant is quite small, so be prepared to not be able to find seating. So far, I haven't had an issue, but figured I'd mention it.- Line can get long both at the restaurant and food truck. - If you have a large order, definitely call ahead. This is not a traditional fast food joint.- If you order the last spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit from the food truck and I am behind you in line, I will mug you and take it. Don't worry, I will only take the sandwich. You can keep your other valuables."
I tried this place for the first time and I was highly impressed.  The biscuit was surprisingly not dry as most are when they are the size of The Roost's.  The chicken stayed crispy and the chipotle sauce is good and very spicy.  I'll definitely be going to this place again and referring to friends!
4 stars for chicken....very very good2stars for service....very underwhelming. Fast food staff seems happier to serve than these guys did
"I actually grew up in one of the Carolinas, and have eaten my fair share of fried chicken so I think I have some street cred on this issue.  Briefly, this is a good but not great place.  The chicken is ok and the sides are amazing.  Frankly put, the chicken should be the star of the show, not the sides.  The biscuits, mac and cheese, and cole slaw (that's what I had) were damn fantastic.  However, the chicken was too greasy, and most problematically, the batter/skin slides right off the chicken when you're eating it.  That simply is not how fried chicken should be.  Instead, the battered skin should provide a substantial crunch (without dripping with oil) and shouldn't end up in a pile at the bottom of the basket. I mean, the seasoning tasted pretty good (not really ""traditional"" but it was good), but the dish fell down on the tactile aspect.Oddly, I'm not sure what really makes this a ""Carolina"" place, perhaps other than the defaced picture of Mike Krzyzewski in the bathroom...The service was nice."
"Had the Brittany after a night of drinking. Did not regret it. Perfectly fried egg dusted with salt and pepper, a juicy fried chicken breast, and gobs of melted cheddar gushing out the side. Add some hot sauce and you'll be in heaven. The biscuit was a little crumbly and kinda small for my liking; it didn't hold the sandwich together as well as I would have liked. I added some hot sauce and grape jelly to mine. You should too. Called ahead for pick up and the biscuit was ready and waiting on me. The place is pretty small and I could imagine it getting kinda tight and having long wait times at peak hours. I am also from North Carolina so I'm glad I've found a good southern spot to remind me of my roots. Looking forward to going back to try some of those delicious looking sides."
"Walk in a you're greeted with smiling faces! The chicken is DEE-LICIOUS. The homemade biscuits are to die for! There is a little bit of a wait because all of the chicken is cooked fresh, but they are bumpin' classic oldies so you can jam while you wait. Had a great experience and will definitely come back and tell my family/friends about this place!"
"Southern comfort food at its finest! I had been wanting to try this place for awhile now and decided today was the day. Ordered the spicy chicken on a buttermilk biscuit with pickles and the ranch as toppings. Chose the homemade chips and Mac & cheese as my sides! It was as great as I'd hoped it would be! The other sides looked just as good!Could have just had the sandwich and one side as I couldn't eat it all.Sweet tea was on par! So good.I will be back, for breakfast too!"
"Their fried chicken is delicious whether it is in tacos as chicken strips, in a sandwich, or straight up eating it from a basket. They fry your chicken fresh and hot right after the order goes in (hence the 30 min wait), but it is well worth it. A meal costs about $12. The entree alone is about $6. The chicken: It comes out piping hot. When you take a bite, the flesh is soft, melts off the bone, and steaming while the the skin retains the crunch and kick (if you like to live the spicy life like I do) to compliment. Cucumber coleslaw: very light, made in house, has a tangy, savoury, almost pickled taste to it. Mac n cheese: creamy cheddar cheese on curled noodles prepared in the southern manner. Buttermilk biscuit: It is about 2.5 inches high (beware its truly filling). The inside of the biscuit is light and fluffy with a hinting taste of butter. Delicious. Peach cobbler: The most authentic to southern traditional peach cobbler that you could get in Chicago. The cobbler has a slight crumble, yet moist/soft with a perfect amount of a cinnamon dash with peaches hiding under the cobbler covers. When eating this cobbler, your insides feel warm and welcomed as if your grandmother is embracing you. It truly is a southern comfort food. A return will happen."
The foods great. Don't order through grub hub. It literally take forever to get it!  Literally an hour late through grub hub all three times I've ordered from there. Your better off just calling and picking it up.
Where to begin.....HOLY SHIT THIS PLACE IS AMAZING!!!!  Flav-orgasm is the first word that comes to mind!! I almost cried when it was gone!! GO HERE NOW!!!
"MMMM. Another good decision by me.Got their Nashville Hot and it really hit the spot. I ordered the peach cobbler on the side too, and it was DELICIOUS. Super buttery and sweet. All the calories I burned from the morning work out just crawled back to my waistline. Oh well. I think the secret to eating the sandwich is to put some of the HONEY on the table on your biscuit. The biscuit is so soft like pillows but once you add honey, it just takes it up to another level! I would skip the mac and cheese. It's just too heavy and too creamy. I don't think there was enough salt, but yes, do go for the chicken biscuits. They are oh so good."
"Very good fried chicken. I have ordered delivery a few times, but have yet to visit the location. Biscuits are delicious and huge. Not a fan of the Cucumber Cole Slaw and the Mac and Cheese is just okay. The herb chicken is my fav, although I did enjoy the spicy as well. Get the peach cobbler - it's delicious."
"I've yet to dine-in, but I still think The Roost is on to something.  The chicken is very flavorful, aggressively seasoned (in a good way) and travels fairly well for fried chicken.  I'm a big fan of rosemary & thyme so it works for me.  If you don't care for those herbs, this chicken isn't for you.  The biscuits are so-so, as are the other sides. Moving forward, I'll probably stick to the chicken a la carte.  Check em' out if you're in the area and craving fried chicken."
After leg horn chicken this is the best sandwich place!! Nashville hot! And the bone-in fried chicken nashville aswell!
"Asper K.'s experience (see below) was similar to mine.  I had the Nashville hot chicken with mac and cheese and a biscuit on the side.  The texture of the chicken was good, and it came off the bone easily so kudos for that.  I like spice, and this chicken was spicy but not in an ""oh-that-was tasty"" way.  It was more of a ""my-stomach-wasn't-settled-for-the-rest-of-the-­night"" feeling.In one of the earlier reviews, someone mentioned that the mac and cheese wasn't that good.  I agree, though I did enjoy the biscuit.  Oh, if you spend more than 10 minutes inside this place, you will smell like oil.  Just saying."
We stopped in here because you want to place with southern cooking. We were not disappointed. The fried chicken here is very spicy if you want it that way. The side orders that we tried included cold slaw peach cobbler and macaroni and cheese. I can attest that they were very good.
"LOVED The Roost Carolina Kitchen!!! The place is tiny and is always crowded, but worth the wait. It seems like a table always ends up opening up. I love that the menu isn't too extensive...makes it very easy to order! :) You can get individual items like 1/2 or 1/4 chicken or a sandwich or you can get a meal. I definitely suggest the meal because you get two sides with it. I ended up getting the spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit, it was SO yummy! The chicken is perfectly moist on the inside and crispy on the outside! I love the sandwich toppings as well (cucumber slaw, spicy ranch, and pickles). For my sides, I got the mac-n-cheese and the peach cobbler...and my-oh-my was my tummy in a happy place! :) I didn't try the sweet tea, but wish I did! My husband got the pieces of chicken, a side of slaw, and the bread pudding. I, of course, dabbled in the bread pudding and it was good...minus the raisins, but I just don't like raisins...my husband loved it. This is definitely a place to try. Your meal comes out to about $9 (w/o the drink), but worth it. Enjoy!!!! :)"
"The fried chicken and sides are outstanding. Nashville Hot is very spicy..The Biscuits are amazing. I loved the Peach Cobbler.Not the friendliest people working there, and seating is tough.The price is great, and you get a lot of food.How do you not have butter to put on a biscuit??I think take out is the way to go."
"It might take a minute for your food to come while dining in. But I have to say, it's well worth it. and if you like peach cobbler. This is the place to get it."
very small restaurant. expect to wait at least 20 mins for your chicken to cook. suggest calling in ahead for carry out. chicken sandwich on a biscuit was delicious but fell apart on the first bite. need to try the chicken wings next time
"I was told about this place from a co-worker and my eyes immediately shot up. She claimed this was best fried chicken she's ever had, so I had to give it a try.I initially found out that this place was two blocks from where I used to live for five years. When I walked in, I remembered this location used to be a taco joint, but I quickly forgot about that once I saw the menu. They offer four or six piece meals along with different chicken sandwiches between two pieces of biscuits. I ordered the four piece meal (mild seasoning) with a side of cucumber cole slaw and mac and cheese. The chicken was packed with flavor and the sides were a great complement. The skin of the chicken was crispy, but not too oily, which I loved. I think the greatest complement I can give the chicken is that it tasted almost as for as my mom's fried chicken.The mac and cheese had a lot of seasoning, which added to the flavor, and the cole slaw was light and not too tangy.If I could provide one slight constructive criticism, I would purchase more sturdy plastic forks. When I tried to pull a piece of chicken, my fork would awkwardly bend before the piece of chicken pulled apart.That being said, this is a great place that I hope is around for a long time. I will be recommending it to a lot of people."
"We called up 3 hours before closing to ask when the latest was when we could order for delivery. We ordered before the time they specified, but they wouldn't deliver. Never going here.When we called back all they could say was ""sorry."" They're a bunch of liars."
"In my mind I'm going to Carolina...in reality I'm devouring succulent fried chicken at Roost.  Finally, a place in Chi that reminds me of Chapel Thrill...er...Hill.  From the minute I stepped onto those vintage hardwood floors, I knew I was home.  The Carolina bumper sticker, Cheerwine, the bottlecap opener on the wall, sweet tea, and that heavenly smell of fried chicken permeating every square inch of the joint.  Brownie points for the black and white photos of Chapel Hill landmarks that immediately took me back to my college days: Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen (where we used to get chicken biscuit sandwiches after waiting in line for basketball tickets early Saturday mornings), Breadmen's, Allen & Sons, and Time Out (an institution after a late night of partying).The fried chicken was excellent.  It's cooked to order so it's always hot and fresh.  Trust me it's worth the 10-20 minute wait..it didn't even feel that long really.  The quarter platter was the perfect portion for one.  The bone-in herb seasoned had pieces of rosemary in the batter.  The meat was moist and juicy.  Hubby enjoyed the spicy quarter platter.  We both got Mac & Cheese (although regretted not trying the homemade House Chips).  I liked the flavor and consistency of the coleslaw - not runny at all.  The biscuit was like biting into a buttery cloud that transported me back to the main quad at Carolina.  A similar sensation happened when drinking the sweet tea.I can't wait to come back to satisfy my fried chicken fix...or whenever I'm feeling homesick.  We also can't wait to try their family style ordering for our next party.Unlike other fried chicken joints in the city, there's no pretension, just good ol' fashioned southern fried food served with a smile.  A similar comparison can be said about dook vs. Carolina girls.  Not only am I singing Carolina's praises, I'm singing Roost's!  Go Heels!"
"We are two southern transplants, living in Chicago and constantly on the search for good fried chicken.Well, the soul food gods have finally answered our prayers!Forget Leghorn. Forget Honey Butter (no, REALLY forget them). Forget Parson's. The Roost has the best fried chicken we have ever, ever had. It's inexpensive, the wait is never too long, the staff is SO friendly, the ordering in not complicated, the chicken is fried to order, and the peach cobbler will make you cry sweet, southern tears.Did I mention that they serve sweet tea?Just go. Get the spicy fried chicken. Get the biscuits. Get the mac and cheese. Get the boneless on a biscuit with chipotle mayo, pickles, and cheese.Just get SOMETHING."
"We tried this place right after getting a bum tire fixed down the block. I'm not typically a fan of regular fried chicken, but this place seriously impressed me.The run down:I had the spicy chicken sandwich with chips and peach cobbler. The buttermilk biscuit was excellent, but a little crumbly for  a sandwich. Definitely worth dealing with the crumbs though, trust me! Fantastic house made chips, which I'm really into trying at different places right now. Peach cobbler was delicious too.My husband had the two piece herb friend chicken. Amazing! The herbs were really fresh and managed to punch through the breading. Also tried the mac and cheese and coleslaw. Both solid!The place is a bit chilly in the winter, so make sure to either take it to-go or bundle up! Cute decor and nice employees. It's probably a good thing that The Roost is 5 miles from my place ;)"
"The spicy chicken sandwich on a homemade buttermilk biscuit with pickles and chipotle ranch is unreal. Hillbilly tacos and side choices (homemade chips, cucumber coleslaw and mac 'n cheese!) are exceptional as well. Go for the food, not a dining experience. Although playing checkers while you wait is not a bad way to pass the time."
Omg this place makes me LOVE FRIED CHICKEN. Tender juicy meat with delicious seasoning (my favorites are Nashville hot and jalapeño BBQ). Can't go wrong with the bone in half chicken (4pieces) or bone out chicken on a buttery flaky biscuit. Omg THE BISCUIT IS A MUST. Mac n cheese is good when it's hot but the last two times it has come out cold so minus 0.5 star there. Bread pudding is a delicious way to end the meal. Will return- if I lived down the street I would be very fat indeed. Overall 4.5 stars and wayyy better (and more bang for your buck) than honey butter chicken!!!
"I've tried the fried chicken from The Roost's food truck, so trying it from the brick-and-mortar location is a no-brainer.This is the site of the former City Farms, and before that, Rockin' Taco. Beware The Roost! This seems like a doomed spot.Chicken is available ""bone in"" or ""bone out,"" and in three varieties: herb seasoned, spicy, or Nashville hot. There's also a small selection of sides to accompany your meal. I think the choices of side options could be improved. The only potato side they offer is hand-cut potato chips, and while they were very good, it'd be nice to see some mashed potatoes or fries on the menu. There's also a slaw option (made with cucumber), a buttermilk biscuit, as well as mac & cheese. And that's it for savory items. They do have two sweet sides: baked apples and peach cobbler. How about offering only one dessert and adding more traditional sides?I ended up with the herb seasoned chicken on the bone. I thought it was crunchy, and had a ton of flavor. I tend to salt everything, but this chicken didn't need it. Some may even find it too salty. I'm fairly certain the chicken was skinless, which pretty much goes against everything I stand for. Skin is the best part, yo!  Peach cobbler was good, though it had a disproportionate amount of biscuit topping in relation to the peaches.I'd recommend calling ahead if you're doing carry out. There's only two people working and it's cooked to order, so it may take some time.Overall, it's an acceptable addition to the ever-expanding fried-chicken wars in Chicago. Oh, and it's BYOB."
"Now THIS is some delicious fried chicken! On my first visit I went for the Nashville Hot and this was just a bit too spicy for me - I like heat but this had my lips tingling and my tastebuds fried (no pun intended). On my next visit I tried just the plain Spicy and it was perfect! Their biscuits and buttery and delicious and when you stick their giant fried chicken breast in between with their chipotle sauce and a few pickles...heaven! I wasn't a huge fan of their cucumber coleslaw or their mac 'n cheese so the hand-cut potato chips, a biscuit, or the peach cobbler or baked apples are my go-to sides. Fried chicken has become the new fad food here in Chicago and The Roost might just be my favorite!"
"You have to love a place that puts ""bread pudding"" down as a side dish!The Roost did not disappoint.  Met my gal JW here for lunch mid week. (I love it when my friends work from home!). We were the first ones there at 1130 but it quickly filled up and there were many phone orders coming in.  There's seating for about 25 people maybe? Benches and communal tables so there might be some bumping elbows. I went hot with the Nashville Hot with pickles on a biscuit, with a side of cucumber slaw and bread pudding. It was a pretty nice sized lunch and I left pretty full. Food is made to order so expect a short wait. I am also a sucker for soft drinks that don't have Big name brand labels so I chose to wash it all down with Cheerwine, a cherry soda from the South. The biscuit was buttery and soft, the chicken was crispy and juicy. This with the pickles made for a delicious meal. It was spicyhot, but not overly so where I broke out into a sweat or anything. The bread pudding was delicious.  Truth be told, I am a late-comer to the wonderful world of bread pudding.  To me, it has to be great for me to even think about ordering it again because bread pudding can easily go wrong. This my friends, was amazing bread pudding. I loved every bite. After a meal, it was more than enough to share with my lunch companion. Friendly service. Future visits for sure."
"Some of the best fried chicken I've ever had, and I don't even like fried chicken! Meat was seasoned perfectly and was very moist, for both dark and white meat. I had the hillbilly tacos - very good and pretty unique with a slightly spicy kick. Mac and cheese was solid, but not the best I've had. Bread pudding was also good, but not the best I've had the biscuits were huge and amazing though. Sweet tea was also very good! There's limited seating, so probably not the best for large groups."
"I stopped in yesterday with my wife before a Cubs game, and what a great place, a homerun. First, no wait at 11:30 and room to sit. (nothing like that other famous chicken place in Chicago that uses a lot of butter and honey)We each had the chicken sandwiches on biscuits, one a Nashville hot and the other their ""spicy"" both with the works. Their works is a boneless breast with coleslaw and a chipotle mayo. The chicken is seasoned, the spicy isnt really spicy at all. The Nashville hot is dipped or painted with what tasted like a spicy chilli seasoning. This did have a little kick to it, both sandwiches delicious. They dont serve any alcohol, but they do allow BYOB for those inclined. And they do have various sodas and teas.I definitely enjoyed it more than Honey Butter Chicken. Less expensive,less crowded but overall, just better. Get in and try it as soon as you can, maybe before the next Cub game."
Best fried chicken and biscuits I've ever had!!  The restaurant was cozy and friendly.  The food was delicious and came out hot and fresh.  I will definitely be back!
"There's something to be said for doing one thing really, really well, and at this place it's fried chicken. You'll find that fried chicken served up here in a small variety of dishes including straight up with the bone in, bone out sandwiched between biscuit halves, and in hillbilly tacos layered with cabbage and chipotle sauce. Chicken is available three ways (varying degrees of spice) including herb, spicy and ""Nashville hot"". Anyone who has spent any time in the the South knows their version of fried chicken is a whole other thing. And man, when you find it, it's a beautiful thing. This little hole-in-the wall with maybe four or five tables is absolutely bringing the genuine article. It's like being in the South. The chicken is crispy and delicious on the outside and juicy on the inside. The biscuits are the best I've ever had anywhere, large, crisp on the edges but powdery and fluffy in the middle. The sides are equally delicious. The peach cobbler had a wonderful caramelized cinnamon crust on it. The mac and cheese was gooey and cheesy, just the way it should be. The slaw as straight up faithful to the Carolina recipe with tart hints of vinegar and abundant celery seeds. The spicy chicken sandwich with biscuit was just wonderful. The hillbilly tacos were my favorite because you could easily get a bit of everything in one bite.The food here is off the hook excellent at a really agreeable price point. I wish I had a place like this near where I live, I'd be in there a few times a week! BRAVO! I will be back when I get to Chicago."
Ordered the spicy chicken biscuit with the chips and mac. All were pretty good with the chicken and biscuit combo being the best. I plan on driving the 15 miles to have it again very soon.
Roost has one of the BEST chicken sandwiches that I have ever tasted!
"The fried chicken tacos... OMG. I finally stopped in one night on mew ay home and now I wish I'd gone in sooner.  I had their taco special with the regular chicken breading. So, fricking good. Perfectly crispy and magically delicious. The mix of flavors in the tacos was exceptional. Tacos are breaded and fried to order. Hell yes it's worth the wait!I also loved their mac & cheese.In fact, now that I'm talking about their food I've gotten myself hungry for it... guess I'll be heading there for carry-out dinner tonight!"
Had the chicken biscuit medium peach cobbler and Cole slaw. Cole slaw was good. Everything else was great. They definitely know what they're doing with chicken!!!
"Oh my was this place GOOOOOOOD!Quite possibly the best fried chicken I've ever experienced! We went in for lunch last Saturday and boy are we glad we did. It takes a while to get the food because the chicken is fried fresh, and it is DEFINITELY worth the wait! I went with the spicy chicken and it was perfection. It is dangerous I live so close because I may become a regular! I wasn't tooooo impressed with the side of macaroni and cheese, but the peach cobbler was excellent. My friend got the Nashville Hot chicken, and thought it was so spicy that he couldn't enjoy the chicken due to his eyes watering and nose running, so he will be going a step down next time (he may just be a wimp). Definitely 5 stars in my opinion and we will definitely be back for more."
"Everything is made fresh to order, and although their menu is limited to fried chicken, this is what you go there for, and it is the best I have ever had, anywhere.  There are choices from hot to spiced, I had the spiced chicken and loved it.You get a couple of sides with the two piece dinner, and I had a cucumber slaw that had a nice kick to it, and homemade chips that were just perfect. There were some other choices like a biscuit or Mac and Cheese. A couple others,  I will be back to try them all.The owner was there, and was a terrific host, asked how everything was, we talked chicken and some of the other new hot spots with a similar menu in town that have opened recently. What I like about The Roost, besides the great food is the atmosphere. He is playing blues music at a normal level, and it just gave me a down home feeling being there as I enjoyed my meal.The Roost just opened, I was here for day 3- this is an extension of their food truck that still roams around the city, now located just blocks away from what was Cooley High (1975 movie), you may know it better as Lake View High School.  Can't wait to go back. Another big plus, is there is free street parking!  (not metered)"
"The food is definitely worthy of four stars. The chicken is so juicy and tasteful. The flavor of the spices is spot on. I don't believe the pickles are ""homemade"" brined. They tastes like and look an awful like ones I could buy in a store. I could be wrong? I do have some issues with the logistics, like it's absolutely impossible to pick up and eat the Nashville hot on a biscuit. Nashville hot is ""wet"" spice and while the biscuit is simply doing its job being a biscuit, it doesn't hold up well enough to contain the massive piece of chicken. Insert sad face. I really wanted to eat it like a sandwich, that's when it's at its best, when all the flavors get into each bite! Instead, I was stuck trying to eat it with a janky plastic fork and knife. Oh, and it's served in a basket, so that made it even more challenging. I felt like I was chasing the sandwich around a fishbowl. It was frustrating. Next time I might just order the chicken and a biscuit as one of the sides.I can live with the big ol' sandwich and the delicious flaky biscuit, but please for the love of the food gods provide real silverware and a flat surface to break that sucker down! The joint is cute. The guy is super nice and helpful. He'll recommend things and toppings. I like that. The homemade chips were ok. The coleslaw needs something. I want to go back and try the spicy chicken (dry spice). The biscuits are super good and they provide some honey at the tables. All in all, the food is good. The prices are reasonable. And I think it's better than Leghorn, but still a notch below Endgrain's exquisite chicken sandwich (that's a food experience!)!"
The Roost is a must-try! Their chicken is flavorful and moist and their biscuits are fluffy with just the right amount of crispness. Sides are excellent...Mac n cheese is perfectly cheesy without being too rich. Love this place!
OMG! This takes me back from my life in Kentucky.I think I just died and went to chicken heaven.I recommend the herb spiced chicken with 2 sides: biscuit and peach cobbler.Top it off with a Sweet Tea... I'm salivating as I type this review :)
"If you like fried chicken, this is where you get it! Don't be fooled, the Nashville hot...IS HOT. It makes the spicy seem like baby food. Honestly though fantastic fresh chicken, right out of the frier. Best biscuits I've ever had and the peach cobbler melts in your mouth. They deliver too! About to try the sandwich, can't wait!"
"This is now my third food truck I have tried since working in the loop. I was excited to try them because fried chicken sandwiches are one of my ALL TIME favorite foods. There's a lot of elements that go into making a great one. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich on a kaiser roll. I don't like biscuits because they tend to fall apart and take attention away from the chicken. For my topping I chose pickles (A MUST) and the chipotle ranch. I wish it would have been chipotle mayo because I'm not a huge fan of ranch on sandwiches but it was still good. The pickles were awesome, again, a very important element in a good chicken sandwich. Now about the chicken, I gotta say, it is pretty high up there. My second favorite is Leghorn and I would say they are at a tie for the best chicken. Juicy tender meat, crunchy breading, good hold on the breading, just the right amount of spice and seasoning. Along with my sandwich, I chose the cucumber coleslaw and the potato chips. In their restaurant it looks like they have mac and cheese. I wish the truck would have had that. They were out of peach cobbler too which was a bummer. Honestly, the sides didn't do much for me. The coleslaw was super fennel-y and runny. The chips were good but not the best. But, I can definitely say the sandwich, which was the star from the start, was worth a visit! Yum!"
"First and foremost this place is BYOB!!!  Yelp says they have beer and wine but they do not.  I emailed Yelp administrators so hopefully they change the info soon.On to the food ...I'm going to call this the best fried chicken I have ever had.  It was fantastic.  I went with the herb and spices and it was moist and tasty.  The best part is they bread it and fry it right in front of you so you know it's super fresh.All sides we had were great, with the stand out being the bread pudding.  By far the best dessert.351/365"
"After thoroughly enjoying a couple visits to Hattie B's while vacationing in Nashville I was craving a hot chicken fix and decided to meander over to The Roost after reading some very favorable reviews. I ordered a Quarter Bird (two pieces for those challenged with math) of the Nashville Hot opting for a buttermilk biscuit and mac & cheese for my sides. At just $9 (pretty much in line with Hattie B's) this was a nice bargain and was a hearty, filling meal. While the chicken was very satisfying, it did not hold a candle in terms of the heat level when compared to the hotter options at Hattie B's (the Damn Hot - where you are almost guaranteed to be crying after a couple of bites or the Shut the Cluck Up level where you better have a roll of toilet paper chilling in your freezer). There was a definite bite to the Roost's version, but I was able to consume it while walking home without a beverage to cool me off and no tears. Despite the heat only being moderate the flavor was outstanding and the sauce had a nice sweetness to balance the spice. The chicken itself was flavorful and juicy but the skin could have a been a bit more crisp.As for the sides my buttermilk biscuit was simply fantastic; moist, chewy but not too dense, flavorful - everything a biscuit should be and among the best I have consumed. I was fortunate to receive my order just as a batch was pulled from the oven, so it was at the peak of freshness. On the other hand my mac & cheese was nothing to write home about; pretty plain and the flavor just did not do much for me, not bad by any means, but compared to the delicious chicken and biscuit a tad disappointing. The Roost does offer some indoor seating; if you are planning on take out I do recommend calling in your order in advance if possible. I did not do this and as the chicken is made-to-order there was a bit of a lengthy wait, but it was definitely worth my time."
"Yep, I'm declaring my fandom today. When you plan on Thursday to have lunch at a certain place on Friday, then you're a fan. I love a good biscuit and they have good biscuits. Nope, it's not grandma's biscuits but they are good. What should you get? Get what I get: spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit with cheddar cheese, side of slaw and chips to go. (Pull up this review so you can order like a pro). I fight the urge to leave it off my Saturday and Sunday lunch list. The struggle is real. Love you Roost."
Peach cobbler was so delicious. The biscuits were perfect. Mac and cheese is a must. The homemade chips were okay. Loved the spicy chicken more than the nashville. I'll totally be back.
"A couple years ago, I tried hot chicken in Nashville for the first time and loved it! And to cut to the chase, the Roost makes Nashville hot chicken expertly. The seasoning rub and frying are spot on. Beware though...this is actually very spicy, and was on the cusp of a spice level that I couldn't handle. However, it burns so good. Dab some honey on top of the chicken, and it is divine. The mac/cheese is a solid side to get, and was quite cheesy and flavorful although not slap your momma amazing. I thought the cucumber cole slaw was just alright. I tend to prefer a creamier and sweeter slaw, especially as a foil to spicy hot chicken. And I don't know what's up with the A/C in here because it was muggy! Couple the mugginess with some hot chicken sweats, and it can make for a sticky, slightly uncomfortable eating situation."
"I'm filled with a mix of nerves and excitement when I see the line stretching out the door. Excitement to see the restaurant doing so well; but nervous now that everyone else knows about it, so I'll have to wait for my chicken! I'm tempted to write a terrible review so maybe I can just have it all to myself...hmm...I'm from Carolina, and this place definitely hits home. The chicken and biscuits could potentially get them in trouble for trafficking an addictive substance across state lines. The peach cobbler and the bread pudding pretty much melt in your mouth. But cherry on top of the whole experience is  that they have CHEERWINE! In glass bottles. Save the cap and put it in the giant jar before you leave. There's a ""frequent fryer"" program...you'll definitely want to take advantage of that. After the 8th meal, you get one free. And that's like a second birthday, folks."
"Really great fried chicken sandwiches! The biscuits here are really what make the sandwich unique. I think the prices here are fair and the quality of the sides likewise fair. Mac and cheese was peppery and creamy, but not bland. The peach cobbler was a huge disappointment considering I had read so much about it (I guess it isn't peach season, to be fair to them).Service was nice but not amazing. I think calling ahead would be of best advice in order to prevent waiting.Nashville hot with the pickle. Get it on a biscuit. Enjoy!"
"I love this place. My only qualm is that it randomly stops delivering on Grubhub (and in general) sometimes. Assuming it's because of the lunch rush of they're too swamped to send people to deliver.Also I wanna try their breakfast sandwiches but even though they have them listed on Grubhub, you can't actually select them. It always says ""this item is not available at this time"". Sigh.But I've had everything. Love the spicy chicken sandwich. The Nashville Hot had me crying but I couldn't stop eating it. Probably looked like a girl who got dumped and was eating her feelings, because was literally sobbing and taking bites at the same time.I'm not into sweets, so i don't know how to judge the Peach Cobbler and Bread Pudding, but thought the Peach Cobbler was great (it was also not very sweet, so the judgement is biased) and the Bread Pudding probably was awesome, but it was just Bread Pudding to me.I don't like the chips. Sometimes they taste burnt.That herb roasted chicken though. If you're not gonna get a sandwich, get the whole roasted chicken. Or in my case, half chicken white meat. I always get half chicken and a spicy sandwich.Love the Mac n cheese. Cole slaw is ok. Biscuit is heavenly.Thanks for delivering, making great chicken, and being on time! Yum"
"Service was awesome we were greeted by a nice young lady that walked us through there small menu.... The food was excellent so good my husband got two biscuit sandwich lol I got the Nashville ""hot"" sandwich and it was finger lickin good if I had the room I would eat another one but the Mac and cheese and peach cobbler filled my little tummy!!!!! I can't wait to come back here and eat again now I have something to look forward to"
"The chicken is delicious....and I have Southern roots, so you know I know good fried chicken! Definitely worth the line and the wait...made hot and fresh!"
This was one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I've had in a long time!  I had Nashville Hot and boy was it; a nice drier heat.  The mac and cheese was ok but not as Southern style as I grew up with.  Ambience was straight to the point and works well with the food.  Thanks for the Checkers to play while waiting!
"Interesting little joint, not a lot of places in Chicago like it.  Chicken Sandwiches are good, peach cobbler is good, the potato chips are good.  Its a bit pricey for what you get, and there are other type of chicken places that have good food, just not like this one.  Check it out, I go there twice a year, but I do think it is a bit over priced."
"Came back today.Order and waiting times were way faster than before. The person taking orders was also very friendly.Spicy chicken sandwich on biscuit was as good if not better than last time! Seriously, this sandwich is unbelievable.Also had the bread pudding for the first time. Phenomenal.This place is a real gem and I'm happy it's in the neighborhood, the ownership has done a great job in bringing awesome Southern style chicken to Chicago."
"Lunch time!I decided to venture out on public transportation to this fine little establishment.When I arrived, there were a few people seated in the simple, but very charming dining room.I saddled up to the counter, and placed my order.  I couldn't help but linger after I had placed my order to watch the 2 man kitchen in action.  I loved knowing how my food was prepared, and to know that it wasn't just pre made and heated up.  Everything was super fresh!I opted for the bone in Spicy - and I was NOT disappointed.  It had a kick to it that I really enjoyed.  There was some heat, and some flavour in whatever it was they use in their batter that they dip the chicken into before deep frying it.You sit down, and they let you know when your order is ready.  Simple.  And when you are done, you bus your own table.  Keep it simple.  You can't go wrong with this model.I also ordered a lemonade - served in a big old mason jar.  That just made me smile. I felt like I was having a back yard dinner with old friends.I liked the modern set up at the cash wrap.  I loved how orderly and neat the kitchen was.Will I go back? You bet.   I am still excited to try one (or two) of their biscuits.  I may even order more than I can eat, just so I can have left overs later.I am rarely impressed by something so simple - but it was damn good.  I would take out of town friends here."
"If you have never been to this place, you are missing out. Go, today!!! For about $9 you can  get a meal. That includes a fried chicken sandwich in the best biscuits I have ever tasted in my life and TWO sides. It is also BYOB. The place is very small, there are only 4 or 5 tables so be ready to wait. It will be worth it."
"Seriously, order from this place and put it in your mouth. Best chicken this far north your gonna get, especially for delivery. Awesome prices! Awesome chicken! can't beat the homemade chips and mac cheese. The buttermilk biscuit sandwich is the only way to go. Do it."
"THE POSITIVES: They sell bottled Cheerwine, Sun Drop, and Fanta sodas; they also offer Sweet Tea (all of which are hard to come by in these parts). The biscuits appear to be made from scratch. The chicken comes in regular, spicy, and Nashville Hot (the latter is legit burn-your-stomach-spicy, I respect the hell outta that). For about $9 you can get a fried chicken sandwich/biscuit with two hefty servings of sides.THE NEGATIVES: What little seating they have is always full and the place is always filthy (tables never seem to be wiped down, chunks of biscuit and chicken all over the floor, crumbs on the seats). Mac and Cheese was underwhelming and served barely lukewarm. The texture of everything was what I would describe as ""mushy"": the biscuit was way too soft (almost cake-like in texture) & fell completely apart while eating, the chicken was juicy but the skin wasn't crispy, and the peach cobbler was complete and total mush (canned peaches with some sort of starchy topping (unrecognizable) that was the consistency of thick glue).CONCLUSION: Texture and temperature issues aside, everything actually tasted pretty good. I should note that I spent half my life in North Carolina so my standards for BBQ and fried chicken are extremely high. Roost isn't the best fried chicken joint you'll ever patron and the environment doesn't make you want to hang around, but it does a damn fine job of satisfying that craving and they score major points for their beverage options."
I can't even tell you how bad I wanted to love this place.Nashville Hot Chicken 3 StarsPeach Cobbler 5 Stars
"I dream about these biscuits. Simply the best I've ever had.The herbed and spicy fried chicken are both incredible. Mac and cheese is delicious. Peach cobbler is awesome. Just ... do yourself a favor and go here ASAP. It's BYOB, so go grab a growler at the local Begyle Brewery taproom (right off the Irving Park brown line) and then take a short walk over here.Eat fried chicken. Drink beer. Be happy."
"Awesome fried chicken, and the biscuit was the best I've ever had. I usually don't like heavy junk food, but I really didn't regret this.Expect to wait half an hour on a Saturday evening though."
been here about 4 times since the summer.  I have only ordered the sandwiches....because they are so good I really don't need to explore.  this is the best fried chicken and biscuit and breakfast sandwich I have had outside of a place in Portland.  It is southern in every way and yes the biscuits can fall apart (good thing) and the mac and cheese is simple and good (not trying to be exotic with a bunch of things in it)......It does hit your stomach.....its supposed to......try this place
"So, this place is money. Both my fiance and I are from North Carolina, and we went to school at Chapel Hill and are new transplants to Chicago. I got a recommendation to come here from a manager (I think?) from another restaurant saying their friend chicken biscuits were amazing.The experience just brought us back to NC, and seeing the photos of iconic restaurants in Chapel Hill was really fun!!So we went today on a Sunday, and did not have to wait for very long. Things I loved:1. SWEET TEA on the menu! Brings back memories. And bottled Cheerwine!2. Their fried chicken is made to order, so it was PIPING HOT. You can't hate on them for waiting esp. when everything is made to order vs. a Bojangles where the chicken is just picked up and fried in bulk. I got the spicy half chicken + the biscuit and mac n'cheese. The chicken was super tender - even the breast, and the fried parts were oh so good. Corn flaky type of crust. I can't believe I ate everything. 3. Biscuit - very buttery and flaky!!Things I felt they could have done a tad better:1. The spicy is not too spicy. We did not try the Nashville hot, but maybe next time! The spicy is not a cajun spicy, i can't put my finger on it.2. The biscuit is good, but falls apart so it's hard to eat it in sandwich!I really like this place. We will come back. Love the fact that there is free parking off the street! hurrah!"
"What a hidden gem! Thank God for yelp....I met a former coworker for lunch, and it seemed like the best fried chicken I ever had. Gotta give it up, it was awesome. I feel like I've been missing out. Keep up the good work, it seems like a small business, which makes it even more better. No need to go to Popeyes down the street, and deal with the ""Louisiana Kitchen"" rebranding.Support the locals! Excellent food."
"This place serves some delicious fried chicken! Perfect seasoning, perfect juiciness, perfect price. I ordered the 2 piece meal that comes with two sides. Definitely choose the peach cobbler as one of the sides! You won't regret it! I skipped out on the hot sauce and ordered the nonspicy chicken, and that was fine with me, still really flavorful!"
"Hot Nashville chicken in Chicago, thank you. After visiting Nashville and loving the hot chicken there, we tried to make it at home, but it wasn't nearly as good. Then I discovered The Roost on Irving Park. The half chicken Nashville style was nicely spicy. For the sides I had the Mac and cheese and the biscuit which were both great, especially the biscuit, I've never had a better one. $13 for the half chicken and the two sides seemed a little steep, but it's much cheaper than driving 7 hours to Nashville!"
"We found this gem on google and loved everything about it! Not much room designated for dine in eating but still yummy nonetheless. We ordered the spicy chicken tenders, half bird, Mac & Cheese, and peach cobbler.... Their biscuits are to dieeeee for lol so good! Will definitely be returning!!!"
I haven't had a chicken biscuit this damn good for quite some time now. I went a good bit out of the way from where I was staying to get here and I do not regret it for a second.
"So glad that we found The Roost Carolina Kitchen. This is the best fried chicken in Chicago, hands down. It's a little on the pricier side, but what well worth it! Playing checkers while the food was prepared made the wait a little easier. I ordered the Nashville Hot and my wife ordered the Spicy chicken. We ordered a biscuit, chips, peach cobbler, and bread pudding. None of the sides disappointed! The entire meal was full of flavors and we were sad when it ended."
"Not a big place to sit and eat at, but I got a good deal for my money, i got the biscuit sandwich, the biscuit was really good, the chicken might have been a little dry but it wasn't bad by any means, the mac and cheese was really good, tho the bread pudding was a bit burnt, then again some people like it that way, granted i was a bit drunk when i was there (and kept drinking once there cuz its BYOB) so my memory may be a bit hazy lol but it was a positive experience overall"
"Deciding to try something new tonight and landed on The Roost! Glad we tried it! We ordered a 2-piece herb-seasoned fried chicken meal (side: biscuit and mac & cheese) and a 1/2 chicken herb-seasoned fried meal (sides: potato chips and peach cobbler). Here's the breakdown:Delivery: Ordered around 5:15pm on a Friday night and had it delivered within an hour. Still piping hot. Food quality was outstanding for delivery - one of the best we've ever received.Food: Just as the description promises, it's Carolina fried chicken! Chicken quality was great! The batter was a bit salty and spicy for our taste. The biscuit was the best part of the meal - SO good!! All the other sides were also fantastic. The only thing that disappointed with the meal with the saltiness/spiciness of the fried breading (my lips were on fire!!). Otherwise all was spot on! Definitely felt like we indulged in some serious comfort food.Value: Cost with delivery and tip came to around $30 - we were both stuffed and satisfied. Prices are very reasonable.Bottom Line: We'd definitely have it again! I'm hoping the batter was just accidentally over-seasoned and it's not normally that salty - going to give it another shot and keep my fingers crossed. Going to try the chicken sandwich next time :)"
"Very credible fried chicken is served right here on the north side of Chicago. I had 4 pieces of the herb seasoned bone-in chicken with sides of a biscuit and coleslaw. At first I thought I ordered too much--but 4 pieces ended up not being too much. The chicken was moist and mighty tasty, the skin a tad less crispy than I would have liked, and the meat a little less cooked than I would have preferred. The herbs in the seasoning went really well with the chicken. The biscuit was terrific and I liked the seasoning in the coleslaw along with the cucumber slices. Service was friendly. The made to order chicken takes about 15-20 minutes. Well worth the wait in this sharp little chicken shack."
"The Closest thing to southern cooking as it gets in Chicago.  We are fellow Alumnus of the owner and I cannot say enough good things about this place.  He puts the South in your Mouth.The Chicken - Exceptionally handmade.The Biscuits - Try not to salivate when you see one.Sweet Tea - Brewed just like the South, Not a powdered BS substitute.BIG fan of this spot and we'll back most likely more than two days in a row."
"God him/herself couldn't make a better chicken sandwich..I got a spicy sandwich on the biscuit and a few hillbilly tacos(yeah I'm fat).Everything is breaded and fried when you order it, no prefab fried chicken."
Good chicken sandwich but terribly disorganized. They decide which order comes up at random and mess up the order. Not worth waiting 45 minutes for.
Was absolutely terrific when it first opened but the quality has really declined. My last 3 experiences in the last couple of months have been very disappointing. I usually get the bone in and the chicken pieces has become tiny with little meat on the bone. Additionally they seem to be using a different chicken supplier and chicken is tough and bland tasting even with all the spice.
Tasty Carolina chicken. The spicy chicken sandwich is delicious. I prefer to have my chicken and coleslaw together then the biscuit on the side with honey. The chips and cole slaw are the perfect sides to the huge sandwich. They have checkers to play while you wait. Make sure to check hours of operation before trying to go here because you don't want to miss out!
"Okay, best chicken sandwich ever. I ordered the Nashville hot on a biscuit with slaw and pickles. I can't speak for the sides, but the sandwich was amazing. The wait was about 20 minutes, but well worth it. Farewell Popeyes, I'll be coming back here next time I have a craving for fried chicken."
"Heaven.  Seriously.  All five stars are based on the chicken alone.  This is what the northside of Chicago has been missing.  You can talk about those other spots all you want, but the conversation ends here.  The chicken was juicy and succulent and then you add an amazing buttermilk biscuit to the mix and it doesn't get any better.  I have no qualms about bringing my friends from the south here.  Having said that, the mac-n-cheese is decidedly ordinary.  Not bad, just nothing to write home about.  The bread pudding is...lacking.  The peach cobbler however is divine.  It is everything it should be even if the portion size is a little small.   The sweet tea is also done right.   Having said that, no one comes here for the sides  It's all about the chicken.  It's small inside and they cook the chicken when you order it so be prepared for a little wait.  I've already been twice in the last few weeks and I'll be back again soon."
"I came here early morning, soon after they opened but that didn't stop them from being prepared. I got the spicy chicken with chipotle ranch on buttermilk biscuit. The chicken was really good and tender on the inside and flavorful and crispy on the outside. I loved the service and atmosphere. I recommend it and not to forget great price."
"I don't know about this ""Carolina-style"" chicken jazz, but I do know my southern Illinois chicken, and I'm on a hunt to find something in Chicago that tastes like my childhood. You have to understand, I grew up going to a restaraunt named ""Chicken's"", where their specialty was, you guessed it, amazing fried chicken. I have yet to find anything that compares to that, but The Roost was pretty good in its own way.I had what I think was the least spicy option (quarter white meat bone-in) with mac&cheese and a biscuit, and a sweet tea because duh. The crust was super crispy, and to my heat-hating palate, it still had a slight spice to it. It was definitely greasy, but the chicken itself was super moist. Mac&cheese was decent, nothing amazing. The biscuit was delicious, super buttery & I slathered that bad boy with the honey that was on the table & saved that for dessert.Yes, you'll leave there smelling like a walking bucket of KFC, so maybe don't go here before a night out. Yes, you might slip on your way to the bathroom b/c the hallway floor is super slippery (is that grease or just bad cleaning products? I have no idea). Yes, your stomach might be mad at you later because of ingesting all that grease. And yes, it's worth it."
"Nope. Sorry not sorry. Ordered the herb chicken with Mac n cheese, biscuit and the cobbler. So freakin disappointing. Chicken was burnt, mac n cheese was cold, biscuit was dry and the cobbler had some jizz like substance on top. Seriously?! I don't know what you people be eating but this is gross and a waste of money. Plus it was freezing in there! If you want some fried chicken go to crisp or honey butter fried chicken, get biscuits at bang bang and mac n cheese at that burger spot on Belmont n California, you know the one known for their burgers and loud music. Anyway I'm done. Get it right people!"
"I wanted to love this place, but not so much. We decided at 4p on a Saturday to trek from Lockport in the SW burbs to drive to the city 40 miles away to have fried chicken because of all the reviews on Yelp. So disappointed. Firstly, our chicken looked nothing like the chicken in the pics. Ours was very dark brown, almost black. I took one bite and it seemed like it was a minute shy of burnt. The spices were reminicent of the Shake and Bake Wednesdays when i was a kid. My husband could not eat the over greasy mac and cheese. In all the years we have been married, I have never seen my husband pooh pooh mac and cheese. The 1/2 and 1/2 ice tea was so sweet I could not finish it. The positives, the cucumber slaw made with poppy seed dressing fresh and delish. The home made chips yummy. Clean interior. Wont be back..........."
Was over the Top!Super tasty and juicySides were good not fantastic but the chicken more than made up for it!The location is small but nice it's in a nice area.It's better than Honey Butter Chicken very similar type place just better chickenThey do offer bone in or out which was nice.I would highly recommend this place
"Have you ever eaten at a place where the food was sooooo delicious, you had to run home and write a review?(Now) I have. Fortunately for me, I live so close to The Roost, I'm sure I burned more calories eating my meal than walking back home. So this how it goes:I'm at home and hungry.. What should I do?Cook? Hell no...Delivery? Too effen long.. (I was that hungry)""Well then, what are my neighboring food options?"" I asked myself.Chinese place across the street? - NopePopeyes? - I don't think soThen I remembered that there are some restaurants east of Ashland on Irving, so I decide to go explore. I pass by roost, see that it's open, but completely empty...Now, I've walked by this place countless of times and have usually always seen it busy. I back up and decide to walk in. Place looks quaint and simple.. The gentleman who take my order is friendly, I tell him it's my first time at The Roost and I continue looking at the menu. I see the Nashville ""Hot' Chicken [Bone out] sandwich and it has me sold. I get the meal with 2 sides, cucumber coleslaw and hand cut potato chips and add in a root beer to drink., paid my 12 dollars and was told that it would be about 10 minutes.Food was brought to my table, I took a picture, (for memory purposes only, I swear)and I dug in. OH. MY. FRIED. CHICKEN. Before I continue.. and yes I know this is a long review.. a disclaimer.Leave your GUILT at the door.. or at home.. Or inside your gym bag. Why did the chicken cross the road?? To get in my damn belly!!This was the best, juiciest, flavor filled fried chicken sandwich on a biscuit. Sure it was slightly oily.. (on a level of 1-10 of oiliness, I'd say 4), but the outside of the chicken had the perfect crunch to match the tender juiciness on the inside. Now the spiciness is hard for me to rate for anyone else's palate. Why? Because in my past life, in a different dimension, I was a dragon and my idea of spicy is volcanic. Regardless, this had some kick that humored my tongue's desire to burn. Although that might mean something completely different for your tongue. The biscuit was pure voodoo magic, soft, flakey and it had flavor! From the few options to put on the sandwich, I only added the pickles which had the right amount of crisp to add texture to the melange (French for mix/mixture) of flavors dancing on my tongue.Kinda poetic, right??  ok, now the sides... Hand cut potato chips: Simple, crunchy, not greasy nor overly salty.Cucumber Coleslaw: Ehh.. ok. It has potential. The flavor was there but it was anticlimactic, and I think it needed to be a bit creamier. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it. Bottom line: My tastebuds will rejoice and my waste line will cry because I will eat here again.You should too."
"Fried chicken cook to order. Choose between herb seasoned (mild), spicy (medium), and nashville hot (hot).  The herb season is very flavorful. Their peach cobbler is one of the best i've tasted!!!!"
"Had this catered at a party and hot damn it was delicious! I love me some good fried chicken. Spicy was the way to go.Biscuits were also some of the best I've had. They tasted like butter - amazing!Mac was just ok for me though many liked it.Go for the chicken, you won't regret it!"
"I LOVED THIS PLACE SO MUCH! Will definitely be back. I stumbled across this place because a friend suggested that we try something from our normal dinner spots (which have started to become pretty vanilla, as of late anyway). Reasonable wait time for the food, considering it is being breaded and cooked fresh right after you order it. I got a crispy, spicy chicken sandwich and just topped it with cheddar cheese. When you order a sandwich, you get two sides--for my order I got the mac n' cheese (which was phenomenal--just the right amount of cheese/creaminess to noodle ratio ha) and peach cobbler (which is always a favorite of mine). Friendly staff and an interesting mix of patrons. HIGHLY recommend if you are in the area!"
Service was a little off (forgot my drink for twenty minutes and somehow marked my friend's order as take out instead of dine in and then forgot it) but I totally give them a pass because the food was INCREDIBLE. I've never had chicken and biscuits that good. Definite new neighborhood spot for me.
"We generally don't eat massive breakfasts, whether at home or on the road.  When we travel, we're usually on the lookout for morning dining options that offer smaller portions than a massive plate breakfast, hopefully of something unique.  The Roost, which serves no meat other than fried chicken, seemed like it'd fit the bill, and it did.  (And between the wife and me, we've got three parents who were North Carolina natives, so the Carolina connection was a draw.)In the AM, the Roost offers a variety of chicken biscuits.  I tried the Ali, which features the Nashville hot chicken, a fried egg, and dill pickles.  The spicy chicken was about as scorching hot as anything you'll eat not (authentically) Mexican or East Asian or Indian--fine by me, but it really is going to be too much capsaicin for some folks--but the flavor of the meat is bold enough (and juicy) to shine through.  Biscuit was excellent and flaky, too.  If you order any of the ""signature"" biscuits, yours is probably going to fall apart in your hands; it's simply too tall a stack of deliciousness to hang together.  Go ahead and grab a knife and fork and a bunch of napkins.Others at the table got the Brittany (merely ""spicy"" chicken, egg, and cheddar) and a plain chicken biscuit.  They were totally satisfied with their selections, too.  The Roost apparently opened this bricks-and-mortar location only a few months back.  It's tiny and spartan, and located in a rather plain block of Irving Park Road. I don't know if the guy behind the counter was the owner.  He wasn't exactly a ray of sunshine on the morning we were there, but he damn sure knows how to cook fried chicken and make biscuits.P.S.  I see that a Nashville native has weighed in on the Roost's Nashville chicken and dealt a two-star review solely because, in her view, the Nashville chicken is a miserable failure.  But it might be helpful of her to instruct WHY the Roost's ""Nashville"" chicken is off-point."
"Well I know what I'll be craving from now on. The Roost served up some crazy good chicken and sides to my friends and I. They got the spicy chicken sandwich, I got the quarter order of herb seasoned chicken. Both were fresh, bursting with flavor, and a good serving size. The sides were great as well. The biscuit is light and fluffy, the peach cobbler was sweet and crispy, and the Mac and cheese was too notch.The prices aren't bad, and the service is a little slow but still easy. Will for sure be back."
"I have no idea how I haven't written a review for The Roost storefront yet. Their food truck is my favorite of the Loop regular trucks, I've been missing it badly since my work moved to a different building in the Loop and now it's quite a bit less convenient to get to the truck parking areas. Fortunately, they've got this store front in case I get an overwhelming urge for their chicken. Which does happen fairly often.So let's get this out of the way: If the only thing on Roost's menu was the Nashville Hot fried chicken, I would give this place 5 stars. This is the closest thing to the legendary Prince's Hot Chicken that I've found outside of Nashville, Tennessee. It's not quite as painful as Prince's, but it's damned close. If you're looking for super hot fried chicken, you need to get to the Roost immediately. I'm salivating like crazy just writing this paragraph. Jeez.The biscuits deserve special mention as well, and the Nashville Hot chicken fillet on a biscuit is easily in the top 10 most delicious things I've ever eaten. Honestly, the sides are inconsistent (the peach cobbler is always a good bet, though) and the drinks are a tad pricey (but they do carry Cheerwine!), and the wait can get long if they're really busy. But these are all nitpicks, really. This is the best fried chicken I've had in the city, and the best I've had overall since the last time I hit Prince's."
"I probably shouldn't give the full 5-stars, but I'm going to get crazy and do it anyways. I say I shouldn't give all 5 because I've only had the baked mac n cheese. That being said, OH MY GOSH is it good. The best. We always carry out a half tray and we end up with at least a few days of left overs. This place is a hidden gem and I highly recommend it.... The mac and cheese at least!"
We went on a Sunday around lunch time and this place was packed! The spicy chicken biscuit was really good! It was juicy and full of flavor. But the mac and cheese was terrible. It tasted like instant Kraft mac and cheese. My suggestion is skip the sides and go straight for the chicken biscuits!
"Decided to have The Roost cater our daughter's first bay party for ~ 30 people.   It was fantastic.   The whole party was raving about how great the food was and I'm excited to dive back in tomorrow on the left overs.We got all 3 types of chicken - Nashville is super spicy but soooo good.  The other two are awesome as well.  We also ordered sandwiches which come on the biscuits, as well as mac and chz.  Everything was perfect - thanks Roost.  We will definitely be recommending to our friends and coming back soon!"
"The best thing going here is the biscuit.  Holy hell, this buttery marvel.  I wish that they would expand their offerings centered around the biscuit.  You could do all kinds of savory things with it, but how about biscuit desserts?  Pair it with fresh jam!  Or honey.  Or whisky caramel ice cream.  You're welcome.Anyway, the chicken is good but it's not the best.  I was disappointed by the blandness of my herb-seasoned quarter.  The chicken is cooked to order, and though I appreciate its freshness, it comes out egregiously hot and unfortunately oily.  So after waiting ten to fifteen minutes to obtain your food, you must then wait another ten to fifteen until it is cool enough to eat.  Thus, takeout is the preferred order method.  Call ahead.For the record, I liked the spicy sandwich better than the bone-in chicken.  It is simple but quite tasty.  The cole slaw is fresh but boring, and the macaroni and cheese similarly blasé.3.5 stars."
"oh gad, this place is horrible.  The roof of my mouth is burnt,  my stomach is churning.  Also, my fingers are burnt.  Anyways, I'm never going back.  On the way home I stopped by the liquor store and bought some daisy cutters to dull the pain.  Ugh.  What an experience.To be fair, I know it's not their fault that I'm too stupid to figure out how to eat super hot fried chicken.  Ok.   But the sides weren't that great either.  A butter flavored muffin and cole slaw with a cucumber and too much mayonnaise.  Sheesh.Between burning my fingers and mouth on the million degree chicken and the mediocre sides, I just wanted it all to end.  The dudes at the counter had a look about them like a couple of guys selling cheap T-shirts for $15 and not believing they're getting away with it.   Like, really, we can sell cheap az chicken for $9 and $13 by deep frying it and calling it Carolina style.  Life is good.I'm sure I'm in the minority with my low regard for this place.  If I were to bet, I'd bet they'll do really well.  But not off me.  That's all."
"Holy mackerel. This place is amazing. I surprised my fried chicken loving husband (and our two year old) with a surprise trip to The Roost today. Boy, were we impressed! Here is a run down:Spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit- Wow. This was mine and it was crumbly, and juicy, and everything fried chicken on a biscuit should be.Hand cut chips- crunchy, salty, yum.Spicy quarter of dark meat- this was my husband's, and he couldn't have been happier. His words, ""excellent. I could've kept eating forever. I might move to Carolina."" Mac and cheese- my husband and our son got this. I was nervous because of other reviews, but it was great! Creamy, pinch of pepper, true southern style!Biscuit- ""MMMM! MO' BIKIT, MAMA!"" -my 2 year old.Bread pudding- okay, so we ordered the peach cobbler (the deciding factor in choosing this restaurant for our surprise dinner, as it's my husband's favorite dessert) but when we got home and opened it, we were surprised to see a square of delicious looking bread pudding. My husband hates raisins, but ate every bite of this, and his only response to the mix up was, ""it's fine, we'll be back soon.""So, yes, we'll be back soon!"
"Friend: ""Man... That was really good, but I'm soooo full."" Me: ""That fried chicken though...""The Roost Carolina Kitchen is this little unassuming joint in west Lakeview. I recently went to Chicago for a family wedding and noticed this was a new spot on Yelp. Naturally, I hopped on the opportunity to try it. And wow... so glad I tried it. Usually new spots don't make strong first impressions and this place did (in terms of food). When you walk in, you notice wooden tables -- almost picnic-like. It's minimally decorated. Personally, it could stand a little more kitsch -- which is strange for me to say since I usually don't like over-decorated or over-thematic places. I'll assume the owner went to Chapel Hill since UNC stickers are present. Given it's cute name, I think it deserves a little more sprucing up. ANYWAY, we're here to read about the food...They offer bone-in fried chicken. They have a variety of spices and flavorings. When I went in with my boyfriend and a couple friends, we ordered several things. I ordered the bone-out spicy chicken sandwich on a buttermilk biscuit. My boyfriend ordered the fried chicken tacos. For sides, I tried some of the mac and cheese and cucumber slaw. My friend ordered the peach cobbler. I also ordered some sweet tea. I think the most impressive bites of the day were the spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit. That buttermilk biscuit was everything a biscuit should be: buttery, carb-y, dreamy. The bottom of the biscuit, when you turn it over, is all butter. YES. Unfortunately, after a few bites the biscuit fell apart... but the flavors and texture was so on point, I didn't mind. A couple of my friends did though. The chicken itself was succulent, spicy (though it could've been a little more spicy for my tastes), and the batter was nicely fried. The chicken tacos were also tasty. The fried chicken tenders were slathered with a house sauce and cucumber coleslaw. The cucumber coleslaw (as a side) was alright... not necessarily a star -- because I believe even vegetable dishes can steal the show! We were all impressed by the mac and cheese. It had proper cheeses involved (no cheap stuff here!), and it had a little heat which was a nice surprise. My friend said she liked the peach cobbler. The sweet tea hit the spot. Since this is a casual place, there is no server approaching you. The guy who took our order was nice, but he also seemed a little aloof. He sat down a few times at his laptop and had his cell phone on which was a bit distracting because his loud text alerts went off multiple times (at least five times). That's especially noticeable when there's no music playing. While I personally believe in casual dining environments, his presence in the dining room fiddling away on his laptop was a little awkward. It felt like a cubicle was next to us and took on this office-like feel because of the lack of music. Silence isn't always golden.Nevertheless, I stand by my solid rating because the food is what ultimately matters... and they provide delicious bites!"
"Visited this place for the first time this previous weekend. Simply....some of the best fried chicken! I got the quarter spicy chicken (white) ...the chicken was so juicy with the right amount of heat. I had it with the hand cut potato chips and peach cobbler...this is where the meal turned heavenly. The potato chips weren't anything special but the peach cobbler. Man oh man the peach cobbler. I advice you to get a double order of the cobbler, it's that delicious. I'm sad I have to go back to my grandmas peach cobbler. Overall, this is a must try spot in Chicago. One warning, there isn't that much space to sit and seat. The seats they do have go fast. If you live close, get carry out. But this is something you must eat right away. Don't hold off any longer coming here. Get to Roost now!! I can only hope they expand and build one in michigan. Not likely but Fingers crossed"
"OMG, yes!!!! Why in the world did you have to move the neighborhood?  I'm on a strict limit to come here no more than once a month. The food is outstanding. It's cook to order fried chicken with solid sides. My wife and I went with the spicy chicken.  It was some of the more flavorful fried chicken I've ever had. It has a unique flavor to it that will draw you back time and time again. I have yet to try their chicken sandwiches, but they make my mouth water thinking about them. Their breakfast also looks killer. It will take me a while to sample things, since I have to limit my visits!"
"If you're in the mood for AMAZING fried chicken, make you're way to The Roost. I've tried most of the new 'trendy' chicken spots in the city, and this is the BEST of them all.The Nashville hot is my go-to sauce for some kick, and the buttery biscuit tops it off for me.Also, their prices are reasonable, unlike some of the overpriced places that have similar offerings. I wont name names here...Go to The Roost NOW."
"Hands down, the best fried chicken I have ever have.  Now that's not really saying much since I have never eaten made to order fried chicken.  But the chicken was hot, moist/juicy on the inside and very cruncy on the outside.  I'd just eat the breading if I could.  Got the half chicken with mac n cheese, and cole slaw.mac n cheese was great, fresh made to order and cooked on the stove top.  I will be coming back."
"I like the idea, and it's nice to find someplace that isn't afraid of heat.  The ""Nashville Hot"" sandwich is covered in a cayenne batter that is delicious, there's red pepper in the macaroni and cheese, etc.  Unfortunately, on the vegetable side the execution needs a lot of help.  The pickles on the sandwich are pitiful -- bland, limp, and small.  And the ""cucumber coleslaw"" turns out to be regular coleslaw with a couple of half-cucumber slices tossed in -- not, as I had been hoping, a delicious vinegar slaw made of shaved cucumbers.  The biscuit didn't survive either, but that's to be expected when you ask it to hold a piece of chicken covered in molten cayenne.It has the potential to be great, but it's only good."
"McDonald's: Au Cheval :: Chick-Fil-A: The RoostA bold statement from someone who grew up thinking a simple Chick-Fil-A chicken biscuit couldn't be topped.  I finally stopped into the Roost this morning for a nice chicken biscuit to start the day.  There were a couple breakfast sandwich options, and I ended up choosing the Brittany...fried chicken, egg, and cheese on a biscuit.  All sandwiches are fresh, and made to order.  The guy grabbed a raw chicken breast, dipped it in the batter, and fried it up fresh.  Meanwhile, he cooked up an egg on the stove, and when the chicken was ready, he threw it all on a delicious homemade biscuit.  Perfection. I'm not a big church goer, but for some reason I was singing bible hymns after I ate the sandwich.  I gotta go back for dinner real soon."
"I'd give this place 4.5 stars (c'mon Yelp - half stars please!) as it closes during the week @ 8PM and weekends @ 9PM - way too early. I've only had the sandwiches and not the 'in-bone' chix selections. For $9 one gets a deliciously moist chicken sandwich fried in a delectably crispy and tasty batter as well as 2 sides. I recommend the buttermilk biscuit as the sandwich bread - it will fall apart in your hands, but it's worth it. For a side, the Mac 'n cheese is a good bet as well as a dessert of either peach cobbler or bread pudding - don't be too judgmental as the two sides only add $3 to the bill.The service staff was incredibly patient, friendly and informative as I notified the two helpful young women that I was a first-time customer."
"OMG!!!!! Literally some of the best fried chicken In Chicago!!!! The place is small...and can get extremely crowded; but the chicken is worth the wait! We order the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle ranch and the 2 piece herb bone In chicken w/ Mac & cheese and fried chips as our sides. The chicken was very flavorful, moist and nice portions were nice. The Mac & cheeses would have been awesome if it was hot and bubbly  but it was warm. Can't wait to visit again!"
"I am a neighbor and have seen lots of pathetic attempts at restaurants try to occupy this space. The last good thing was the NN Smokehouse. I am ecstatic that The Roost has come along. Fresh, great food. The Nashville hot will make you hear colors, a truly transcendental experience. Not the fastest place in the world, if you are in a hurry go to Popeye's."
"It was pretty good, although for the amount of food you get, a little expensive.I got the spicy chicken on a biscuit, with slaw and pickles on the sandwich, and mac and cheese and slaw as the sides.The chicken was great.  It was crispy on the outside, but juicy and tender inside, and had plenty of flavor.  The slaw was just okay.  The pickles were delicious dill pickles with a nice sour flavor and no sweetness.  The biscuit, like the chicken, was flaky on the outside, but not at all dry on the inside.The mac and cheese was delicious, with a ton of black pepper, which added a nice layer of flavors.The slaw was just okay, and I would probably pass on it next time."
Quick Spare Menu/ Very fair prices:Chicken on a biscuit 5/5Mac & Cheese 4/5Peach Cobbler 4/5 starsWill Update after a few more stops! gdd
Been to the Roost a few time and it's always really good.  One of the best fried chickens but the piece size seemed small my last visit. However they have great sides that full you up( the Mac and cheese is the best).
Awesome food and great service. The chicken sandwich was delicious. I tried the peach cobbler and it was just as good. I will definitely be going back
"Yelped this joint while out on a walk and it was the best decision I made while in Chicago. It's small; probably seats about 30 people or less. The owner took my order (I figured he owned the place since his picture was on the wall) and my chicken was pulled out of the brine immediately after the order was placed. It took about 15-20 minutes for my food to come out but it was worth the wait. BEST FRIED CHICKEN EVER. The biscuit was buttery goodness. The mac 'n' cheese wasn't impressive but who cares when you have the best fried chicken ever?I dream about going back and having more but in the meantime, maybe I can start a petition for a location to open up in Seattle."
"If you have a couple more bucks and you want fried chicken, go here instead of Popeye's down the block. Skip the coleslaw, and the mac n cheese is uninspiring, but the chicken is crispy and good on a frigid day."
"Cozy restaurant, maintains the food truck appeal.The chicken sandwich was delicious, flaky, buttery biscuits are fresh. Dessert was pretty vanilla. I hear the Nashville hot has enough of a kick to make your nose start running.I'll be back to try the bone in -- looked so tender and juicy!"
"I would say this is not only my favorite chicken dish but my favorite sandwich in Chicago.Spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit, mac n cheese with a half n half has been amazing every time I've been here. I don't live far but I sure wish I lived closer to this place almost every Sunday when I think about what I want for lunch."
"For nine bucks you can get two pieces of fried chicken and two sides. I got the herb crusted chicken (kind of wish I had gone with the spicy though, since my neighbor's looked so good!). They ask you if you want white, dark, or a mix. I got the dark, which means one leg and one thigh. The fried chicken was very flavorful, though also very oily. Granted this should be expected for fried chicken, but I still be the excess oil could have been minimized a bit.The meal comes with two sides. I got the baked apple (very good) and the macaroni and cheese. The mac and cheese is different than what you might expect as the cheese contains a bit of Tabasco or something similar in it. I've also tried the peach cobbler, which is really delicious - recommend that over the baked apples. Finally, their biscuit is the most buttery I've had. Wish there was some gravy to soak it in though!"
"seriously great chicken. And I don't write reviews. if you eat in, you may have to wait a while, but it's totally worth it. Some of the best peach cobbler, hands down. I love this place."
Came here for an early lunch and love it! By the time we were leaving the place was packed with the lunch rush. Great habanero BBQ fried chicken and the cobbler is so so good. Can't wait to go back for more!
"My friend and I drove from the Loop to get take out from The Roost. This was the 2nd time we went and I was not disappointed. We each got spicy fried chicken and mac and cheese. Both were seasoned perfectly and were delicious! I got the peach cobbler as my second side option and my friend got the biscuit, both were tasty. The biscuit basically melts in your mouth. The pricing is extremely reasonable. Considering you can pay at least $20 for an entree at an upscale restaurant 2 orders of chicken and 4 sides for under $20 is a steal. I rave about this place to everyone so I thought it was my duty to share my enthusiasm on YELP. I will definitely be going back!"
"Chicago , IllinoisVisited the Roost a couple of weeks ago after hearing about their menu item :THE STEVIE. Sooo I travel across the city to the Rooster because I have a taste for something different. Me thinks the Stevie is different. Upon arrival I discover to my absolute horror that the area is devoid of any place to park ! Any restaurant that offers supposedly great food without providing their customers with a place to park automatically loses one star. After searching for a parking place I manage to sequester a parking space. I then walk the two blocks to the Rooster and what do I find ? A line of people waiting ahead of me while their order is being prepared. The nerve. First I drive across the city. Then I search for parking. Then I wait in line. This Stevie sandwich better be worth it because you just lost another star due to the long wait. You are down to only 3 stars now. Finally. I place my order and I'm told that "" the Stevie "" is a breakfast item ONLY and no longer sold after 11:00 am. What ? It is 1:00 pm. What to do ?Sooo, I order a chicken sandwich on a biscuit... And wait 10 minutes or more for the sandwich. My name is called and I have my sandwich in hand but the place is crowded so I opt to take it to go... Drive all the way home... Across the city. Sandwich is wrapped in foil and stays warm until my arrival at home. I'm hungry now... Really hungry ! This better be good ! Wellllll, it was different. It was real SPICY ! It was good.  It was huge ! More than I could eat. But I really wanted THE STEVIE. So I guess that will require a return trip across town and a search for parking again. Yadda yadda yadda. BUT I WANT TO TRY THE STEVIE ! Then I will render a supplement to this review."
"After weeks of waiting, I finally was able to eat here. Im used to seeing people lining up for good food so this didn't fazed me. Unfortunately, the experience was a let down. First the lady taking the orders had me wait twice to answer the phone. Really? Then there was the 55 min wait for our sandwiches. Then after 55 mins they tell me they ran out of buscuits. Did I just told you 55 mins? Really, again? Then they served our sandwiches cold and no toppings that were supposed to the in it. They ran out of bread pudding so I ordered mac and cheese. What they gave me was peach cobbler.  Really people??The whole time no one apologized or explained anything. I had a bite of their chicken and they were good. But no matter how good your product is, bad customer service will sink your business down the drain. Go to leghornchicken.com instead. Their chicken are far more superior and great customer service to boot."
"Thanks for letting us wait in a rather small line, get to the counter ready to order, and watch you repeatedly answer phone orders, not take ours and then tell us you're closing early."
"Heard about this place from a friend who sang its praises. Finding it was a breeze, off street parking readily available. I could smell the essence of The Roost wafting down the sidewalk welcoming me in. So place is small but cozy. Tables arranged for community eating..(I love that by the way) everything very clean, positive atmosphere and the small open kitchen concept was a nice touch. So looking at the menu I couldn't decide what I wanted. Should I try the Nashville hot chicken, the herb roasted or spicy chicken? Try a dinner or have the sandwich? Sweet tea or Arnold Palmer?  Desicions..desicions. Well I decided to order the spicy and herb roasted chicken with coleslaw, mac n cheese, peach cobbler and sweet tea.Friends...that first bite into that fresh, juicy seasoned chicken was pure bliss! Plus all the cracklins at the bottom of the box was a extra treat! Mac n cheese was cool(for you mac n cheese snobs, it was not serious soul food Sunday mac n cheese), peach cobbler was delicious too. But besides the chicken, the coleslaw stole the show! They add slices of cucumbers adding a freshness to coleslaw I've never tasted before. It was good! I wished I had more. Well sadly I wasn't quick enough to snap a pic before I started eating my food so you'll just have to trust me when I say this chicken is good goody good! Get in there and get you some!"
The Roost Carolina kitchen has the greatest tasting Carolina style chicken I've had in a long time. It's just like being back home !!! This restaurant is off the beaten path a very homey and very friendly environment or I should say family friendly environment. The seating is for about maybe 30 people total very cozy and if you have time you can play checkers to. The chicken is cooked to order. They do an unbelievable carry out very busy and if you can you can call your order in ahead and time yourself to hit the restaurant right when your food is ready. So if you're in a hurry or you want fast food fast I would go to one of those fast food restaurants and not bother trying to get some great cooked chicken from here but if you're not in a hurry this is the place to go this is a must stop when you are in Chicago or you should at least add it to your bucket list before you pass away you must go to The Roost Carolina kitchen in Chicago Illinois.
One of the best fried chicken sandwiches on a biscuit I've ever had! Don't waste ur time going to the chain restaurants out there for fried chicken n biscuits. Everything you order is made after you order it so it takes around 15-20 minutes for them to fry their chicken but it's worth the wait! Tried their spicy chicken sandwich and it was sooo good. I also tried their tacos and they were excellent! U can't go wrong w their Mac n cheese and peach cobbler as sides! Come here- you ll love their food!
"Let me start off by saying that this chicken is unique, but its very good! It was so moist and tender when I bit into it. I wasn't expecting that since the outside of the chicken was fried hard. I had a great meal and I will definitely return and recommend to my friends."
"I don't like fried chicken, but when I love them, that means they are good!"
"I loved this place, and I don't even like fried chicken! First off, the Nashville hot is the only way to go - even if you don't like hot foods normally. I tried the ""spicy"" and found it totally bland. The Nashville hot sandwich was great - I highly recommend adding pickles and cheese to break up the mouth-punching (awesome) flavor. Get it on a biscuit. Then get sides of biscuit. You will not be disappointed. Mac and cheese was a welcome way to cool the spicy mouth feel, but it wasn't a standout by itself. But, really, who cares when you have chicken that good on a biscuit that good in front of you?"
"Really excited to taste this place! The fried chicken was very good, but on the glistening side. You must love your chicken skin to like this place! I was a bit disappointed in the  side portions, which were on the small side, but very tasty, which is why I wished they were at least 2-3 bites larger! Over all good take out experience. Loved the bread pudding!"
"After trying almost every Chicago restaurant that gets rave reviews for its biscuits, and being sorely disappointed each time, I began to think that people in Chicago just don't know what a proper biscuit is. When I walked into Roost and saw the Sunrise Biscuit Kitchen and the Allen and Son photographs I knew I was in good hands. For those unaware, Sunrise makes the greatest biscuits in the world (fact) and I both love and hate my friend who introduced me to that little stand.Let's start with the chicken, as others have mentioned, the chicken is fried to order, so expect to wait a little bit for your freshly breaded and fried chicken. I've had both the boneless sandwiches and the bone-in birds in spicy and Nashville hot. I'm a huge fan of spicy foods, so the Nashville hot is right up my alley, for the average person the spicy should provide plenty of kick and you can get the chipotle ranch sauce or slaw to cool things down a bit if you get a sandwich. I haven't tried the herb chicken, so I can't comment, but it seems to be pretty popular.The sides are about average depending on what you get. I always get the potato chips and will try other sides on each visit. A lot of places that do fresh chips cut them too thick and don't cook them through, but the chips here are done right. The slaw is OK and the mac n cheese about average, not great and not bad. The best side is the biscuit. This is how a biscuit should taste. Salty, buttery and flakey, but strong enough to hold up to the fried chicken if you decide on a sandwich. This is a real biscuit.The price is right for the quality of food and the people are always super nice. They have some bottled sodas, self service ice water, iced tea, lemonade and half and hallfs. You can also BYOB.If you like fried chicken and biscuits, go here. If you don't like fried chicken and biscuits, you're missing out on one of life's greatest pleasures."
"Nashville Hot Chicken in Chicago? Woohoo!Seriously, the chicken sandwich is the only thing to get here. The Nashville Hot isn't as blisteringly hot as I would expect, but it does have a bit of warmth to it. And they have slices of real pickle on there, not some limp neon green garbage from a jar.If you think Chick-fil-A is the center of the chicken sandwich universe, these guys will change your mind. Or at least give you pause.Do get it on a bun, not the biscuit. The biscuit is tender and crumbly which is how it should be, but it will not hold up to a sandwich, and you don't want that spice paste on your fingers. (why not add a white bread option? the Kaiser roll is too much)Sides: The cucumber cole slaw is amazing (go easy on the poppy seeds next time though), the mac and cheese is great (sharp and tangy, firm in texture), the chips are awesome (nicely browned and not buried in salt). The peach cobbler was awful in October. Bread pudding was just right.A meandering aside on beverages here: yes, they have Cheerwine. If you don't know what that is - imagine if they took the good stuff out of Robitussin. Wait, there's no good stuff in Robitussin? Congratulations, you have now understood the essence of Cheerwine!Cheerwine is awful. If you grew up in the South, then you like it not because it tastes good, but because you used to drink it. It is cherry-flavored nostalgia and ass in a clear glass bottle.The best way to consume Cheerwine is to mix it with dirt, by pouring it out of the bottle and on to the ground. Haitians refused it in their food aid packages. It is used to discipline wayward children in Virginia. It is the only glass bottle that gives you a paper cut. It steals your quarters on laundry day. Eva Braun used to enjoy it. At bondage clubs, my safeword is ""Cheerwine"".So yes, The Roost has Cheerwine, but you had best avoid it."
"The Roost is great!  One of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have ever had and I recommend having it on a biscuit with cheddar cheese. The best part though is that they extremely consistent, I have gone 5 times in the last month and each time I have been very satisfied. It's cool that they reward loyalty as well by having a punch card! It's not sophisticated and tech savvy but it is a very nice thing to do for the customer and personally I am excited to get s free meal that is literally awesome! I hope this is helpful to everyone"
"Incredible fried chicken sandwich. It's a small storefront so I've always gotten it to go, but they package it in a box with a red checkered paper so it feels like a real picnic. I've gotten both the spicy chicken sandwich and the Nashville hot. Both are recommended! The mac and cheese at times is really good, and at others...meh. But I still recommend it. Tried the bread pudding for the first time this afternoon. Do yourself a favor and get it.I love Honey Butter, but Roost is a real standout in the city."
"This place is a hidden gem. It might be the best chicken sandwich I've ever had ! Get your sandwich on the buiscuit, they are amazing. The place is really small, not very many tables so I wouldn't recommend it for a large group but it's perfect for a casual lunch/dinner with a few friends. Bring your favorite bottle because as if having the best fried chicken in town wasn't enough, they are also BYOB"
"My husband and I went for lunch the other day. The order was taken promptly but it took a long time to get our order. We ordered a chicken sandwich on the biscuit, side of mac and cheese and a 4 piece chicken with biscuit.  It seemed to me that while there was only 1 order ahead of us, they were making grub hub to go orders first. The chicken was moist and good. The biscuit excellent. Mac and cheese good but overcooked noodles for my liking.  I would go back if in the area but wouldn't make a special trip there. it was 29.00 for our 2 meals."
"Hands down, best chicken sandwich I have ever had! Im living in nashville now (the land of plentiful hot chicken) -just moved from Chicago- and have yet to find spicy chicken as juicy fresh and delicious! Whenever visiting Chicago we will definitely be making special trips back to roost for the best spicy chicken sandwich in the world! Make sure to get everything on the sandwich (cucumber slaw and sauce). My husband and I always get the bone-out spicy chicken Sandwich. I'm sure the bone-in is delicious as well..."
"Quite simply, the Nashville Hot on a biscuit is one of the best chicken sandwiches I've ever had in my life. Sweet tea that's not *too* sweet, delicious mac & cheese....all the ingredients for a quality Southern meal are there! The place is small, so be prepared to wait - maybe next time I'll carry out, but there will DEFINITELY be a next time!"
The food here is very good. Mac and cheese is very good cheesy and soft. The chicken is very nicely fried and has a huge variety of sodas; my favorite: Strawberry Fanta!!
chicken is okay...only thing is they got my order wrong!
"Absolutely amazing! Everything I got was fantastic. The biscuits were exactly how you want them to taste and the chicken was perfectly fried. Yes, there was a little bit of a wait, but isn't there one for anything that is worth it? Yes, yes there is."
Just walked out of here a full hour before they close at 3 because we were told they are not taking more orders. There is no line and they did not run out of food. That's cool because we just got a zipcar from Streeterville to come have some chicken and I can see in your prep area that you have plenty of it sitting around waiting to be fried. Explained that to the cashier and no dice.
"Really great food. The Nashville hot is spicy enough where you don't need hot sauce. Mac & cheese was tasty also.  Not a large menu, put they do it right. Will definitely return."
"This was probably the best chicken sandwich I have consumed.  $9 for that and your choice of side (I went with the buttermilk biscuits, which were awesome).  Absolutely enjoyed every bite of the spicy variety, topped off with honey.  These guys know exactly what they are doing, and it is worth the premium and the wait to be here."
"I've had this fried chicken twice because I wanted to like this restaurant, so I gave it a second chance. This is the greasiest fried chicken I've ever had. Not crunchy at all. At. All. The peach cobbler was good, and so was the mac and cheese. Even the biscuits were good. But a southern restaurant should know how to fry chicken better."
"BYOB. I love this place.First time I went, I got just the fried chicken. Second time, I got the sandwich.In either case, I recommend the nashville hot."
Date lunch with my wife and we cant wait to go back great bisket sandwich everything was great.  The peach cobbler was to die for.  I had the half snd half and noticed a wine soft drink but did not not havr it. Next time i will hsve
"Excellent casual place for fried chicken and biscuits!  I had all the fixings (slaw, pickle, chipotle ranch, sharp cheddar cheese).  The sides I chose were the mac and cheese and peach cobbler.  You can chose how hot you want your chicken.  I picked spicy because the guy behind the counter said Nashville is really hot.  It was the perfect amount of spice for me.  The biscuits are to-die for and I really enjoyed my sides.  The place is busy so be prepared to wait.  Highly recommend!  I will be going back."
"My boyfriend and I were in Chicago for a long weekend and I wanted to try a fried chicken joint. Seems to be a bit of a trend in Chicago. Did my research and decided on The Roost. We both ordered 1/4 mixed chicken- herb and spicy- with two sides each to go. When we opened the boxes, we each found a wing and a tiny thigh. That's was it. The chicken was good, but for what we paid, it felt like a rip off and left us wanting more. The slaw was inedible-- the celery seeds overpowered the whole portion. The biscuits were good, but the ones I make are better. Cobbler was edible, but nothing special. Really big disappointment and we won't go back."
"This place was great! I have no idea what type of spices they are using, but they make the chicken taste exceptional. Keep up the good work Roost team!"
"Ahhh Ahhh Ahhh!!! This place is amazing! It got a fried chicken sandwich (no bone) w the slaw and dill pickles... Uhh, to say the least, this was an orgasm in my mouth. The biscuit was moist and not dry at all, the chicken was lean and juicy and perfectly cooked, and even though it was fried it wasn't too greasy. They use an awesome cucumber slaw that is super fresh and light that compliments and completes the sandwich perfectly! Finally, we got the peach cobbler which was warm and fresh and the crust was amazing! The service was also great and they were super friendly. Definitely will go back here again!"
I've only ever had the chicken biscuit here and it's wonderful!  The biscuit is so moist and rich.  The chicken is spicy and delicious.  They make everything to order so the store front always has a little wait.  The food truck is faster but they still put the sandwich together to order so it takes a few minutes.  It's totally worth the wait!
"Tried the spicy chicken on a biscuit, the Nashville hot on a bun, the baked apples, the peach cobbler, the mac-and-cheese and the housemade chips today for lunch.  WOW.  Wishing this was closer to my new apartment, but as is, I'll make the trip every so often.  Everything except the apples was pretty amazing, but for my perfect meal, I'll go back for the Nashville hot on the biscuit, with the mac-and-cheese and the cobbler as my two sides.  Damn, this was good!!"
"The chicken is good and the biscuits are good.  In fact, they are SO good that they win me over, despite some shortcomings.If you're traveling any further than 15 minutes to get here, make sure to time your visit right.  If you get caught in the lunch or dinner rush, you're going to be waiting a long time in a very small space without sufficient seating.I didn't find any of the sides to be special, and the drinks are limited...BUT, the chicken and biscuits are so good that I don't care.Definitely give Roost a try!"
"Incredible food, it's a blessing and a curse I live so close! Basically - you can't go wrong with any options or sides, just give it a try and come with an appetite."
"OH MY GOD THIS WAS THE GREASIEST FRIED CHICKEN EVER!!! We were nauseated by the huge orange pool in our take away boxes. I actually feel my arteries hardening and my heart slowing down. The chicken itself was pretty tasty, but the breading was off putting.. Biscuit was pretty good, bread pudding and peach cobbler were pretty much the same over buttered soggy mess. Really disappointed and we will never go back."
"So glad they opened up a physical location so close to home! I got accustomed to having their food truck come to work one to two times a week but having this place on my way to and from places is dangerous. I certainly plan on filling up a few punch cards now that I can get this chicken anytime I want. There really is no comparison to fried chicken that is made to order. It takes some time to get your food but it is definitely worth it. With that being said,  I would certainly recommend calling ahead to save yourself a 10-15 minute wait. The breading is crispy and fresh and the chicken is amazingly hot and juicy. I'd recommend getting an extra biscuit if you're getting a sandwich, as they can fall apart sometimes. The chipotle ranch is super good as well.  I seriously just had breakfast but this review is making me want The Roost now so I'm gonna stop. Just take my advice and go there, NOW!"
"Stopped by to grab lunch today and could not have been happier with my decision.  I have been wanting to try their chicken since they opened and I will say that this is probably the best chicken sandwich that I've ever had.  I tried the Spicy Chicken on a Kaiser Roll with all of the toppings.  Toppings included cole slaw and a good number of pickles that made the flavor pop.  I loved the spicy chips as well, but thought the mac & cheese was just ok.  If I have one gripe about the place is that almost everything has some type of spice to it.  While I'm ok with this, my partner hates spicy food which is why it took me so long to get there.  I feel with the addition of a couple of mild items they could increase their business even more (even though they seem to be doing pretty well).  I'm sad that my partner can't experience how great this chicken sandwich is all because it only comes spicy and hot.Regardless, its still five stars from me!"
"I had hot chicken at Hattie B's when I was down in Nashville and absolutely loved it. When I read about The Roost, I was excited to go try it out. I LOVED the biscuit and all of the other sides were very good, but I didn't feel like the hot chicken was the same. My wife's mild fried chicken, however, was excellent. I would definitely go back here, I'd just change up my order a bit."
"I got some of the best chicken of my life at The Roost Carolina Chicken today. Tasty, crunchy, spicy, and inside a wonderful biscuit! To be honest, I wanted to give 4.5 instead of 5 stars because the mac n cheese were good, but not as creamy as I expected. The peach cobbler was simply amazing.Will come here pretty often!"
"WOW!  What isn't there to say about this place?!  I had a taste for chicken last week and decided to give it a try without knowing anything about them except they were in walking distance to where I was.  I went to their website, looked at their menu, called and placed and order and that was it.  I was definitely a clean slate.The food is OUTSTANDING.  I tried both of their bone out sandwiches and an order of chicken strips.  The chicken is AMAZING.  The breasts are huge and taste like no other chicken I've had before.  They have a Spicy and Nashville Hot selection of the bone out sandwich.  I LOVED the spicy (got cheese on the sandwich too).  The Nashville Hot was good.  However, I need to throw it out there the Nashville Hot is HOT, very HOT.  For those who are fans of hot, you will probably not want to get it.  I love hot stuff but this one was even too hot for me.  I got both sandwiches on a biscuit and the biscuis were awesome!The chicken strips were great as well.  It was probably the first chicken strip I've had in my life where I didn't need any sauce to go with them, they are that good!I did my due diligence on the sides and got one of each to try.  All were amazing, my favorite being the hand cut potato chips (came out HOT) and the baked mac & cheese.To top things off, I decided to get a fresh squeezed lemonade while I was waiting and it was amazing too!I really have nothing bad to say about this place.  I will definitely be going back and hopefully VERY soon!"
Food was decent but i would not say that it beats Popeye's. Best part was the biscuit with honey. Wait times are terrible so order ahead of time.
Spicy rubbed thighs and breast were easily the best fried chicken I ever had. The biscuits were amazing. I liked honey butter but this place wins the Chicago fried chicken award hands down.
"Man oh MAN (ohmanohmanohman).  So simple.  So well done.  You compare Roost to one of the multitudes of small local restaurants that have menus that literally have 60+ items and you cannot help but wonder wherein the difference lies between choosing such methods... I feel that Roost knows what it knows and it knows it well.  As opposed to restaurants that have a lil bit o' sumthin for everyone; sure, some, nay most, may not be worth your while, but if you have a hankerin for nearly anything it is supplied.  Roost does not abide by this principle.  Instead, Roost abides by the Joker principle: ""If you're good at something, don't do it for free.""Concisely: best biscuit i've had, outside mi madre's home-cooked.  Best fried chicken sam I've had, with Meatheads (I know, right...) in second.  Be forewarned, the spicy option-The Nashville Hot, has SOME TANG.  I couldn't believe.  My Mexican pretentiousness for all things labeled ""spicy"" was thoroughly quashed. Cole slaw 3.5/5  Nashville Hot Bone-out Sandwich on Biscuits peppered liberally with hillbilly platitudes: 5/5Half & Half tea: 2.5/5... because it SHOULDN'T COST ME 2 DOLLARS FOR A SMALL MASON JAR OF ARNOLD PALMER, COME THE FUCK ON.It's odd, if you think about it, but if Roost sold literally only chicken, it'd be a 5/5 from me, but since the other things they sell, though very delish, are thoroughly out-classed by the chicken you end up with 4/5.  Take that as you will.  p.s. the place is small, there is meterless parking out front on Irving Park (as of 5/19/14.cheeers!!!"
You've gotta try this place! You will not be dissapointed! Blows Leghorn Chicken out of the water.
"This Nashville girl is not impressed with their ""Nashville hot"".  Slopping a glob of burnt cayenne sauce on a piece of chicken does not make it proper.  I'm sure the other chicken is good, but the ""Nashville hot"" is anything but.  Yes, it's hot.  But it shole ain't Nashville style."
"It's dangerous that I live so close to The Roost Kitchen. I want to go far more often than I go now. I've never had a bad meal at their shop or from their food truck which is one of Chicago's best trucks. I've brought family here and they loved it. The Hillbilly Tacos (when available) are my go-to for lunch/dinner and The Rheny (fried chicken, bacon and cheese on a biscuit) is my go-to for weekend lunch. I wish I had some now."
"I want to thank whoever opened this place because it brings a joy to my heart! The biscuits are great, the Mac and cheese is even better, and of course the chicken is FANTASTIC."
"3.5 StarsThis place is the model for a 3 Star establishment.  Everything is good, but nothing is memorable.  The Nashville Hot Chicken Biscuit (or Sandwich if you prefer) is good, but not great.  To call it Nashville Hot is a untrue as it is much milder, it is nothing like Hattie B's in Nashville.  The biscuit was the best part of the sandwich.  The Mac N' Cheese is average.  The service was great, the cashier was helpful, and everyone seemed happy which is the reason for the 1/2 star. I WILL BE EATING HERE AGAIN, but it isn't added to my normal rotation.  I would recommend that you give it a try too."
Simply awesome!!! Happy to have found this chicken shack. The best chicken in Chicago. It's fresh and the quality is always consistent.
"So happy about this neighborhood addition.Spicy chicken was juicy, tender with a tiny kick. Biscuit was perfect. Sandwich came with pickles, coleslaw and chipotle mayo. Sides are more than generous portions. I had the baked mac & cheese which was gooey and covered in toasted bread crumbs. The peach cobbler is delicious and very sweet.With a sweet tea, the total came to $11. Totally worth the money.I suggest if you go with another person and both get sandwiches, just have one person order it with sides. Unless of course you want to try more things!It's made to order, so it takes some time. But well worth the wait."
"So earlier tonight, i was headed to Cumin to pick up some solid Indian take-out, and my mind went briefly blank as I hit the radius of Harold's Chicken.  Hypnotized, I forgot where I was and headed that direction before snapping out of it.  That's who I am, addicted to fried chicken.  So this explosion of intelligent, quality fried chicken spots popping up all around me has been marvelous.  Especially now that I'm a few blocks from Leghorn and a short ride over to Parson's.  Having said all of that, Roost rules them all in Chicago.  On my birthday last Sunday, a few hours after going to bed, I awoke to have brunch with my sister and infant niece at about 1130.  It hurt, but family taking you out for your birthday soothes all. Rarely have small sacrifices been rewarded with so much happiness.  We were one of 2 tables when we ordered our bone-in fried chicken (thigh and breast) and boneless Spicy Chicken biscuit with mac n cheese and apple cobbler.  I respect that it still took 10-15 minutes to get our food despite no one in front of us.  That's fresh.   The sides were solid but not memorable. But that chicken!  Granted, time may have slowed down and it may not have taken that long to plow through my plate, but it was a steaming inferno the entire meal.  The pieces were a bit smaller than some, which I take to suggest organic and a more consistent cook at high heat.  The breading was less flaky and more crumbly for those that have a preference.  The meat was perfectly cooked, moist, bursting with flavor.  But I'm not sure that the chicken biscuit didn't steal the show.  That biscuit was immaculate.  Sorry Leghorn.  As some have mentioned, it is certainly on the salty side, so be warned.  I didn't mind given the solid Southern representation of sweet tea in a mason jar.  Roost - Parsons- Leghorn- Harolds---------Honey Butter-Chick-Fil-A.  And just a year ago I was mourning having to forgo my 2-3 Chick-fil-A sandwiches a month.  What a reward."
"Epic Fried chicken! Super crispy, juicy, and well spiced. Their ""Spicy"" is actually spicy, so hard to find these days. You'll wait a bit once you order (it's not fast food), but it's well worth the wait. Seating is limited. BYOBAnd they have BISCUITs - I went to school down south and love a good biscuit. Their's are big and soft, not as crunchy as a prefer, but the flavor is spot on!I suggest the Nashville hot biscuit sandwich with pickles - it's huge for $6 bucks. Will be back for another."
"I usually don't like biscuits or fried chicken, so listen up.This place is amazing. I originally wanted to go to City Farm but when I saw they closed, I figured I'd check this place out with my husband, who loves all the food.1) It's BYOB. I'll save you the research and tell you that a wine with high acidity is great with fried chicken, so go for a sauvignon blanc, pinot grigio, or a sparking wine.2) Try all the things. Better yet, go with a group of people so you can share. We got a ton of food for two people and only spent about $25.3) Be aware of the spice level. There are three kinds of chicken: herb seasoned, spicy, and nashville hot. The herb has no spice at all and is, well, herby. It's a bit plain compared to the other two but is still great. The spicy is my favorite- it has the kick and flavor but allows you to still consume it all with no problem. Now the nashville hot, aka the devil. Oh man. I like spice, I do. This was so hot that that's how we ended up with the herb seasoned- I actually had to order more chicken because I couldn't even take one bite. My husband ate it all and easily produced about 20 napkins full of sweat and boogers. He loved it, but be aware.4) Sides: again, the spice. Everything seems to have it. The mac 'n' cheese had a bit of a kick to it and dare I say the chips? Make sure to get the delicious cucumber coleslaw to help cool your mouth down, as well as the peach cobbler. Also, don't skip out on getting the ice cream on top of the cobbler. Your mouth will thank you later for the cool down. 5) Yes, the biscuits are really that amazing. As I said before I don't like biscuits. We got the spicy chicken biscuit sandwich with chipotle ranch and coleslaw. It was beyond my favorite thing. I was obsessed. At one point it became a bit hard to eat- the biscuit was falling apart-but I didn't care. I ate it all.If you're honestly still reading this, go you and go eat all the food."
"If you love fried chicken, you've got to check out The Roost. I live near the restaurant, and one morning while I was out on my balcony, I could detect the smell of fried chicken in the air. Could it be? A fried chicken place as a next door neighbor? The bone-out chicken sandwich on a biscuit with the chipotle ranch sauce is dirty good. The biscuits ROCK--the owner takes great pride in his biscuits, and with good reason, and the chicken is cooked perfectly with a nice kick. I've liked the fried chicken as well, but right now, I'm hooked on those sandwiches and the biscuits. I can recommend the mac & cheese, and I always love hand cut potato chips.Thrilled to welcome The Roost to the neighborhood."
I have dreams about this sandwich. I've gotten three people hooked on it just as bad. Hands down the best sandwich in Chicago. Have waited an hour for my sandwich and it's well worth the wait
"Madre De Pollo! this chicken is so good. I can't stop coming here.  they do chicken and they do it better then good.  The other day my wife and i bought all this food from the grosser and we had a stocked fridge. But i was craving the roost.. knowing that she wouldn't want to go if we had food at home.. i was for forced to throw away one weeks worth of food just to get to this place.. i know what you're thinking. ""why is this guy wearing a suit in his picture"" it was a wedding people. anyways.. yeah.. this Chicken is great. only thing that sucks is the wait.. call ahead. Also, don't for get to have the money sticking to your forehead.. .. like lick the $20 bill and put on your forehead... you get 20% off.. its like a secret menu thing.  your welcome"
"it's one dope sandwich. Haven't tried the sides yet, but the regular spicy is just right, and the beauty is in how juicy the chicken is. I've sent 3 or 4 foodie friends there and they agree this is a top-notch choice for a quick bite.I've ordered it for pickup on Sundays (when hungover, naturally), and stopped in before afternoon Cubs games as well. I do BYOB in those instances."
"I know KFC coined the phrase but this is some finger lickin' good ass chicken.I popped in here with a few friends as I'm a huge chicken fan and AFAIK there aren't a lot of dedicated non-chain fried chicken spots in the city, so that added to the allure.I ordered a quarter chicken of the Nashville hot chicken, with sides of slaw and homemade chips.  My friends ordered a spicy sandwich and a quarter spicy chicken.Holy crap this chicken was good.  I tasted my friend's spicy quarter and I ended up preferring it slightly to my Nashville hot - but both were fantastic.  The meat was cooked perfectly, high quality pieces; no cost-cutting here.  As for the sides - I believe the slaw was seasoned with vinegar and dill - a unique take that I enjoyed.  The chips were also great - crispy, fresh, and delicious with some hot sauce + ketchup.  If you get a sandwich, I recommend throwing a few of the chips on there .. mmmmService was friendly, responsive, and hassle-free.  BYOB as well if you're feeling a little cheeky ... I'll most definitely be back!"
"Found this place on yelp and it definitely lived up to its rating.  Fried chicken on a biscuit was amazing, haven't had that good of fried chicken in a while! The two sides were awesome as well, Mac and cheese and chips. It's a chill little place that you would drive right by without noticing."
"Discovering The Roost was only a few blocks from my apartment was both a blessing and a curse... This place is delicious, but I now find myself craving fried chicken and mac & cheese far too often for my own good!  That being said, the food here is well worth the calories.  The spicy chicken sandwich on a homemade buttermilk biscuit is to die for.  Other favorites include the mac & cheese and the bread pudding.  Top it all off with a cheerwine and you've got yourself a 5 star meal."
"The Roost is the best southern style fried chicken in the entire Lakeview neighborhood. Simply put, you just need to go, get anything, you will be so happy you did. My favorite items are the spicy chicken & biscuit sandwich as well as the chicken tacos, words can't describe it. Try it for breakfast lunch and dinner, at $9 a meal you should give it a try. What are you waiting for?"
"Where do I begin!?The food was phenomenal, I had the spicy chicken sandwich on a biscuit with a side of peach cobbler (hot out of the oven) and the homemade chips. The sandwich was juicy, crispy, and the right amount of spice. My friend got the herb seasoned chicken and the slaw, which he states was ""unparalleled"". The biscuit was moist and excellent with a little bit of honey.The owner was friendly and helpful. The southern infused music was a great touch to the atmosphere. Definitely recommend and will return!"
we liked it wed go back. fresh and tasty
"This place really lives up to the hype! I've been trying to get here for a while and definitely was satisfied with my first visit. I decided to get get the Spicy Boneless Chicken sandwich on a biscuit with sides of chips and coleslaw. My reaction was just....wow, so good! The chicken has this flavorful, crispy outside with a juicy inside. The chicken was cooked perfectly! But it was the biscuit that will keep my coming back - it was so warm and buttery! The sandwich was definitely worth the trip. The two sides were fine. The homemade chips were above average: they had a nice flavor and packed a good crunch. I would say the only let down was the coleslaw. The coleslaw was not bad just not as tasty as the other parts of the meal. All and all I would definitely recommend roost. It is a nice casual place with some delicious food. I'm already excited for my next time back!"
An interesting take on chicken & biscuits and mac n' cheese. The menu is fairly small but friendly service with good food. I'm not a big fan of chicken in general but it was pretty good nonetheless. Now.... The peach cobbler and bread pudding are to die for. Best I've ever had. Sorry mom.
"Deep fried deliciousness! This tiny little restaurant has quickly become a favorite for me and the boyfriend. I'm a huge fan of the hillbilly tacos and Mac n cheese. Takes awhile to get your food, but it's always worth the wait. Restaurant can get very crowded at peak hours on weekends, and there isn't a ton of seating."
"Stopped through last week to check this place out, and it met the expectations of the prior reviewers - tasted both the fried chicken biscuit sandwich (sweet 10lb, 3oz baby Jesus) and the fried chicken (bone-in) separately at the Nashville Hot and Hot levels... Both were excellent, but the chicken biscuit at Nashville Hot was outstanding... Mac & Cheese was pretty good, but the star of the show is the chicken. Will definitely be back - definitely one of my new favorite joints!"
"I think I'm in love.Just finished devouring a 1/4 white meat spicy chicken plate with the mac and cheese and the peach cobbler.  I kind of want to go back right now for seconds...When ordering the chicken, you get the option of white meat, dark, or a combination. The spicy breading had just a tiny kick to it, making it perfection. The chicken was juicy without being greasy.Usually mac and cheese is pretty bland at friend chicken places, but it was awesome here. It was really flavorful and was a good portion as well. The peach cobbler was the perfect blend of juicy peachy goodness and light and cakey. I don't like crunchy cobbler and I don't like my cobbler to be drenched in syrup, making the cobbler soggy.  This was the perfect balance.All of this for an even $9.  I got my order to go, but its BYOB and the place is pretty clean.  Its small but I've never seen it too crowded. I'm not sure how long that will last though :)I'd go before people start catching on and enjoy as much fried chicken as you can."
Just fabulous. Must be using White Lily flour for their biscuits as they are the most authentic southern biscuits I have ever eaten in Chicago. Well worth a detour if you are anywhere near Chicago.
"Service was slow but the meal was completely worth it. Don't come here without getting a biscuit (or 5). They're super buttery, soft, and tasty! Spicy chicken was pretty good, but the biscuit made the trip worth it. Definitely the best fried chicken sandwich in the city."
John is a very kind owner and gives you good suggestions based on your preferences. Atmosphere is adorable and simple. I ordered a quarter of the spicy chicken with cucumber slaw and Mac and cheese as sides. I think I was there first order so it took them a second to give me my food. But it was deeeeeelish. Highly recommended.
"This chicken is amazing. Super flavorful and fried crispy but not soaking with grease. The biscuits are insane. Careful - hot is HOT. The mac and cheese, chips and peach cobbler are fantastic. Food is ready fast and piping hot. Jem."
"Absolutely delicious. You've got to order the spicy chicken sandwich on the biscuit- I promise you won't regret it. It's pretty good with a slice of cheese too. And the baked Mac n' Cheese is soooooooo tasty. The owner, Joe, is an awesome guy and always so friendly. Enjoy!! I'll definitely be back."
"Where to start where to start.... WOW! This has to be the best fried chicken I have ever had the pleasure of eating. I walked in and when i ordered i was very surprised by one amazing display...the chicken isn't cooked nor even prepared when you get there, you order a chicken sandwich and a raw breast is taken out of the brine, dusted, and fried fresh right there -- TRY AND GET THAT AT KFC!!! I got the ""Nashville Hot"" sandwich on a biscuit -- DON'T SKIP ON THE BISCUIT!!! This one is unique, wow, I once thought all biscuits were dry (I'm a little sensitive to this) but wow, the most succulent biscuit I've ever had (not a way I ever thought nor thought would be appropriate to describe a biscuit!) This sandwich was love at first bite, I added some coleslaw to the sandwich and I think that was a huge move. I got a couple sides, homemade chips and Mac n cheese, and they also did not disappoint, the Mac even had a bit of a kick to it.I will be back here time and time again, recommending to everyone I know!"
"Inexpensive {20 bucks for my bf and myself for lunch! woohoo!} and seriously delicious! My bf and I are now fans of both their sweet tea and yankee {unsweetened} tea. Their fried chicken is phenomenal and peach cobbler, mac n cheese, and bread pudding was to die for. Seriously. SO. DARN. GOOD!!!"
"After hearing all the praise, Roost was a big disappointment. We ordered take out - orders of the herb seasoned for me and my mother-in-law and spicy for my wife. I do not like spicy foods, and found that the mildest chicken offered was too much for me. I don't think it was the coating on the chicken, but seemed to be on the bird itself. Whatever the origin, my stomach is still feeling it 3+ hours later. There was nothing that special about the chicken otherwise. My mother-in-law felt exactly the same way. My wife liked her spicy chicken, but noted that it was really spicy (and thus, the Nashville Hot must be nuclear).The sides were a mixed bag. The mega-biscuit was good. The macaroni and cheese was gloppy, smothered in pepper and just not very good. Both wife and mother-in-law liked the cole slaw. We also got the candied apples and those were good. Still, this is a chicken place, and it didn't do much for me, though if you like your bird hot, maybe you should try this place.One other note -- the take out number is a cell phone and no one picked up right away. I left a voice mail and was called back 10-12 minutes later. This was a turn off and if we weren't so excited to try this place, I wouldn't have bothered. But at least they did call back, I suppose."
Best chicken and biscuits in the area! The peach cobbler is also great. Seating is pretty sparse so be prepared to wait for a seat.
"Really good fried chicken as well as mac n' cheese.  A bit greasier then say Honey Butter Fried Chicken, but that comes with the territory. The biscuit might be the best part of the meal though."
Wow what a great fried chicken sandwich! The best buttermilk biscuit! Buttery goodness. Highly recommend the biscuit sandwich with sides. Mac n cheese and peach cobbler are pretty good. Will definitely be back for the sandwich.
"I come from the land of fried chicken; many restaurants in my hometown specialize in something fried, so I am sort of a connoisseur of fried chicken (not really something to brag about, I know). So I went to The Roost with a little skepticism and ordered a quarter of the light chicken, bone-in, served spicy.  All in all, the chicken was pretty good. They make it fresh as soon as you order, so it comes out nice and hot. Because of all of the grease, it falls apart and is very tender. I would have liked it to have been crispier and had more breading on it, but the flavor was good. For a side, I had the macaroni and cheese which left some to be desired. Some of the noodles were mushy and the sauce was okay.  The bread pudding was a bit bland.  I would say to give this place a try though and see what you think."
"Great chicken sandwich! Spicy sandwich wasn't that spicy to me, going to try the Nashville hot if I ever come back to Chicago! Would definitely recommend"
"Your fried chicken is the best I've had in a few years. I liked your simple vibe coupled with great chicken.I had 1/4 chicken, max spicy, liked it a lot. Wanted more.My son had a bone-out sandwich, I finished his. Wanted more.I want to go back next week.Simple, clean, good."
"My girlfriend and I decided to use Yelp to find something new to eat for lunch. We stumbled on The Roost and decided to give it a try. It exceeded every expectation we had for this restaurant. We walked in around 12:30 PM on a Monday afternoon and all of the seats were full but people cleared out quickly. I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich with chipotle ranch and dill pickles on a buttermilk biscuit. I chose macaroni and cheese and peach cobbler as my sides and also ordered a sweet tea. We ordered it to go and it was ready in about 20 minutes. Now I am a biscuit fanatic, so needless to say, I was excited for this biscuit and it did not disappoint. It was wonderfully moist and buttery. It soaked up the chipotle ranch and the chicken was juicy with a wonderful marinade. The macaroni was wonderful and the peach cobbler was perfect. The only complaint I had was that the sweet tea seemed pretty unsweetened. I tried my girlfriend's side of chips and they were seasoned well and tasted great. I will definitely be returning to this restaurant that could give Chick-Fil-a a run for their money!"
"I'm going to keep this review simple -- just like the menu and atmosphere.Herb fried chicken--good and moist; great rosemary taste. Nashville hot -- very good, much better than the Southern's Thursday special.Homemade chips--second best side availableBiscuit -- best side; awesome!!Cucumber slaw -- needed more taste. I'll pass next time.Mac n Cheese -- super dry (not sure if this was the case because we came around closing time. Saw it being reheated; might behoove them to cook the noodles separate and warm with the cheese sauce when ordered)Will definitely be coming back for chicken and the biscuits."
Thanks for cancelling our order Saturday night and not telling us while we waited. STARVING our asses off. WTF??? Will NEVER order from here again.
"I also stopped in on their first day open after a friend sent me an article this was opening.  The décor is nice, simple, and clean.  I believe the owner was working the counter and he was very friendly.   I ordered the spicy chicken sandwich and asked for the recommended toppings, as well as a side of cucumber slaw.  Really great sandwich: tender meat, flavorful spices.  The prices are very reasonable.    I'll be returning.  Welcome to the neighborhood!"
"What a fantastic addition to the neighborhood!  Mr B and I have had both breakfast and lunch at this joint.  Both are highly recommended!The chicken is fried to order and those sides...I'll dream about those for awhile. My favorites were the mac and cheese, chips, and peach cobbler.So go and get yourself some chicken, chips(homemade), mac and cheese and peach cobbler!  You won't be disappointed!"
I don't know how this place is recommended as the best chicken place by other reviewers. Popeyes is better than this place. Bought their special and it is not nearly enough food for what I paid.
Being from North Carolina when I saw this right around the corner from my new place  I had to stop. This is honestly some of the best fried chicken I've ever eaten. I recommend the spicy chicken. I find the Nashville hot too hot but I have the tongue of a 4 year old.  The Mac&cheese and bread pudding are absolutely delicious and the peach cobbler tastes like my grandma's. The best way to describe how good their chicken is  is i walk past Popeyes to eat here.
$36 for 16 pieces of chicken? Get bent!
"Love love love this place! Don't plan on eating in during peak hours as they get really busy, but the food is always spot on--- best chicken and biscuits I have had in a very long time. Awesome hearty meal for two for about $20!"
Very good chicken at a reasonable price. The breading is not greasy but the chicken is tender and moist. The Mac and cheese and biscuits are an excellent edition as well! I will be going back!
"THE BEST CHICKEN I HAVE HAD THUS FAR! This place is not only reasonable in price, but the food is amazing. I went there last night and now I am getting lunch there today. I highly recommend you try this if you like chicken!"
