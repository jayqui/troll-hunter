Pi-Hi Cafe
"Best takeout food in Roscoe Village.The staff and owner are great. Always up for a conversation and very accommodating to your meal. They offer a number of sauces/olives--- try the yellow curry- its great. Go to place everyweek when I can't decide what I want for dinner. Always get the chicken swarma, chicken curry, med salad. Wife loves the hummus- its made fresh daily and beats out anyone's in the city. Panini's are great too and good price. Overall, great experience."
"The food here is delicious.  Granted I've only had the pizza and the Mediterranean Plate but, the service is great, and it's clean and tidy, and this food is great. The place is a bit small, and it's across from Lane Tech so it'd probably hard to get a seat when school's out, other than that it's all great. We'll be back."
"I'm currently a senior at lane tech, which is right across PiHi, and I am here every single day !!! Not exaggerating. The food is delicious and the service even better, the owner is there everyday, greets me by name and is very attentive with his customersOne thing is calling and double checking their prices because some are different on the website. Very small place but great food with decent prices"
"If you are searching for a slice of Mediterranean heaven and wood fire pizza, the search is over. Visited this small restaurant last week and now I know what all the buzz is about! Unlikely combination of wood fire pizza, panninis and Mediterranean selections makes this place unique and able to satisfy a range of tastes.The moment I walked in I was warmly greeted by one of the owners, Ferris. The place was jammed packed with Lane Tech students and there were no seats available. He kindly let me know they'd be leaving at 11:30 and offered me lemon water. As busy as it was, he found time to speak with me and welcome me as I let him know it was my  first time at Pi Hi Cafe.Every person working here is very friendly and attentive. Excellent customer service is an obvious priority, as well as fresh and scrumptious food. As I sat down, I met the other owner and he was just as friendly and attentive as his partner. He offered me a free piece of baklava which was ooey gooey piece of sweetness. Their passion for good quality food is evident as I devoured my chicken kabob plate which had salad, rice, hummus and falafel. I don't normally like falafel, this one you cannot pass up. The hummus does not taste very traditional and I have no clue what makes it different. I cannot wait to come back and try their other dishes. Thank you Pi-Hi Cafe for treating me like family. We need more great restaurants such as yours. I wish you all the success in the world."
"So my boyfriend and I decided to try this place out. We walk in, place was full but we mentioned that we were both new and have some questions. Our server was extremely helpful and attentive. He sat us down and answered all questions and gave us amazing recommendations. We ordered the pepperoni Pi and the chicken combo plate (recommended by our server) and let me tell you, IT WAS DELICIOUS! We also each order their homemade strawberry lemonade and the regular homemade lemonade. Also GREAT. All Ingredients are fresh and the service is great. If you haven't been here, GO! YOU WON'T REGRET IT!"
"You can drive right by without noticing Pi-Hi, which is in a small strip on Western Ave.  Very unassuming front with signage denoting a fiery flame, but this camoflauges the name, especially at night. We wanted to check out the only Chicago restaurant that made the Yelp top 100 in the US!  Ultimately, good food on a budget, but I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here.  The owner couldn't be friendlier, which I believe encourages the glowing reviews.  The meat in the beef shawarma is fine cut so every bite is flavorful.  The plate is an excellent value and comes with rice, salad, falafel, hummus and pita bread.  I loved the beef shawarma and falafel, but the hummus and pita were lacking something.  The hummus tasted plain and the pita wasn't the freshest.A good wood-oven pizza has an incredible crunchy crust but their version was doughy.  The margharita pizza was covered with basil, and the herb overwhelmed the flavors.  The sauce was also on the sweet side.  I would return for the schwarma but not the pizza."
"It's really convenient for me to stop by Pi-Hi to grab food and since I love Mediterranean, I'm happy that it's so close by. The chicken shwarmma is fairly good so I tend to get a plate of that or sometimes the combo chicken which also comes with kebobs. The hummus is delicious and since most Mediterranean places don't include hummus in their meals, it's a really good bonus! On the other hand, the rice is rather plain though - it's missing some spices that could take it to another level. Also, the garlic sauce that I opted for on the side did not taste like garlic at all! Falafels - does not compare to Pita Inn...I am a strict believer that Pita Inn has the best falafels in the world so I was dying to try the falafels here given that some reviews have noted that the two are similar. Nope! Sorry, but Pita Inn still trumps all. It's not bad here but it's just not comparable. Sweet potato fries - Hm...what to say. Definitely not the best sweet potato fries I've had. It could be a bit crispier and less burnt on the edges though with more flavoring that actually sticks to the fries. Dolma - fairly cheap. You get 6 small ones for $2. I wish there was more stuffing to fill out the grape leaves.Pi-Hi didn't live up to its amazing reviews for me in terms of their Mediterranean food but I do plan on trying their pizzas and paninis later."
"Found this place and decided to try it. The staff was extremely friendly and willing to help up make our lunch choices, my wife got the Beef Shawarma and I got the roasted red pepper panini and a side of hummus. We were absolutely satisfied, I usually don't like hummus but this stuff was perfect. Perfect small place with good prices, if we are ever back in Chicago This place will definitely be on the list to visit again."
"After church we were starving and wanted something quick and tasty. Boy did we get that and more! Chris has some of the best customer service I've ever had. The bathrooms, which I count in my reviews, was immaculate, and everyone at the table was beyond pleased with their food. We had chicken schwarma and the beef combo. The beef was better than the chicken, and I'll be ordering that the next time we go. $30 for 3 people isn't too bad either!!!!"
"Pi Hi Cafe is phenomenal. Everything is top-notch. The service, the food, the prices. I can't say enough about this place and how great a job that Faris is doing here. My family has tried many of the items on the menu and literally every single one is amazing. Thank you for bring high quality, homemade, healthy, fair-priced food to our neighborhood, Try the chicken kabob plate. You will be hooked immediately. Dave"
"Brought a group of eight for dinner this week; solid across the board.  Even though Pi-Hi is a Mediterranean cafe, you walk in thinking this is a pizza place, but everything is pretty tasty.  I tried the sausage and pepperoni pizza, which was good and actually had enough meat on it to keep me happy...the fries, hummus and pita offerings were also good enough.  The real winner here is the falafel, which is bordering on my new favorite in Chicago (although I have had good falafel at places like Falafel & Grill in Wicker or Taza in the Loop)...very fresh, tasty, not dried out at all, a winner.  Prices here are very fair--I ordered some falafel and two individual pizzas and came out of this for less than $25.  Me gusta!Service is great and the owner/manager (not sure which) on the night we were there was very accommodating.  Also--BYO policy here is a little fuzzy, but for now assume that it's BYO if you show up close to 7:30 or 8 during the week and it's not crowded.  It sounds like you don't want to show up with your own booze here any time when one of the HS students could show up from across the street to grab a pie."
"What a hidden gem! I don't think I would've noticed this place if I had just passed by. Thank goodness for Yelp! We went in close to closing time on a Tuesday night. And the owner was nothing but nice, I'm sure a lot of other places would've been annoyed with someone coming in 1/2 hour before closing!I really wanted a pizza, but the oven was a bit on the cool side and I would've had to wait...and I was starving. So, I went w/ a panini. I had a chicken, spinach, provolone, roasted pepper panini. Once I got my order, I noticed that they forgot the cheese. I went back up and the owner and cook were SO apologetic! They must have apologized 10 times! That showed me they care about their customers. My husband had an eggplant sandwich and he enjoyed it. We shared a hummus which was yummy as well. I was watching other customers come in and all were greeted in a friendly manner. I will definitely come back to check out the rest of the menu! Love hidden gems like this!"
"Absolutely delicious food here. One of the best falafel sandwiches I've ever had. My boyfriend wouldn't shut up about how good his avocado panini was. We ordered delivery on a weeknight, and the food got here quickly. Bonus was the incredibly nice delivery driver! Would recommend this place to anyone looking for good Mediterranean food in the city."
"I'm rather amazed at the rave reviews for Pi-Hi.  What's special about Pi-Hi?  You can get a pizza and a shawerma together.  In the same sitting.  Beyond that, it's really decent to above-average wood-fired pizza and your standard shawerma plate with hummus, pita, cucumber salad, and rice.  If I lived nearby it'd be a nice place for take out from time to time, but I don't feel so strongly about it to make a long distance drive for a meal here."
"I wish I hadn't told my vegetarian/ piscatarian parents about this place- it's like the only place my dad wants now. For all you veggie eaters, he adores the eggplant and roasted red pepper panini- my mom likes everything veggie and not spicy. I almost lowered a star because I'm being forced to eat at this place twice a week because of the parents loving it. Obviously it's not the restaurants fault that they are so good but gosh darn it!"
"Give yourself a high five ladies!  You're number 100!!!  An undiscovered gem per the yelp data wizards (with help from darwin the dog).officialblog.yelp.com/20…google.com/search?q=yelp…Which is why I rode my bike out to this dump, proudly nestled in an ugly strip mall on Western and Addison next to a failing Hair Cuttery outlet.  Now I'll admit I was skeptical about 'top 100' status going in.  So there was a bad attitude from the start.  But in my defense, looking at their yelp pictures etc, it looked like just another of a  zillion low end/casual dining Mediterranean places that all have the exact same menu.  I couldn't understand how this place could possibly be one of the top 100 restaurants in the country.I ordered the chicken schwarma plate.  As a bonus, apparently, you get free nonstop ass kissing while you're ordering.  Pandering to the nth degree.   The dude would have literally kissed my ass if I asked him to, I think.  Made me a bit uncomfortable.  Like when a dog is humping your leg.  You're all...""Haha...I guess he likes me..Ugh"".  I grabbed a seat at the counter next to the window.  I had my elbows up like a little kid at the grown ups table.  Waaay too high.  Looking around the dining area, I could see the handywork of maybe one of the owners who can sort of build some things..but not exactly.  Overall it's passable but there are some screw ups.   Dude brought over my plate.   Had a falafel as part of it.  Excellent.  Really, very good.  And I've been to a zillion falafel places.  Hot, crispy on the outside, good flavor.  A+.  The schwarma was decent.  I think all medi places get their schwarma from the same supplier...on these huge rotisseries.  So hard to do much about that.At one point, while I was scarfing down the food, the head ass kisser was like ""hey I've got an announcement everybody, we've only been around for a year and  we're number 100 on yelp (bashful look).  unbelievable and thank u etc"".   Yes this happened.  Which I think is an honest response.  Overwhelmed and unable to comprehend random luck gifted by nerds at yelp and one dog.If this place wasn't a 'top 100' winner, I'd probably given it 5 stars.  That award is ridiculous.   So, I deducted one star for being ridiculous.   But hey, they're really nice.  Too nice now that they won the yelp lotto, but they'll get their bearings back in time.   And their food is excellent for a crappy medi place.   I've been to alot of these joints and I definitely agree they do a superior job.  Like 10-20% better than average."
"Excellent place!!  The people who work here are very friendly.  They gave us a couple of samples of one of their juices while we waited for our food- the strawberry lemonade, which is sooo yummy and would be perfect on a hot summer day.The falafel here is moist and perfectly seasoned.  We had two plates, the chicken shawarma and beef shawarma plates.  Each came with hummus, rice, pita, and salad.  Very flavorful, tender, with plenty of food.  They make their own pita chips which are really tasty as well.Great addition to the neighborhood, we will come here often!"
Very friendly and welcoming. They're a small place but very accommodating if you have a slightly larger group. Inexpensive good portion size for the price.  Parking available in front.  Excellent taste. Great choice if you're in Chicago and don't want to fight for parking down town.  Was so good we returned the next day for more.  Will definitely return next time we're in Chicago.  Wish they were in Hawaii.
"Yep, so this place is one of only two IL businesses on Yelp's Top 100 in USA, 2015.  The previous reviews pretty much sum up the place - great food quality, no frills, small space, great value, and a genuinely friendly owner.  I agree on it all and it is indeed a nice Chicago neighborhood stop (across the street from Lane Tech) for very good and economically priced Mediterranean.  The food is all fresh, made to order, and piping hot when delivered.  They use a wood burning oven here.  The wife and I tried a chicken combo plate ($8.95) and a baklava dessert.  Ferris, the indeed friendly Palestinian owner, also treated us to a sampling of their dolmas, or rice stuffed grape leaves, and they made for a nice tart starter.  He prides himself on home-made freshness, and it shows.  He's been at it here for 14 months at this point.  Will try to make it back when in the area and in the mood for Medi."
They got it all here and it's all great. Amazing food and great service. The staff is awesome & very friendly. Pizza - AMAZINGShawara- AMAZINGFalafel-AMAZINGFries-AMAZINGParfaits- :-) A BLESSINGI definitely recommend this place.
"I've had middle eastern food and when made properly it is delicious.. Unfortunately my chicken kabob plate was very underwhelming. Flavorless hummus/rice/chicken ... The ""homemade hot sauce"" ....shouldn't be called hot at all. It wasn't even mild. I really liked the guy who took my order, I'm assuming he was the owner. Customer service was wonderful. Very nice guy. But as far as the food.. If you want middle eastern food, without that ""middle eastern"" flavor then this is the place."
"Ok, Let's start out by setting your expectations....Yelp's data wizards named this restaurant one of ""Yelp's Top 100 Places to Eat in the U.S. for 2015"". Which is an amazing honor, to say the least. Yelp drives businesses to succeed or fail, all based on a crowd-sourced reviews. These crowds are not restaurant critics or professional reviewers; they are (mostly) people like you and me trying to get the word out for our fellow man. This can certainly skew the score...But this is where expectations can be dangerous; especially when you might imagine what the 100 best restaurants in America could be. Visions of Michelin Stars start dancing in our heads, and avant garde places like Alinea, Grace, and The French Laundry are expected. This.Is.Not.That.This is instead an outstanding little Mediterranean restaurant serving up fast heaps of schwarma and falafal bedded in fresh hummus and baba-ganoush. They knock out solid wood-oven pizzas, great panninis, and really amazing smoothies. They pride themselves on making everything to order. No baskets of cooked falafel balls getting cold over the fryer waiting for you to order, nor spits of meat baking for days on end making a dry chewy schwarma. This also isn't a fancy Mediterranean restaurant to take the family for approachable ethnic food when they visit you from endless corn fields of Ohio; but instead a place to order delivery from, or to stop in as a small group for a casual lunch. What truly sets this place above the rest though isn't just the quality of their food; but instead the friendliness of the staff and owner. This is a true mom-and-pop joint, succeeding or failing by every customer who comes through the door. They could not be kinder or more generous; often even including little extras in your order when they recognize your face.Which brings us back to their place on Yelp's top 100 list....Is it what you might expect from one of the ""Top 100 Restaurants in America""? Probably not. But say hello to the owner, have a little conversation with him, and I guarantee you will walk out understanding why Pi-Hi get's reviewed the way it does, and truly deserves it's place on that list. Also, if you are a return customer, do your neighborhood restaurants (not just Pi-Hi) a favor and skip using grub-hub or a delivery portal. These services are amazing, and I would often be left starving if not for GrubHub, but they often charge 10-20% of the bill for the service to the restaurant, which can easily overwhelm a family run restaurant. Pick up the phone, call the restaurant to order for pickup or delivery, and feel good in supporting your neighbors instead of some silicon valley dot-com company."
"Pi-Hi is located in a very small strip mall. The workers are super friendly and one of them took the time to explain the menu. When asked which sauce I wanted, I was indecisive so the worker gave me all of them to try. The falafel and chicken schwarma are both good. The sweet potato fries have some spice sprinkled on them, but the extra flavor was a plus. The prices are also reasonable."
"Average place until you taste their meat... It is prepared with wood fuel which gives it an earthy wood charcoal flavor... Simply crazy good. The staff are very nice and down to earth. Will go there again and try other stuff.. I give them five based on the grill side of the meal and the service. The falafel can be better, they might be undercooked or I could be wrong and it is a matter of taste. The hummus seems to be hand made and felt fresh. Will give another update after my next visit."
"First time here, will certainly not be the last.  Cold lemon water awaits to help refresh diners.   We ordered the Chicken Shawerma plate and Godfather pizza.  The chicken was savory and succulent; salad and hummus very fresh and tasty; the falafel and rice were both delicious.  Pita these elements together with one of their 3 sauces (prefer the spicier red and tzatziki pairing).  Phenomenal!  The pizza was very good, but I think next time we'll try a more singular pizza.  I only say this because I don't think wood-fired pizzas needs a lot of traffic on top.  The Margarita or White Cheddar as cheese pizzas, or possibly a single meat topping will be next.  The also have a slew of panini's and solid lunch specials.  Super friendly, high quality service"
Great food. Kinda small inside and itll get even smaller if you stop in during lunch when the kids are still in school. Owner is a great guy. The baklava is better than most places. I tried the chicken shawarma and it was tasty. Prices are fair and reasonable.
"Amazing food, really clean and fantastic service. Love this place and they deliver! Fire-grilled, you can't beat it. Loved the panini sandwiches. Pizza is supposed to be incredible. Trying that next visit."
"Hidden gem with fresh ingredients and food made to order. We tried most of their sides including their really good and crispy falafel and flavorful dolma, all at a reasonable price.  Their paninis are super good too.  The entire staff was very personable and the owner really passionate and caring about this customers.  I definitely want to come back to try their brick oven pizzas."
Great oven cooked pizza. Great schwarma. Big servings. Great service. Old fashioned home made taste and feel. Best bang for the buck!
"If you love Pita Inn, but live near Roscoe Village in Chicago and don't feel like hiking up to Glenview or Skokie to satisfy your Mediterranean cravings... well Pi-Hi Cafe is the place for you!Everything is delicious, from the chicken shwarma to the 3-cheese panini! The hummus is super creamy, falafels are crispy on the outside, light and airy inside and pita is fresh and soft. Strawberry lemonade is made fresh and there are free refills. They even have brick oven specialty pizzas! Portions are generous and prices are reasonable.  Ferris and Mert (owners) are two of the most awesome people you will ever meet, they will give you samples if you want to try any of the food items. The rest of the staff are super friendly as well. LOVE THIS PLACE!!!"
"Tonight was our first time visiting Pi-Hi and after a MISERABLE 2.5 hour drive in bumper to bumper traffic, we could not have been happier! We called in our order based on the yelp reviews, but didn't have full access to the menu. The person who answered the phone was beyond accommodating and gave us some great suggestions.After arriving at the restaurant sooner than expected, we went inside, only to be faced with the extremely difficult decision of whether or not to order anything else. The owner suggested the chicken schwarma, and even threw in a couple of extra falafel balls so my fiancée and I could both try them. The pizza was out of this world. We typically like really thin crust, but they have figured out a way to nail the hand tossed crust so that it's perfectly doughy while still remaining crispy. On top of that, the price could not have been better. I don't know anywhere else in the city where you can get three meals for under $30.The guys working were fantastic despite the weather, offering great suggestions, smiles and A+ customer service. We will 100% be back...maybe even tomorrow (not joking)"
"Came here with my girlfriend last night and it was absolutely deliciousRecommendations: Smoothies, baklava, and the pizzaThe ownership there is also incredibly friendly and helpful, very down to earth people and the place and the prices reflect itWish them all the success in the world and will be back soon!"
"Affordable, tasty food and friendly staff.  Everything looked clean and we were made to feel welcomed.  We had a panini and beef schwarma. We saw someone else with a falafel plate and that looked excellent. Pizza looked good also. We will be back to try some different dishes."
"The service was excellent and the food was great too! We had a large group and ordered a little bit of everything. Sandwiches, plates, and pizzas were all delicious. Even if the food was just okay, I would return for the friendly and efficient service."
"Literally my new favorite Mediterranean restaurant! I placed an order for delivery, and realized a bit later that I wanted to add two more dishes to my order. As I'm calling, the delivery man gets here and I realize it's too late to add on to my order. But the owner was sweet enough to send the delivery man back out, free of charge. Which was so nice! Now onto the food!.. Every dish I've tried has been delicious. Very flavorful. Workers are awesome! Delivery guy is awesome! Great staff. Great food. Great prices. What more can you ask for? I recommend trying the chicken shawarma chipotle plate if you enjoy spicy food. AMAZING!!!"
"Friendly, friendly, friendly! Still a great place to catch a sox game and a sandwich while shooting the breeze with the owners. Modest prices, killer paninis and pizzas. Quaint little lunch/dinner spot with lots of character. And quick."
Chicken was very flavorful and well seasoned. Falafel was very good as well. Perfectly crisp and very good flavors. The pita chips were great and the humus was pretty standard. I wish the rice was more flavorful.However for prices (which are a bit higher then posted online) the portions and food was very good.Would order again
"YES YES A MILLION TIMES YES! Seriously this place is ridiculously good. From the hand made falafel to the wood oven baked pizzas, you can't go wrong here. Not to mention the service is AMAZING. We ordered a half dozen falafel. The co owner came out with a plate with complimentary hummus and pita which was so nice. The falafels were light and fluffy -- easily best I've ever had. The pizzas crust was soooo good and buttered. Pizzas are hand made. The cheese was gooey and the fresh veggies and housemade hot sauce makes these pies delicious. And the prices are SO fair!!!!! Hell yes! I cannot wait to be back here!!!! (Probably tomorrow)"
Most every meal we've had there has been spectacular. A few weeks ago our order wasn't up to their usual standards and they have gone above and beyond to make right!! They KNOW service and FOOD!!!  Check them out. You'll be happy you did!!
Absolutely delicious ... Can't express how good the chicken was and the hummus was out of this world !! I would give 6 stars if I could !
"I have yet to try anything bad here. From their Wood Fire cooked pizza, to the hummus, to the Avocado Panini, everything is fresh and so good. Even the olives are tastier than the average olive! As for beverages, they have a great selection of tea for colder days, delicious Metropolis coffee when you need a pick me up, and my absolute favorite is the Strawberry Lemonade. Along with a super friendly staff, this joint is a true neighborhood gem."
"You can't go wrong, order everything."
Let me first begin by saying the service receives The owner was very personable and the employees were very helpful for a first timer! The food was real good. I got the 3 meats pizza which I was very satisfied with. The meat was uniquely seasoned and paired well with the rest of the pie.
This will be the highlight of your day. Good people making excellent food. Very friendly and welcoming place. Small seating area but everything else makes up for it. Best falafel you'll ever have. Oh...and don't wait for a table on the sidewalk during school hours..or else the security guy from Big Boy Gyros next door will approach you and ask if you are selling drugs..
"This is one of the BEST Mediterranean restaurant that I have ever been to. The food was great, the service was excellent, they give you a hefty portion, and they are reasonably priced. I ordered the Chicken Combo plate, which comes with chicken kabob, chicken schwarma, one falafel, salad, and pita bread. We also ordered a Godfather ""pi"", or flatbread and it was excellent; the fresh dough was the best part for me. I've been to at least 4 different Mediterranean places within a 2 mile radius of this place and hands down it is the best one. The owner came out to check on us several times and even let us try their olives that they marinate themselves. The olives were to die for; I could order jars of them. I will definitely be back here. The next time that I go I will try a smoothie and the lentil soup. I can't wait."
Extremely friendly staff. The food was obviously freshly made and the smoothie I ordered was prepared in front of my eyes. Definitely consider try this place out if your in the area!
"The food at Pi Hi was good. We had a bunch of stuff for lunch including Falafel plate, hummus, and pizza. All three were fine. What made my experience a 4 at Pi Hi was the service. It was almost funny, but every single employee in the kitchen came out and asked us how we were doing at some point while we ate. It was at least 5 or 6 times. Like I said, almost to the point of being humorous. It shows that they really care about customer service and that's half the battle."
"This place is a hidden gem in an uninviting strip mall of popeyes and nail salons. We were looking for a place to eat before getting groceries at Mariano's and saw this had 5 stars on yelp so decided to try it out.First off the owner was extremely nice and welcoming. He explained the menu thoroughly, everything is made fresh and you can tell after eating it.We had a chicken shawarma plate, falafel, garlic pizza, strawberry lemonade, and baklava. The shawarma and falafel were some of the best I've had in the city and I've tried at least a dozen difference places. The cucumber salad and sauces that came with were tasty, but the meat is flavorful enough on its own. The pizza was solid as well, they make it in a legit wood fired oven. You can tell that they aren't lying when they say everything is made fresh. I will definitely be back and recommend to friends. They also deliver through grubhub!"
Great restaurant for a small group. Food was flavorful and presentation was pleasing.
I was in their parking lot going to the bank when I noticed their restaurant . I yelped it and said I have to go in and check it out. I felt like I was a old friend of the staff and owner. They couldn't be nicer or more helpful . The food was great. What a find will be back.
"The falafel was killer. The wood fired roasted garlic pizza with a crispy on the bottom, bubbly and soft on the top crust was delicious and loaded with garlic. The ""godfather"" panini did not skimp on the toppings. The beef kafta plate, was freshly cooked and the meat was hot off the grill.Everything in this tiny little restaurant seems terrific, and the owner could not have been more friendly. Normally for an establishment like this, 4 stars might seem excessive but the customer service was legitimately so welcoming and warm, an additional star is required. Oh, did I mention it's dirt cheap? Because yeah... it's dirt cheap. Not necessarily a destination restaurant, but if you are in Roscoe Village, and you're hungry, give Pi-Hi a try."
"I really like this Mediterranean restaurant! I have tried the falafel, chicken kebob and shwarma, and the beef combo plate - all were delicious. The quality and freshness of the food is immediately noticeable, yet this restaurant is very affordable. The owner is very friendly and gracious, and obviously passionate about the food and restaurant. This place proves that you don't have to spend a lot of money for top quality food. I look forward to trying other items on their menu."
"In the middle of a modest small strip, this place is super tasty at reasonable prices.  We've been here a few times, haven't had the pizza yet, but here's what we love...Mediterranean salad....bigger than u think, given the price, and the right balance of veggies, lettuce, feta.Beef shwarma...amazing.  burritosized.  Again, just the perfect combo of veggies, beef, sauce, and the pita is light, not hard at all.Panini, delicious.  Many choices of cheese, invluding pepper jack, that you can pick from.Staff is friendly and we met the owner once.  seems like a hardworking passionate guy.  Hope he succeeds!"
"I'm convinced this place is only rated highly because it's across the street from a high school. It's par for the course, nothing more, nothing less."
"I really do love this place. The food has been amazing every single time and I would recommend that you try the beef shawarma.It's perfection and you need it.Also, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the customer service. They are always polite and friendly. They make their own falafel, marinated olives, and sauces then they just give samples with your order. Their service is something rare.You instantly know these men and women love their business and take so much pride in their service and products. They're amazing and it's difficult not to take notice of the quality. I hope Pi-Hi will be around for a long, long time.They also need to open a location in Logan Square or Avondale (please?)"
Loved it! We tried Pi Hi on a whim because we read such great reviews and I would definitely recommend a visit.I got the beef kafta plate and he got the pepperoni pizza and both dishes were so good we would go back again.Try it for yourself! It's a delicious and affordable hidden gem just off Western.
"My wife and I live around the block and decided to give Pi-Hi a try last evening. Our only regret is not going there sooner. We ordered the Sausage Pi and while we waited the owner Matt brought us out some falafel. Normally I am not a huge falafel guy, I find them to be somewhat dry or just lacking in flavor, but these were easily some of the best I had ever tried. Lots of flavor, good crunch and definitely not dry.The pizza was ready relatively quickly and as I write this I keep thinking back to how good the sausage was. It had an almost lamb like quality too it, delicious Middle Eastern spices, great crust, overall excellent pie. Combine the great food with the friendly inviting staff and you have a place that I will definitely be frequenting."
"This is a little cafe in the strip by Chase bank across from Lane Tech High School. Tiny but full of charm and quaint. Only 4 tables and a few stools by a counter. It WORKS. Food choices: Completely different than the unhealthy or routine options at other fast food places. Wood fire pizzas, delicious panini's and Mediterranean dishes. YUMMYMy husband had the chicken shawerma plate that he loved (he usually puts hot sauce on everything, but the taste and flavor of the chicken did not need any added sauce to change it up...so MIRACLE on my husband's side, Yay for Pi Hi's tasty chicken). I had the falafel plate which came with salad, rice, and hummus. So tasty.  I had their avocado panini a few days ago when my husband brought me dinner en route home from work. I LOVED it. They come with some home made marinated olives too which is better than a pickle in my eyes. ;-)Staff:Very friendly staff and work quickly and efficiently. Remember this is good food, not fast food so it takes a few minutes but they are quick. The owner is super friendly, professional and really has the customer's satisfaction at heart. Reasonable prices especially for the teens at Lane that want a healthier option than hot dogs and fries.  We will be back."
"Honestly, I'm not the type of person that takes time to write reviews but I think this place warrants it. We happened to go in when the owner (Farris, I hope I spelled that right) was working. This guy knows customer service. When he took our order, he stressed how much he really wanted critical feedback so he could make it better. We ordered a couple of limeaids to drink. They make them when you order so he brought them out in a small sample cup to make sure we didn't want them any sweeter. We ordered a half dozen falafel to go with a couple of ""pi's"". The falafel were amazing. They had a good crispy crust and the filling was great. We even had a good bit of hummus left over to which Farris brought us out some extra pita bread to finish it off. The pizza was pretty good, I had a godfather which I would call it above average. I didn't sample the wife's garlic but she ate it all so I'm assuming she liked it. I would definitely go back if I get the chance. I go to a lot of places and leave thinking that customer service must be dead. This is one of those places that restores my hope."
"If you're looking for some great food & CONSISTENT excellent service, come here. The owner will regularly give free samples to try different items. The prices are very affordable. Every item I've tried has been authentic and delicious. Great place if you like traditional food but they also have panini's and wood fire pizza's. An excellent addition to the Roscoe Village lineup."
"This joint has great food!  Had never had a ""Shwerma"" or whatever you call it but trust me here, get this sandwich!!  Tried a Panini and it was good as well, can't wait to go back and try some more things as everything seems to be homemade.  The olives they give you with the sandwiches are to die for! get dat did"
It cant get any better and simple than this!the specialty is their wood fire pizza...A MUST!pepperoni is 100% beef halal. delicious. A pizza/middle eastern hot spot. i tried their bbq chicken pizza and my daughter ordered the pepperoni. both were out of this world... the owner was soo nice and kind to have us try some falafel and hummus and sampled his salads. Tabouli seemed freshly prepared..two thumbs up for that.Highly recommend this place if ur in a mix of middle eastern and pizza mood.
My husband and I were on our way home to Ohio and wanted something tasty and quick for lunch. We found this place on Yelp and figured we would give it a try since the reviews were good. So glad we did! I had the chicken shawarma and my husband had the chicken curry. Both we very good. The portion sizes were great and we both left full. The house made hot sauce was flavorful and not too hot. The falafel was amazing! They had great flavor and crispness without being dry at all. The owner was super nice and helpful with the menu. You could tell he really cared about all of his customers. We will definitely be back when we're in town next!
"Pi Hi is the best falafel in chicago. I love me some Sultan's Market, but falafel is made to order. Ferris, the owner, is the nicest person on this planet. He is always the first person to greet me and ask me how i'm doing! The paninis are the bomb.com. absolutely light and crisp!!! Get the godfather (meaty and delish) or the avocado (with chicken, for a lighter fare) Ask for the hot sauce (it's very mild) and the garlic sauce! Also the olives!!!(homemade)The limeade is creamy and delish. Go during lunchtime for the lunch specials! (watch out during the schoolyear though, it gets extremely crowded)If it's your first time here, don't be shy! You'll be smothered with love and deliciousness."
"I was visiting Chicago and I looked up places to go eat. This one showed up and I decided to take the trip. First of, it was 50 mins or so from the loop. You take the brown line to get there. Now the brown line is a story in itself because of the architecture, it's beautiful. I was gazing out the glass the whole time until I arrived at the Addison stop. From there, I decided to walk a mile to Pi Hi on Cornelia Ave. The suburbs there are precious, totally worth it. Once I arrived I got two things here, the avocado panini and the chicken shawarma.The panini was life. The flavor was decent on the shawarma, expected a bit more. However, it's the quality of the ingredients that was impressive. Everything looked so cut, chopped, and freshly prepared, as if they had their own garden and farm in the back! The presentation of the food was lovely too. The service was great and so were the sauces. Definitely coming back to try more."
My experience did not match the five star reviews I saw on yelp. The manager was incredibly friendly and the prices were great but I would say the food was just mediocre. Maybe it was a bad day. Our rice was almost cold and the meat was a little dry on my Beef Shawarma. The Hummus was really flavorful  but  the pita wasn't anything special. I was also not happy that the the tap water had a hose water taste. I am willing to try again but I've had better.
"We ordered pizzas this weekend for the first time after finding this restaurant on Yelp.  We have definitely found our go-to pizza place - they were SO good!  I am looking forward to trying some of the other menu options, as well.  Also, very friendly staff and prompt delivery!"
This small but quaint establishment  has  delicious fresh made to order food. I loved everything! The owners were very nice and  accommodating. We had informed the owner that it was our first time and he went through the menu and took  time out to get to know us. Enjoyed our time and the food. Defiantly going back and can't wait to try the entire menu!!
"Great staff, good deals on the pizzas, falafel is amazing, smoothies also fantastic.The owner Farris informed us that the sausage and pepperoni are pork free so I know what we are getting next time.. although the bbq chicken pizza was amazing"
"If not for Yelp, I would have continued to drive by this place as I live close by but I am glad that I did. Came in on a Saturday afternoon and tried the Godfather pizza (excellent) as well as the falafel plate which was tasty as well. The staff is so friendly and I for sure will be ordering delivery from here in the near future. Great local place! Keep up the good work."
"I think I've found my new favorite lunch spot! So I work in the area, and I'm always going to Mariano's and chipotle. Well one day I was craving middle eastern and when I yelped the area I came across this place with its AMAZING reviews. How did I not know this place existed?? Went there and ordered a chicken shawarma pita sandwich. Checked out their menu while I was waiting and saw that it's not just middle eastern but also wood fire oven pizzas! They all sound yummy too. I started talking to the owner (I think it was, just seemed like he would be) and I was telling him how I wish my work would cater from here instead of some of the very unhealthy food they usually do. Then my sandwich was ready but he had me a wait a couple mins longer and he ended up giving me two big sides of their homemade hummus and pita chips to bring back to my work for everyone. What a great, cheap place for a quick bite. (I left a menu along with the hummus in my works lunchroom- hopefully whoever does the ordering for catering sees it!)"
"Pizza is incredible. It's light enough not to be ""too much"" and make you feel like a bloated meat sack, but it's still utterly filled with flavor and satisfies the appetite.The staff is warm enough that you start to think Chicago has some of the nicest people on earth.The place is clean and has a working bathroom.Prices are incredible. A 10"" specialty pizza for $8?!?There are all sorts of other menu items I didn't try (Paninis, Smoothies, Fresh Juice, etc...) so can't comment on. But if they're anything like the pizza I would order them up in a second.This place really does deserve a 5-star rating with its 70+ reviews."
"I stopped here because I was in the neighborhood and I love Mediterranean food. The staff was friendly and welcoming, and it was a great dining experience. In addition to Mediterranean food, they offer wood oven pizzas and sandwiches. I'll definitely be coming back here again!"
"I love Pi Hi. I get take out almost every other week, sometimes more often. The staff is nice, and the food is great. I've had the pizza, kebab, shawarma, panini, salad, falafel and everything is flavorful and fresh! I highly recommend Pi Hi cafe!"
Pi-Hi deserves every bit of praise it's receiving. Not only do they have fantastic food the owner and employees treat you like family. A must try in the Chicagoland area!
"Just moved into the area and am always looking for new local favs. The food is good but the service from the owner and chef is sensational!! I went with my sister and her army... We order 3 pizzas (they're 10"" pizzas thin crust) and a few sandwiches. The flavors were great and the food was fresh but what made the experience was the owner and chef brining us free samples of grape leaves, baklava and spiced olives.... Yumm!Best thing we ate was hands down the falafel!!! Even if you don't like it, you gotta try it as they were perfectly cooked and came with some very creamy humus. Don't be afraid to ask for sauce for your sandwiches. They've got some good stuff but you gotta ask for it.Try it, you won't regret it."
This is a great place to eat some healthy food & be treated as a person not just another number. The quality of the food is awesome!! The staff & especially the owners are very down to earth people & care about their customers. They are always willing to accommodate your requests. I recommend Pi Hi to all my friends & they all say the same thing as I do. Now days it's hard to find a decent place to eat that has all these qualities. The prices are reasonable too.MARK S.
"I'm currently a student at Lane Tech which is right across from Pi-Hi. The place is small so it gets pretty crowded when students are out for lunch. The people working there are extremely friendly and they always double check on you to see if you need anything. I eat here at least once a week. Their ice coffee is really good. I usually always get their paninis and they never disappoint. But the bread for the panini does have a bit too much oil so be prepared to use several napkins. I've had most of their paninis and they're all very good. Their fries are amazing with an incredible spice coating them. It's definitely something I've never had before. I love using the spicy ketchup for the fries. My friends rave about the chicken shawarma all the time and it's pretty good but I'd prefer my paninis. The shawarma does get pretty messy once it starts falling apart or I'm just a messy person. Overall, I love this place and their exceptional service and food always brings me back."
"This place has the best chicken Schwarma sandwich. It's moist, has the perfect amount of dressing and salad. I told my wife today,this is the best sandwich I've had in Chicago. The chicken kabob was a bit dry. I'm not sure if it was because I had it at the end of the day. Also, I did have a pizza there once and the bottom was a bit burnt so it kind of ruined the flavor of the rest of the pizza. Despite this, the chicken Schwarma is SO GOOD that it will be THE sandwich I order hopefully for the next 30 yrs. I only live a couple blocks away and we need some more quality restaurants in this area. Thanks for bringing such quality and thanks to the owner for being such a nice guy when we met him early on."
"Something is off about these reviews.  One step away from inedible.  I am fairly certain the hummus is just paste.  Took two bites only because I was certain after the first that it couldn't really be as bad as I thought it was.  I was wrong, it was worse.  The pizza crust was actually good but the sauce was so overpoweringly, white cane sugar sweet that the pizza was also left untouched.  Really unfortunate, I hate to waste food.  Panini  came without two of four of the advertised ingredients.  Are these people kiddlng?"
"So this place is right over there.  We saw the reviews on yelp and wanted to give it a go.  We walked in and were greeted by Super Friendly guy.  He explained our options enthusiastically to be sure.  I was in the mood for chicken skewers, baba gannoush, and dolma (like always).  It came with fried pita chips (if you choose).  That's right, fried pita chips.  It was a total yum.  (Although I added additional lemon at home). Super friendly guy even gave us a sample of all their tahinis to add to our dishes.  Very reasonable , too.Great option for healthy, quick food.I can't wait to try the pizza and paninis.  You must go to there.  :)"
"Love Pi-Hi! Went there last night after seeing the Yelp reviews.  It is a very non-discrete place in a small strip mall.  For a restaurant that has only been open a short time, they seem to have really mastered their customer service and food. The owner was very kind, generous and welcoming.  The food was delicious-great hummos, falafel and the chicken kabobs were very tender. All very fresh tasting. They have a fun Mediterranean restaurant meets cafe feel...they offer a variety of great teas and you can also get coffee, desserts and fun paninis. It was a different, yet very enjoyable experience. Please go. Just go. Wonderful place, I can't wait to go back!"
"Placed an order online a few hours before my work break. I went and my pizza was coming out of the oven right as I arrived. I ordered the roasted garlic. The crust was cooked to perfection and the tomatoes were fresh. My only complaint was that there was an excessive amount of diced garlic. I cook with a ridiculous amount of garlic and I can't live without it, but the garlic on this pizza was way too much, even for me. I'll definitely be coming back here, although maybe ordering a different pie."
"I am absolutely shocked that this place has such good ratings after my experience last night.  Maybe the quality of food and service is better when dining in the cafe, but the delivery was awful.  Whoever was the delivery man, he was incapable of buzzing himself into the building, did not carry a pen and delivered our food cold.  It started with the order.  The lady who assisted me was spaced out and needed to be repeated information 3 times.  Okay, decided to proceed since the menu looks great and the reviews were so complimentary.Ordered the following items, with reviews following each.- Mediterranean salad: Since when is this salad prepared solely with romaine lettuce, feta cheese, and toasted pita bread?  I found 2 small pieces of tomato and 1 piece of cucumber.  Really?  The feta cheese tasted like the cheap Athenos brand (dry, flavorless).  The dressing was off too.  Not sure where they picked up their recipe, but I'm pretty sure this salad is made with olive oil, vinegar, salt, peper and oregano.  God knows what was in that dressing, but it tasted weird.- Margherita ""pizza"" - If that's pizza, I must be eating something different at all other places.  Nevermind the fact that there were two specs (and I mean specs) of fresh mozzarella cheese, it arrived COMPLETELY COLD!  I live 5 minutes away from this place.  Why was the pizza cold?  If I wanted cold pizza, I would have eaten the leftovers.- Chicken Shawarma Plate and Falafel - The only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars.  Meat was pretty tasty, but the rice reminded me of Uncle Ben's rice and not something that's prepared in the cafe.  Hummus must also be the cheap, yuckie Athenos brand.  Falafel was good.I recommend Salam for Mediterranean and Pizza Art Cafe for pizza.  Avoid this place, despite the fact that they deliver.  Never ordering from this place again!"
"Clean, friendly, healthy good food. I've tried several dishes from here and everything is tasty. They are very friendly and reasonably priced. Totally recommend it."
Love this place. Awesome food and awesome customer service. Order may be delayed because it takes a while to make but their food is totally worth the wait.
Came here with my boyfriend and it was delicious! Lane Tech students are lucky to have this place right across the street. The owner is genuinely nice to every person that walks in and the service is awesome. Definitely will be back!
"Fresh and delicious Mediterranean food. Probably the best I have had in the area. With very unique and eclectic menu and prices, that my humble opinion are too low for the quality of the food. The owners and employees are extremely nice, passionate about what they do and are eager to offer a free sample."
"This small nondescript restaurant doesn't look like much from the outside.  I decided to give it a try because I love Mediterranean food. The food is amazing and the service is beyond what you would expect from a small, order at the counter establishment.The owner takes pride and welcomes everyone.But really it is about the food, which is excellent."
Wow everything is good the panini and the home made olives the chicken plate and the service if top notch they go out of there way to make sure you are happy.
"Tried this place on a whim and loved it so much it's now my favorite Mediteranean place! Their wood-fired Sicilian-style pizza is incredible--a must try! I had their chicken curry shawarma plate and would definitely get it again and again. My husband had the chicken kabob plate which was also delicious. The plates come with hummus and pita, a tiny little side salad, a bed of rice and a falafel which was a great little flavor sampler. The owner is so friendly and the food is so great, I can't wait to go back there again!"
"Fellow Yelpers, please promote this restaurant with me!  The location of this place has had the worst luck with previous restaurants.  I know not why.  It is in the plaza on the southeast side of the Western/Addison intersection, on Western.  Too many restaurants have come and gone here in the last ~5 years.  But, I tell you truly, this is a gem that we all should strive to keep around.  That way, whatever you want is in that little plaza: donuts, gyros, schwarma, pizza, and Chinese!The food:High quality Mediterranean classics.  The falafel is rather moist; not that dried up mess you get at so many places. The hummus is top notch and clearly made frequently. The schwarma (both beef and chicken) are very flavorful and were not dry.  The Portions are worthy of proper nounage. The personal sized pizzas look like they could feed 2 mild eaters (quitters, in other words), or a single eater with a haven't-eaten-since-11:30-and-it-is-7 hunger.  They are wood fire cooked, and they are very tasty; though, to be fair they do not compare to the Med. food.The service:  I ordered a limeade through Grubhub.  Received a call a few minutes later, out of limes, but through no prompting of my own offered two drinks for the cost of the one, a fresh-squeezed lemonade and a strawberry lemonade, for the inconvenience.  Huzzah!Cheeers!EDIT: I've been back several times and each time I am greeted sincerely, offered a complimentary small lemonade, and have even been given a sampling of the house-made olives...on the house.  Only whilst dining in, of course.  Fantastic place."
"Ok, so I saw all the great reviews from yelp, and obviously had to try.  I had take-out...DE-LISH Chicken Sharwma plate.  So today, got delivery.  I ordered the pizza, thinking there is NO WAY a pizza and a sharwma place could co-exist...I was pleasantly wrong...pizza was delicious and fresh ingredients to boot.  My only thing would be that the sauce could have been a bit more flavorful, but again, the fresh ingredients made up for it.  I am happy this place is in the neighborhood...I will be a frequent customer!"
"My friend and I were hungry for middle eastern, and checked out this place. We had to wait for about 10min. For the food to come out, but it was worth the wait!! I had the chicken Sharma plate, she had the falafel plate. The portions were perfect for us, the lentil soup was delicious too. Definitely will come back again!"
"Pi-Hi Cafe is my very first review! How exciting haha! I came here with the fam for the first time and it definitely lives up to its hype. My dad said that in the 30 years he lived in this country this is the best pizza he's ever had. Their wood fired oven makes some bomb dizzle neapolitan pizza and they use fresh ingredients that will give you new meaning to what it feels like to eat an actual pizza.We ordered the sausage pizza (veggies included), Veggie Pi and Chicken Shawerma plate which were all delicious.Although I'm a fan of the Chicago style pizza (classic, crunchy thin & deep dish) this place tops my list as the best pizza in terms of portion size, cost, low food coma threshold, fresh ingredients and the vast array of popping flavor.The place is tiny and it's not your conventional wine and dine place, but don't be misled because their food is what it's all about. You know the old adage, good things come in small packages.Their staff was extremely friendly and they didn't charge us extra for asking for more pita. They know how to run their business and treat their customers with love and attention. I'll definitely be returning to try out their BBQ Chicken Pi and smoothies.To add a bonus, my sister left her purse at the counter before closing time. We called in the next day and lo and behold the staff said they found it - cash and credit still in its rightful place. You guys rock!"
"I came here when this place first opened when I moved to Chicago and have been meaning to write it up ever since. Better late than never, I suppose.  We ordered falafel, hummus, and beef & chicken schwarma.  The owner is incredibly friendly and proud of his establishment for obvious reasons.  The flavors in the food are very good as well as the portion:payment ratio.  You definitely get a good amount of food.  The falafel was crisp and delicious and the hummus was incredibly creamy with a pronounced tahini flavor (good in my opinion).  We've been meaning to go back and try their pizza since I think they have a brick oven there, but that'll have to be another review."
One of the nicest places for a quick meal. We have eaten at the cafe (a very simple and small setting) and the service was commendable..friendly people who offer good recommendations! And we have also ordered food home and been happy with the delivery.we have almost tried everything (vegetarian) at this place and been very satisfied with the taste abs the quality.. definitely can't miss appreciating the reasonable pricing on all their items.. our current fave! :-)
"Delicious! This place is always a go to for us. Love the plates - the chicken is amazing, the falafel is tasty, rice, hummus, all wonderful. Amazing portions. What a gem!"
Loved this place! Its def a hole in the wall! A hidden gem. The customer service was great. Food was amazing. Prices are great too! I would def recommend this place.
"I just moved into Roscoe Village and scanned Yelp reviews looking for a good  pizza place. I was impressed with the 5-star reviews.  I was hosting a party and needed good takeout. WELL as the reviews said-- great food. I stopped in during the afternoon  to see the place, talk about the order, pre-pay and well--just check it out.  The falafel and eggplant was absolutely outstanding. My family loved, loved the wood roasted pizza.  I highly recommend ordering from Pi-Hi.  We will be back.  Thanks to the owners for coordinating the delivery and suggested menu."
Excellent food and service I had the specialty Mediterranean Pizza and gobbled down the whole thing in minutes. If you don't like close and comfy I recommend carry out.
"The food was fresh and there are plenty of healthy options. The owner made our daughter a free smoothie, then gave us all sample cups, it was delicious. This is a cozy spot with a wood burning oven and warm hospitality. Very reasonable prices, highly recommended."
I came in last year sometime when they first opened up.  The food was good and the service was excellent!  The area needed a Mediterranean spot and it got one!  A good one.  I'll be back to try the pizzas!
"We love this place! Great Mediterranean food at GREAT prices!! We love the chicken combo plate, falafel, and chicken kabob sandwich. The owner knows his stuff and is very, very hospitable. I definitely recommend this place :)"
"Amazing food at great prices. Both the pizza and Mediterranean menus are great.  Best Beef Kofta I""ve had around Chicago.  On a side note - the owner is super nice and sociable and will make you want to come back."
"Run, do not walk, to Pi Hi Cafe!  Ferris and Matt run a great restaurant... very good food, very reasonably priced and willing to go out of their way for you.  They are local guys and I love to shop and support local businesses.  They certainly make that easy to do!  The Godfather pizza is wonderful and I add things to the Mozzarella basil panini to make it my own (eggplant and avocado).  These guys know what they are doing!"
"This place is AMAZING! I saw a couple of good reviews about this place and decided to give it my own shot. The owner is one of the nicest people I've ever met! We got samples of their falafel, hummus and lemonade. The food was delicious, great service and it was affordable! A must if you are in the neighborhood!"
Best customer service. The food is delicious. There's a at home welcoming feeling about this place. It's great
Delicious. I have been twice. The ambiance is down a notch but the quality of food and affordability is great. A slam dunk for carry out or lunch while dining in. Dinner too if you are not feeling fancy.
"This is a small yet warm feeling spot. The owner was very nice and chatted with us for a while. He was very enthused about his new place and emphasized about slowly growing his menu and listening to a lot of customer feedback.We went during lunch and while there were kids from Lane there it wasn't noisy or off-putting. There is seating for maybe 14-16 people or so. The interior seemed quite clean and cozy.The food was excellent. We had a sample of the Nutella shake, being a fan in general of Nutella I thought it was stellar. My friend and I both ordered a Beef Shwarma plate. There's a decent portion of meat over rice and it comes with a salad, hummus, and, one falafel. The flavor was pretty good on all items. The salad was perfectly dressed and probably the best I've had from middle-eastern fare. Parking can be a little bit of a hassle for this plaza but it's well worth a stop."
Pepperoni Pi! nuff said.   Incredible Service. The mediterranean menu is very delicious and very affordable.
"I had never tried Mediterranean food prior before eating here and my experience was great!. My girlfriend and I decided to come eat here since it's  near to my home and the owner welcomed us in such a nice manner. We were offered a falafel sampler as we waited for our food and it was exquisite. I tried the beef shawarma plate and my girlfriend had the chicken shawarma, both plates were delicious. This is now my favorite spot to eat and definitely recommend this place especially for those who haven't tried Mediterranean food."
"Tried this restaurant for the first time the other day. The food was delicious, the service was very polite and genuine. Tried the cheese pizza, falafels, beef shawarma, Mediterranean salad, and it really was all top notch. You get so much food for such a reasonable price. There was more than enough left over for a second meal. We will be coming back very soon soon."
"Freaking delicious!  The wood fired pizzas are incredible, fresh ingredients and perfectly balanced flavors.  Tried a shake and a smoothie too, also fresh and flavorful.  Woke up all my taste buds.  Employees are really friendly.  Highly recommend this place."
"Legit. My wife loves med food and I love pizza, now we are both covered. A+ on both accounts. Love the pepperoni, wife loves the  chicken kabobs. Wish they were BYOB but everything else is aces."
"I was there for lunch.  The place is small so intimate talks are out! Lol. I ordered Avocado Sandwich for $4.50. People and Service was nice. Very hospitable! I will go back again. There is nail salon next door which I highly recommend. Price, Service, and people are great!"
"I was excited to try pi-hi based on all the incredible reviews. It's close to my house and they were generous enough to donate a portion of the evening proceeds to the neighborhood elementary school. I ordered several items which totaled more than $40. The order included falafel, baba ghanoush, hummus, chicken shwarma and tabbouleh. It all wound up in the garbage. It wasn't edible. We kept trying the food because we couldn't believe it was that bad. I have never seen Yelp reviews that do not match with the taste of the food. The owner was very friendly but his personality can't make up for his product. There are two much better Middle Eastern ( Turkish) restaurants in the neighborhood. I love Middle Eastern food and eat it often. I know  good Middle Eastern food and this certainly is not it."
Place was recommended to me by many and I finally decided to try it today. I tried their specialty pizzas and I would highly recommend getting any of them.  I have yet to try the Mediterranean food but I don't believe I'll be disappointed.
This is one of my favorite places to go to for lunch! I'm a lane tech student and am here nearly everyday. It's affordable and much healthier than some of the other local lunch options. The hummus is delicious and the smoothies are fresh. The staff is friendly. I enjoy the small atmosphere!
I ordered takeout from Pi-Hi Cafe because my brother had eaten there once before and said their wood fire pizza was awesome! Their pizza's are personal sized so we got two to feed 2 people and we had about 2 slices of each leftover. The pizza is amazing as well as the service. The owners were there and were so friendly and eager to give us a free sample of their house marinated olives. I can't wait to come back and eat again. The prices are all very reasonable and there are so many different menu items to choose from. I highly recommend you try this place!!
