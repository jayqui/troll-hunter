Little Goat
"This place is perfect for drinks (there is a bar), coffee (there is a coffee bar), bagels (best cream cheese flavors in the world!) and brunch (even if it's brunch for dinner). I love every single thing I've had here. But that being said, don't expect to find anything super nutritious - everything is mega-packed with calories, but very very delicious ones!All of the following were tried and approved by our party:Pork Belly Pancake - Perfect balance of sweet and savory!Machos Nachos - This is huge!! Really perfect for sharing (and caring)Chili Goat Cheese Fries - A heart attack on a plate, but worth every palpitationFried Pickles and Onions - Gotta get yo' pickles!"
"Went to Little goat on a Sunday afternoon to get some food. I shared a sandwich (Los Drowned) and the fried pickles and onions appetizer. We also shared the Mac N Cheese. Overall the food was really good, the sandwich was top notch and would recommend it. The Fried Pickles and onion rings were also really good. For the price I thought they were worth it. The Mac N Cheese was the only item I probably wouldn't get again. I just didn't feel like there was anything special with it. Overall a great experience at Little Goat"
"First of all, the service is superb. The wait staff was always attentive and did a great job in a busy atmosphere.After a few visits to the Little Goat we found the food to be great. Although, I do caution to be aware of what you order. The Goat Burger is one of the best burgers in the city. The Fish Tostadas are to die for. Their fries are great. There were a few items that we did not like, but overall the food was amazing.I would recommend this place to anyone who does not mind a slightly noisy atmosphere.Enjoy your food!"
"One of the best brunches I've ever had. // LOCATION // West Loop by Au Cheval and by the same chefs as Girl and the Goat. // SERVICE // Great. The waitress was super chill, but was very prompt and helpful// WAIT // Nonexistent on a Wednesday morning // FOOD //     + Orange Juice: Freshly squeezed, pulp-y and memorable enough to write about      + Bull's Eye French Toast: Soft, fluffy french toast with tender chunks of fried chicken. Great if you love the salty/sweet combo     + Smoked corned beef hash with eggs: Eggs any way you like it with savory corned beef and crunchy hash. It is an American breakfast done right. If you cannot get seated at Girl and the Goat, Little Goat is definitely worth a try."
"Little Goat is an upscale American diner that serves breakfast all day.  However, this is not a gimmick.  This is a truly great restaurant that serves up elevated breakfast dishes in a cool setting with several great touches that remind you the old great American diners.My Overall Rating - 4 1/2 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)Atmosphere - You see the words Diner on its windows, but the Little Goat feels like a nice upscale restaurant.  But what you'll find is they've woven the diner theme all throughout the restaurant.  Look around and you'll see classic round barstools, tables with metal trim, plenty of booth space, and plenty of coffee cups.  It's a great concept that fits the breakfast all day theme perfectly.  1 Star.Service - Our server was friendly & attentive, and was great tending to our needs.  But the restaurant was packed on a Wednesday night, and we had to flag him down a few times.  Service was delayed, but this is really due to how busy they were.  When available, our server was sure to get our orders in and did a great job following up.  Bonus, he made a few great recommendations from the huge menu that turned out to be table pleasers.  1/2 Star.Food - Breakfast is the most important meal of the day, and if it's your favorite it can be ordered all day!  We started with the nachos - but we had no idea what we were getting into.  We received a huge platter of homemade chips topped with pulled pork, beans, cheese, avocado, and plenty of other healthy toppings.  If you order this, make sure you have at least 4 people in your family to share.  But I was here for breakfast, so of course I order the Bullseye French Toast.  This French toast dish comes topped with fried chicken, egg, and of course BBQ Maple Syrup.  Sweet/Salty/Soft/Crunchy/Yes/Delicious.  And since we're eating at a diner, of course we order the Betterfinger sundae.  All you need to know is it comes with chocolate covered cheez-its.  Bottom line, not only did Little Goat's food surprise me, but the menu & dishes were whimsical and delicious.  2 Stars.Will I Return? - Yes.  I'm a sucker for diners.  Throw in one that serves creative breakfast all day and crazy desserts - no doubt I'll return to the great Little Goat.  Just beware they do get busy, but when you're the best at what you do people will come.  1 Star.My Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. Each Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.  I will sum them up to provide my final Yelp score."
"I cannot tell you the number of times we tried to dine here but were too hungry and impatient to wait for an available table. So, you can just imagine my happiness!They offer valet parking for those of us who commute the hard way. The valet parking attendant has a designated area for motorcycles. By this I mean, you self park it across from the restaurant but still on Randolph in a valet parking designated area so they can keep an eye on your prized possession.I am a bit overwhelmed by the name of my order and don't even know if I'm hungry enough for it today. My desire for French toast outweighs any negative thoughts I may be having about it. I don't remember the names of our orders but I have pictures!The staff is super cool to our furry companion. The hostess gave her a dog treat from their bakery and another stopped by with a bowl of cold water.I don't know of any other place I've ever been to where I left feeling like I've made friends with complete strangers. From the guy sharing the bench outside with me as I waited to be seated inside and he waited for his blind date to show up, to the girls we shared our table (a long diner like counter or picnic table with very comfortable stools) but not our checks with, to the hostess, to the other diners who came by to pet our service dog."
"Who: friendsWhere: west loopWhen: dinnerWhat: Asian salad, Revolution hibiscus aleWhy: Really enjoyed this place. After a busy day trekking around Chicago, it was nice to settle down at Little Goat's patio in the hip West Loop neighborhood. Thank goodness for a refreshing salad and a selection of Revolution beers. Good pairings all over the menu."
"The only thing I can say about this place is that it is very unique to try once if you're visiting from out of town, but if I was from Chicago or lived in the area, I honestly probably wouldn't frequent the place. Little Goat is essentially a diner with a menu not expected of a diner which is really cool and interesting, but at the end of the day, it's diner food: greasy, probably not the healthiest, but without the great prices of a regular diner. If you're going to try something unique, go for the pork belly pancakes - very good and very different. The smoked pork and toffee shake was also great (tasted like a salted caramel shake).The space feels like a slightly upscale diner but again, it's part of the experience. Overall, glad I tried it, experienced the hype, but probably won't be going again on my next visit to Chicago"
"Since it's nearly next to impossible to drop into The Goat and the Girl, my Chicago neighbors took us to Little Goat so that I could try the tasty offerings of Janes Beard award winning chef Stephanie Izard.The space has a lovely open air feel with outdoor seating that lines the sidewalk.  We sat next to a huge window in a spacious booth offering plenty of opportunity to people watch.  The seats were a bit worn and torn in some places but it is a diner.It's difficult to choose your meal as everything sounds delicious and in an incarnation you're familiar with but better.  So you've had French toast but bit garlic brioche French toast!  I ordered that with crispy chicken and strawberries.  My friends ordered a juicy cheeseburger and the tastiest fries I've had in a while.  We also ordered fried pickles.  Way to indulge!All worth it though.  If Chicago didn't have so many restaurants, I. would absolutely go back.  Service is decent and prices are on the high side of reasonable.  Expect to spend around $30 for breakfast if you want apps or a cocktail."
"After trying The Girl & the Goat on my last trip to Chicago, I was very eager to try Little Goat, mostly because it was a little bit more focused on diner comfort food, and also didn't require long waits or reservations months in advance.Little Goat has the feel of a modern diner, and it seems to attract both tourists and locals alike. The menu has all the diner offerings you could want: breakfast items, sandwiches, burgers, appetizers, and supper items. Yet, all of these dishes seem to be a twist on their respective classic versions. We ordered the goat patty melt, pork belly pancake, and the Korean goat burger. I wasn't pleased that the burgers didn't come with fries, but we ordered a side of the smoked fries, and they were great. The potatoes were cut just right, and the smokey flavor was pretty addicting. The patty melt was awesome, with just the right amount of goat to bread, and the pickles provided the sourness and crunchiness. The pork belly pancake was well-balanced with the vegetables and pork belly. The Korean goat burger came with an egg on top, which was super rich and delicious.Our waiter was very friendly and helpful with recommendations, but seemed to forget about our table at times. Prices are fine, although again, I think the sandwiches/burgers should come with fries. Just a pet peeve of mine. I really would like to try the Goat Almighty, which is the colossal goat burger with BBQ pork, braised beef, and onion rings, and many other toppings. One of these days, I will bring the full power that is my appetite.Overall, the creativity and the quality of food will keep me coming back to try all their offerings. For a casual, yet elevated meal in the Fulton Market area, you cannot go wrong with Little Goat."
"What a cute yummy place! We came here for dinner, where I had breakfast (the chicken 'n waffles), and then for breakfast, where I had dinner (goat loco moco). The waffles with strawberries was slightly overly sweet for me, but the chicken that went on top was so juicy and perfectly cooked! I love love loved the loco moco. The entire dish - with the greens, the rice, and the other stuff. The flavor profiles just meshed so well together. That ground goat meat patty was perfect! Ask for it medium-rare, not well done, and it will be so much better! The service is also pleasing and friendly without being overbearing. They're just cool people. I love the décor and the feel of the place with its interesting wallpaper and details like baby goats inside the coffee mugs. Cute! I also love that you don't have to wait insanely long or make rezzo's weeks in advance. That's def a plus."
"Been wanting to try this place out for quite some time, and I must admit, I'm NOT impressed. The food was just ehhh, nothing spectacular. The group started off with the nachos which were supposed to be BBQ style, there was barely any hint of BBQ sauce, they were stingy on the cheese and sour cream. The chips themselves were really good though. I wouldn't order them again. I ordered this sandwich with turkey and ham with their ""special"" sauce which was basically just mayo... They put waaaaay too much on, I could barely eat it.  Also, for 13 bucks you think that w any sandwich u would get fries, but nope, everything is la carte. Not sure what the big buzz is about this place, I wouldn't return. Oh, I will say that our service was good though! We had a sweet lil waitress who was a complete doll!"
"Little Goat. BIG FLAVOR.The set-up is just like a diner but the food is a million times better! Everything on the menu is so unique (and fairly priced for the West Loop!).I ordered the Crab and Shrimp dip and the fish tostadas. Let me just preface: Whenever I get a dip, I always assume there are a million calories so I try to settle for a little taste while my other half finishes the rest. Well...my other half wasn't in the mood for seafood and my will power wasn't on point so I ended up finishing the phenomenal crab dip until the dish was empty-it was that good! And an order of Fish Tostadas comes with 3 pieces piled high with their marinated slaw. When it came out, I didn't have enough room so I was able to get one crunchy piece in my stomach before they took the rest away to get wrapped. I still have to conquer the rest of the menu so I'll be back to try other things!"
My boyfriend and I live around the corner from here and this is one of our favorite places in the West Loop. He generally gets a breakfast dish and I have a new favorite in the Fish Tostadas. Every dish is excellent! Highly recommend! Side note: Their wait can be long sometimes so we like to make a res in advance on Open Table.
"Dining in the West Loop feels a lot like going to a theme park. Your first ride is dodging other cars and pedestrians in an almost endless search for parking. Then you walk through what looks like street after street of abandoned warehouses and it feels like a murderer could jump in front of you at any second, but in reality all you'll see are yuppies, hipsters and college kids. Finally, you get to restaurant row and get to stand in line for 2 hours while you wait for your turn (to eat).All that happened last night when we tried to (unsuccessfully) visit Au Cheval. Instead, we landed at Little Goat. The theme-park experience continued because our waiter looked like a male fashion model who stepped out of a ski catalog. He was friendly enough, but I admit that I couldn't hear anything he said because the music and crowd chatter are SO LOUD in there. My wife and I took to using gestures and charades to communicate before finally just giving up and staring at our phones. To put it bluntly, I wasn't that impressed with the food either. Everything we ordered tasted the same. Oily. And the sauces used for all three items were also very similar, a mayo-type sauce and a sweet bbq sauce. We ordered the crispy shrimp appetizer, the tonkatsu sandwich and the Korean burger. On the walk back to the car, my wife asked if I still want to try The Girl and the Goat eventually. I told her that I probably wouldn't based on this experience."
"Came here again and ordered the Korean burger, and unfortunately, I wasn't as impressed this time around by the food. The patty for the burger came out rather dry and slightly charred--and while I did ask for a medium well cook, I've definitely had patties elsewhere done medium well and still juicy. I also wish the patty itself was flavored with kimchi as well--the beef was rather plain and definitely needed the help of some seasoning. In fact, I found the entire burger was very dry overall--dry bun, dry patty, and the small amount of kimchi didn't help the situation much either. Fantastic service as usual, but food just wasn't up to par this time around."
"Five stars for the food and server, 2 stars for the wait and rude hostess.  Heres why: I had a reservation at 8:30, we arrived about an hour and 15 minutes early.  After a long day traipsing around the city we decided to see if we could get in earlier.  The hostess said 20-30 after that another 20 after that another 20 until finally many non reservation parties were being served before us.  What the heck?!   We finally got seated after a hour and ten minutes.The food was a different story, it was amazing.  Very flavorful with unique food choices that surprisingly taste really good together.  The servers were lively and helpful as well.  It is a bit loud, but overall not too bad.  To recap, great food, great servers, good atmosphere, horrible hostess...  For such a friendly place, why have some rude snarly young lady in the front setting possible misperceptions of the place?"
"This place is ok, and maybe I just had my expectations set too high due to all the hype, but our party left a little disappointed. Some of the things we ordered were better than others, we really enjoyed the tempura mashed potatoes, but the corn was pretty salty. Two people at our table order the skirt stake medium rare, and both had it brought to them well done. I had the Goat Almighty burger, and aside from it being an impressively large burger, it wasn't the best burger I've ever had. Salty, but lacking much other flavor. The atmosphere is that of an old American diner, which we enjoyed, but the noise level was so loud, we found it difficult to speak with the other members of our party. Service, on the other hand, was fantastic. Both people who helped us were polite, friendly, knew the menu, and we're just good at their jobs. We'll definitely try it again, as this place has a huge menu, but I think we'll give it a while before we do."
"Dude, are you guys serious? 1800 reviews and everyone blows their minds over this place. Like its the Jesus of diners. This place isn't bad by any means, but its definitely not one of the best brunch places in the city. So why the three stars? I'll tell you why.Its way overpriced. There's a reason why the prices aren't on their website. Even small things like sodas are 4 bucks. Want some fruit? Six bucks. How about some ice cream? Eight.Secondly, its not that good! The prices wouldn't have mattered at all if the food was awesome. We got the Bull's Eye French Toast and the Los Drowned, which were good, but for $30? Not really. The Bulls Eye was pretty substantial, you get a lot of food here. But the chicken was dry and overcooked. You really needed the syrup to help it out. The egg was also overdone, it would have been nice to have that yolk to sop up the excellently cooked french toast. The Los Drowned was good as well. The beef was succulent and came with some au jus that had great depth of flavor. But you get no sides. No fries, no chips, nothing. On the menu it said that it has avocado on it, which it did. But it was just a really thin spread on the bread. If you told me that there was avocado on the sandwich I wouldn't of believed you. It would have been nice if there were an actual slice of it instead. For a 15 dollar sandwich, that's what I was expecting. The pickled peppers were a nice touch though. I know I'm being harsh on this place. I know it. But people will throw their money at anything that has hype around it. The menu has a lot of intriguing things on it. And I know I'll get dragged back here because all my friends who visit would want to go. But when a brunch for two gets up to $40 and you realize that all you got was a play on chicken and waffles and and a sandwich, you start to question if it was worth it or not.Its not."
"At 3:30 PM, the place was still hopping with a long wait but the food is well worth the wait. We decided to go with both a lunch item and a breakfast dish. The lunch dish was the ""Los Drowned"" which is a braised beef sandwich with havarti, avocado, pickled peppers & onions and spicy mayo on a hoagie. For the breakfast dish, we wanted to get the bull's eye french toast which is basically chicken and waffles but they were out of that so we settled on the ""Fat Elvis Waffles"". These waffles are topped with banana, peanut butter-butter and bacon maple syrup. I'm not usually a sweet breakfast person but I could eat that again. Definitely a must visit when in Chicago."
"I was in town for Lollapalooza and my friend and I decided to take a break and get brunch, and we quickly found ourselves at the Little Goat. What a treat! There was a bit of a wait (45 minutes), however understandable since it was a Sunday. Well worth the wait! My friend and I couldn't have been happier with our selections. I had the parathas burrito and my friend had the bull's eye French toast, both were absolutely incredible! The parathas burrito was unlike anything I'd ever had and was the perfect combination of breakfast and lunch food, as well as southern and Indian cuisine. My friend loved her French toast and claims that it made her understand the hype behind chicken and waffles.The tempura mashed potatoes were also incredible and such a unique side!The service was also phenomenal. I will definitely return the next time I'm in Chicago."
"I've been here twice and both times I've been a little unimpressed. I don't know if it's because Girl and the Goat is THAT good that this pales in comparison, but I've had mediocre service both times, and while the food is decent, it wasn't anything crazy.The prices aren't absurd, luckily, but the diner feel + refined variations of traditional diner entrees kind of hit me as strange. Luckily both times I've gone I've gotten to skip the wait. I think I'd come again but never if I had to wait in line...which, especially on weekends, can get a little crazyPS I have to say, though, the choco taco = winning."
"Ended up here after becoming impatient with the 5 hour wait at Au Cheval, and was not disappointed. Little Goat has a diner feel to it, but the lights are dim and the music is fairly loud. The decor was trendy and features cute animated goats everywhere. They also hand out free goat pins by the door! We ordered the Los Drowned, Machos Nachos, Patty Melt, All American, Banh Mi Style, and Loco Moco. All the food was unique, flavorful, and very filling. The portions were, in true diner style, huge. The menu features classic American food with an unexpected twist. However, the menu lacks detail, so I would recommend asking your waiter/waitress for more information. For example, my friend thought she was ordering a burger and it ended up being served without a bun, but she thoroughly enjoyed her meal regardless.Overall, the food was great and I plan on trying their brunch in the near future :)Ps. The food is super messy. Would not recommend coming here with someone you want to impress lol."
"Loved it! I've wanted to go to Girl and the Goat for a while because I loved Stephanie on Top Chef. This was a great substitute. Its her food in a more casual atmosphere. The decor was 60s daytime sleek, and was light and airy. I had the bullseye French toast. It had poached egg in the center of each bread slice, sliced strawberries,  and perfect fried chicken chopped into smaller pieces. Everyone loved what they ordered. We also got dessert--the fat Elvis cake was to die for : moist banana with peanut butter bacon frosting. Deslicious!"
"Oh my!  I didn't think it was possible after 2 full days of eating and being un-wowed by the culinary scene in Chicago.  So after changing my search strategy to just high ratings, not necessarily the most reviews on Yelp, I came across Little Goat, which looks really cute and they do get high marks, but not necessarily the most reviews...so we make our way...It's a little further than the places we have been going to in the downtown area.  We finally start to walk up and I get a good feeling at just the way the street it's situated on.  We walk in and wow, it's so cute!  I love it!  It's got this retro earthy feel...lots of character!  That's what I've been missing on our trip.  I mean we liked RPM, but it didn't have much character.  We sit in a cute little 2 seater booth and the server, our wonderful Sara, greets us.  She helps us through the menu, Matt is being healthy and boring so he makes his own omelette and I follow her suggestion and get the Prathas Burrito (indian flatbread . sunny side eggs . avocado-bean salad . chili pepper sauce . sheep's milk cheddar), $13 and I also get one Sourdough pancake.  I was a little apprehensive about the burrito, but man when it came out and I tasted it, wow, it was exactly what I wanted!  It was tasty, creative, but actually tasted somewhat healthy too.  It wasn't too heavy.  But, most importantly it was delicious!  And when I finished that, I had the Sourdough pancake...no joke, best pancake I've ever had!  It wasn't doughy, but kind of spongey with subtly crispy edges, mm...so good!  I gave Matt a try and he agreed, it was pretty good.  Goodness, please go visit Little Goat if you haven't, it such a cute place and the food is so awesome!  Love all the character in the food and atmosphere!  And our sever Sara...she was super awesome and helped us with our dinner plans!  Her suggestions were Ada, the Winchester, Kuma, and a few other places.  We tried Ada and she was right, super awesome restaurant, again character in food and atmosphere!  I want to put this restaurant in my pocket and take it with me to Houston!  Obviously a must try!  =)Check out my blog for photos and more!"
"Oh dear me, l do believe the little goat may be better than the big goat.Here's is why I love this spot, it has the same inventive flavors less the pretentiousness.  this is absolutely my kind of spot.The caesar salad, was the best caesar I have had in my life.  If this was the only thing I had ordered i would have rated this place five stars and been done with it.  The skirt steak as a main was very good BUT it came with very little steak.  this was closer to a steak salad than a steak, the caramel sauce actually works.  the deep fat fried mashed potatoes could be so much better but they serve it with this sweet sauce which makes it almost like a jelly donut.  I wasn't a big fan.  For dessert I had the SMORE semifreddo, very good so good i didn't have time to take a pic.  Bring your kids here and enjoy your time eating diner food elevated to another level."
"Cute spot, good breakfast, great service. It was tough finding any good breakfast spots in Chicago since Seattle has such an abundance. The wait was pretty long on a Saturday morning."
"This place is a cute breakfast spot but it is so noisy! I felt like I had to scream out every time I had to say something. I came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was about a 10 minute wait. Not bad! There were a lot of people waiting too. Found this place on yelp and decided to try due to its highly rated reviews. I ordered the cheese grits, corned beef with eggs and bulls eye French toastCheese GritsI love grits! so all grits taste great to me. It was cheesy, loved the proportion of it since I ordered it as a side. The grits came with unmelted shredded cheese on top. I did think this was more dry than the grits I am use to having but it is still good.I was actually almost going to order the shrimp and grits which is a regular sized plate but I'm glad I didn't. I can't eat too much grits in one sitting Corned Beef with EggsI was done eating this after a few bites. The meat was just too smokey and it was pretty much a smokey taste throughout even though I ate it with the eggs and the shredded potatoes. I wasn't a big fan of this plate at all. It's pretty much a plate of meat. Too much meat for the morning and afternoon. I have to say that the potatoes were pretty good if u ate it alone.Bulls Eye French Toast This plate is the same concept as chicken and waffles--sweet and savory. The syrup is a must try because it was so different than regular syrup. I was trying to figure out what it was because it tasted so familiar! So it's pretty much bbq sauce and maple syrup! I was done with this plate after a few bites as well since the sweetness was good enough for mePriceI don't think the food was worth what it's priced at because the food was only decent, nothing extraordinaryNot sure if I'll come here again the next time I'm in Chicago"
"1 word, YUM! My friend and I waited for about 30-45 min on a Sunday at about noon (it wasn't a problem because we weren't starving and knew we would work up an appetite. We ordered the omelette of the day which was fresh tomato, green onion and tzatzki cream cheese, it was delicious!!! We also ordered the Bulls eye French toast (highly recommend), major party flavor in my mouth! I wanted to order a goat milk latte but I chickened out last minute and ended up with a regular latte, it was still delicious but it gives me a reason to go back and try the goat milk latte."
"If I can write one word for review for this place, it is ""creative"". If you read the menu, you won't know what kind of cuisine it is because each dish has some very random ingredients together. Like the quesadilla I ordered, there were chive, cheese and blueberries in it. I also sneak tasted some other dishes my colleagues order. I think the fish dish was the best of the night."
"We came here to hang out upstairs a couple days ago for a roof party. Sponsored by Founders and Bells, they were offering cans from those breweries along with a pre-mixed cocktail. We chose the cocktail which was a cherry limeade. It didn't taste too strong initially but it definitely had a little punch to it. It was super crowded upstairs and folks were just lurking around the chairs waiting for others to get up so they could snag their spots. It was also a million degrees so we enjoyed just our one drink and headed out. Having dined across the street at the Girl and the Goat a couple times, I really would love to--and am just looking for the right time to--come back here to try the grub. The roof is the place to be here in the summer!"
"Ommmmmmg Fat Elvis Waffles!  Two waffles topped  with peanut butter, bananas and maple bacon. So delish! I only wish they had put more peanut butter, one scoop for two waffles just isn't enough! Sugar exploooosion!This place was jam packed but I was seated quickly as a solo diner at the dining counter, where I got to be nosy and watch the service team. Speaking of service,  they were very friendly and efficient,  I was served rather quickly. I suppose the only problem I have with this place is the price...but it is in an expensive part of town and they do offer a higher caliber menu than your standard diner, so I get it. I'd return!"
"The food was yummy. We had the shrimp + grits, Cinnabun, and biscuits + gravy. Locally farmed food that's seasoned perfectly. Food was delicious and definitely recommend to my foodie friends. They take reservations as early as 7:00am. They aren't that busy early in the morning but if your waiting, you can kill time by taking pictures at their photo booth."
"We were not having the three-hour Au Cheval date. Do you know what place was amazing and seated us right away? Little Goat. This was my first time coming here, and I had high expectations having previously dined at Stephanie Izard's Girl and the Goat. We were seated at the bar and we ordered brussels sprouts as an appetizer while we perused the gigantic menu of equally delicious-looking options. Perhaps there was a misunderstanding or the brussels sprouts were actually a side because they ended up coming at the same time as the rest of the food. After lots of going back and forth, I finally decided to save the breakfast menu for a future Little Goat visit. I figured a burger would be a safe way to go, so I ordered one of the many options. I don't remember now which one it was, but it had a fried egg on the top. It was excellent. Not overly salty or overly anything. I would want to try something else next time, though. I was a bit disappointed by the brussels sprouts because they were very strong-tasting. I think it was some kind of oil or vinegar they were bathed in, but the taste was overwhelmingly salty. This is coming from someone who adds salt to things that were already salted, so you know I'm being serious when I say it was way too salty. The price was right for us, which was great (about $30 for both of our meals). As I've already mentioned a few times in this review, I do intend to come back to Little Goat to try more. I would be interested in trying one of the drinks as well as one of the drinks next time, too. We just couldn't possibly fit in any more on this particular visit. We were already back at the apartment and thinking about going to bed by the time we got the ""your table is now ready"" text from Au Cheval. Little Goat was an excellent alternative and I suggest you do the same if you're trying to get into another restaurant with a long wait. Little Goat is definitely a destination worth its own separate visit."
"Oh Little Goat, I do love you so.  Please give me all of your crab dip all of the time!I've been to Little Goat for brunch and I've also organized a private party.  Both experiences were great.  Brunch was crowded, even early, but they take brunch reservations so if you're able to do a little pre-planning, you should be good.  We all enjoyed everything we tried.  I kind of forgot everything everyone else got because my eyes were on the prize.  The prize being the bullseye french toast.  Imagine my surprise when I cut into that baby, forgetting that egg was on the description.  A hidden egg inside my french toast and fried chicken!  Awesome.  The coffee is great and the bloody mary was fine by me.  Fast forward to planning my work's holiday party.  That french toast was still on my mind, so I decided to blow some company money to satisfy my whims.  Working with the event staff was a breeze.  We had the sweet kitchen space to ourselves and were greeted with smiles and snacks.  I wanted to scoop the crab dip into my purse for later.  I'm like a tacky grandma in that way.  We tried a ton of family style menu items, the highlight of which was the goat leg.  If you're doing an event there, it is well worth adding.  Everything we tried was great and the cocktails were also fabulous.  Great food, friendly staff, a photobooth, and that patio will have me scheming more ways to plan another event here."
"My friends and I ended up here after arriving way too early for Girl & The Goat. And while I was disappointed in missing out on Girl & The Goat, the food here definitely made up for it.We tried:- Hot Crab Dip- Brandade and Belly- Los Drowned- Shrimp & PorkbellyThe Hot Crab Dip was probably my favorite. It was maybe a tad bit too salty though, especially with the ritz crackers. I felt like our other 3 dishes got a bit overwhelmed by the extra/side ingredients. Don't get me wrong, everything was delicious. But I felt like the flavor of the dishes' main component(s) wasn't as front and center as it could have been.The menu is cute but it leaves out some ingredients for certain dishes. (Ex: the Shrimp & Porkbelly has more veggies than just the pea shoots listed) While I appreciate the cleanness of the menu, I'm a somewhat picky eater so it would have been nice to know in advance what I was going to get.While Little Goat is technically a diner, it feels and looks just a bit more upscale than your usual diners. I loved the interior though. I also adored the design of the bathrooms. The employees were also nice and attentive."
"I love this place and think it's a perfect lunch spot! I tend to visit here when the wait at the surrounding restaurants are ridiculous and we're always seated within 10 minutes. The menu uses a lot of interesting/tantalizing flavor combos (I may be biased bc of my love for kimchi).The portions are generally just right and the price is not bad considering the quality of the food. My favorites are the SMOKED CORNED BEEF HASH WITH EGGS and KOREAN BURGER but I have yet to try everything (which I intend to)!The space is cool with its diner feel but I wish rooftop patio was open for regular diners (it's generally used for private parties). It would make the whole experience even better. Either way, I consider myself a regular here and always leave happy."
I have been to little goat 3 times (waiting for reservations at girl and the goat to arrive...). Luckily the space is super big because it's always busy.  Sometimes you can snag a seat at the bar.  But no worries. Go to the bakery and get some dope treats and some sludgy coffee.The food is great.  Kimchi tasted a little weird on the tasty Asian thing.  Don't order of you are in the conventional pancake mood.  Everything else I've had has been killer.  Always get the bread of the day.
"The Little Goat is like a diner in the sense that it has a huge, bright interior with a raucous and cheerful vibe.  It is like a diner in the sense that it seems to be home to everybody -- couples with kids, couples on double dates, older folks, and a pack of almost a dozen teenagers at a giant table together.  And it is also like a diner in that it has a giant menu, with both breakfast dishes and savory dishes served all day, and a dizzying organization that makes it hard to even decide what kind of meal you are eating.  (Cinnamon bun?  Cocktail?  Sandwich?  Salad?  Coffee?  Fried pickles?  All six at once?)It is unlike a diner in the sense that the food is intensely flavorful and really really good, from start to finish.  The coffee is dark and strong, the cocktails are well-balanced, the fried pickles are briny and crunchy, the cinnamon bun isn't too sweet, the salad is packed with both vegetables and more decadent treats, and putting kimchi in a reuben sandwich was an inspired idea.  (Yes, we did get all six at once.  It was one of those days.)And all of this was cheerfully and enthusiastically provided by a helpful server who helped us navigate the menu, finagled multiple substitutions in our order, and otherwise shattered all of the usual diner stereotypes.  After one visit, I already wish I went more often.  Indeed, I wish I lived next door."
"This place is such crowd pleaser. I've been here for breakfast, lunch and dinner and 90% of the time will resort to the Bullseye french toast. I am sucker for what I like. The rooftop is awesome (and the site of my ice bucket challenge). Some places big menus can be intimidating but with this one, you really can't go wrong!  (even though I order the bullseye-- i tend to mooch of other people's plates and I've liked everything they've had too!)"
"I suggest the hash browns.The hash browns were super skinny, and for lack of a better word, ""browned"" perfectly. Do not skip this!I had the cuban breakfast sandwich, which was the special of the day. I wasn't blown away by it, but it was pretty delicious. Enough so that I want to come back and try more items. There are a lot of options for breakfast, and time and care is put into preparing your meal, so everything looks fancy when it comes out. For that reason, it's a little pricey for a breakfast diner, so I think of this place as more of a special occasion breakfast than anything else.I was here super early in the morning...maybe around 7, and there were maybe 3 other people here (they did just open). More people started filing in later, so I don't know how crowded it gets around 10-12, but you're sure to have plenty of options to sit if you like to wake up early."
"The Girl and the Goat comes up on many foodies' lists for must visit restaurants in Chicago. Since I knew I would be dining solo, I thought their more casual sister restaurant, Little Goat, would be a better fit. I got sat at the last seat of the bar right next to the loud busing station. I was hoping for a better spot since I made reservations. It was a busy Sunday night though so there weren't many spots available.My waitress pointed out all the good vegetarian choices on the menu, and I realized I would be just as spoiled with choice as I had been at the veg restaurants I had already visited. After much internal debate, I went with the parathas burrito since it seemed like the least likely thing I could find at home.The burrito was indeed unique and tasty, especially with the kidney bean salad topping. The only thing that stopped it from being a ""wow"" dish was the overcooked eggs. I really wanted some runny yolks.Little Goat also has a nice cocktail menu. I started with their spicy coconut drink which was ok, but  my second drink, Eastwood's Ride, kicked major ass. It's their spin on a Moscow Mule. Usually I don't get excited about vodka drinks, but I would suggest seeking this one out. I was feeling pretty piggy after my meal and inquired about a to-go cookie, but they were already sold out. Maybe next time."
"Went  there for lunch today with my daughter. Very disappointing.  We ordered the crab dip appetizer which was very good but it was served with Ritz crackers which were too soft to stand up to the heaviness of the crab spread. I ordered the reuben sandwich - my mistake. Too much going on with the flavors; the pickled cabbage was awful and had large chunks in it. The bread was overly high fiber and had no moisture and had been grilled too long such that it was almost burned. Waitress was sweet but long wait for our food and again for our bill, which was $50 for lunch for two with no alcohol. Rediculous!"
"I have always enjoyed ""Girl & the Goat"" in Chicago so when I was in town, I visited the sister restaurant just across the street.  The Little Goat is more casual with a diner setup.  It's a great place for brunch with friends on a weekend.After scanning the menu, a few things caught my eye: Bull's Eye French Toast, the Brussels Sprouts with Almonds, and the Blenheim Spicy Gingerale!  (My friend got a salad.)The food is tasty and the portion is very generous.  I end up taking half of my french toast to go in the end.  I think Chef Izard has done a great job distinguishing The Little Goat from the Girl & the Goat while maintaining the quality of each dish.  If you love brussels sprouts, I would not hesitate to recommend her brussels sprouts!  (I only wish she would also offer her cauliflowers and green beans here!)"
"Been waiting to go here but was always nervous about the wait. We walked down ""early"" on Saturday at 10:30 and got a table for two in 10 minutes - amazing!The service is super friendly, menu is loaded and the space is buzzin'. We ordered the corned beef hash and the French toast to split... And a side of hash. It was a ton of food!!!! Everything was really delicious. We left stuuuuffed and satisfied!I had a couple mimosas that were very $$$$. They could cut back on that price a bit!Will be back. And hope it's not to bad!"
"Little Goat Diner gives you a true diner experience with gourmet food. I was totally blown away. When I arrived there was a huge crowd outside so I knew the waiting list was long. I didn't care, I was going to wait it out. Then when I told the hostess I was a lone diner, she informed if I didn't mind sitting at the counter, she could seat me immediately. Sometimes it pays to eat alone.Once I was seated, the two girls to my left were finished and leaving. I quickly chatted them up for recommendations and they said I had to experience the Brussels Sprouts. I shared with them my recent love affair with Brussels Sprouts and how I hated them as a child. They both confessed the same thing, so I knew I had to try them. I'm fan of Bloody Mary's, especially on a Sunday morning. However, I am also a big fan of a Moscow Mule. When I saw a Moscow Goat on their cocktail menu, I knew it was meant to be. Their Moscow Goat is Bombay Dry Gin, Ginger Beer and Grapefruit with lime garnish. Oh, so refreshing. If only we could start every morning with one of these.I had every intention of having breakfast, since they serve it all day. However, since it was nearly 1 PM and the girls had recommended the sprouts, I had to change to my lunch plan. I was going to try their Ruben, I wanted to add a new entry to my list here on Yelp.  Then as I was talking to my hispster waiter, I had a sudden piffany. I'm at the Little Goat DIner, so I should eat goat. I selected the Kilgus Goat Burger as my sandwich. For those of you have not tried goat before, don't be scared, give it a try. My burger was just as flavorful as any beef, lamb or bison burger. It was served on a Sesame Seed bun with the traditional burger garnishes. I had my pickle, onion, special sauce (what would a burger be without special sauce), lettuce and tomato. There was no need for ketchup or mustard, this burger was a winner just the way it was served. The Stir Fried Brussels Sprouts were a little too crunchy for me. and could have used a lttle more seasoning. Don't get me wrong, they were good, but my favorite sprouts are at The Pump Room. I can not wait for my next trip to Chicago, I'll be back at the Little Goat Diner for breakfast. I've gotta try those biscuits and gravy."
"Interesting place in West Loop that mixes Asian flavors with classic Southern feel.  Everything here is a mixture of excellent flavors and flavors.I ordered the Tonkatsu sandwich, which was a double deck sandwich filled with two huge slabs of fried pork, cheese, and sauerkraut.  The sandwich was so good I had to purposely save half of it for later because future me would love it even more as a late night snack.Everyone in Chicago needs to come here at least once a month."
"Ehhhh. I used to love Little Goat, but it's become so over-hyped. A 45 minute wait for lunch? Nuts. Especially when there are so many other great options nearby. It's so loud in here, service is horribly patchy, and it's really just become a tourist trap. I miss how chill this place used to be!"
The wait was long and the young woman who did the seating was rude and disinterested. It was obvious to my party that she was seating other people first. Finally one of us asked why the people who just arrived were seated before us. She stuttered and said we were next trying to look surprised. It was not a good beginning. The food was good and plentiful. The server was good. But the people at the front of the house were sufficiently nasty that I'm not sure if we will return.
"Such a cute place in the west loop. Their brunch is next level, and their upstairs event space is super cute and chic. Parking nearby is classically terrible, but worth the trek."
"I've been here so many times in the last year cuz it's hands down one of the best restaurants in the city. I've had mostly everything on the menu, but the best dish is the Parathas Burrito. I promise you won't be disappointed.That bring said, all the food is phenomenal. Service is impeccable and the atmosphere is perfect. No bad things to say.Oh, and wait times are usually pretty reasonable. Reservations are always a good idea though."
"Had the club sandwich. Very good and well made. Ingredients were fresh, place is clean and nice lunch crowd. Service was good, no complaints. Also had the ""spicy "" ginger ale. Pretty good."
We loved the atmosphere and the concept at Little Goat when double dating here last night. The bright but dim simple decor is very calming and relaxing. We stopped at the bar while waiting for our table and enjoyed the chance to try a few specialty cocktails.For our meals we decided to share an entree and a salad between the two of us. My husband picked the Shrimp and Pork Belly entree and I tried the GoatoGoato salad. The salad was big and ingredients nice and crunchy fresh. I tasted mint and fennel although the server described the dressing as being an Asian flavor. I couldn't find any cheese but had hoped with the name there may be some goat cheese (?) or cream.The Shrimp and Pork Belly entree was served over noodles and was the fan favorite at the table! We agreed with the server's recommendation for this dish. For dessert we tried a banana cake with a layer of bacon and peanut butter frosting. I was skeptical of whether a dessert could be truly heavenly without chocolate but alas it is true! I could have died and gone to heaven if eating this for breakfast. I think it'd be a great addition to a brunch menu as well.
"I knew full well that I was going to be waiting a while to get brunch here on a Sunday. That was my own damn fault. After the two hour wait, I was worried that the wait wouldn't be worth it, but I was wrong. The portions were not huge, but to me that was a good thing as I didn't feel so wasteful. It was the perfect amount to fill you up, especially with a delicious Bloody Mary. I can't wait to go back- I do wish they did reservations for brunch, though."
"Amazing hipster gastropub spot. Seriously great food, great cocktails, great ambience, and priced well. They have a lot of neat stuff on the menu, a lot of pork belly, and goat dishes, as well as some fun interpretations on comfort food as well as breakfast. You need to check this place out!Quick recommendations: (we had dinner here)Smoke and a Pancake  (cocktail. .. whiskey)Nachos ( great for sharing)Shrimp and pork belly noodles (entrée )Lamb ribs (entrée)Mac n Cheese (side)Toffee and bacon milkshake ( yes... trust me. ... pair it with a shot of whiskey... pour it right into the shake  )"
"I decided to come here for a drink and small appetizer before heading over to AU CHEVAL for dinner.I wanted something light so I ordered the shrimp cocktail and a glass of wine.Service was very friendly and nice.Most dishes served here are breakfast and huge servings.Wine was served in a Drinking glass which was odd.Anyway , I prefer the BIG GOAT across the street vs this joint."
"What to say that hasn't already been said? This place is great. The décor is diner chic with some industrial lighting touches. When you walk in, you are faced with the dining room. Open and inviting, it has lots of booth seating, as a diner should. We had to wait for a table. So we headed to the bar for cocktails. I had the Mickey Blue Eyes. So yummy! Refreshing but not overly sweet. When we sat to eat ,we met our waitress. The lovely Camille, who was super sweet and knew the menu inside and out. We started with the Nachos. Lovely but super filling. The chips themselves are house made. They look deceptively light because some are puffed from the frying. The toppings were great. In truth, it could have used something spicy to liven it up. I ordered the Pork Cutlet Sandwich. Yes, sir! The pork was thin and perfectly breaded and fried. It was a divine pork cutlet. It was served on house made white bread. According to the waitress, I should have delighted in the texture difference between the crispy pork and soft white bread. I didn't think the white bread held up well with the hot pork. Just my opinion for what it's worth. That said, I'd order if again. The pork was the bomb. We also ordered fries that we totally didn't need. They were seasoned with a house made seasoning (are you seeing the theme of fresh and house made? loved it!). It gave the fries an awesome smoky flavor."
"I may be being a little harsh on this place because of just how much it seems like it's trying to skate by on the reputation of the nearby and affiliated Girl and the Goat. This place is good, fine, whatever -- but if you've made it this far, save your money, make the leap, and get a reservation for dinner at the Girl and the Goat across the street.I came here for lunch, and there is a solid diner feel. The place is well lit, the menu has lots of good options, and it seems like it could even be a good breakfast/brunch option -- in which case, by all means, come here; I don't think that G&G has an early option.But, honestly, the food wasn't all that interesting, just good. The prices were a little higher than I thought they should be, probably because of the brand and affiliation. ($10 for a grilled cheese? $13 for a sandwich?) And so I really wouldn't come back.But, it's a fine option for lunch if you're in the neighborhood."
"The service left a lot to be desired. The server was very nice, but inattentive. The place was packed, so this can be forgiven. We had to ask for glasses and plates multiple times, and both took about 20 minutes.The food was awesome, and we will be back, because at the end of the day it's about the food. If you love mashed potatoes, try the mashed potato tempura. The best thing we had was the crab appetizer. My friends and I were fighting over it, and if you're interested I believe the exact recipe is online. Either way, you have to try it here.The bullseye French toast was flavorful and something different from your run of the mill French toast. The cheese grits were some of the best I've had. The macaroni and cheese was nice and creamy, just like it should be. The cookies were fresh and a nice snack after a filling lunch. There are so many menu options that you have to come here multiple times to try everything you would want to try."
I really didn't like this this place as much as I thought I would. I understand there's a fusion going on but wasn't to my satisfaction. I had the porkbelly pancake and there was too much flavors going on and i didn't really like it. It kind of felt like I was eating more of a salad than a pancake so I was pretty disappointed. We also got breakfast tacos to share and it was really unique since there was eggs in it and that tasted a lot better than the porkbelly pancake. My friend had the Korean burger and it was pretty good just really messy to eat so be careful.
"Couldn't get reservations for the Girl and the Goat so my friends and I tried the next best thing. We got reservations and still had to wait about 15 minutes, which is understandable given the popularity of Little Goat. We ordered the Bulls Eye French toast that came with fried chicken and strawberries. This was by far my favorite dish. The French toast had more egg content than normal French toast, but it worked and I really liked it. The fried chicken and strawberries and syrup perfectly complemented the French toast. SO GOOD. Definitely hit the bull's eye on this one.We also ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles. The peanut butter-butter was delicious, but I felt like there was not enough of it! Maybe because it was so good.... The dish also had bananas which went well with the waffles. Overall a good dish, but more peanut butter-butter please!In addition, we ordered two sides. Mac n Cheese and the Cheesy grits. The Mac n Cheese was really good! The Cheesy grits were just average and nothing really special. Wow, Chicago has such good restaurants and this is definitely one of them! I look forward to coming back when I visit Chicago again!"
"Went here this evening with my husband and his work team. Everyone seemed to really enjoy everything that was ordered! I had a Moscow Goat, which as you might guess, is a Moscow mule, to drink. Drink was pretty ok, but served in a glass instead of a traditional copper mug, which didn't matter in the least, just something I noticed. My husband had a scotch with maple syrup, which he really liked. For the main dish I ordered the (can't remember the exact name) Indian bread filled with two eggs over easy, topped with a bean salad, and a side of breaded mashed potatoes topped with Asian slaw. Very yummy!! The Indian bread (not naan) was drizzled with some type of sauce which was super delicious and paired well with the egg. The atmosphere is a slightly dressier version of a diner. The service was decent and our waitress was very accommodating. She even asked if anyone in our party had any food allergies after we placed our order which I thought was a very conscientious move on the part of the restaurant. Good dining experience and would definitely make the drive to visit again some time!"
"1. VERDICT/VALUE: It's a diner done well - With an eclectic choice of breakfast, burgers/sandwiches, entrees, and desserts, the Little Goat goes big in providing great tastes at reasonable prices!2. FOOD: on this visit, it was breakfast for dinner with the Bull's Eye French Toast.  Egg-washed Texas toast, served with an egg over-easy, smothered with melted cheese, strawberries, chopped chicken tonkatsu (think deep fried chicken breast meat) and maple syrup.  Yum - if only they served it with a third piece of French toast!A nibble of a friend's Shrimp and Cheesy Grits revealed plump shrimp bites with creamy yet al dente grits.  A delight to try whole during the next visit!3. SERVICE: Despite the busy-ness of the packed restaurant, it was always prompt, attentive, and professional - full stars here, especially when they accommodated a friend's surprise birthday well with a candle-lit dessert!4. ATMOSPHERE: It's a diner - old-school meets clean and swanky under classic lights and it has a fun photo booth at the entrance to boot.  The dressed-up can look towards the affiliated Girl and the Goat across the street while the Little Goat provides great times and great food in a casual environment."
"Everything we tried was excellent!!!!! Even my daughter's burger and fries from the kid's meal was on another level!!!!!!! Our server Andrea, was very attentive and kind to us. I will definitely be back!!!"
"My husband and I came here on a Wednesday evening to celebrate my birthday. It was just the two of us and we were able to get a table (with his reservation). This is a cute diner - I love the atmosphere - it's your modern-day diner. Our waitress was very nice, too. We started with the hot crab dip and side of mac and cheese. The hot crab dip is cute - it comes with Ritz crackers.. lots of CHEESE and possibly little crab? It was pretty hearty but delicious. The mac and cheese was good. For entree I had the Little Pig who Went to China. I really like the cheddar biscuit but I did not like the pork sausage that came with it. It comes with two eggs in the middle which was delish.. came with blackberries which was more decor to me than taste. My husband ordered the bulls eye french toast. His dish was very heavy! They have eggs inside the french toast that's loaded with lots of syrup. It was definitely a fusion dish - but he could only finish half of it. He likes it, but just felt very guilty after eating it. Our tab ended up  being around $66.. I would come back and try something else. The dishes with the kimchi (not the kimchi pancake) really interests me!"
"For all the hype about this place, it was quite a disappointment. For starters I was most excited for the hot crab dip with ritz crackers. It was really heavy and cheesy. I could barely taste the crab flavor. It was overwhelmingly rich and the ritz crackers did not help to balance the richness. For my meal I ordered the fried chicken. I was expecting a fried chicken like from KFC but way better. Nope I got a weird deep fried chicken. I've had chicken from roscoes and like how they make it so I was not happy with my chicken. I will say that it was moist but it was much too flaky. My fiancé ordered the shrimp and pork belly noodles. That has way too much salt and the shrimp was over cooked. His brother ordered the ravioli and he was satisfied with his order. Maybe I should have ordered that...What saved this place from a 1 star was the ooey gooey cinnamon bun. It was so delicious and just melted in my mouth. The bread was so soft and fluffy. I loved it and ate it before my main meal came out. I left with an uneasy stomach. It was much too heavy for my taste. Sadly to say I will not be coming back to this restaurant. Farewell little goat."
"This is a great option on Randolph street that's more on the casual side. If you're currently exploring Yelp for your pre-Bulls or pre-Blackhawks game spot, this is definitely it. They have great starters and even better sandwiches and burgers...and since you can't count on getting into Au Cheval before the big game and this place takes reservations, this is probably the right move.My favorite to start with is the crab dip, it's delicious but very filling. If going with two people I'd get this and split a sandwich! The best sandwich is probably the Los Drowned and all of the burgers I've tried are delicious!This is the sister restaurant to Girl and the Goat which is much more upscale and much harder to get a reservation at. Definitely try this place out, worth checking out for brunch too."
"Love the casual diner feel, if only it didn't come with a 2 hour wait. But alas the wait was worth it and the food was delicious. We split a blueberry pie milkshake which tasted exactly how it sounds and was incredible. I had the spring quesadilla with asparagus, goat cheese and BLUEBERRIES! Yeah blueberries in a quesadilla. It was borderline genius and so fresh, springy and delicious. Our service was excellent. Can't wait to come back."
"We had a reservation on a Saturday night, but we still had to wait about ten minutes once we arrived. We were seated in a giant booth, which I must say I loved because it's so nice to have enough space and not feel cramped when eating out. We ordered a couple beers and a glass of wine. I couldn't decide if I wanted to order breakfast or dinner and decided to go for dinner. We asked for some recommendations on the food and our server did not disappoint. We tried the Reuben, party melt with a goat patty and the Korean burger with a goat patty. We also ordered a side of mac and cheese.  Everything tasted good, but I think the prices are a little high for what you get. I did like the atmosphere a lot. I think on my next visit I will definitely go for the breakfast portion of the menu."
"Ate here as my last meal after living in Chicago for 3 years.  I was not disappointed by the food one bit.  I had the goat chili, fried onion rings / pickles, and the fish tostadas.  My wife had the American burger.  All were delicious.  My only qualm -- which is also why I didn't give 5 stars -- is that my ""From Peru With Love"" (essentially a Pisco Sour) was a bit bland and weak.  It wasn't something I expected for $12."
"I am not entirely sure what everyone loves about this place. We went for lunch with a friend in from out of town. We had a cocktail at the bar, then got a table quickly, and service was perfectly pleasant at both. I would say if I were just rating service I would give it 4 stars. The food, however, was disappointing. The crab dip was basically just cheese sauce with a bit of crab and ritz crackers. Really? Ritz crackers? You have a whole bakery on premise...So we order lunch. My tuna melt was so saucy that the bread was mush. My friends' food was equally unimpressive. Our friend who was in town visiting was sorely disappointed. We had a $50/person diner meal that really was no better than the corner diner in my neighborhood where our meal would have been less than half the price."
"I loved Little Goat because the atmosphere was both casual and elegant, fun and intimate. The decor and food was familiar and unique, like an ordinary person could enjoy without feeling like he or she didn't belong. I came with two friends and we each ordered something different: one app, one burger, and one breakfast. The food was top notch. I got the Korean burger and my friend got the pork belly and we both commented how the Asian inspired dishes were both great. Neither my burger nor my friend's pancakes came with sides, so if I went back I would splurge on a side to share. Other than that, the price is a lot more affordable compared to Girl and the Goat but you really aren't sacrificing much in terms of taste. Can't wait to try the other unique dishes!"
"I've gone to Girl & The Goat every time I've been in Chicago, so we thought it was time we gave the Little Goat a fair shot. We came here for brunch on a weekday and were seated right away. The diner is really cute and I love the big open space. We ordered the bull's eye french toast, fish tostadas and side of hash browns to share. The bull's eye french toast was similar to a regular type of chicken and waffles dish.. but there was a surprise factor. Towards the center of each french toast, there was a whole egg -- yolk and all! At first, I was pleasantly surprised by this.. but the more bites I took, the more I didn't like the consistency of the french toast with the egg. The crispy chicken, strawberry slices and maple syrup were great though. The fish tostadas was a last minute call and boy am I glad we ordered it. Someone walking by our table even asked what it was because it looked so delectable. It came with whitefish and a wonderful chickpeas onion salad all overloaded on a crispy tostada. There were 3 tostadas and we only were able to finish 2. Each bite left me wanting more, but what I liked most is that the dish was light and didn't leave me feeling weighed down. The chickpeas onion salad with the vinaigrette was my favorite part! There were so many items on the menu that sounded amazing, but that only means we'll be back! I'm surprised they're open all day, but that's an added bonus for their patrons."
"I was so glad I decided to go try Little Goat though this place was a half an hour away when deciding where to get lunch...!Well, I got to try only two items from the menu, but I am a fan!!My boyfriend and I shared... ""This Little piggy went to China""($13) and ""Pork belly pancake""($13), and we loved both!""This little piggy..."" had sunny eggs and pork sausage with chili garlic chive sauce and blackberries on a sesame cheddar biscuit!!! So happy this little piggy went to China cuz it was so flavorful!! I did think this one was a little too salty though. Sunny eggs york made it's saltiness milder, yet it could be less salty so I didn't have to get so thirsty after lunch.""Pork belly pancake"" was pork belly and bok choy salad with ginger maple dressing on scallion pancake, and this was very good too. Just try Little Goat if you have a chance with an open mind and enjoy the Chef's creation. It made me wanna make some unique dishes at home. Isn't it nice to find an inspiring places?! Next time I visit Chicago, I wanna try Girl & the Goat!"
"This is really elevated diner food.  Casual, retro setting, with mid-century feel.  There is an attention to detail that is relaxing and smile-inducing.  Service is friendly and the coffee is good.  We came for breakfast and were informed that the entire menu, breakfast-lunch-dinner, is available.  Cocktails too - a really nice selection of craft cocktails - alas, it was just too early on a Sunday morning for that.Anyhow, this is really a paean to diner food - pancakes, waffles, eggs, bacon, burgers, sandwiches, potatoes, bread - all familiar stuff - but most items feature at least one unique twist.  For example, the burgers include your choice of patty - beef of course, but there is also goat and veggie.  The goat patty is really good - mildly gamey but well prepared - crispy caramelized on the outside but the inside was a bit dry.The goat patty Korean burger is delicious but difficult to eat - a goat patty topped with kimchi, braised bok choy, bacon, spicy mayo, served on a fluffy sweet bun.  The blue plate special today was salmon bruschetta - this was also delicious but difficult to eat - tender chunks of salmon on clam-baguette with blueberries and grape tomatoes.  Goat patty loco moco was interesting as well - this was served with fried rice, roasted tomatoes, braised bok choy and a sweet and sour sauce.  It was tasty but somewhat heavy-handed with the sweet and sour sauce.Our lone sweet item of the morning was the Elvis waffle - Belgian style waffles with banana and peanut butter.  Also quite delicious.This place serves fresh baked breads from their bakery next door and OMG the breads are good.  The Korean goat burger bun was brioche-like, fluffy, soft, subtly sweet and perfectly toasted.  The clam baguette that was served with the bruschetta was pleasantly ... uh... clammy.  The special bread of the day was a spicy miso bread that was simply magnificent - how do they get that bread so soft on the inside yet full of texture?The menu is huge so there's so much to try.  Definitely worth more visits!"
"I don't think I'd go here for dinner, but GREAT for a Sunday meal.  Definitely a menu that everyone will love.  I took my younger brother (college age), my mom, aunt and grandmother here and there, and there wasn't one person who wasn't happy with their meal.   Much like Girl and the Goat, I think the best way to experience the menu is to share everything so you get to order, and try, more.The great thing about LG is that while waiting for your table (and there will almost certainly be a wait), you can hit up their bar next door and they'll call you when ready.Unfortunately, my brussel sprouts weren't as good as the ones I've had a Girl and the Goat, but they were still not bad by any means.  The ravioli is superb, if you have taste buds, then you don't want to miss it."
"Confession: I'm a big fan of all things Steph Izzard and Alex Bachman, but that's only because they nail it EVERY time. Little Goat is no exception. We'd been trying to get here for a long time and the right time presented itself today... FINALLY. She set out to bring her take on a diner and she nailed it. The menu is bigger than her menus usually are (typical for diners), has typical diner fare done remarkably well (including milkshakes and sandwiches), and is the right price point for the food and neighborhood. We got the bread of the day to start which was spot-on. Then I had the killer tuna melt... so very nom nom nom. We also got the mac n cheese which was a great side to share for 3-4 people.We stopped by the bread shop after lunch to grab and tea to wash it all down. (They have Stumptown coffee, fyi.) Their chai was BANGIN!! It was super spicy... I think it had chile powder in it, maybe?? If you like spicy chai, get it. It's bomb.K, now to the gym to work off my tuna melt and mac n cheese!! Such hard work, but totally worth it!! Now, to have an excuse to get down to A10 in Hyde Park..."
"This place is ridiculous. The food is weak and ill conceived , the service is terrible."
"The corned beef and hash breakfast was my favorite I've tried out of 5 states across the country. Hash browns were stringy and delicious with the combination of onion and over medium eggs, to die for. Must have every time I visit Chicago.."
"Really, really great experience! We arrived 30 minutes before close and received extraordinary service. Food was amazing!! The French Toast is a must!!! It comes with an egg in the middle and fried chicken on top, what! The strawberry syrup/reduction was a perfect compliment.My kids had Mac and cheese and grilled cheese. The hubby had a burger and fries with goat chili. This spot is legit!Mentioned 30 minutes before close as they were cleaning up around us, not in a way that was like 'hurry up and get out' but they were going above and beyond in how they cleaned. I used to work in restaurants back in the day and you can tell by what occurs at clean up if management cares...this management cares!"
"My friend and I were showing our two friends from out of state around Chicago and we picked this place for dinner. Valet parking around this area is $12 for the first 4 hours. Or, if you are feeling lucky, you can try to find street parking, I think it was $4/hour, 2 hours max.We went for an early dinner on Friday so finding street parking wasn't too bad if you don't mind walking for about five minutes.We got seated right away when we arrived around 5 PM but when we finished eating and left around 7 PM, we noticed there was a group of people waiting to be seated so if you want to beat the crowd, come before 7 or make reservations!I ordered the Reuben sandwich since I have never had a Reuben before and wanted to give it a try. The corned beef was good but I don't really like the kimchi and kraut that was also in the sandwich. It made it very sour and tangy. It was a good portion for a sandwich, I was pretty full after eating half of the sandwich. I also got to try a bite of my friend's Los Drowned and I definitely liked that one more. It had more flavor and I enjoyed the braised beef that it had. This sandwich did get soggy pretty fast so you should eat fast with this one if you don't like soggy sandwiches.My other friend ordered the breakfast spaghetti w/ clams & crab and he said it was horrible. He did not enjoy his meal at all. And from the looks of it, it did not look appealing at all.Overall, service was great but the food, not so much. Total came out to about $80 for 4 people with food and drinks. Note, Little Goat Diner is a less upscale version of Girl & Goat. I believe they have the same chef."
"This might be my new favourite place to eat in the city. I loved absolutely everything... EVERYTHING! The decor, the music, the waitstaff and dear God, the FOOD.Husband and I made it a point to split a bunch of plates so we could get the ""full experience"" (or at least the closest thing to it). Going by a bunch of Yelp reviews (A.B.Y. - Always Be Yelping), I navigated the menu and chose what sounded the best to us but also were crowd favourites. Here's the breakdown:Smoked Pork & Toffee shake: I was expecting little pieces of bacon in it, but I was pleasantly surprised that they used pork fat gelato and added chocolate/toffee to it. Amazing. I asked for some bourbon added because fuck it, that's why.Moscow Goat: mixed drink; tasted like a key lime pieHot Crab Dip: served with Ritz crackers. It's VERY rich. Like almost too rich, I was pretty much almost full before our food arrived. Save a little bit to dip your fries in later.Bullseye French Toast: awesome brioche with an egg in the middle, covered in savoury maple syrup, chicken tenders, and strawberries. Literally the best FT we've ever had. It's such a nice change of pace from the borderline-bread pudding/diabeetus loaves we're used to.Tempura Mashed Potatoes: squares of mashers fried in tempura batter, served with some Asian slaw and ranch/bbq sauce. Pretty amazing for something that's just pure starch. The aforementioned crab dip tastes awesome with these.Choco Taco: sour cream gelato, chocolate dipped tortilla chips, candied pepitas, homemade magic shell and goat milk caramel sauce. HOLY SHIT. I can't even. You just have to try it.I can't wait to go back here and try everything else they have. This little goat has trotted his way into my heart. My bacon-and-starch-filled heart."
So incredibly disappointed. Have been wanting to try this place for so long. Service could not have been worse. So very rude!  Other tables were having to get their own silverware. We had to go in and order our own drinks. The waitress was not even mortified that customers were having to serve themselves.  Came here for a celebration lunch.  Leaving now to find somewhere else with better service for cocktails and dessert.  Expected so much more from this place. The one star is given for the bartenders who were wonderfully helpful!!!!!!  The food was all good but heavy on the creamy sauces.
"Had the goat chili cheese fries, the sloppy goat and the goat burger (korean).All were delicious but the Girl & the Goat is much better!!!!I wouldn't go back because it's very rich food, but it was a great place to eat at as it is those ""once in a while"" spots or somewhere tourists go.  Quality of the food was clearly very fresh.Servers were slow and really unfriendly.  I was surprised.  Our server took ages to greet us, over 20 minutes.  I'm not dying to go back, but I would go to try some of the other menu items that piqued my interest and tastebuds."
"I've just eaten the most bizarre and delicious breakfast in my life. The Little Goat's menu has an ""Asian Thingey."" The dish is a stack of pancakes, eggs, bacon, and kim chi. There are some mung beans on top and a small shot of fish sauce on the side. The whole thing works. Delicious. The Asian Thingey is not a dish for the traditionalist. If you're looking for an American style breakfast, this is not your dish. The dish is going to ask you to short circuit your expectations for ""brunch"" and experience it on its own terms. There is bravery by the kitchen for putting an outlier like this on the menu. Little Goat is a classy, upscale-ish diner and bakery. The food is really lovely. For the bakery, they have classics (croissants, muffins, etcs.) and a rotating menu of other goodies. Standouts of the seasonal offerings were the Apricot Masala scones and squash muffins. On the dessert menu, the apple and fennel pie was a wonderful variation on the American classic. Wonderful diner execution with some real invention happening in the kitchen. Plenty of good stuff for the ""normal brunch set"" with enough wild stuff for the adventurous."
Got the mo heat-o. Was not a big fan. It was a little spicy. Got the quesadilla which was very good! The ambience is nice but it is loud inside so not the best place to go to talk. Definitely want to go back and check the shakes and other food out. They did not have any cake for dessert so that was disappointing.
"I don't really get all the rave reviews. If you're looking for good diner food at an affordable price, go elsewhere. First of all, our server let us look at our menus for maybe 5-7 minutes and then came to our table and said something to the tune of, ""okay, time to go."" Didn't ask us if we were ready and seemed to want to rush us, which isn't what you want to feel in a diner. I got the blueberry pancakes. They were okay, but nothing worth $12, especially with no included sides. Meh."
"Had one of the best breakfasts I've had in my life here; ordered the Pork Belly Pancake and Smoked Corned Beef Hash with eggs.  Order these two dishes and you cannot go wrong.  Woke up my taste buds and got them ready for another day of Chicago food exploration, though every next restaurant now had a lot to live up to.  To avoid a wait at the busy diner, you can sit at the bar to the right, which was pretty much empty when we arrived.  Our bartender gave us great, on demand service.  This was a great spot to top off dinner the previous night at Girl and the Goat."
"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and had the opportunity to do so after Yelp's 10th anniversary party.My friend and I had a 30 minute wait which wasn't that bad for a weekday in the summer. We sat outside on a bench talking and before we knew it we were getting called to come be seated. Since it was such a nice night we elected to sit outside. Our server was awesome (I wish I could recall his name). He was funny, personable, gave me a detail rundown of the menu and even gave me a milkshake on him as a treat for this being my first time there. I love milkshakes and I love them more when they are FREE.For my meal I had the Bull's Eye French Toast and it was DELICIOUS! The egg and crispy chicken inside the French Toast was magical. This dish is sweet so if your teeth are on their last legs you may not want to order this dish.There are so many other dishes on the menu that I want to try so I will for sure be going back to Little Goat!"
"Just finished having dinner here with my dad. I ordered the Reuben and it did not disappoint. I liked Izard's twist and loved literally everything about the sandwich. I will definitely be back the next time I have a Reuben craving. Even if I have to drag myself all the way to the West Loop. Server was also nice and attentive with helpful suggestions. The space is very cute and my dad was impressed by the attention to detail (creative bill/credit card holders). No fifth star because the soda is stupid overpriced. Seriously. And because we ordered the fried pickles and onion rings and they were just yuck. If you like sweet fried pickles and onions, then maybe this would be your jam, but every fried pickle and onion ring I've had is savory. The hunt for solid fried pickles continues..."
Amazing food!! Highly recommend getting a bloody mary here they make it with Kimchi and it's one of the best ones I've every had.
"Great service, awesome drinks, great food.I have been here a few times and have ordered off of every section of the menu and it's great!  The plate description is precise and if you're lost, their wait staff is more than educated on what is being served.  Their service is on point as well.  From the hosts, to the wait staff, to the bus boys, to the chefs.  One time sat at the bar in front of the kitchen (damn hot by the way), and the chef was laughing at my friend's and I jokes.  Very personable people that make your dining experience better.Coming back here for sure!"
"My friend and I were advised to come to Little Goat as the cheaper option to The Girl and The Goat. When we headed over on a Wednesday night, we figured it wouldn't be busy- were we wrong! We got thankfully got straight in, as we were willing to sit at the bar, but I would have waited days for the meal we had. We split the blue-plate special scallops and fried chicken, and had the shanghai strawberry surprise ice cream dessert. The scallops, although pricey ($23 for 6), were amazing, and the fried chicken was the best I've ever had. The strawberry dessert, though, is something that I will travel back to Chicago for. Szechuan strawberry and sesame oil gelato with candied sesame seeds- to die for. I wanted to simultaneously not eat it (to save it) and eat it (to experience the sublime tastes). I would highly recommend!"
Little Goat is the diner and less upscale version of Girl & the Goat. This place is amazing and you don't need to make a 3 month reservation.If you don't have reservation you will wait for a little over an hour. Its so worth it though! Must try:1. Pork belly on scallion pancake with asian slaw 2. Bulls eye french toast.3. Biscuits and gravy (AMAZING)4. Crab dip. 5. All their sandwiches. I suggest coming here with someone and splitting the foodnto order more.My friend and I got lucky and we sat at the communal table. The staff gave us so many food to sample on and they were all delicious.
"Who knew something so simple can be made so good...? Originally, I had really wanted to try Girl and Goat. However, the reservations were all booked until next month and I am not going to wait 2 hours for dinner. Thankfully, I was able to make a reservation across the street!  I had the Los Drowned and my boyfriend the Fat Club, which to me was nothing special. I definitely recommend the Los Drowned!! Wow, what a blast of flavor! The bread was so soft and they do not drench it with the sauce given. Instead it's on the side so you have the choice to ""drown"" it if you'd like!The service was so-so.. the hostess and waiters could have at least tried to look happier.."
"Came here for breakfast and walked out feeling that this is another really great addition to the breakfast scene in Chicago.Food: We had the french toast, the loco moco, and a cinnamon bun and all were pretty excellent. Portions are large. Coffee: Features Stumptown beans. Ambiance: High ceilings, open lighting all throughout - especially in the daytime, an open kitchen, and plenty of seating. It's a modern diner feel, so it's nice but still has a casual feel.Overall, it has a pretty creative menu as far as meats featured go, and it's worth checking out."
"I was raised in a farm town, but a love for farm animals, I have not. That is, until my love of ""Little Goat"" came to be. With over a thousand reviews under their belt (er collar?) what can I say that hasn't already been said? Likely, absolutely nothing! But they are owed my 5-stars and I shall pay up. I have a love/hate relationship with pancakes. --I HATE bad ones and I LOVE good ones. Rules for pancakes: Don't make them from a mix. Do let the batter rest before you pour it onto a griddle. --gotta relax the gluten after all of that mixing. :) And  DO make them with buttermilk. If you follow those rules, you win. If you don't, I'll know and I'll be severely disappointed.  The Chocolate Crunch pancakes with the chocolate butter was love at first bite. Perfect texture, perfect lightness, and perfect flavor. They not only followed the pancake commandments, they exceeded them. I mean, chocolate butter on the side?! Good heavens, that will go straight to my backside and I don't even care! ""Los Drowned"" --their take on a French Dip. The braised beef (tender) with the havarti cheese and the pickled peppers and onions (yum, yum and yum).... Easily one of the best I've ever had. It's messy. It will require napkins. It will drip down your chin. Maybe even your arms. But, you will love every single bite. Fish Tostada -- Three crispy tostadas, piled HIGH with lightly battered whitefish, shallot aioli, avocados, chickpeas and a harissa vinaigrette. I've ordered this a couple of times and each time I've thought I'm the luckiest one at our table. Fried Pickles and Onions --they're good on their own (light batter and piled high), but the curry dip makes them impossible to stop eating. Especially, if you're lucky enough to find your plate with an onion ring and a pickle fried together and getting intimately acquainted. --It's like when you find three tortilla chips folded and fried together in a chip basket. --you smugly snatch it before anyone else at your table can.I actually tried the Smoked Pork and Toffee Shake. First slurp --""Oh, my! My ice cream tastes like MEAT!"" Second slurp ""Hmm....chocolate too. Do I like this?"" Third slurp ""Yeah, I think I kind of do."" It's original. It's different. If people can eat maple doughnuts with bacon, why can't there be a smoked pork and chocolate shake too? It's the salty/sweet combo that we all like. There's a chance I'd order it again, but it wouldn't be a regular thing. After all, it's still a shake that tastes like meat. I won't always be in the mood for that. Worth a try though. Life is a competition and how many of your friends can say they've tried that? :PLast of all, service. I made a res using Open Table and then got stuck in bad traffic. I called them and asked to move my reservation by 30 minutes. They graciously told me that they'd hold my table until I got there. I showed up 30 minutes late on a Saturday and my table sat empty when I arrived. Granted, it was 5 pm on a Sat. --before the huge rush. But, still. That is some good service!Come to Little Goat. There's a reason they have an average of 4 stars with over 1300 reviews. :)"
Andrea took good care of is! Order came out right away - we ordered a variety of different items so we could share and taste more!! Everything was absolutely delicious. It's a lively place so if you are looking for a quiet spot to have a conversation probably not the place - but we loved it!
"Pretty disappointing especially given the hype around this place. Food was average, and there was a French fry in one of our party's gluten free salads. She has Celiac's disease, so it pretty much ruined her night even though she cleared it with the server before hand."
"I visited Chicago for a couple of days during the 4th of July and had the opportunity to walk around, explore, and eat a lot of amazing food and Little Goat was no exception.I had the pork belly pancake.  The pancake is asian influenced, so it was savory and had scallions in it which added another layer of flavor.  The dish itself almost looked like an over sized taco.  The pork belly was amazing and honestly one of the best things I ate in Chicago.  However, the portion of pork belly available was small and for an entree that featured pork belly, I would expect it to be more present on the dish.  The diner itself was extremely busy and took my friend and I about an hour to get seated.  Service was also slow as the place was packed; took another 30 minutes or so to get out appetizers and entrees."
"First time here. My coworker wanted to try the fried chicken. He raved about it and was not disappointed one bit! I had the braised beef samich and it was very tasty. The beef was very tender and plentiful. I couldn't finish the sandwich.Although I don't think I will return, I had a great meal and would recommend this restaurant."
"Fantastic diner. We had blue berry pancakes, veggie quesadilla, club and omelette. All were excellent choices. Only drawback here is the noise level. It's very very loud."
"This review is for the 2nd floor private dining. This was such an amazing experience! Even tho it was for work, I had a great time. I mean, I probably wouldn't have been (or will not ever in the future be) able to experience this again, since it's for a larger group. And it's kind of expensive..Anyway. The chef from Girl and the Goat prepares each dish here in the kitchen, and you can literally watch the magic happen in the open kitchen! I had a fabulous time watching as they prepared each dish, and then enjoying the food as well. I could only stay for a few of the dishes, but my favorite was definitely the goat empanada. For anyone dining at Girl and the Goat, I highly suggest you order it! I don't even care for goat (it's too gamey for me), but there is absolutely NOT gamey-ness to this, and it's SO delicious!Thanks for the awesome time ""pretending"" to help in the kitchen and for the delicious dishes! And for the fun experience of watching a professional chef in the kitchen."
"If you are craving comfort food, then this is where you must go!!! I have tried pretty much every dish on their menu, and it is always so hearty and delicious! I am always happy eating here, and by happy I mean getting that warm, fuzzy feeling in me!! I liked Girl and the Goat, however Little Goat is a better choice for me! I love the whole upscale diner feel with big plates of food which are still way too fancy to be at a diner!"
"Amazing brunch with a large menu and lots of variety. Unlike Girl and the Goat, you can get a table after 20-30 minutes as opposed to 2-3 months.  The only negative aspect is the same as at G&G, which is, if you are a party of 2, you may be seated at the same table as another party of 2 you are unfamiliar with. Luckily we were a party of 4 so we got to sit in a nice booth and watch the strangers sit awkwardly at the same tables. Food: We ordered a cinnamon role for the table to split and we were so glad we did, Yummy! Lots of icing though, so if that is not your thing, you may not enjoy it. We also got an order of hash browns for the table, which have cheese inside of them. I got the Bull's eye french toast, and it was right on target! (get it?) Anyways, it is topped with strawberries, chicken and and egg. It sounds like a strange combo but it works.  I will have to come back to try some more  creative combinations!!"
"Went back 4 weeks later with him.  I made reservations, as we had tickets to a show at 7:30pm.  Called to say we'd be 3-5 minutes late, said ""no problem!""  We walked through the door at 5:02pm.  They told us they were waiting for a few tables to clear, then we'd be sat.  Welp, they sat a whole MESS of walk-ins before us, and then I saw the hostess say, ""oh shit, that reservation was 5, it's 5:17!""  Welp, thankfully, they sacrificed a 4-top for the two of us.  We were in our cushy booth at 5:18pm.  And then we sat.  And picked out drinks.  Then an app.  And our meals.  And DESSERT.  No server until 5:34pm.  Luckily, he was friendly, and apologetic enough to be sincere but not annoying.  He wasn't our original server, but he noticed an opportunity to deliver good service and did so.  His name was Carl, and because of him, our less-than-stellar start was turned around!Food was good, as to be xpected.  YUM."
For all chicken and waffle lovers this is the place to go. Phenomenal coffee for all the brunchers out there. Not to mention there drink menu is great as well.
"The two stars is for the service. Our food was a greasy mess. The omelette had a brown crispness like it was fried in an inch of grease. Daughter had CB hash & eggs. The hash had dry salty corned beef on the bottom, next layer shredded potatoes that were all crisp, no regular potato just shredded of brown crisp. Egg was greasy as well. Even the cookie from the bakery, oatmeal cherry, was flavorless except for the cherries. All that for $40. Never again."
"Decent...well presented food. Ultimately, however just not that tasty. In a city full of amazing flavors, the overraught creations here are just not worth the time or the price. Skip the hype and save yourself the disappointment."
"SLOPPY and Worth It!If sloppy joes made with Manwich sauce make you smile with nostalgia, hurry to Little Goat Diner. Just off the plane, I savored views of the river and stunning architecture during my 2 mile walk to the restaurant. I joined nearly two dozen diners experiencing a mid-afternoon meal (2:30 pm) under the skylit ceiling with an occasional glimpse into the open kitchen. Torn between 75 options from breakfast indulgences, burgers & sandwiches to dishes that blurred the lines between AM and PM (e.g. Breakfast spaghetti 'n clams n' crab), I took a risk. Go simple and hope for spectacular.Sean delivered in service and nudged me toward the Sloppy Goat over the Goat Burger. Right on! Succulent and served on a squish squash roll (buttery brioche) with tangy slaw on top. Although I loved the spices, this made the goat more subtle in taste - if there's a way to make the goat more prominent, just imagine. Wait, there's more. The Corn Elote side dish was heaven...fresh grilled corn sliced off the cob and I'm guessing tossed in a creamy chili sauce with a squeeze of lime and a sprinkling of cheese. Crunchy, spicy, nutty and tart -- no better way to taste the final days of summer.Thanks to Top Chef Stephanie Izard for my new food memory. 74 more dishes to try..."
"I honestly believe that this place sits right in the middle. It's not the worst that I've had but there wasn't anything that made me want to jump for joy. The patty melt was pretty traditional and pretty greasy. So, if grease and mediocre food are ok with you- you should be fine."
"I've been on somewhat of a Little Goat tear lately, but I think it's still going to stay at 3 stars for me. Don't get me wrong, the food is delicious for the most part, but most of that deliciousness comes from copious amounts of fat and sugar, and in the end, I'm not a fan of super heavy food loaded with fat and sugar.Machos nachos ($14) were described as a life changing experience by a friend. Yes, these nachos came in an enormous portion, and yes, these nachos were very, very good - especially the puffy, crunchy house-made chips. But these nachos were also a bit too much. I could've done without the heaps of cheese and sour cream, and the BBQ sauce from the made the chips soggy very fast. On the other hand, the pickled onions and peppers were amazing with the pulled pork. I'd call them the best nachos I've had, but that bar is set pretty low, and I think this is a case where less is more!Brandade and belly ($14) was an interesting take on eggs benedict. The square housemade biscuits were amazing - warm, dense, and noticeably loaded with butter in every bite. The kimchi and pickled jalapenos provided the much-needed acidity, fried eggs were perfectly runny. The brandade is an excellent alternative to hollandaise, but I think there was only one small piece of (very tasty) pork belly in the entire dish. At the end of the day, I'd definitely come back to Little Goat, I just wish they'd be a little less heavy handed on the fat and achieve the same (or in many cases better) results!"
"Solid brunch place. I had the shrimp and cheesy grits since I'm not a super breakfast food girl. The shrimp was good but the sauce kind of made the whole thing more soupy than I like. Lost the cheesy grits I was looking forward to. I also has the special seafood bisque, it was good but nothing spectacular.The atmosphere is really nice and the photobooth is fun."
I've eaten here twice and both meals for lunch have been a home run! Plus they serve Zombie Dust. Can't lose here!!
Totally surprised the food was incredible had the brazen beef with avocado sub incredible with the Dijon kind of sauce I must go to eat in Chicago
"Overpriced and overrated. I was disappointed after all the buzz about this place. It was not that exciting, just located in a bourgeoisie area.Just go to Portillo's for diner food."
Pork nachos... that's all I have to say... mmmmmm :)
"I dined here for Sunday brunch and loved every bit of it!  This is one of the restaurants Stephanie Izard (Top Chef Season 4 winner) co-owns and is the executive chef at.We were told the wait would be around 30 minutes so we headed to the back bar, coffee bar and merchandise shop.  We ordered bloody marys and mimosas, and I purchased a masala rub for $6 to take home and try.  We were seated probably within 15-20 minutes.Everything on the menu looked delicious, but I ended up ordering the Bulls Eye French Toast (per a recommendation from the waiter).  It was AMAZING.  It's french toast with a circle cut out of the middle and an egg cooked inside, topped with lightly fried chicken and strawberries.  I was worried it might be heavy but it was the perfect amount of cube shaped fried chicken pieces.My friends ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles (peanut butter, bananas, bacon maple syrup) and the Kimchee & Bacon, Eggs, & Pancakes Asian Style and both of those were also delicious.  We asked the waiter if Stephanie was in the restaurant and she was working an event upstairs but took a few minutes of her time to come by and say hello.This was an all around amazing dining experience, complete with delicious food and friendly service.  I would definitely recommend checking it out!"
"I definitely think my meal at Little Goat was one of my favorite in Chicago.  I was in town for 9 days traveling for work, and my coworker and I went to Little Goat on a Tuesday night.  We were able to score a reservation for 2 at 6:15 pm, which was perfect for us.We shared the sides of brussel sprouts and broccoli, which were amazing.  For dinner, he had the goat korean burger, and I had the veggie burger All American style.  I tried a bite of the goat burger and it was delightful -- very moist and good flavor.  My All American was basically a veggie Big Mac.  Just so you know, the burgers come as-is on the plate -- no sides unless you order them.  We got french fries to share.  Yum.For dessert we tried the chocolate cake (it was a special that night), and the caramel/chocolate tart thing.  OMG.  We tried so hard to eat all of the food and we were stuffed.  Amazing.  I would highly recommend coming here if you're visiting Chicago from out of town and want a fun experience.  (Actually, I'd recommend coming here.  Period.)"
"Their Kimchi burger is one of the best burgers I've ever had. They also have a great selection of fresh made bread in the adjoining bakery, as well as the dopest and freshest cookies in the city."
Two thumbs up...Way up! One of the best brunches I've ever had. The grilled cheese sandwich and the BBQ Pork sandwich...to die for! Simply delish. And the service was awesome!
Cool location and atmosphere. The server would not make any suggestions on popular or specialty items however their menu is mostly specialty items. I ordered the Elvis Waffles and it was good. The bacon in syrup was awesome. I would order again but I think if you aren't craving something with a sweet kick then don't get this. The wait for lunch was about a half hour but it seemed as though you could call ahead. I would come back again for sure.
"Bueller would be proud. Pulled a Ferris Bueller after Lollapalooza weekend and skipped work to sleep and eat. I took advantage of finding a bunch reso at Little Goat and headed over. We were seated immediately and despite my request, rooftop was closed :(. Feeling extra fatty, I tried the tiramisu shake and he had coffee. Shake was $7 and I felt I was drinking a $2.99 chocolate shake from Denny's. It had little pieces of chocolate cereal or dried up bread, couldn't tell the difference. His coffee was so strong, he used half the damn raw sugar to sweeten it up. Service was quick and efficient despite it being crazy packed for 11:30a on a Monday. Maybe all the hungover Lolla-goers pulled the same move as us?Out came my veggie loco moco and his bulls eye French toast. I tried a piece of his without the chicken and omg, it's amazing. You get sucker-punched with sweet maple syrup, strawberries, then saltiness from the egg inside takes over. Very, very good. My loco was just what I was craving, comforting carbs and eggs. The portion was massive and I took 1/2 home. I scoped out their pancakes and Mac and cheese which look equally amazing. I will definitely return the next time I skip work!"
"I've been to Little Goat twice-once for breakfast and another time for lunch.  This place has completely amazed me both times.  They have a great outdoor patio that is the perfect place to enjoy a little people watching and an amazing culinary creation. On my latest visit, I met a friend for a farewell Chicago lunch.  I'm so glad that I got to eat at Little Goat one more time before relocating.  The menu is so varied that I had a hard time making up my mind about what to order.  I was deciding between ordering the tuna melt and a ""healthy"" chickpea salad.  I asked the server for her recommendation, and she raved about the tuna melt that is served open-faced and topped with their mac n cheese sauce.I am so happy that I went with the server's recommendation.  It. was. amazing.  Seriously, amazing.  Normally, tuna melts are served in a greasy spoon and aren't anything to write home about.  this was not the case at Little Goat.  The mac n cheese sauce was phenomenal.  I can't even think about it without my mouth watering.I will definitely be back next time I'm in Chicago.  And seriously, get the tuna melt!"
"I've only been to the cafe/bakery section, so this rating is for that. I did get to take a look around the diner area and I loved the decor. It's very art deco. It seems a bit pricey from the other reviews on here, but I'd like to go back and try it.As for the cafe/bakery section, it was very cool. They have a top-of-the-line espresso machine, and they display that and the other equipment very nicely in a small counter area. It's a bit confusing, as this area is located at the front of the shop, but you order your coffee in the back. There's a small sign that tells you this though.It's very cramped in there. A skinny hallway accommodates the coffee counter and a bakery counter. It's loud and hard to move around. There are very few chairs.What I did like was the window in the back that peaked into the bakery area. You can see what the chefs are working on. Makes for a more authentic experience.As for the actual coffee, I was brought here by my cousin who loves Stumptown Coffee. To his knowledge, this is only one of two shops in the Chicago area that serves Stumptown. I got a macchiato and it was very good. My cousin got the drink of a day, which was named after a famous person, and that was also very good.The diner and the bakery area are connected, so it's easy to go from place to place. This is a cute shop with great coffee. I'd love to come back and try their bread sometime!"
"Adjectives: delicious, filling, creative, busyDish: Korean Goat BurgerI like this place more than its famous sister restaurant, the Girl and the Goat. The food at Little Goat is creative and delicious, but also accessible.  It elevates home cooked food like sloppy joes and breakfast dished to distinct flavor profiles. I am working my way through the menu and have not had a weak dish yet.  The Korean kimchee burger is particularly good- it is a buttery burger but balanced by the tangy pickled cabbage. Their homemade hot sauce is great.Service is great and the space has a vintage dinner nod, but with modern flair.  They take reservations, which I recommend because the place is always busy. However, I rarely plan ahead, and frequently get seated at open space at the bar. This is actually more enjoyable, so you can watch the food being prepared."
"4.5 stars! My last ""stuff my face"" stop on my amazing trip to Chicago! During my vacation planning, most brunch places didn't allow reservations and if they do, trying to reserve two weeks in advance was pretty difficult. It isn't any easier at their sister company The Girl and the Goat across the way (good for dinner!)A few friends and I were lucky enough that when we got to Little Goat at 12 on a Sunday, there was only a 30 minute wait. (This is coming from a local friend). For those of you in San Diego, I guess compare waiting times to Snooze. Eeks! Difference is? They have a nice adjacent bar/coffee shop/snack stop right next door while you wait. And after the night before, the coffee I had while I waited was on point!Okay, enough of the intro. This is what you get: (though you pretty much can't go wrong with anything on the menu I""m sure) - Bulls Eye French Toast - Sweet Onion Brioche with the Egg cooked in the middle with crispy chicken pieces topped with bbq maple syrup! Noms!- Shrimp and Grits- It's a staple dish for me. I probably shouldn't have ordered it and should have tried something different. BUT I couldn't help it. It's a good thing there were a few other ppl there that allowed me to try their orders. No complaints and loved this dish! - Spanish Omelette- Tasted fresh and eggs were fluffy. This definitely felt like the ""healthy"" options between all of the other options. Definitely still satisfying. The whole menu really looked amazing. And I'm almost sad that there werent like 10 of us there so we could each grab a dish. OH! Their tempura mash potato appetizer. GET IT. You'll thank me later. I'm not one for the battered stuff, but i wanted to inhale this. Enjoy!"
Solid food. Solid flavors! Stephanie Izard is awesome! My husband tried the little pig in China and the dish was impressive. Who would of known blackberries and sesame oil worked together?! I had the Chicken BBQ French toast. Very tasty. It was a surprise to see an egg cooked in the middle of the French toast. So glad we got to try this place while on vacation!
"Our experience was mixed. We took an early reservation and we knew going in the ambiance would be one of a 'diner' (casual, and a bit frenetic) but as the evening progressed, it was actually impossible to carry on a conversation because of the kitchen noises and loud piped in music. One would expect noise levels would rise when a restaurant starts to fill w/patrons but we felt by the end of the meal, we couldn't hear one another. The wait staff could NOT have been more attentive! Should absolutely be commended for their front of house training. The food - we shared 1 entre (crab dip) and 5 mains - we thought the choice of 'Ritz' crackers w/ the dip was an odd albeit pedestrian choice. The hit of the mains was the fish tacos. The failure was a VERY dry tonkstsu between 'white' bread slices - again, in our opinion, a very odd carb choice but overcooking the tonkatsu was the bigger disappointment. With so many Chicago food establishments to choose from, it's hard to imagine returning for a second go but if we were to try, a brunch or lunch might be a better choice for us! Given the hype surrounding this chef and her establishments, overall, it was a letdown."
"Call Little Goat your upscale whatever goes diner. Practically everything is available 24/7 on the menu - so whether your heart desires breakfast, brunch, lunch, dinner....order as you please. They've got a good mix of savory and sweet unconventional items such as GOAT and their bakery fresh crumpets. Every time I'm a first-timer at a restaurant, I've got to choose the one exotic item off the menu. This time, I went with the crumpets with chorizo bathed in maple syrup garnished with bite-sized tomatoes. While 3 miniscule crumpets may look like it may not fill you, rest assured, it was the perfect portion without feeling overly full. My companion went all out with the goat almighty burger stacked a skewer's length high with braised beef, bbq pork, and some sweet fixin's. He was only able to finish 1/2 of that monster, and I chowed down the other 1/2. Goat patties are a little different...more chewy and lean texture-wise. Now, what would've been nice is the option to add an a la carte item to your meal at a reduction. $6 for smoked fries, which were addictively good and non-greasy. While it was a nice brunch/lunch, I can't justify spending $40 on 2 people unless it was some special occasion. Thus, minus 1 star for value. If you're from out of town, the streets are kind of strange there and parking is probably 1/2 a block down where they have the pay-to-park stations. I'd probably come back in the future, just that there are so many other unique breakfast options in Chi town I've got to try before stumbling back here again."
"Kinda expensive for what the food is.  The quantity of the food is wonderfully overwhelming, but the quality suffered in expense. 5 of my friends and I went and we ordered an entree each, but we all ended up leaving so much on our plates. I ordered the goat chili and it was way too salty and oily for my liking. My friend ordered the donkatsu sandwich and it really was just mediocre donkatsu with white wonderbread-like bread.. . My friend got a kimchi pancake, and that was really interesting and delicious. My other friend got a hamburger and he was incredibly shocked by the amount of salt in the burger-he had to order something else.The nachos were incredibly delicious, and I would come again just for those.On the plus side, it is a nice restaurant to visit because of the unique vibe it provides. It gives you the air of being at a high class restaurant and also the comfort of being in a diner. The server was so sweet and nice- she got a wonderful icecream smoothie for my friend, because it was her birthday!"
"Little Goat Diner transcends omelets and French toast, serving an all-day breakfast menu strewn with ethnic-inspired dishes. From Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup to Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes to a South Asian Parathas Burrito, the menu is just familiar enough but with flavorful twists to keep dishes interesting. Shrimp and Cheesy Grits are my breakfast weapon of choice, though. Plump rock shrimp. Braised pistachio. Brussels sprout leaves. Buttery grits studded with green onion and warm, red tomatoes. I'll take this over pancakes any day.To wash it all down? Order ""The Little Goat"" - an espresso, goat milk, whipped cream and caramel treat."
"Ahhh-mazing!Thank you fellow Yelpers - you did not steer me wrong! My BF and I went to Little Goat for brunch a few weeks ago and we're sure glad we did. We arrived around 10:30am and only had to wait a few minutes before we were sat. I'd recommend getting there before 11am to avoid an hour wait.Food: The food was the bomb dot com. We started with the bloody mary's ($11) each which were delicious and spicy. For an appetizer, we got the tempura mashed potatoes ($5), they are a must have if you haven't tried them before. My BF got the corned beef hash, which was flavorful and delicious. The same goes for the braised beef sandwich ($14) I ordered, it was savory and tender. Service: Our server was great, one of the best waitresses we've had in a long time. She was extremely friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about all menu items.Parking: Street parking, which wasn't too bad. I found a spot almost immediately.Overall, everything from the food, drinks and service was fabulous and I cannot wait to go back!"
"The atmosphere was good, and the food was great. The omelette of the day is guaranteed to satisfy you. Just make sure you don't come expecting to pay cheap for the menu items. They have quality, and that's what you pay for."
Hip place with a huge flavorful menu of comfort food. Everything looked so good I didn't know what to order. We had a nice quiet afternoon lunch here. I ordered the Tonkatsu (a breaded pork cutlet with Asian BBQ sauce and cabbage on bread - yum). I was surprised how big my sandwich was. The service was great and I enjoyed the spacious restaurant with its open kitchen and the attached bakery. They even have dining on their rooftop that is also used for parties (and yoga too!). I'm hoping to try the corned beef hash next time I'm in.
"I've been to Little Goat three times; twice for brunch, once for dinner, and I'm honestly unfazed by the place, for a few reasons: 1. Most of the sandwiches are $12-14 (maybe one or two are $10-11), and they are a la carte. If you want a small order of fries it's an additional $2.50 or so!!2. The second time here, I sat at a communal table with about 5 friends. Our food took some time to get to the table, and they completely forgot one of our orders. They brought her some soup while she waited (saying it was taking a while, but it didn't come out for another 35+ minutes--clearly they didn't even put it in). The most absurd part? They put the complimentary soup on the bill. We got it taken off but this was one of the most unprofessional dining experiences I've ever had (especially given the price point!!). 3. If you're looking for a brunch spot that serves your traditional savory tooth when you're at the height of your hangover, I would go elsewhere. 90% of the brunch menu involves some sort of shellfish and/or kimchi (of which I am allergic, the latter do not care for), and when I was there, in need of a hearty brunch dish, I was sorely disappointed I couldn't find even a traditional eggs benny on the menu.4. Each time I was here I had to wait at least 45 minutes for a table--and to me, the wait was never worth it due to disappointing food, service, and atmosphere. Honestly, you could wait the same amount of time, pay less money, and get more/better food for a dish at Au Cheval and be more satisfied. Thus, I have to say I do not recommend Little Goat."
"It's a quirky diner with plenty of open space. The food combinations sound weird, but they taste so great!  It's a classic diner feel with gourmet versions of diner food. I want to go back again and again! P.S. Kimchi was not fermented, but it was ok!"
"This place is a must while you're in Chicago. I was afraid that Girl on the Goat was going to be too long of a wait and expensive so I thought we would try their little sister restaurant instead. Definitely worth the bang for your buck. Got there and was seated at a communal table right away. Great atmosphere and wonderful service. For dinner, we ordered:- Tempura Mashed Potatoes: OMG... their mashed potatoes are so delicious! I'm assuming they also use their garlic mashed potatoes for this dish. And then to cover it with tempura with deep fry it? HEAVEN! The garnish and sauce that came with it gave it just the right balance. If anything, I would come here just to get that small dish.- Mac & Cheese: Pretty basic mac and cheese. Nothing too spectacular.- All American Burger: Patty was juicy and cooked to perfection. Had it well done. The buns was very different from what I've had. It didn't suck the juice of the burger at all. I wish I had a bigger wallet and bigger tummy to try other things but resources were limited. Definitely coming back here next time I'm in Chicago with more people so i can try more things!"
"Great breakfast spot in the warehouse district of Chicago.  Very hip, but not so much so that service is lax.  My wife got a belgian waffle and I got the hash and eggs.  Mine came out first and we waited quite a while for hers.  The manager came over to us after a bit, apologized profusely, and told us that the waffle-maker was broken and burnt hers.  He made her a fresh one and, of course, comped us for it.Both meals were delicious and the staff/management handled the issue perfectly."
"Three of us went to dinner here last night. Two are now queasy and one spent the night vomiting and already has a call in to her doctor. How does this happen, you ask? Undercooked chicken, that's how.We were all quite excited for our dinner at Little Goat as none of us had been there but had heard great things. We arrive and the evening starts well. The waitress seems nice and attentive and our drinks and starters arrive promptly and are quite good. The issue begins with the main course--all three of us ordered the fried chicken after asking for suggestions. I noticed that my chicken leg could have been cooked longer but the wing is cooked perfectly. It's not until I slice into my breast, which actually requires me to saw into the meat with my knife, that I suspect that this piece is more than just a little tough. When I part the meat, I see that it is pink which anyone who has ever cooked a chicken will know is not the proper color for a fully cooked breast (unless it has been barbecued but this, again, is fried chicken).When the waitress returns to our table I tell her that I'm afraid the breast is not done. She proceeds to tell me that it's ""just the way they cook it"". I admit, at this point I give her a funny look because I have NEVER been told a restaurant intentionally undercooks their chicken. That's just asking for serious bacterial issues. I proceed to explain that, no, I cook. I fry chicken. This is not how it should be cooked. Again, she insists that this is the way it's done because of the type of bird they use and that it's very expensive. It's at this point that I take hold of the breast with one hand and use my fork to pry the meat apart. It takes enough effort that my hand shakes a little. ""Cooked chicken doesn't do that,"" I say. She seems annoyed but says they can cook it longer, if I like. At that point, I should have asked for a manager but I try to be a courteous and pleasant customer so I ask that they please do so. My friend is sitting where she can see into the kitchen and she sees the waitress show the chef, who also seems irritated. I assume they zap it in the microwave for a minute or so and return the plate to me. The chicken is much more tender and the right color, on the surface. Once I slice further into the meat, I again notice pink. I uploaded two pictures of the chicken, both taken AFTER it had been returned to me. Notice that it is still a shade of pink that indicates it hasn't been fully cooked. Then go back and read the first sentence of this review."
"I wish I could give this four and a half stars (because I reserve 5 stars for the super fancy nice restaurants).  It's comfy, inviting, bright AND has amazing food. Every single thing I ate was delicious. Fish tostadas with the pea shoots side (leafy greens in a light tangy sauce) and the choco taco sundae for dessert.  UGH. So freaking good.I also wish I lived in Chicago (instead of just visiting) to come here more often!"
"Absolutely amazing food, timely service, clean space, and pleasant ambiance. There was really little more that I could have asked from the place in terms of food quality. We showed up and were seated immediately. I got the Korean Burger and Alex got the Sloppy Goat. We also hit up the mac and cheese. Everything on the menu is a la carte, which means you get only what you order and no ""extras"" (like the fries that folks like myself think come with the burger). My burger was fantastic--I would have liked the spicy mayo to be spicier though--there was very little, if any, kick to it. The Sloppy Goat was really great as well; wouldn't really change anything here. The mac n cheese was exceptional, except that for the price I would have liked a slightly bigger serving. I would also suggest that the burgers come with the side of fries. Even if it's a small side, a nod to the ""fries are complementary when ordering a burger"" establishment would be much appreciated by gluttons like myself. Plus, this place is a diner--it is quintessentially Americana and synonymous with oversized servings and fries with a side of coronary, no?Overall, exceptional food and great service. Would absolutely recommend."
"Loved this place! Service was great and it was great ""foodie"" comfort food! Our party of 4 started out with the Bread of the Day which was Bacon Gouda. I seriously could have eaten this all night. We also ordered the crab dip served with Ritz crackers and it was perfect. Unlike Little Goat's sister restaurant, the main dishes are not tapas style. We each ordered a full entree for ourselves: Pork Belly Pancake, Tuna Melt, Grilled Cheese and the Skirt Steak and then a huge order of fries and Mac and Cheese for everyone to share. The portions were very generous and only my boyfriend was able to be a part of the Clean Plate Club. We all really liked we what we had ordered. I'm glad I finally was able to get a table here and I'd come back again to dine!"
Went back for brunch and had the corned beef hash. Wow!!! That was amazing!! Great! Tasted fresh. Looked great. I loved it.
"Where do I even begin?! When I reminisce about my experience here I get the warm fuzzies inside. Ok on to the real reason your reading my review...Short version- sit at the bar. Anything you order will blow your mind. Service was fantastic. Actual deets- What we had: my boyfriend ordered the tonkatsu sandwich- basically the asian inspired version of a pork tenderloin sandwich. It was huge, but absolutely amazing. Would definitely get again and again. I had the reuben. Reuben's are not my normal go to but I saw them keep coming out of the kitchen and they looked phenomenal, so I thought what the heck. I am so glad i did. Bread was crunchy, corned beef was super flavorful, great amount of sauce and house sauerkraut. What more could you ask for?Also, if you order ANYTHING you MUST order the tempura fried mashed potatoes. I'm pretty sure I don't have to tell you why...Why sit at the bar? Because you get a first hand look at everything everyone else is ordering. I always want to know what the food looks like before I order, so this was a definite perk."
"Ordered the Lostran Sandwich with braised beef, avocado, cabbage, red onions and special sauce. Like Little Goat's version of an Italian beef sandwich. Tastes great and doesn't feel unhealthy!The seating arrangement in the restaurant is great. There are plenty of booths with nice seating cushions complimented by diner style seating in front of the kitchen."
Easy seating for brunch on an early Tuesday morning. Wish the booth table space was a tad roomier but we managed ok with our winter layers on. Caffeine: Our special milk tea latte and little goat double espresso were incredible. Food: GET the NACHOS to share.. You won't regret it and I mean business when it comes to my Mexican food. I would come back for that and the lattes alone. Super fresh chips and generous toppings. Had the Bulls eye French Toast which I wish I had gotten the sauce on the side to lighten it a bit after filling up on the nachos. The egg in the center was a pleasant surprise to see gush out as I reached the center of the toast. Fried chicken wasn't bad but I miss the bone-in style moist fried chicken that comes with other breakfast options elsewhere as I was hoping for a chicken and waffles type meal. Overall still too sweet for me but I am a savory brunch dish person I am learning. Hash browns were great as a fresh delicious side too (prepared with cheese.. Can't go wrong there right?!) Sausage side was also amazing. Loved the house made hot sauces (chipotle and the spicier habanero option were both good!). Huge menu with lots of options. We definitely needed a few minutes to decide. Just beware the portions are generous otherwise you will leave feeling very uncomfortable like I did ;)
"Overall, Ok.. average overpriced food. I've been there few times with different group of friends. The pork scallion pancake is good and would probably order again. The little goat coffee - enjoyed it.Korean burger and the mushroom burger is okay average.  Burger is probably the safest item to orderThe bullseye french toast is tasty the first few bites, but it was drenched in oil. Pretty cool how the over easy egg is baked inside the french toast. Short rib over fried rice - Short rib was tasty, but its the typical korean short rib. I totally dislike having fruits (strawberries) in my fried rice. The fruit was getting soggy and flavor did not go well.The fried chicken $18 comes with  3 pieces (breast, thigh, and drum). The dark meat was juicy and the breast was dry. IT was literally fried chicken and didnt taste much seasoning or flavor. I better off order from Harold's chicken or Popeye for the family meal"
"I've been here twice: once the day after I competed in a triathlon (you can bet I was still hungry the next day) and the other this past weekend with my boyfriend. I'll focus mostly on my most recent dining experience here because it's most salient. It was a Saturday at around 6, which is prime time for dinner. The last time I had come to Little Goat, I had had a reservation, so I had reservations about coming without one (heh). We actually originally had put our names down for dinner at Au Cheval where the wait time was THREE HOURS. We were already hungry and Little Goat was also on our list of places to go in the West Loop, so we thought we would drop by to see if the wait time was better. And it was! Much to our excitement, we were seated immediately at the bar at Little Goat. Score! Service: Service was a little bit spotty. Our waitress wasn't particularly attentive to us and, oddly, she absentmindedly filled my water glass, leaving my boyfriend's empty, then filled his maybe 10 minutes later. We were able to flag her for the check in a reasonable amount of time, so there were no other issues.Food: I decided on the white fish chilaquiles for something different (normally I would head straight over to the all-day breakfast food part of the menu). Last time I was here, I got a portobello mushroom burger with shoestring onions on top and it was incredible. The chilaquiles were amazing, too, complete with salad on the top. I was surprised at first when these came out of the kitchen because it looked at first like it was just a bunch of salad! I really enjoyed my main entree. We also had ordered brussels sprouts, which were supposed to be an appetizer. I would have preferred to receive the brussels sprouts before our meal, but it came out as a side. The brussel sprouts were disappointing. They were cooked perfectly, which is not always the case for brussels sprouts. However, they were MUCH too salty. I would definitely not order these again. It was not palatable at all! Even though I love Girl & the Goat, I also found a few of the dishes to be way too sodium-laden for my tastes, which was consistent with Little Goat. Overall, we had a great experience. We both really enjoyed our entrees and were eager to try the breakfast part of the menu next time!"
"Fun comfort food - you'll have a hard time deciding what to order. The tempura mashed potatoes are definitely worth getting as one of your side dishes (and I usually forgo mashed potatoes these days). It's also an added bonus that they serve breakfast food all day. My one complaint (aside from the sloppy goat, which tasted *really* gamey, and I like game meat) is that it's really loud in this place. Choose your company accordingly."
"I came here for dinner last week and shared the strawberry short shake, smoked fries, cheesy garlic french bread, Korean burger, and pecan pie. The Korean burger was quite tasty but extremely hard to eat because the bun was soggy. The cheesy garlic bread was good, but the marinara was bland. The shake, fries, and pecan pie were tasty. The service was so-so. We told our waitress we'd like to share the shake, and she came back with two straws and seemed irritated with us when we asked for a second glass.Overall, everything was mediocre. The breakfast menu looks interesting so I would go back again to try that, but I would not go back for dinner."
Good food and drinks. Fun places. On the bar side around closing time we got complementary cookies and whoopi pies. The bartender was really nice as well.
"I usually don't review places that already have 1,000 or more entries...hell, even if they 500 or more. I always think, what can I say that hasn't already been said? But here I am writing this, so bear with me. I finally went here on a date after hearing so much about the place. Our reservation on a snowy Chicago Sunday at 8pm was not necessary, but we wanted to play it safe. It was busy, but not crowded. We had a nice booth along the window facing Randolph close to the bakery entryway. There are two sides - the diner and the bakery. They call it a diner but I think it is only a by design, a very hip and atypical one. The food is not your typical diner fare. It is upscale, although you can still order pancakes, milkshakes, burgers, etc. But they offer veggie burgers, chickpea salad, a veggie quesadilla and a few others items (mainly breakfast). In the end I decided on the veggie chap chae. Korean sweet potato based noodles (basically angel hair) with mushrooms, tomatoes and feta cheese, among other things. It was a bit salty but I enjoyed it. It was $15 so a little pricey. My date ordered the beef stroganoff with feta, which was the special. It was $23 and while he enjoyed, it definitely was NOT worth the $23 price tag. That knocked down the rating for me. Call me cheap, but it wasn't worth it. The Bloody Marys, however, were deeeelish. Nice and spicy and garnished with a cheese stuffed olive, a grape tomato and a green bean. Yum! I was a fan of those. Our waiter was attentive and chatty. His suggestions were helpful, but in the end I think I will stick to the more traditional menu items in the future. I would like to go back because of the creative vegetarian options. And the bakery also looked appealing. We capped off our meal with a classic sundae - vanilla gelato, chocolate sauce, whipped cream and a cherry on top. That was delightful although once again, $7 seemed a tad much. I guess some times you just have to live it up! And make sure your date pays :-)"
"I made reservations for two way ahead of time because for a place like this, I didn't feel like waiting 40 plus minutes.  The menu is interesting and I wanted to order everything on it.  Everything looked tasty.  I settled for the Mushroom burger (beef - not goat).  It was good, but messy (sauce was oozing through my fingers) and a tad on the more salty side. The daily bread is always a good choice and I enjoyed the curry vegetables we ordered as a side.  My husband loved the Los Drowned sandwich.  Overall, service was friendly and the space is real nice.  I definitely want to come here again!"
"Made a reservation for a friend who was visiting from out of town and I. When we arrived they couldn't find our reservation, which made me think we were going to go elsewhere, but they were able to seat is in about 15 minutes which was awesome!The menu was huge! Everything we ate was delicious and you could definitely split all the dishes. I crave the nachos, so make sure to get those!Our server was friendly and attentive despite the restaurant being super busy.So many of the ""Top Chef"" restaurants in Chicago are underwhelming, but not Little Goat! I'll be back!"
"This place has become our go to spring/summer weekend brunch spot. The place is awesome, service is amazing and the food is great. As a person who views brunch as an excuse to eat breakfast later in the day, I decided to change it up and try some of their lunch and dinner options and was very pleased.I had the Fried chicken which was perfectly crispy with great flavor. The pieces were big and the meat was juicy....now...it also come with a biscuit....and it is quite possibly the best biscuit I have ever had in my life. So so so good.Always a great mix of cocktails as well. They do a very good job of keeping beer and cocktails light and refreshing."
"I was already in the area when looking for a place to grab a good, yet affordable, bite with a small group of friends. Little Goat had been suggested to me by more than one person as a tasty option that wouldn't break the bank. The four of us were able to be seated at the communal table right away. Our table had nearly every seat full, but there was plenty of space for the 3 or 4 parties occupying the space. Our waitress was super friendly and helpful with our orders, and we got our food fairly quickly, although not all meals were brought out at the same time. Breakfast is served all day, so even though it was after 8 PM, I was able to order the Parathas Burrito. It was the perfect combination of tasty and filling without being too heavy. I really enjoyed my meal and hope to go back soon to try out more of the menu items!"
"Little Goat hardly needs one more five-star review, but one more five-star review is what it's going to get!Four of us had a reservation for 6:45 on Saturday night. We were seated right away by a pleasant staff member. Our waiter was prompt and helpful.We ordered chicken strips and crab dip, three cocktails, and a beer right away. The appetizers were delicious, as were the cocktails.For dinner two of us ordered shrimp and grits, one ordered the patty melt, and one ordered the goat burger. All of it was delicious.We had two desserts, the daily special Mexican chocolate layer cake, and a sundae. Again, both were amazing.Service continued to be top notch all night long.Not a single complaint, and can't wait to go back."
"Came in with expectations that were probably a bit too high. Based on the location and decor, I thought this place would be a revolutionary diner experience. In the end, it was pretty good diner food, but at ""trendy restaurant"" prices. The service was good, but I guess I was expecting a little more from the food. But if you go in with normal expectations, you probably won't be disappointed. It is nice that they have a separate gluten free menu (although watch out, some of the items on that menu say that they do in fact have ""trace"" amounts of gluten!) I would recommend placing a reservation through Open Table, that way you won't get stuck waiting a really long time. I'm not sure I would be happy waiting for over an hour!"
"Terrible service. Everyone seemed to have an attitude problem. Plates slammed on the table, refusal to make any dietary accomodations for my sister who simply needed her eggs cooked so that they would not be runny, when food was dropped off it was placed in the center of the table without explanation of what it was (there were six people at the table, so there were six entrees that we had to figure out for ourselves) and the food was awful. Soggy sandwiches, tasteless grits...the only good things were the items that came straight from the attached bakery. The entrees were expensive and should have been better priced. Not impressed and will not return."
"I had breakfast at Little Goat recently and am a convert after trying the Bulls Eye French Toast. Eggs and fried chicken over a piece of french toast with barbeque maple syrup on top.  Crazy, and crazy delicious.  Is their dinner menu still too greasy? Yes. But honestly, I'm not sure I care any more. I'll just go for breakfast."
"Just wish the Macho Nachos had a vegetarian option. Once you take away the meat, and now the beans the nachos are boring. Overall the place was niceand the service was ok."
"There are so many better options in that area that I still do not understand why this place is so popular. I tried the patty melt. One of the most greasy and dry burger ever... Moreover, it comes at 11$ (only the burger). Then, you have to add fries if you want and pay for them! really really bad experience.I liked the place and the environment but definitely won't go back again."
"Love this place!!! Every time I go here I am never disappointed. The wait can be long during brunch time on the weekends, and the customer service isn't the best, but overall I have always enjoyed my experience. Most recently I ordered the pork belly pancake. So delicious that I went back a couple weeks later to order it again... Actually writing this review about it is making me crave it..."
"Service is kind of slow but I still really enjoyed the food. If you're hungry go next door to get some pasties.we got a seat right away at 930 but the line grew immediately after us. No reservations!!Smoked fries are. Still a definite must get.I also enjoyed my brandade and belly, the belly is so soft and tender and well caramelized. Love it! Cookies Shake was delicious too.. Many cookie bits, not just the black and white cookies and cream shake!Also tried the kimchi Asian anything omelette - surprisingly light and delicious For yelpers with a sweet tooth, the chocolate chip crunch is awesome. Amazing chocolate butter ganache thing to spread on your pancake sprinkled with coco crunch. Yay. Another note, portions are definitely too much for an average person, bring a to go box or share!!"
"Came here for the first time to just stop by the bar. Drinks were excellent and the bartenders went out of their way to make drinks that you will enjoy. Not only were the drinks delicious but I learned a lot too! Came back a different night for a late night dinner. Ordered the korean burger which was good. Who would have thought kimchi on a burger would be so good?? But it works. Then ordered two desserts for the table. I'm not much if a dessert person, but maybe it's because I haven't been eating these desserts. The cake of the day was Elvis which was banana bread cake with a peanut butter creme with caramelized bacon bits! We also got a turtle pie - equally as delicious.. Thoroughly impressed everytime I've been!"
Just go and get the bacon milk shake thingy it's smokey and sweet and savory it's what I dream about. Also they're sammys are delicious and they are gods with fryers and potatoes. I got the mashed pot stop tempora and it was creamy and crunchy on the outside
"Yum but... Maybe not worth it?I had shrimp and cheesy grits and it was really yummy and flavorful but... I dunno. The service was pretty terrible. We were here for over an hour and we saw our waiter, like, twice. He did not seem to care at all about our experience. He appeared to take our order and deliver our order and that was pretty much it.Shrimp and grits were good and provided LOTS of shrimp but I was wishing for more grits. The flavor was yummy, though!My husband had loco moco and enjoyed it. We shared some cheesy hash browns and they were tasty but kinda greasy. Our friend has a club sandwich and smoked fries. The fries were awesome! I kinda wished we'd gotten those.Anyway, this was a delicious food experience but not an awesome service experience. I would probably come back if I was in the area though."
"A friend and I visited this Diner after a morning at the Shedd Aquarium with our two toddlers. We really appreciated the cookies and coffee from the adjoining cafe while we waited for our table to be ready. After a long morning, we were all tired and very hungry! Oatmeal raisin cookie for the win... SO good. I ordered the Reuben & a side of mac and cheese. The sandwiches are a bit pricey, considering no sides come with it. I would've liked to see you get french fries at least for a $14 sandwich. They are enormous tho, and one half of it went home for my dinner. Mac and cheese was wonderful!! Ordered it for the kids, but us adults ate it up too quick ;) Its a pretty loud diner, so perfect for families with children that like to make noise."
"To me nothing out of the ordinary.. the food was tasty, our server seemed to be in the weeds all the time and the noise level was just annoying! The coffees are really tasty so we just usually grab one on the go with my hubby!They always run out of their gluten free muffins way too early in the day -- maybe it would be time to reassess that issue and start making more!"
"Last night, four of us tried to go to Au Cheval to try their amazing burgers, but at 5:30pm on a Saturday the way was 3 and a half hours long. Yikes, sorry, I need to eat, can't wait that long. We walked over to Little Goat and the wait was only 45 minutes, sold, we're in. Walked over to Lone Wolf for some drinks and about 45 minutes later, we got a text. Service is great, food is great, menu has a wide variety from diner type food to higher end restaurant food. For appetizers we ordered the crab dip, which is my favorite by far. It's so damn good! I always need more Ritz crackers, I want to lick the plate clean after. We also got a crispy shrimp that was super delicious, it didn't even need to be dipped into the dip it came with. I ordered a patty melt the first time I went to Little Goat and last night I ordered the American burger. I have to say, Little Goat doesn't get credit for their burgers. They're actually really damn good. They're better than a lot of burgers I see on top burgers of Chicago lists. Everyone else at dinner absolutely loved their dinner and didn't feel robbed that we didn't get to go to Au Cheval. It doesn't deserve to be called a backup dinner, it was a damn good dinner on its own. Well done Little Goat, love it."
"A good place to bust new foodie ground, to satisfy that hankering of going to a hip and happening place DOWNTOWN, and to impress your date like yer in the know...But don't be blindly gaa gaa easily impressed or set yer expectations too high cuz its just another foodie flavor of the month joint with the cutesy fusion dishes (Korean here), farm to table schpeel, and gimicky spin on same ole food we all been eatin all our lives..."
"Sometimes I think because this is a Stephanie Izard place people feel like they should give it another star just for that... I don't disagree with them that, that's why I'd prioritze this place over other ""diners"" but likely for it's cute look/feel & the creative items on the menu which is why I'd go or give it an extra star. But overall everything I've had has really just been A-Ok... therefore three stars! Don't hate!I went on Monday night after unsuccessfully trying to get into Au Cheval down the street. There was a short wait but not bad, less time than they quoted us. My boyfriend ended up with the Korean burger: kimchi, bacon, egg, the works. It was good, not Au Cheval good but this isn't a ""burger place""... necessarily. I had the fun and crispy chicken sandwich... also good but not great. I wish there was an option to do half orders. Since everything is a-la cart and comes with no sides, I would have loved to have ordered half a sandwhich so that we could have splurged on sides.Speaking of, we did go with the goat chili cheese fries - clearly taking a day off from the new years diet. Boyfriend also had a milkshake - really, what diet? The waitress offered Whiskey and he was quick to agree that, that sounded like a fantastic idea - when the bill came and the milkshake was $7 and the Whiskey was $9 he had some buyers remorse... Will I go back? Certainly! Is it my favorite spot in town? Nawwww!"
"Little Goat is super good.  My husband and I have been here quite a few times--enough that I was surprised to see that I hadn't reviewed it before. There's a reason we keep coming back--it's really effing delicious. Tonight, we swung by around 6 for dinner. It wasn't very busy at all when we arrived, but the place was full by the time we left. We love the booths. The restaurant is also beautifully decorated without being stuffy or formal. I started my weekend of right with a glass of their house wine. The white was delicious and acidic, and only $5. Husband got a beer. We also started with fried pickles and onions which were totally awesome. Probably not the best ""date"" food but we are married so it doesn't really matter.Josh got the club sandwich which he said was one of the best clubs he has ever had. I went for the pork belly scallion pancake which was a little too salty/one note for me by still tasty. Neither of us finished but that's okay because we brought our leftovers home for when my husband gets hungry around 9-10pm.Lastly, we split the turtle pie. Holy  was it good. I can't remember enjoying a dessert this much in recent memory. The Oreo crust tasted like they left the creme in the mix--so. Good. It was perfect and I'm still so full I might puke. God job, Little Goat. You rule. P.s. This is totally arbitrary but I kinda love the vibe even more for breakfast. I love bottomless delicioso coffee and it's just a good place. Dinner good too though!"
"I went to Little Goat on a Friday afternoon during Memorial Day Weekend and waited forty minutes for a booth. Not too bad. The staff was very friendly, and it was one of the nicest diners I have ever been to. That being said, the food was too rich and too fatty for my liking. Goat Almighty: 3.5/5 -- A tall goat burger with beef, onion rings, cheese, and more. Definitely never had anything like this before. I understand that I should expect fattiness and richness when it comes to an order called the ""Goat Almighty,"" but I nevertheless expected more flavorful and appetizing ingredients. Machos Nachos: 3.5/5 -- Bursting with sour cream, pulled pork, cheese, and more. This is the kind of dish that is excellent for the first two, three bites -- and then the Law of Diminishing Returns really starts coming into play. Tastes great initially but you're very quickly over it. Nice place, and I want to come back to try less rich dishes from this place in the future."
"Just tried the new thing on the menu today: the little piggy went to China. It was really good, creative combination of authentic Sichuan flavor and American brunch! The Sichuan sausage was very authentic flavored! And the spice sauce on the biscuit taste so hometown. With the green Chinese onions on top, amazing!!! And of course, little goat would never fail in its biscuit!!"
"Oh my God, where do I begin. As avid Girl and the Goat fans, we chose Little Goat as the ideal spot to celebrate the end of a 28 day low-carb diet thingy my boyfriend and I did and then literally risked our lives in a blizzard to get there. We made the right decision.I assure you this is not a misguided review as a result of my sugar deprivation the previous month. Little Goat is da bomb. I started my meal with The Little Goat, a latte made with goat's milk that was a little funky, and therefore probably better for the more adventurous eater, but overall delicious. He went the alcohol route with the Russian Goat, which was ""decent."" I think he regretted not getting a coffee beverage like mine, which was more unique and cheaper. We then shared the parathas burrito which was wow and the dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes. Though I'm a chocolate fanatic, I actually think I liked the parathas burrito more. It was unique, delicious, and the *perfect* brunch item. The pancakes were more just like your normal chocolate chip pancakes but were nice and fluffy and came with yummy chocolate whipped butter deliciousness on the side.Beyond the food, our waiter was engaging, helpful, and patient despite the fact that it was a busy Sunday morning. These traits in a waiter are a serious rarity during Sunday brunch that should not be underrated. The decor was a wonderful throwback but modern diner feel that made me feel warm and fuzzy inside.A few things to note:We had a reservation because boo, waiting! But if you don't, I can imagine you'd have a bit of a wait, especially with a large group. So plan ahead!Next to the diner is a Little Goat bar/cafe/bakery hybrid. After brunch, we weren't eager to face the blizzard again so we hung out in there and he got his own Little Goat Latte."
"Between 4 and 5 stars I often don't know exactly which one to choose, but they are very similar. Anyways, the Little Goat. I enjoyed it so much. Being in Chicago occasionally for business (whish I had the pleasure so much more often, but hey, better than not at all, right?!) I am always interested in enjoyable breakfast joints, because when it's up to me that is my main meal for the day til dinnertime.And being a fan of retro the Little Goat is just ideal. It has leather (fake? real? probably fake, but still classy!) cushioned seats, this time not in wine red, but in sh... (STOP right there!!!) anyways, in brown. They go so far, or rather someone in the past did (and he or she did so often enough!) to cushion the entrance side walls with the stuff. Oh, the 50's (I THINK it is a 50's thing, I am not SURE...). One wonders why the entrance walls, but then again, if you come here to eat on a weekend noonish it makes perfect sense, because plenty of other hungry brunchers stand in line with you and if it happens to be cold outside they won't stand ""in line"" but ""in crowd"" (a heard of little goats?), anyways, you are protected by the cushioned walls from being squeezed against a cold, hard surface. But luckily, alternatively, you can leave the counter people your cell phone number and go for a walk, which is nice, as the wait might be longer than 20 minutes.The food is rich, interesting and I can afford it. Three great things. I would like to put a spotlight on the ""Fat Elvis"" and also upload a photograph, as if I only describe it some of us would not believe it is true. So you get waffles with balls of peanut-butter, syrup, sliced bananas and tiny bacon specks-bits. I have not weighed it all, but as a rough estimate I guess that might be a 1000 calorie breakfast dish. You may think that can't be healthy, but if you eat apples and carrots til dinnertime you probably did yourself some good anyhow, because your soul had so much fun eating it and the psychology of food should NEVER be underestimated in questions of truly healthy nutrition. (If that does not convince: bananas contain plenty of potassium and pork is a great source of  Vitamin B... so there: justified!)There is also a ""Little Goat Bread Bar"" right next to the diner, which is an even weirder place where you can have cocktails with your super-mega-ten(?) layer sandwich for breakfast and be incredibly chique whilst sitting and eating it. There are cities in America where ideas like that might seem way over the top to me, because whilst I appreciate great food I still think other cultural achievements should come first and THEN we wash it down with a latte. In Chicago however a wild bread-bar like this seems just the thing and not out of place, as the city has other cultural enrichment to offer as well, not only food or coffee. Apparently Little Goat has a connection with Stumptown Coffee (sustainable coffee farming) which is certainly worth the thought and praise, and apparently they also have a roof garden, which I have not seen, but I understand you can drink and dance there for New Year, or rent it for your wedding. Cool, sounds very fun.I waited, ate and was definitely satisfied, gladly coming back to do it all again.Oh, one more thing: the wall paper is a psychedelic experience per se, limit staring at it to 2 (in words: ""two"") minutes maximum and only if you come in sober, or you might freeze up and they have to carry you out."
"Great atmosphere, about a 30 min wait on a Sunday evening. Food was nicely varied. We had the breakfast soup (confusing and not great), the pork sandwich (pretty good) and the fried chicken with a biscuit (pretty good, but the biscuit was one of the best I've had)."
"The food doesn't live up to any high expectations or remotely compare to the Girl & the Goat (though it supposed to be the casual diner version, no reservations required). The parathas burrito & fish tostada are both lackluster and on the bland side. The mac & cheese side is decent, but nothing special. The smoked bacon and toffee shake sounded more interesting than it was. It's a decent toffee flavored milkshake, but also not very flavorful, which describes a lot of their dishes. The best thing about dining here is the service, which is spectacular."
"Came here at around 6 on a Saturday and was seated immediately. We just wanted an appetizer/little sampling of food, so we ordered some sides. The Mac and cheese is some of the best I've ever had and the Brussels sprouts were very solid. I'd definitely come back again. Some of the entrees were priced more expensive than I would expect, especially given that it's ala carte, but the flavors are all there. The nachos were huge - definitely more than enough to share and worth the price."
"It was a Sunday morning when I went to Little Goat Diner. This place is really popular, so the wait on Sunday is pretty long. In order to get my table, I had to wait about 45 minutes. After that, the waiter was awesome and the breakfast was amazing. I ordered an Indian flavored breakfast plate and I thought the blend of flavors just melted in your mouth. I also sampled some crab cakes. Those were really good too. The price wasn't too bad, so I feel like going here is worth it. I recommend going at random hours in the day though; the wait is horrible, especially if you're hungry."
"I love this place when it comes to casual dining at any time of the day. It can get a bit loud, so don't expect a quiet intimate environment. For breakfast, I would recommend the Parathas Burrito. I had the shrimp and cheesy grits, which were extremely watery and almost inedible. If you're into sweets for breakfast, then the cinnamon buns are amazing! Grab one before they run out. As far as sandwiches, my hands down favorite is the Rueben. It's a play on the traditional rueben with cooked kimchi in addition to sauerkraut. Pure genius. The Los Drowned and Pork Belly Pancake were also pretty decent."
"Did I already say this place rocks? I had a piece of the little piggy to China breakfast and it made me happy. What made me even happier was the goat burger. Yowzer. Make a reservation, sit outside, put on some stretchy pants and enjoy a meal that is always tasty and with a ton of unique flavors. This and the purple pig are my staples in Chicago."
"Was my first time here and I really enjoyed it. Went at around 330 Ina Saturday and had to wait for 15 minutes for a table, not bad. We ended up with a booth against the wall.My friend and I ordered the ritz crackers with crab dip, the pork belly sandwich, the breaded pork chop sandwich, and the smoked fries and spouts for sides. What...we were hungry! Crab dip was good and cheesy. Sandwiches we spilt in half so we could try both. The pork belly sandwich with slaw on top was fabulous, the flavors worked well together. The breaded pork sandwich was huge. I don't know who would be able to finish that. The breading was light and the bread was soft, good combo. The sides were also great. We shared a whoopie pie for dessert.Our service was okay, she was busy so didn't really check up on us that often. I was done with my drink halfway through my meal, but the place was packed so no biggie and the food was fantastic! Will be back!"
"This is the kind of place where you have to come multiple times to even scratch the surface of the menu. The menu is almost overwhelming in that everything sounds amazing and sadly, you can't have it all. We had a reservation for Sunday breakfast. We were seated at a nice large booth that easily could have twice the size of our party of 4. Although the non breakfast items are served all day, I just couldn't see myself eating a patty melt at 8:30 in the morning, as mouth-wateringly delicious it sounded. Instead I opted for the Fat Elvis waffles which is an excellent choice for a sweet tooth. The generous scoop (I'm talking almost ice cream sized) of peanut butter butter was heavenly. The waffles were nicely chewy and I was very satisfied with the dish. In addition to my waffles, I tried 3 other entrees. The special blue plate of salmon, tomato and clam baguette was delicious. The Korean burger was tasty and the goat party pleasantly gamey. My brother loves loco moco so he tried Little Goat's version with fried rice and sweet and sour sauce. Unfortunately this was the most unsuccessful dish in that it had too much sweet and sour. For all the true loco moco fans out there, stick to the traditional Hawaiian style with white rice and dark gravy. On the table, we shared the special bread and the tempura hash brown. The tempura hash brown was so good, incredibly fluffy on the inside and delicately crispy on the outside. Would definitely recommend. Overall, Little Goat is as good as it gets as far as diners go. Hope to be back many times!"
"Loved it. Everything about it! Attempted to get breakfast here on a Saturday without a reservation (crazy thought, I know) and sure enough, the place was paaacked. I don't dig excessively long waits for brunch. Instead of waiting at the diner, I waded through the sardine-like-packed LG Bakery next door and picked up some bread and baked goods (which were great, and reasonably priced, by the way), and then immediately made a reservation to come back to the diner. It was dinner time, several weeks after my first encounter with the little goat, but I still had their breakfast on the brain. So I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles - I ate the entire dish, and walked out feeling like fat Elvis (a quite happy, fat Elvis, to boot). They were amazing - thick, crispy, and with plenty of luscious peanut butter butter to smear all over them. Topped with sliced banana and maple bacon syzurp. Positively delectable."
"The Little Goat was a fun, casual place to share a nice meal with friends. It has the vibe of an upscale diner, minus the goobs of grease. I do wish the beers were a little bigger, but the selection covered a wide range of varieties. The staff was helpful in choosing from one of their many delicious entries. I had the Korean burger, which was delicious. The fried egg made my trousers tent up a bit. I had some of the chickpea salad. If I wasn't obsessed with carbs and meat, I would highly recommend it. Now, a little something about their dessert. The Turtle Pie was outstanding. I was debating pulling an American Pie and mounting that decadent and voluptuous treat. My denim mountain was still raging but I kept control and scarfed the pie down in under 2 minutes. My girlfriend thinks I should work on my dessert stamina."
"Came here with my coworkers yesterday, after a HUGE craving for a juicy delicious burger.We were relieved that we were seated almost immediately after arriving during lunch rush, which is great since we were on a strict time frame. I got the goat burger patty melt which was really rich and buttery. Think of a grilled cheese sandwich with toast bread and a burger inside. Filled with carmelized onions and dripping american cheese. It was delicious but I was kind of hoping this came with a pretzel bun. If you are grilled cheese sandwich lover, this might be your dream come true"
"I have been following Chef Steph from her Top Chef days and recently on her adventures in Instagram, so when I was at a conference in Chicago, I knew that I needed to do a stop at one of her restaurants. I am an educator on a budget paying my own way from Hawaii and taking care of all my own expenses, so I could not go to her more expensive restaurant but Little Goat is a fun romp with really exceptional food (although a bit salty for my taste). It is definitely family friendly, young people friendly. and as long as you're not trying to have an actual deep discussion, this is a great place for casual dining. I had the breakfast spaghetti with crab and clams that sort of reminded me of egg foo yong with broth until that luscious egg yolk popped once I got to the center of the dish. Yum! The side of pea tendrils was also the perfect balance of fresh, sour, salty, crunchy. When I first brought the pea tendrils to my mouth, I could smell the dirt smell of fresh vegetables, a kind of rawness, but once I tasted it, I thought the tendrils were well cooked, still crunchy but infused with the cooking flavors. Mahalo for a great experience. Kudos to your staff for being very friendly, attentive and passionate about their craft."
"The Bloody Mary I had was awesome, but I only had one since it was $11. I ordered the chicken and French toast, and if I return I will probably order something else. The French toast ended up being a little too soggy for my liking. I will probably return and try something else on the menu. Oh! The rooftop patio is only for private parties, which is a mega bummer."
"Little goat is so stinkin cute. If you go during an off time (maybe around 3 or so) there won't even be a wait. Prices were extremely reasonable and the menu was different and great. I got on sandwich on the bread and we shared fries. I would say it is definitely more diner/comfort food and worth every calorie. This is a great place to go if you have visitors in town and you want them to get the ""Girl and the Goat"" experience but don't want to break the bank. Love love love!"
"The Good:Fresh squeezed orange juice! Good coffee. Menu has a sense of humor! (""cereal killers"" ""sammiches"" ""taters"") Fresh hashbrowns. Fresh homemade breads, bagels, pastries! Beautiful modern, clean, open dining room with open kitchen so you can watch the cooks! The Bad: Expensive prices (cup of fruit was six dollars!!!!!) Heavy food.I don't usually eat breakfast but if I do, I eat pretty light. Kinda hard to find lighter options on this menu, not many egg-less/meatless options....I love pancakes and French toast but all those options seemed overwhelmingly heavy & complex (but were indeed creative)....so I went with sides (fruit, bagel, hashbrowns)The Food: Hashbrowns are freshly grated to order and come automatically with cheese (I got mine without, as a light breakfast eater) -- portion was huuuge and the hashbrowns were for some reason so long I had to twirl them like spaghetti around my fork!  Breakfast was definitely fresh, yummy, and filling. The Service: Professional, courteous, efficient, fast, coffee refilled, -- no complaints!Overall:Not cheap but hopefully worth it! I like the creativity, freshness and homemadeness. Nice modern restaurant, clean and bustling, pleasant atmosphere, good service, good coffee, good food. Recommended if you want to drop some cash on breakfast! Next time I go I'll try to be more hungry!"
"You have to love a trendy, top chef diner that serves some of the more creative breakfast dishes all day long. I seriously love breakfast, so the fact that this place a) will serve me breakfast all day and b) they will serve me breakfast dishes I would never think to make at home myself ever, makes this place a winner for me. Their shrimp and ""grumpy"" goat grits is a must order. I do love me some grits, and that dish is solid every time. And the pork belly pancake which is a scallion pancake served with yes, PORK BELLY, with some hoisin and bok choy and some ginger dressing, this thing was a perfect late night breakfast like snack for me. Perfect. Not the largest portion in the world, would be my only ""pork"" with it (get it? not beef? ha ha)The korean burger was also pretty great--served with kimchi and bacon and spicy sauce. It was juicy and tasty and is another reason why the fusion menu here between classic American dishes with a little Asian fusion flare works so well for my tastebuds. It can be a long wait here, but they do their best to pump out fresh food as quickly as they can. And there is so much I want to come back and try!"
"This place is GREAT. Hip and delicious. I had the fish tostadas.  I wish I had the chance to eat here all the time, but I'm a Californian....Make a reservation if you have the foresight.  Otherwise, go on in and they'll seat you at a nice community table.  Service is ultra fast and friendly."
"We ate here around 2pm. Diner was pretty full, but we only had to wait a couple minutes. My sister lives here in Chicago, and she said the wait was too long, so she hasn't been able to dine here. I ordered the braised beef sandwich. I originally wanted the bbq pulled pork sandwich, but they weren't serving that. Maybe we went too early. The bottom of my bun was super wet and somewhat soggy, but I wonder if that's how it's supposed to be. It was really good. Very messy to eat though. My BF ordered the sourdough pancakes, and he LOVED it. I thought they were average, but I don't love pancakes like he does.Service was great. Everyone was nice. The inside of the diner was super classy. but we were just dressed casual. It's a fancy diner vibe, but you don't have to dress up really. But for the most part, everyone in Chicago is usually pretty dressed up. A lot different from Minnesota. Bathrooms were good. LOVED the hand dryer.. felt like a hand massage. Overall, I liked this place, and would recommend and return here."
"I've been wanting to come here ever since it opened since I loved Girl and the Goat and I finally got the chance a few weeks ago. Originally wanted to try to get a reservation for brunch on opentable but could never find a spot. So my friends and I just decided to arrive at 10:30am on a Sunday and hope for the best. We ended up waiting about 30 minutes which wasn't too bad. I got the pork belly pancake and shared a side of hash browns with my friend. The pork belly was cooked very well and I really liked the bok choy salad and dressing that came with it. I was a little disappointed with the scallion pancake part of it though since it wasn't as flavorful as I was hoping and would usually expect for a scallion pancake. The hashbrowns were very well made with just the right about of crispy and potatoey goodness. Overall, I really enjoyed it and would want to come again just to try all the other creative dishes on the menu."
First time here with a couple cousins and what can I say. It all started when I walked in the host was very kind sat us down our waiter was awesome described the menus for us and answered all our questions. The all American burger was awesome. Macho nachos were awesome good appetizer. Also the lamb ribs were delicious with the touch of strawberries. Definitely would come back soon
"I went to Girl and the Goat first. Which was maybe the problem. It didn't  live up to expectations. This place is very busy, pretty much all the time.  Which isnt bad on its own. But the service tends to be inattentive as a result.  I wasnt blown away by the food, but it was okay.   Cocktails are good.  Get the yoda juice, bam!  The bakery is ridiculously awesome. Check that out"
"A diner with 5-star food, that's a little different.  The wait's usually pretty long, but you can go next door for coffee (excellent), a drink, or a speciality bread."
"As if this place needs another review! I made a lunch reservation a few days in advance (no problem getting an 11:30 on a Friday) and came in with my boss. We loved the diner feel and were happy to have one of the small tables rather than sitting at a communal table (call us anti-social, whatever). It wasn't long before we were watching a crowd accumulate at the door!Looking at the menu was an overwhelming experience because everything looks delish. I chose the soup of the day, a strawberry gazpacho (!!) and the fish tostadas. Really, there aren't enough words to describe how awesome they were. The pictures just don't do them justice. There was a little heat with the gazpacho, but it was still sweet like you'd expect. The tostadas were incredible as well; just the right amount of fish, guacamole, and other toppings. My plan (and my suggestion): lunch at Little Goat (with a reservation), make sure it's up your alley, then try Girl & the Goat for dinner. I'm just mustering up enough patience to wait for a table there."
"I've been to Little Goat 3 times now and have loved it each time. I love the quirky old school, yet modern diner feel of Little Goat. I was here dining on Monday for one of my gf's birthdays.  First, our waitress could't be any nicer (shout out to said waitress whose name escapes me at the moment). For drinks: I can't say too much because I opted for a Pinot Noir. It was yummy...pretty standard red wine.Apps: Oh dear god. Mac n' cheese...YES PLEASE! Creamy white cheddar magic served up in a little bowl. Definitely a must. Also amazing to note: the brussel sprouts. Brussel sprouts you're thinking, ewe. But no, not ewe. They were stir fried in a delicious almond sauce with just a hint of garlic. ahhhhMain course: Feeding my inner 6 year old, I chose the tuna melt. I mean hey, I already had the mac n' cheese I may as well throw in an old fashioned classic sandwich. So it was the sandwich of the week. Yay right? Well kind of...the tuna salad itself was AWESOME! Supahh fresh....BUT it came with some sort of cheese sauce. I guess I really wasn't sure what I was expecting, seeing as the menu literally says ""cheese sauce"", but it was just way messier/creamy that I had imagined and it made the overall feel of the sandwich very HEAVY. Honestly, it was good, just don't expect to do ANYTHING the rest of the day because this tuna melt will down right fatigue you. blehDessert: Our super fun and kind waitress hooked the bday girl up with a little shake (on the house) for her special day. How cute right!? We also ordered the turtle pie to split...which came with a birthday candle and all:) DAMN, this was OUT OF THIS WORLD! If you LOVE carmel, then go to Little Goat this very second and order the turtle pie. oooweeee.   PLEASE READ: Stay out of Little Goat's BS photo booth. We thought it would be a fun way to end the night and capture the moment, but turns out it was just an evil money hungry machine that takes crappy pictures. Pro tip: save your $5 and order an extra Mac n' cheese instead.Don't worry Little Goat, I will not let your broke a** photo booth taint me from coming in again and again....you're food is just too good to pass up;)"
"Over-hyped in my opinion. I feel like they are trying TOO hard to make food different and have an edge. We had the Skirt Steak salad with a weird salted caramel dressing. I could have done without the dressing. We had a side of fries that were mediocre, the chicken fingers were dry. The only good thing there was the french toast. I didn't try the whole menu obviously, just was not really impressed with this place."
"I mean, yes, it's pretty tasty - and sure, being able to order tempura mashed potatoes, bbq pork, crumpets, and a bagel with kimchi schmear all in one locale is kind of fun - I give it props for deviating from the traditional brunch script - but once you get of get over the ""omgggg I'm so bad with my dark chocolate crunch pancakes and guanciale + gouda grilled cheese"", it's kind of like, yeah, it's better than average, but certainly not worth the 1-2.5h wait. Like. Other great food exists in the West Loop that will allow you to happily consume enough calories that you'll have to double down w your trainer the next day.Strolled in for our 1:30p res - and while I had thought I was being too neurotic by actually booking a place for our city brunch date, thank effing G-d that I did - on a random Monday, there was a 1.5h wait for a party of two - so yes, take a page from my book and get your shizz together at least the night before and give them a ring or else be prepared to get hangry.Space is clean, bright, and hip - bustling, though noise is tolerable - we were both feeling lunchy so we hit the chickpea/kale salad, an Asiany salad w mandolined veg + shrimp, an order of the brussels as well as some smoked fries. Table next to us got the fat elvis waffles (nana, peanut butter, bacon maple syrup) and I realized I had ordered wrong and was sad-face. Smoked fries needed salt. And to be thicker. Kale salad was the winner - but my Asian adventure was too small for an entree - and certainly short on shrimp (3 per salad does not really do it for me), making its $14 tag seem inflated. Better calls seem to be the burgers (beef, goat, or veggie), with any of the set-ups, the fried pickles, or the hot crab dip.Brunch for two with wine, tea, salads, and sides was $65 w tip - most entrees were $14-18 and while portions were generally fine, everything seemed $1-2 more than necessary. House wine is not tasty, but the Stumptown roast is. Overall, if you're looking for something a little different, it's good - but the hype is overkill. It's basically just carbs and fat. Not rocket science."
"If you're looking for a good, filling meal and can't find a seat at Girl & the Goat, then head across the street to Little Goat!Been here a few times, and each time is such a great experience.  The food is bombdotcom; I always order an order of the chili cheese fries (because it's honestly some of the best I've ever had), and another dish (yes, I am a fat ass).  The crab dip is also awesome--the richness of the dip, the buttery, flaky Ritz crackers..ugh.  Drooling just thinking about it.  The tiramisu milkshake made me a believer in milkshakes again.  Usually you get the same old flavors at many restaurants: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, maybe a cookies n' cream thrown in there.  But at Little Goat?  They go above and beyond what any other restaurant would.Service: holy balls it has the most impeccable service I've seen anywhere other than at a fine dining restaurant.  Friends and I were running low on crackers for our crab dip.  Server notices it literally from across the room, grabs the crackers from the kitchen, and brings them our way.  It's AWESOME knowing that the servers are always keeping an eye on you, even when they're away from your table!Love this place.  You bet your ass I'll be seeing you again, Little Goat!"
"Truly awesome.  Wonderful service and amazing food.The Little Goat has best Bloody Mary I've ever had.  Who knew that Kimchi would be great in a drink?!I shared an order of the corned beef hash which was wonderful.  The hash was sliced so thin, like angel hair pasta, which made it super crispy.  The corned beef has the perfect amount of salt.  So perfectly savory!  We also had a biscuit on the side which was perfect flaky but didn't fall apart.Our server was wonderful and attentive.  I will be back here on my next visit to Chicago for sure!"
"What can I say you have not already heard? Fun menu, really nice servers and great tasting food. Totally winning combination. Sunday night walked in at 7:30 PM, and it was a 35 minute wait so we walked over to Little Goat Bread and were served our meal at the bar. Full menu, very knowledgeable bartender.We'll definitely be back to taste other interesting items on the menu."
We're a huge fan of this place. I mean...breakfast/ brunch any time of the day is always a winner in my book. I've had several standout dishes here including: Fall Harvest Chicken saladFish Toastadas (YUM)Fun & Crispy Chicken sandwich We will definitely be back again and again!
"The goat chili fries were really really good. I recommend those!The Bulls eye french toast was good on the first bite but after that like some others have said it just gets to be a very weird taste. I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be a sunny side egg in the middle that would break the egg yolk all over, instead it was an almost cooked egg with no runny egg yolk. I don't know it was just kind of odd tasting and each bite got more unpleasant.Update: it is really frustrating when I leave an honest review, then the manager sends me a message offering for me to return to give the restaurant another try and specifies which email to contact them at, and when I do contact them I get no response. Sending a private message does not make anything better without acting upon what was said. Otherwise don't even bother to reach out."
"What a bomb! The BREAKFAST SPAGHETTI 'N CLAMS 'N CRAB was amazing. Ask for their hot sauces. The apricot/habanero sauce is to die for. Excellent ambiance, good service. Fantastic meal."
"Easier to get into than its sister restaurant, Girl and the Goat. We came from Saturday breakfast as a walk in and despite the chaos at the hostess stand, we didn't wait long to get seated. The food was good, but it's not what I was looking for. Breakfast, especially, weekend breakfast should be filling, savory and decadent. There wasn't anything wrong with our meals (3 Little Pigs and Blueberry Pancakes), but it wasn't ""breakfast."" The flavors were just a bit over the top and a bit too complex for me. Others, I'm sure, would disagree. Different strokes, right? The staff in general seemed disinterested and uninvolved. A great diner is constantly asking if you need more coffee. We aren't asked once. Kinda strange. Overall, Little Goat was fine, but nothing exceptional."
"Did you know you can get married here?  You can, and it is awesome. It's a great restaurant and I think the other reviews can speak to that, but after attending a pig roast on the roof deck last summer, my then fiancee, now wife, and I decided we'd look into getting married in the event space upstairs.  The entire team we worked with were class acts and really went out of their way for us.  If I ever get married again, I'm doing it here.There was no charge for the space, we just met a food and beverage minimum.  The food pricing was extremely reasonable for the caliber of food you're getting, and  the space holds about 70 people for passed hors d'oeuvres.  We also had several stationary dishes, but it wasn't a seated service.They came up with a Cap'n crunch based cake for us, and 3 signature cocktails (something new, borrowed, and blue).  Our bartender worked his butt off, and his work was felt by everyone that night and the next morning.If, on the off chance you're NOT getting married right now, go get the BBQ pork sandwich and some goat fries."
"Love the decor, the place and the food. I was too full and I couldnt finish my food. I dont think they like people not finishing their plates, i dont know probably that is only my feeling. It is an upscale diner. If you are looking for a cheap , simple good diner this is not the place."
"Sigh. After thinking about my last few times at LGD, I had some great highs and some pretty sad lows. I adore everything Stephanie Izard, so it pains me to have gripes about her restaurant. Okay guys, here's the lowdown. First off, please understand that I am a lover of all things savory so most items on their menu just sings to my appetite. However, I found their cheesy hashbrowns to be pretty much inedible due to the amount of salt in them. Same story for their grilled cheese, which happens to contain my favorite pork cheek. SIGH.Ok, not everything at Little Goat is a giant salt lick so don't worry. Their crispy chicken, tonkatsu, Reuben, and sloppy goat sandwiches are all amazing and have a perfect balance of flavors and textures. The top two sandwich priorities in my book if you ask me. Making reservations for Little Goat is way easier than Girl & the Goat, so this place is definitely still worth a shot. Will have to report back when I finally have their breakfast."
"Finally i'm going to review this way long overdue place. Stephanie Izard's 2nd location. What a bomb location. This place gets busy pretty quickly, but my gf and I were able to get seated really quickly as another couple just left. LUCKY USThe waiter was pretty cool. He was friendly. I had the Little Goat Coffee, which was yummy... it is supplied with goat milk, so it has that off taste, but if you are used to it, then do not fret. BREAKFAST SPAGHETTI 'N CLAMS 'N CRAB - least favorite dish of the place. My gf wanted this since she loves her pasta, but ehhh. Spaghetti, with eggs, clams and crab just sounds weird right? I mean it was very runny. At 1st i wasn't even sure what this dish was because the egg and spaghetti was cooked together so it just looked funky. Wasn't a fan.KIMCHEE & BACON & EGGS & PANCAKES ASIAN STYLE BREAKFAST TASTY THING YESSSSSS YESSSS YESSS Thank you Stephanie for making something so comforting out of Korean ingredients. This was awesome. It was sweet, salty, sour, crunchy, soft. She just nailed it on this dish. The Reuben was another winner. smoked corned beef . kimchi . kraut . havarti .  special sauce . pretzel rye..It was greasy goodness.Everything will elicit a food coma so beware. Get full and be ready to sleep off the rest of your day.Def coming back here if I'm ever back in Chicago.Top Chef season 4 winner shows why she deserved to win. Solid comfort food at its finest."
"It really bums me out that after a year and a half of visits to Little Goat, I'm not seeing a reason to return anytime soon.We used to come around on rare special occasion visits, but a jump up in income has led us to eating nicer meals out more often.  We've been to Little Goat probably 5 times in the last 8 months, and every experience has been subpar at best.  I kept coming back because the food is really good (and I stand by that -- the food is really good) but prices have steadily climbed and the service has steadily declined.Our most recent experience was the nail in the coffin.  Little Goat accepts reservations from the non-specials now, so we booked ourselves a table for weekend brunch.  Arriving right on time, the indifferent hostess told us no tables were available and offered us seats at the counter.  I thought the purpose of a reservation was having a table reserved?  We wound up taking a table on the patio, which was operating thanks to the 60sish weather we were having.  Our server was clearly asleep at the wheel and unable to handle his workload -- it took a long time for him to acknowledge us (and after acknowledging tables sat after us), and the only reason we received our coffee within 20 minutes of us sitting down was due to a hostess that stopped by to ask if we wanted anything.   I wanted to give our server the benefit of the doubt, but from there it only worsened (to the point that I had to go inside Little Goat Bread to secure sugar for our americanos, as we were left with cream and a sugar substitute).  I wish I had asked for a manager, but by the end of the meal I was tired and just wanted to leave.Unfortunately, the most recent experience mimics almost all of our previous ones over the last few months.  Little Goat seems poorly managed from a front of house standpoint; servers must have too many tables or something because they tend to disappear and then you're having to flag down a different server or a busboy to get your check/your dessert/more coffee.  Sitting at the counter is exceptionally bad as your server tends to be too concerned with the larger tables than the two people they have sitting by the kitchen.  I think my love affair with Little Goat is over.  At least Girl & the Goat still rocks it."
"I am proud to say that I live in Chicago and Chef Stephanie Izard calls Chicago home. I have been here several times different times of the day and Little Goat Diner has not yet let me down. Just last weekend I told Chef Izard I might be a little obsessed with Little Goat Diner. It must be the Fat Elvis Waffles. Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast, Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup, Smoked Fries, Sloppy Goat Sandwich, Tonkatsu Sandwich, Goat Almighty Burger, Carmel Apple Shakes, Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch Shakes, and Duck Fat Bread (seriously). Yeah I have had all that and more! You cannot get into Girl & the Goat. Just come here and you will be happy that you did. Average wait during prime dinner hours is over an hour so get here before 5pm. Average wait during prime lunch hours during the week is the same at an hour so get here before 11:30am. If you can, make reservations via Yelp cause life is easier when they have a table waiting for you. If any point you have to wait, go to the Little Goat Bread side and wait. Or if you have to wait for your Girl & the Goat table just swing by. They have a full bar and coffee bar there. As you walk in, the place is a throw back in time. You can see the open kitchen and if you are really lucky see Chef Izard getting into what she does best. Folks that work here are always awesome from the host to the servers. Not only they know their stuff on what's on the menu through and through. They are just cool people even on the busiest days. The food is just awesome. Serving breakfast all day long through late night you can get anything on the menu until they run out. Try the Sloppy Goat Sandwich or Goat Almighty Burger with a side of Smoked Fries. The shakes are stupendous as well including the Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch Shake. Just close your eyes and try it. You will taste the amazing smoky and sugar toffee crunch of amazingness. If you want a grownup shake, they can make they happen by putting a shot of liquor in any shake you please. Need a caffeine lift? Little Goat Diner is one of a few places in Chicago that serves up Portland's Stumptown Coffee. Make sure you try a cup of The Little Goat - Stumptown Coffee with Goats Milk. In the summer months, outdoor seating opens as well as the roof opens for dining. With Little Goat Diner's seasonal menu, you have to come here a few times a year to really experience Little Goat Diner. Bring your friends, bring a date, or just stop in for a drink. This place has plenty to offer. Food - 5Décor - 5Service - 5"
"Great atmosphere, delicious cocktails, and addictive food. The service was great, our server really knew the menu and was ready to recommend something from any part of the menu. We stared with the pizza bread, I could not get enough of the stewed tomato sauce. For entrees, two of us got the veggie burger and I got the Korean burger. The veggie burger patty had identifiable veggies, which we loved, though the patties had a little trouble staying together, but they were very flavorful!  The Korean burger was amazing, the egg was cooked perfectly and really reminded me of a Bim Bop! Next time, I'd go with the beef or chicken patty over the goat though, I felt that the goat patty took away from the overall burger. I will definitely be back!"
"I will be back. Must try everything. Shared the macho nachos and the chips were especially amazing. Then tried the Goat Almighty. Can't say I had it, because I only got through a small piece of it. Need to come here hungry. This burger was a tower of meat and stuff. I had to lay it down. Got through the goat burger, which was awesome, and the tortilla with jalapenos at the bottom. My friend took the rest home to her bottomless pit of a husband.Service was great and so was the beer list. Again, I will be back."
Food: Just amazing. Everything you want this type of place to be. Food was so good. Topper...well priced for the quality. Staff: was a bit slow but friendly and it was busy. DLooks: best in the biz.All in all a must go.
"Looks, smells, feels like a diner. Even the menu resembles a diner, but everything has a nice tasty twist. I start salivating just thinking about Little Goat. Their Elvis Waffles, with PB, Chocolate, Bananas and BACON is to die for. Think about all of those ingredients, mixed together in every bite. Then there's their Pork Belly, Korean Pancake, which although the belly is very rich, is balanced with some great slaw and a bready pancake. The only let down that night was maybe the mac and cheese, which was a little runny.LGD is one of those places where you look at the menu and you just cannot decide. I can't wait to come back to LGD the next time I'm in town!"
"From outside, this diner looks standard, but the asian influenced casual diner fare is anything but.   My girlfriend had the ""little piggy went to china"" and our friend had some ""asian breakfast thing.""  Throughout the meal, I found myself not believing my tastebuds -- flavors that I would have never dreamed of putting together (blackberry and chorizo, fried spaghetti and coffee) were revelations."
"Great restaurant located in the West Loop. I've been to the Girl and the Goat and while it was awesome, I definitely wanted try the diner across the street. The first time I went, it was for an event during TechWeek. There was a happy hour on the roof with a bunch of different appetizers and they were all very delicious. The scallops were fantastic as well as the empanadas. I went to eat at the bar with a buddy of mine a couple of months after and I had the Goat Almighty burger. It was huge and awesome! There were so many others things I wanted to try and I'll be back soon to do just that."
"Only stopped in briefly for a quick mid day snack. I ordered the biscuits and gravy and was not disappointed. Very fast service, friendly staff, and beautiful mid-century diner decor."
"I have a group of girlfriends from college, with whom i participated on the mock trial team (shut up, I've embraced the nerditude) with whom I have brunch every few months. They're both still living in the city and far more city-savvy than I am, and for our last brunch, one of them insisted on Little Goat Diner. The other gal is celiac and saw they had a gluten free menu, and I had been dying to try one of Stephanie Izard's restaurants for ages, so we were all on board. I made a reservation for 9AM last Saturday morning and waited in eager anticipation of an amazing brunch.We got there and were seated right away at our booth. The coffee is delicious and I love the enormous heavy coffee mugs with their little goat painted inside. The breakfast selections are not infinite but made up an entire page of the menu. The selections seem to go one of two ways: perfectly ordinary, or so wacky I can't imagine eating it. For instance, the ""brandade and belly"" caught my eye because I love, love, love pork belly - but a quick google search of what ""brandade"" is and I was too weirded out to try it. I settled on the spiced apple pancakes, one friend got the dark chocolate crunch pancakes, and the friend with celiac opted for the gluten-free pancakes from the gluten-free menu. Our server paused and said she may not be able to have those, because they tend to sell out quick, so she'd run and check and come back. Okay, fair.  5 minutes later she came back and advised yes, they do have them - BUT, was she gluten-free or actually celiac? When my friend advised she does actually have celiac's disease, our server told us she would not be able to eat these pancakes, because of cross-contamination.So, I get it. I wouldn't risk serving someone with a serious food allergy something that could make her very sick. But why do they have a gluten free menu if they can't serve the items to people who aren't choosing to be gluten free, but HAVE to be? Seems a little silly. My friend had been so excited to peruse an entire menu of stuff she COULD eat, and then to find out she couldn't, was a bummer. Friend ordered a gluten free corned beef hash and we waited for our food.My pancakes were gooooorgeous - a big stack of pancakes with apple slices baked right in, with a delicious oatmeal crumble on top. The flavor was delicious, but I couldn't help thinking they were kind of average - something I would have been able to get anywhere. I also got a side of bacon, which was small and greasy. Friends enjoyed their meals, but nobody cleaned their plate.Breakfast was very reasonably priced and I am SO GLAD we made a reservation because as we were leaving, we could barely slip out of our booth because there were people EVERYWHERE waiting to get seated. I don't know that I'd return to Little Goat, but I still want to try Girl & the Goat, which I'm certain would be even better."
"Had dinner here a couple months ago. Food was awesome. Service was impeccable and I had a great time chatting with some other people at the bar. Good food, good time, and good people. What more do you need? NOM NOM NOM GO HERE!"
Tempura fried mashed potatoes.I am tempted to leave this review right now with a mic drop because they were that damn good.  Everything from top to bottom was wonderful. It's cozy and eclectic to just the right balance. I got a pork belly on a scallion pancake with an Asian slaw - it was lick your plate awesome. I could probably eat here seven days a week - and never get bored.
"I've had breakfast dishes a number of times here and sandwiches a few times too. Everything has been great. Well executed diner classics, usually with a twist."
"Oh my good gracious why have I waited so long to come thru... Honestly, I loved it so much that I went with my friend and then my boyfriend less than a week later.Stopped in with a friend on a Saturday and got a table outside.  Ordered cinnamon rolls to start (which were MASSIVE!) and then the little piggy went to China for my entree. My friends main dish came out and the runner noted that mine would be out momentarily.  Unfortunately, this turned into about a 20 minute waiting period (chili sauce ran out?) Server and two managers were very apologetic and ended up hooking us both up with a cocktail (vodka soda for me and a bloody for my friend)So, as a previous server, things happen w/e.. and ultimately everything was taken care of and I was extremely pleased with our experience.When I went with my man, it was a calmer monday and we sat at a table inside. Service was good, food was great, and they had Zombie Dust on tap so like what is not to love!"
"Came here for an early morning brunch and was not disappointed. I had the Fat Elvis Waflles with peanut butter butter, maple syrup, and bacon which was quite good. My husband had the patty melt. We also shared a fresh squeezed OJ. We had a reservation and we were seated promptly. We found street parking very near by. It's not the very best brunch I've ever had, but it's definitely a great spot!"
"After being told by many people that this was the spot to hit for great eats - I was sadly disappointed by the quality of the food, the staff and presentation. When we arrived, there were several dirty tables sitting with no attention and we were told that there was a 90 min wait. After taking a walk for about an 1.5 hrs, we were finally seated. My friend heard that the grilled cheese was amazing - so we both ordered one and I also added the chocolate pancakes. The grilled cheese was sad - hardly any cheese and overly cooked bread and a few tomatoes. For $10-12 for a grilled cheese, I would have expected some cheese, at least. The chocolate pancakes didn't taste like chocolate at all. They really had 0 taste. I could have made Nutella pancakes at home and saved myself some money. Overall, the entire meal was flavorless and very disappointing. The ambiance was noisy. It took forever to get a coca-cola and a refill. By then, we were ready to just leave."
"I've been for breakfast and lunch, everything has been very good.  Some menu items are a bit out of my tastes but the chickpea salad for lunch is amazing.  Biscuits for breakfast, pancakes, bakery, very good!  Service is friendly as well."
"If we were talking about ourselves in terms of Little Goat or G&G, I'd definitely be more of a Little Goat kind of a girl. You're more likely to find me in a diner or hole in the wall than in a fancy schmancy restaurant of any sort. Not only can I admit that, I am definitely okay with it. I guess that's why I LOVED Little Goat so much. It's a fresh take on a diner. It's different and new but it's not pretentious.We found ourselves stopping at the Little Goat coffee shop a few times during our weekend stay in the city. They had lots of different options and I got to try both their hot cider and their coffee. On the Sunday that we were leaving, we also stopped off at the diner for breakfast after a night long of partying. It was the perfect end to our weekend. The mister went with the parathas burrito and I ordered the corned beef hash with egg & a side of grits. The burrito was like a breakfast burrito but had more veggies and fresh ingredients than what you could expect from McDonalds or any fast food joint. The arugula on top really won me over. Mine was divine too. I'm a big fan of corned beef and hash and although their interpretation wasn't really anything new, it was lucious and melt in your mouth delicious. The grits were the best I've found outside of the South. They were very cheesy which made them even better.Our meal at Little Goat was more than we'd spend on breakfast normally, but it was worth every dollar."
"Food is ok, everything on the menu is super heavy and unhealthy. It has a cool feel but was really loud and hard to have a conversation."
"This was my first time at the Little Goat, and I was not disappointed. I had made a reservation for 645 pm on a Sunday night but I wanted to bump it up to accommodate plans for later in the night. I was able to easily change the time for that Sunday night. The restaurant is nicely decorated with a mix of clean lines and retro wallpaper prints. We started the night (of gluttony) with a beer, followed by an order of the crab dip between myself and my boyfriend. I decided on the Grilled cheese with pork for dinner, while the other half ordered the pork belly pancake. We then decided we needed to try the goat chili cheese fries as well. As a last minute decision, the man friend decided we ALSO needed to try to tempura mashed potatoes. Good thing he ordered them as the waiter walked away as I would have nixed that idea.But good thing I didn't. Because everything we ordered for dinner was perfect. My grilled cheese was the perfect blend of meat, cheese, and tomato, and his pancake was fantastic. The chili tasted like it had hints of cinnamon to it, and the mashed potato tempura was light while also giving us that comfort food feel of mashed potato. The pork belly pancake felt like it was lacking on the amount of actual meat for the portion;  (even I, the fake vegetarian thought there should have been more pork) you had to hunt under the vegetables on top to find the meaty goodness.Because I am also a sucker for ice cream, we opted to get the toffee and pork belly shake to go. We had a hard time decided between that and the pumpkin flavored shake but as the pork/toffee combo seemed more unique we opted for that.Our server Carl was incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. The entire wait staff was timely in clearing dishes and refilling water. I will definitely be back."
"Little Goat has exactly the kind of comfort diner food I was looking for one day, only kicked up a notch with creativity as you'd expect from Stephanie Izard. The place itself is also casual, kinda kitschy and nice - especially for a dinner. We came here at 5:30 one day and the place was practically empty which was surprising, but it was almost full by the time we left. We started with the noodle wrapped shrimp which was delish - big juicy shrimp and great, crunchy texture from the noodles. I had the korean burger with kimchee, bacon and egg, and the flavors were amazing. My only complaint is that it practically fell apart when I picked it up and the bun was rather soggy towards the end, but it was tasty regardless. My husband had the pork belly pancake - he said it was good but not super memorable. He also ordered a side of the mac and cheese which he devoured. My favorite part was dessert - oh my god, this dessert, I'm still thinking about it. It sounds like the desserts are made next door in the bakery and available at the diner. We opted for a turtle mini pie (easily split between two people). It had what seemed like an oreo cookie crust, filled with cashews soaked in caramel, and topped with whip cream. When I type it out, it sounds so simple and does not do it justice, it was the highlight of the meal. Most notable was the waitstaff - very welcoming and attentive; our waiter was great at keeping an eye on us and making small talk but not hovering. We'll definitely be back - I'm coming for you, turtle pie."
"Writing this a year after our visit but I've been dreaming of these meals ever since! Dinner and then breakfast here the next morning. Dinner was one of my favorite salads ever---THE CHICKPEA: think of a falafel plus chicken here. kale . chopped veggies . montamore cheese . tzatziki . chee vinaigrette . And add the chicken. I love me some fancied up oatmeal and breakfast was out of this world--OATMEALtopped with honey yogurt, apple cider reduction and oat crumble (offered only until 11am so rise and shine for this one). Every future visit to Chicago will include meals at this gem!"
"Arrived here at 0900 on Labor Day and my party of two was seated in about 5 min at the counter.  I love diners and Little Goat plays up that diner feel but in a sleeker and brighter way. It took a while for anyone to acknowledge that we had been seated and just when I was going to flag someone down, someone came by with coffee, filled up the cute goat mug, asked if I liked sugar and cream and then left. But...but...cream? please? After that initial hiccup, service was much smoother. My sidekick and I opted for the chocolate chip pancakes (him), omelet of the day (me) and a side of bacon (us!). The omelet of the day was a Crab Rangoon omelet. Basically an omelet with crab rangoon filling, topped with sweet and sour sauce and fried won tons. I debated because I love crab rangoon, but the thought of  sweet omelet turned me off. Our server assured me that the sweet/sour is very subtle and he was spot on. It was well made, the filling was just enough and the flavors went well together. The chocolate chip pancakes--this was a huge portion. Three chocolate pancakes studded with chocolate crispies and served with chocolate malt butter.  My son was content with just dipping pieces of the pancake in the chocolate butter so the syrup that was brought out was forgotten.  He was so right, that's all the pancake needed, just a bit of that chocolate butter.  Delicious! and chocolate butter? Ingenious!  This was a huge portion so leftovers were appreciated at home later for dinner. The bacon was good, not as crispy as I'd like so make sure you ask for crispy if that's how you prefer it. And a HUGE shout out to the servers that stopped by to talk to my son. You all totally made him feel like a rock star, giving him high fives, talking to him about Green Lantern (yes, he brought the action figure to breakfast with us), asking him how he was doing.  He was impressed with Little Goat so much he brought the Little Goat kiddie cup to preschool the next day and just kind of showed it off telling his little friends that he went to a restaurant with a ""goat on the roof"". I have been a fan of Chef Izard for a while, looks like she has a new little fan now!"
"Came after the lunch rush and had the Mighty Goat. This burger was massive and I gotta say this is one daunting looking burger. For the meat loving carnivores, this one is for you! For me it was a fork and knife experience as I would not even try picking it up. So many layers of flavors and textures in there. Sitting at the counter and watching all the various plates of awesome food leave the kitchen, you cannot help but begin planning what to get on your next visit. Post dinner cappuccino well made and a nice way to round off a satisfying meal. I'm glad that I managed to stop by and hope to visit at least once more before leaving Chicago. Come hungry and be well fed!"
"If you're going to reinvent the wheel as they say...the wheel better be perfect to begin with...It wasn't.My friends and I stopped in for early dinner on a Saturday.  We had reservations, but it didn't seem terribly busy to begin with.  We ordered the nachos, pork belly pancake, and a Korean burger.   We also had the smoked fries, garlic mashed potatoes, and tempura mashed potatoes.  For dessert, we shared the Betterfinger sundae.Ok...first the nachos were the best thing we ate.  By far.  We should have just stuck with those.  Homemade chips, barbeque pork...they were loaded with toppings and just deliciuos.The rest of the food didn't fare so well.  The pork belly pancake was good..in theory.  But there wasn't enough pork belly!  By the end, I had eaten all the pork, had eaten most of the pancake (which was tasty...) but seriously had over a cup of the slaw left.  They pile on all the slaw to hide the fact there is hardly any meat!  My friend ate his burger, said it was ok, but far from the best he'd ever had.Now lets get to the sides.  The fries were ""smoked"" with a nacho cheese seasoning.  Where?  No smoke, no nacho seasoning.  Just mediocre fries. Room temperature and greasy, not light and crisp.  Like the oil wasn't hot enough when they were fried, so they got saturated with oil.   McDonalds fries taste better.  Seriously, and that's SAD.Garlic mashed potatoes were...garlic mashed.  Taste like the ones at Applebees.  Which is not a bad thing...I like the garlic mashed potatoes at Applebees.  But I'm not expecting them at Little Goat, because I certainly wasn't getting a 2 for $20 special here...and now let's get to those tempura mashed potatoes.  These weren't just outside the box.  After leaving the box, who ever came up with this concept proceeded to take said box they were now outside of, and launch it into outer space.  It was like mashed potatoes, deep fried, with an asian flair.  Uh....ok, maybe I can go with this concept, but then it's paired with ranch (great, I love ranch, but not necessarily with Asian-inspired flavors) and then went with a rather unpleasant-tasting ""barbeque"" sauce, and I am being kind.    I'm sorry, I don't know what this was, but it tasted like watered-down ketchup, mixed with Arby's sauce packets, then mixed with a whole lot of vinegar.  We all were not fans.And now to dessert.  It was ok.  Nothing memorable.  Very small, but that was to be expected.  The best part were those chocolate covered cheese crackers and there wasn't enough of those!  So I was disappointed.  Again.  Ok, so I tried Girl and the Goat (wasn't impressed) , and tried Little Goat and was even less impressed.  Eh.  Next time I'll just go to Applebees, and stop off at the grocery store, get some ice cream, cheese crackers, melt some chocolate down, make my own chocolate cheese crackers, dump as much as I want into my sundae and call it a day."
"This was my first time at The Little Goat and it didn't start off very well.   I made a reservation for a mid-afternoon lunch via OpenTable (which showed they had plenty of availability) and they didn't have our reservation when we arrived.  The waiting area was packed and we were offered to wait in the bar and they would text me when our table was ready.    We probably waited about 20 min when the host came and got us. After this mishap, the rest of the experience went very well.  The ambiance is unique, urban-hip restaurant blend of a  mom and pop diner offering unique twists on classic diner meals with Mexican, Asian, etc. flares.    After reading many great reviews exclaiming wonderful nachos, that I wanted to try them out myself.   They were definitely not traditional nachos, but they were tasty.   Very little meat (maybe 2 oz) on the dish I was served and it was hidden at the bottom of the plate.  I can not say I will order them again, but I definitely want to come back to try some of the other dishes on the  menu and those I say other customers ordered."
"After having a meal here I accidentally left my David Yurman ring on the hand dryer in the bathroom.  I called immediately when I realized it was missing, as I had just left and was at City Winery, they told me to enjoy my show as someone had turned in the ring and it was being placed in their safe until I could come claim it.  This said, someone in house then took the ring and when I came to claim it there were a lot of fingers being pointed. They assured me that they would locate the ring or replace it.  It has been 4 months since this incident and they have done nothing to correct the situation.  While their food may be okay the complete lack of response on this issue complied with the a clearly poorly vetted staff is enough to keep me away forever.  The Boka Restaurant Group has shown a complete lack of follow through and its disappointing as they are given such high praise."
"Went here for dinner this week with a coworker. I made reservations for 6 pm on a Monday, turns out that it was unnecessary. By the time we left around 7 it was pretty full but even then there were a few tables open.We split the onion rings/fried pickles appetizer. It was pretty good, especially the pickles. Some of the onions were rather thick cut for my liking.My coworker ordered the beef ravioli and really liked it. I ordered the patty melt which was very good. However, another issue with too thick onions on the patty melt. I love caramelized onions like the ones on my patty melt but I hate biting into a huge chunk of onion like that. I picked the big ones off and kept on enjoying my sandwich!The service was very good and the restaurant was clean and visually pleasing. Prices are a bit high for a ""diner"". We each had a drink on top of the food and our bill was $66 before tip.Overall we were very happy with this restaurant!"
"i was at the bakery part of that unique nice place , i love the bread and the coffee, also the way you can sit outside, i will come back for a lunch ore dinner because what i seen on other plates walken pass me on other tabels made me very Hungry ;)"
"The family decided to eat here before a Blackhawks game on a Friday. We'd made a reservation for 4:45 on opentable but it wasn't necessary at that time. We pulled up to the restaurant and parked in a no parking zone (totally misread the signs...we're suburbanites you know) but luckily didn't get a ticket or get towed.  Valet parking is $12 (I think).  It is a really cool, decent sized diner.  It has lots of light and the windows open when it's warmer. We were seated immediately and our server was at our table within 2 minutes.  They have a good beer list with a lot of local breweries. Our server was knowledgeable about beer and liked our choices.  After he took our drunk order we really started looking at the menu. It is a diverse and eclectic menu.  I decided to go with the shrimp and grits, our daughter ordered the sourdough pancakes, son ordered the blueberry pancakes and my hubby got something with kimchi, pancakes and other ingredients but I don't remember what it was.  Everything was good however I've had better shrimp and grits and my son thought there were way too many blueberries in his pancakes (there weren't, they were very good). Overall it was a fun experience with great service, good craft beer and some tasty food. It is a little pricey for a diner so be prepared."
Fat Elvis Waffles.'nuff said.
"Eaten here many times and only have had wonderful experiences. If you attend on a busy day be prepared to wait in line. Good news is you won't need a reservation like you would attending the ""big"" goat nor will the meal break your bank given it's location. They move pretty fast. Hard to pick a favorite but I have to ditto the sandwiches, fish tacos and crab. I always end up taking a small pie to go."
30 minute wait for a Thursday lunch ( around 1:15 pm ) it wasn't too bad because they have a little waiting area with seats and the staff were really friendly Ordered the French toast with fried chicken ($16) and added a side order of hash browns ($5) and a glass of beer ($7) :) the beer selection was awesome & I really enjoyed the beer I got! But the French toast was just okay :/ doesn't come close to being one of the best that I've ever tried ! Hash Browns were good but were pretty oily and heavy. I'm not very impressed with this place! It was pretty hard to find parking spots but they do have parking lots around the restaurant!
Their menu doesn't have prices on it. Who does that?
"Talked to the Manager, Ryan who was very professional. He refunded all our $ and gave us me a gift card with the hopes I would come back. I thought that was extremely nice of him. I told him I appreciate the thought and that I would possibly return."
"writing this review for chef izard's first tiny goat bistro. we loved it! we read about it on her personal blog (we follow her as we are true stephanie izard fans). tasty, large ""tapas"". we had lots of leftovers.  intimate atmosphere (upstairs in their private dining room) and you can see them cooking and preparing all of the food right there. we had to wait a little bit after our reservation, but it was worth the wait! will come back if we're quick enough to get a reservation again!"
Love it. The food and the atmosphere are awesome.
"Probably the best black coffee I've had in Chicago. I don't add milk or sugar to my coffee so I can't talk about the goat milk. I wish I lived closer because I would come here every day just for that coffee. The chili cheese fries are the perfect comfort food when it's cold outside. Not super greasy either. I've had the goat burger which was a little too greasy. I couldn't even finish it and had to take it home. So the next time I got the veggie burger per our server's recommendation. It was actually one of the best veggie burgers I've had. I've only had one dessert. It was some sundae with sour cream ice cream. And it was as bad as it sounds. I'll def try some of their pies next time, and of course, the coffee from Little Goat Bread"
"I think my husband and I got lucky on our stop here. I hear that there is usually a wait of at least two hours, but for us on the Saturday of St Pat's weekend was perfect timing. I don't think we waited more than a half hour. The space is modern diner cafe and next door almost like a place you can buy other goods. We used it as a waiting area and we ordered a coffee and looked at the other Little Goat wares on sale like sauces and rubs while waiting for the text that our table was ready.We sat at a community table which wasn't too bad since that wasn't a new experience to me. My husband ordered the Bull's Eye french toast and I had the spiced apple pancakes. He was loving the french toast. It has these chicken crisps on top of 'Texas toast sized' slices of french toast. He marveled at the hidden egg inside the toast when he cut through his syrup drizzled breakfast. He said it was the perfect mix of a runny egg mixing with the sweet. I also fell in love with my gigantic portion of pancakes (which I had to box because it was a giant plate). Apple slices are buried in the fluffy stacks topped with the best spiced oatmeal crumble mix I have ever tasted. We were both stuffed and I would have to say I wouldn't mind coming back to try something new. Will just have to time it during some sort of downtown even when everyone is distracted and not thinking of brunch quite yet...."
"Amazing place with a great and wonderful staff. We have a hard time finding places that are willing & able to cook super plain food for my dad - and they were more than accommodating. Our food was great and majorly filling. I tried the bahn mi, fat club, tuna melt, grilled cheese (we shared- I didn't eat them all!) everything was great! The Elvis Cake is a dense and delicious slice of banana-peanut butter heaven with a side of crunchy bacon goodness. The decor was also really nice. It all had a retro look, but still felt very high end and very modern. I also love the vacant-in use door locks on the bathroom doors (not stalls). I feel it's a feature that is highly underused.  Can't wait to return!"
"Ok, this place is trendy. Ok, the ingredients and fusion concept are trendy.  Ok, the recycled Howard Johnson atomic chandelier is trendy.  Still, it is all executed well and you will get some very tasty food.  I had the katsu pork sandwich, and I would say it was on par with among the best Hoosier pork tenderloins I have had (and I'm quite an aficionado).  The addition of cabbage and vinegar and hoisin sauce really brightened it up too.  The onion rings and fries were well executed, too.   The ""fat elvis"" cake was spectacular.  Not too sweet, but the banana, peanut butter, and smokiness of the bacon were all balanced out.I'd love to come back here from breakfast sometime."
"Holy lord.  What a perfect breakfast/brunch/lunch spot.  Probably dinner too, but I was there for the best meal of the day (breakfast).Awesome design and really cool feel.  We had great service, the menu is ridonk, and the prices are quite reasonable for the quality of food.  My wife had this special which was a bunch of fresh arugula and other goodies with eggs on top of naan bread, while I had the crispy chicken french toast concoction, both of which blew our collective minds.  Plus we were basically full until we had a very, very late lunch (It was almost dunch.  Or is it linner?).  Was really impressed.  I'd love to go to the Girl and the Goat next time I'm in Chicago, but it's little diner sister in the form of Little Goat did not disappoint.  If I lived within walking distance I'd legitimately try to eat breakfast here as often as possible.  Top notch stuff."
"Little Goat delivers big taste!  This was my first visit to Little Goat today for a late lunch. The place is very busy so expect a long wait. The restaurant is an upscale diner, very noisy; the menu offers a variety of innovative dishes from breakfast to sammies to supper.  We waited for our table in the bar and had two very good drinks, a spicy good Bloody Mary and a Moscow Goat. The staff we encountered both at the bar and the restaurant were friendly and by their smiles, looked like they enjoyed being there. Our waitress, Joan, was warm, friendly, attentive and offered good suggestions. My husband had the ooey gooey cinnabun served warm with a yummy cream cheese icing which I, of course, had to taste. So good and, yes, gooey.  My husband had the shrimp and grits for his entree. The shrimp were plentiful and the grits cheesy. I had the grilled cheese which was layered with flavors of smoked tomatoes, two kinds of cheeses and pork guanciale (pork cheek).  So delicious.  I had the side of tempura mashed potatoes...omg!  Perfection and unique.  Actually, a lot of the offerings on the menu are unique takes on some diner classics.  The only negative to my experience is the banana cupcake with peanut butter frosting that I took home from the bakery. It was a dense banana bread cupcake with a peanut butter buttercream. It was just so-so. As a hobbyist cupcake baker, I make a more moist cupcake. I was disappointed. The restaurant definitely did not disappoint, though. I definitely think Little Goat is worth the wait.  I look forward to my next visit."
"After visiting Girl and the Goat I figured I would try Little Goat.  I had heard great things, but maybe the hype set my expectations too high.  The food was incredibly greasy - and I understand that it's a diner, but still.  The portions are VERY GENEROUS (which was a good thing).  I honestly felt a little sick after we left because I was so full of food and grease.  The food is an interesting blend of savory and sweet flavors so there's something for everyone.  Very lowkey, fun atmosphere.  I felt like it was a little pricey for what it was, but I wouldn't necessarily count it out as option for the future."
Great place for brunch/lunch in the heart of west loop.
The food was good but it's overly hyped. I had the scallops awhile ago and it wasn't bad. Pretty good actually. And the burgers they have are pretty good and large too.
Because I like to reserve 5 stars for the most elite of places I gave The Little Goat Diner 4 stars but I would recommend this place. I had a cup of chili which was fantastic. The sloppy goat was very good also with a nice blend of flavors. The Mac-and-cheese was good too but you have to be pretty poor to mess Mac-and-cheese up. Will return when in the west loop.
The hamburger that I got was pretty raw on the inside so could barely finish it. I do like a somewhat pink burger it this looked like it was barely cooked. They didn't ask how you want your burger cooked so I should have known.
Overpriced. Greasy. Too much hype around food that is equivalent in quality to a greasy spoon.  Not bad if I had paid half of what I did.
"Excellent, interesting, inspired Asian American 'you name it' fusion diner fare. Everything about it I love (minus the brunch lines, but go later and you're fine). I'd give it 5 stars, but their drinks are overpriced for their tiny size (hold the half a glass of ice, please)."
"Food here is great and the ambience was amazing. Shoutout to our server GILLIAN. She is definitely a keeper! Extremely friendly, and passionate about her job and is super patient with our indecisiveness. (It was our first time here and we were not sure what to order) She gave great recommendations on the menu like the fried chicken and the fried seabass (special of the day YUM). Knowing that we are from Atlanta, she also recommended places to visit! How sweet of her! Will definitely come back here for the wonderful service we had. Way to go Gillian!!"
"This diner is worth the trek outside the Loop if you're staying in downtown Chicago, especially if you have a gluten allergy. We couldn't get reservations at the sister restaurant Girl and the Goat so we thought we were ""settling"" on brunch at the diner instead. The menu is awesome packed with unique brunch items that all look and taste as good as they sound. Perhaps the best surprise was the daily selection of muffins and scones, which on the day we visited included squash, fig newton and gluten free apricot. The gooey cinnabun is also a must-get. While the breakfast pastries stole the show, the eggs and meat didn't disappoint either. Everything tasted very farm fresh - a far cry from standard diner fare. The service was excellent and the space itself was very interesting and modern."
"Amazing! The staff was friendly, the restaurant  was fun and funky. The food was out of this world try the fish taco tostadas and what makes place even better is the ice. Seriously, they got that awesome ice :)"
"Horrible house wine. The ""spaghetti"" breakfast contains literally four  spaghetti strings and a few runny eggs. The egg whites were raw. Some cheese, four clams and some shredded crab. The only flavor was eggs and cheese.  The seafood was completely overwhelmed by the cheese and egg flavor. If I didn't see the clam n crab I would have thought I'm eating a cheese omelet. $15.Was going to order more but that was so funny it ruined our enthusiasm.  Rushed service.  Very busy. Most people order fatty burgers and sandwiches.  Much fried food."
"What a disappointment. This was just diner food that was supposed to be comfy and retro but was all pretty bland. For the prices you pay here, I expected both better food and better presentation. We made a reservation and some people were waiting 30-40 minutes for a table on a Wednesday afternoon - not sure for what. Not sure the appeal for this place expect the name recognition. Wouldn't go back."
"I live about a two minute walk from Little Goat which is extremely dangerous but it's so yummy I can't help it but coming here for basically any meal. I love the fact that I can get a quick sandwich, salad and coffee on the bakery side, especially if the restaurant is really busy which it is most of the time. It's nice they do the ""text you when you're table is ready"" thing so you don't have to wait around in their crowded lobby. In my experience, the wait time is usually far less than they quote so be careful straying too far for a drink because the '45 minute wait' usually ends up being 25 minutes.My favorite thing on the menu by far are the fish tostadas-they're perfectly crunchy."
"Disclaimer: Do not come here if you are on a diet!  That said, this place is phenomenal.  Little Goat fully embodies the comfortable and friendly diner feel that they are going for...and beautifully combines it with modern and ingenious creations, bold flavors, and a very chic vibe.  The food is reasonably priced for the quality and unique dishes that are offered.  Chef Steph has added a very strong Korean/Asian influence to many of the offerings and even the weirder sounding fusion items are blended amazingly.4 of us went for brunch on Labor Day and my brilliant friends had walked over to put our name down an hour before we were meeting.  Our table was ready 5 minutes after we walked in.  Due to the Labor Day rush, they were running a 1-2 hour delay on grits so Shrimp & Grits was off the menu.  But we did get a side of grits at the end of the meal and it was phenomenal.  I went with the veggie burger Korean style - with kimchi and a sunny side egg on top with spicy mayo.  Delicious.  A great veggie burger (potato based and not grainy at all) and even better kimchi added to a super soft bun.  Once I popped the egg yolk, there was no way I was eating this thing with my hands.  My husband ordered the french toast that consisted of a fried egg INSIDE the bread that blew his mind.  The combination of fried chicken with strawberries and syrup blended to perfection.  We got a side of tempura mashed potatoes that were very unique and tasty, but quite honestly the fries were better.  Our other friend ordered the corned beef hash that was excellent as well.Definitely recommend asking for hot sauce - they have a hot and very hot option - both are housemade and I hope they start selling them by the bottle soon.Can't wait to go back and try...well, just about everything on the menu."
"The night at little goat was just okay. After the night was over no one in our party could figure out what all the fuss is about. This was my second time there...my memory of breakfast was better. The service was lacking...we felt rushed by our server, water was not refilled automatically, a  $12 drink was barely cold. The restaurant carries our the theme of a dinner. Keep in mind the space is very loud! If you like that then you are in the right place. The food was fine, the pork pancake was tasty but nothing memorable or special. I would not go back and would not recommend for the value for your money and overall experience."
"Went there on Wed evening being concerned that the wait would be too long. Surprisingly, we were seated on a communal table.  We didn't mind sharing the table and were glad that we didn't have to wait.  We took our 10 year old son.  It was our second time and we loved the fact that Little Goat serves breakfast all day long.  We all enjoyed the food and service.  We will be back again."
"Little Goat Diner is absolutely amazing. For starters, unlike The Girl and the Goat, its sister restaurant across the street, Little Goat does not require reservations. It's also open 24/7 making it the perfect place for a late night snack or a midday meal and guaranteeing that there will be points when there's no line. We walked right in on a Monday night. If you do have to wait, wait at the coffee bar next door, also part of Little Goat. The coffee (and tea) drinks are spectacular and a good way to get started. But back to Little Goat-- while the restaurant is a little bit loud, the food and drinks are amazing. I mean really good. It's so nice to see Chef Stephanie Izard take on comfort foods and put her twist on them. Her tuna melt is extraordinary. The fries were and are addictive. The cinnamon rolls are ooey goodness. Even the choices that weren't made in the restaurant are great. The restaurant as a solid craft beer selection, but I personally am in love with the vanilla cream soda. It's one of the best cream sodas I've ever had. And if, for some reason, you can't make it over to the West Loop, stop by the Little Goat stall at French Market -- at least you'll be able to have one of the great sandwiches (which are not on the menu at Little Goat Diner) and get to taste some of Stephanie's genius."
"What took me so long to get here? Ah yes, the wait scared me. They've been open for over a year now and it will still at least a 30 minute wait on a cold random Friday afternoon.  I put my name in (with a big sigh) and headed over to the bar area. And that's when I saw 2 seats at the bar (full menu available) with my name on them. Score!I took one look at the menu and said ta ta to my eat healthy New Years resolution (at least on this particular day). After deciding I wanted to go the lunch route (over breakfast) I narrowed it down to the tuna melt and fish tostadas. I decided to let our waitress choose between the 2 and she opted for the fish tostadas. And even another waitress who overheard enthusiastically shared that the fish tostadas were her favorite thing on the menu.  We couldn't help, but get not 1...but 2 orders of them! One for a very hungry me and one for my colleague.The fish tostadas were perfection. While still happy we got those bar seats very quickly, I can see why people are open to waiting for food this good. Stephanie Izard has made her very large fan club (myself included) very happy once again."
"I am a failure.  I'm not sure how I've neglected to write a review on this amazing piece of culinary genius for so long.  Suffice it to say I love this place.  Simply put it's aaaahmazing.  So I've been here about 4 times and no matter what I get, it's just insanely good.  So let's start with a favorite.  The bulls eye french toast.  Just do it.  If you do nothing else just do it.  This delicious piece of foodgasm is reason enough to keep coming back time and time again.   The pork belly pancakes and fish tostadas are also staples that must be tried.   The wait can get a little long if you don't have a reservation, but if you go on an off night or at a non-peak time (before 6pm, after 8:30pm) you can usually get in with around a 30 minute wait.  This of course is no problem, because the bar on the other side whips up amazing and strong cocktails that make you almost forget how hungry you are smelling all that amazing food.  Hmmm, I think I'm gonna go again tonight."
Had biz lunch reservations... Used their very convenient valet service... Breakfast creole or Cajun special was awesome as were the coffee and the service... Think I'm just getting too old for extremely noisy restaurants!
A retro diner with a modern menu. Breakfast served all day.Veggie-friendly selections are plentiful.Delicious.Great service.
"I am new to Chicago and heard that the little goat was a cheaper version of girl and the goat. We decided to try it for lunch and there was no wait at all.I got the bulls eye French toast and the portion was huge. It is definitely enough to share if you wanted to get a cheap meal. My wife had one of the Asian styled breakfast which was a bit salty but good as well.One of the disappointment was the little goat latte that we both tried. The latte had a hint of curry taste to my unsophisticated pallet, which made it... Not very good.Overall, it was an above average meal!"
"One of our favorite spots to go on the weekends. Usually hit up the bakery/bar side and get iced coffee and a muffin, along with a toasted bagel with either the sweet onion spread or honey Marsala spread. If sitting down and not bringing home you can't go wrong with a number of their dishes / my favorites include bisquits and gravy for brunch or their sloppy goat sandwich for lunch. Delicious and great atmosphere, generally hopping."
"Such a better experience than girl and the goat, the food was way cheaper, and honestly way better as well. I got the breakfast spaghetti with a side of crumpets, both were great, i would easily get them again, but there are so many other things on the menu that look good that i wanna try first, service was fast, got seated quickly, hope to be back soon"
Oh little goat.. My first there I loved the place.. The roof top area was cool.. But over time of dining in over and over I okay da played out. My go to has always been the grilled cheese Gouda sandwich and  the side of tomato soup. SOOO good. I've tried the blue plates specials from time to time also very good. I feel like the burgers are stay way from.. They are always salty.. idk why.. But from the look of other reviews of the burger id say I'm not wrong. The service is always friendly... Always mindful. I haven't had to ever ask for someone to come over because I needed more water or something.  I love the cheerwine. If you haven't ever tried one in your life you must. Establishment can seat groups it's just takes a lil longer with out reservations. And it's does get kinda loud so it's definitely not a meeting place.  I know the owner has another restaurant  called girl and you he goat.. it's usually hard to get into.. But I can't wait to get in to try it!
Not very impressed. I have had so much better in Chicago with very little to no expectations and although the price was right was underwhelmed and regretted coming here rather then any of the other amazing breakfast joints in the area. We had This Little Piggy Went to China and Corned Beef Hash. Flavor of the Little Piggy was unoriginal and tasted very cheap. The hash wasn't seasoned enough and the hot sauce we received after asking was thick and overpowering. Try Birchwood Kitchen in Wicker Park or Big Jones in Andersonville
"Very cute diner.  Their little goat logo has a special place in my heart.  You'll see in my upcoming review of Girl & the Goat.Ordered a few dishes too many, but the one that stood out the most was their Reuben.  Smoked corned beef with sauerkraut, kimchi, and havarti.  So many bursts of flavor.  And their pretzel rye toast was so soft.Their spaghetti dish was whack though.Oh, and take advantage of their photo booth."
"I don't get it.I'm going to have to agree to disagree with my fellow yelpers on this place.  I like the concept - it's a cute little diner with 'upscale' diner food.  However, it is simply overpriced for the quality.I have been here 3 times, and each time I feel like it gets worse.  For the most part, the food is very sub-par.  The food seems very unbalanced and each dish is either too rich, lacks in seasoning, or is just not good.  I'm really disappointed that this place is associated with Girl & the Goat - which is out of this world- I feel like this is the red headed step child. If you can't afford Girl & the Goat, or you just don't want to wait to get in, DO NOT think this is anything like it... it's just not.On top of not loving anything about the food... the service has always been very mediocre.  The servers always seem like they have something else on their mind and are partially listening to you.  My final complaint has to be the cocktails.  Total disappointment.  They have a menu of cute and classy cocktails- and then they get to your table and lack in taste and presentation (as they come out in plastic tumbler glasses- big no no).I hope that it's just me that's had 3 bad experiences, because otherwise I can't imagine this place sticking around for the long haul."
"This is really a 4.5 star review. I really liked Little Goat, we went for dinner but ordered lunch type stuff mostly. The bread of the day was Bacon Gouda and was super good. We got a grilled cheese sandwich that was pretty good, but a little heavy on one particular flavor. Also got a Los Drowned, which is like a french dip sandwich but with a bunch of extra stuff on it. It was very very good, if a huge mess to eat. We got two desserts, Choco Taco and a Blueberry Pie milkshake. Both of those were fantastic too. The service was very good, and the place is done very cooly. Sort of a swanky hipster version of an old american diner. My only complaint about the environment might be that it was very loud on a Sunday night, we pretty much had to shout to hear each other across the table. We will definitely be back, because their breakfast/brunch menu looked really interesting too, and they have some cocktails and beers that seem worth trying too. Great place, at a very reasonable price, and you can actually sometimes get a table without selling off a child or favorite pet. We'll definitely be back here.... We've since been back for breakfast and that was really good too. Got the bulls eye french toast, which is delicious if you don't mind a pretty serious sweet/savory mix. Also got the Parathas Burrito which was very unique and really good too. All in all it seems you can't really go wrong here. And at 8:30 on a Saturday there were plenty of tables available."
"We stopped by here after being discouraged by a 2.5-hour wait from another restaurant on this increasingly popular street.  After hearing so much about it, and the plethora of reviews on Yelp, we were surprised to be seated immediately.  Having done no research except knowing about Stephanie Izard, we were delightfully surprised by the breakfast-all-day mixed with lots of Asian influences.  Faced with so many equally delicious sounding choices, we ultimately settled on the goat burger with kimchi and fried egg, biscuit with gravy, smoked fries, and a brandade with pork belly.Everything was delicious, but on the salty side. It was not so obvious at the time, but after we got home we continued to guzzle an alarming amount of water for hours on end. So by the time the evening ended, all we could remember about the meal was how much water we had to drink afterwards."
"I visited The Little Goat Diner this past weekend with some friends who live in Chicago.  Apparently, this is the sister restaurant of the Girl and the Goat.  We showed up for an afternoon lunch and were quickly seated at the communal table in the middle of the restaurant.  This place has a great atmosphere, plenty of light and really unique decorations all around.  I love the open kitchen concept and wish more places would accentuate this area since in every restaurant the food is the most important part!We ordered several dishes, all of which were amazing.  The goat cheese chili fries were a unique blend on this common bar staple.  My girlfriend ordered a burger and it was delicious.  Plenty of flavor and the perfect size for lunch.  My dish of choice was the Sloppy Goat, their modern version of the sloppy joe made with goat on a squash roll.  To describe this dish in one word, wow.  It was huge and just as messy as the school cafeteria version of times past, only twice as good and not served by someone wearing a hair net!  Next time you find yourself on Randolph street craving something crazy good, check out The Little Goat Diner and let your palate enjoy the goat."
I love this place.  Everything I have ordered goes beyond my expectations.  Definitely check it out.
"I was a little nervous going in, as the new American/""high end diner"" thing is often an overdone, pretentious mess. Despite some of the unusual combinations (kimchee with pancakes, goat/beef/pork burgers), this place was top notch.We shared a whole bunch of things, so rather than give you an exhaustive list, I will juts note that 73% of them included pork, and all of them made us make very adult noises. We all particularly liked the pork cheek, which was a special that day. The PB&J pie (dessert), another item that could have easily been one-note, was fantastic.Our server was both prompt and funny and gave us tons of great recommendations for both food and cocktails, the latter being much better than I would expect for a place like this.Little Goat has a clear vision for what it is and really nailed it. I would love to go back or check out Girl and the Goat nearby."
"We stopped at Little Goat Diner for a quick bite during a long road trip. We had an online reservation that we moved around a little and were promptly seated once we got there.  We got the Los Drowned sandwich and Kilgus Goat Patty Melt. Both were both pretty darn good - the Patty Melt edged out the Los Drowned to win that round. The passion fruit meringue pie was refreshing and delightful. Our waitress (Kita) was excellent. The rest of the staff was attentive and ensured we were comfortable. This place has more of a contemporary/trendy diner feel than the usual diner vibe. Good mix when it comes to patrons and everyone seemed to be there for good food and a good time. Easily catered to by this diner. If we lived in Chicago, we would definitely go back to work through the menu and take down the cocktail list. The next time we visit Chicago, we will definitely go back!"
"I went to Little Goat for dinner a few weeks ago at the urging of my friend. She had been there plenty of times while I had Little Goat on my list of places to still try in Chicago. We made a reservation before hand so when we arrived at 7pm on a Saturday our wait for a table was only a few minutes. The first thing I noticed about this place is how cool the decor is. The tables and booths all look like they belong in a diner however the fixtures and lighting make this place very classy. We managed to get a booth which was really comfortable however the bar area by the kitchen looked like a cool place to dine. The menu itself is quite vast with plenty of different options. I ordered the beef ravioli while my friend ordered the smoked corned beef hash with eggs. The food came out quickly and was very good! My friend loves the smoked corned beef hash and gets it quite often at Little Goat and it didn't disappoint this time around. As for my beef ravioli, I thought the sauce was delicious however I would have liked a little more beef and ravioli in the dish. I walked out of Little Goat feeling like I'd barely eaten anything and a few hours later I was starving again.  All in all, this place is pretty good! At first glance everything on the menu seems pretty simple and synonymous with a diner however when it came out it was way beyond any traditional diner fare. The staff was really friendly and prompt and our waitress was very accommodating of a food allergy one of us has (they have a huge gluten-free menu) and gave us plenty of time to read the menu. This place is great if you're looking for some comfort food with class. I'll definitely go back however next time I'll try something that'll fill me up."
"I came to Little Goat with a large group for a birthday party after we found out Green Street Smoked Meats was closed on Mondays. I was doubtful that we would be able to get a spot, knowing how crowded all the West Loop places get, but lo and behold we were seated immediately! At first glance this place seemed like a funky, overpriced diner. While I walked away thinking that as well, I'm pretty okay with it after having the food! We started off with a few rounds of drinks (again, overpriced, but it's a trendy restaurant in a trendy area) and then started ordering. I got the Los Drowned, some sort of braised beef sandwich with pickled onions and peppers, cheese, spicy mayo, and a ton of au jus. Wow. This sandwich was amazing. Everything went really well and the meet so SO juicy and tender. I had a side of the fries, which are seasoned perfectly and cooked just how I liked them. I sampled some other things, including the cheese grits (not that good) and the mac and cheese (SO good). There was a great variety of the food on the menu, and I felt myself going back and forth between a couple different things that sounded great. The service was wonderful! Our waitress was so sweet and helpful and even brought out a little surprise for the birthday boy. She kept the drinks coming and made some great recommendations. It's a little more expensive than your typical diner, but you get what you pay for and tihs place was pretty fantastic. I'll be back."
Very delicious brunch -two weekends in a row because we loved it so much!Highly recommend the corn beef hash.
One of my favorite restaurants in the city! The nachos are to die for as well as the Club sandwich!!!! Just go. You won't regret it!
"We had dinner here days ago and are still talking about this meal....in a good way.Think innovative combinations, layers of flavor, affordable prices with no pretension. They accommodated our group of seven at a large table. We started with several apps: hot crab dip (comes with ritz crackers), crispy shrimp cocktail (think shrimp lettuce wrap) and goat chili cheese fries. Oh my, those fries. They smoke their fries for three hours (say what!). French fries will never be the same again.Menu is an interesting mix of diner fair and Asian dishes. All are very strong.The special of the day was a whole fish which we all wished we had ordered. Stand outs were the pork belly pancake and sloppy goat.Meal ended just as strong with both pies of the day. If you haven't ever had goat's milk ice cream, you are missing out. The coffee is from Stumptown and they are really killing it.Service was genuine as well, not overly formal, but helpful and down to earth. When our water glasses stayed empty a beat too long they even came over to apologize and comped our dessert- not something we expected or asked for in anyway.If you are in Chicago for any reason check out Little Goat Diner. For such amazing fare they sure do know how to make you feel comfortable."
"We just visited Little Goat for the first time. I made a last minute reservation on a Monday evening and we were seated very promptly when we arrived even though the restaurant was very full.The menu is extensive (in true diner fashion) and we needed some time to work our way through it. Our server, Andrea, was attentive but willing to give us as much time as we needed to make a decision. She was very knowledgable about their beer selections (we didn't have cocktails or wine but I trust that this girl really knows her stuff). She also noticed me struggling to choose between four different menu items and provided her recommendation (which was spot on btw). My fiancé and I ultimately decided to share the fish tostadas, bahn mi goat burger, and a side of the ""not chinese broccoli"". She was incredibly careful with my fiancé's tree nut allergy, even coming back to check that he could have ingredients like peanuts and sesame. We really trusted her which is hard for us to do.  The food was all incredible. Andrea sent us out a side of some really great tempura battered mashed potato something or other just because she's amazing. We ended our meal by sharing a smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake (sounds horrifying, tasted incredible). We will definitely come back here again and hope to get the same server (seriously, she was the best server I've ever had)."
"I came here with a friend and we had a lovely brunch. Everything on the menu sounded good, I mean everything. It took me forever to decide. But my friend talked me into getting the dish she had the first time she was at Little Goat, because it's a great introduction.That dish was the Bull's Eye French Toast. Delicious onion brioche bread with a baked egg in the middle, topped with barbecue maple syrup, strawberries...and the best part: fried chicken! It was a lot of savory and sweet in one plate which is ultimately my ideal plate. Also, I'm not usually a big French toast person but this dish won me over.My friend ordered the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing and we split both. Actually we wanted the shrimp and cheesy grits, but they were out :(If I had to choose two cons of this place, they would be 1. that they ran out of the shrimp and grits, and 2. (and this is super super nit picky), the table we sat at was in the light from the sunroof and there was a glare on me the whole time and I was sooo hot from the sun, even though it was freezing out. I was at the ONE table this impacted so really it's not a big deal.But I would go back again! A more affordable version of Girl and the Goat, but definitely try both!"
"I'm full just thinking about the feast we had at Little Goat.It goes without saying that Stephanie holds a special place in my heart as one of my fave Top Chef contestants. Of course, I was excited to try one of her restos and am still recovering from one seriously hearty meal that warmed my soul -- head to toe. I think we ordered nearly every appetizer on the menu so our entrees were in excess. Pure gluttony all around. That's how I want to spend my days in Chicago or anywhere for that matter.- I think Little Goat should be dubbed my personal fave nachos, like ever. The refried beans were the best part or maybe it was that uber flavor packed tender pulled pork... wait, the homemade tortilla chips? Yeah, let's just go with all of it, topped with a hefty dollop of guac.- Mac and cheese a must. I think I asked for more than my helping -- seconds, thirds, the last bite. - Entree: half order of biscuits and gravy with a side of cheesy grits: whaaaat. Amazing. This is my fave thing to order, always for a little southern comfort. Little Goat delivered a slightly upgraded version of B&G with pork sausage & mushroom gravy atop a flaky, buttery biscuit.- Fried pickles should be on your radar. Awesome batter, that's not too heavy and the perfect salty complement to the tangy pickle.I had a beer too... something local, but it was overshadowed by my desire for all of the carbs.Loved the swanky diner vibe. I can't wait to go back."
"Besides Boka, Girl & the Goat is one of my favorite places.  So of course I had to try out Little Goat.  It did not disappoint, so  much so that I returned two other times and even checked out the bakery next door.  Outstanding dishes - corned beef hash (one of the best I've had), fish tacos, goat chili, scones, cookies, and goat milk mocha with marshmallows.  I wish LA had a place like this, or maybe not because I'll get fat!"
"After being hyped up by friends for an eternity I finally got a chance to try Little Goat last weekend, and while the food was great, the service was incredibly lackluster for a place in a family of restaurants that's supposed to be so legendary in the Chicago foodie scene.We went for lunch, and I got a caesar salad which was in a league of its own in regards to what you typically get ordering a caesar at restaurants which amounts to some vaguely tossed romaine with some chicken slapped on top. Everyone else ordered from all over the menu ranging from breakfast-y stuff to more dinner-style entrees and everything looked great.The problem with the service, however, was two fold- First off, and this is a major pet peeve, you shouldn't need to be desperately trying to lock eyes with someone to refill drinks after everyone at your table has sat there for ten minutes with empty glasses. We rarely saw our waitress, to the point of it being awkward. When the food came out, it absolutely drizzled out from the kitchen, again making it pretty weird as everyone we were with politely waited as everyone finally got their food.So, as mentioned, great food... But service that was really lacking on a very basic level which really shouldn't be the case for how expensive it is. I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe we were just there on an off night, but, still, really weird given the reputation of the Goat restaurants."
"A wedding reception at a diner?  Why yes.  When that so called ""diner"" is the Little Goat.Who knew that hidden away on the second level of this nontraditional diner is a private dining area, complete with a chefs kitchen and patio area.  And just when I thought I had been everywhere!To get here- you enter in the door to the right of the bar area.  At the top of the stairs is the chefs kitchen and on this night- the island was covered in decadent appetizers each one looking better than the last.A small bar was set up at the back of the room with the large table for 30 or so set up down the center.  It was, in a word, stunning!And the food was equally as good!  We started with a range of appetizers like the baked crab dip served with Ritz crackers, cheese plates , pate, hummus and shrimp and spring rolls.  All were delicious and beautifully plated.  For our main course- there was a choice of scallops or pork shank again- just delicious!  The entire table was talking about how good the food was and how delightful the staff was who were serving us.  Dining in this special place for a special occasion was a rare treat!  The space is also good for cocktail parties that can move out to the rooftop or any other type of function you my want to have.  If you check their website- you can see the range of private events that they have hosted as well as get help in crafting your own special event.A wedding reception at a diner?  You bet."
"Rude waitress, greasy poorly cooked food, took way too long for simple dinner food. Save yourself the hassle and avoid this place."
"Yes. Yes. Yes. Yes. This place is AMAZING. We went on a monday night, the wait was only 15 minutes. (Stephanie Izards other restaurant The Girl and The Goat's earliest reservation is September!) We started off with their nacho appetizer. $14, enough for three people, and DELICIOUS. Looking at the dish you'd think it would be heavy and make you feel like shit but it's actually the opposite. Every bite was packed with a ridiculous amount of flavor. The cheese sauce, the guac, the pickled onions, the shredded pork, the homemade chips that were baked to perfection. THESE ARE WHAT NACHOS SHOULD TASTE LIKE. NO SHAME. This was the first time in a restaurant that I was sad that the waiter took the almost empty plate away. ""Hey! There's still a single bean on that plate"" It was so good my friend ate a pickled onion off the table. The five second rule didn't exist last night.My Friend ordered the ruban sandwhich. She's 99 percent vegetarian, and she happened to order the meatyest sandwhich on the menu. Now she loves killing animals! Thanks Izard! Haha. Joke. ONCE AGAIN NO SHAME. The combination of meats and kimchi was outstanding. She also ordered the mac and cheese, it was baked in a three cheese sauce. I had a bite. It was a great decision. I ordered the greek chicken salad. The salad came on top of a freshly baked piece of soft pita bread, covered in hummus and tazeki sauce. The chicken was juicy and tender and packed a lot of flavor. My friends father ordered the creamed corn (HOLY SHIT I USUALLY HATE CORN BUT THIS WAS MADE BY ANGELS) and some sort of Thai inspired beef and shrimp.What I was most impressed with, was the amount of flavor each of these dishes held. The combinations of ingredients was interesting, and just worked. You could taste every spice, and you could enjoy each bite. None of the dishes felt heavy, greasy, or loveless.Did we get dessert? Duh. We had to. The spiced chocolate cake with goat cheese frosting. The cake had a kick, and I'm usually not a fan of frosting but there was something about that goat cheese man.Save some money and go here. It's a great place to take a date. Don't have a date?  Take yourself on a date! NO SHAME.Get your goat on."
"No doubts I will be coming back, the food was phenomenal and the services provided by Julie (?) even better. Our server displayed wit, sense of humor, and genuine candor as she guided us through the menu and gave us space to enjoy our experience.  I arrived early and was invited to wait for my daughter-in-law either at the table or the bar area, I choose to have a drink at the bar.  Bartenders made a good dry Tito martini and they could use a little bartender manners - friendliness, chatter, etc. - especially when the drinks are overpriced. Once my daughter arrived we were seated, our server promptly guided us through the menu and answer our questions.  We order the soup of the day, butternut squash and we shared the Korean Burger (Kilgus Goat patty) with fries.  The soup was outstanding, creamy, thick, and the right amount of spics, topped with crunchy onions.  The Burger, with a fry egg on top, was a foodie's delight.  We closed the affair with Choco Taco, a decadent treat of sour cream gelato, over dark chocolate magic shell, cajeta (milk caramel), and chocolate dipped masa chips.  I think I tasted a little of heaven.We left satisfied and proceeded to end the evening with a nightcap at Del Toro.  My favorite drink Berry Jalapeño Flambé Margarita... but that is a different review."
"If I could give this place 4.5 stars, I would. I love this place, especially the Stumptown coffee. Visited a couple of times. The first time I ate breakfast and shared a sandwich, and the second I sat at the bar and had a white chocolate rosemary scone and a bloody mary. They make the best bloody marys I have ever had. The sandwich was delicious, and the bread perfectly toasted. After eating here, I went home and fell into a food coma."
We loved this place! We were here for a private event upstairs and the hor d'oeuvres were delicious!! We couldn't get enough and they were definitely offsetting the alcohol. They did a great job! The staff was really friendly. I can't wait to go back for dinner!
"Sometimes I hate that I live so close to this place, as it will likely result in me eventually gaining 10 lbs from the french toast alone.Seriously, the Bulls Eye French Toast is so good that half the time I go to Little Goat I don't even look at the menu because I know I'm going to order it anyways. When I have been able to look past the french toast, other favorites of mine are the pork belly pancake and the patty melt. I've also had some yummy salads in the summertime but it looks like they change that a little more seasonally.This place can be really crowded, luckily they started taking reservations (at least for lunch, I haven't made one for dinner), so it's a little easier to get in. I also love the rooftop in the summer. It is a lot smaller than the restaurant itself so it's hard to find a seat up there, but it is definitely worth it on those beautiful summer evenings."
"This place is so so so good. You can make reservations in advance or walk-in, but plan the night accordingly cause there's always a wait. If you want to eat at 7 as a walk in, I'd recommend arriving to Little Goat at 5:30 with plans to grab drinks before at one of the many bars in the area. The hosts are happy to take your cell number and text you when your table is ready.This meal was the best meal I've had in months with friendly service and awesome ambiance to boot. Our table sampled a variety of dishes:- Caramelized brussel sprouts with a balsamic vinegar glaze. I'm a big fan of brussel sprouts but it's kinda like...how good can they be? If you're in that camp, sample the ones at Little Goat and prepare to have your mind. blown.- Pork belly pancake with slaw. If I could bring this dish home to meet the parents I would. My dad is a bit traditional so I'm not sure what he'd think, but after a bite I know he would understand. Everyone at the table sampled this dish and there was not a single bite taken without a corresponding eye-roll and sigh at the deliciousness.- Biscuits. Which are technically on the breakfast menu. But since you can order breakfast all day and our waiter talked about how delicious the biscuits were, we had them as an appetizer. That's normal right? GUYS. Words are falling short but its the kinda food that makes you happy.Highly recommend."
"Ever since my first review, I can tell Boka and Stephanie are getting things right in her properties.  The service was immaculate and very engaging. The food was spot on!I had the Bull's Eye French Toast which was amazing.  The strawberries and fried chicken were great textures and flavors to the brioche french toast, that BTW had a freakin' over medium egg inside!  The syrup was great as it was smokey, had some left over chicken stock/flavor, and offered sweetness and heat.  Almost a reminiscent prelude to Stephanie's new one ""Duck Duck Goat"".  Only time will tell, but I'm very happy that Little Goat has their groove in my eyes!"
"Went here on a double date the other night and will admit- my mind was not blown. I REALLY wanted it to be blown!  I took my sister and her wife here with high expectations.  First, the food was good. We did enjoy our meal. Not life changing but it was pretty good. It didn't feel very inventive though- maybe the original restaurant is better.Next, the service was a real disappointment... No water refills, no soda refills, mixed up orders and the waiter kept touching us which was a weird approach. We came out spending $100 plus for four people which is okay...but didn't love the meal or the experience."
Not quite as good as Girl and the Goat but still pretty decent for next level diner food. My wife was really looking forward to the sloppy goat but we were a little disappointed. The best dish was the brussels sprouts which were absolutely phenomenal and have been duplicated in our home several times now.
"Boyfriend and I went for late lunch on a Monday around 1:30pm, no wait. Our waiter was really nice and gave us some good recommendations. I had the sloppy goat and bf had the los drowned. We were both blown away by how amazing these sandwiches were!  Simply put, best sandwiches we've ever had- especially the sloppy goat.  I would definitely go back and try several other menu items!Great service. Great food. 5 stars"
"Great decor.  Love that they have a separate vegan menu but it's a disappointing line up. The big points scored for this restaurant is due to the friendly staff.The vegan menu has little variety and pretty much all consist of a variation on salad.The wait to get is is typically long so an Open Table reservation is strongly recommended.  If you plan on talking to anyone while dining, go some place else.  The noise level is off the chart.  Loud music which forces everyone to talk louder makes this unfavorable for my taste.  The staff is aware but no attempt to turn down the music was made."
"The cocktails are great, they have a good and current craft beer selection, coffee is always great, and the food is awesome. I like the Spanish omelette, which is sort of an omelette with chilaquiles mix.Service is so-so. I think it's because on weekends it's so busy. But still, there is a lot of room for improvement in that area.I recommend the Little Goat for breakfast (served all day, by the way)."
"This is a place that gets quite a lot of attention.....We stopped in for lunch and after waiting for a bit, we were seated at a communal table in the middle of the restaurant. Not my first choice, especially in a loud restaurant, but that's what we got. Our server (Patrick) was friendly and even though he seemed to be training someone, he did a nice job. The table ordered a variety of things - french toast, biscuits and gravy, corned beef and hash with eggs and the reuben. The french toast got rave reviews! I had the reuben and even though it was good, I probably wouldn't order it again because it wasn't really amazing. Overall, the place was just okay for me. It's possible that the crowded, loud seating affected my opinion of the food; however, if your meal is amazing you tend to forget all the little stuff."
"I would give Little Goat 4.5 stars if I could. Incredibly creative, delicious food and great service in a really fun space. It's diner-esque, but really well done. We ended up going twice in 24 hours--the first time while killing two hours between drinks at The Aviary and a late dinner at Girl and the Goat, and then again the next night for dinner. Both times the service was great. Camille especially was absolutely wonderful.There are lots of breakfast options that are served all day (""Cereal Killers""). We wanted the Bull's Eye French Toast, but they were out (sad face), so we had the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup instead. The crumpets are made to order, topped with crumbles of chorizo, maple syrup, and sliced gooseberries. Perfect combination of sweet and savory.The Shrimp and Cheesy Grits were incredible. In. Credible. Savory, shrimpy, with a little bit of heat, seafood stock, braised pistachios, Brussels sprouts leaves, stewed tomatoes, scallions. Unprentious, shockingly flavorful comfort food. The Reuben, with smoked corned beef, kimchi, saurkraut, cheese, and yellow mustard on pretzel rye was really something. The kimchi is a great addition to a traditional-ish reuben, and it's ridiculously delicious.We had the side of Glazed Root Vegetables (parsnips and carrots), which were fine but not exciting, especially compared to everything else we had.The seasonal cocktail, Fall in a Cup, was disappointing, but that was after drinks at The Aviary, so it was probably not a fair assessment. It was too sweet for me.The Cheez-It Sundae (Cheez-It elato, strawberry quick ice cream, chocolate/peanut butter covered Cheez-Its, peanut caramel sauce, whipped cream, and, of course, a cherry) received mixed reviews at our table. I really liked it, but I'm partial to salty desserts."
"This place is understandably packed for weekend brunch. The atmosphere is lively and fun. Sat at the bar and got the bull's eye french toast and brandade and belly to share. Maybe it's because there were so many people, but both items came out kind of cold.If you love fried chicken, you know there is nothing better than the crispiness of fried chicken right out of the fryer / oven. By extension, there is nothing more tragic than the sogginess of fried chicken that has been sitting for just a bit too long. And for someone who loves the savory / sweet contrast, I found that the dish did not have enough of either. The brandade and belly tasted like...its constituent parts. This was one of those dishes where the sum was not greater than individual components. And given the lukewarm temperature of the dish, the combination of brandade / kimchi actually tasted slightly reminiscent of garbage. Not my favorite. The nice thing is I probably drank my weight in coffee, which was quite good."
"Went here while I was visiting Chicago.  The best food I had on the whole trip by far!  I had a Reuben with a chai latte, both were excellent.  Also great service, definitely go here."
"They have a vegan menu, but the items are just ok and rather pricey for what they are (why does adding a few mushrooms to the veggie burger cost $2 more??). I've been here twice for brunch and have had the taco salad and the veggie burger twice. The taco salad was a large portion size with good texture and flavor. The veggie burger was overly horseradish-y and the patty was crumbling all over the place. My nose was consistently running while eating the burger (you know that horseradish feeling). I do appreciate that they make the patty in-house. The burger also comes with no sides. The chickpea fritter always sounds so delish but alas, they cook it in the same oil as meat items, so I don't order it. There are definitely better places to hit up in Chicago for vegan brunch that have more variety and better value (and way less horeseradish!!). This may be one of those places that you go to once for the experience and then don't go back."
"Not your typical diner, though they do have the diner staples and seem to do them well. I arrived nice and early, around 7:30am on a Sunday. The place wasn't full but there were already a few groups there, and within an hour or so it was pretty busy. Every other order I saw come out was for the corned beef hash, which looked really good -- corned beef hash is one of my usual favorite dishes, but after looking over the menu I had to try the ""breakfast spaghetti 'n clams 'n crab."" There was spaghetti and egg, in a white clam broth with bits of crab and guanciale and bok choy mixed in for a very tasty--if not very breakfast-y, though I didn't mind!--flavor combination. I was greedy and also ordered their cinnamon roll, which was delicious. The bread was fluffy and cinnamon-y and it was covered with a generous amount of cream cheese frosting. YUM!! Wish I was in the area so I could go back to try more of the things."
"This place is one of the many excellent restaurants on Randolph. The Goat Almighty Burger is ridiculous! A beef burger, topped with braised beef and pulled pork, topped and bottomed with jalapenos and onion ring layers, inside a bun, forming a Leaning Tower of Heart Attack. Kalbi short ribs were my favorite. Spread over a delicious fried rice with strawberries, which really complimented the kalbi flavor well.  Goat chili was good Interesting were the pizza poofs on top. If they have it, the blueberry pie with goat cheese gelato was soooo gooood!!"
"The little goat is as amazing as everyone says it is! We came here for brunch and had about a 30 min wait on a Sunday at 10:30am. Our waitress was extremely nice and smiley- great way to start a Sunday morning after a long Saturday night. We ordered the paratha burrito, crispy fish tostadoas, and the cheesy garlic bread. I so ordered the wildflower cocktail. The fish tostadas were definitely the winner, and the drink looked cute but sure was strong- another winner! Highly recommend this place for brunch!"
"As far as I can tell, Little Goat is overrated.I had been hearing and reading rave reviews, so I was excited to finally try it. I came here for brunch with a friend on a weekend, and the wait was about 45 minutes for two bar stools, which we expected.The two of us oped to share the Brandade and Belly and a tiramisu milkshake. The milkshake was fine, nothing special. It tasted more like plain chocolate and wasn't screaming with the flavors of tiramisu. The Brandade and Belly was also alright. It was certainly enough food for two, but the flavors were not memorable. Rather than being a marriage of the brandade, pork belly, egg, and kimchi, it was more of a mishmash of disparate flavors on the same plate. And the biscuit was a bit stale.Besides average food, our waitress was curt, bordering on rude, and rarely checked in on us. I understand that the place gets packed, but the service was not good.Little Goat is fine; there are better restaurants in the West Loop."
"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! I wanted to try The Girl & The Goat, but didn't want to spend that much. My friend told me that this place was a little more casual, and run by the same chef. It did not disappoint. We started off with the goat chili cheese fries and they were delicious, fresh, and flavorful. I got the most epic fish tostadas, my friend got the delicious fat club sandwich, and my other friend got los drowned. Everything was  absolutely amazing. Our food got to the table right away, our server was great, and our cups were never empty. Highly recommend!!"
"On our recent trip to Chicago, we attempted to come to Little Goat twice.  The first time was on a Sunday morning about 9:30am.  While we were told it would only be a 30 minute wait (not bad at all!), we were pretty hungry, so we headed to the bakery, which shares the space with Little Goat.  Over in the bakery, my wife and I both had a bagel.  Let's be honest here, though, this wasn't just any bagel you get from your corner store.  I had the apricot with a smoked salmon schmear, which was delightful!  My wife had a rye bagel with the sweet onion schmear, which she also enjoyed.  Bagels and schmears are all made in-house, so you should probably just try them all.  We also each had coffee.  Now, I know what you might be thinking, ""Oh, diner coffee?  Nothing special.""  Well, dear reader, you're wrong.  Seriously.  One of the best parts about Little Goat is that their coffee is from Stumptown, so even the drip coffee was delicious!  This is not your average diner, trust me.Now, seeing that we did not get a proper breakfast on Sunday morning, we decided to hit up Little Goat again on Monday.  As it wasn't too busy, we were able to get seated right away on Monday.  Since we were also traveling on Monday, we had our suitcases with us.  the hostess kindly offered to let us keep them at the hostess stand while we dined, which I thought was a very nice touch.  Let's talk about the food for a minute, mmkay?  I had, what was described to me as a blue plate special, or, what I like to call, Heaven on a plate.  Yes, it was that good.  To begin with, there was a goat hot dog.  Of course it was goat, what else would I expect at a place called Little Goat Diner?  That goat hot dog was then wrapped in a very large, fluffy, pancake.  As if it couldn't get any better, that was then topped with two eggs, cooked to perfection.  Just when I thought it couldn't get any better, the entire plate was then covered with a maple barbecue syrup.  YES. PLEASE.  It was divine.  My mouth still waters when I think about it.Now, it's important to note that everything on the menu is a la carte.  This isn't a bad thing.  There's no NEED for sides.  C'mon, though, it's breakfast.  Live a little.  We decided on the cheesy grits for our side.  ""Can I get the carbs, with a side of carbs?  Thanks!""  These also did not disappoint.  They were rich and creamy, just like grits should be.   Go against your better instincts and get a side.  Thank me later.I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Chicago!"
"First impression: are we in a Seinfeld episode? Little Goat knows how to take a reservation, they just don't know how to hold a reservation. I understand when diners take longer to eat then you expect, or the only open table is for a party of 10, but then - don't take reservations for 5 different parties for the same time! We arrived at 7:45 for an 8pm reservation, hoping to be seated early. Not the case, which is fine - but then 8pm came and went. People got seated around us. We went up to the hostess stand (""Hi, we have a 'reservation') and were told that everyone else around us has reservations too. In that case - hey, Little Goat, if you can't figure out how reservations work - just get rid of the whole system and do walk-ins only. Bam. Then you won't have people like me complaining about waiting 20 minutes past a reservation time.Anyways, the food. Was fine. To be honest a first impression is a big thing, and after finally sitting down, I wanted to be wow'ed, and I just wasn't. Expensive for diner food - even high end diner food. The chocolate chip pancakes were good, but not great, even with the chocolater butter/smear they served it with - just dry. The Bulls Eye french toast, though, was delicious, and if I would ever go back, that's what I'd order again."
"First rule, don't get up at 7 on a Sunday to go to breakfast. Cute place but breakfast should be simple not deconstructed corn beef hash. Biscuits and gravy were okay. I should have stayed in bed."
"The BF, his brother and I came here for brunch a while back. While we waited, I enjoyed an AMAZING Bloody Mary (I'm pretty sure it had kimchi in it...and it was delicious) in the bar/bakery area. We had requested a booth, and didn't mind waiting for the crowds to subside. Even when we were called, it took a few minutes to get our table, but it was well worth the wait. The hostesses were incredibly polite and apologetic with the delays.The food was A-Mazing. I ate so much. Because of the wait, they brought us out a crab dip appetizer to start, and it was delightful. The crackers got a little soggy sitting in the dip, but oh man was this delish. The BF's brother ordered the goat chili, which was super tasty. I had the Parathas Burrito which was SO flippin' good, I don't even know how to begin. I was a little concerned, because I've never done the sunny side up egg thing before, but it was cooked just the way I like my eggs, runny yolk, solid white. Win. The flavor combination was unique and perfect for my quirky breakfast palate. I would go back to Little Goat in a heartbeat. Man, now I'm jonesin' for a Paratha Burrito. And a Bloody Mary."
"This place!  If you're looking for a unique (and delicious) brunch spot, I would stop here.  Last time I went in, we got a table outside. I got the parathas burrito and my friend got the this little piggy went to China.  We started with two of the cinnamon rolls, which I highly recommend, but you might want to split!  They were huge.The one downside was my entree came out 15 + mins (not an exaggeration) before my friends.  The server was great the whole time and incredibly apologetic, and we had two managers stop by and apologize as well.  Both entrees when they did arrive were wonderful, Little goat has a knack for combining strange ingredients in unique (and delicious) new ways.  Since all the food when it came out was incredible, they gave us a round of drinks on them instead.  Great idea!  I had a delightfully smoky (and huge) bloody mary.I'd be back again - one service hiccup, especially one that they took care of so well, could not keep me away from the unique food and friendly staff."
"I've been 4 or 5 times now. This is by far my favourite place to eat in Chicago. The food options are different to anything that I've seen before but they are all executed perfectly. The Bull's Eye French Toast is a favourite followed closely by the Fat Elvis Waffles. The menu goes deep so there's always something that you want to go back for.It is a large, light and spacious room with great decor and a variety of comfortable seating for different group sizes. I've had a different server each time and always had a good laugh with each one. I don't have a bad word to say about this place. Looking foward to the roof deck opening; this place just keeps giving.Oh and the cinnebun, get the cinnebun!"
"Went to Little Goat Diner for a late dinner with a friend on a Friday night. No wait if we sat at the bar (we did), and our server was super friendly, funny, and gave us great service. Unfortunately, the Sloppy Goat I ordered was way too salty. The Tempura Mash was an interesting twist, and the spiciness of the Blenheim's Spicy Ginger-ale added a unique twist to the meal. Little Goat Diner seemed to have everything going for it, but it's hard to feel good when the main dish was drowned in sodium. I do plan to try it again, as this is a quite a popular joint with very reasonable prices. Maybe I just got unlucky that day."
"The fat Elvis waffles. The fat Elvis waffles. Did I mention the fat Elvis waffles? Sundays usually have a long wait but if you know you're getting those waffles it's totally worth it. Put your name in, grab yourself a beverage and sit outside. The flower boxes are beautiful! Then dream of those waffles sitting in front of you until you receive that glorious text that your table is ready."
"Had a great time here this past weekend. It was busy and there was a wait for our table of 2, so we headed over to the bar in the other room and had some breakfast cocktails while we waited, which helped time pass very quickly. I had the Bullseye French Toast (get it! you'll love it!) and my date had the Asian Style Breakfast TastyThing. He said mine was better.Service was good, prices were good, meal was delish. Can't complain!"
"Flying solo this trip, so I decided to try Girl & the Goat which was near where I was staying. I go to a conference in Chicago every year and love exploring a new neighborhood each time. It was a weeknight, but it was still busy and I didn't feel like braving the crowd at the bar. Lucky for me Little Goat is right across the street! I sat at the counter near the expediter, which was probably the most interesting part of the meal, so I didn't mind the slow service. I ordered a small goat chili, the pork belly pancake, and a glass of wine. Everything is a la carte and there are so many choices! The chili used different spices than traditional chili, nutmeg perhaps? Usually I am not a chili fan, but this was good. The pancake is listed under ""sammiches"", but definitely requires a knife and fork. It was ok, definitely more slaw and pancake than pork belly. Next time I'd try something from the 24/7 breakfast menu or a burger, many many tasty looking things coming out of the kitchen.  In my book this would be a splurge, but a good deal compared to its sibling."
"Fantastic little joint in the West Loop. Obviously, when you're the diner of one of the best restaurants in Chicago (Girl and the Goat) everyone knows it will be amazing but I figured I'd put in my two cents. I've dined here for lunch and dinner and have also came for a late night drink and every time was phenomenal. The menu for lunch and dinner was 100 percent on point.  You cannot go wrong with the Los Drowned and Sloppy Goat, but whatever you decide I recommend to split with someone you're with because you want to try as many things as possible. The side bar late night is awesome too. It's not too crowded on weekdays and the bartenders were real cool. Can't wait to go back!"
"Can I start with, ""I love girl and the goat but......""Had high expectations for this place after dining at Stephanie's other establishment across the street.  Well, the next day, when I thought about what we had, I actually got a little peeved.... the bill was almost $70 before tip!  And this is the diner version mind you...Here is what we had:Toffee and pork shake $7-sounds exotic, had to get it!  We are thinkin, what is that Stephanie gonna come up with next! What it really was....a milky, watered down toffee shake....NO PORK...  :(Breakfast spaghetti-this is gonna be wacky and delish right??  Nope.  Noodles with a egg scrambled in, some mussels and a heart attack worth of SALT broth.  Yuck.THose Shrimp!  The ones in all the pictures.  Good, but really just some fried shrimp with a wilted piece of lettuce... $15 for 5Sandwich I forgot the name of-was supposed to be beef with avocado and some other yummie wacky things but it was really just an Italian beef...but it was like $13 with no sides... Comparable to PortillosAnd the last item...my fountain soda that cost me over $3.... is there a syrup shortage I should know about?Cool space, great server...but not inclined to go back...esp with Au Cheval next door!"
"Long wait, expensive menu. However, fantastic food and huge portions. Vibrant atmosphere. Nothing on the menu is boring, either. Everything has a twist to it. Friendly wait staff, but usually too busy to be very attentive. Overall, great experience. But call ahead to streamline."
"Went for lunch with my mom.  Was smart and made a reservation the night before.  Saved us some wait time.  Hint you can do it on Yelp!  Mom had the goat version of sloppy joe with a spicy slaw. Yummy! I had a hard time deciding what to get the menu is just something else but u decided on the shrimp and grits.  Now I have a thing for grits, it's one of those gotta have it and compare it to others I've had.  Like always trying the pad Thai.  It's a thing.  Anyway.  These are good! I mean good.  So good we got an order of them to go for my dad (also an enjoyer if grits) because I felt guilty for having them without him.  FYI they traveled well.Definitely on the list for a return to try something else but will be hard to resist the grits!"
"For my last full day in Chicago the boyfriend took me to eat at Little Goat. We had previously heard of the place a couple nights before through a few of his friends that had gone as well. We walked in with no reservations on a Friday morning and were told there was no wait for being seated at the counter. I'd say the only drawback from sitting at the counter is that it's a bit hotter because the kitchen is right in front of you. Anyway after looking at the menu I decided I really wanted to eat a brunch item because well I was still kind of craving breakfast. I narrowed the items down to either the Brandade and Belly or the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancake (super long entree name). When the waitress came to take our order, she suggested the brandade especially if you don't mind a more ""seafood"" flavor. The boyfriend then ordered the Shrimp and Cheesy Grits with a side of hashbrowns light on the cheese. The restaurant has a great ambiance and seems to be quite busy all the time. The food took a bit of time to come out...but maybe because I was starving and was slightly impatient when it came to waiting. BUT, IT WAS SO WORTH THE WAIT. My meal was so delicious the biscuit was so moist and sweet which was a nice contrast to the bradade sauce. The concoction was unique but melded so well. I was so excited about my choice. I tasted a bit of the Shrimp and Cheesy Grits, it was good but I liked my dish so much more. To me it was similar to a pasta...not bad but NOT AS DELICIOUS AS MINE...at least in my opinion. The BF and I argued a bit about whose tasted better and I think mine did. LOL. i hope next time I go to Chicago I can try one of their shakes as well...YUM."
"Amazing. I could just sit there and eat sides. The brussel sprouts were some of the best I've had, and their mac and cheese was yummy too."
"TL:DR - Surprisingly disappointing. Not worth the wait or the raving reviews it has received.I will give kudos to Little Goat for a very creative menu and impressive medley of flavors for each dish. Brunch options are very original and were exciting to read about. Unfortunately, the execution turned out just average, like many other diners. Unlike many other diners this one has a very long wait and is one of the best reviewed in Chicago. What gives? Here is an example. I ordered the fried chicken French toast. It has a runny egg in the middle and delicious syrup on top. only problem is that instead of actually being fried chicken what is served his chicken fingers. Look at photos of the dish on yelp if you do not believe me. Kinda misses the whole point of the dish doesn't it?Chicago is a wonderful restaurant with plenty of great brunch places to try (see Lula or Owen & Engine); i'd rather go to a new place or back to an old one then try one this again."
"The chef combines foods and flavors you wouldn't necessarily think to put together. Our waiter was amicable and pleasant- whatever I asked, he knew it could be done.We started with fried pickles with 2 dipping sauces, ranch and curry. They were sweet pickles which combined nicely with the curry sauce. The smoky fries only had a hint, very slight hint of hickory? I wasn't impressed with them. The shrimp & grits were good and I loved the bits of brussel sprouts in it, but, too much sauce, not enough grits, and over cooked shrimp made it just an ok dish. The jack-o-lantern (pumpkin) Shake had just the right amount of pumpkin flavor with a hint of ginger- very tasty!"
"I find myself going back to Little Goat more often than I would like - always leaving not quite disappointed, but never fully satisfied. For me, Little Goat has become the ""overflow establishment"" - the last in line after being rejected by every other restaurant on Randolph: Au Cheval - ""2 hrs""; Girl on the Goat - ""1 hr""; ok fine, let's try to find at seat at the Little Girl bar. I know I should give it more love and gratitude (it's been a life saver on a number of Friday nights) but I find it hard to get excited about this place. The food has always been sufficient but always a let down after I've deluded myself with the off chance of maybe being able to get into au cheval...I've had several of the burgers and they're all fine, can't go wrong there. The Asian inspired dishes are a good attempt at creativity but the end result is neither here nor there. As a side note, the portions are fairly large so good place to come with a few friends."
"After a pre-employment medical screening downtown, I decided that it was time to try a new place. While not too familiar with the area where my physical was being held, I found out the facility was just a short walk from Ogilvie Transportation Center. That being said, I searched Yelp for some Breakfast/Lunch type fare, and Little Goat piqued my interest.I was aware of the Girl and the Goat, but I did not know that there was a diner-style type restaurant that featured exactly what I was looking for. They also have a location in the Chicago French Market where they sell their 'daily bread.' It's also available for purchase at the diner. The diner is located across the street from the World Famous Girl and the Goat.I entered the restaurant around 12:30 PM. I was expecting it to be busy, and it was. They have outdoor seating, but I had no desire to wait, and being a solo diner, I was seated promptly at the diner counter.Being the meticulous fellow that I am, I scouted the menu before arriving to the diner. Unfortunately, I'm also very indecisive. I knew I wanted to eat at the Little Goat, but now I just had to figure out what.Before I arrived, I knew I was going to go with Pancakes or a Burger. I teetered about 7 times before making my decision. To clear my head, I decided to place an order for the Goat Chili. It came served with cheddar cheese, sour cream, jalepenos, and pizza 'poofs,' which were pizza flavored croutons, in essence. The chili was quite small in size, but it was my favorite part of the meal. I had never tried goat, but I could definitely tell the difference from beef. As usual with exotic meats, it was a bit gamier. I really enjoyed it. The jalepenos were a bit sweet, which I enjoyed, because I'm not a huge spicy guy. I like some kick, and these fit the bill.After devouring my six dollar chili (which couldn't have been a full cup), I was still debating on what to order. Breakfast was not out of the question at this point. Looking back on this moment, I wish I would have ordered one of their 'cereal killers.'My default rule at all diners is to order eggs, meat, and toast.   My default rule at a pancake house is to order the omelette and pancakes. Since this was skewed towards a diner, I was going to order some farm fresh eggs, bacon, and toast for my meal, but I was intrigued by all the pancake options, especially the sourdough pancakes. I initially told my waitress that I wanted those, but then I became indecisive and withdrew the order. Looking back on it, I should have ordered those with a side of eggs and bacon.After two more minutes of debate, I ventured back to the burger menu. After sampling the goat chili, I decided on the Kilgus Goat burger, cooked medium. I had it done ""All American,"" which was simple lettuce, tomato, pickles, onion, special sauce, and American Cheese. I had them hold the latter two ingredients, because I hate mayo, and every special sauce has mayo, and American cheese is okay, but I didn't feel like it would have made my burger any better. Just trying to be a bit health conscious! The All American came with a sesame seed bun, but I decided on the potato bun because I asked my waitress and she really did a poor job explaining the options to me. Oh well, the potato bun ended up better than the sesame seed bun would have been.  Along with my burger, I decided to order some of their sauteed vegetables. On the online menu, it stated sugar snap peas, but it actually ended up being sauteed vegetables, which featured mostly asparagus, radish slices, a small amount of peas, and it was topped with crispy onions. The veggies were very good. Just tender enough but not wilted. Kudos on those!As for the burger, I wasn't 'wowed,' but it certainly was not bad. The goat once again had a different taste from beef, and it was good. I wish there was something fantastic I could say about the burger, but I've had much better in the city (Bad Apple, Butcher and the Burger). It's my fault because I shouldn't order a burger at a place like this, and also I had a standard order, not one of their specialty burgers. For 14 dollars, I expected a bit more.Overall, the service was a bit slow. I understand it was lunch, but I had just fainted at my physical, and I was super thirsty, but my waitress only checked on my once after my food came, so I was a bit parched. My total ended up being 26 dollars. While I understand dining out in the city for lunch at a non-franchise place will be pricey, I felt I was charged a bit high. They are doing something right, though, because the place was full the whole time I was there.I would not go back for the burgers. I teetered between a 4 and 5 for this place, but I couldn't give them a 5 because my experience was not at that level, due in part to the prices, service, and quality of the food ordered. If I were to go again, or were to make a suggestion to anyone, order a breakfast specialty!"
"Ohhh Little Goat. I just think this place tries too hard to be innovative with its food....The menu is diverse and kinda crazy and you get excited. But when it comes it just doesn't match up to your expectations. Unfortunately I have spent the last 3 months living in LA and thanks to that, my expectations are extremely high. Maybe that's why I just didn't like it.We got the Bulls Eye French Toast which came with fried chicken, BBQ maple syrup and strawberries. It sounded good, but just didn't work for me; the BBQ maple syrup was just weird and the strawberries didn't go with the syrup or chicken. We also got the Brandade and Belly. Too be honest, there was just too much going on on one plate here. Again, the idea was good but I just don't think the meal followed through. There was belly pork, biscuits, kimchi, brandade and fried eggs on the plate. I do have to say though, I enjoyed the kimchi because it wasn't too spicy even though you would expect kimchi to be a lot spicer. Sorry, Little Goat but it just doesn't work for me."
"Hey stupid goat thanks for letting me not place a phone order for TAKE OUT for dinner ...""you can come in and place an order and wait 30 minutes, maybe longer since dinner rush is coming through"" Dumbest thing I've ever heard. So annoyed. No thanks."
"Place was packed. Was told an hour and 30 mins wait. At least they face us an option to sit at the community table. We sat at the end of table close to breakfast bar. We were luckily enough to see Stephine Izard owner make our food. Had fillet O fish sandwich, goat chili, Mac and cheese, and Reuben sandwich. Food ok, recommend goat chili and Reuben sandwich. Mac and cheese not gooey enough for me. Fish sandwich bread was a bit too hard to eat.I don't like the cloth napkins that they give us. It left white lint on our clothes especially around my husband face, what's that stuff on your face?Overall an OK experience."
"On a whim, I ordered a chocolate goat milk here and drank it outside while people watching. Weird? I know.Was tasty, but the chocolate severely overpowered the taste of the milk. Get the chocolate milk if you want to taste chocolate milk, not if you're looking to taste the nuances of goat milk."
"I got the BRANDADE AND BELLY. it was delicious! the pork belly was made so that it was nice and charred and crsipy on the outside, but melts in your mouth on the inside. It also comes with Kimchi on the side, which i thought was brilliant as well. My friend got the bulls eye french toast and it was probably the best breakfast item i tasted. It was sweet and savoury at the same time and the syrup on top of it was heavenly.Definitely going back to this place when I visit Chicago again."
"Of course as a tourist, I was all like ""We are going to Chicago--- let's go to Stephanie Izard's Girl and the Goat"".  And of course we didn't make a reservation.  And of course they had a ridiculous wait (it may have been 2 hours... but don't quote me on that).  So we headed across the street to Little Goat.The first thing I noticed was how big the space was- it has nice high ceilings and it felt very comfortable in there.  The second thing I noticed was the whole place was PACKED!  In fact, when we asked for a table, I think it was at least an hour wait (on a weeknight... I mean, I guess Thursday is a going out night?  Maybe?).  We decided to sit at the bar overlooking the kitchen and just get a snack.First of all, the menu is huge!  We had a tough time choosing just one thing.  We ended up going with the chili cheese fries.  O.M.G.  They were amazing.  I forget the price, but I remember it being on the pricier side, as were the beers (although they had a good selection with plenty of local beers).  I'd like to go back and check out some more of their menu.  This would be a great place for a first date (cool, laid back atmosphere with legit food) or the start/end of a night out with friends."
"Great service, great experience. Can't wait to take the 1 yr old out w/ me again!"
"We visited Little Goat last Saturday. Got reservation at 10:00pm...gives you an idea how popular the place could be on weekends. It's hardly  your typical diner, yes there are booths, but its kinda upscale-ish. The items listed under Breakfast are always available even if its midnight! I ordered a Spanish Omlette & my picky two yr old finished it all in no time!! The Pork Belly Pancake, was the best. Oh it was heavenly!!My dear husband loves burgers. So he ordered the Goat Almighty, and yes he needed my help to finish it!! The portion sizes are generous indeed. Dollars well spent. :-) The ambience reminded me of another favorite restaurant of ours, Local Three of Atlanta. It's casual, noisy but great food.Can't wait to visit Ms Izard's another child---The Girl and the Goat, just across the road of this one!"
Breakfast served all day!!! YES!!!I was nervous at first because it was crowded and online it did not look like a baby friendly place...but it was! A bit loud...but tons of action for kids to look at. Such a bright place you can't help but instantly feel more awake in there. Well I love eggs and well the menu is very meaty....so there wasn't much I could pick from..but for everyone else...you should check out the menu online before you go...so you can get a glimpse of the interesting choices and come up with a game plan! We ordered tempura mashed potatoes as a side. A MUST TRY!I ordered the Spanish omelette and it's a bit like chilaquilles. So good but wow the plate was huge and I was full very fast! Worth the 1 hour wait? Yes!!!
Korean goat burger and Los Drowned sandwiches were amazing! Service and atmosphere were great. Will be back...
"Not impressed with this place, given its relationship to the incredibly hyped sister restaurant G+tG.Between the brandade + belly and the pork belly pancake, the waiter recommended the former. It was impressively presented but disappointing once I dug in. Two tiny pieces of pork belly that weren't very flavorful, biscuits that were firmly on the dry side, and an assortment of veggies & under-fermented kimchi that made me glad that I was eating my greens but offered very little in terms of flavor. Wished I had given the more popular pork belly pancake a try, but skeptical whether I would have come to a different conclusion.I also got a cinnamon bun and some smoked fries. The bun is certainly better made but, if I'm honest, not actually more satisfying than what you could find at Cinnabon. The smoked fries were an incredibly disappointing small cupful of average fries that barely had any smoke flavor -- hardly worth 3 dollars in my opinion, much less the $6 they actually charged.Service was slower than expected on a Saturday morning. We were waiting for water for what must have been close to 10 minutes after we were seated. Overall a pretty underwhelming experience that doesn't leave me craving a second visit, especially given the incredible array of great food Chicago has to offer."
"Interesting menu, beautiful space, great energy and diverse crowd.  I ordered the paratha egg dish and liked it a lot.  I would return!"
"The West Loop in Chicago is a gem of a place and Little Goat embodies that better than any other place. The hardest thing in your day will be to choose from their amazing menu. I had the Blue Plate Special, a very original version of a ropa vieja, a festival of flavors and colors that is literally beyond description in the form of words.The place has a perfect decoration, beer selection is great, the service is uber-spectacular (Megan is the best!) and if I were to live in Chicago I'd risk going there every other day.Stephanie Izard is a culinary genius and you absolutely need to check this place."
"The food at little goat was absolutely amazing! The Mac and cheese was to die for!  It had a very original and unique taste.   It was so great we forgot to take a pic of it! Also, we ordered the Tuna melt.. Oh so good!  It was unique as well and the best tuna melt I've ever tasted.  We also ordered the smoked fries and chicken fingers.... Another great pick! Yum yum!  I must say the bbq sauce that comes with the chicken fingers was wonderful. It made my chicken fingers 100% better... If that's even possible!!  I love it here and will definitely recommend this restaurant!  A+"
"I stopped by Little Goat Bakery this past weekend after hearing they were debuting some new sweets. I picked up a chocolate whoopie pie, honey graham cupcake, and coffee cake muffin. The whoopie pie was superb! Five stars for this confection. The cake portion was chocolatey and moist and the chocolate cream had a nice, light texture and great chocolate flavor as well. Neither component was too sweet either. The honey graham cupcake was good. The crumb was more rustic compared to the dense, fine crumb of the cupcakes at Sprinkles. The texture of the frosting was also lighter and not as sweet as Sprinkles' frosting so some may prefer the cupcakes here. The other cupcake option this past Saturday was Mexican chocolate. The coffee cake muffin tasted as you would imagine a coffee cake in muffin form would. I liked the abundance and large size of the crumbles atop the muffin, and the flavor was enjoyable with the rivers of cinnamon throughout. However, the cake portion of the muffin was a touch more dry than I would like. If you want an awesome muffin, head over to the bakery counter at Summer House. I love their banana muffin and pumpkin muffin. There were a couple other muffin options for sale I believe, one of which may have been gluten free. A common theme I noticed after noshing everything I bought was that nothing tasted overly sweet. I really appreciated that because I love sweets but I don't want to necessarily feel like I swallowed a bag of granulated sugar when I eat treats. The three items together were about $8 which I felt was very fair for the size and quality of the items I purchased. I will definitely stop in again for that whoopie pie and to try some other bakery items. Recommend!"
"This place was charming.  Diner decor, with a twisted diner menu.  The staff was pleasant and attentive.My daughter couldn't decide between a cinnamon bun and the dark chocolate chip pancakes, so I allowed her to order both.The cinnamon bun was not warm and gooey, as you might expect.  It was cold, and not really appetizing.The dark chocolate chip pancakes had a strangeness to them.  They just weren't that good.My son ordered Fat Elvis Waffles, which seemed soft.  No crispness at all, almost as if they were prepared in advance and then microwaved.  He devoured them, though, so couldn't have been all that bad.I ordered Little Piggy Went to China, which was fabulous!We went in on a weekday, right as they opened (7 AM), and there was no wait.  This place is definitely worth a try.  Though some of the dishes weren't as expected, I have to give this place an extra star for the inventiveness of the menu."
"I go here for breakfast and it's wonderful! My go to dish is their Bull's Eye French Toast. So good! I've actually still never been for lunch, but i'm sure it's great too. The ""little goat"" coffee is also excellent, which has goat milk in it. Give this place a try if you haven't yet, you won't be disappointed!"
We came in here for a quick stop to get lattes. I don't really like hot coffee (all about that iced) but I tried my friend's latte and it was delicious! There is a line though so be prepared to wait like 10-15 min. There's not really any spots to sit down. This is a good place to stop by and get something to drink while you're waiting for the restuarants in the area to call you for your table.
"Underwhelmed...The menu reads deliciously but the execution is lacking. My fried chicken was supposed to have a breast, wing, and leg. The leg was missing the thigh - perhaps a typo? Had a light and flaky coating but lacked seasoning. Breast was dry.Mac 'n' cheese was nothing special. Cavatappi in a thin cheese sauce which was sitting at the bottom of the bowl. The top pieces got no love.The club sandwich was the best of the food we ordered but I've had better.IMHO, Stephanie needs to get back into the kitchen because I absolutely LOVE Girl and the goat.The service, although friendly, was very spotty and impersonal. The best part of LGD is the bustling bright atmosphere and a diverse mix of tune from Ella Fitzgerald to Led Zepplin."
"Great place. Service is awesome and the food is delicious, but a little greasy. Well, I say it is worth the heart attack! Avoid weekends and holidays. Best to have an Opentable reservation ahead of time!"
"Headline -- Love the casual diner feel of this place -- food to bar to peaking into the bakery was a totally cool experience. Food was pretty yummy. Service was great!When we arrived there was a 20 minute wait, so we headed to the back to grab some drinks. The bartenders were super cool, pretty patient even though they were slammed, and knowledgeable about the drink menu. 20 minutes flew by between good conversation and great people watching, but there was still no table, but we saw that the countertop open up and we were sold to have dinner there. Our server was fantastic and all knowing when it came to helping us narrow down our selections. We started with the hot crab dip and the hash browns with cheese. Enjoyed that the crap dip was served with what..ritz crackers! Haven't had those in ages! Hash browns were just okay.. one and done kinda thing.Because our server knew the kitchen was slammed he wanted to make sure that we got our orders in and came back right after he put the first order in and explained the situation. I had the shrimp and grits and my dining companion had the pork sandwich with pickles, pepper, and pickled rhubarb.  Totally enjoyed myself and was equally excited that I could see all the pleasure of seeing the ""orders up"" My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach. Definitely will be back to try some other options."
"Was lucky to score a table at this packed place.  Didn't know what to expect so I ordered comfort food:1. mac and cheese - goat cheese!2. chili cheese fries - goat cheese!3. toast - a little sweet and salty.Overall, their dishes reminded me of the exercise video Insanity where it's taste bud confusion.  I never imagine how good goat cheese can be when used for chili cheese fries or mac and cheese.  I usually imagine goat cheese be used for salads."
"Love this place! I've been here twice now and have loved each time I've been here. The first time my husband and I went for dinner. We didn't have a reservation but was able to be sat in about 15 minutes. I ordered the goat burger and my husband ordered the quesadilla. Excellent food and services. Today a colleague of mine and I went there for lunch. We made a reservation but was late a bit, they still were able to seat us without waiting. I had the tonkatsu sandwich. ORDER THIS. It's so unique and delicious. MyColleague ordered the club sandwich. My only qualm is that parking is horrible over here. But that's Randolph Street for ya. I highly recommend coming here!"
"This slick diner has a wonderful throwback feel, that makes you think... just maybe, it's been there for 50 + years. One look at the menu lets you know that in fact, you're dealing with something brand spanking new. A lot of thought and planning has gone into both the buildout of the restaurant as well as the planning of the menu. Familiar items like a cheeseburger or an omelet take interesting and sometimes bizarre turns and twists. There is a playful element to everything at Little Goat, and I like the approach. But did I like my entree? I'm on the fence with that one my friends.For a first time visit, I wasn't sure where to start. The $20 goat burger was really sounding interesting, but then the waiter mentioned the evening's ""blue light special"" which was... deep fried pig's tail?! I have never had deep fried pig tail before, but looking at all of the delicious looking plates coming out of the kitchen, I wasn't nervous and took the plunge.Thankfully, I also got a side order of the goddamn delicious Eltoes, which is a bursting with flavor corn dish. Just like the yummy Mexican corn on the cob you might pick up for a road side vendor, this corn was cut from the cob and served up HOT, with a tangy and appreciated brightness. The pig tail was served with an arugula and radish salad tossed about the plate, as well as something that was described as a chimichurri sauce that contained some nice chopped mushrooms and jalapeños. The acid of the sauce was needed, as the pork was FATTY. First bite in was a doozy. A mouth full of fat, no meat... just a mouth full of fat. Don't get me wrong, I love bacon, and pork belly, and pig fat in general. But a mouth full of pig ass fat was just overwhelming. It coated my mouth and took a few rounds of the corn to clean my palate.Cutting in a little more, and absolutely delicious meat appeared. All of the meat was just fantastically delicious and moist, but that outlet layer of fat was basically inedible and should have come with a warning! It was a delicious and dangerous dish, and I was slightly overwhelmed by it. I tried a bit of the indian Parathas breakfast burrito as well. The indian flatbread and runny egg went really wonderful with the cheese and chili pepper sauce.All in all, the meal was great, as was the atmosphere and conversation. Next time, I'm going to skip the special and go for the goat burger."
"I went to Little Goat for breakfast recently. We had to wait over an hour for a table, but it was well worth it! The service was great. Our server was very attentive even with how busy it was. Try the bulls eye french toast!"
"I went as a walk-up with my mom on Sunday around noon - we were told 30-45 minute wait but were seated within 20 - not too bad!Our food was delicious - we had the machos nachos (took 3/4 of it home - large portion), the cheese sauce used was excellent. Also, I had the bulls-eye french toast which was excellent (mine came with strawberries which is not noted on the menu for those that can't do berries) and my mom had the blue plate special - which she really enjoyed.  We did get a better finger sundae - mostly just to try the chocolate covered cheez-it's. All of our food was excellent and we brought a good amount home. The service was great - our server actually provided us with recommendations when asked (this is a pet peeve of mine, if I ask I really want to know). It was a bit loud in the diner so but not so loud you can't hear the other person. I can't wait to go again and try some of the more lunch/dinner foods. I will be going again!"
"I loved my meal at this trendy diner. I was visiting from California and had this place on my radar as places to visit. It was fun, the food was fun and good, the service was very good and entertaining. If your in the area this is definitely a destination place to visit."
"My experience started when I couldn't find parking anywhere close to the restaurant and ended up paying to park all the way on Washington Blvd and walked there carrying my 18 month old daughterThis place is a glorified diner. They serve diner favorites like pancakes, eggs and made to order sandwiches and dinners, but with a touch of class or fancy. However, the prices would indicate this place to be one step below a steakhouseAn order of pancakes, which consisted of THREE were TWELVE DOLLARS! If you wanted a side of bacon or sausage, it would be another SIX DOLLARS! Let's not forget beverages or gratuity either.The food wasn't bad by any means, but I have never heard of a place charging $12 for a stack of THREE pancakes topped with apples and fancy crumbs. Luckily I wasn't paying, otherwise I would have settled for a bowl of oatmeal, but I felt terrible for my parents AKA SUCKERS who picked up the checkIt's pretty safe to say I won't be returning. Even if I win the lottery, I will still have breakfast somewhere that offers convenient parking and pancakes less than $10"
"After careful consideration between myself and my Tuesday night dining partner, we decided that Little Goat was a ""must-try"".Not only does Little Goat have a diversified and extensive menu, their creations are delectably delicious. If fried food is your calling the onion rings and fried pickles are must try. They include a curry mayo that adds the perfect spice to to a sinfully yummy dish. As a lover of all things BBQ, I had to try the Bbq Pork Sammich. Boy did I make the right choice! The mixture of the bbq sauce and chipotle mayo made my tastebuds tingle! It was the perfect cap to my cheat day. The ambiance of the restaurant is a suitable place to enjoy with friends any night of the week!"
"Hi.. I don't believe I've ever submitted a one star review and it saddens me a bit to feel the need to do so, but never the less I feel somewhat obligated to do so based on, what I believe to be, potential health implications. I think that the picture I included says it all, but I'll add some written details.  I basically was served raw fried chicken.  My wife and I went to the Little Goat for dinner on what I believe was a Thursday evening. We were excited about it because we heard such good things about The Girl and the Goat as well as the Little Goat. The menu was basically glorified diner food which I was fine with as I haven't been known to discriminate against any food. I ordered the fried chicken as I was interested to see their take on this southern classic. The meal arrived at the table and it consisted of a leg, breast and thigh.  I began to pick at the leg.  It seemed a bit pink so I called the waiter over and showed him. He explained that the preparation involves par-boiling the chicken, breading it and then frying it and because of this the meat sometimes appears to be slightly pink but is indeed fully cooked.  First of all, in my opinion, par-boiled fried chicken sounds and tastes disgusting. It involves partially cooking the chicken in boiling water then breading it and frying it to finish cooking.  The result is watery tasteless chicken meat under what could be a decently seasoned breading, but that really never adheres well to the chicken meat.  It's not my favorite preparation and I suppose I was expecting something better.  Regardless, I would have been fine if I could actually eat the chicken. I gave up on the leg as I wasn't convinced that my waiter was accurate in telling me that this particular piece of chicken was fully cooked, so I moved on to the breast.  Chicken breast is supposed to cook faster so I was hopeful that this piece would be safe to eat.  As you can see from the picture, I was absolutely wrong. I then called the waiter back and asked him if he really wanted to stick to his original story.  He finally acknowledged that the chicken was indeed raw. He took it back to the kitchen and showed it to their manager. I was offered a new chicken meal but wasn't eager to take them up on it.  We weren't charged for our meal and the staff and management were all nice enough but serving a customer raw chicken seems like a big no no to me and suggests that there is a lack of quality control."
"An upscale diner with pretty bold food combinations. Definitely fulfilling, different, and something you probably won't find at any regular old diner. I came in for brunch on a Saturday. While we waited to be seated, we went to the Little Goat Bakery and I got The Little Goat coffee (espresso, steamed goat milk, whipped cream, marsala) and the flavors combine in a really unique way-- hot, a kick of spicy, and sweet. We waited for about an hour to be seated; our waitress was super friendly and attentive. Atmosphere is really laid back and you can expect every dish to have it's own unique little twist. I got the Brandade & Belly (brandade, pork belly, kimchi, 2 sunny side up eggs) and it was pretty tasty. I would definitely come back to try their other dishes; I like to look at other tables to see what other people get (lol) and everything I saw looked really darn good. My roommate got the Kimchi & Eggs & Bacon & Pancakes-- (the pancake is like the asian scallion pancakes-- not made with the usual pancake batter you might expect) and she really liked the flavor and texture of the dish. My friend got the Bulls-Eye French Toast (french toast, berries, fried chicken, a sunny side up egg, bbq maple syrup, and powdered sugar) and he was a huge fan. All in all, a good place to go! Would recommend & would come back."
Everything is good here! Love their drinks. The Mule is good! They have a great outdoor patio - they used to seat people on the rooftop but told us they are only doing private events up there which is a bummer.
"This place is so cute. It's ""diner-chic"" atmosphere perfectly matches the cuisine. There's even an adorable photo booth near the hostess stand. We ordered the goat chili cheese fries from the snack corner menu to share, and they were soooooo good. It kind of has some Spanish flavors which really worked in the dish. Then I ordered that night's special, the salmon. It was cooked medium rare which isn't something I'm used to, but the arugula grapefruit salad and the chipotle aioli made it really come together! For dessert we shared the passion fruit meringue pie. Order it. Please. Do it. It's amazing. The meringue tasted like marshmallow heaven and the fruit was perfectly tender. And the nilla wafer crust was of course, delicious. Perfect for a date or hangout with friends!"
To be updated later...
"This is not the place for you if you are scared of calories or trying to fit into a certain dress. The hash browns with gruyere - to die for. You feel your hips expanding with each delicious bite. The bullseye French toast is soaked in maple syrup with an egg with liquid yolk center on each piece. The bread part itself is like eating a sweet egg custard. If it makes you feel better, there are a few pieces of sliced strawberries on it. Oh yeah, there's also fried chicken on top. They offer chocolate goat milk. There is a bakery attached with $6 kimchi in a mason jar. This place is not Denny's or IHOP. The coffee is good. It's bright and lots of communal tables. Ripe with hipster servers, bus boys, and cooks.I would avoid this place like a plague during weekend brunch time as I can imagine, waiting for a table here is like world war III. Even though I am sure that once you do get a table, it would be a blast."
"What an extraordinary breakfast ! Definitely a place we would return. We ordered everything our waitress recommended  and was she ever so right! I normally do not even like breakfast food, but this was delious!!!! Very creative with an asian twist to some of the entrees.BULL'S EYE FRENCH TOASTeggs . crispy chicken . sweet onion brioche . bbq maple syrupBRANDADE AND BELLYbrandade . pork belly . sunny side eggs . biscuit . kimchiLOS DROWNEDbraised beef . havarti . avocado . pickled peppers & onions . spicy mayo . hoagieSpecial of the Day - Scallion flatbread...We arrived on a Saturday morning (10:15ish) and there was a 20 minute wait. Not bad. And we love, love their Stumptown blend coffee... So so good."
"I am one of the few people who has never been to the Girl and the Goat, but I can highly recommend the Little Goat for Breakfast.  Took the wife and the 5 year old, who loved her pancakes.  The maple and cheese sausages are a toss up, both are good, we were partial to the cheese.  I had the french toast which came topped with lightly fried chicken strips, wife had an omlette of the day which was crab rangoon and very tasty.  Very nice feel inside, like an american diner, plenty of seating but we went during the week which probably kept the crowd down, imagine weekends are crazy."
"Love this place, and don't get in often enough! The atmosphere is perfectly bizarre - it somehow creates a space appropriate for every occasion, from lunch with toddlers, to a Saturday night first date. The bar in the back is small but cozy, and the small, two person booths in the far wall of the restaurant offer a quieter, more private dining experience, as opposed to the long group tables. Little Goat has some of the best fried pickles I've ever had, for starters. I've also enjoyed the taco salad (no goat chili for me please!) a number of times, and it never disappoints. The tuna melt is also really really great, though very rich, given the unbelievable cheese on top. Everything I have tasted or people I am with have tasted has been truly great. Overall, a staple in the west loop strip of fine dining!"
"I love my brunch! And my trip to Chicago had to include some hot spots for some yummy breakfast food. This place is the sister restaurant of the Girl & the Goat and after trying that place we were excited to try the Little Goat Diner.Breakfast is served all day! :)Corned Beef Hash (very interesting, the corned beef was very tender and sliced thin very delicious with an egg cooked your way on top, the only thing I did not enjoy about the dish was the hash browns - they are very thin but very easily burnt when fried leaving the outside too burnt and the inside not cooked enough)I also tried the Bull's Eye French Toast ordered by one of my friends - really good if you like your chicken and waffles with a little twist. The french toast is a sweet onion brioche and very delicious with the maple syrup - great combination of sweet and savory. Asian Style Breakfast is another popular dish that my other friend ordered - very interesting and pulled together with kimchee!Great array of fancy breakfast eats :) though I'd personally skip on the hash browns."
"I was visiting Chicago for the Valentines weekend and was told to stop by here for brunch. Never have I been so impressed.  The service was amazing, the Bloody Mary was to-die for and the breakfast burrito... Wow!  It was unique, delicious and beautifully on display on the plate.  I would recommend anyone in the city or visiting Chicago to stop by, even with a wait, it will be well worth it!"
"not impressed, I had an over cooked sunny side up egg, how can you not know how to cook an  egg? way overpriced, coffee so strong it put hair on my chest.....sorry never again for me, girl at front desk pulled her skirt up all the way to hide her phone in her panties....... I didn't want to see her ass and v-jj, they should watch their video tapes, I crap you not.....not what I expected to see, this place is not classy."
"Stopped in for late night dessert after a meal at Sushi Dokku, and had a great time and great desserts!  The PB&J sundae and the pecan pie sunday were both wonderful!  Plenty of coffee, tea and alcoholic after dinner drinks were also available and it was really fun to watch the giant burgers and other diner-style-goat-influenced dishes go by and see the tables freak out by the size/presentation of the meals.  Looking forward to going back for the all day breakfast (I am a huge fan of brinner) and other assorted goodies the had on the menu!"
"The menu here changes every few months so I felt it necessary to update my review, sort of. I still give this place 5 stars because the food is always amazing.My friend got the Los Drown, and it basically looked like a French dip. The steak meat was fairly tender, the avocado topping paired perfectly with the steak. He demolished it in 4.5 minutes.  He also ordered a cookie shake and finished that in 2 minutes.My other friend ordered the chocolate pancakes.  She was not impressed, in fact it looked like the last few bites were painful. Maybe skip this.I had the shrimp and cheesy grits, and they were delicious!  I'm not really a fan of tomatoes so I pulled them out.  I also ordered the blueberry pancakes and loved them. The granola really makes the meal.My boyfriend had the sloppy goat and he says it was the perfect sloppy joe consistency.Overall, this place is amazing. As long as you skip the chocolate pancakes (apparently), you'll be ok."
"If I lived in Chicago, I would be here regularly.There is a rooftop bar.They serve breakfast all day.They have milkshakes.You smell sugar, butter, and flour everywhere.The pastries, coffees, cookies, will taunt you. The decor rocks.The staff is friendly.Libations? Yes.Bonus points, this girl Stephanie, was selling some of her wedding cake and it had cheez-its.  Chocolate marble cake with ganache, pb, and chocolate covered Cheez-its. Yes, unique and all that jazz."
"Don't get me wrong -- Little Goat is still good, but it has lost its 5-star charm to me. It's a combination of multiple factors:1) Environment - loud, communal seating area is all families with kids, so if you're with friends and would like to hear conversation2) So many flies swarming around my food all night, I had to keep swatting them away3) Prices - I used to think that this would be a more affordable version of GATG food, but it's not cheaper at all. Most dishes are in the same price range, and the portions are a teeny bit more generous but not significantly. However, the environment and food are significantly better at GATG so at the same price range, I know where I'd prefer to eat."
"So someone who loves this place for how cute it all is took me here and I had a terrible dish... I figured I ordered badly, my fault. I'd ordered a special omlette that was like Crab Rangoon style or something, just bad flavors together, and overcooked eggs and a soupy sugar sauce poured over it.  I figured I'd give it another chance since it's so fancy in there and looks like a good menu if overpriced. Took my girlfriend there for a late breakfast and we waited 1:30 hrs since they forgot about us and we had to go back and ask 3 times, and it's hard to hear its so loud in there. they really wanted to sit us at the ""communal"" cattle tables after forgetting about us anyway.  They kept apologizing for everything, great; just stop screwing up.Theres lots of hipster kitsch, like a hip decor based on the designs of someone who's 75 years old. The kitchen is one of those long things that runs down the middle so we can watch the 20 or so cooks like they're slaves while giving them no room to move at all. Did I mention how loud it is in there? They didn't think about any design just crammed 1000 seats in there with no sound barriers and no space to move between anything. It's amazing if you're one of the yuppies who loves the place and just bought a condo nearby after all that time in your Frat/Sorority. Isn't the big city exciting and different!? The menu is essentially fusion but they don't call it that. They were out of 2 things I ordered but it took multiple trips back for them to figure that out. I finally got some odd thing that was basically, a roti bread folded and stood on end with eggs under it, avocado, some sweet sauce garnish and a bunch of frisee on top. Really? does anyone try these things before they eat them? you can't just put together savory and sweet willy nilly and assume it'll be ""unique"" and thereby good. I wanted breakfast but everything is a la carte and they tell you all about it like that's a bonus. So it means I need to put together my own breakfast plan because they don't know how to do it. It also means every individual greasy thing is $5 alone so you can spend $25 easy basically just to getting extra oil and little plates for it.So some breakfast pointers: Toast is bread that is toasted. not grilled... toasted. it seems they dip the bread in oil and grill it then serve it a la carte. inedible.Hash browns are shredded potatoes with a LITTLE oil to grill it with not dripping with oil. was it the goat cheese mixed in? I don't know I didn't see any goat cheese in it, unless that little speck I saw wasn't just too much salt after all. Besides why would goat cheese ever taste good mixed into hash browns? I'm glad they screwed up that part or I'd be calibrating my pacemaker right now it was oily enough without the cheese.Anyway, obviously I'm bitter because I had a bad experience but I was polite and they comped my half of the meal they screwed up so much and I didn't ask for anything special. I kept wanting to like it, thinking it was just me. But what can you say? ""You seem nice, but can you please tell management they just F*%#@ed up everything? Maybe they should try a craft shop?"". The menu just isn't good. It's not thought through, it's overpriced, there are almost NO vegetarian options, bacon is a cool fad but it doesn't fix bad dishes, too much oil. It's feels like a menu made by someone from cooking school who has never actually worked in a restaurant or cooked for fun at home. TRY YOUR OWN DISHES, little goat. and expect to go for a really long run after that too. If you're in from out of town or you've bought overpriced real estate within a block of there you'll love this place. If you enjoy good food, prepared well and a relaxing, well designed dining experience don't even go near this place. (maybe try Breakfast Club, nearby. Way better, cheaper, better service)"
"Little Goat has the ability to make me cry. Not because of physical pain (even though I was oh-so-full), but I left with an exhausted mind after being incredibly overwhelmed by the sheer size of the menu and the incredible portions provided. My buddy Breanna B & I were practically shedding tears when faced with the decision of what to choose for our meals. I was almost incapable of choosing. But choose I did...thanks to our stupendous server, Carl.The decor is modern diner. The staff is incredibly welcoming. As mentioned, the portions are impressive. And the food. Oh the food is mouth-watering. The menu is filled to the brim with cool takes on diner classics - goat burger, mac 'n cheese, scallion pancakes, tempura mashed taters, hot crab dip and about a billion other items. Let me run down the list of items I sampled that practically popped the button off my jeans...*Bullseye French Toast: Sweet and salty at its best. Huge, thick slices of perfect French Toast topped with strawberries, bananas, syrup, egg and fried chicken. *Mac n cheese: Kraft who?! *Machos Nachos: Dayum, Stephanie Izard. Girl - you MAKE those nachos! Chips are piled high and topped with deliciousness.*Broccoli puff: A flaky pastry puff stuffed with creamy goodness and brocolli. This was still tasty, but not my fave.*Hot crab dip: Served with Ritz crackers, you'll want to dive in. *Crispy shrimp cocktail: I gotta give an enthusiastic nod to my girl, Candice G, and say yes, yes indeed this is one of the best items on the menu. It may sound basic, but the flavors are incredible. I would absolutely eat this for a main dish next time.So, you can see why I was full. Therefore, do yourself a favor and get ye to Little Goat with your stretchy pants and a few friends to share some plates."
Excellent corned beef! Rueben was nice and spicy. Great servers and a fun place for a diner!Breakfast and lunch items.Enjoyed the meal.
"Went there last night and ordered the Goat Chilli Cheese Fries & Korean Kimchi Burger.  Goat chilli and cheese and fries.  Yes.  Spicy of the chilli was mild, which I could have gone for more kick.  But then again I spent many years in Texas.  I liked that the goat was rough ground, so it still was a bit meaty and chunky as oppose to ground up so much that it would be like any other ground red meat.  So to me it was much more like a chilli con Carne.   The burger was off the hook!   Right blend of salt and pepper in the meat.  A fried egg.  Spicy kimchi.   Oh yes.   It was good.  I ordered the mac and cheese.  It was a good balance of of cheese to pasta shells ratio (which any serious mac-&-cheese lover can attest is a very delicate and hard science to balance).  I don't know if it was worth $9 at a ""diner"".  But there certainly was a good serving amount to be shared by two...oh wait.  It is Mac-&-cheese!   I didn't share!   Overall a nice update to a diner style ambiance with an eclectic and fusion menu."
"We had the great pleasure of visiting here twice on a recent weekend trip to Chicago. The first time, a Sunday morning, we were told it would be about a 30 minute wait for a table in the dining room, which I was expecting and wasn't bad at all - however, we were started to get hangry, so we opted to head over to the bakery + coffee shop side of the restaurant for a quicker meal. My husband and I both ordered a bagel with schmear (rye with sweet onion for me, and apricot with smoked salmon for him), which were both wonderful. The diner serves Stumptown coffee, so even the drip coffee is a great option, which sets this place apart from most other diners. We were able to find a seat at the coffee bar and enjoyed our bagels and coffee while watching the hustle + bustle of the dining room. (Had we decided to wait for a table, I probably would have hung out in this area while we waited a grabbed a breakfast cocktail from the bar, which all sounded delicious).We decided to try our luck a second time on Monday morning on our way to the airport, figuring it would be less crowded. It was, and we were seated right away, although the dining room was impressively busy for an early morning weekday. (I guess I shouldn't be surprised). I was worried they'd frown upon us having our luggage with us, but the hostess was very kind and offered us a place to set our stuff by the hostess stand. We had great service throughout the meal, from the hostess, to our waitress, to the servers and various others who picked up plates and refilled coffee. I love places that can strike that good mix between being friendly and attentive but not overbearing. I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles, which was two GIANT waffles served with peanut butter butter (yes, you read that right), banana, bacon, and bacon maple syrup. They were wonderful, and I loved the combination between salty and sweet. My husband ordered the blue plate special, which I assume changes daily or periodically, but on this occasion was a goat + beef hot dog wrapped in a pancake, with two over easy eggs on top and a maple barbecue sauce over the top. His dish was also quite good - we thought the goat hot dog was a unique spin on a classic, and we especially loved the taste of the sauce. Everything here is a la carte, so if you want sides (not that you need them - the portions were huge), you'll have to order them separately. We ordered the cheesy grits, which were indeed quite cheesy and incredibly rich - almost too rich until I asked for some hot sauce to help cut the richness. I was presented with two house-made versions, both of which were delicious and had a great sweet-spicy balance. I'm really glad we were able to experience both the bakery and the dining room at Little Goat, and it's definitely a place we'll be back to on our next visit to Chicago. Oh! And don't forget to pick up a loaf of bread to take home from the bakery as well - it's pricey, but well worth it!"
Was not impressed. Atmosphere is lively but that's about it. Server was unfriendly. Food was overpriced for what it was. Came into city for dinner and was a waste of an opportunity.
"Zel is the best bar tender in Chicago. Seriously, I've been you name it well crafted cocktail place and by far Little Goat is the least prententious and kindest. Regarding the food, this is upscale diner food. Milkshakes are solid as are the nachos."
"The food here was pretty decent. I got a table outside on a beautiful day and sat outside ordering a series of different plates!Their oatmeal I thought was pretty decent. It had honey yogurt, apples & oat crumble, it tasted like a big bowl of good mush. I also got their kimchi pancakes which tasted like korean Bin Dae Duk- savory and unique. They have a diverse menu and I may order a few other things if I come back."
"The Little Goat is absolutely fantastic. The ambiance is hip urban sleek restaurant meets mom and pop 50's diner offering eclectic twists on classic diner meals. Lots dishes with notes of asian flare. We showed up at 7:45 with a group of eleven and they sat us within ten mins on a surprisingly bust Tuesday night. The service was helpful, friendly, and attentive. The food was outstanding. The group ordered the crab dip, goat nachos, cheesy garlic bread, and chili cheese fries to start with. The nachos were just excellent. Cheesy, goaty, guacy deliciousness. The crab dip was full of plump crab and gooey cheesy yumminess. Specialty drinks we strong and fab. The Moscow goat was excellent and full of ginger beer spice. The pork belly pancake was epic. Seriously I almost licked the plate. The scallion pancake was cooked perfectly, the tangy house hoisin sauce with bok choy salad and ginger maple dressing added to the pork belly was just fantastic. The group also split the goat almighty. A HUGE burger with three meats: goat, braised beef, and BBQ pork. It was amazeballs. I'd eat here every week if I lived in Chicago."
"What a fabulous lunch! Everything we ordered was spot on and tasted perfect. It was extremely busy- but the waitstaff did a great job making sure everything ran smoothly. If you are staying at the Soho House as we were (which is literally right across the street) this was a great place to quickly grab a bite to eat. Honestly, I didn't expect it to be so delicious or that the flavors would've been so layered and thoughtful! We definitely will make a point to go back and try some other things off the menu."
"An upscale diner-style restaurant, Little Goat exceeded my expectations and has the lead on my ""regular"" place when visiting Chicago. The interior is a very cool take on the American diner, particularly the leather banquette style shaft that housed the rotating door. The menu items were all innovative and sounded delicious.We went there around brunch, and so I had the Brandade and Belly -- which is essentially an eggs benedict ""inspired"" dish: sunny-side up eggs, pork belly, kimchi on a flaky biscuit. Although that might sound very precious, it was delicious. And normally I put the disclaimer that pork belly is cheating... but frankly the dish was lick-the-plate good before I even hit a bit of the pork.My wife's pork belly pancakes (yes, I know we went pb crazy) were fantastic. Basically it is an asian-style scallion pancake that is traditionally married with savory foods and it too was piled-high with kimchi slaw. It was also wonderful. The kimchi for both dishes wasn't super authentic in that it was neither very sour nor spicy, but it was tasty nonetheless.We also tried the smoked bacon and toffee milkshake, and it was quite good. We were considering bringing a vegan friend here and expressed concern to the waiter, who immediately returned with an entire Vegan menu -- unexpected for a place with so much meat goodness; the items looked good and they had some interesting things like the scallions and kimchi pancakes which was basically my wife's dish minus the meat -- keep in mind both our dishes were delicious even independent of the pork belly.As a side note, we've been to three restaurants by Top Chef contestants (in this case Stephanie Izzard) -- two of which we discovered to be the case after the fact. Not one has been anything less than stellar, leading me to believe those guys do know how to pick truly exceptionally talented cooks."
"I am a huge fan of this place.  I love the décor, the service and most importantly the food. I ordered the crumpets and chorizo and my husband got the corned beef hash.  He liked his but it wasn't his favorite.  Mine on the other hand was fantastic.  He kept trying to steal from my plate which normally I would allow but not in this case.  I would have a hard time coming back and not ordering the same thing.  There's a lot of delicious looking things on this menu.  I will definitely be back to try them all!"
"A weekend getaway to Chicago brings out the ""best of"" list of what to see, do and eat. Little Goat made the list, and we trekked over for a late Saturday evening dinner. Since they don't take reservations, we didn't know what to expect in terms of a wait. Lucky for us, we went late enough that we only had a few minutes to wait before being shown to a nice, comfy booth that fit the five of us quite nicely. The wallpaper that covers the walls inside reminds me of something my grandmother once had, and the entire place had a somewhat cozy, homey feel to it.I had a really hard time finding just one thing that sounded good on the menu, so I took a recommendation from a friend and had the scallion pancake with pork belly and bok choy. I'd give it a 7 out of 10. I felt there was too much bok choy on top and not enough pork belly. The pancake was excellent though! I was torn between brussel sprouts with almonds and roasted root veggies as my side (everything is served ala carte) and the server recommended the sprouts. Good.. yes, but I think I might have enjoyed the root veggies a little more. I felt most of the flavor from the sprouts came from the salt I added to them, not from the sprouts themselves. In my opinion, this wasn't the best meal we had over our weekend getaway, but it was nice to try a new place out that was off the beaten path for tourists. I'll be giving this place another try soon.. maybe it'll be different"
"Best experience I hAve ever had! Great service, phenomenal food, great textures, unique and TOTALLY worth it!"
"Yum. I've been here countless times. Brunch, dinner, bar, booth, pastries. I've done it all. I haven't loved everything I've had, but most things are quite good. I especially like to stop and have a drink at the bar. Their bartenders are super friendly and know what they're doing. Favorite food items are the Sloppy Goat, Machos Nachos, and the Mac 'n Cheese. One thing I didn't really care for was the Biscuits and Gravy. I'm tough to please on that front though."
"Aside from the fact that I love the fabulous interior and the branding of this place, I couldn't stop saying ""wow"" to everything that kept coming out and and going in my mouth. At a group dinner, I think my dining partner next to me must have thought i was insane and probably wished I would just shut up so he could enjoy his own meal...ha!The benefit of dining in a large group means there are plenty of appetizers (snacks) to go around. We ordered the following starters to share:* Hot Crab Dip: Not sure about the Ritz® crackers.* Fried Pickles & Onion Rings:I tried the pickles, and in writing this I wish I had a plate of them in front of me right now! Oh wow, it was my first fried pickle...ever...and I want more. Tangy in a perfectly salted batter.* Crisp Shrimp Cocktail: I didn't try these, but the noodle wrapped shrimp presentation was beyond divine.* Machos Nachos:The name indicates a certain nacho sophistication. The homemade corn tortillas were memorable.* Side of Mac 'n' Cheese:It was just okay for me. Compared with the other foods, I found it to be bland. * Side of Pork Baked Beans:A tangy/sweet blend of yumminessFor those of you who've dined here, you know that the above list is more than a lot of food to go around prior to actually getting to the meal. Yes, I was more than stuffed and aching in delight by the time I got around to my Sammiches, so they came home with me. I did a plate share with one of my co-workers. We shared the Reuben with smoked corned beef and the Los Drowned with braised beef. Wow wow wow! I'm glad I had a couple bites of each before I packed 'em up to-go. The Reuben was salty/smokey in flavor and piled high with ingredients and the Los Drowned with a side of au jus was loaded with this pieces of beef. I remember looking across the table at another coworker, and she had the look of pain on her face as she looked down at her chicken with waffle meal (wonderful pain that is). We were just SO STUFFED! Note: They have a Green River drink here. I didn't get it, but I wish I did. Talk about nostalgia and remembering being with my parents as a kid while they ordered these with Brown Cow shakes. Our server was terrific. He immediately asked whether anyone at our table had allergies. This was a first. I have a soy allergy, so he immediately went back and made sure to come tell me what dishes I might want to stay away from. Dining here is an experience. If I lived in the city I would no doubt come here often. But, for now I'm glad that it remains a special treat."
"Food was excellent my Veggie quesadillas was delish and the portions are very good, I was full the whole day. The service was OK, but not great. I'm excited to come back and perhaps try the roof. The roof is first come first serve. I would recommend getting up to the roof early if you want a seat. We also had a Moscow goat and it was refreshing! Fabulous outside dinning options and cute indoor booths are also available. :-D"
This is one of the best cubano sandwiches I have ever had.  The pork belly was grilled and 1 inch thick and the ham was fresh shaved off the bone.  Amazing sauce and great bread.The shrimp sandwich is also a must have!!!Highly recommend!!!
"I've given this place about four tries and decided I don't understand the hype. The drinks are meh (except the bloody Mary because it clearly tastes like it has kimchi in it and I do love kimchi) and way too sweet. Really overpriced for what you get. Most dishes are pretty heavily oversalted as well. It has a hip vibe that I understand helps but the service has always been uniformly sub par, inconsiderate and slow. Just doesn't have the finesse and thoughtfulness I expect from Stephanie Izard.P.S. Was invited to a massive corporate dinner in the private dining room upstairs. The course menu was basically Girl and the Goat's food, and was amazing. The ambiance of the private dining room is also great - rustic, cozy, and intimate."
"I had heard a lot of hype about this diner before getting to experience for myself today. Love the atmosphere and adjourning bar/bakery. It is nice to have the option to grab a drink while waiting for a table. The food here is unique, creative, and delicious. This is definitely the perfect spot of a brunch on the weekend."
"What's that? We're eating at Little Goat, ya say? Huh, I'm pretty sure I've heard of it...and now, well now, dear readers, I'm pretty sure I'll never forget Little Goat and here's why:-sleek diner vibe that cleverly teeters between classy and casual all rolled into one (be sure to step next door and check out the bar area with bottled made in-house products)-we're talking scallion pancakes topped with pork belly, tempura mashed potatoes topped with Asian bbq and fresh sweet corn off the cob mixed herbs and who knows what else that made it mind-blowingly delicious and refreshing.  -who says you have to blow a shitload of money for awesome eats? Dishes at Little Goat fall in the $13 - $17 price range and will knock your socks off twice as fast as those highfalooting restaurants with a heavy sticker price-open kitchen with a classic diner-style pass through window for high visibility-bottom line: Can't wait to take all of my friends here. Good news is, it's close enough to the core of downtown that you can easily walk or cab it over."
"LOVE this place! Great atmosphere and amazing food!This is considered a diner, but the menu is very innovative and the atmosphere is trendy and classy. The menu is huge- everything from breakfast to dinner. My mom and I finally narrowed down the choices to 3 items and our  waitress helped us choose 2 items - los drowned and the pork belly pancake. After we ordered, Rod Stewart walked past our table on his way out and my mom embarrassingly chased him down for a picture. After this she said she was too excited to eat, but as soon as the food arrived her appetite quickly returned! Everything was delicious and the portions were generous. I will definitely be back so I can explore the rest of the menu!"
The Haunted House they put on upstairs was amazing. Check it out next year!
"We came around 1pm on saturday and were told that we need to wait for another hour.So we went to the roof first. Nice place with good drinks.We, two people, shared three entrees. FORK PORK CHOP & BOO BOO BAISE.. are both very tasty. and we ordered a brunch entree. Felt very full after our lunch. so we couldn't try their dessert.."
"(insert plethora of thumbs up & happy face emojis) IN LOVE 1.) Get reservations. There will always be a wait. 2.) Drinks: ""Moscow Mule"" & the ""Rosemary Daly"" are both excellent choices. 3.) Food: ""Spanish Omelette"" 4.) BRUNCH BRUNCH BRUNCH. Happened to go on a day in early September when a herd of teenagers dressed in janky rave attire where passing by to attend ""North Coast Music Festival,"" which proved to be excellent entertainment for anyone sitting outside.5.) This is just one of several outstanding places in the area. If you're heading to Au Cheval & experience a wait, meander over to Little Goat & have a drink at the bar. 6.) There is a rooftop, albeit it's tiny & not particularly noteworthy. Intimate ambiance."
"This is the most legit foodie experience I've had in Chicago. This is how it goes, I was trying to book a group dinner for the girl and the goat and that was was booked 3 weeks back, lord! So I decided a week in advance to come to do a late brunch here with just 2 friends, reserved on open table just in case. I'd say the biggest complaint I have is this place is a bit lacking on customer service. If I can recall from top chef, a great restaurant is superb food, service and ambiance. This place is lacking in service. I made a reservation on open table but I might as well not have. When it was our time we still had to wait, they also would not seat you if you made a reservation until everyone in your party is there.Now on to the food. Oh lord, this place delivered above and beyond. Every bite was food-gasm. My pork belly pancakes were sooo delicious, the pork tender, with just the right amount of fat, a good balance of freshness, citrus and very bold flavor. Perfect texture, some crunch in there with the slaw. The slaw was not over powering which I'd had at some wannabe restaurants. The pancake is not actually pancake, this whole dish is salty. The pancake was very think, the pancake taste a bit weird at first but heck, I am not gonna complain, it was probably just my subconscious going crazy because of the good food. I also ordered the potato tampura, sooo rich and soo good.  The fish tostada was also very fresh and flavorful. The dessert were good, but not as good as the entree, got the cake of the day which was mexican cinnaon and the sundae. The cake has the most amazing whipped cream that is homemade to the perfection. The sundae has chocolate dipped tortilla chips, and it is very savory because there is salted caramel and nuts. Third friend ordered the veggie burger and she said everything was homemade and the presentation was definitely wow.The bathroom of the place is in the back left corner, blends in with the wall paper. You go in and instead of a bathroom for women and men, there are 2 women bathrooms and 2 men. Very interesting. For the most part, cleanliness well maintained. I also liked that they allowed us to split our checks however we wanted, instead of some strict rules that are unnecessary. This place is just across the street from the girl and the goat, and it is connected to a bar and a coffee house that is also affiliated with the girl and the goat. You can buy some souvenir or cookbook while you wait for a table. Oh the cutest part is, well of course everything has a goat on here if you order a drink or something, but I think the cutest part is there are individual coat hooks by each booth :)"
"Atmosphere is cool, as you'd expect. Long Island had an odd taste and by far not the best I've had around. The nachos....yep, they are as freaking amazing as everyone says. So much so we wanted to take the scraps left on the plate home with us...which you just never do with nachos (do you?) My hopes and dreams were then shattered with my mushroom burger. The medium beef patty I ordered came out mid well at best and had a severe lack of seasoning. Damn you line cook!!!  Damn you!  My partners patty melt had the same issue. The server was great and apologetic.  Nothing to argue about, it was way overcooked. The offer was made to redo and I declined. Just suggested  to help the cook learn from the mistake. I have no patience to wait on another and my appetite isn't that big. Ok....that's my experience out of the thousands out there. Bottom line...just go and have your own discovery and experience. You have to."
"Tasty place for breakfast/brunch if you're like me and don't actually like traditional breakfast/brunch foods! True to its diner concept, you can get breakfast all throughout the day/night. Expect a fusion of all great cuisines.The shrimp and cheesy grits was a the perfect breakfast offering -- creamy grits, plentiful rock shrimp in a lively tomato sauce, with braised pistachio and leaves of brussels sprouts. Slightly more traditional breakfast options included a play on chicken and waffles -- that is, the fluffiest french toast (ever) with chunks of fried chicken, strawberry and bbq maple syrup. If I HAD to eat french toast for breakfast, I wouldn't want it from anywhere else. Don't forget to try to The Little Goat: espresso, chai spices and goat's milk. Hats off to Stephanie Izard for yet another great place to enjoy the company of friends and delicious food in Chicago."
"Why do I keep giving Chef Izard's restaurants a chance? Each time has been a huge disappointment. Let me start this review by saying that I did not enjoy Girl and the Goat. The service was excellent but the food was SO salty that I couldn't finish even one dish. It's been about a year since that experience and I finally decided to give Little Goat a try. Luckily, a girlfriend was visiting me in Chicago and we were able to score a table with no wait. We knew we were going to eat a second dinner next door at Au Cheval, so we decided to share 2 smaller dishes. Based on reviews and our waitress' recommendations, we tried the goat chili cheese fries and the pork belly pancake. The chili cheese fries were nothing out of the ordinary. You couldn't tell the meat was goat and I felt that I could get the same flavor at any fast-food restaurant. The pancake was a savory mix of different Asian flavors. It reminded me of a Korean pancake (but not as good). I'm still not sure why everyone raves about it."
"How can you not love this place. Little Goat is a completely different place from Girl and the Goat, but it's just as delicious. I usually start each meal with their Moscow Goat and something from the Snack Corner of the menu. My favorite so far is the fried pickles and onion rings. The breading is light, but provides and amazing crunch. The curry mayo is also on point. The burgers and ""sammiches"" are loaded with flavor. Depending on what you're in the mood for, you really can't go wrong. The Los Drowned often makes an appearance on my plate, but I think my favorite is the Mushroom Burger. I just can't resist the mushrooms covered in cheese sauce.Also, never miss an opportunity to have brunch here. The brandade and belly is an excellent way to start your day. No matter when you go to Little Goat, you're sure to leave having enjoyed an amazing meal."
"I've got the same complaints about Little Goat as I do Girl and the Goat, only distilled into a trendy casual diner setting. Namely, Stephanie Izard's growing empire relies way too heavily on salt as a flavor instead of flavor as a flavor. Further, service is very spotty. And if you've ever loved spending $8 on bread, boy, do I have the place for you.It's not that Little Goat's food is bad. It just feels like it's not worth the cost or the hype. I'm also interested to know what Izard's obsession is with Korean food (see: Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing). Because of the Izard brand, I've been here a few times. From the tasty thing to the grits to the french toast (but, uhh, not the cinnabun), everything tastes pretty good but is just drenched in salt.In any case, Little Goat's diner-style menu will set you back only an arm; if you want to lose the leg, too, try to score those Girl and the Goat reservations. The open, white-washed dining area is particularly nice on sunny days, especially contrasted to Little Goat's down the street corner neighbor, the much tastier Au Cheval. So it's definitely a nice stop to make when you're making the rounds with your tourist friends. And despite my begrudging comments about the cost, the bakery actually makes some really fantastic breads. So there's that."
"This is a place I go constantly, so it's kind of weird that I am giving it three stars, but only about 60% of the stuff I've had here has been good. Stuff is either completely awesome or decidedly mediocre. The really awesome: the Goat Chili Fries are AMAZING, and big enough to be a meal. The parothas burrito is also awesome. The fried pickles and onion rings are great: I wish there were more pickles per plate though, because they're way better than the onion rings.The not so good: The Nachos are nothing to write home about, the Breakfast spaggetti is deeply weird, and not in a good way, and really fishy. The grits in the shrimp and grits are overpoweringly cheesy. But look: I'd give it 3.5 if I could. I keep going back here because there are things I like, I've just had enough negative experiences that I stick to the things on the menu that I know I like. But it's easy to get a table, bright, well located, and has a good beer list, so all in all, above average."
"Similar to a lot of the mediocre reviews on here, we found everything to be very salty. It was Sunday afternoon around 4:30pm and we had no problem getting a table immediately which was nice. My girlfriend and I had the patty melt (with beef) and the Korean burger (with goat) and split a side of fries. We both ordered medium rare, however, mine came out well done. The kimchi on my Korean burger was ridiculously salty. It made it very hard to enjoy or even taste the rest of the burger. My girlfriend's patty melt had pickles which were also too salty and took over the entire burger. Our mouthes were pretty raw by the time we tried to finish our burgers.The fries were the least salty part of our entire meal. But $6 for fries?I would probably give this location a second chance and maybe stick to something sweet from the breakfast menu. It seems like they should work on their pickling process. Otherwise, the service was decent and the aesthetic and vibe was exactly what they were going for - a diner."
"How can you not love a restaurant with reference to anything miniature.  Or some cute fuzzy farm animal.  like this:   youtube.com/watch?v=nlYl…Came here for a breakfast meeting with a colleague - repeat visit for him, first experience for me.   We had a veggie omelette and corned beef hash which was dyanamo, aside from the smaller portion sizes.  Washed down with some freshly squeezed OJ, it's like the breakfast of champions.  Service can be hectic and a miss at times, even during the week - it's an eclectic clientele list of white collared professionals, stay at home moms dining with their verbose 2-month old kids, and hipsters and students alike.  But why rush when you've got a cozy, bright environment to laze about in.  Tinned ceillings, cute and comfy benches, windows that go on for days, and just fantastic people watching all around.   I'd be back, I'd definitely try something else since it was good but not like OMG-I-JUST-HAD-A-RELIGIOUS-EXPERIENCE."
Great food!  The combinations of favors seem a bit weird on paper but work really well. Also there mixed drinks are good and fairly potent.
Still going strong:seafood fideofrench toast and chicken stripschickpea saladcrispy shrimp cocktail
"Great food and interesting menu.  My group of 6 walked over from Parlor Pizza after not being served for 30 minutes.  We arrived at 1pm on Thursday and we're seated within 5 minutes despite the restaurant being packed.  Our food was delivered timely.  I had the fish tostados (and previously I've had the sloppy goat, spanish omlet, tuna melt, crab dip and they are all top notch).  One dish came out slightly behind the others and they were very apologetic and treated our entire party to cookies when we left.  You can never go wrong with the goat restaurants."
"Love Little Goat - luckily we live nearby so we are frequent visitors here.A few really great standout dishes. The Fat Elvis is a must, at least once (we bring all of our out of town friends here for this dish specifically). And the bullseye French toast is also fantastic. Some of the other dishes are a bit more wobbly in execution and/or for more adventuresome palates, but A+ for not sticking to boring diner stalwarts. And if you are about the basic eggs/meat/toast business, they have the ""simple Goat"" on weekday mornings, which gives you that plus some of the best hash browns EVER for a special deal. It's off menu so you have to know to ask for it. It can be totally crazy on weekends and some weeknights, but we usually try to come on weekday mornings before work & have a great experience then. You may have to wait a bit on weekends, of course. It's one of the most consistent places in the area - and nice staff, too."
"I am glad Little Goat was there to catch the overflow from Girl across the street.  I've been wanting to try Girl & the Goat for quite some time and thought tonight was the night as I've trekked a mile on foot and in the rain with determination to get here.  But alas, the waiting list at the Girl was ""uncomfortably long"" when we arrived and so we made our way across the street.Little Goat welcomed us with open arms, quoting a 45 minutes wait for 2 people.  However, we were seated 5 minutes later, it was a miracle!  It was late, and we were hungry.Mac and Cheese $7 - It was cheesy (hint of goat cheese) mac with bread crumbs sprinkled on top.  Simple but oh so delicious.  My favorite of the night.Reuben $13 - Smoked corned beef, kimchi, kraut, cheese, mustard, special sauce, pretzel rye.  The first bite was extremely delicious.  I got bored by the 3rd bite, though.Kalbi Beef Ribs $18 - Dirty rice, cantaloupe and watermelon, crispy onions.  The beef had really good flavoring.  Overall, it was ok.The booth we got can easily seat 6 and was comfortable.  The service was very good.  There were free street parking if you want to drive.  It's about a 10 minute walk to the Grand Blue Line train.I love the creative menu options, but thought the dinner I had was a bit overpriced and underwhelming.  I might want to come back and try the breakfast dishes, if Girl rejects me again."
"This place is absolutely amazing. I dined in with two other friends early Saturday afternoon and it was packed about a 40 minute wait; however, it was well worth it. Very nice updated diner feel, great waitstaff and a vast array of variety on the menu. I tried the Grape Sac Sac (Korean grape drink with actual grape pieces inside), sourdough pancakes...let's pause for this one. I was reluctant to order these but our waitress said otherwise so I took her word for it and tried them. When I tell you these pancakes were THEE ABSOLUTE BEST. They were huge (3 stacks) fluffy but had a sweet cornmeal type of taste and the maple syrup made it even better. Okay back to the rest of my meal so I had two eggs scrambled with cheese and shared an order of hash browns. My friend ordered the cheddar stuffed sausage which she said was delicious, as well as, those epic sourdough pancakes. My other friend got the omelette of the day which was filled with a spring onion cream cheese, pea tendrils, bacon and shallots. It looked good and she confirmed that it was but the smell of the cream cheese through me off so I won't order it.All in all, great spot for breakfast or lunch, super great staff, nice diner appeal, great food and reasonable prices for being a restaurant on Randolph St."
What is there not to like about Little Goat? Went with a group last week as visitors were in town from NY. Nobody eas disappointed with the food and we even had leftovers. Look forward to going back and hopefully experiencing the new bakery items.
They dropped the chicken Sandwhich off the menu. It was amazing. Service was slow. I'm not motivated to come back though my prior experiences were great. Their food is typically all really good. Just a not so great experience this time around.
"Overall: Prepare for a wait and a loud atmosphere, but this is the best diner food in the city. A great option that is also reasonably priced.The good: Fantastic food with a ton of options. Burgers, salads, apps, breakfast all day, and desserts. Service is fast and friendly and once you order the food comes semi-quickly. Huge portionsThe bad: VERY long wait. Had to wait over an hour to be seated. All diner food, with not too many options outside of that realm. Nothing is healthy, so don't come on a diet. Left with heartburn. Very loud and hard to have a conversation at times. Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 9/10Food: 9/10"
"Went to Little Goat for lunch and had a short wait and was able to sit outside. It is always busy so if you don't want to wait then make a reservation. They take a little bit of a nontraditional spin on diner favorites, which makes it unique. We got fried pickles and I had the tuna melt which was like no other tuna melt I have ever had before. My friend had the sloppy goat which he loved. Would definitely recommend going here and I will definitely be coming back."
"The sickest sh*t happened to me the other day, guys. I was sitting on my couch late at night when my head started itching. At first, no big deal. I hadn't washed my hair for an extended and undisclosed number of days, it's probably just, you know, build up or whatever. So I continue to sit there and I'm working, typing away when this little thing glides into my frame of sight and then disappears. Maybe a fuzzball? A Gnat? I swat the air once as a precaution and get back to work. *Maybe* 8 seconds later, I see the spot again, only it's swinging... because it's a motherf*cking spider! Trying to eat my face. And it's so close to my melon that I don't even have time to freak out. I just start clapping both my hands into the air in hopes of nabbing it and smooshing it to death. And because I believe I was brought into this world to be a natural born (spider) killer, I succeeded. Dead as a f*cking doornail. ... But then... Arachnophobia. 2013. Starring Candice G. John Goodman is nowhere to be seen. It's all up to me. And there's about a million (like 4 or 5) little spiders coming down from the AC vent above my head. F*ck. Obviously those little f*ckers just got borned in there and I don't know if generic Target brand Lysol is strong enough to kill them all. And I have no idea how many are already nesting in my weave. Now I have to move. You can't undo that. Am I going have to disclose this incident to the next renters? What happens next? Where is my life going? I gotta get out of here. Gotta get outta this town. Far away. Far, far away... sort of like Jenny from Forest Gump. Far and away... but with less Tom Cruise & Nicole Kidman. Off to the city, where there are no spiders, (that's a thing, right) but there are goats. Little ones. And one in particular always knows how to cheer me up. Makes me feel warm. and safe. and at home... but sans spiders. So I make my way to Little Goat, which is a haul for me coming from the suburbs, but it fits both my main criteria of being far away from my apparently insect-ridden apartment and it's spider-free, to my knowledge. It's not home, but it feels like home. Better than home at this point, actually. Now, I've done this LG dance a few times so I'm pretty well-versed in what I NEED to order... brace yourself, it's a lot, but keep in mind that I'd just been through a very traumatic experience and eating my feelings was necessary. Get this: * Crispy Shrimp Cocktail - somen noodle wrapped shrimp, cocktail sauce, lettuce wraps. Best thing on the menu. Hands down. * Hot Crab Dip - served with regular ole Ritz crackers, not house-made anything, but the Ritz are perfect and there's so much crab that you won't bat an eyelash at the price. Totally reasonable.* Shrimp and Cheesy Grits - insanely good, very filling* Smoked Fries - meat-free, but tastes like meat in the best possible way and the bowl is huge.* House-made veggie burger with the Korean set - kimchi, bacon, egg, spicy mayo, squish squash roll... but I get it sans bacon.* Veggie Chap Chae - spring onion, patty pan squash, fennel, tomato, sheep's milk cheese, cashews. It's like a pasta-y thing, but it's super fresh, farm-y and full of veggies and queso.* Choco Taco dessert. Heaven in a float glass. Okay, okay... I'll admit it. I've had a dining partner with me on every one of my visits so I've technically split all this and I don't actually have the manly appetite that I've led you to believe I have. In fact, I usually have leftovers so this probably enough food for 3 people, but more importantly, it's exactly the amount of food a person needs to forget about a personal tragedy (Re: spider demons). Amen."
The shrimp cocktail was amazing.  The rest of the food I had -- cinnamon bun and a big salad -- was just OK..underwhelming on seasoning.
"Reuben is so salty! Looks good, but meet tastes like fatty bacon but without any particular taste. I don't get the hype about this place. Perhaps I should try more dishes. But again, not impressed."
"We went for late brunch on Sunday at 1:30pm and were pleasantly surprised by the short 15 minute wait. The chickpea salad was a delicious medley of kale, radishes, carrots, marinated onions tossed with montamore cheese & a light, tangy chee vinaigrette & served with a side of tzatziki. I opted to add grilled chicken, plentiful to make a healthy gal full & with all the leafy greens, it was easy to rationalise sipping on cava with a splash of orange juice."
"First time ever in Chicago and just stop by for lunch,by the waitress I took the the begyle beer and the Ruben sandwich and they both were amaiiiiizing,a totally different kind of taste for a great price"
"4.5 stars.  Very pleased with my experience here. We made reservations for a Saturday night, and were ushered to our table within a few minutes of arriving.  Server was lovely - nonintrusive, helpful in understanding the menu, and upbeat.  It really is a diner - there aren't any appetizers, no bread before the meal, etc. So ensure to set your expectations clearly before coming for dinner.  Best part: they have an all-vegan menu, making it not only easy to order vegan dishes but also means they are well thought-out and tasteful.  I got the blue-plate special, and it was excellent!  Drinks are strong, too.  Only complaint was that the scallion pancake (vegan) was way too salty.  But there is plenty on the menu I want to try, so I will definitely be back.Attire: casual, erring on the side of ""I didn't even dress up for this.""Groups: They have big booths that fit 6 adults or 8 kids + adults, small two-person booths, and a big long communal table in the middle.Reservations: I didn't see anyone without reservations waiting very long at 7pm on a Saturday night, but it was nice to have them.Kids: Many people had kids with them, seemed fine for all ages."
Excellent brunch food with unique and creative dishes. Wish the wait wasn't an hour long!
"I was a little skeptical when my friend suggested this place for brunch once I heard we'd have to wait a while for a table even at 10:00 am. It was worth the wait! I ordered the Bulls Eye French Toast with Fried Chicken and it's basically the only thing I can think about since. It was literally one of the best meals I've ever eaten. I'm not a huge fan of the bakery section. It's chaotic and disorganized. I tried to order a few pastries to take home and ended up waiting around for 10 minutes as the cashier seemed to forget about me, give me the wrong order and then not attempt to fix the incorrect order. It was actually sort of weird how terrible that part of the experience was after the fantastic experience on the dining side."
"I had the bulls eye French toast and I loved it. It was sweet and salty from the fried chicken, since I am a chicken and waffles girl this was a cool way to have that mix in a different way. Warning! I will say that next time I will ask that the egg be cooked to a firmer consistency because it was really runny like they just dropped it in there and warmed it up and I like a runny yolk but not whites. So, I left that alone and heated it up the next morning and it was even better."
"PORK BELLY PANCAKE!!!!!!CrAzY good!!! As of recently I have been trying to be a more adventurous eater (pork belly, pancake, whoaaaa) and ordering things that I have never had before. The flavor profiles packed into this dish were outstanding!"
"Love this place.I used to go there all the time for lunch when I worked in the West Loop. There is usually a 20 minute wait and they can text you when the table is ready if you don't want to wait there.This connects to Little Goat Bread so you can get a cup of coffee and other Little Goat merchandise while you wait.My favorite thing is the kimchi burger so that's what I usually get. I've also had the Italian beef and gyro and both were just ok. The mac and cheese was a bit bland, so that was disappointing. They do serve beer (and potentially other alcohol)."
"Came in today for lunch around 1-The place was packed! Considering it's an Izard restaurant, it was no surprise. We only waited for about 20 min, despite being told to expect 30-45min for a table (2 people). Love the whole atmosphere of the place! The decor is lighter and more whimsical than its goat companion across the street. Also, they have the bar/bakery area attached to the diner in the back where you can buy bread, pastries, etc. as well as have the full menu service in the bar area.The service was great! Our waitress was very attentive and super friendly! Not to mention the front-of-house staff was great and very informative. They have a great system where you leave your number and they text you when your table is ready, so you're free to move about while you wait for your table.The food was phenomenal! I had such a difficulty trying to decide on what to order, but ended up going with the porkbelly pancake and was definitely not disappointed! It was a scallion pancake with the porkbelly on top, then covered with a sprout slaw. The pork was super tender and paired greatly with the pancake and slaw! The perfect savory dish! Then I ordered the brussels sprouts as a side-and omygod. I swear the vegetables are always a highlight at an Izard restaurant. They were cooked with The Saute sauce and almonds and were perfectly tender and delicious. My mom ordered the apple-tomato soup and the Los Drowned sandwich; both of which she said were super tasty.  Cannot wait to come back and enjoy more of what the Little Goat has to offer!"
"Really nice spot. I wouldn't necessarily think of Little Goat as a destination restaurant in the Randolph area, but it is a nice break from the uber yuppy drag otherwise dominated by the other animal restaurants. The food is definitely more accessible price-wise and there is more variety than some of the other places. Think very well done classic diner food. My friend and I had the nachos which wow, look out, it's a HUGE pile of cheese, guac, onions, beans and several other amazing things that will fill you up in and of itself. We also each had an entree--I had the pork belly salad which was very excellent (a great counter to the heavy nachos) and my friend had the roast beef sandwich. Both were very professionally done with high quality ingredients.Overall, a very solid place considering its randolph location. My advice if you want to go is to go on a weeknight an hour or so before closing (around 9) and you shouldnt have any trouble getting in. This is also a great back-up if you're waiting in too long of a line at one of the other randolph restaurants (we had originally wanted to go to Au Cheval)"
Delicioussssss. So many options and such a cool twist on everything! Love the diner feel- very cute but again- cool twist!
Great service!!  Great food!!!  Just wonderful omelets (and I make a lot of omelets at home)!!!
"Had New year's Day brunch here. Really efficient reservation system so even on one of the busiest brunch days of the year, we were sat within 20 minutes of walking in the door. Food was hit or miss, should probably stick to executing simpler dishes better. Comfort food shouldn't be complicated. Coffee and bloodies were great. Service was personal and smooth. Get back to the basics on the menu and I will be here every weekend."
"Had my wife's baby shower there and we received unbelievable food, service and overall experience. Food wise, we went with the blueberry pancakes, corned beef hash, grilled cheeses, ham and cheese frittatas, cookies, veggie sandwiches and yogurt and granola. Each was slightly fancier than these basic descriptions but not overdone. There was no shortage of any dish despite 7 extra guests over the estimate. Everything was delicious. And empty plate didn't spend more than 30 seconds on the table and the coffees and hot water were replenished immediately. The outdoor patio was awesome and smelled like brownies from the nearby chocolate factory. We had 37 people show up even though 30 was the estimate. We weren't charged extra since it didn't get to 40.I'd 100% recommend this for any event!"
"Friendly service, fresh food. We were a party of 7 and all ordered different dishes: everyone walked away happy. The kale salad was out of this world."
Oatmeal with Greek yogurt and incredible soft latte - this was a total surprise and made my morning
"Diner food transformed!! great cocktails. Been here a few times and loved the paratha burrito, chickpea salad and goat chili. Hear they have good old fashioned, will try next time. Latte was nice."
"with all they hype around this place, I thought the food would have been better. Our bloody Mary's were too spicy ( and I like spicy) where I had to clear my throat and drink water between sips and too thick. I got ""This little piggy went to China"" and it was just too salty, the cheddar biscuit is mostly what I ate off that dish. My boyfriend ordered the ""KIMCHEE & BACON & EGGS & PANCAKES ASIAN STYLE BREAKFAST TASTY THING"" and again, too salty. We didn't finish our meals or drinks. Maybe it was just the items we ordered, but pretty disappointed to pay over $50 for a breakfast that we didn't enjoy.side note: we ate Asian food often, so i know that most dishes are usually saltier, but this was too much and there wasn't a good balance of flavors.We went over to the bakery after we paid the bill and got a sweet treat to appease our palates. The caramel and chocolate poptart was amazing. Next time we'll stick to the basics if we ever make it back to Chicago."
"It's always a treat to eat in Chicago and Little Goat did not disappoint. I found the atmosphere pleasantly casual, much like the food. Good selection of beers, and the fried stuff really hit the mark for me. I tried the veggie burger, which was one of the best I've ever had, albeit a bit messy. The fries were decent, but a bit thin for my taste. I like them slightly thicker, but to each his own.I really wanted to try a bit of everything, but at the least, it's incentive to come back. Which, I will."
"It's REALLY as good as everyone says! I had the ""Bull's Eye,"" Chicken and French Toast with maple syrup and egg in the middle, topped with fresh strawberries.  It was a beautiful symphony of flavors from the warm cinnamon of the french toast, with a slightly crisp edge and soft center highlighted by an egg coupled with savory and juicy fried chicken breast sweetened by maple syrup. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. Mmm, mmm good!  For dessert,  we had the cheeze-it sundae, yes,  cheeze-its! 2 scoops strawberry sorbet, one scoop cheeze-it ice cream, topped with peanut butter infused caramel drizzle,  whip cream and of course, chocolate covered cheeze its! Surprising it worked and flavors blended nicely.  Must go here and try.  Can't wait to come back."
"Eh- I love G&TG. Little Goat.... is ok. I'll be honest- I've been here 2-3 times, and I always seem to order what ends up being the messiest, soggiest, most deconstructed menu item.Or maybe everything comes this way. But I distinctly remember ordering last time some Mediterranean sandwich with chickpeas, etc. and it was a NIGHTMARE to eat. Good, but man!Last night I ordered the tuna melt. When it was placed in front of me, it bore no resemblance to a sandwich. Bottom up: plate, one (??) slice of good country white bread, very runny albacore tuna salad, white ""cheese sauce"" and piled on top with greens, some hard boiled egg slices, and cherry tomatoes.That's fine, but it was a nightmare to try and eat politely on a date. And it was way too soggy. There was absolutely no structural integrity to this sandwich, and I felt stupid and frustrated trying to knife and fork it.On the other hand, my date's corned beef hash was delicious.:/"
1600+ Reviews - 4 stars? I don't think I've ever been more disappointed. Just spent way too much money on bad food. Waited over an hour for the worst meal we've had on our vacation so far. Tonkatsu was super dry and tasteless. Slaw on the sandwich was so vinegary it was all I could taste. Bread was soggy from the sauce. Braised beef sandwich husband had was also dry and tasteless. Both our daughters ordered patty melts. Mediocre at best but mediocre was better than our meals so we ended up sharing theirs instead of eating ours. $5 side of broccoli was super small and honestly tasted like blanched florets (maybe a scant 1 cup?) tossed in rice vinegar and soy sauce with sesame seeds. Do overs??? :(
"Came here for brunch with my gf and a couple of other good friends and wow it was amazing. My friends got there early to put their names in so I only had to wait about 10 minutes while they waited close to 40-50 minutes (yayyyy friends :D ) on to the food though. I got the breakfast asian pork kimchi pancake thingy, my gf got the barade and kimchi and pork with biscuits, my other friends got the corned beef hash with eggs, the tonkatsu sandwich, and the super chocolately pancakes. The pancake thingy was absolutely delicious. Super fluffy with lots of kimchi and egg and pork belly with lots of scallions and mung bean sprouts on top. There was a type of fish sauce that came with it but I was happy without it, not because it wasn't good but because the pancakes were just really tasty. Everyone else was extremely happy with their food considering we were all quiet for the first 10 minutes after getting our food. Definitely cannot wait to come back here to try everything else on this menu"
"With a two hour and fifteen minute wait at Girl and the Goat our group opted for a shorter wait at their sister restaurant, Little Goat, across the street and a fun time was had by all.  Breakfast, lunch and dinner served all day with an absurdly eclectic menu with ""Cereal Killers"" (off the beat breakfast like Breakfast Spaghetti 'N Clams 'N Crab and Crumpets with chorizo maple syrup), Sandwiches, buggers, a section dedicated to taters (potatos) and dinner items with asian influences like Kalbi Beef ribs and Veggie Chap Chae.  It is a bit hard to figure out what to get since everything sounds so good.  Most everything we tried was good but more importantly memorable.  We all had a good laugh when the The Goat Almighty came out yelp.com/biz_photos/litt…   A goat burger stacked with  braised beef , BBQ pork,( it's like the turduken of four legged animals) pickled jalapenos, salsa verde, onion rings and cheddar.... I think the last time I remember a 12 inch tall sandwich was at Claim Jumpers which is now discontinued.The rest of the food was good as well like the simple Brussel Sprouts with Almondyelp.com/biz_photos/litt… which is light a refreshing.  The crispy onions and almond add a nice cruch.The Fried Pickles and Onion Ringsyelp.com/biz_photos/litt… had a nice zing in the batter which made it quite delectable.A couple of us had the blue plate special of the night: Diver Scallop with Brocollini an amazing cauliflower puree and of course goat in the form of crispy goat sausage.yelp.com/biz_photos/litt…  You definitely don't find scallops at your run of the mill dinner! However the most interesting dish by far was the dessert.The Cheez-it Sundaeyelp.com/biz_photos/litt….  Strawberry Ice cream with peanut butter syrup with dark choloclate coverd Cheez-its (which apparently was the theme of Top Chef Stephanie Izard's, the owner, wedding cake) with whipped cream.  I'll be the first to say this sounds weird but it's plays with your tastebuds in such an intereting way and grows on you the more you eat it.  When you  imangine peanut butter and strawberry jam ice cream with a crunchy dark chocolate pretzel this dessert begins to make a lot of sense.While I still do wish I was able to get into The Girl & the Goat the food at Little Goat is good, the flavors are fun and you can even buy goat swag if you're into souvenirs. yelp.com/biz_photos/litt…"
"We made a mistake of accidentally reserving little goat instead of the girl and the goat but still a very good decision nonetheless!!A very casual diner that has an American ""eat breakfast all day"" feel to it. And that's basically what the menu is. It serves breakfast all day BUT with a very interesting twist to all the dishes. One that caught my eye that I want to try is breakfast spaghetti with crab and shrimp (and served with an omelette I believe). Sounded great if I had a heavier appetite!!What we ordered and loved:Crispy Shrimp Cocktail: shrimp wrapped in fried somen noodles. These were delicious! It had a slight drizzle of mayo and cocktail sauce with a little kick to it that worked well with the super warm fresh shrimp and crunch of the noodlesBrussel sprout sides: so buttery tasting and yummy! Who knew brussel sprouts (something I typically don't want to eat) could taste so goodSeafood fideos: thin chinese noodles in clam broth wtih shrimp, white fish, and mussels. The noodles were the right ""al dente"" and the broth wasn't overpowering but still very flavorful.I definitely would come here for a casual nights dinner if you're hungry for some comfort food. This will hit the spot!"
"It's about time I made it to Little Goat! I met a friend here for dinner around 5p on a week night and at that time there was no wait and very few people already seated. If you're looking to avoid the wait, coming early will definitely help. We started with an order of the onion rings and fried pickles that are served with ranch and a curry mayo...because who doesn't love an entire plate of fried goodness?! I really enjoyed the breading and loved the curry mayo...great start to our indulgent meal! For mains I had the Patty Melt and my friend had the Pork Belly Pancake. Both were very good but we both agreed that my Patty Melt was just beyondddd! Big juicy burger, yummy caramelized onions, all between delicious, buttery, pretzel rye. If you're looking for the perfect hangover food this would be it! We ended with the Tiramisu and Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch shakes. I wasn't very happy with my choice of the smoked pork shake-I love my pork, but the smokey, bacon-y taste just didn't work in the milk shake. The tiramisu was the clear winner here.Obviously the food was outstanding and I definitely plan on returning (I NEED to try the chicken and waffles) but the only downside was our server. When we asked her if she recommended anything her answer was that everything on the menu was equally popular. When we told her a couple choices we were stuck between she said they were both popular. No recommendations or suggestions or anything. With such a large menu filled with a ton of appetizing options, we just would've appreciated a little more feedback other than ""everything is equally popular"". The whole time she just seemed like she was anxious to get us to leave so that is what really kept it from being a 5 star experience. Good thing the food is outstanding...that's all that really matters, right?!"
"I love this place, It's amazing, To me this Diner represents love, I feel it when I walk in. I can even feel love in the food... Love is also within the Diner's interior. The color's throughout the diner, composition of table's and the light fixture's and I love the circle window on the south wall of the kitchen. Everything is branded beautifully. You can also say I feel love at this Diner because of my boyfriend, he introduced me. About a year ago me and my boyfriend were out, it was late and we were starving. My sweetheart said ""I know, let's check out Little Goat"" and since then, We were both fans. Jason loves the Tuna melt, it's apparently the best tuna melt he's ever had. For me? Hand's down... The Chickpea Salad, the reason I eat and love kale. I mean it, When I think of what I want for dinner, it's this salad. I ask for it to be customized to my taste, respectfully and professionally they always help me out. Thank you Little Goat Diner!"
"I was so excited to go here as an alternative to G & the G.  Service & ambiance were great but food was very  mediocre. It has a cool, diner vibe and is very loud & noisy. The booth we sat in had a ripped seat and a big hole in it.  This was unappealing.  We had the crab dip that was good but not outstanding. We also had the fried chicken that was skimpy on the meat (does freebird mean skinny chicken?) and, again, not outstanding.  We tried the smoked pork & toffee crunch shake for something different. It had a slight pork flavor with toffee and chocolate pieces. It was tasty but a big soupy mess and not the thick, shake consistency that I was expecting. Glad I tried this place.  It has an interesting menu but don't need to go back with all of the wonderful choices on Randolph."
"Very good if you can survive the crowd; waited over an hour for a table for weekend brunch. However, you can grab mimosas from the bar to make the wait more tolerable. The food was great though; I still dream about that crab rangoon omelet that was a special that day, it was soooooo good. Also tried the French Toast, very tasty."
"They will tell you its an hour wait, but you will get a table within 15-20 mins. Just be there. (Unless its peak brunch time)Get Machos Nachos, this is fresh made Nachos with fresh toppings. Loved it! Great for sharing as its a huge portion. Now when I think about it, everything over there is a huge portion and meant for sharing and take home as well. Dark chocolate chip crunch pancakes is a must try and really good for dark chocolate fanatics. We were not able to try out Ooey Gooey Cinnabun as they ran out of it. :(But other yelpers say that its yumm...Not a great fan of Paranthas Burrito, Veggie Chap chae and chicken fingers over here. I would definitely skip these items and order something else.If you want to try something out with goat, go with Goat Chilli..Cheesy Garlic French bread is how it should be. Nothing special about this. For shakes, I would definitely recommend Smoked Pork & Toffee crunch. A must try. :)Head coffee isn't bad over there. Give it a try and you won't be disappointed."
"Came on a Saturday evening at 7pm, the place was packed. Loved the upscale diner look and was very excited about my meal.  We ordered the parathas burrito, veggie chap chae, and a side of home fries. All were decent. Nothing was horrible, but nothing blew us away. We also thought their dishes were overpriced. For the two dishes, the side, and a macchiato, it put at us at $40 without tip. We might come back to give this place a second chance."
"I recently discovered that putting beer in the freezer, while dangerous, is worth the risk.  There's cold and then there's ice cold.  As a matter of fact, our European friends at Heineken have stumbled on this truth and offer ""Heineken Extra Cold"" out on the continent.  I had the opportunity to sample this genius combination of beer plus extra cold while on a layover in Amsterdam recently.  Yes (thank you very much) extra cold is extra good.  Intrigued, I've gone to the trouble of researching the science behind this.  Among other things I've learned that:""No, some beers are not high quality enough to withstand such cold temperatures and they will taste more like water. Premium Heineken beer retains its top quality, excellent taste so you can enjoy it extra cold.""and also,""Extra Cold is chilled to zero for instant refreshment that lasts right through to the very last sip - so you can start fresh with every sip. It's no ordinary beer, so it's perfect for special occasions, and any time you need something refreshingly different.""heineken.com/global/faq/…Decent beer + extra cold = premium quality.  Noted.  It's funny how a smallish improvement can make a real difference.  It's a derivative of this thinking that permeates the little goat.  Why have a sloppy joe when you can have a sloppy goat.  It's a good sloppy joe, plus it's served on a nice plate and the atmosphere is nice and the waitstaff is nice.   Nice!  Or hey, how about a korean burger.  That's a burger with a bunch of extra cr@p on it, like Kimchee and egg.   Another genius combo that imparts sophistication on  everyday redundant fare.  I've had both of the aforementioned, as well as the chili and a few beers (sadly not extra cold).  All very decent.  In fact, arguably delicious.   You can see that there was thought that went into all of it. Here's the rub.  You'll probably end up spending about $25 each.  There's no sides with the sandwiches, the beers are pricey etc. So is $25 worth it for a sloppy joe and sides at lunch.  I mean, I work hard and you only live once and stuff.  It's tough.In the final analysis, I can't see myself coming here all the time. While I appreciate that they work a bit harder at giving you a nice classic meal here, it's too pricey for a sloppy joe or burger.   Maybe I'll start buying kimchee to put on the burgers I make at home.  I just need to remember not to forget the beers in the freezer.  That's a nightmare."
"I went here last Friday, Sept 19. I'm giving it 5 stars, but I wish I could give it 4.5 because despite the great service and INCREDIBLE food, because there were flies everywhere in the restaurant (and even a bee). Not sure how it happened, but I'm guessing they had their windows open earlier in the day and some got in since they don't have screens on their windows.The food: I got the pork belly pancake. It was amazing. The flavors were all delicious and it was a good portion. Big, but not so much that you'll feel disgusting if you eat the whole thing. The flavors were really fresh too. -1 star because the pork was dry though. My friends both got the sourdough pancakes. HOLY these were good. So fluffy and filling. I'd give them 6 stars if I could. We also got some garlic cheese french bread for the table and they were incredible as well. Good-sized portion and DELICIOUS and fresh marinara (big, fresh chunks of tomato and shallots instead of a sauce).I highly recommend this place. Make sure to get a reservation since they seem to always be busy. They serve breakfast all day though, so go whenever you can. Prices are fair too. Big portions for the price, and very fresh and innovative flavors. Definitely more expensive than your average diner, but you definitely get what you pay for and then some.Decor is nice too. Very upscale diner. The bathrooms are all single occupancy too (but they have 5 of them) which is kinda nice. Plus, the outdoor seating is really nice (though we ate inside)."
This is an awesome place for brunch. They make all their food with a twist and makes you feel adventurous. If you don't mind waiting 45 mins you will enjoy it. Also ask for goat milk with your coffee.
"Good, but Little Goat is hurt a bit by my sky-high-fabulous experience at Girl and the Goat.  Little Goat was good but not wowza.  Good food, fun atmosphere.  Long wait."
"Went there on a recommendation. The moment we walked in we exclaimed , "" this looks like an upscale, foodie diner!"" And that's exactly what it was. Inventive and delicious takes on classic diner fare and honestly one of the best restaurants I've been to in months. We started with brown butter pumpkin and butternut squash soup that was one of those dishes you just have to sigh and smile when you eat it. The goat chili was outstanding too. Everyone loved their dishes, cornbeef hash, butternut squash and fennel salad, and an inventive burger. Dessert is a must, with all their creative pies, shakes, and sundaes. We got the pumpkin Carmel corn shake, should have order two ! Always a long wait, but the great thing is you can put you name in and they text you when table is almost ready. Check out one of the great bars in the area while you wait!"
"Not sure what the hype is, but everything at Little Goat was just unnecessarily over the top. I ordered the french toast with fried chicken. It was sweet, savory, hot, cold, etc all in one plate. It was just way too messy for my palette! The ingredients did not mesh well with each other, and would probably not order it again. I think it would have been fine without the strawberries, and maybe less syrup? Most of my colleagues didn't enjoy their meals either, and we all ordered most recommended dishes. The shakes, also, weren't that great. The french fries were the only redeeming factor."
"This much-raved about diner was the perfect spot for my friend & I to indulge in some bad-for-you food over coffees.We arrived Sunday around 10:30 and had a 45 minute(ish) wait. The hostess took my cell number and said she'd text when our table was ready, so we walked a couple blocks over to La Colombe for lattes to kill the time. The ambiance is fresh and welcoming. Our server was happy, polite and willing to give suggestions. YOU MUST GET THE GOAT CHILI CHEESE FRIES. They are seriously amazing. As an app, there's enough for 3-4 to share.The French Toast (with BBQ maple syrup, fried chicken tenders & strawberries) was tasty, but just okay in my book. The chicken tenders were amazing though.We also tried the Los Drowned beef sandwich. Also okay. I liked the pickled veggies & slaw on top and the bread was really yummy.Everything is a la carte, so sandwiches don't come with sides.Based on the food I saw coming out of the kitchen, everything looked amazing. If I come back, I'll want to switch up my order as we were overwhelmed and kind of just went with the ""faves"" based on our server's recommendation. There are about 20 things I wanted to try (and wished I would have)."
"Phenomenal food and a spotless location, unfortunately supported by a slow, rude, and indifferent team of servers. The city already has a ""Dick's last resort"", come on goat, you are better than this."
"Wow is all I can say. Sort of like a night and day to it's mother restaurant. (Food was better and the price way better) The food in here was great. We have been for both dinner and breakfast and were extremely happy with our food. When we ate for dinner we got the chilli cheese fries (very tasty and the meat is goat) as well as the nachos (huge) Both were extremely tasty and fulfilling (we had 4 of us and we were all feeling pretty good when our entrees came out). For our entrees we got theAmerican burgers and Mac and cheese as a side. The burgers were full of flavor and big in size. The Mac and cheese was the hit of the table, very flavor-able. When we came for breakfast we came early (730am on sunday) and the crowd was still not picking up. By the time we were leaving it was starting to get packed (830-845). We each got the breakfast burrito which was extremely tasteful and large in size. We ate early and weren't hungry until after 3 ha. I highly recommend this joint if you are looking for good food and fairly priced budget"
LONGGGG WAITS... We waited for 1 hr before being seated and waited another 30 minutes for the food to come out.  The goat burger was nothing spectacular... overall I dont think this place is worth the wait and hype.
"Items selected include:Stumptown CoffeeOoey gooey cinnabunCoffee Cake MuffinApricot-masala sconeTempura mashed potatoes - Asian bbq, ranchBrandade and belly 'benedict' - brandade, pork belly, 2 poached eggs, biscuit, kimchiShrimp and grumpy goat grits - braised pistachio, Brussels sprout leavesBull's eye french toast - crispy chicken, sweet onion brioche, bbq maple syrup, eggsSpiced apple pancakes - cream cheese butter, oatmeal crumble, maple syrupFat elvis waffles - banana, peanut butter-butter, bacon maple syrupCookie PieSmoked pork & toffee crunch shakePeanut butter cookie sandwichChocolate chunk cookieOpen from 7am until late and located on Randolph in the Fulton Market there was little doubt in my mind that Stephanie Izard's second Chicago restaurant, the cleverly named Little Goat, would be successful and considering my single visit to Girl & The Goat I also expected the food to be bold, uncompromised, and delicious - the first two readily apparent the moment the website went live displaying a menu that read like Frankenstein mash-up of comfort foods gone overboard.  The question then became, would it be delicious - an answer I decided to find out for myself when I gathered up the family for early Sunday Breakfast.Arriving shortly after opening - a good plan considering the fact that every seat would be filled by 8:30am - and seated promptly at an oversized booth menus were presented and coffee was poured by a young woman named Yolanda who would prove every bit as friendly as she was capable of keeping my cup of Stumptown's Hairbender filled throughout our 90+ minute stay.  Selecting widely from the large and eclectic menu but requesting that food come out in courses I really cannot say enough about the pacing of our meal, particularly as it is in the restaurants best interest to turn tables given their ""no reservations"" policy, but in a word it was perfect.Starting off with pastries and the oft praised fried mashed potatoes I was particularly taken by the muffin and the scone, both available in the bakery/bread shop next door and both a fine balance of sweet and savory with a great crumb and plenty of butter.  Moving next to our primary plates, myself going savory for the first time in memory as the ladies each went sweet, I'll simply say that any chef willing to put brandade on a breakfast menu - particularly with pork belly and kimchi - has guts, and all my respect for making such diverse flavors work so well.Less impressed by the shrimp and grits, particularly as compared to those at Carriage House the day prior, but more than happy with the delicate pancakes, soft and savory waffles, and particularly the unique toad-in-a-hole-meets-fried-chicken-meets-­gooseberries-meets-barbeque French Toast; a dish that much like the belly and brandade simply defies logic in turning out so well.Clearly not skimping on complexity or calories in any way, desserts would prove equally interesting to the main plates and whether one opts for a simple chocolate chip cookie, peanut butter cookie, cookie pie, or defiantly excellent savory milkshake each one was resoundingly good - the entire meal easily warranting a return visit in the future and, despite the fact that I've never seen a single episode of Top Chef, assuring me that Chef Izard deserves every bit of the praise and success that has come her way."
"Ok so I was a little tipsy when I got here (drinks with coworkers beforehand), and I was starving - so any food would've tasted delicious.  But Little Goat exceeded all ravenous expectations.  I ordered the french toast (breakfast is served all day) which involved a fried egg baked into each piece of sweet onion brioche, accompanied by fried chicken and strawberries. So random, but all the flavors were wild when combined together.  The only downside was the extremely long wait as they don't take reservations."
"I really, truly wanted to love this place. I know it's probably our own fault for not making a reservation, but we ended up waiting over an hour to get a table, which is less than ideal after a night of drinking. When we finally were seated, we were left to sit at the table for another 20 minutes without water while the servers presumably were allowing us to decide what to order despite our extended wait. When we finally did have our order taken, they were out of three of the meals we wanted, so we had to resort to quick picks at the server's suggestions. The food that we did get was pretty good, but I wasn't blown away like I was expecting to be. I had the Parathas Burrito, and I ate the whole thing because I was so hungry, but I probably wouldn't order it again. I was still hungry after I finished and just felt like I could make something better at home. I will say that the goat chili is worth trying. It was hearty and had good flavor. My friends said their food was good, but nobody was raving about anything. I'd give this place another try, but I would try to arrive a little earlier in the future."
"I have decided I need to eat here every time I go home to Chicago. The coffee is super tasty, the staff is really friendly, and I have not been disappointed the 4 times I've eaten here in the last year.  The first time I had the Fat Elvis Waffles which were insanely delicious.  Earlier this week I had the 3 Sister's Farm Oatmeal and WOW!  I don't think I will ever have better tasting oatmeal than that.The only drawback to coming here is the horrible street parking situation in the West Loop, but that won't keep me away next time I come home."
"Took me a full two years as a Chicago resident to go here (after numerous friends raving about it) and it did NOT disappoint. Went for a business brunch and the atmosphere was awesome (even at 11 am on a weekday). Split the ""Fat Elvis"" waffles and the Parathas Burrito with a friend (best of both worlds) and they were both PHENOMENAL. My sister got a veggie burger and loved it.  Service was warm and attentive but not over the top. I will definitely be back!"
"Delicious, affordable and creative brunch - look no further than Little Goat!We got here around noon on a Friday for brunch and there was about a 30 minute wait for inside seating (they also had outdoor patio seating).  Instead of waiting, we decided to sit at the ""Bread Bar"" which is in the back of the restaurant.  The bartenders were super friendly, attentive, and very knowledgeable about the menu.  They helped us navigate the menu and even recommended some their favorite dishes.  The Drinks:I started with the ""Adios Vortex"" - a delicious combination of rum, amaretto, pineapple and OJ.  I thought it was really good, until I tried some of my boyfriend's Bloody Mary... It was delicious - I wish I had gotten that instead!  The Food:The menu is fun and creative with everything from traditional blueberry pancakes to breakfast spaghetti with clams and crab!  I wasn't adventurous enough to try the latter so instead I got something light and refreshing - biscuits and gravy!!  This dish comes in small and large sizes (naturally I got the large...), which turned out to be the perfect size.  The biscuits were large, fluffy and smothered in delicious sausage mushroom gravy.  My boyfriend got the ""Bull's eye French Toast"" - a combination of french toast, strawberries, BBQ maple syrup, and crispy fried chicken.  I know, I know, it sounds like a strange combo, but I found it absolutely delicious!  Definitely worth trying.  The Service:Can't say enough good things about it - we loved our bartender!  She was so personable, helpful and attentive without being too overbearing. Everyone here is very friendly and down to earth.Overall:Delicious and creative food, great drinks, and friendly service - a triple threat in the brunch world.  I would definitely recommend anyone traveling in this area to check out Little Goat.  Definitely get there early though to avoid a wait - especially on the weekend."
"Not bad and way easier to get in to than the girl and the goat.  I had the shrimp and grits, while good, I found the dish to be way too soupy.  I prefer a good helping of grits but the dish had way too much sauce, drowning the grits.  The highlight of the meal was the macho nachos.  I definitely recommend getting these as an appetizer or your meal."
"....Toffee pork bourbon milkshake, Toffee pork bourbon milkshake, Toffee pork bourbon milkshake...The Finale - Free Fallin'!Oh no...the ""Toffee pork bourbon milkshake"" chant again. Ever since I'd seen a fellow yelper's photo of this delight...the mental syllables running around in my head keep rearranging themselves into this salty mantra. So, what the hell is a girl without a goat to do when she finds herself lolling along one happy Friday night in the vicinity of the place where the actual ""Toffee pork bourbon milkshake"" comes to life? You guessed it!I insert myself into the one-and-only-empty-and-made-for-me-place at the Little Goat bar.  Seriously, I filled in the only gap left between couples and friends hanging out. It was a place no two could fill - only me - as if it were hallowed ""Toffee pork bourbon milkshake"" ground. So you can imagine how shocked I was - that when I ordered it...I failed to say aloud, ""bourbon"" at first. When the bartender repeats my order, only then do I hear the absence of the  ""bourbon"" and I say, ""It has bourbon in it, right?"" He comes back, ""Oh you want bourbon in it!?""  **Whoa, who would drink that without bourbon in it!?** I guess someone who doesn't want to pay $15.28 for a milkshake! LOL Normally, this over expenditure would cause me to freak out a bit. I mean..FIFTEEN BUCKS? Levity then embraces me and I'm 'Free Fal-lin' like everyone around me. . . Tom Petty playing, couples around me in intense in conversations that I'm not even trying to overhear: ""You know if a guy spends more than $100 on you...he likes you."" That line works and they are now exchanging a tongue text. Oh yeah, this is a good place to be and a milkshake to savor.  What a laid back but energetic bar scene, where people may just be falling in love. I recommend a visit here even if you aren't waiting to dine. It's small, intimate - just a row of seats at a bar - and a couple of two tops off to the side - couple of patio tables when the weather's right. (Rumor has it...there's even rooftop seating now.)Later in the week when I went back for a loaf of bread - something serendipitous happened and there I was holding a free loaf of bacon gruyere. Dollar-cost average that with the milkshake and It all works out. This place will do you right.PS I really think there should be four separate categories here: LG Bread, LG coffee bar, LG bar and LG Diner. There's so much goodness in this relatively small space!"
Had the best time with my girlfriend here today. It's her birthday. Couldn't do dinner because of scheduling problems so I was already kind of in hot water. The service made this a distant afterthought. Really went above and beyond. The food is outstanding. This place might be my fav lunch spot now.
"I'm a fan of this place.  Decor is super cool - modern diner and the menu is super eclectic.  I ended up going off the waiter's favorite - kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes, y'know the asian style breakfast tasty thing as it states on their menu.  I'm not sure if he recommended it since I was asian but whatever.  It was basically a deconstructed korean pancake for those of you that know what I'm talking about.  I should've known and ordered what my gut was telling me to try.  But their menu is sooo different and interesting I love it for that.  I can't wait to try other things the next time."
"Can't believe it took us this long to get here. Anyways went here yesterday evening for dinner. We've been to girl & the goat couple years ago- Stephanie Izard knows what she's doing. This place has that diner type feel except with an upscale twist. We sat at the diner table facing the kitchen. Server gave us some great recommendations: the bread of the day was coffee blueberry, I did the greek town chicken salad and husband did the pork chop. Amazing! Special pie at the moment was a passion fruit pie with Oreo crust. If that's on the menu when you go-GET IT. You'll thank me."
"We were seated behind the hostess at the long table around 1 pm after a one-hour wait on President's Day. Three booths had emptied and we were the only ones sitting at the long table. Since the cold air was constantly blowing in, we asked if we could move farther down the table but the waitress said another party would be sitting there. They didn't sit for at least another 5 minutes. When we were ready to take our order, all of the originally empty booths and the party of two that eventually sat at our table had their order taken first...We tried to brush off the mishap and focus on the food. I ordered the omelette of the day which had crab rangoon, and wonton. Others in my party ordered a breakfast burrito and the french toast. For appetizers, we got the brussel sprouts and the garlic mashed potatoes. We asked for gravy with our mashed potatoes, which never came. The food came out to about $21-$26/person which felt overpriced for the mediocre food and subpar service.. The food at our table that was not a spinoff of asian food, such as the french toast and breakfast burrito tasted better than my won ton crab omelette. As someone who has grown up eating all kind of chinese food, I thought I would appreciate it but I wasn't sure what they were going for. I'm glad I tried this place, but probably will not be back."
"YES Little Goat lives up to the hype. After living in Chicago for 3 years I finally made it to Little Goat for dinner with friends on a week night. I started with the Moscow Goat. the grapefruit juice gave the drink a little extra tang. We shared the goat chili cheese fries (a must order). I am so glad the 3 of us split the fries because I could of easily eaten the whole plate by myself! For my entree I decided on the fat club. The sandwich was HUGE and I was only able to eat half. A loaded meat sandwich with veggies, cheese and special sauce...plus a side of fries! As if we didn't eat enough we split the peppermint mattie for dessert. A brownie sundae with icecream and whip cream (think of a thin mint girl scout cookie mouth explosion). I honestly don't think you can go wrong with any of the items off the menu. My hardest decision was: do I order breakfast of dinner.Open Table: You can finally make reservations online instead of having to wait at the restaurant for a table, it's about time!!You will more than likely need to be rolled out of Little Goat after indulging but I think it's definitely worth the calories and money!"
"Loud, but delicious. Good for kids."
"Wow wow wow. I loved this place!I have always wanted to try The Girl and the Goat, but don't quite have the monetary momentum to get over there yet. My kid brother somehow discovered Little Goat before I even had! We got there around 8:00 and for two we only had about a 20 minute wait. We were seated in a comfortable 2 person booth with a great view of the place. Our server was quick and attentive. She brought waters and we ordered a bottle of Bob's Your Uncle wine..(the reason for the four stars was the wine. It was not very good, and it was a tiny bottle. In their defense it stated on the menu that the bottle was only 5oo milliliters, but I guess it didn't click for me and I was unhappy about the surprise). We started with the fries and a side of sriracha mayo - they were great! They were shoestring fries so Michael and I plowed through them. Michael got the breakfast burrito, and I got the corned beef hash. Ah-mah-gah. The corned beef hash....again the hashbrowns were shoestring like spaghetti in a bowl, and the CB was sizzled like bacon crispy. It was de-effing-licious. Michael devoured his omelet raving about how wonderful it was. We were too full for desert, so we skipped that, but I would go back here in a heartbeat!"
"Definitely my favorite place for lunch on the west side despite the 15 minutes hike plus 20 minutes wait time. Two of us arrived shortly after 12pm. They have a nice lobby with a traditional diner touch. A nice gentleman told us about 20 minutes wait time. Left my cell # then just walk out to see what are place around here. Found a butcher place nearby selling fresh goat meat. Need to stop by later to get something.We received a text msg and went back to be seated outside. It was a pleasant day to be outdoor. I immediately decided on Pork Belly Pancake. My friend opted for the special of the day: Pulled chicken on pita bread. We decided to split the smoked fries as well.We kind of shared both entrees and totally agree on Pork Belly was the excellent choice. Pork was flavorful and not greasy. I have not figured out if the pork was braised, steamed or baked. Anyway it was so tasty with shredded cabbage and crispy noodles. The grilled Scallion pancake was the perfect wrap for those. The very light touch of housin sauce was just right. This should be a perfect oriental dish but I have not seen anything like this at any Asian place I tried. Absolutely delicious. Pulled Chicken with pita was pretty good but not as impressive as the Pork Belly. I liked the diced tomato and arugula on the top.  I was not impressed with smoked fries which I could not really tell the difference from the regular fries. That is pretty much left untouched.Our waitress was lovely and efficient. It was a perfect lunch for us. I will be back really soon."
"Part of the ""Cereal Killers"" section of their menu.  The corned beef hash is tender and moist.  I was on a quick business trip and planned on breakfast here, glad I did!  I would go back just for this."
"Sooooo cute. Little Goat diner was recommended to me by a coworker who has yet to come here. It had a hipster look to it. I had French toast with crispy chicken and BBQ maple syrup. It sounds disgusting when you're reading it. But it is the most satisfying thing I've ever put in my mouth. Ugh, I'm craving it already. Definitely worth coming back."
"You would think awesome food plus Top Chef winner plus West Loop location would be the perfect formula for ego or pretension, but instead it equals perfection.  I love that I can get inventive food and feel comfortable here as a family or with my girlfriends.  I adore their lattes, the sandwiches are superb, breakfast is delcious, service is warm and friendly and I have even spied Ms. Izard cooking in the kitchen.On my last visit a girlfriend and I split the reuben and the los drowned sandwich.  Both were juicy and flavorful and a really large portion.  We didn't need the fries, but we ordered them and they were delcious as well.  On a previous visit I sampled the corned beef hash and dark chocolate chip pancakes and it was a terrific way to start the day.  I'm still spying the sloppy goat and various other sandwiches on the menu.  The key is finding enough people to join me so we can all share!"
Awesome concept for an awesome chef.  Had their version of the Rueben and just loved it!  Topped off my meal with a delicious chocolate malt.  Best diner ever!
"Two words... Over rated. I've been here multiple times, so I've given it a good try.  We always find ourselves struggling to find something on the menus that's good.  Chicken = dryFish = WhatevNachos - really goodOverall just ok.  Not coming back.  Little goat is just ok.  So many good places in Chicago I don't think this is worth your time."
"A friend and I both got the Mushroom burger. Mine had the goat paddy. It was delicious but we both thought it was too salty. It might have been the sauce. We also shared a bowl of fries amongst 5 guys. The regular fries were just that-regular. Nothing special about them. Just thin cut fries to accompany my burger.I also tried a breakfast dish my other friend couldn't finish. I forgot the name but it was chicken with French toast and strawberries. It was a unique breakfast dish apart from the traditional eggs, bacon, hash, etc. It was good but I would not get it myself.The burger was around 13. I paid a total of 18. For the price, I'm not sure I'd go again."
"Why haven't I gone here before!?!Highlights/Notes:Be ready for a wait, but this place is worth the wait. However there is a side cafe where you can chill and grab yourself a coffee or lil morning snack while you wait. I enjoyed a cup of the Little Goat and it was delish! Because I can't handle coffee I got decaf and it was still flavorful (based on what my friend said).The wait took about 25 minutes when they estimated 45 which was great! We sat at the ""bar"" which was aweeeesomeee because as we waited, we got to see all the delicious types of food come out!! I would suggest it for first timers!!I ordered the Bulls Eye French Toast, it came with chopped up fried chicken, but not any kind of fried chicken, they were battered way differently than the fried chicken you get from KFC/Popeyes/churches, and so forth. Straight gourmet!! It was also topped with fresh strawberries and this delicious syrup. Best parttttt... The two french toast came with a surprise!!! Two sunnyside up eggs!!! The dish was so flavorful. A great combination of sweet and savory.I can't wait to eat here again!!My only suggestion is, although I was loving the music, it wasn't fitting for the atmosphere."
"This is my third time here and I have to say, everything here could be twice as expensive at another restaurant, but it would half as good and in half as fun a setting. I love Izard is actively creating an institution(s) that sees itself as the center of food culture in the west loop neighborhood. Basically: neighborhood joint + $10 + a Michelin star deserved."
The Shrimp and Grits = AMAZING!  I just have no words for this menu selection.  I have eaten here several times and each time I am pleased.
Quality and consistency of reviews says it all... This place simply rocks.  Had brunch on a weekday and it was packed to the gills.  Supremely enjoyed sidling up to the bar in lieu of waiting an hour and enjoying a meal with chatty personable waitstaff and patrons alike.  Wanted to try the most ingenuous and odd dishes - and Kimchee thing and Onion brioche French toast with fried chicken delivered.  Just make sure you're ready for a food coma... Or leave yourself some time to walk it off.
"First time here, but my friend told me it's so famous in Chitown. Goat burger juicy, smell so goaty actually:) it's really good thing for me, if you like that smelling too:) Coffee worth doing recommendation too:)  I ordered a latte wiz goat milk, lol yah goat again:) love this place, except need to loudly speaking cuz of the loft design, and our waitress was so weird, can't find her all the time, but when she showed she is very hurry to take plates.....so annoying"
"This is a hip place with great food. The decor was trendy, but classic. There was a mix of people there on the Friday afternoon we visited. I felt a little out of place since we had two little kids with us, but the staff was very friendly and made us feel right at home. I hade the Bullseye French Toast, which appeared to be a play on chicken and waffles. It was delicious. My wife had the Almost Drowned. In all a great sandwich, but very messy with the au jus. They have a kids menu, which pairs well with the diner theme. I washed everything down with a great beer from the drink menu. Overall a great experience and I thought the prices were good considering who owns the place. I hope to go back soon."
My mom sister and I went here for lunch we ordered the cheesy garlic bread for an app it was so yummy and not just basic. Mom had the pulled pork and I had the Los De...something or other sandwich we were both super happy. My sister got the biscuits and gravy she wasn't as pleased thought it was too salty so didn't really eat it. She did get some of the garlic mashed though and loved that. They could definitely consider serving ice water instead or Luke warm water. We visited at about 1 and they were all ready out of two items we had wanted to order so that kinda stunk but all in all we were really happy.
"With apologies to W. Shakespeare:COME away, come away, goat,    In a burger I must sample thee; Fly away, fly away, bloat;    For more gluttony, let me be free. The pork belly pancake, that signature dish,    O prepare it! Tempura mashed potatoes, it is my wish    We share it. Not a wait, not a wait long,    From my goal deters me; With resolve, with resolve strong    For a plate of Kalbi. Your blueberry pie with goat cheese ice cream,    My little diner fair, Finds its way into my happy dream    For me to also enjoy there!"
"Don't hesitate, just come here. You'll be amazed. I came on a weekend afternoon. My oh my, the wait was quite long. They don't take reservation during weekends, so try to come a little earlier. They will get your name and number, and once a table is ready, they'll text you. It's quite ""modern/efficient"" for them to do so. Now, they also have a coffee/bar/snacks/accessory area. It's a really small room connected to the restaurant. Products vary from books to coffee to fresh flowers and wrist band. If you are bored of waiting/standing by the main desk, you can at least wander/look around there. We were seated and the waitress left us scrolling the menu. We ordered: Tiramisu Shake Mushroom Burger Pork Belly Pancake Elvis French toast Los Drowned Sammie Okay, I HIGHLY recommend the Tiramisu Shake. It's reallllly good. I ordered a cup, a friend of mine tried it, and the next thing you know, she ordered one too. It is rich with a great balance of sweetness and creaminess. You may wonder what that scoop of white cream is. I THINK it is a heavily whipped cream but it does taste buttery. So maybe a combination of both whip cream and butter? The mushroom burger was a really great dish as well. Patty was juicy and the bun was crispy. Don't be afraid to hold the burger with both your hands and dig in! As for the Los Drowned sammie, the beef was really juicy as well. It came with this sauce. I highly recommend pouring it to the beef. My friend decided to dip the sammie to the sauce, so it got pretty messy. Next time, if I have a chance to go back(most likely will), I will try the cookie shake. The waitress did recommend it. Also, I kept seeing people order the You might wonder why I am not giving them a 5 star after all my praises. Simple, our waitress. I don't know why but that lady was nowhere to be seen. And when we do see her, she walked by like lightning. How are we suppose to order!?"
"Great spot for Sunday brunch. We had a small wait but nothing to major. Once again we all shared 4 different meals. At the table we had a Cuban sandwich with two sunny side up eggs on top, bullseye French toast, spiced apple pancakes and the parathas burrito. I would recommend each dish to anyone. They were all delicious and unique. Great flavors and they were all presented very nicely. It was crowded when we got there, around 10:30am on a Sunday. Wait was only about 30 min if not less. Well worth the wait!!If u are in the west loop area then u should go and check it out!!"
"This place by far has the most kind, funny, and genuine staff. The food was amazing!! I have been here twice and the potions are pretty big. The wait is the only thing that stinks, but is totally worth the wait. The drinks are fantastic too!! Bloody Mary's are delicious and the prices are totally reasonably! Compliments to the chef/owner/staff/management. Wish I could give the waitress some credit by name. We will see you again."
"We have eaten at G&TG a few times and have always enjoyed it - so decided to give it a shot last Monday AM (9am).  Were seated asap and server was super on her game this day.First we started with bloodies (don't judge us at 9am -  used a vacation day from work - LOL)  and they were freaking amazing!  Had an slight asian flare and perfect on spice and depth. One of the better bloodies I have had in a while. The sig other ordered the crumpets and chorizo and also some eggs.  I opted for biscuits and gravy with bacon.  We both really enjoyed both and passed the plates back and forth.  That is why I love S.I.z restaurants, the bread, biscuits, crumpets = all homemade and ridiculously delicious.  We really enjoyed our breffast - and the place has a nice relaxed vibe.Honestly I rarely give a 5 star rating, however we took some loafs of bread and bagels home from the bakery next door.  Used them for breakfast items, and made mussels and the bread for dipping.  Was really really good.  Thus took the 4 star meal to 5 stars with take home - top notch baked items.Keep up the good work!  We shall return..."
"Breakfast is the best meal of the day, and Little Goat makes a case in point. This is where I take visiting friends and family to start out weekend mornings. Big booth seating, creative-approachable food and friendly service helps begin a Saturday right.  It's dependably good and lives up to its hefty hype. Crowds line up early, so you should plan on putting in some wait time at their attached cafe and go for a short walk around the area - one of Chicago's best restaurant districts.The Brandade and Belly and the Parathas Burrito are a couple of my favorite breakfasts they serve. Their menu is enormous, as any ""diner"" menu should be, and there's a wide range of extra sides, drinks/juices/coffees to quench any appetite. There's lots to choose from and everything so far has been good. Believe the hype. I'm a big fan."
"Love this place! Cool atmosphere and upscale diner fare. For some fun, try the Korean burger and the tempura mashed potatoes. Both are a little bit mind-blowing. Was hoping to try some little items from the bakery next door, but alas, they were sold out. Next time, I guess."
"Bakery? Diner? Not sure how this place is classified. I've never been to a diner like this before, but I guess if you also own a way more upscale version of this restaurant, then I suppose this place will do as diner food.Even for Sunday brunch, I think we lucked out because we didn't have to wait any more than 15 minutes. We even scored our own booth! Nothing against the communal tables, but it's awkward sitting next to your dining partner and if you sit across from them, you're subjected to everyone's conversations. Since I was catching up with a friend, I was really grateful for our table.After very thoroughly going over the menu, I decided on the bull's eye French toast. There are very few meals that I remember/yearn for weeks later, and this is one of them. Eggs inside sweet onion brioche. Crispy, fried bits of chicken, topped off with BBQ maple syrup. I couldn't really taste the BBQ-ness of the syrup, but it didn't didn't taste so sugary, thick and gross that supermarket aisle syrups are. There were even strawberry slices mixed in.The dish was huge, and I savored every bite. The mimosa was nice to wash it down with, but for $7 it wasn't much, especially compared to my friend's giant bloody Mary.The only downfall? The side of fries we shared -- way too salty. You could see the little pool of salt sitting on the bottom of the plate when we were done. Not a fan.We did have great service though. No issue splitting our check, and she even asked whether this was our first time at the restaurant, and periodically came in to check up on us."
"We got here at 11 am on a Saturday and put down our name for four people.  We were told that the wait was an hour and ten minutes if we were okay with cafeteria seating, and an additional ten minutes if we wanted our own booth.  We asked for a booth.  We ended up waiting an hour, and an additional half an hour for our food after we ordered.  Had to run outside and feed the parking meter, because we only put two hours in.The food was pretty good, as many reviewers have said before me.  We've eaten at Girl and the Goat and loved it, and while this was nowhere near as amazing, it was still pretty good.  Big portions for the price.  We had the bulls eye french toast, which was a good mix of flavors and not overly greasy like your typical chicken and waffles.  Also tried an omelette, which was very good as well but nothing too spectacular.All in all, while the food was pretty good, we're not sure if the food was worth the wait.  The bakery is amazing and makes a darn good croissant - light and fluffy and delicious.  You can be in and out of the bakery in ten minutes - seems a lot more worth it than waiting to sit down."
"Huge fan of Stephanie Izard, so we were excited to try this place. We walked in pretty close to closing, which I hate doing, but staff was super accommodating and welcoming and sat us right away. I had some type of cocktail that was like a Moscow Mule - delicious. But the reason I'm writing this review - is the sandwich. Good God. I can't stop thinking about it. Los Drowned. Get it. Love it. Whoa.We also ordered the Bulls Eye French Toast, super decadent and delicious, and the Pork belly Pancake, which we thought was maybe a little too busy but still very tasty.Overall, similar to Girl & the Goat, you can tell people love working here and eating here is like getting a big hug. Just an overall enjoyable experience."
"Diner meets great food.I can't believe how inexpensive the Little Goat is, but don't let that fool you.  The quality of food is great.  What a great mesh of well prepared interesting menu items, in a friendly atmosphere with good prices.  Diner meets great food."
"As good if not better than Girl N The Goat...  The casual environment was fun, service outstanding, loved the menu (mix of traditional diner + foodie). My group had some eclectic eaters and some very picky eaters...we were all thrilled and can't wait to return.  Suggest to make a reservation, although we got lucky and walked right in about 5.30 on a weeknight with no wait. But it filled up immediately after we sat down. Very reasonable pricing too."
"Due to a one-hour wait at Girl and the Goat, we realized it was the perfect time to try out its newish sister restaurant. The service here was fantastic, but I thought my meal was just okay. I'll be returning to try something different.We were initially seated at the counter by the kitchen. It was really hot there, so after a bit we were able to move to a much better seat -- a booth by Randolph St with open windows. It was so romantic with the flowering trees and the light spring breeze!My Paratha Burrito had a lot of interesting flavors and textures going on, but it just seemed kinda bland, which was surprising because everything at Girl and the Goat is max-flavorful, sometimes too flavorful. I was able to get more of the chili sauce which helped. The mac and cheese was really disappointing -- mushy noodles and bland cheese sauce. I admit I have sky-high mac and cheese standards because of Hot Chocolate's version in Bucktown, but still, it seemed like Little Goat could do better.My partner enjoyed his crazy kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes thing, and he also loved his oh god, goat chili. Due to all the cute goat mascots plastered everywhere, that one weirded me out for a little bit. It didn't stop me from stealing a bit of the crunchy topping off his chili which was really tasty, lime-infused or something."
"I went to Little Goat diner over the weekend with my spouse, brother, sister-in-law and niece. We had reservations and seated immediately. We ordered all sorts of breakfast dishes (cant remember the names) and loved everything. The food is unique, beautiful, fresh and delicious. We plan to return again to try more options."
"I had catered lunch by Little Goat and it was one of the worst meals I have had in Chicago. The only words I would use to describe the sandwiches would be ""gooey"" or ""huh?"". Both the beef and the tuna sandwich had toppings equivalent to what I'd imagine a 10 year old would stack on a piece of bread before daring his friend to eat it. The ratio of tuna or beef to ""mystery ingredients"" was easily 1:6. The shrimp sandwich was edible, but still a bizarre concoction."
"Apple pie baby me-oh-my, it's a Willy P kinda day!!!  But wow, let me get ready to tell you about Little Goat's Dinner, a locals-only type place where u can trade in your $$ for grubies and good times.  Well, Big D was in from Scotsdale AZ and he din't look so good so i told him lets eat, thatll get u back on your feet again, and everything will be ok again like it used to be. A littlt bit about Big D is he mistrustful of almost anyone mainly cuz of what happened at the ice skating ring he worked at in Flagstaff AZ where i don't think he's really got over all that. I called up my best friend Toby to see if he wanted to come but he got city regional rollerskater tournament next month so he said he needed to re-tie his ropes and polish his pads so he can finely win one and make it big. So it was settled - me and Big D went alone like the good old days (January 2012 - August 2012), and man it was just like 2012 all over again.We got there and took seats, like hungry and cool kings in a giant food castle where you can eat the walls and rugs and even the chairs and stuff. I did the ordering because Big D's no foodie like me, so I kinda pointed at the menu and raised my eyebrows and tried to smile at the waiter guy till he picked something for us. Well, we got the good times rolling with some of them big poofie puffy potato puppies, which had all my favorite flavors and came out hot and fer-resh as hell! U guys know I'm a real-deal flavor hunter, and let me tell you these had such flavor you will never forget it!  I looked over at Big D so happy with my eyes big as moons but there he sat, a sad Little D, forlorn and broken. He pushed his food around with his fork like babies do and I tried to make that joke that he likes about what did the peach say to the orange but I forgot the ending so it kinda ruined the whole thing and I knew things were coming to an end, that i might not see him again for a while. Overall, Big D's a good guy but just missed out on the fun in life for too long. My only complain is I think he took my stereo and some cassettes 4stars."
"Cool diner with unique food offerings. All the dishes sounded good! Brandade and Belly, Pork Belly Pancakes and Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch were all good.Service was great at first; our server was patient with all our questions, but unfortunately, toward the end of service, she became a little grumpy."
"THIS PLACE IS REAL, essentially food porn. You will definitely leave satisfied and if not, stay at home and eat your cherios. The little goat is tucked away in west loop and is crackin at all times. Suprised that we got to the diner, w/o a reservation, and were seated within 30 minutes. Could have been immediate if we had decided to eat at the bar in the back. Brunch consisted of the following items:Parathas Burrito - Yes, I got this because I'm brown. Even so, it was by far the best item we got topped the a scrambled egg, avacado-bean salad, and a delicious chili pepper sauce. GET THIS!Crispy Fish Tostadas - The fish tostadas were topped with a chickpea onion salad definitely gave them a different, yet fresh taste. Douse these with their house hot sauce before indulging!Cheesy Garlic French Bread -- only mistake we made -- looked much better than it tasted. Def wlll hit up tater town next time (garlic mashed potatoes or the smoked fries)!If you come are coming to Chicago, be sure to get a reservation here in advance -- if you miss this place, YOU WILL REGRET IT!"
"Any kind of goat burger and the goat chili fries are to die for. Sweet and savory meat and SO ridiculously TENDER. Ambiance is great as well. It's an upscale diner that is beautifully decorated. If you're in Chicago, GO THERE. You will not be disappointed."
"I love Little Goat!!! My partner and I go there regularly and have enjoyed everything we have eaten... the fried pickles and onion rings are phenomenal, the burgers rule, the Rueben is amazing, and so the Los Drowned!!! The wait staff is usually on point and very nice as well.  It is also super important to note that this place doesn't even need to exist.  Stephanie Izard could have just kept her life happy and successful with ""Girl and the Goat"", her upscale restaurant across the street.  Instead she decided to make a chill place with seriously delicious food for anyone and everyone to enjoy.  I wish I could give her five stars for being an amazing human!!!The only reason Little Goat gets four stars instead of five is the stupid communal dining table... Why is it so hard to hear the person you are across from? Oh yeah, it's the gigantic amount of space between you two.  Also, no one really wants to sit on top of the stranger next to them... The last time I went it was super loud in there... I would have had to scream across to my partner to have a conversation.Thank you for bringing the awesomeness to our hometown Ms. Izard! Get rid of the communal table and I will give you five stars happily."
"Guess all the hype from the mother store - ""Girl and the Goat"" got to me to try little goat and there is no line to grab a bite here. We got a seat right away and near the kitchen where I like to see the real action that prepares everyone dishes. To my surprise that day I actually saw Stephanie in the kitchen (it was a plus to see the owner/celebrity and actually working in the kitchen). It was hard to pick a item off the extensive menu that was offered, too many items that I wanted to try out - usually for breakfast I go for the pancakes / french toast but what caught my eye was the smoked hash in duck fat, not sure why I picked it maybe because it sounded good. The food came fast and at first glance, looks very appealing but after a few bites, the dish started to accumulate grease and getting heavy to eat, though washing the food down with coffee did not help the cause. What helped me finish the dish was to tilt the entree in a slant to help drain the duck fat. Overall the entire adventure was decent, my bottom-less coffee did hit bottom a few times and food was decent but need to try the pancakes next time - Gave an extra star only because I saw my favorite celebrity chef."
"One word. Amazing..!  We've been here 6 times and they have no food flaws. I'm super picky, this owner has it together . Food is  so consistent it blows me away. Cx out the Spanish omelet,  tuna  melt, Mac cheese- Only negative- wine prices are very insulting and total bottom shelf wines.  But that's Chicago for you, a good bar manager would be able to fix that ASAP."
"We thought our dinner was hit or miss, but we will likely give it another try. We started with the daily bread, which was absolutely delicious. We also got the fried pickles and onion rings, which we were very excited about but they ended up being almost inedible. The pickles were ok but the onion rings were too huge to eat comfortably and some were not cooked enough--I found flour in a couple after the fried part peeled away. I got the bullseye french toast but without the egg--it wasn't great but I blame my choice to remove the egg. My husband's fun and crispy chicken sandwich was pretty good and the smoked fries were amazing."
"First off, let me just start off by saying that this place lives up to the hype. Great rooftop, the coffee and pastry bar in the front was amazing, and the food is worth the wait. I'll just leave a list of tipsDO:-get there early, we came at 10:15 am on a saturday morning for brunch and still had to wait-try the pastry/coffee bar in the front, we got some cookies and brownies to go with an iced coffee and I would come just for that before work if I had time, it's just as good as the food-try the asian pancake, goat's milk oatmeal, and fried chicken french toast, all were amazingDON'T:-order a cocktail expecting to get drunk, or even buzzed, my mother and I ordered the rhubarb gin fizz, which tasted amazing because they created a rhubarb jam for the drink, there was barely any gin in there though-don't be afraid to try some of the weirder menu options, such as the kimchi egg breakfast, some of her stuff sounds a little strange but it all tastes amazing"
"I love the idea of diners and breakfast food all day, but I really love that this diner put a twist on all of their food and drinks.  You have your classic dishes, but you also have some classic dishes with kimchi or another unusual twist.We came during lunch and were seated right away.  Loved the atmosphere, but the service was lacking.  We found ourselves waiving down waiters wherever we could. They weren't coordinating behind the scenes and were bringing out drinks that weren't finished being prepared, which was awkward.  Then when we asked them to bring out valet ticket out, the hostess looked at us like we were nuts.The food was delicious.  We enjoyed the patty melt, the chili fries, crab dip, and the seafood dish.  The crab dip was my favorite, served with traditional ritz --- probably could have a better compliment than ritz.  The seafood dish was mediocre.  The salt was overwhelming and I couldn't eat very much of it.  I wouldn't order it again.  The other two dishes were well prepared and tasty.  I think I would like this place more for breakfast and will try and go back during the breakfast/brunch hours."
My favorite weekend breakfast spot in Chicago.  I'd be fibbing if I said my apartment search when moving here this Spring was not based on proximity to Little Goat :)
"The food here is dubbed diner style food, but it is 100x better than a typical diner. I have been here for both breakfast and dinner and had great experiences. They have a gluten free menu which is a huge bonus for me. Unfortunately it is pretty hard to eat healthy here - plan to splurge. For breakfast I had a latte and the cornbeef hash. The corn beef was seasoned incredibly well and the potatoes were not dry at all and were very flavorful. It was the perfect St Patricks day meal!"
"Chicago favorite! I love the crazy menu Little Goat has to offer. My absolute favorite is the nachos, it usually makes me full before the entree comes (although this does not stop me from eating more). The food is very flavorful, full of surprises, and just a lot of fun to eat. The ambience is very upbeat and playful, I feel comfortable going with friends or a fun date night, nothing too serious. The price range is clearly above any regular diner, but the place really tries to maintain the light, comfortable ambience of a diner and I really appreciate the amazing food that comes along with it. I've definitely never had a dining experience like this place!"
"Finally got to check this off my list, and so happy I could! I went with a group of girlfriends and we were seated promptly when we checked in for our reservation. Our server was very nice and gave great recommendations, after saying everything on the menu was delicious. It was very hard to choose from the variety of options - from breakfast choices, to sandwiches, the blue plate specials.I split the Chickpea salad and the Patty Melt with the beef patty. The Chickpea Salad is a hefty portion of chickpeas, falafal, kale, and other veggies and has a refreshing, light dressing. The tzatziki on the side adds a nice touch.The Patty Melt was like a high-end McDonald's Big Mac. There were onions, tomatos, and a secret sauce that oozed out of the burger and onto your fingers, begging to be licked off. It was one of the best burgers I've had - unassuming, but perfect.I had a bite of a friend's ""Pie of the Day - Passionfruit meringue on a chocolate and white cookie crumble crust""...not exactly sure I described it right. It doesn't matter - it was GOOD. The passionfruit flavor was abundant, but not overwhelming. The meringue was nice and crispy. The crust provided a good balance to the slightly-acidic meringue. Diner food from a celebrated chef - you really can't beat the fantastic taste or the value."
"A few things:Service: pretty great! We were starving and it was about 230 in the afternoon on a Sunday (busy brunch/lunch time) but really wanted to try this place--- we mad a reservation on the way over for 430 hoping that would give us the lead-- we were right! We arrived over an hour early but were seated ASAP, and we overheard them telling another party of 2 it would be a 45 minute wait! So win on that account!Menu: really impressed at all the fun twists on such otherwise basic and classic foods. I had the fat Elvis (with regular maple syrup as I am a vegetarian) with a side of hash browns. And my friend chose a vegetarian party melt with the tempura potatoes on the side. I was overall impressed with my waffles thought the peanut butter butter was PHENOM.. Loved my hash browns EXCEPT--- I found a HAIR in them... Towards the end of eating them I found it, so at that point I felt silly. I was going to tell the server but he came and grabbed the almost empty palate before I could stop to show him--- at that point I felt dumb saying ""oh by the way, the plate you got rid of had a hair"".. In hindsight I probably should have said something. My friend loved her food as well. Had we not been stuffed we may have tried a dessert, maybe next time.Overall great experience but I'm taking away a star for the hair... And the fact I won't be able to order those hash browns again or I'll probably just think about that hair. Ew!"
"If I could eat here every day I would.  I love their tea latte special -- omg -- the first time I had it, I ordered 2.  Everything I've eaten here has been awesome -- biscuits and gravy: off-the-chain/ toast: delicious/ fish tacos: fresh and clean/ home fries: just what the dr ordered. Great space, too -- has an upscale diner vibe and very fun menu -- can't wait to eat more!!"
Went there a couple months ago. My impression was meh. Nothing really stuck out for me here besides the picnic table seating. Sorry but felt it was over rated
"F me, I'm still thinking about the tuna I had here, WTF a tuna melt? Yeah, a tuna melt. Must be what meth addicts feel like...The fries, frites, I would have eaten all of the fries. Then the ones on all the tables around us if it weren't for the person I was eating with.It. was.busy..and we still had great service, and not a long wait time.I can't honestly tell you what my co-worker  had as I was a moment away from making out with my, the best f*cking tuna melt on the d@mn planet... She did thoroughly enjoy hers though, I remember her taking multiple pics of it before she inhaled it.Believe the hype..Come here and try every possible thing you can."
"Good lord where do I begin. Now I know having to put your name in for a table seating can turn people off. However just stop and think maybe because the food is really that good. Well duh!! My first experience today was fantastic. The wait wasn't even that bad only 15 minutes or so. Now my dining buddy is a frequent here and he suggested I order the Tonkatsu sandwich which is a breaded pork cutlet with Asian BBQ, Mayo, Cabbage served on White bread. The fact that the sandwich is plated like a tower all upright and pretty had me feeling like Godzilla ready to devour.I think what impresses me the most is how they keep such long hours. Believe me the instagram photos I already stalked proved the Little Goat has quite the following.Seriously God bless this place for rocking a fabulous product in an industry that is extermely difficult. Til next time :)PS- Beer Cheese soup is not only cool to say but I would use it as a dipping sauce on anything and everything."
"I haven't been to Chef Stephanie Izard's other establishments, but this is good place to go with friends if you're looking for good food, good atmosphere on Randolph street. Little Goat is a bit of an amplified diner with an interesting menu list, but the menu descriptions does not possess an upscale feel. Hm... Kimchee & Asian Style pancakes? Or Sloppy Goat? A couple of the menu items uses Asian-inspired ingredients, but don't feel intimated. Everything on the menu sounds intriguing and inviting. The Goat Chilli Cheese Fries as starters is the bomb! I love how you can order breakfast for dinner. For some reason, breakfast food tastes better at night. There's nothing wrong with ordering Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes at night. It comes with this awesome chocolate malt butter. One of my favorite side items is the Mac and Cheese. Also you have to try the Sloppy Goat at times. It comes with a tangy, sweet sauce. Also the portions are pretty good for what you pay. Little Goat is definitely a place I will come again to try almost everything on the menu. You must go! :)"
"Best place in neat the loop and west side for breakfast.  Opens at 7 making a perfect spot to meet friends before work for very good egg dishes, its own bake shop and , best of all, Stumptown coffee."
"2nd time going there. It's a cute diner, the food is good, a bit on the salty side. Fair prices compared to other city places. Ordered the reuben w kimchi, sloppy goat, fried pickles, and a turtle pie dessert. Also picked up cookies from the bakery. All good, but not fantastic."
"LOVED this place!  The kimchee, eggs, bacon, and pancake I ordered was delicious and not your typical breakfast item.  My friends ordered the Elvis and the Bull's Eye french toast and both were excellent (I had a couple of bites of their meals).  I love that there's a coffee bar adjacent to the main dining area for people who are waiting for their tables.Definitely a must-try when you're in Chicago."
"Standard breakfast and lunch goods.The Kilgus goat All-American burger was very good: thick, moist cut of goat, topped with the works. Very pleased. The coffee was standard diner coffee. The fruit plate was served refreshingly chilled. The atmosphere tends to be busy, but never rushed, in a large, open, square layout. The service is prompt, and reasonable. Plenty of patrons arrive in larger groups... beware the congestion."
"I have been here twice. For both time, the decisions were made by friends. I would never go by myself after the horrible girl and goat experience. The first time was totally a disaster as girl and goat. The second time, it gained some redemption for its thai flavored pasta. Their coffee in the bakery shop was a disaster again. They have great equipment and beans. My husband is a serious coffee drinker and he literally spitted out  after first taste. (He usually doesn't do that to bad coffee for the respect of barista. But this time he said he could not stand it at all). Gosh. Sometimes people like and go to a place just because it is popular and trendy."
"The goat chili cheese fries were out of this world! The yoda juice was an amazing cocktail. I found the chocolate malt pancakes were a little overcooked and needed syrup, but everything else was great. Service was friendly and attentive, but reservations do take a month or more for prime times! The Los Drowned came with a terrific au jus, and the crab dip was flavorful and not overwhelmingly fishy. We'll definitely be back - we didn't get to try the deserts yet!"
"Good food! Super long wait! Pricey dinner food, but delicious! Attached is a photo of the $20 burger my husband had when we were there last. Meanwhile I had the Korean beef burger, which was good."
"I'll pre-disclose that this review is based on Little Goat's private event dinning services on the second floor.When I found out I'd be going to Little Goat for a corporate function, I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.  Being an out-of-towner and only knowing Girl and the Goat, my assumption was that it would be a scaled down version of the Chi-Town hit.All I can say is, w.o.w.  Little Goat has one of the more unique and comprehensive private event set-ups I've been to in a long time.  A completely integrated ""dining room experience"", the second floor is comprised of a home-style kitchen, two massive family style tables and a small bar.  The ambiance is truly incredible (check out their site to see).Relative to food, we had a nine course tasting menu with wine pairings.  All of the offerings we tasted were fantastic, and surprisingly, I found all of them on the current downstairs menu.  Some surprise super-stars of the show included the bread (I guess I should of expected that from a seudo-bakery) and the kohlrabi and butternut squash salad.  Both stole the spotlight from also fantastic ""main"" courses.Service was superb...  I don't think I had to ask for anything during the event outside of stating what pre-dinner drink I wanted.Definitely a once-in-a-lifetime kind of experience that I highly encourage anyone looking into it to try!"
"This place was so adorable! I loved the decor. The service is great too. Our waitress was amazing. As far as the food goes it really lives up to the hype. I had a burger with a fried egg and it was delicious. We also had the Brussel sprouts which I usually dont order but they were so good here. I would say you really need to order them along with the tempura mashed potatoes. I would say pass on the Mac & Cheese it really wasnt all that special. It felt like it was missing something. I also wish they just served regular fries, the only thing close to fries were the smoked fries but I really don't eat pork and they are hickory smoked with ham I believe (as explained by our waitress when I stated I did not want any pork on anything) so I opted out of ordering them. I will be back to visit this place soon :)"
"Very good food, but expect to wait for a table, especially at peak times.  We had hoped for sitting on the rooftop, but it was closed for a private party.  We had fish tostadas (my husband loved the hot sauce they brought out on his request), and I had the Elvis bacon/peanut butter/banana waffles which were also very tasty.  We did sit outside on the street, which I think may have made the service a little slow (especially filling up waters and iced tea on a warm day, but the service was also pretty good."
"Loved it...great flavor combos...( I am an executive Chef) and an unstuffy relaxed atmosphere. If you are looking for pretentious food and service..this is not your place..but if you are relaxed and looking for new experiences in the food realm....well then this is for you.The staff ,while relaxed is super professional, and well educated in the menu...what more could you really want with out being a total prick?"
"I finally got in on a Monday night with less than a 10 minute wait after driving by numerous times on weekends and other times and seeing large clusters of folks hovering around out front.  Well now I know for myself what all the fuss is about. The place and the food are fabulous.  Best, most original, exciting diner/comfort food I've had in recent memory. We tried lots of stuff and all were ""WOW, this is delicious"",  From the grilled cheese, smoked fries, and taco boat desserts, all greatly impressed us , which is not that easy cause we're pretty hard core when it comes to our food.Hip, unpretentious environment has a great buzz and but not too loud that you can't have a great conversation to go with your great food. What really clinched the experience for us though was our server Amy. Sweet, cool, fun, hip engaging and with a lively wit, bright eyes and big melt your heart (and ice cream) smile!  Amy was all the ""cowbell"" we needed to put this place on the top of our list."
"Best meal I had on my short trip to Chicago. The pork belly pancake was not what I expected (I didn't expect an Asian Fusion type dish) but it was SO GOOD. It is a Chinese style scallion (green onion) pancake topped with a large chunk of pork belly and a deliciously dressed bok choy salad over that. I've had better green onion pancakes at Chinese restaurants, but the combination of all the elements made up for that by far. I also got to try some of the BLT omelette special and that too was excellent. I can't wait to come back!"
"Nice casual atmosphere.  Ate at the bar to avoid long wait.  Full menu available, so a great option.  Wait staff was great and food was very good."
Great place for brunch lunch or dinner. Everything I've had here is delicious and they put a creative twist on diner classics. The Bulls Eye French Toast is a must have mix of savory and sweet in the morning!
"Pretty good food but nothing amazing. I had the french toast and my date the quesadilla. It was all just average really, there are better diners in the city. My date tells me the drinks are good though. Will not come back on my own."
"Just discovered that Little Goat has a vegan menu - the selection is limited and you have to ask your server for it special, but the options are delicious! So glad that restaurants are starting to understand that they are missing out sales by excluding vegan eaters.  I'll definitely be back soon Little Goat!"
"I've never been to the Girl and the Goat, but given the fact that it's fully booked for over 3 months, I would expect Stephanie Izard to be quite a competent chef.but that didn't show at Little Goat. I got the highly rated French Toast Chicken per yelp and our waiter's recommendation that ""It will blow your mind"". Well, it was pretty good. The egg was buried inside the french toast which was interesting. The fried chicken came in chopped up slices which was unexpected. Overall, a good dish, but it does not justify the $16 price tag. I felt like I was eating a fancy high quality McDonald's breakfast item. I'd rather go to Publican Quality Meat a block or two down the street.Overall, Little Goat is a good, overpriced diner that serves good, not great and not as inventive as I would've expected, food."
"Amazing food, service and atmosphere. Gets very busy on the weekends so make a reservation."
"Wow! Stephanie Izard has done it again! This diner is about a year old & it is getting rave reviews. It is always packed & people are willing to wait 1+ hour... In the cold! The nice thing is that you can go somewhere else while you wait. They will text you when your table is ready or you can wait at her bakery next door. That is great service!When you enter the diner, you are immediately transformed into a different era. There's a photobooth at the entrance & many get a kick out of it. We ordered the apple strussel pancakes, tempura potatoes & my favorite, the bulls-eye French toast. When you read the description for the French toast, you will think, ""this does not sound appetizing."" oh boy! You are so wrong. The BBQ maple syrup that is poured onto the fried chicken & brioche bread & eggs makes this dish a winner! If I lived in Chicago, I will likely visit this diner every week! I want to try the pork belly pancakes next time."
"There isn't much left to say about this place that people haven't said before. But I will try to mention a dish that isn't getting nearly enough love - the brandade and belly.I'll be honest. I didn't know what brandade was before I had this dish (and I still don't think I know...). I think I even pronounced it wrong when I ordered. But instead of making fun of my uncivilized tongue, my waiter reassured my choice with a ""that's my favorite dish!"" I must say, he has impeccable taste as well.The textures and flavors you find in this dish pretty much cover the spectrum of what the human mouth can handle. The brandade provides a oily, fatty, soft, melty that contrasts the spicy, slightly sweet, crisp kimchi that accompanies the tender, savory pork belly, all served with a runny, well-seasoned egg on top of flaky, warm biscuits.I've been here twice and had 8 different dishes, including many of the favorites: breakfast spaghetti, kimchee and bacon and eggs etc., bull's eye french toast, dark chocolate chip pancakes, and much more but the brandade and belly is hands down the best dish so far. I'll have to try the fat elvis waffles the next time I visit.On a side note, the hash browns are delectable. Crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and just the right amount of cheese. Also, the cauliflower is underrated and delicious, although not as good as the ones at Girl and the Goat."
"Finally made it to Little Goat today and had an outstanding brunch with two of my favorite ladies. We started out with a carafe of their mimosas and they were delicious and had a champagne to OJ ratio that I very much appreciated. For our meals my friends had the tuna melt and the omelet of the day, a crab Rangoon omelet. I had the los drowned sandwich. We also shared the smoked fries and the hash browns. All of the good was outstanding! I literally could not get enough of my sandwich and the crazy good au jus that accompanied it. I also thought the smoked fries were excellent, their flavoring was like nothing else I've ever experienced. My friends also really enjoyed their meals and there were not many complaints!The service was definitely of the caliber I'd expect from a Stephanie Izard restaurant. They quoted us a 30-45 minute wait but it turned out to be less than 20! They also texted us when our table was ready which was so great, definitely something I'd take advantage of during warmer weather. Additionally, our waitress was helpful in answering our questions and very attentive. I also appreciated them bringing our second carafe of mimosas so quickly there wasn't a dry glass! I also have to comment on the ambiance. I loved the crisp, cool decor. It's a very inviting and relaxing place. The enormous booth we were seated in was the perfect place to relax and catch up with friends. All of these things and more make Little Goat a must try!"
"Yum Yum Yum!We thankfully visited Little Goat for brunch early (ish) as it got really crowded as we were leaving.  I had heard mixed reviews, so I wasn't sure if I would like it, but decided I just had to stop in as I've had some great meals at Girl and the Goat.We arrived and were offered the ability to either sit at a communal table or wait 10-15min for a 'real' table.  We elected to wait.  What's nice is that (after figuring out the confusing ordering system), is that you can go into the coffee shop/bakery/bar next door and order a beverage of your liking.  I elected a skim latte which (as other reviews have already stated) came with a heart on top.  That does make the high price tag more palatable, but honestly, I think it's about the same price as a latte at Starbucks and this one was way better.  We ended up waiting about 25 min and got a very pleasant apology for the wait upon being seated.  Now, down to business.  This menu is HUGE and you can get breakfast all day.  I pondered way too much before finally asking our waitress some opinions.  I elected to have the burritto and I was thrilled with my choice.  While it's not a burritto in the traditional sense, it was amazing.  It's naan bread with eggs, kidney beans on top, guac and a bunch of other delicious items.  I honestly wasn't sure what I was going to get, but it was wonderful.  I took half home and I hardly ever bring breakfast leftovers home (by the way - a few seconds in the microwave turned this into an afternoon snack!).  I had a bite of the corned beef with eggs and hash browns.  It was good, but I really enjoyed mine better.  I had some more coffee at the table (cutest cups ever...actually everything is stamped with the little goat thing...maybe too much, I don't know, but the coffee cups are adorable).  All in all, this was a really great spot to have brunch.  I would definitely return and now I just want to come back for dinner as soon as possible.  I'm dropping one star as service was a tad slow (and I think the food may sway from divine to ok...but perhaps a few more visits will change my mind.Food - 4Atmosphere - 5Service - 3 (I had almost finished my meal when my coffee arrived...and we had to ask for refills a few times when the coffee pot was nowhere in sight).Bathrooms - 4Value - 4"
"Went for brunch on Sunday 9/28 - had a great experience! Put in our name for a table, expressing a preference for outdoor seating. While we waited, went to the coffee bar- I had just a regular coffee, but it was excellent! Waited about 30-40 minutes for our table, which was fine (brunch is always so busy), and were seated to our outdoor table! best spot in the house for sure. I ordered the shrimp & grits, which were delicious! roasted pistachios made the dish unique, and it was just the right amount of food. My friend got the banana pancakes, which looked amazing. All in all, would definitely like to go again for dinner!"
So good! Us four gals all devoured our food! The Brussel sprouts are amazing as is the specials they had today! Great servers and fun staff!!!
We recently hosted a baby shower brunch at the Little Goat private dining space. It was a flawless experience from beginning to end. Patrick originally spearheaded our initial contract negotiations and logistics. Brandi helped setup the day of and the menu. The day of the shower all staff members were amazing. They overlooked every single shower detail. The service and food could honestly have not been any better. David was an excellent event host and took such great care of us. I received many phone calls and emails after the event with compliments. What a great experience! I have referred many friends and I would be happy to host another event at Little Goat.
"GET THE SHRIMP SANDWICH from Little Goat bread!!! seriously unrealFor Little Goat Diner:goat chili cheese fries---holy amazing and perfectlos drownded--beef sandwhich with awesome toppingsfried pickle sandwhich-- gave me chills it was so goodburrito-- def good, but the least favorite"
"I kind of expected to hate this place, as the hordes of self-professed foodies who fawn over Stephanie Izard tend to annoy me (I have nothing against Ms. Izard, I just don't care much about celebrity chefs) and I thought it seemed a little too hung up on its own cutesy-ness (e.g. the menu says sammiches instead of sandwiches). Yet, I decided to give it a try because it's in the neighborhood and I had heard some good things.  We showed up around 11:00 AM on a Monday, and it was half empty - apparently the perfect time to be there because I have seen lines stretching down Randolph for this place.  We were initially seated at a small table that was next to a giant table full of young mothers and babies - I asked if we could sit at a booth, and the hostess could not have been nicer as she moved us. It turned out all of the babies were at a communal table, and it was funny to watch all subsequent parties who were seated near the babies request to be moved (the hostess always moved the groups).  The waiter was quite nice and attentive.  I had the omelet of the day - an egg concoction with pulled pork, barbecue sauce, and cream cheese.  I thought it was a moderately risky order, and it turned out to be pretty incredible.  Overall, I'm glad we went to Little Goat, and I'd love to go back again to try something else on the menu."
"I've been to little goat a couple of times - the breakfast foods are great.  The burgers are good, but not life changing like some people I know think.  I actually wasn't that big a of a fan of the goat burger, it was ok, I'd stick to beef personally.That all said, it's the the first restaurant that I'll take out of towners to."
"We went here when we couldn't get into Girl and the Goat and I was not disappointed one bit. Menu has a lot more ""mainstream"" items and they are done right. We got the nachos for an app and we could have been done after that they were so good and filling. Nice outdoor seating too."
"I've had two Little Goat experiences and both were phenomenal. I suppose I should start by stating that I am a vegetarian. So if you are going to judge my opinion based upon that fact, closing this review is what you should do.  My first experience was my favorite. I think the best way experience Little Goat for the first time is to have a few beers and then at 11pm decide Little Goat is what you need. My boyfriend and I did just that. There was zero wait time and we were in and out rather quickly. I ordered the Spanish Omelette and I mean, wow. I had dreams about that omelette for about a week following. It was so incredibly flavorful and delicious. My second experience was almost as good. This time I ordered the Parathas Burrito. I really can't put into words how great it was. My boyfriend thought the same and he loves eating animals. We ended with the Pb&j pie, which a super smart decision. I couldn't believe how they were able to fully capture the flavor of a Pb&j in the pie. I don't know how they did it but they did. All in all, if I could eat at Little Goat maybe once or twice a week I would. But that wouldn't be fair to my body."
"Wonderful! My boyfriend and I went here for brunch on a Friday while vacationing in Chicago and liked it so much, we went back for dinner the next night. We arrived around 11 a.m. on Friday and were seated at the counter right away. Saturday night, we'd made a reservation for 10 p.m., but they were able to accommodate us when we arrived at 9. The hostesses both times we went were so genuinely nice.The first time, I had the pork belly pancake, which was delicious and unique without being overly filling. Wonderfully salty and savory with just a hint of sweetness. Loved the crunch, too. The second time, I had the patty melt with a side of mac and cheese. I'm not usually a huge fan of restaurant mac and cheese, but had noticed the diner next to me at the counter order it the day before, and it looked so good, I had to order it. Absolutely amazing. The patty melt was also fantastic. If I lived in Chicago, I'd be a regular at this place."
"Comfort food, comfortable diner, comfy on the budget.  I like this place.The food is tasty and on the heavier side, it's good comfort food.It is setup like a diner with booths and tables.  It is cute and clean, but not pretentious.  It is a bit loud, but not enough that I was bothered by it.We got the check and were happily surprised that it was really reasonable.  I love that this place is reasonably priced!!  This is a really great example of how good food doesn't need to cost an arm and a leg."
Great food and really nice service! Had a mocha and hard cider to drink. To eat the fried pickles and onions which had an interesting twist along with the nachos. The nachos were amazingggggg
Down scale sister of Girl and the Goat.I strongly recommend it for having brunch. Try to sit outside. You will love this place.
"As part of our destination bachelorette we needed a brunch spot.. Because really who doesn't love brunch after a night of drinking and dancing !Let me just say this place was excellent ! Let's start with the service ! Our server was amazing!!! We were 8 girls and she took wonderful care of us ! All while also taking care of 16 top at the same time! She answered all our questions and recommended that we get the gooey cinnamon buns to start which of course we did! now on to the food and drink ! Spicy bloody Mary's are spicy!!! We were not ready for all that but they were bomb.com !! Cinnamon buns were so delish I was licking my fingers ( no shame ) and we all tried to order different dishes to try as much as we could ! I order a side of bacon wherever I can because it's my favorite thing in the world and this bacon was spot on ! We also tried the porkbelly egg dish , shrimp and grits , burrito , fired chicken and french toast , banana peanut butter waffles , and chocolate pancakes! Everything was scrumptious!! We left brunch with full tummies and great moods ready to take on the cold!"
"Little Goat, Little Goat, what are they feeding you?Is it sweet? Is it savory? Is it tangy? It is unctuous? You boast a little of it all, don't you, you sly 'ol goat?There is certainly no shortage of choices for the masses here at Little Goat. The menu and the space both are vast with much to be seen, taken in, tasted and tried. Feeling a bit like a sensory experience, the Goat empire shows off its maturation here. From the bake shop, to the gift shop, to the coffee shop, to the cocktail bar... the Izard machine struts like a proud gazelle at LG. Don't let the modest diner vibe fool you, I positively i.d.'d the pumping of goat pheromones through the a/c ducts here, just like they do in Vegas. Breathe it in, baby. The rush of all the goatness was not lost on me. I totally purchased rolls from the bake shop and the famous Girl & the Goat green bean sauce (now jarred) in the gifting area while I waited (and waited) for my table to be ready. Just over an hour later, brunch finally commenced... And to mixed reviews. The food was good, not great. Dare I say I liked shopping here better than eating? Fact. I did. Delicious were the ooey gooey cinnabuns, muddled was the parathas burrito. Amazing were the cheesy hash browns, mediocre was the brandade and belly.And on it went... for everything we liked, there was something that felt like it was coming in just slightly under the mark. I almost went three stars with the review until I remembered the pork and toffee crunch milkshake our adorable server said she just ""must have us try!"" It was pure bliss in a glass. Smoky, salty, sweet, rich... I've truly never experienced anything like it. The Izard calling card of unique, distinctive, one-of-a-kind dishes was found in something as simple as a milkshake. Brilliant.Getting your goat through a straw? All the kids are doing it."
"Delicious food with a nice twist on the standard fare.  The nachos were excellent, and so was the mac & cheese.  Nice atmosphere, with options for long booths fitting six of us, communal tables and smaller nooks seating two.  Full view of the chefs in the kitchen make for a setting that feels like a classy diner."
"Really good and elevated diner food!Tried the hot crab dip, fat elvis waffles (topped with pb butter and bacon!), and the onion soup. YUM YUM YUM!Service was really nice and attentive.Plus is that they serve Stumptown Coffee :)"
"Great atmosphere and friendly, helpful service. I had the BBQ Pork Sandwich. Good not great, bread couldn't handle eating like a sandwich and had to knife and fork it. Very good Fried Pickles & Onion Rings. Dessert was the best part. Choco Taco was fantastic."
"On a trip to Chicago I realized I couldn't make it to the Girl and the Goat because I didn't make a reservation 3 months in advance (though if you show up when it opens I've heard you can get bar seating easily) I was excited to find out that it has a sister restaurant across the street in the Little Goat. Also luckily, my girlfriend doesn't like seafood and loves breakfast food, so the Little Goat fit perfectly for our needs. We arrived early on a Saturday morning at a little after 8am and almost got a table immediately. Quickly after we were seated though a line started forming at the door.We sampled a variety of things from the menu, even the non breakfast ones. Such as the Smoke Pork and Toffee Milkshake. For those who think this sounds weird... there isn't actually chunks of pork in it, and the toffee sort of overwhelms the taste and texture of the shake. The smoked pork is more of a subtle thing. It was yummy, though not as unique as I had hoped but definitely packs a lot of toffee.Soon after my Sloppy Goat sandwich arrived and I devoured it. It was big, sloppy, flavourful, and the roll was nice and squishy. I would agree with other reviewers that it is on the salty side. If you don't like salty food you won't love it... If you love sloppy joes you will love it... I loved it.Next my girlfriend's Smoked Corn Beef Hash with Two Eggs arrived. The best part of this dish was the texture of the hash. Loved that the potato was shredded nice and thin, almost like little strings. Coupled with the smoked corn beef, and the fatty yolk... It definitely was a forkful of heaven.And lastly, what I consider the best part of the meal, and perhaps one of the best things I ate on my trip to Chicago was the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup. The maple syrup was infused with the spice and the salt of the chorizo, which elevated something as amazing as maple syrup into something even grander. Having that poured on top of nice fluffy crumpets, and some gooseberries on the side for tartness to balance the sweet maple syrup was out of this world good. It really was the perfect dish. Highly recommended!"
"Little goat is an excellent choice for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Most items on their menu are available all day long. I got the Greek town chicken salad and also tried the chocolate malt shake and tomato apple soup. Everything was extraordinarily good. Make sure you have a reservation on weekends otherwise you might not get a table."
"Bad, Mike, bad... Forgot to write my review (ok... been lazy) until now, but luckily this place is so good I can't forget what I've eaten here (enter sadness now that I don't work by the West Loop anymore.)So I've been here a few times and I loved the korean burger (with goat meat of course), los drowned, goat chili cheese fries, and fat elvis waffles. I've actually had other food items here, but it's just like people and probably your own children... you're bound to have favorites.Service is great as well."
"Not wanting to wait for over 3 hours at Girl and the Goat, we went across the street to Little Goat for dinner instead. We were seated within 10 minutes, ordered and got our food 20 minutes after.Amongst our group, we got an order of fried pickles and onion rings to share, and an entrée each. The fried pickles and onion rings were fried perfectly, with a creamy curry mayo sauce and ranch for dipping.I got their pork belly pancake, and tried the fish tostadas and goat almighty burger. The bok choy salad was sweet and light, and the pork belly was tender and juicy. I only wish they had more pork belly, since it was so good. The scallion pancake that everything rested on tasted a bit weird. It was a bit too thick, so I didn't get the light, puffy consistency that I was expecting. There was also way too much salt in the pancake.The fish tostadas were amazing though! Crispy skin enclosed over some extremely soft and tender meat. The goat burger was also good, but didn't really stand out from any of their other burgers. It basically tasted like a smokier beef burger. I didn't get to try these, but my friends also raved about the All American and Los Drowned. I love this area, and will definitely venture back here at some point down the line."
"I couldn't decide on what I wanted - I like breakfast but I don't really like savory mixed with sweet so I decided on just ordering a simple cheeseburger and fries. The burger wasn't fully cooked and was kind of plain ( not well seasoned). I didn't like the fries - they were like shoestring fries that were cut in half. I HATE shoestring fries so an even shorter version of those is even less enticing. They were well-seasoned but I wasn't impressed.The hot chocolate was delicious but only warm. If I go back, I will try the pancakes or one of the salads."
Totally worth the wait ! Ordered goat chili fries for appetizer and got bull's eye for entrée. Both were great dishes. Also they have house made hot sauces which are amazing and go with everything. Would come back again to try other things on the menu. Service is very good !
"I'm giving a 2 star review b/c I experienced sub-par service, although the food was good.  My friend and I had a lunch reservation.  We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and checked in with the hostess.  She said it would be a few minutes.  Fine. 10 minutes later I went back to check with her, and I said, you know we did have a reservation at 1PM.  Her response was ""well a lot of people have a reservation at that time).  Um, ok.  She didn't even offer or suggest that we go next door to the bakery/bar to get a drink while we were waiting (I had dined at Little Goat before but without a reservation, and the hostess at that time offered up the bakery, so I thought it was rude that this particular hostess did not, especially since we did have a reservation).  Ultimately we were seated literally half an hour past our reservation time, without any sort of apology or acknowledgement.  I understand that sometimes you get jammed up and people stay longer than you might anticipate, but I find it very rude to not acknowledge or apologize for that, as it inconvenienced my friend and I."
"Come with an empty stomach because you will be happily stuffed when you roll out.This is high-end diner food: a trendy mix of French, American, with Asian accents. Their ""sammiches"" are popular, especially the ginormous ""Los Drowned."" I had the Tuna Melt, which was not really a tuna melt but more like tuna and salad slathered on two slices of bread. There was so much tuna and salad that you could barely see the bread, which became soggy. It was delicious though. And my friend enjoyed her Pork Belly Pancake.Food is inventive and flavorful--on the creamy side. You won't be disappointed if you like novelty. For dessert I got the SMOKED PORK AND TOFFEE CRUNCH MILKSHAKE. Yes, you heard right. I kept fishing around trying to find the salty pork bits, which I definitely tasted, but they mix it into the shake very well.Little Goat and Girl and the Goat across the street are opened by the same owner. But apparently this is the cheaper, less fancy, and equally tasty resto. For weekend dinner, come way early-- as in 5pm early-- to reduce your wait time to... under 30 minutes. Yeah, it's that popular."
"Little Goat gets one star just for the cuteness of the name, don't you think?  When I taught Spanish my students would use those online translators and when they put in ""kids"" the translator would give them the Spanish word Cabrito, little or baby goat.  I would read their papers and shake my head but now it makes me laugh.  I also loved that at 10:45 on a Friday afternoon, they had valet service going.  So as I entered, I was happy with the name and  that someone else had taken the car after we had driven around for a while sans parking luck.  The good feelings continued as the friendliness of the staff was jumping off their bodies, every person who worked here was bubbling with nice vibes.  We gave our cell phone number and they said they would text us in about 15 minutes.  I visited the bakery and before I was done paying for some cookies to bring home, our table was ready.We were led to a table for two which I generally hate but it was a bit bigger than they are normally and we were under the fabulous skylight so it just worked.  All around us were working guys who stopped in for a breakfast, Moms with babies and toddlers, couples out for an adventure, oh wait, that was us.  But the good vibe which began with the  staff continued with the diverse clientele.  But a restaurant is all about the food, yes?  And the food was unbelievably good, way better, in my opinion, than The Girl and the Goat.  The menu is varied with too many great options.  I had the Spanish omelet minus the hot pepper and it was the best omelet I have ever had, so delicious that I was thrilled to bring half home for dinner that night.  My husband and I split an order of maple sausage which I probably wouldn't do again.  It was good but not earth shattering as the rest of the meal.  I love tons of beverages in the morning so I had fresh squeezed oj which was divine, a smooth and satisfying vanilla latte and a glass of chocolate goat's milk just because.  I had never had goat's milk before and it was delicious, very light with just a slight slight tang.  YUM!Then we split the blood orange chiffon pie which was subtle and creamy.  It was so big we had trouble finishing it between the two of us.  We were already making plans for our return trip because it was that kind of a restaurant - welcoming, warm, sunny with all kinds of people and food that made you glad you were alive and had taste buds.Next time, I would skip the bakery and just focus on the restaurant.  And there will be a next time.  Soon.  In fact, I wonder if we can fit in a trip today..."
"I've had this place bookmarked ever since reading Brian K's review & his 10/10 rating for the fat Elvis waffles. Finally came here with a friend- 30min wait for 2 on a Friday at 8pm, compared to 3hrs at Girl & Goat. The place was bustling and a bit loud, but it was still a fun, lively experience.fat Elvis waffles ($11) - 5 stars. Unforgettable. Crisp outside with a chew that made me wonder if the batter uses bread flour. I need to get this again.tonkatsu sandwich ($12) - 4.25 stars. Fan of the milk bread and tangy slaw. Delish.Bleinheim gingerale ($4) - 4 stars. Yum, spicy gingerale.cheesecake pie ($8) - 4.25 stars. About the size of a baseball. Ritz cracker crust, topped with thick honey and pears.Friendly, upbeat waitress. Can't wait to eat here again, huhuhu T_T"
"I'm not going to lie....Girl and the Goat was my 1st choice, but since I wasn't willing to give up my first born child a wait 3 months for a reso, I opted for Little Goat....and I was glad I did.I've always been a fan of the whole 'diner' look to a restaurant, so I was excited to see that's what Little Goat looks like.I went for brunch.The staff were quick and attentive. I always had a cup filled with hot yummy coffee.To start, we had an ooey gooey cinnabun - it was soft and sticky and sweet. Heaven.I ordered the omelette special (I think) with what tasted like a salsa and pulled pork. Totally DELICIOUS!My friend had the  Bull's Eye french toast with eggs and fried chicken. Fried chicken and french toast? Really? What genius thought of that?Oh yeah,#Stephanie#Izard, you clever little girl.Please move to Toronto and marry me.Eat at the #littlegoat - you'll be smiling as you walk your fat ass home post meal - I was."
"Little Goat is to diners like Instagram is to an old photo album. This place is hipster paradise, and the 8-top next to us was a lumbersexual group of mostly-bald white guys with jihadi beards out of a GQ shot. We had the bullseye French toast, a Chicago spin on the southern fried chicken and waffles, and it was over the top delicious. Also coupled hot coffee with ice-brewed cherry-heering infused coffee to get the day started with a swift kick, and I can't think of a better diner breakfast experience, ever."
It's good but not great. I would have to be bias in the sense I have had better diner food. Still a good option if the wait at other restaurants is too long... I'd say the food is like a banging a normal girl but your not are going to get a super model .. At least your are getting laid..
"This place is pretty legit! I love the contemporary American-Asian fusion dishes here.Little Goat sports a trendy modern style in decor. It's spacious and the arrangements allow for relatively quick seating. There's an affiliated liquor and coffee bar connected next door as well as bread shop. What's cool about Little Goat is that it satisfies a wide range of meals -- snacks, breakfast, lunch, dinner, and dessert are all deliciously available. Awesome biscuits, mouthwatering sandwiches and burgers, yummy shakes... the variety goes on. I got to try a few things and loved them all: the brandade and belly, the tuna melt, the goat chili cheese fries, and the tiramisu ice cream shake. There's so much to try here... I have to come again."
"Delish. Not for the simple at heart, but it was very good. I had a dish with kimchi and it was the most delicious pork dish ever."
"Had such a great time at this diner! Was expecting a wait, but I was immediately seated as soon as I walked in the door. LOVED their specialty coffees made with goat milk. The fat Elvis waffles got two thumbs up in my book! This place is already on my list of places to visit next time I am in the Windy City!"
"We went here after a race about a month ago. The weather was nice enough to sit on the patio which was great. Our server was also great. I'd describe him as funny and casual with a side of helpful. To start we ordered a round of bloodies which were rather underwhelming. I can't pin point what made them that way, they just were. We also ordered the cinnabun and that was delicious! It made up for the so-so bloody. My friend and I both ordered the burrito and our other friend got the hash. All were great and satisfying. But in the end, for the amount we dropped on this meal I feel like it all should have been more amazing. It almost pains me to say this because I am a HUGE fan of The Girl and the Goat. I guess I will stick to other brunch places and keep Izards original as a top fav dinner spot."
"Wow... seriously wow.After having a pretty good meal at Girl and Goat (most of it anyway), I was excited to see what Stephanie Izzard could do with comfort food instead of the fancy fair.  Let me tell you, I was not disappointed.  Came here with some co-workers for a long lunch, and checked out the following:Biscuits and Gravy:  A standard for breakfast that's done well here.  Quite tasty.  I've had better/softer biscuits in the south, but this is one of the better ones I've had in the Midwest.  Bulls-Eye French Toast:  I think this may be the best French Toast I've ever had.  Seriously.  I don't eat french toast often, but when I do, it's going to be the Bulls-Eye French Toast from here on out... (see what I did there?)Los Drowned:  Tender and flavorful braised beef, lots of complex flavors... not the clear favorite, but I did enjoy the sandwich thoroughly.  A great filling sandwich that's like comfort food on a bun.  Verdict:  Personally, I think it's better than Girl and Goat.  I'm looking forward to bringing the wife here on our next city date!  It's just that good..."
"Everything we had was solid, but not as delicious as I was expecting given the hype and the relatively long wait to get in even though we had a reservation. My bok choy slaw seemed a little bland, and my friend said the same thing about his fish tacos. Does ""diner"" = no zip? Maybe better to stick with with the American comfort food items on the menu than try to dishes with an Asian or Latino slant, but even the scallion pancake under my slaw was a little rubbery. The service was great. Nice atmosphere: lighting, booths, napkins, etc.."
"After hearing a coworker rant about how she's been to Little Goat 4 times now, I was determined to go. Went on a bustling Thursday night around 7 and got a beer at the bar until we were seated in about 15 minutes, not too bad. I liked the reservations system where you are texted when your table is ready. Stephanie Izard = high tech. The vibe is West Loop cool: hip modern diner space, cool music, and cool servers. Overwhelmed by the giant menu/salivating at everything, my friends and I started with the crab dip appetizer with ritz crackers. Very rich and tasty. We also made the right move and asked for hot sauce, which they make in house! Both pretty spicy and flavorful. I ended up with the loco moco hamburger dish since I eyed it at a table next to me, it looked irresistible. The loco moco was: asian inspired fried rice, a handsome beef patty, a fried egg, and some kind of tomato-y asian salsa. I didn't think it was the best thing on the menu, but it was still pretty tasty. I'd love to come back to Little Goat to try more items. I think simply-put, its a high end diner and although high-ish prices, a great vibe and comforting gourmet food."
"Oh how I wanted to love Little Goat! I am a huge Izzard fan and rave about Girl & the Goat. Our group of 4 made reservations for 8:15am on a Sunday morning, and when we entered, the only table available was the community table. Totally fine - except the other people at the table had 3 screaming children (one was running around in circles). Pass. So we waited 15 minutes for a quieter/private table. I hate when you make a reservation and the restaurant basically says ""don't care"" by not reserving a table for you. Strike one Mini Goat. We sat down at the table, and immediately were given cups for coffee - awesome! However, after about 15 minutes without coffee, I walked over to one of the waitresses and asked for some. In a few more minutes, we finally met our waitress who brought us decaf, which no one wanted. Strike two little goat. We ordered the ooey-gooey cinnabun to split and it was amazing. SO soft, gooey, warm and creamy. This was the highlight for the morning. We then waited about 45 minutes for our breakfast without any coffee or water refills and 0 check-ins from our waitress. When we got our food, we enjoyed it. I loved my sourdough pancakes, the bulls eye french toast was on target (pun intended) and the Elvis waffles had great flavor. We asked the waitress to box up our meals and after what seemed like forever more, she gave us our check and boxes. The boxes were each labeled with our meals which was very kind. However, upon getting home to eat the meals, I had been given my friends' food, and vice versa. Stirke three. Our bill for 4 people was $90 and I don't think Little Goat earned any of it. I will gladly go back to Girl & Goat, but will not be recommending Little."
"I don't like being made to feel like I should be honored to eat somewhere.Everything about Little Goat exudes that sense of ""you should appreciate this opportunity.""Snootiness aside, the food is good. I opted for the Goat Patty Melt. The bread was very crunchy, just the way I like it. The goat was a bit overcooked but the sauteed onions and cheese sauce made up for that. Of course, this is yet another restaurant where sides aren't included, an unnecessary ploy to make people spend more just to leave satiated.My brother's Blueberry Pancakes were big and fluffy and didn't even need much syrup.We did wait more than an hour for our food, which is NEVER acceptable in any restaurant. I understand long wait times to get a table but this was off the charts and our waitress didn't even seem to notice."
"Quite simply, the Tuna Melt is one of the best dishes I've ever had in my life! Sourdough toasted and served open faced with flaked tuna, sliced hard boiled egg, a Mornay cheese sauce and topped with a perfect Nicóise salad of Frisée, pickled onion, olives, and blanched green beans. It was a perfect combination of flavors and textures. A steal at $13."
Either I'm a fatass or fried chicken for breakfy is the most heavenly way to start a day.  You have the try the Bulls eye french toast. The perfect salty/sweet/savoryness that got me dancing in my chair.
Great brunch type place located near fulton market. Had the los drowned sandwhich and it was great!! Also had a nice craft beer selection as well. Service was good and the prices were very reasonable. Will definitely return next time im in the area.
"I came here alone as a ""trial run"" for when I come to Chicago with my sister for a proper trip later. I walked from Union Station and it was a very manageable walk (well, in the summertime...). So that started things off on the right foot for me right away.First, I'm in love with the location. It's on this semi cramped street with a bunch of other restaurants and businesses but since I walked that was no big deal to me. The full willowy trees outside and huge windows made it feel like a neighborhood joint, which I always like.I like that the coffee/bar/bakery is right next door because you can just pass through and take a look at the magic in that department right after you're done with your meal.Since I came alone, I got seated immediately at the counter at around 1 pm and I'm glad. I got a chance to see what everyone was ordering and it helped me pick mine! AND I could see the products of those orders... hehehe! I ended up getting the Bulls Eye French Toast which was really very interesting. I wouldn't say it was the best french toast I've had but it was certainly creative and it tasted pretty good. The brioche had an unique flavor which I suppose is due to the ""sweet onion"" part - it was probably the most savory french toast experience that I've ever had. I also don't read carefully, apparently, because nestled in each toast piece was a soft egg! What a glorious surprise! I really liked the eggs in a basket bit of it and they are very generous with the chicken as well.I think I want to try their pancakes next because this was a little more savory than I was expecting, but I'll definitely come back and drag my sister next time!"
"It's sad when the highlight of my time at little goat was the fact that the hostess was kind enough to give me an altoid from her personal stash after we ate. We had reservations, got in and were told there wasn't a table ready.... There was of course 3 tables open. When someone in my party called them out on the fact, we were sat right away.We sat and sat and sat, maybe 10 minutes went by, then I asked the bus boy to let someone know we are here and haven't been greeted. He finished cleaning his table, the told someone. The waiter was scatterbrained, didn't mention the specials until we asked about them, there was no soup because ""the chefs didn't like the way it turned out"". One guy with us was vegetarian, he ordered the quesadilla, but they don't have any salsa or anything. I ordered the goat sloppy joe, with the side of smoked fries, the other person ordered the kalbi ribs.Overall the food was bland, my goat sloppy joe seemed like a manwich but with goat that had been rendered of so much flavor that it could've passed as bison or beef for the flavor. The house-made bun of the sloppy joe was pretty much perfect though. The high point of the food was the fries and quesadilla. The kalbi ribs had no flavor, and were beyond chewy.I won't give it one star, the food was okay, but I feel a lot of the customers and reviews are from jaded people, because chef Izzard won top chef and has run a successful restaurant across the street. The 7 cooks I counted on the line needed to refocus, and whomever is in charge of FOH needs to have their employees focus on the customer, not chatting up each other."
"I love this place! You should always make a reservation because they are always busy and you will have to wait more than 30 minutes without a reservation. I have been here for both lunch and dinner. This last time I went I made a reservation and was unfortunately 15 minutes late due to parking issues (they have valet parking for $12 but I didn't want to pay that much so I searched around and finally found a spot for $4 for 2 hours on the street). They won't seat you until your entire party is there even with a reservation. Unfortunately the person I was meeting was also late and the hostess had to give away our table. Luckily for us there was another one available right after so we did not have to wait. My friend and I both ordered hot tea. It took a while to come out and when it did the tea bags had already been sitting in the tea cups for quite a while and the tea was severely over-steeped (i.e. it tasted bitter and was not good). My friend had to send her water glass back because there was a lip stain on it and she hadn't even drank out of it yet...so as far as drinks go Little Goat did not do well. I ordered the cinnamon roll...fabulous as always (and took half of it home for later). I also ordered a spanish omelette which was delicious. It had pickled peppers, cheese, sour cream, and some sort of salsa which was fabulous! I would definitely recommend it for vegetarians or omelette lovers! If you ever go for lunch or dinner their fried chicken is delicious especially the fried chicken sandwich (it has a different name but I forget what it is called). Little Goat has American food with an interesting and different spin."
"Mmm...comfort diner-style food with an Asian twist! Many of the combinations seem odd, but they work. After an hour wait, our party of three was seated at the counter. It was cool to see the chefs at work, but man did it make us salivate! I had the pork belly pancake, which is under sandwiches, but it's open-faced. That didn't bother me though because it was amazing! The flavors went really well together and it wasn't too greasy. The special of the day was a salad topped with fried pig snout. It was tempting, but I needed that pork belly!I also tried the goat chili cheese fries, which was offered by the drunk diners next to me. So glad I didn't order that because I'd lick the plate clean! I don't remember what beer I had, but it was a craft beer that was on special for four bucks. It was good though! My dining companions are foodies from Seattle and loved their meals and drinks, so I was happy. One word of caution: the bathrooms are hidden, and by hidden I mean the wallpaper on the entrance door matches the walls, so it blends in. That's not fun to try and find after two beers....."
"This place gets pretty busy at lunch, you might want to come in around 11 and you might be able to get a table.  LG does not take reservations, we were able to slide into 2 seats at the counter at 1145am.While viewing the menu, I was deciding between a couple of sandwiches.  A female patron sitting next to me recommended the Los Drowned sandwich which I eventually ordered.FANTASTIC!  This braised beef sandwich with avocado, butterkase cheese with peppers, onions, spicy mayo on a hoagie was outstanding!!!!!Definitiely going to come back here to tackle breakfast which I heard had humongous portions!Update- I've been back 3 times and every time keeps getting better and better.  The Patty Melt is the absolute BEST Patty Melt that I've ever had!  The meat here is AMAZING!!!!  I've had the FAT CLUB (Bacon, Turkey, Ham, Guacamole, Cheese), Patty Melt and the All American since my first visit and have not been disappointed!Take a look at some of the pics I've attached, you will start drooling!"
"Yup, the trifecta: beautiful place to eat, wonderful service, and amazing food. I heard about Little Goat from the chef at our cooking class and was eager to try it. I asked the waiter for help deciding, because I saw too many good things to easily pick one. It's a modern menu, so there's stuff you won't get elsewhere and the kind of decor that makes you want to redo your living room. A lot of people very much respect the chef. I had a milkshake and a hash of some kind (it's been a year so I'm surprised I remember even that, sorry). About those, all I can say is: yum."
"Food was great, annoying wait and no good place to stand.  Being bumped and pushed by busboys not so much fun."
"Loved the setup of the place, as they have a bar and bakery in the back as an additional waiting area. Decor had antique elements but with a modern twist. Service was good.Had the Breakfast Spaghetti 'N Clams 'N Crab. It came out to be soupy, which was unexpected. It was pretty much like a spaghetti omelette in a little broth. Very unique but quite odd and somewhat tasty? I didn't taste or see much of the crab, just more of the clams. Favorite part was the strips of bok choy. It was nice that it wasn't a heavy dish.Boyfriend had the Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes (the Bull's Eye French Toast ran out) and for me not having a sweet tooth, this was very nice. Not too sweet at all but much chocolate flavor. The texture of the pancakes overall really did it for me. The crunch definitely was there as they seemed to have used cocoa nibs and something like ""rice krispies."" The pancakes itself were very light in tasting.Their coffee was splendid, having a rich smooth taste.Wouldn't mind coming back and trying some other unique dishes, especially as they have very good portions. However, definitely don't feel the need to, as food seems quite overrated."
"I am fan of Stephanie Izzard, when I dine at Little Goat, I always leave feeling as if something was off. Not meaning then food was bad, but it could have been better."
"Little Goat DinerI finally made it to Stephanie Izard's second restaurant and I was so excited despite the weather being ridiculously gloomy. As soon as we were seated, the lady next to us was talking about how delicious her white fish tostadas were, so I decided to order that! The fish tostadas included crisp whitefish, with a shallot aioli, a chickpea and onion salad and that was all topped with harissa vinaigrette. I also ordered a side of tempura mashed potatoes which is mashed potatoes that is tempura fried and then served with asian bbq and ranch sauce. The tostadas were delicious although I am just not a huge fan of chickpeas. The aioli really added a lot of flavor to the dish and the tostada shell and fish were fried to perfect. The tempura mashed potatoes were also really good, although I enjoyed them more the day afterwards since I was so full from the tostadas. One of the other pictures is of their machos nachos, which were nachos topped with bbq pork, beans, pickled peppers, cheddar, sour cream and avocado. The pickled peppers were key to this because the tangy flavor really meshed well with the sweetness of the pork."
"We checked out the casual partner restaurant to A Girl and the Goat, and absolutely loved it. (I can only speak for the breakfast here, but that's my favorite meal of the day anyways, so I can be pretty discerning about what a good breakfast is.) I had the omelet of the day, which had fresh corn sautéed with cream cheese, peppers, onions, and topped with a semisweet tomato jam. I also had a side of bacon, which was probably one of the top 5 sides of bacon I've ever had. And I've had a lot of bacon in my life. I also had a taste of the Bullseye French Toast, which was OK, although I'm not a huge fan of soggy French Toast and it's pretty gooey on the inside. Their coffee was great, not typical diner coffee at all, and their bloody mary was fantastic as well (no crazy garnishes but perfect spices)."
"Went for dinner at this place and the moment we stepped in everything was so great. The hostess, the waitress everyone were full of energy. Coming to the eating part - they have some really good apps and I really liked their Crab Dip, the crackers were really fresh and the dip was also delicious! We also ordered the goat chili and I can say that it was the best goat chili I ever had. I ordered the goat almighty and it was just out of this world. The meat was nice cooked and juicy, I could taste the flavors and not to forget the burger was really huge!! It was my first time visiting this diner and my overall experience was really great. Definitely making few more trips to this place."
"Kimchi cream cheese bagel on everything bagel. Try it.  Seriously.Was in Chicago for a business trip and my best friend suggested that we try this place out.  I haven't really followed Top Chef closely, but figured why not?  Man, how happy was I to have gone!First off, the place is SO ADORABLE.  I love the decor and their concept of a trendy diner.  The waitstaff was incredibly friendly and helpful and though we had to wait a while for a table, we didn't mind.  We got there at 10:00am and there was already a 45 minute wait!  We went to the quick shop attached to it where we had said Kimchi cream cheese bagel and I could have been happy if we left it at that.Of course we didn't and had a nice brunch with chili goat cheese fries and their pork belly.  Yum, yum. And YUM.I left there fully satisfied and would absolutely recommend this to anyone who is visiting Chicago!"
"3.5I was unimpressed with Little Goat.The service was lackluster on a Friday brunch/lunch time.  Coffee empty several timesNo offering of condiments with coffee, obviously our server doesnt drink coffee or know how to serve itWater glasses emptyWaited on silverwareWaited on serverThe food was average.  I just felt like a super greasy spoon actually.  Maybe dinner would be better...???"
"Holy smokes, this place is popular already. I thought I was going to be sneaky and come in after 1 on a weekday for a late lunch - that it wouldn't be packed. Boy, was I wrong. There was a WAIT. I couldn't believe it. Then again, let's be real. Stephanie is the o.g. - original goat. Her name commands serious respect.The little goat drink is fabulous. Smart decision in naming that concoction because if that's the drink that showcases your diner in one order, it really succeeds. It takes your standard caramel latte and elevates it to a whole new tier of elegance that the word ""diner"" certainly doesn't. I could write a whole song and dance to the little goat drink, but I won't. Just know that if you were to walk in and order ONE thing, that ought to be it. Yes, even if you don't like coffee. An apple cheddar soup of the day was well seasoned and went great with the delicious shrimp salad with asian flavors. The little goat drink eclipsed all of that though.One tiny tiny gripe: urrr, I love me some Chef Izard and I love me some goat. However, this place does a real number on your wallet. Yes yes, I know, you get what you pay for, but I thought this was supposed to be more accessible than girl and the goat? Looks like demand is going to keep that from happening."
"I'm half mad at this place JUST for taking years off my life from the utter stress of deciding on what to order from their delicious menu. But that just wouldn't be fair. Decor? You've heard about it. But can we talk about service? There was a little blip from the get-go with our large group reservation. But you wouldn't know it, since the staff kicked it into 3rd gear making our table happen out of thin air. And I had just enough time to grab a quick drink--perfect. Then the menu happened. Whaaaat?! You mean I can't order one of each thing? I can't have breakfast, lunch AND dinner? (Well technically you can, but I dare you to eat a fraction of it all... the portions are HUGE!) What I'm trying to say is that every.single.thing. looked delicious. And when you're an out-of-towner, trying a very famous and fabulous Chicago restaurant for the first time, you want to make the best decision! So, so stressful. Luckily my colleagues felt the same, since I'm pretty much sure we ordered every small plate/app. Here are my faves: - Crab dip. I'm going to need therapy after this damn deliciousness- Shrimp Cocktail: Loving their unique take on this + perfectly cooked, FRESH shrimp- Nachos. We're getting married. - Mac'n cheese--dudes. GET THIS. So then, after the longest, most painful decision process ever, we ordered dinner. Not that we were still hungry or anything...  My colleague got this massive burger with mushrooms and homemade cheese sauce. I think that speaks for itself, but hot damn. So good. I got myself the Boo Boo Baise, minus the mussels. Drooling now just thinking about it. Get a bloody mary. The End."
Reservation:  We were driving into Chicago and didn't want to wait so made the reservation right on Yelp.  Made it to 8:15 and we got there probably 8:17 and we were seated within minutes.Parking:  Parking sucks. Took some time going up and down the nearby streets so find some street parking. It was $7 for like an hour and 45 minutes.  10 pm is the latest the street parking will allow.Food:  Food was EXCELLENT.  Tried 3 dishes between the two of us. Los Drowned - the braised beef sandwich was awesome. Beef very tender. Peppers and onions added great texture and dipping sauce was right on point.  The Bull's Eye French Toast was out of this world. Egg baked into the middle of the french toast. Sauce was not too sweet but also a bit fruity/acidic at the same time. Loved the crispy chicken on top - cooked to perfection.  The pork belly pancake was also very good though I think the other two were better for my taste. Not that the pancake wasn't good. It was great but the other two for me offered more.Service: Our waitress was excellent. Gave us recommendation to try the french toast which we loved. Super busy but checked on us regularly. What I'd expect from a hip super popular establishment as such as this. No complains here.Value: Expect to spend around $16 per dish here. We got 3 things but post-tax pre-tip check was $47 and change. I thought it was very reasonable for a place like this. We had to push ourselves to finish 3 dishes so a dish each plus a side would probably be a more typical portion and price point which is right around $25/person range.Nothing to complain about and I can't compare to other competition nearby as I don't live in Chicago so this gets a 5 star.
"My sister and I made it our mission to try Little Goat for brunch.  First of all, who doesn't like the cute little goat spinning on top of the building?  Don't let me catch you saying no.  It's adorable!  Second, I am not lying when I tell you this place gets packed.  My sister and I waited about 45 mins to an hour for a table.  Don't fret people, just leave your number and they will text you when your table is ready.  Go ahead, wait next door and have a cup of coffee.Finally when we got seated (had to share a larger table because it was that busy), we were greeted by our waitress and given menus.  She also took the time to tell us some of her favorite dishes on the menu.  That was extremely helpful because Little Goat offers an array of different entrees which can be a little overwhelming.  My sister ordered the fish tostadas (fried whitefish, shallot aioli, chickpea, and onion salad) and I ordered the chicken cordon bleu (breaded chicken, ham, sour kraut, pickled peppers, and cheese sauce on a potato bun.)  We also got an order of goat chili cheese fries to share.  Both my sister and I enjoyed everything we ordered.  Everything was very flavorful and all the different ingredients meshed really well with each other.  I never pinged myself to like goat meat, but the goat chili cheese fries were scrumptious.  All the hype about this place is legit.  You get delicious large portion food with a decent price and impeccable service.  Definitely a must try if you haven't already.  There were many more entrees my sister and I wanted to try, but with those three entrees our tummies were screaming ""no more please!!""  We are going to return soon to try out some breakfast items."
"A more casual and bright atmosphere with fun food for any time of day.  Although we went for dinner and enjoyed it, I'd probably recommend coming mainly for brunch/lunch.  The menu consists of lots of standard breakfast dishes, that all come with a twist.  Chocolate pancakes with crispies.  French toast and friend chicken.  And definitely, some asian flavors through in.  They have a good set of cocktails (I got the Hoopoe's Hope) and full bar menu, so it did help make the restaurant seem more appropriate for dinner as well.Overall, we all enjoyed our food and appreciated the fact that it was more casual, as we were dining as a group and with a small child.  We didn't have reservations and came right as they opened.  And though it very quickly got busy, there were still open tables.  So, definitely don't hesitate to give Little Goat a try on a whim!"
"If you've been to Girl & The Goat then you'll understand that the Little Goat is far from the quality of its predecessor. This restaurant is a diner that is held just right across the G&G and it serves up American diner from noon to night. My personal opinion is that this diner was open just to nestle some of the customers that couldn't wait to be seated at the G&G. (I can understand that the wait for G&G can take sometimes days for a reservation... but shit, it's worth the anticipation)Don't expect the extravagance or the similar ingredients in the menu that made G&G ever-so popular. The LG serves up sandwiches, home-style southern diner food, and everything that you would expect from an American road diner. It's bland but still better than most diners out there.If you're looking for a nearby diner that has the umph that you're looking for... then Au Cheval is that good stuff. Au Cheval has what the G&G has and what Little Goat is missing as a diner."
"Since I've only been to Little Goat one time, it may be a bit premature to declare this place as my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  But since everything that I ate is now my favorite food in the world, I guess it pretty much qualifies.So what did I eat?  Macho nacho, dark chocolate chip pancakes, parathas burrito, and goat cheese ice cream.  I want to try everything on their menu but I'm not sure how I'll be able to resist ordering the same dishes every time I go back."
"Pretty baaaah-d ass! This Little Goat's got a huge menu, large portions, and fair prices. It's a completely different concept than across the street, but still world-class cuisine for its category. I tried the macho nachos, crab dip, and the Boo Boo Baise which is a medley of mussels, whitefish, shrimp, and mashed potatoes. Everything was expectedly up to snuff and with some pretty stellar service it was altogether an excellent evening. They've got a full bar and bottles of wine for about $40, so for date night it's indeed more affordable than it's older sister. I'll definitely be back many times over and especially cause I can get their breakfast menu at dinner-time. And now for no great reason other than a similar sounding name and my partiality for male nudity here's that Gotye song youtube.com/watch?v=8UVN…"
This review is solely for the bakery bar. My fiancé and I wanted to try out a great dessert spot. We loved the atmosphere. Definitely a hipster spot. We loved everything about it. An old fashion soda pop diner meets modern times. The drinks were great and had a fabulous selection. The dessert was fantastic. Music was great. It was extremely crowded however the bar tenders were fabulous keeping everyone with full glasses and happy! Service was spectacular and all bar tenders were very friendly and helpful. We will definitely be back continually. Great spot in our neighborhood.
Best brunch I ever been to!! The Tomato Apple soup and Bloody Mary's are the best I have ever had! Great service and menu has so many different options!!! I will defiantly be coming here more often!
"Spectacular food. I didn't really want to rate Little Goat five stars because of the prices I paid and the terrible choice to make sides as a la carte options, but in hindsight the place really is that good. I tried a goat burger, pork in goat broth, tempura mashed potatoes, and the choco taco sunday. There was also some drink from the bar that was one of the best I've ever had in my life, but i don't remember the name, but I'll just say the drink menu is advisably good. The goat burger was juicy, close to medium done, and the bread was rich and nice. My only compaint is the sizeable amount of fried onions. Really, it was an unnecessary onslaught of them, but not so much that the burger wasn't damn enjoyable.The pork tenderloin cooked in goat broth was a special and not a menu item but it was probably the best soup/stew I've had at a restaurant. Very, very strong broth made from goat meat, and the pork and vegetables took on that flavor as well as inputted their natural flavors into the dish as well. Very well done.The tempura mashed potatoes are bad. It's just a croquette of potato basically, and mine came out to oily to the point that i had to eat around the crunchy exterior. The server saw that I didn't enjoy the side item and took it completely off our bill so I won't deduct points for the misconceived potato tempura idea.All in all, great bar drinks and food."
"It's time I reviewed Little Goat since I've eaten there on three different occasions and keep bringing people with me to try it! I love this place with the diner feel and the New American fare, it weds yesteryear with nouveau in a tasteful array of menu choices. Each visit I've tried something different and keep enjoying each offering. The bullseye french toast is a complex of flavors and textures that I wondered if I'd like and was pleasantly pleased by it. The barbecue maple syrup was a perfect compliment to the chicken pieces and french toast. The root vegetables side dish is wonderful so I've ordered it each time I've visited. Most recently I enjoyed the ramen wrapped shrimp cocktail and couldn't finish it due to the size of the shrimp! So filling and what fantastic flavors! The place has an energy about it and it is family friendly. I love the hustle and bustle and the sunroof adds to the lightness and spaciousness of the environs. I will gladly return again and again!"
"Okay, so I haven't had an actual meal here so my review is for the bar. That caveat aside, Little Goat is AWESOME. My girlfriend and I were in the West Loop for a crowdfund gathering at a space run by 1871, and when we left it was still early-ish and we wanted to get a drink somewhere. She suggested Little Goat. What a treat!First, I don't drink anything with alcohol in it. Our server (last name Tucker) concocted the most amazing virgin drink I've ever had. We did try the crab meat dip as well (with Ritz Crackers) and it was incredibly delicious (hint- they don't give you enough crackers with the dip, but again, Ms. Tucker didn't skip a beat as she slid a small bowl of extra crackers in front of us).The place has a great vibe, the music is fun (a little loud but it's the bar so what the heck), the crowd is about what you'd expect on the first really nice Saturday evening in the West Loop. Honestly, I'm sure the food is superb but we'll probably be back for the bar. I highly recommend this place!"
"Hubby and I stopped in here around 11am on a Friday, and managed to snag the last two seats together at the counter.  The ambiance is young and hip with lots of energy.  The food we ordered was sublime.  I had the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes, aka the Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing.  Hubby had the Bull's Eye French Toast, with a side of the home fries.  There were so many layers of flavor going on, complex but delicious and with a clear purpose.  For sure, it's the best breakfast food I've ever eaten in my life, and it ranks right up the with the best meals I've ever had as well.Our server was friendly and attentive, and we really liked being able to see the bustle in the kitchen.  Hilariously, one of the coolers had a neatly printed label on it that read PLEASE DO NOT PUT SH*T ON TOP OF THIS COOLER, which was made even more amusing by the fact that there were three commercial-sized boxes of plastic wrap on top of it.Highly, highly recommended if you're in the West Loop area of Chicago.  You won't be disappointed."
"My friends and I visited the The Little Goat Diner after a night of exploring Chicago. It was pretty late and we wanted a late ""snack"".  We sat at the bar and shared The Macho Nachos, The Goat Almighty Burger and Chicken and French Toast. They all were amazing. My favorite was the Chicken and French toast. I prefer chicken & waffles but this was good to try. Just add hot sauce. The Pulled pork in the Nachos was killer! The bar staff was super friendly and laid back."
"So awesome. The crab dipping sauce with bread was unreal. I don't remember what it was called, but truly awesome. The Sloppy Goat is to die for. Absolutely loved it. I wish I hadn't been a good person and shared it with the table. I've gotta go back now."
"Get there early for brunch: end scene.9am = 30 min wait, unless there are only two of you and you can squeeze in at the counter, with a bonus view of the master her self, Ms. Stephanie Izard, hard at work!Trendy and warm wall coverings surround a huge skylight in the middle making the diner feel warm even on an overcast January day.The Food:- Started with the Cinnamon roll for $3, was not as soft as I prefer but the cream cheese icing was good! - Parathas Burrito - Indian flatbread . sunny side eggs . avocado-bean salad . chili pepper sauce. Not your normal breakfast burrito, more reminiscent of a salad with kidney beans, frise and a tart sauce mimicking a vinaigrette. Delicious!- Bullseye French Toast - Thick cut toast with two sunny side up eggs served bird in the nest style topped with breaded chicken and syrup. It was on the sweet side but full of flavor, definitely would get it again!Though I was disappointed that all sides are ala carte, we both took half our entree's home so we didn't even need them, no small plates here!They weren't serving lunch for some reason, but Stephanie Izard is a master at flavors so I will be back to check that out as well! I've literally seen her use Swedish Fish in a savory dish that blew my mind!"
"This review is for Breakfast only... and it's one of the best breakfast meals ever!By order of deliciousness:1. Fried chicken + french toast (surprise egg cooked inside the french toast... and the chicken was probably the best fried chicken I've ever had)2. Breakfast Spaghetti 'N Clams eggs, parmesan, guanciale, bok choy (nice and light)3. Brandade & Belly 'Benedict' brandade, pork belly, eggs, biscuit, kimchi (wished it had more pork belly)We also had the tempura mashed potatoes which was a nice touch.The atmosphere is great. There's a community table you can sit at and eat if you don't want to wait for a private table (which we did). Our server was awesome. You can keep the cute magnets that came with your bill!They open at 7am, so if you don't want to wait, I suggest getting here before 9am on a Sunday. They get packed very easily."
"The food here pretty much stinks. The flavors don't work, and there seems to be superfluous junk added to every dish, (you know, ""crispy onions,"" ""secret sauce,"" and that). It's for people who actually like Chili's but are trying to be cool.Burgers are only cooked well done, and biscuits and gravy taste like they're made with pan drippings from chicken marsala. Did I mention the flavors don't work?If you want slightly classed-up, well-executed diner food in that area, go to Windy City Cafe at Milwaukee/Chicago/Ogden."
"Think of your happy thoughts. Like the kind that work with Tinker Bell's fairy dust and make you fly. Those... They're few and far between but magical. The Little Goat breakfast experience is one of our happy thoughts.Stepahnie... you don't know me, but I love you. You're like Wendy. But instead of telling me stories you feed me food. Everything about my brunch experience this morning was wonderful. Loads of natural light flooded in through the huge windows at the front and side of restaurant and collided with that from the skylight above. The space has an aura of cleanliness, comfort, and bubbling effervescence.We arrived around 9:00 AM this Sunday morning and were seated immediately in a booth. I could see Stephanie in the kitchen from where I sat; however, some folks chose to sit along the bar where they had an even better view of the kitchen. Even though there was a good bustle of patrons there (and lots of small children), the noise level was happy but not at all distracting.Our server Melissa was SOOOO sweet, helpful, and shy. We liked her. She was dressed like all of the other female servers in cute royal purple dresses with black aprons. There were a LOT of employees: servers, bus people, and hosts. I think some of the employees were managers or investors or something. After all, today is only their third day of being open!We ordered coffee, two Bloody Mary's, biscuits and gravy (both large and small), scrambled eggs, sausage, and grits (totaling $63 before tip). The coffee was really good and tasted like Intelligentsia but wasn't. The Bloody Mary's were okay but we've definitely had better ones. I thought the sausage was the most amazing thing there - it tasted like bacon and I LOVE bacon. M and I both gobbled down the grits. We liked the biscuits and gravy (the biscuits were sweet and the gravy was savory) but we probably wouldn't get it again. My sister didn't say anything about her eggs.There was a short wait for a table by the time we paid our bill (about 10:00 AM). We were satiated and ready to concede our table to the next guests. After all, we wanted to check out the bakery/gift shop area! There was a small café bar, bakery, and gift shop adjoined to the restaurant. We saw jams, spice rubs, shirts, and mugs. We bought two travel mugs ($10 each) and some maple syrup ($25).We definitely want to go again just so that we can try more menu items. We're eager to fly to Neverland."
"I came here for lunch a couple of weeks ago with the boy. It's a very bright and airy atmosphere. Better than your typical diner, especially with the skylight in the middle of the room!The boy and I ordered-Breakfast spaghetti - Definite miss. Some parts were still hard, some were soggy. It was an interesting concept, but it was a let down compared to the rest of the meal.-Sloppy joe - He loved it. -Boo boo baise (bouillabaisse) - I liked this a lot because of the quality of seafood that came with the mashed potatoes. I don't like mashed potatoes, but because the broth was tasty and the seafood was perfectly cooked, it all worked well together. I'm kind of tempted to make my own now!Service was good and friendly. ONE thing to note is that if you go to the bathrooms (whether it's guy or girl), be prepared to get jizzed on by their soap dispenser. I thought it was just me being clumsy and awkward, but when I walked out of the bathroom, the boy had a stain on his shirt from the bathroom soap as well. It's kind of funny. Not a cute ""twinsies"" moment. LITTLE GOAT, please get a less powered soap dispenser! It makes coming out of the bathroom awkward!"
"Recommendations:1. French Toast. I forgot the actual title of it. It's a thick slice of brioche bread with a whole egg fried on it; kinda like an egg in a basket. It's topped with strawberries, slices of fried chicken and drizzle of maple syrup. 2. Shrimp & grits.The girl and the goat latte is like... liquified goat cheese flavored with sweet coffee. Personally not my favorite coffee drink, but it's worth trying. I commend their creativity."
"My experience this time somewhat dropped off from my last visit. It started at the hostess station when it came to our seating request. Apparently trying to get a group of 5 to sit together at a table instead of a booth is a monumental request and will result in a snotty attitude from the hostess.  I brought my parents here for an early mothers day brunch on a Saturday, so they could experience the goodness and creativity the menu offers. For some reason, the hostess thought it would be a good idea to sit my wife, child and parents and I around a man and his kid sitting next to each other while they eat breakfast. The seating arrangement would have had 2 of us sitting across from these total strangers and facing them, for the duration of our/their meal, while the rest of us sat next to these total strangers....Not really the ideal seating arrangement when taking your parents out to breakfast and catching up. I've experienced communal seating and dining on numerous occasions, but have never been sat at a table that would have resulted in my party essentially encompassing another.More attitude and 20 minutes later, a more preferable seating arrangement was available and we finally got to experience some of the delicious food here, kind of. The snail like pace from the hostess stand to get seated carried over to the waitstaff. After being seated for about 10 minutes the waiter announced his presence and said he would be back. Another 5 minutes later he came by for the drink orders, and ran off before we could try to throw in our food order as well, because 15  minutes with a menu is all the time a normal person requires. In the end the food saved the day and made it worth the visit. The bulls-eye french toast is an example of the creativity here, and I highly recommend it. In the future, an execution of common sense on the part of the hostesses could avoid frustration from customers and add to their overall experience. I felt like the waiter's level of service did not meet the high dollar tip he receives as a result of the prices here. Even at 18% he still makes off with a robbery, but I felt bad leaving less. As I said in my previous review, the food is good but the high prices prevent me from coming here as much as I would like."
"I went there with a friend. I had a reservation so the wait is not too long, around 5 minutes to get a private booth. We ordered Los Drowned, All American Burger, and a fried chicken salad. Those are tasting good. The bread of burger and sandwich is awesome. I am also amazed with the juicy steak in my burger. My friend is satisfied with the Los Drowned. Our server is nice and patient, willing to accommodate our allergy concern. Everyone seems happy here. I like the atmosphere, the only concern is that you need to speak loud here, or you cannot hear what your friend talked. I think it will be my favorite restaurant which serves American food.  Will definitely come back to try others."
"Lunch/dinner have consistently disappointed - the Los drowned, fish tostadas, and kimchi burger did not live up to expectations. They were just blah. The Los drowned was too fatty and somewhat hard to eat as the sandwich is full but you'll want to dip it into the accompanying sauce. The fish tostadas were too salty for my taste. Kimchi burger was underwhelming. The mashed potatoes tempura were the best thing I tried. I'd recommend those. I need to come to try their breakfast options, which I've heard are better."
"As the Yelp stars say, Meh. I have experienced better. I was very excited to go here after hearing so many rave reviews from friends. I went with my mom on a Tuesday at 5pm. Definitely no need for a reservation. We were seated at a booth and it looked promising. The music was kinda...eh...like rap-hip-hop-esque that killed the whole mood. Then the terror from behind us began. This little child (I like to call him the beast), maybe 2/3 years old kept looking around the booth at my mom and I, sticking his tongue out at us. Thankfully it stopped for the most part during our meal. My mom ordered a glass of the house red wine and it came in a regular cylinder glass...not your standard wine glass. Um...okay..? The wine was just OK. We ordered our food, my mom the drunken sandwhich and me the sourdough pancakes. Everything is a'la carte and it's PRICEY. $11 for 3 pancakes? $6 for a side of bacon? Yikes. Our waitress was slightly unattentive since I had another waitor grab another drink for me. The food is...good. It's OK, nothing special really. For the price I would much rather go somewhere else along Randolph. Then the family behind us with ""the beast"" started up again and would even stand on the seat, turn towards us, and LOOKS at us. And his parents did nothing. Not to mention there were about 3 other families of screaming children at the Diner as well. This is what I hate about this area, former Lincoln Park singles who create monsters for children who think they're entitled to everything and anything. Definitely disappointed at the whole experience. I think if the menu was updated, more ""inclusive"" offerings, and a better staff, it may be a better place. However, I definitely will not be back any time soon."
"I always try to stay away from 1 and 5-star ratings, but Little Goat deserves the praise.Came for dinner and decided to splurge ($19) for the Goat Almighty burger. What arrived was a 10"" work of meaty art. I've never tried goat before, and I was impressed with the flavors from the goat patty. The beef and pork were incredibly tender and really meshed well together. The onion ring and pickled jalapenos were so good I wanted a side of them along with them on my burger! Easily one of the best burgers I've ever tired in my life, highly recommended."
"Great brunch!! Would definitely eat here again everything on menu looked great. Got special BLT Omelette and it was perfect not a speck of brown on the eggs. Also had the bulls eye French toast and tempura mashed potatoes... Yum! Perfect brunch nice dining space. Service was slow. Food was slow but awesome once we got it. Maybe it was just a very busy day, but we got first item right away then waited 20 minutes for the rest. Also waited a long time for check. In the end not terrible but not great if you have somewhere to go definitely need to leave 2 hrs for brunch time."
"Since Girl & The Goat is BY FAR my favorite restaurant in Chicago, I think my expectations were way too high.. and because of that I was slightly disappointed. I may also have been unlucky because I didn't really like the dish that I ordered, while I liked my friend's dish.After looking through the menu, I couldn't decide between the Fat Elvis Waffles & the Bull's Eye French Toast... but I asked my waiter (who was SUPER nice and friendly!) which he preferred (French Toast) so I decided to go with that. Looking back I totally wish I'd ordered the Waffles! The French Toast (yelp.com/biz_photos/litt…) tried to do the sweet & savory mix (which I usually LOVE) but something was just off about the taste - It was overpoweringly sweet. The first bite was good... then I just started to feel sick with how much maple syrup was drenched all over. I wish I could've taken a bite of the sweet french toast, and then taken a bite of the savory chicken, but everything on the plate just tasted like one flavor - the syrup.Besides that, my friend ordered the Blueberry Pie with Goat Cheese Gelato (yelp.com/biz_photos/litt…), which I liked. It tasted very fresh and I loved the pie crust (well, I actually just love pie crust in general!) - the goat cheese gelato was delicious and pleasantly lighter than I expected.While I didn't like my dish THIS time, I think Little Goat deserves another chance though, so I'll definitely come back to try other dishes (I have my eyes set on the Pork Belly Pancake and Fat Elvis Waffles!) I hope I'll have a 5 star experience!"
"At the risk of blowing my cover, this is now my favorite power breakfast place in the city.  Ok, so my office is in the west loop not far from here and I like to make sure there isn't a suit in sight for my power breakfasts.  But every client I've had here has raved, so the proof is in the pudding.Two things on this menu are particularly yummy and I highly recommend - Pork Belly Pancake and Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing.  So I am not a sweet breakfast guy and I love heat and asian flavors.  Both of these really hit the spot.  The Kimchee thing is like a very eggy, crepey kind of pancake with kimchee and bacony goodness woven into it.  Go ahead, try it, you know you want it (even if it sounds a little weird, get over it).  The Pork Belly Pancake is really awesome and not even on the breakfast menu, but order it anyway (you gotta live a little dangerously).  Scallion pancake with a slab of yummy pork belly and a huge mound of cool, crunchy asian slaw.  It's warm and cool at the same time, with salty, spicy, crunchy goodness on top.  This thing is really inspired.Plus as an extra bonus, you can get a seat right away an 8am in the West Loop because the hipsters are still asleep."
"We enjoyed a great, leisurely Sunday afternoon brunch here today.  Loved the decor, service was great, food was uniformly delicious and so generously portioned that 3 of us took half home for lunch!  All 4 of us enjoyed our meals - goat burger, pork belly pancake, BBQ pork sandwich and fat club. We somehow managed to eat dessert too. The choco taco sundae daughter ordered was an interesting combination of sour cream icecream, hard shell chocolate and chocolate covered ""taco shells"". We also enjoyed the chocolate turtle tart with cashews and the pumpkin tart with pecans. Overall a great meal - the only quibble was the cost of drinks - $9 for mimosas and beers is a bit steep. i might skip the drinks next time and pop into hay market across the street instead."
"Go here.  Quickly.  And go again after that.  I ate at the counter, being given the option to sit there or at the communal table in the center of the diner.  They were busy so I get trying to keep solo diners together.  I enjoyed getting to know my right-hand diner, who was also a first-time visitor to Little Goat.I'm STILL dreaming about my food.  I visited Little Goat after reading the rave reviews, and I'm happy to add my own.  The menu is massive, and I had a hard time just picking one thing.  I settled on the Bull's Eye French Toast and was glad I did.  Fried chicken bites on top of the french toast which had a dippy egg in the middle, all smothered in bbq maple syrup and strawberries.  Soooo sooooo good.My one complaint - I got a glass of iced tea and it was 3 bucks.  No thanks, Chicago, I'll stick to water next time.I didn't have a chance to walk around the surrounding area, but there looks like there is a lot to do right there.  I can't wait to go back and do just that, and enjoy the rooftop dining at Little Goat."
"I was a little hesitant coming here, being a ""diner"" and all. I was so wrong. You can get breakfast, lunch, dinner all day. When I was looking over the menu there are so many options with such different variety it was impossible for me to choose. I asked the waiter to choose for me... (this was two separate trips)Goat chili cheese fries --  a great starter with a group Pork Bell Pancake -- Ah ma zing. To die for. I couldn't get enough of it. The sweetness and saltiness is the perfect ratio. Los Drowned sandwich --  Such a unique sandwich. The pickles peppers and havarti really add such zing to the sandwich. Tip -- if you are really keen on getting the Pork Belly Pancake, call ahead. I've gone before and they have run out of it."
"This place is great. They were very accomodating for our 2 yr old and 4 month old and the ambiance is noisy enough to where I knew my kids wouldn't ruin anyone else's dinner.The food was to DIE for!!! Tempura mashed potatoes?? really!??!! they tasted amazing and the tonkatsu (breaded cutlet sandwich) came in a really healthy portion and was awesome.It's a tad bit pricey but its in restaurant row and I feel they justify it with food, ambiance and service."
"Too much fuss about this place... Come on.It IS A-OK place.  If any server had crossed me wrong at this place it would be a one star review.. but staff was ubber friendly.  Food was okayish... blah. I don't understand why people are crazy about it.We came here because my husband got a gift card from work.  We were super excited to try this place.  I ordered some sort of clam-noodle-egg scramble and my husband order some sort of meat with arugula.  Food was so unimportant that I don't even remember exactly what it was. I don't feel like coming back, don't feel like eating their food.That's it."
One more time I went to Little Goat and discovered there was a rooftop. Great place to wait for your table. Nice cocktails and great bartenders. That's for the rooftop. For the dinner great service and nice food. Outdoor seating. They have a variety of dishes from sandwiches to salads to supper menu. Not a full restaurant menu but it's little goat. If you want a real full dinner you should just cross the street and go to Girl & the Goat
"FIFTH!! WOO!Wow.  Honestly, my life has changed!!! HALLELUJAH! This place is so great, It is like a quick girl and the goat. One of the best things at girl and the goat is the Bread! i mean come onnnnn! their concoctions are so interesting and paired so well. This place SPECIALIZES in bread. I mean they got samples all over, friendly staff, beautiful design, and it's only HALF done. anyway, on the to good stuff// Shrimp sandwich - wow, soo good. the bread is so soft and on the inside and crunchy on the outside. the shrimp is not fried which i like, and the avocado is so fresh. The salad seasoning is very similar to one of the dishes at G&G [i think the pig face salad is the same, with the crunchy little bits]// Swirl roll - just like a hostess excepted hand rolled! the inside, I think, is a strawberry flavor. Yum. Stephanie recommended it herself.// Goat milk latte - goat milk latteeeee with caramel drizzled on top. On the heavier side but WORTH it. at least to me. // Peanut butter cookie sandwich - yum yum yum. i think its like a PB cookie with homemade PB spread! oh yeahI look forward to going back. I meet Stephanie, one of the owners James, and the bartender Anthony. All EXTREMELY friendly people. its not wonder they all work so well together :-) I can't wait to try some of their cream cheese spreads."
"Oh, Little Goat. I live close, so I've eaten here probably 10 times with a variety of friends and family. I am a fan. I like the vibe and the cute goat graphics and the big booths and the coffee and the vegetarian options. I love the parathas burrito, the chap chae, and the salted caramel milkshake. I don't eat meat, but I love how much my friends like the nachos.Amongst my foodier friends, I hear a lot of ""it's really overrated."" At first I assumed they were just being snobby, but having gone back a number of times with a variety of people and I am starting to think the menu is, for one reason or another, a little hit or miss.For what it's worth, I do I think the popularity (of both goat restaurants) is a factor. I think some people go in with very high expectations and then are disappointed. And then there are the people who are extra critical of anything with hype. I'm really tired of hearing ""It's not as good as Girl and the Goat."" No kidding. It's also a totally different type of restaurant and isn't as expensive/hard to get a reservation. People complain too much.Overall, the food is fun and interesting and often very good. The atmosphere is nice and I think they handle their volume well. I have never had bad service (which is something I think people complain about too much). I realize the mix of elements doesn't work for everyone, but I think it works for a lot of people. Totally worth checking out."
"My family of 4 dined at Little Goat while we waited for the next train to leave Union Station. We were not starving and didnt feel like spending a lot for a quick bite. So we said lets try a Diner Little Goat. Wow our bill was $126 for 3 sandwiches. Nacho's and a waffle, sides of brussels sprouts and 2 milk shakes--only think good was the waffle and nacho's that were excellent-service was very good.I am a Milk Shake fan and I was not impressed at all.Wont go again-"
"I've been to Little Goat twice now, the most recent experience being yesterday (New Year's Day) for brunch. Both times I was blown away by the quality of the food and the creativity of the menu. The first time I went, I had the Bull's Eye French Toast. Prime example of why I appreciate this place: its' french toast with an egg cooked right into the toast, with fried chicken and strawberries on top to compliment. You won't find this dish anywhere else. On my last trip, I had the Fat Elvis waffles, which consisted of waffles with bananas, peanut butter butter (you read that correctly), bacon, and syrup. It was the absolute perfect way to rejuvenate after NYE. Both items were outstanding.Having the bread/coffee shop as an attachment is a huge benefit for this spot. We got there during a relatively busy time, so we were able to stop in the coffee shop for an americano and hang out until our table was ready. Once we sat, we were helped right away and our server was great. It was really a top notch experience from start to finish. Great food, great service, easy on the wallet. Excellent experience overall."
"Good coffee,friendly service. A little loud, like the previous Red Light. VG breakfast spaghetti and reuben(with Kim chi). French fries just OK. We were seated quickly at2:30 pm on a Thursday.  Fun lunch."
"First I want to start of by saying I love-love Stephanie from Top Chef and was very impressed with her restaurant Girl and a Goat but this new diner experience at the little goat was very disappointing!The decor and ambiance was fantastic however our silverware was dirty and the food was lacking the robust flavor I anticipated having eaten at her other restaurant. I completely get its  a lot more ""wallet friendly"" but they have no excuse for lack of flavor and for a diner our bill was still over $80 bucks!! My braised beef sandwich was bland and my sister's Mac cheese was generic... Kraft made a better box version it was just horrible. I'm a big foodie and don't mind paying a lot of money for food but this was by far very unexpected from  a Top Chef.  We should've gone to UrbanBelly like I wanted instead..."
This was the best thing I've ever had!!! Dustin was our waiter he proved excellent suggestions and expedient service. The sandwiches were two of the best I've ever had and I consider myself a tough critic
"Ok, if you go to a place called Little Goat DINER and you complain about it being diner food, that's on you!I thought this place was great! The portions were quite large, we ended up taking half out meal home! Dude ordered a bull's eye french toast, which is like a twist on chicken and waffles, and what a twist! The runny egg is in the center of the bread, and everything is sweet and syrupy and then the fried chicken is crispy and flavorful, i was super jealous! I ordered chili fries, crab dip, and a caesar salad. Their chili was good, crab dip was good, and the salad was the most unique caesar salad i've ever had. Most places just put romaine, parmesan, crouton, and dressing. Little Goat diner adds their own flair, including breaded anchovies, it's totally worth it. Best part: they serve stumptown iced coffee! YES!"
"Huge diner. Huge menu. All fantastic for what it is - glorified diner food. Sit on the rooftop (minimal seating) if possible.This place is awesome. It's capitalizing on a hot restaurant trend, the ""hipster"" diner. It offers your typical diner fare, but with twists like a kimchi breakfast platter and an Indian burrito. The menu will have something to please everyone, so no worries.I've been twice in the past week, most recently on a Thursday afternoon. Despite showing up at 2PM on a Thursday, the wait was still 30 minutes. They'll text you when your table is ready, and with the bar/cafe next door, the wait feels like nothing.I ordered the Chickpea salad for the second time. This is a helluva salad - not just a few greens with some chicken thrown in. There are chickpeas, mini falafels, a kimchi dressing, tzatziki, chicken, and kale. It's fantastic, and healthy. My friend had the fat club sandwich. Equally tasty, though slightly less healthy. Come here for brunch, or lunch. You'll leave very happy. If the wait is long, you're also nearby many of the top Chicago restaurants. You can't lose."
"Been here twice now.   My thoughts are....Sandwiches:-The shrimp is the way to go for a first timer in my opinion.  Good amount of shrimp, fresh vegetables, great bread and perfect balance of each-The egg salad was good also but if you don't like pimentos, you might want to try something else.   A little messy because of the generous amount of egg salad.-The beef is nice but I prefer beef sandwiches warm or hot.  I will say the kimchee in the sandwich was surprisingly good. Breads:-Baguette was nice and a bargain at $3-Chocolate conchas were just ok.  They were much different from conchas I've had from panaderias around town.  The chocolate filling was rich but I didn't feel it was worth the money. -Tortone is a favorite and I got a warm loaf that was excellent.  Soup-Goat chili is very good; thick and meaty.  I loved the thinly sliced, pickled peppers and the small, crunchy ""bulbs""( I have to work on my vocab) that came on the side and added great texture.-Apple tomato soup -  I didn't detect any apple or any addition sweetness.  There was nothing that particularly stood out.  It's too bad they don't have some sort of grilled cheese and tomato soup option. I'm sure Stephanie Izard could do a great version. Pastries-Swiss Roll was ok.  -Peanut butter cookie had a good peanut flavor and not too sweet, which I preferIf you are eating in and there aren't any seats at the bar, you can let the cashiers know you want to eat upstairs.  That space is where they'll be holding cooking classes and they have a good amount of tables and chairs.  I don't know if this will always be open but it is open to the public for the time being."
"I finally got to try Little Goat! Yay! I made reservations to ensure we had a table without having to wait like everyone else *cough suckers cough*.  Our waitress was very friendly and helpful with the menu since it was my friend's and my first time here.  I couldn't decide between the breakfast menu and the sammiches since who doesn't love breakfast foods for dinner?  I ended up ordering the Los Drowned and my friend had the Sloppy Goat.  I really liked my sammich and would order it again even though it's nothing exotic.  Los Drowned had braised beef with Havarti, avocado, pickled peppers and onions, and spicy mayo (wasn't spicy fyi) on a hoagie.  The braised beef was so tender and juicy it just melted in your mouth, and the pickled peppers and onions added a nice crisp contrast that was refreshing.  I probably should have known from the name ""Los Drowned"" that the sandwich would be messy but it didn't click in my head..whoops.  Both sandwiches are super messy so if you're planning on having a first date here, make sure your date doesn't scare easily or order something you can eat with a fork and knife (it may also be that I'm not a proper lady and can't eat without getting messy...which most likely is the case).  We also split a side of the smoked fries which were awesome!  The pieces were really small, kind of like odds and ends which was disappointing but the flavor itself was great.  They tasted like BBQ chips but in the form of fries.  After dinner, we went upstairs to check out their rooftop since I read about it in one of those billion Chicago blog articles about the ""best rooftop bars in the city"".  It was decent but definitely didn't wow me.  The bartender was courteous enough but not that friendly towards us.  It's also pretty dark up there and I wish they had a little more lighting so you could see who you were talking to.  Overall, it's a nice rooftop bar but I think I'll be checking others out first.  Little Goat lived up to its name and I will be back!"
"Little Goat deserves almost all of the hype and the long wait times needed in order to get a table. Came here at around 2:30 on a Sunday with my girlfriend and was met with a 45 minute long wait. This place was the only restaurant on hubbard that seemed open and it was buzzing!We waited in the adjacent coffee extension next door and loved the fact that I could see what was going inside the bakery/kitchen through the window. My girlfriend and I are fiends for intelligensia coffee so we enjoyed ourselves at the bar sipping on coffee. We wanted something savory but apparently by 2:30 they were all out of salty stuff at the bakery.When seated we decided to order the goat chili cheese fries. The fries were pretty salty and the texture was eh- too crunchy and lacking substance. I definitely expected more. However the goat chili cheese on top was delicious! It was chunky, hearty, and had some pretty unique spices. I could see why it was 8 dollars a bowl.I had the Los Drowned which was delicious! It was meaty and came with a rich broth. Some chips to accompany it would have been recommended. My girlfriend had the parathas burrito. Parathas shells are so addictive and it encased an egg cheese mixture that was delicious. I thought the salad on top might ruin the flavor but they were all great. Then I decided to follow it all up with some tempura mashed potatoes which tasted exactly like tempura mashed potatoes should taste. It was a unique dish and the crispness of the tempura was a welcome addition to the meal.Unique modern decor with comfortable seating. Our server was very friendly and pleasant! I'll be sure to come back"
"Came here on a Sunday and there was maybe a 20-minute wait. The food is very good and not too expensive. The portions are ginormous, so be prepared to take home leftovers! I had a Korean pancake dish that was really flavorful, and we also ordered a chickpea salad and a goat burger that were divine. The food is a bit on the heavier side so I don't know if I would come here every day, but it was solid.The only negative was the service. Our waitress hardly ever came by and also spilled water all over our table!"
"Been here a few times, had the sloppy joe - great, club sandwich - great. Upstairs event space is gorgeous. One visit I never got my drink but its not stopping me from coming back and I have never had a sub-par meal. Staff is friendly and mostly attentive, from the hostess to the servers and the valet."
"Amazing casual dinning in the heart of restaurant row!Excellent, elevated diner food. Casual atmosphere. Great value vs quality.Buy yourself a hefty Little Goat coffee mug to take home!"
"Frickin awesome! I had the Bullseye... brioche french toast with an egg cooked inside topped with crispy fried chicken bites strawberries & maple syrup! i know!! it was good for me too....gimme a minute & ill go for round 2 lol.If you can, make reservations. There was a 45 minute wait but we passed the time in the bar area snacking on cookies and lattes. Love this space.  Chef, you were great on Top Chef & im still on cloud 9!  Now stop reading and start eating!"
"Value for $.Bull's Eye French Toast -- a combination of Texas french toast, chicken and waffle.  The unique taste left me confused especially from the bbq maple syrup.  I did appreciate the touch of yellow berries.  I appreciated the left over better when my palate appreciated and acclimated to flavor combination.The Little Goat Coffee -- made from goat's milk.  There is a specific taste.  Better consumed warm.  If cold, don't hesitate to get it re-heated.Chili Cheese Fries -- slightly sweet.  The proportion of goat chili, cheese to fries is perfect.  Portion easily serves 2.  Leftover is a notch down from fresh preparation but it is still great to consume.Apple Pie -- $8 may be steep for a single mini-pie, but it's priceless when you have an even, all-around crunch pie crusts to every bite.Bottomless Coffee -- boo hoo!  Beans comes from New York.  Blend is light.SERVICE -- everyone works as a team, coffee is constantly freshen up, knowledgeable and eager.LITTLE GOAT BREAD:  Gluten Free Parmesan Rolls -- one roll has 4 slices.  When steamed (to soften), you can smell the corn flour ingredient.  Better toasted with topping.Pineapple Crunch Gluten Free Muffin -- great for breakfast.  Lightly sweet from pineapple.  Similar taste to pineapple upside down cake.Apple Cider Cake -- what can I say....another delicious breakfast.I will continue to keep visiting until I have tasted everything on the menu."
"We are from out of town and this made our list of places to try. I loved the food here and would definitely come back. I had the chickpea salad with grilled chicken (it was awesome - oversized salad with crunchy kale, cool and creamy tzatziki dressing, and several delicious falafel arranged around the bowl). For some reason the grilled chicken was the best I'd had in a long time - not sure what they did to make it is so good but they did. I tried a taste of my daughter's crumpets (Delish!); I'm a bread lover and this can make any bread lover happy.  I tried the smoked fries - just ok - nothing special to me? I couldn't figure out the ""smoked"" part. They came highly recommended by the waiter but they were just shoestring style french fries. But the accompanying sauces with the fries were very interesting - I preferred the thicker, hotter orange-colored sauce. We also had a side/appetizer of the not chinese broccoli. It was very tasty. Serving sizes here are extremely generous. Wait times were crazy for a Tuesday night at 7pm - but worth it! Our service was less than stellar this night, but it appeared to be our waiter and a one-off situation."
"Went for dinner on a Monday night and the place was packed!  Nice outdoor seating for the summer as well as an updated diner feel on the inside.  This place is in fact a diner serving diner food (in case you thought it was just Girl and the Goat but smaller).  It's an updated diner menu with ""new"" american classics including pork belly pancakes and kale salads in addition to an updated look at traditional classics such as burgers, milkshakes, and sandwiches.  While we came for dinner, I think it would be more aptly suited for lunch or breakfast (or for people who like to eat breakfast for dinner).  Great quality in the execution of each dish such that I thought what I ate was better than I expected from the menu.  Also of note, they have a gluten-free menu for those that need it."
"Among the best brunches I've ever had. Their bullseye French toast is a tastefully combined assortment of a few things I love: Toad in the hole and chicken & waffles. The addition of strawberries balances out the salt from the chicken and maple syrup absorbs all the flavors once the yolk is cracked into. The pork fat and toffee crumble shake is a very interesting milkshake that brought baconny flavor into my dessert - a little different, but worth a try. Great service and a nice ambience made this a great place to bring my sister for her birthday. Coming back for sure."
"Visited last night around 9:30 for dinner. Atmosphere in the front: Diner. Atmosphere in the back, bar, w/ dimmer lighting etc. I was with another friend and we got a seat at the bar in the back and ordered drinks and food pretty much immediately with no problem whatsoever. I got the chick pea salad with kale, carrots, cabbage, celery, colby cheese, and ranch dressing (I didn't use that.) They also gave you 4 little chick pea ""hush puppies"" is what I would call them (deep fried.) It rocked. I really like the different mix of cruncy veggies. My friend got the reuben and from the looks of it he really liked it. I got the Mickey Blue eyes drink which was literally blue. This is one of the first cocktails I have ordered (off a cocktail menu) in a long time that I did not think was way too sweet. It is vodka, and I want to say St Germain? Anyway, it was the perfect mix of tart and sweet. Service was fast and friendly at the bar. We had 3 friends come later and join us. One girl got the quesadilla and they looked amazing, more like ""loaded quesadillas"" they were served almost like nachos. Overall, I loved this place and will be back for sure."
"Good portions, tasty food all around.  Fat Elvis syrup is very smoky and not needed with the waffles and peanut butter butter.Large cups of coffee guarantee you don't go dry when the place is hopping.  Very loud ambiance though."
"I've been here twice - breakfast and post dinner. The food is exquisite and creative! If you go, please order the most eccentric dish on the menu. You will be surprised how much you love it!"
"I highly recommend the Bulls Eye French Toast during brunch. I was starving on a Saturday morning and obviously not everywhere is open in the west loop, but this one was! The waitress recommend this to me and it turned out to be the most creative French Toast I have ever had: imagine crispy fried chicken bites on top of soft maple-soaked french toast! I can't wait to going there a second time."
Everything I have eaten here has been AMAZING!  I have not been disappointed with anything.  It's a family friendly place that has great food.  The thing I like is the twist on food.  I enjoy eating at places where I order something I cannot make at home.  This is definitely the place!  I love Little Goat. It is one of our favorite places in the West Loop.
"This has quickly become one of my favorite places! I'm always wanting to go back and try more, but here are some things we have tried here:The Shrimp - $10 a pop, so it's not something I'd buy everyday but it's so good that you'd at least have to try it! It's definitely my favorite sandwich here. Lots of different textures and flavors, plus they fill it up with shrimp, so it justifies the high price tag.Crab dip with Ritz crackers - a little pricey, but so amazing! Definitely worth it.Sloppy Goat - It was my first time trying goat's meat and I was so pleasantly surprised! The flavors were amazing and the bread was probably one of the best I've tried.Pork Belly Pancake - good, worth trying, but not memorable.The Korean Burger - this was my least favorite. The Kimchi was very salty and made the burger itself salty overall. The Little Goat coffee - if you like Goat's milk, you will like this. If you don't, then it just tastes like coffee with the aftertaste of Goat, which was not my preference.I love the Goat theme of this place and the setting is like an upscale diner, very fun! Great for date night or to try with a small group of friends, but they're always busy so I wouldn't recommend going here with a big group as they currently don't take reservations."
"Little goat bread (and coffee).  This morning wonderful and flavorful lemon chocolate scone..... Was not sure about the flavor combinations, but I trusted Stephanie!  It was awesome!  Worth the wait while the counter staff finished their conversation.The ""new girl"" barista (her label for herself while apologizing for not having things set up a ready) was super nice! And made a great coffee drink.The cinnabun was extraordinary!Sat outside on a lovely 54 degree morning watching the early (630am) goings on in this bustling neighborhood!"
"I feel odd giving a review for a place I did not end up eating at, but it should be mentioned. Also, because I didn't eat there is why I'm tempering what might otherwise be a one star review.We stopped by before a Saturday night Blackhawks game, and before valeting the car, someone ran in to ask how long the wait was for a party of 4. ""5-10 minutes."" No problem, we have time. OK, valet the car, go inside and wait.Fast forward 25 minutes, we finally ask the hostess what the story is, and she explains ""well, people are just hanging out, it'll probably be another 20-30 minutes."" Wow...sooo....that's at least 5 times the wait you originally promised, plus, did you not think to factor in a pre-event crowd when you started giving wait times? The valet was smart enough to ask if we were headed to the game, so why should you be surprised at the fact that people were on a schedule? All of this while there were multiple clumps of 4 seats available - we weren't waiting for a private table, just anything available. Also worth mentioning that they don't take reservations, so it isn't as if we could have avoided this simply by calling ahead.Kind of disgusted, and out of time, we had to go, we'll just eat at the arena. We asked the hostess to validate the valet ticket, since we hadn't eaten and had been misled, and she was aghast - as if they should never have to do that. Enter the manager, who graciously offered to seat us immediately at some of the available seats I mentioned earlier, but at that point we were just out of time. They did validate the valet, and we beat feet.So. I appreciate the manager's appropriate attention to detail. And I would like to return at some point to try the food, but will remember to do it when I have no place to be. But the host staff are just outclassed. It just looked like they needed some training before they'll be ready to run a place that's this busy."
"Leave work a little early and get here early to beat the rush. No wait for our party of two which is just fantastic for any hot spot. Hot crab dip is so good! And it comes with good old Ritz crackers, no fancy stuff but it worked really well with the dip.We also had fish tostadas and those were very good as well.I also had some type of champagne cocktail and that was also...you guessed it...good!Take away for you: everything is probably good! Go!"
"Really decent if perhaps overhyped restautant. Had a lemon and choc scone and iced coffee to start. Both outstanding. Cheeseburger that followed was good but well done when we requested medium rare. The pickles (and maybe pickled onions?) made it a bit oversour as well, but it was still very good.Shrimp cocktail was great - jumbo shrimp wrapped in thin noodles and briefly fried - while the crab dip was just so so. The breakfast spaghetti was not for me at all.Though we didnt think every dish we ordered was out of this world, I wouldnt hesitate to go back. Especially for an iced coffee and scone - I cant emphasize enough how well executed these two simple, easy to overlook menu items were. That type of fare seems to be where Little Goat shines."
"Feel like I just had an awesome meal at Starbucks. Good quality menu with a heavy hand of pretentious.  Food at the Little Goat diner for the most part is exceptional but atmosphere and service not so much. We had the Benenden Eggs Benedict and the sloppy goat sandwich. Both were very good but Benedict was a home run. It has a creamy fish sauce that's poured over fried eggs, kimchee, pork belly, and biscuit like bread. Damn good. The sauce is esp a good compliment to the kimchee and the  pork and eggs bring it all together. Perfect. The only knock here is that one of my eggs was over cooked. The sandwich was also good...sloppy for sure but very tasty with a warm soft yet crusty bun. Kind of was a more tomatoey pulled pork sandwich with the coleslaw but in a good way. Can't say I enjoyed the wait since every time I've tried to come is over an hour wait and the hostess claimed it was much shorter. And don't like the very pretentious vibe of the crew and overall atmosphere here. Would try again but may order out."
I ordered a few breakfast items to eat for lunch and enjoyed the inventive approach and attention placed on preparation.  They provided some of the best breakfast items I have had.
"Damn it, I checked in but didn't yelp this place the first day it opened. And now 50 reviews are in and my review will be lost amongst them. NOOOOOOOO!!!!! SadnessI had the Beef.It's huge and delicious. Comes with Kimchee, so be prepared for some uber spicy stank breath afterwards. The venue is huge as there are multiple seating upstairs and the bathroom. You can also see the other chefs making the ingredients necessary for the food through the wall on the first floor, or on the second floor on and open table. This place is different than Hannah's Bretzels in terms of the type of sandwiches they are. So I cannot compare the two together. But if I must, I will sadly though, deem Hannah's Bretzels as the winner. Yea, Little Goat gives you more food and costs less, but in terms of taste, I still give the nod to Hannah."
"Have been here for both breakfast and dinner.  Have to say it doesn't live up to the hype.  The food is not bad, but its not worth the wait or the trip.  They try to either elevate typical diner food or put their own spin on comfort food from different cultures.  On paper the menu sounds great but for both breakfast and dinner the food turns out pretty average.  The place is usually packed but can't say that its justified"
"Staff was great. Very nice and attentive. Were cool even when we had to change the reservation from 2 to 3. So, I was pretty excited for the food. Buuuuut I was a tad disappointed. I'm not a super health nut... I just felt that most of the flavors were bc they were soaked/steeped/marinated in fat. Which is fair and normal. But the nachos were like triple fried so the flavor was there (obviously) but ohhh so heavy. It was almost like not pleasant. Like just putting a straw in a tasty deep fryer and going to town. And that was just the appetizer. Anyways, I just felt like it was a gluttinous showdown. And I wasn't digging it. I say go there after a stomach virus and you need to gain a few pounds back. Dang I'm not usually a hater. But yelp is free territory."
"Stopped in here for lunch on a Wednesday.  Had the chick pea salad (added grilled chicken), and loved it.  Added a cup of their tomato/apple soup on the side, which was also yummy.  I'm not a fan of tomato soup in general, but the apple made it just sweet enough, while still enjoying the richness of the tomato.  Back to the salad, it was chock full of very fresh and crunchy veggies, and came topped with a few vegetable fritters on top.  The service was top notch (Rebecca was my server), and included good advice on the selections, as this was my first visit.  I would definitely return for lunch or dinner on a future visit to Chicago!"
"#LittleGoatDiner deserves a 3.5, arguably a 4 stars for their creative menu #Chicago Went to Little goat diner for brunch. WE actually tried to call in to reserve a table. No can do. We were warned however of the 1.25 hour wait. So we walked over and did put our names down for a table, then went to the nearby Haymarket & Brewery for drinks while we waited (see other review).We got our text exactly an hour and 15 minutes later (kudos for punctuality) but the Hosts/Reception not organized at all and we still waited another 20 minutes on arrival to be seated, with several false alarms (""your table's ready- oh wait no, sorry...""). Furthermore we waited all that time only to be set up by restrooms and coffee kitchenette. Grrrrr.Nice dining space, lovely little touches (see my pic of table setting). And I gotta say I loved the menu. So many options. I could safely (and wanted to) order ten different things and be just as happy with the choices. Or so I thought.For drinks we chose the Bellini. It was strong but bit bitterLike fellow yelpers, I went for the Bull's Eye French toast. We also got the Biscuit and Gravy and the Sloppy Goat. The biscuit was not fresh or warm (which surprises me since they have a bakery on sight) but the gravy saved the day- smoked sausage and buttery mushroom- this could have been happiness! The plate, gravy included, wasn't very hot though (it was literally room-temperature food) and it all came out 2 minutes after we placed the order. I think I got someone else's plate- UNACCEPTABLE. The French Toast was well prepared, and the sweetness of the syrup combined with the savory fried chicken was good, but it wasn't amazing. Very creative take on the chicken and waffle standard though. The bull's eye was the best part- a sunny side fried egg nestled in the center of the french toast. Score! The sloppy goat was ok. I enjoyed the squish squash bun but the chili could have been better seasoned. The rosemary coleslaw was a nice touch though and I'd say if you're ok salting to mask blandness, you might give this a try. Again, the food wasn't very warm. We had absolutely no room for dessert. I'd say maybe next time but given the wait and the ""Okay-ness"" of the meal, I don't think there will be a next time. I will try co-owned Girl and the Goat across the street though since I hear that is where the real fuss is- Very excited at the prospect.I RECOMMEND: Making sure you insist your food come warm. EXTRA TIP: a lot of the meals contain pork which a lot of people don't eat. Thought I'd see goat featured more."
"Amazing brunch.  LG had a solid selection of extremely interesting and creative dishes that were classic in nature but pushed boundaries in how they were tweaked.  Crab omelet?   Unreal.  Biscuits and gravy?  Perfectly made biscuit and in a gravy sauce that wasn't so heavy you wanted to explode after.  Tempura mashed potatoes?  What a great idea!  We got there at 1015 on a freezing Sunday and sat pretty quickly but I can only assume post 1030 on a weekend you will always have a wait, but a wait the restaurant deserves and is well worth it."
"So let me preface this review with the concept that I may have ""done goofed"" when ordering here, since I have heard so many great things about Little Goat and about their brunch menu. I went to Little Goat last week on a Sunday for brunch with some friends from out of town, and unexpectedly waited about 30-35 min for a table for 6 (not as long as I had anticipated). The restaurant was vibrant and packed, so I was excited by the atmosphere and the dozens of smiling customers in the dining area.Our server was friendly and fun, and also super cute, so that was a plus. She was attentive and most importantly didn't f*** anything up (cute only goes so far when you're playin' wit a fat man's food). Her recommendations for some things were great as well, like the Goat's Chocolate Milk, which was amazing and rich. To more of my point, the food here simply did not blow me away or make me say, ""Gee golly fellas, this joint sure is keen! This was certainly worth the wait!"" I ordered a fruit cup for my grumpy, hungover friend which was decent, but cost $6 for some chopped pieces of fruit, which is kinda ridiculous, and i ordered the Biscuits and gravy. Now in reference to the caveat above, I think I goofed by ordering this since typically, I don't even read the description of BISCUITS & GRAVY since the recipe is pretty f****** simple (bizkitz + greyvi + sawsij = mee sew hapee). Upon receiving my food though, there were a few major issues.1.) Mushrooms have no f****** place on biscuits and gravy. Now again, the subtext in the menu says its a mushroom gravy, but again i did not read that part, which is my fault. What is not my fault is that the mushrooms were slimy, added no depth of flavor, and seemed to be added to simply be different with no attempt at adding something special and integral to the dish. It made the gravy crappy, which otherwise would have been some decent gravy (gravy is a tough subject for fat people like myself). 2. The Gravy (again). My full order had two honkin' huge and pretty good biscuits on them of which I had no complaints on, but they portioned this gravy out like it was a prison camp. I would say 40% of my dish was gravy-less and for the price and size of the dish, this portion was lamesauce. Totally not enough to enjoy the dish (my friend's was equally lacking as well). Other than the B&G, I ordered a side of hash browns, which were hot, crispy, cheesy, and great. They were also cheaper than the fruit cup, which may or may not make sense to you.Overall, I was unimpressed by the food for what i had expected, though a portion of that was my own fault. I want to go back and give it another try and be more adventurous with the menu, like a typical, not-hungover version of me would do, but with so many other comparable options for brunch (especially in the area), I'm not sure if I will return. PRO TIP* Do yourself a favor and simply yolo a carafe of mimosas like my friend did and your enjoyment of LG will grow exponentially."
"So, I pretty much want to eat EVERYTHING at Little Goat. Unfortuntely, ain't nobody got time for that, so I settled on the Spiced Apple Pancakes & Cheese Grits.Dudes. These pancakes were amazing. They were huge, and hot, and filled with appley deliciousness and topped with oatmeal crumbles. I could only get through a 1/4 of them, so I took them home and ate them up for dinner last night, and they were still delicious. The manfriend had the Breakfast Pasta which he said was amazing.I really can't wait to go back."
"Spotted: Stephanie Izard making her way behind us at the bar, as we attempted to contain our excitement, amidst inhaling our sandwiches.Yes, I am joining the band of 5-star-reviewers for this one. We came when only the ""bread"" part was open at 'lil G... and despite this, everything was oh-so MAGICAL! If this was an indication of how the diner's going to be... without a doubt, I shall return to experience the epicness. We stopped in for a quick bite and ordered two sandwiches: turkey and shrimp. My lunch companion said that it was hands down, BEST SANDWICH he's ever had. I highly recommend the shrimp: the crunchy masa chip combined with hearty pieces of shrimp and avocado = lunch heaven. The turkey came in close second with the honey almonds. We also got the goat chili which came with a bunch o' fixins and a slice of bread. A wintry staple is now 'lil G's goat chili: gamey, luscious, stick-to-your-ribs deliciousness. Can't wait to come back for a meal or mealssss at 'lil G Diner!"
"This was by far my favorite place while visiting Chicago! Every dish we ordered was incredible and fresh. We went twice just to experience more of the menu. The staff is super friendly, helpful and efficient. The French toast, fat Elvis waffle, cheese grits, hash browns, pancakes, all Fantastic! And the best cup of coffee ever!"
Loved the goat chili.We also had a beef sandwich and fish tostadas.All of the dishes were quite yummy!
Solid! Went for lunch. Delish BBQ pork sandwich & buzzing vibe. A must visit.The hostess could do well by taking down a few notches. Save the attitude for your place across the street.I will be going back.
"Deeeelicious. Headed to Little Goat with five girlfriends expecting a long wait and fantastic food. We got: a long wait and fantastic food. Monday at 1, the projected wait for six was an hour and a half but we were seated after an hour. Our waitress Raquel was great, very friendly and attentive. They definitely have the service portion down at Little Goat. The menu is pretty massive, but we perused during our wait. Gina A. was SET on the crumpets. Glad we went with her intuition, they were fantastic and came with this amazing blueberry preserve. We also went with the hot crab dip which was so tasty! We all really enjoyed this. I thought the star of our side dishes was the tempura mashed potatoes. What could be bad about fried mashed potatoes? They came in two large blocks and with a really tasty sriracha-like sauce. Amy F. and I shared the Sloppy Goat and the Wing Style Burger. Both were fantastic and very messy. The bun on the Sloppy Goat was especially delicious. Rachel D.'s meal somehow didn't make it out when the rest of ours did. About thirty seconds later, our waitress was over to apologize. A minute after that, the manager came over to ask if she wanted anything while she waited and that her meal had been comped. A minute after that...her food arrived. No devastating wait but her meal was comped? Again, they really have the service portion of the restaurant down. We consumed a lot of food and everyone only paid about $20. Definitely will be back!"
"I came here on a Saturday at about 130pm knowing there would be a wait but was super surprised when told the wait would be an hour. Because they don't take reservations, it can get pretty crazy in there, but let me tell you - well worth the wait! The experience and the food/drinks make this a great place for family, friends and maybe even a weekend date.I went with my sister-in-law and once we had put our names in we went into the bar/bakery area and ordered Bloody Mary's. They were very well made and garnished, well worth the $10 or $11 they cost. We got seated after about a 50 minute wait.Not being a meat-eater, I asked the waitress for some non-meat options that were popular. She suggested a variety, and told me the Fish Tostadas were her favorite, so that's what I ordered. When they arrived they looked so fancy I wasn't sure if I was going to be able to eat them without making a mess, but actually it went fairly well. The vinaigrette they used on the tostadas was fantastic! I'm not hugely into fish, but these were great!My sister-in-law ordered the Chicken Sandwich, which two months later, she is still raving about! She goes on and on about how fantastic it was and how she's never eaten anything so good. So if you're looking for a good chicken sandwich, she won't shut up about it - so order it already!We then shared a side of Home Fries which are the small stringy kind, but they were good. We also did a side of Mac n' Cheese which was also very delicious, but a little forgettable.Overall, just going here is an experience all tourists and Chicagoans should partake in, and the food makes the wait all worth it."
"They got eight of us seated for lunch quickly without a reservation, and the food was terrific. My Tonkatsu sammie exploded with savory goodness! Others enjoyed the patty melt, which to my delight also comes in a goat meat version. This place is quirky and awesome. Must try."
"Solid 4-stars.  Which to me is the range of above-average goodness.  I want to give more for menu creativity and wide-variety of all-day options but I can't.  Where is the .25 star upgrade when you need it?Little goat has a nice atmosphere for friends and families alike.  They serve adult bevvies for the crowd looking for a little fun, they serve milkshakes and diner drinks for tame evenings or kids.  Their menu ranges from breakfast sweet and savory treats, to monster sized goat laiden burgers and more on the lunch/dinner side.  Prices are quite reasonable (8-12 per entree is a great estimation) and the servings are quite ample for even the hungriest of diners.  I have been a number of times, I will keep going back.  I want my mind to be blown sometime with a monster meaty,gravy,pile of goat goodness to upgrade this place to a 5 (weird, but true).  A must try."
"Awesome! This place was recommended to me by two different friends and various Facebook postings...and it did not displease.We went for Easter Brunch and waited about 30 minutes to be seated. I expected this and wasn't surprised by the time so much as the really cool wait system they have! You leave your cell number and they text you when you're table is ready! Meanwhile, in the opening text message, there is a link so you can see about how many parties are ahead of you in line! This is the first restaurant I've ever seen to use this technology and I was very impressed.The food - everything I ate (and tasted from my parent's plates) was awesome! Yes it is a little expensive and probably shouldn't call itself a diner, but the food is worth it! Just plan ahead.We got: Little Goat Coffee, Cinnamon Roll, Sourdough Toast, Corned Beef Hash, Ham & Cheese Omelette and the Omelette of the Day (something Latin? beans, cheese, avocado, etc.) ALL we great!I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for an interesting twist on the normal brunch route and wanting to splurge on really good food :-)To top it off, the wait staff was extremely welcoming to us!Happy Eating!"
"this place is awesome for brunch. you cannot not order the roasted brussel sprouts, I also had the cuban blueplate which happen to be a special that day and it was ahhhhmazing. while we wait we sip on coffee or mimosa in the back area which is cozy."
"It was excellent. Service was great, food was great. Walked in on a Saturday morning and grabbed two seats at the bar. I wanted to order everything on the menu. I would definitely go back to try more."
"This is a fun diner/bar/cafe all in one.  The main dining area is set up like a classy, ""old school-eque"" diner, and in the back they have a full bar and café.  If you have to wait to be seated, it is nice to go in the back area and have a drink.  Big plus:  Gluten Free menu, AND Dairy Free Menu. When I last ate here, I orderedt the corned beef hash.  It very greasy and surely a hangover cure.  Next time, I am ordering the pancakes (the gluten free, sourdough pancakes look delightful).Staff was friendly, service wasn't bad (we didn't get anything quickly, but the wait staff were attentive, especially with those water refills), and the decor is charming.  It's very loud inside, but you will be too busy stuffing your mouth with food to be able to talk or need to hear anyone talking to you.Fun place to go for a casual meal or snack.  I'll be back for sure."
"Had a great time at the Valentine's Party!!  Good variety of drinks available; fantastic passed appetizers and fun music.  Was a wonderful evening and very unique way to celebrate with not only your significant other but everyone in your life!  Would definitely do it again!!  Thank you to Shannon, Katie and Tara for a wonderful night!"
"We were planning on going to Au Chavel, but because we read the time it opens wrong, we ended up at Little Goat. So the good ... the service was nice enough. Our water glasses and coffee mugs never went empty. The bread basket we started with was amazing. So soft and buttery. And the butter to go with the bread was perfect as well. Slightly sweetened so you don't need jam. Also the cinnamon roll was also amazing. It had cream cheese frosting, which is always a hit in my book. We got one for a table of 4, and we were fighting over the last scrapes of it. I also got a glass of orange juice. The Meh ... well I should start by saying I'm not the biggest fan of fusion food. And going into this meal, I didn't know that the little goat diner was going to be all fusion-y. So, especially when I'm hungry and just want diner style simple foods, this did not hit any spots. This also might be why I was in love with the breads that we started with. But I felt like most fusion food, it just tried too hard to be cool. I only had breakfast foods, so maybe the lunch items are better? But what they called kimchee was korean hot pepper paste. Whatever they called hosin sauce was cut too much with rice vinegar that it lost any of the sweet hosin taste.The Bad ... well there's nothing that's stand out bad. I know these are just so nit picky. But after eating at Girl and Goat a couple night before, this just felt like it should not be called anything Goat related. It was just a general disappointment of a meal outside of the breads and juice. I would come back if I was in the area, because it is one of the few none fast food breakfast in the area. But it's not a place that I will go out of my way for."
"I am a huge fan of diminutive animal restaurants. Seeing the cute little goat character out front made me even more excited to go in. I only wish my appetite was fully functional.So cute, oh man. We went here on a Friday night around 6 or 6:30pm after Haymarket proved to be PACKED. The wait wasn't unreasonable for three people, but we were somewhat crunched for time, so we chose to be seated at the communal table within minutes. They had some weird grapefruit soda/beer mix, Stiegl?, and that was delicious and I wish I knew about it in the summertime.  The decor of the restaurant is very nice, and though it was quite loud and somewhat hard to hear what my dinner partners were saying. The bathroom vents/fans/whatever are loud and bass-y, which was rather weird. My fruit bowl didn't look very appetizing, but it was really delicious. It was a definite BOWL of fruit and I couldn't even finish it. We shared some fries and macaroni and cheese, which were also delicious and were reasonably sized. I definitely plan on heading back to this place when I can so I can fully experience and enjoy their menu!"
"Best thing about my meal: cup of goat chili, slice of Elvis cake. Bad taste in the mouth: the blonde receptionist, who seated everyone else before us (even the walk ins with no reservations), pretended to text us to tell us our seats were available but actually did not do so, ignored our brown faces even when we were right in front of her, then sat us near the bar even when plenty of tables and chairs were available. The waitress was sweet, as was the bakery salesperson. But that receptionist needs a major sitdown with the owners."
"I've been to Little Goat a handfull of times, and it's unforuntate that I waited to have a bad experience before writing a review.  Past experiences have been hit or miss, but overall the food quality was good.  My fiance and I went again last Saturday, and it seemed like the ""B-Team"" was working.  Service was very slow, customer service was poor, and the food was a disaster.  I ordered the beef ravioli, which (along with everything else) has a sparse description.  What came to the table was a goopy, soggy, unfortunate looking mess of a meal.  After attempting to eat the food for a few minutes, I decided to send it back and request something simpler (more standard).  Despite being painfully slow, our waitress was polite and exhanged out the meals.  When the check came, we discovered that we were charged for both meals.  The waitress fixed the oversight, although we had to physically carry the check to kitchen after waiting for 15 minutes. This entire experience was on top of waiting for 40 minutes at the bar despite the fact we had a reservation."
"I feel really bad about this rating, and I was *so* excited to try this place. However, the combination of some of the worst service I've ever experienced, an extremely loud environment, and meh food does not allow me to give a higher rating. I waited almost a week to write this review so I could calm down and write a fair review.First, we made a reservation for 7:00 PM. We arrived around 6:55, notified the hostess we were there, and she informed us we would need to wait at least 20 minutes if we didn't want to sit at a communal table. What was the purpose of the reservation?! This was a frustrating way to begin the evening. We were seated at the worst table in the restaurant- a booth next to the hostess stand at the end of the row. First, there is a clear panel that separates it from the table next to it, which was extremely distracting, but I can get over it. What I can't get over is the fact that EVERY staff member who walked by bashed into or slapped the back of my bench, which was extremely disruptive to my meal. Seriously, if you get seated here, ask them to seat you anywhere else- even the counter!Our waiter was totally absent. After we ordered, he was just nowhere to be found. It took us about 15 minutes to track him down to order a second drink (by the way, we ordered entrees, small plates, and booze, so he was in for a potentially good tip if he just provided minimum service). After ordering it, it took him 10 minutes to deliver it, and I seriously considered telling him I no longer wanted it. He did not offer us a dessert menu, and ran away before we could ask for one. Fine. It took us TWENTY minutes to get him to come back to the table in order to get the check. We had to ask the hostess for help finding him, and he couldn't even make eye contact when he finally returned with it. It took at least ten minutes to get him to process it and come back. In his defense, he looked busy, but if he had mentioned to us that he had a lot of tables or that someone had called in, we would have cut him more slack-  it was his attitude in combination with the long wait times that was just unacceptable.I would consider returning to try something else, but I would sit at the counter, and go as soon as they open. I would not go out of my way to return here, and would not recommend it."
"Glad I had a reservation. Got the korean burger, shared fries with a friend and we split the Choco Taco dessert (which, isn't actually a taco). Everything was very good, the korean burger was big and tasty but the kimchi wasn't my cup of tea. Fries were plentiful (as they should be) and the choco taco was good, but hard to eat and not omg-amazing like other yelpers claim. Glad I checked this place out it was adorable and had some really interesting looking plates."
Very unique fair and exceptionally reasonable. A fantastic lunch spot.
"We got.. Tempura Mashed Potatoes $5.00 / Absolutely disgusting!Tonkatsu $12.00 / If you're authentic Korean.. DO NOT EAT THIS!! It's just terribly wrong in so many ways. Shrimp Cocktail: $15.00 / It was tasty, but did not vein out. Fried Chicken: $18.00 / I can't express my disappointment. skin was watery and just slipped off, and was tasteless and most importantly DRY!!Garlic Mash Potatoes: $5.00 / GoodSloppy Goat: $13.00 / Absolutely disgusting!! Smoked fries: $6.00 / WAYYYYY overpriced for not even freshly cut!!French Toast:16.00 / Can't comment.. couldn't try anymore.. I am a business owner, and i would hate to write such poor review such as this.. but, enough is enough already!! i read reviews (VERY GOOD REVIEWS) on yelp before trying out Little Goat Diner only to be extremely disappointed. Are the reviews on Yelp FAKE?? or has Chicagoans completely lost their taste in good food?? Oh BTW.. They don't take phone orders.. You must order at the restaurant bar. If that's their way of generating a bit more revenue on bar sales, it's messed up!Customer convenience should have been considered. **I have offered to pre-pay over the phone using my credit card. The lady answering phone, ""NO!!"" If you think I sound like a disgruntled lunatic.. fine. Try it!"
"This place is decent for brunch and lunch.  I have to admit, I've not dined here for dinner or late night dining, so I can't say much about those time periods.  However, for breakfast and lunch this location is pretty amazing.  The menu selections are plentiful and everything we've ordered has been great tasting and well presented.  This place is slightly on the pricey side, but then again, pretty much every eating establishment on W .  Randolph St is kind of upscale.  Overall, I love the ambiance of the place.  It's kind of funny that there is now a sign which indicates where the restrooms are because when this location first opened, no one was able to find the restrooms since the wallpaper blended the door with the rest of the wall. : )"
"YUMMM!!!We went on a Sunday... got there around 1:00. They told us it would be a 45 minute wait. We walked around (thank goodness they have the ""texting system"" so we didn't have to stand there in the restaurant forever). Luckily, after 20 minutes, we got a text and got a table! By the time we sat down for another 20 minutes, there were a ton of tables open, so I'd recommend holding your hunger until 1:30ish so you don't have to wait a long time outside.We got the crab dip with Ritz crackers to start... OMG the crab dip is AMAZING!!! Idk if I'm a fan of the Ritz crackers... seems a bit low class... I think they should use bread instead, like the Clubhouse. But the crab dip was DELICIOUS.My fiance got the goat chocolate milk. It was not bad, tasted like normal chocolate milk but there were some white chunks of milk in it which was kinda gross to see.My fiance got the Los Drowned sammich. He really liked it, it was unique. It had kimchi with braised beef and was very moist!I got the patty melt... holy cow it was scrumptious! It was very messy with sauce all over the place but definitely yummy.The appetizer filled us up a lot and we only finished about half of our actual meal.This place was a lot different than Girl and the Goat (across the street), as it is more of a brunch place than a tapas place.I would definitely come back here and try more! ^_^"
"On a warm summer day, I underwent a 2-mile walk from my hotel, dragging my suitcase behind me, in order to visit Little Goat (too cheap to hail a cab).  I had been saving Little Goat for my last stop during a mini-Chicago vacation, looking forward to the visit all week.  I arrived around 10 AM on a weekday, and was easily able to get a seat at the bar top. My server was very kind about my bulky suitcase, and gently moved it against a wall. I had planned out my dining choices in advance, and ordered the Asian Breakfast Tasty Thingy and the blueberry goat cheese pie. I loved the Asian thingy, as expected; it messily combined all my favorite ingredients...kimchi, eggs, bacon, sprouts, and savory pancake topped w. lots of Sriracha and asian-style dipping sauce.  The pie serving was not a typical slice, but a wonderful, miniaturized not-too-sweet blueberry pie topped with the perfect complement of goat cheese gelato. Halfway through the meal, I noticed David Schwimmer enjoying a fruit bowl incognito at a nearby booth. Any minor celebrity-related stupor was quickly replaced by mild outrage...""Just a fruit bowl David? At Little Goat? Really?"". Service was good and not intrusive, respectful of a single diner, her suitcase, and her poor attempts to stay cool and avoid ogling Schwimmer.On the way out, I grabbed a loaf of bacon & gouda bread from the bakery side, to take back to Indy.  It smelled delicious and made the MegaBus trip back home a little bit more enjoyable, as I opened the loaf bag for intermittent whiffs of bacon and fresh-baked bread all the way down I-65."
"Ate breakfast.  Had Biscuit and gravy, and some hashbrowns.   Excellent coffee.  Food was nothing special.The Good:-Comfortable dining room-Charm of a traditional, greasy-spoon diner mixed with the posh of an upscale restaurantThe Bad:-Upscale and greasy-spoon don't mix well.-Food was nothing special.-Felt like the pricey breakfast had more to do with the setting, than with the quality of the food.Bottom line:Not much value.  Could get better food, for a better price, with a similar atmosphere somewhere else in the West Loop."
A great restaurant! Diner appeal with gourmet food. The Little Goat Diner is so much fun and has a wonderful vegan menu. Leave room for dessert-the turtle pie was spectacular-even the next day! Make a reservation as this place gets crowded.  Groups-this is a great place for you.
"I've been there twice with a large group of people. The first time we were seated on the roof, and the last time we got a large table outside.Food/drinks: 2/5. As much as I like Girl&the Goat, this place is just mediocre. I had Mac&Cheese and crab dip with Ritz crackers. Mac&Cheese was average, I thought they could've done so much more with Gouda to make it a bit smoky maybe. Crab dip was simply bad. We couldn't taste any crab in it and it was incredibly greasy. The worst part both time were the drinks. Their bartenders have no idea what they are doing. The first time we had very bad gin drinks, so this time we asked for a bartenders suggestion  on gin drinks. He offered gin and lime. What? You've got to be kidding me!  Assuming it's nearly impossible to screw up gin&tonic, we opted out for that....except it was $10/each. Atmosphere: 3/5 Your regular diner that's trying too hard to be cool.Service: 2.5/5 Our server didn't know the menu and couldn't offer any suggestions.Overall: 2/5. Won't be going there any time soon."
They're now on OpenTable! Get a reservation!I came here with my coworkers for a quick weekday lunch bite. We were fortunate enough to get seated right away by arriving at 11:45AM. By 12PM the line was ridiculously long and out the door!!I ordered the 'Korean' beef burger (comes with kimchi/egg/bacon/spicy mayo... and 'squish/squash' bread). The best part about this burger = the bread. SOOO good! I would describe the bread as a pretzel-croissant hybrid. Never had anything like it. Yum.Cute place. Good breakfast/lunch spot. However not sure if I would come here for dinner.
"The biggest criticism of Little Goat is that the menu is a mish-mosh, as they say in Yiddish.  The audio playlist was another symptom of mish-mosh- the songs skipped from nineties hip hop to pops songs from the 2000s to current EDM.  I can understand how some people look at Au Cheval down the street with its much smaller menu and curated reel-to-reel mixes and make comparisons.  Little Goat is new and already doing many things well.  The breads tasted so fresh with great texture.  My los drowned sandwich was full of the flavor of slowly stewed beef and balanced by the tangy spicy pickles and peppers.  The milkshake with salty sweet chocolate taco shards in savory sour cream gelato was genius.  The challenge going forward will be tweaking the devil in the details.  The future looks bright for Little Goat."
"It is everything that everyone says about the place.My wife and I were in town for the weekend and ate at the Diner multiple times. We had some very nice dinners in town, but after lunch at the Little Goat Diner, we canceled our remaining reservations and ate at the Diner back to back evenings. The staff is friendly and the food is great."
"Wow.....Little Goat serves up some good stuff. This place has a really nice ""package"". The service was super, the ambiance is contemporary diner-esque, and the food is da BOMB. They offer typical diner fare with their own cool little twists. My husband had the smoked corned beef hash, which was awesome as well. A couple things that we appreciated besides the food was the coffee shop that's attached and the seating system. Our wait was 20-25 minutes and the entry area was crowded, so having the option of hanging out in the coffee shop while we waited was really nice. We also liked that they text you when your table is ready instead of giving you crappy pagers or just screaming your name. Texting gives you the freedom to wonder about outside or whatever while waiting. We will definitely be visiting Little Goat in the future."
"A big plus of Little Goat is that there's a ton of seating, so while other restaurants on Randolph are crowded even on weeknights, I've never had to wait here. Their veggie burger and chocolate malt are the capital-b Best. The menu has a lot of crazy combinations with funny names, and I'm not adventurous enough to try a pork milkshake or fried pickle, but I'm sure it's all great! Major cherry on top is the photobooth!"
"Little Goat is a solid go to place when I'm in the West Loop. It's great for kids. I find the wait is never as long as the hostess tells you it's going to be.  But there will be a wait. Some tables are communal. It's bright. It's lively.  I've always had outstanding service. Food comes out promptly and is always hot. A go to item of mine is the crisp shrimp cocktail. It can be enough for a lunch on its own. The fish tostadas are quite a filling and tasty (the batter doesn't overpower the fish). They are topped with a great slaw.  There's usually a vegetarian soup. Soups are good but not great.  Burgers are a kid fave. I really enjoy their shakes, but wish the serving was bigger.  That's me loving my dessert."
"Holy Chicago food lover! I came here after a run and left thinking I needed to go for a second run. This current trip was my foodie trip so I made my way over into Goat Country for a late lunch.  Walking into The Little Goat, it's a clean space and set up very well.  You have a bunch of different options (booths, bar, island type seating).  I came for a late lunch around 1:30, but there were still a good amount of people around.Food: good sizes and good portions.  If I weren't flying out of Chicago the next day, I would have done left overs for sure.  I ordered the Sloppy Goat and definitely something I'd go back for.  Sloppy for sure, so I went after it with a fork but it was delicious non the less.  It came out hot in about 10 minutes or less, including the bun.Dessert: I ordered the turtle pie.  Cookie crust filled with nuts, carmel and whip cream deliciousness.I'm thinking this is a going to be a regular place to go to when I come back to visit"
"Excellent food, really awesome flavors."
"Overall, Little Goat is pretty good. Service is good -- really friendly and informative, if they are able to get to you. They are just running around quite hastily and might be a bit understaffed. Food portions are pretty large and, naturally,  pretty filling. Obviously very diner-ish and had some Asian twists to it. Pricing is actually quite good and won't break you wallet. Drinks are around $10, which is good. However, my whiskey-based cocktail was quite sweet and took away from the whiskey itself. Good spot to just hang with friends or to being out of towners. Just waiting to visit the rooftop and see what that is all about."
"A bit underwhelmed with the dessert menu at the place we dined at, remembering my friends had the smoke pork milkshake here, which is just down the block from where we were, I took my out of town friends here :)Our inner child all surfaced when we saw the dessert section. Smoke pork milkshake, the cheez-it sundae, the apple chedder pie...The smoke pork milkshake easily won hands down. The smoky after taste made you feel like you just left a bbq joint.I don't quite get teh cheez-it sundae though. The icecream wasn't yellow, nor cheesy, so why the name?! It was just like a strawberry icecream sundae with peanut butter swirl on top...the apple cheddar pie...where is the cheddar? it tastes like a healthy oat crusted apple pie with icecream....o...well, at least i checked off the smoke pork milkshake from my foodie list..."
delicious brunch! the bull's eye french toast was phenomenal!
"Went there on a saturday afternoon. Waited a bit, not a big problem. Ordered a great mocha while waiting. Got  sat, service was pretty good once he made it to our table. Based on everything I read/heard I expected something more. Yes, I know food, taste etc is subjective but the food I had (BBQ Pork Sammie) was barely good even by diner standards. And for the price and low quality food, I wouldnt go back. Lesson learned. Note as you go in, menu is all a-la-carte."
"Great food, great service! Soooo delicious!!! Everything everyone ordered was amazing. Not enough space in my stomach!!! Plus a bar!!!"
"Food was amazing.  We had the Ruben mac and cheese,  crab dip, and the butterfinger dessert. Everything was tasty. We will definitely be back!"
"Staff are nice, the food is fantastic and whimsical, like a Michelin diner. Will be back again."
"Little Goat packs BIG Flavor in its Food! Breakfast is Served ALL DAY. Huge Menu with a lot of Great options, here are some of my highlights.Breakfast Options:Fat Elvis Waffles (Peanut Butter-Butter? Yes Please!)Asian-Style Breakfast ThingyBull's Eye French Toast (The Combination of Sweet & Savory is on Point)Sandwiches:Reuben (VERY Tasty)Los Drowned (Another greatly composed Sandwich)Goal Almighty Burger (If the Price is okay with you, You have to Try this Burger)The Hot Crab Dip is also another hidden gem on the menu. Great for a starter dish (Don't feel shy asking for more Crackers)Sweet Tooth?Get There EARLY if you want to try their Ooey Gooey Cinnabuns because they go QUICK !!!"
"Love the staff here!Both the staff in little goat bakery and restaurant are very nice and willing to give advice. As to food, I tried their scone and conchas, they are good but not outstanding. I also tried the brunch in their restaurant. I ordered BRANDADE AND BELLY, though the combination of these ingredients are pretty weird to me, I found it taste good actually. I love the creamy biscuits especially."
"Awesome food and service. Had the blue plate special- cubano sandwich with ham, cheese, pork belly, pickled onions, grilled to perfection topped with two eggs and served on top of mushroom mole.  Pure heaven dreamed up by a line cook I'm sure.  If you get a chance to go, it's a must.  We need Little Goat in Phoenix."
"Have you ever been so hungry but actually stopped to smell your food before you ate it?  I never had but at the Little goat did it before every bite.  It smelled so good and tasted even better.   The cross between a dinner and a high end restaurant is genius. The prices for the quality of food is a steal.  The staff was super friendly.  Recommendations on food: Ruben, Sloppy Goat, and Fries (seriously you will just love smelling them).  Go with a friend and split a shake for dessert, recommend the apple caramel.  I am drooling about going back but I live out of town."
Great food- consistent quality! Sat at the bar once and it was not my favorite but it was better than having to wait a long time for a table. Wish the cocktails were a little more matched with the breakfast/diner food.
"I lovedoveloved Girl and the Goat and was so excited to be blown away by Little Goat, but I have to say I was a bit disappointed. At around 7 on a Monday night the wait was only around a half hour - totally doable. But during prime brunch hours, I wouldn't imagine this place making it into the rotation. Right now it's not worth quite worth a super long wait. The decor is very laid back. It's bright, with lots of mellow brown tones. It's a ""diner"" concept, but the inside is still quite elegant. It's nice.The coffee was LEGIT. Awesome americano. Totally deep and rich flavors. It was dinner time and I just had a cup of coffee in the afternoon, but I had to try theirs. Don't worry, I still food coma'd from the food and collapsed just fine after I got home. Anyway, coffee was a huge plus for the night.The food... Well. I'm still not sure if I had too high of expectations coming in. We were starving from a small lunch, so we ordered 2 breakfasts and an entree, and a burger. While everything was ...good, nothing we had (shrimp and grits, asian pancake breakfast tasty thingy, korean burger with beef patty, pork belly pancake) was super exciting. Everything seemed kind of one dimensional, actually. I was expecting all these unique dishes to be very interesting. Memorable. Something was missing here that is very distinctly present across the street. Maybe my expectations were too high? I had looked forward to its opening for like 10 months. I'll probably come back to give it another chance, probably on a weeknight and try some non Asian-influenced dishes to see if they fare any better. 3.5 stars."
"Don't believe the hype, there are way better places. Waited more than an hour to pay too much for bad food. They were out of what we wanted, so we had to settle for 2nd choice. I don't understand Izard's obsession with goat. I like goat meat when prepared well, but the sloppy goat was just awful. The salads were even worse. We were completely underwhelmed by the burger. Kids' size Mac 'n cheese was half the size of kids' portions at any other restaurant. The root vegetable side was meh. All we had that was really good were potatoes--which are kind of hard to mess up. I do like the little take-out area on the side, however.  Good bread, coffee, tea, and the best $3 oatmeal-to-go I've ever had.  This oatmeal alone is worth one star--the main restaurant fall short and only gets two."
"Delicious diner food that is a step above.We showed up on a Saturday evening, but did not have to wait very long to get a table. It gave us a chance to check out the bread and make me disappointed that I was from out of town.Service was prompt and nice. We had a variety of dishes at our table, and everyone was very happy. The goat chili cheese fries were delicious. My friend ordered the smoked pork and toffee crunch shake, which was great but not super-porky.I had the Los Drowned, which was so tasty and so huge. I ended up tearing it apart and just eating bits and pieces because I couldn't stand to have any of that delicious meat go to waste."
"As good as it gets, indeed. I loved every bite of the food at this place. There is usually a wait, but it is well worth it. I don't even like sweets but their cream cheese cake was absolutely amazing as was their pulled pork nachos, their eggs, and their fries. I was blown away. I ate far too much but wow. I will be back next time I'm in Chicago. I would order anything off their menu with confidence that it will be delicious and expertly cooked.Little Goat, sweet Little Goat. You are beautiful and glorious, the way you deep fry chips so saltily and tenderly, the way your pork just falls apart like little heavenly pork-clouds. Thank you for knowing how to cook and for serving the people of Chicago. I will spread the word: Little Goat is the way."
"A twist on diner food and a variation to Stephanie Izard's famous Little Girl and the Goat restaurant down the street, this place is a fun adaption to American cuisine.  Unlike it's sister restaurant, expect the food here to be big, and by that, I mean the portion. It would be wise to share. Try a little of everything; it's hard to go wrong."
"We came to The Little Goat rooftop diner to start our July 4th celebration. The menu is limited to four items, I'm not sure if that is for the holiday or full time. My husband and I ordered the Lots of Layers dip, the Korean dog and the pork kabobs. The dip was tasty and creamy but not really my favorite. The pork kabobs were amazing. A nice soy based with grilled pineapple and other veggies. The hot dog has kimchi and fried onions, it was really good. The servers are attentive without being intrusive. The roof top is an amazing space, I highly recommend it."
"The bartender here made me the best hot toddy I've ever had, and I grew up in the South. This is a good place for really creative fusion. The decor is straight hipster and the music is always good. Generally packed and often pretty loud -- so if you're looking for a nice intimate dinner this is probably not the best place. The food is consistently great. The biscuits and gravy (my Southerner is showing) are a total hit and taste just like the handmade buttermilk biscuits my Gran would serve up when I was a kid. [It's difficult to quantify how good that really is.] The fried chicken was a total miss, but we can't have everything. The Bulls Eye French Toast is *fantastic* and a perfect dish if you're wanting sweet and savory. The apple(?) pancakes are a little too sweet for me, but if you like sweets then it's definitely for you. The burgers are awesome. A note: if you're celiac, the celiac burger is more like a ""celiac steak taco"" according to our friend who ordered it.  We live down the street and this is our go-to diner for quick eats when friends visit. If you've never been: you should go at least once!"
"Very good diner with some interesting takes on classic food (e.g. kimchi in unexpected places, goat burgers). The portions tend to be large and/or heavy, so I'd recommend splitting your food unless you're starving. What I've tried:- Los Drowned (cheesy beef sandwich with spicy mayo and peppers). Heavy but very tasty. - The Fat Club (club sandwich but with ""special sauce"" and avocado). Definitely a winner! I couldn't finish it, but rest assured that the second half was demolished later.- Mac N' Cheese (very savory, goat-cheesy). So good but definitely a strong aftertaste. The side order is MASSIVE.If you're in the mood for quirky American food served big, this is your place."
My favorite breakfast in the city!! Little goat latte and sourdough toast can't be matched!!
"I visited the Little Goat Diner on a trip to Chicago earlier this year and cannot stop thinking about their biscuits and gravy.  I would go there every week, just for that, if I didn't live 800 miles away.  The coffee was also pretty awesome, so all in all, it was a hit.  If you're in Chicago, it's a must!"
"Little Goat just doesn't live up to the hype for me, unfortunately. I just can't see myself ever craving the food here and wanting to go back. That being said, the shrimp cocktail was pretty good, my favorite dish of the night. Nothing else really blew me away."
"The diner is open!  As much as it pains me, I'm bringing it down a star from the bread portion only review.  Things were good but overall not as impressive as G&tG or even the sandwich portion of the bread side.  Possibly there's just too many dishes and they need more time to perfect everything.The menu is pretty extensive and everything is a la carte.  My parents and I tried:- Kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes - this was the standout of the 3 orders.  If you're expecting pancakes in the traditional style, you'll be confused.  It's all kind of thrown together and the flavors complement each other well.- Duck Banh Mi - this was a pretty tasty banh mi, but I've definitely had better.  I think maybe a bit more pickle in the veggies to cut through some of the heavier confit and liver flavor?  Still a solid choice though.- Omelette special of the day - I think I misunderstood the waitress and thought this was going to be more of a Spanish style omelette.  It had masa chips, cheese, and I think pepperoncinis.  Overall pretty underwhelming flavor-wise.The portions are large and we were definitely stuffed.  They don't take reservations, but when you check-in they'll take your phone number and send you a text when your table is ready.I'll definitely be back to try more of the offerings.  Would it be excessive to try and get through everything on the menu?  Sounds reasonable actually."
"My friend works the sandwich bar and I decided to swing by before hand to relax instead of just picking him up. I walked into the hostess station and asked if my friend was working but they had no idea. I ended up just walking back to the bar and there he was. I mentioned it to him and there were apparently some 'communication issues.' I was getting hungry and since we were getting set to put our drinking pants on I should line my stomach with something. The sandwich bar was closing in 30 minutes so my bud handed me the sandwich menu and the diner menu. I love sandwiches so I went with the beef sandwich, with a little trepidation. I saw that kimchi was in it and while I love sandwiches and I love kimchi never the two should meet. Until now! The kimchi was a great addition to the sandwich and it was perfect type for it. Cabbage kimchi, not overly ripe (I think it would have been terrible if they used slightly sour kimchi,) the right balance between to soft/chewy and crisp/hard. The little sandwich made me rethink of my arbitrary barrier between Korean food and everything else. My sis was nowhere near as hungry as me and she ended up ordering the crumpets and chorizo, which was a soft, savory/slightly sweet, and then she turned around and just ordered rolls and butter.We also got some beers, but apparently the beer list they had was inaccurate so it was like playing Blind Man's Bluff but drinking. I ordered one I didn't like and when I let him know that it wasn't something I liked he took it away and gave me an Alpha King without charging me. ""I'm not going to let you drink something you don't like."" The only other gripe I had really didn't have to do with the place, as it got later in the evening a large rush of people came into the bar to wait, it was like a game of sardines but with people you don't know and everyone is reaching over you to order a drink."
"Solid breakfast spot. I really like the shrimp and grits. The pancakes are delicious and the service is good. If it wasn't for the parking and Saturday morning line, I could easily become a regular."
"Finally had a chance to come here on a Saturday afternoon. Parking was fairly easy, and free if you park on a side street! With a group of 6 at 1 pm, we had to wait an hour to be seated. When we were finally seated, we were unfortunately seated at one of the two long tables that reminded me of a high school cafeteria. We were squeezed in next to other lunching groups, and both I and the girl next to me were uncomfortable and had to be careful to keep our elbows in! If you get stuck at one of these tables, be prepared to hear every word of another groups' conversation. The decor of the place is nice, and the tables are nice if you get a private booth, but it is very loud. It was very hard to hear, and I couldn't talk to the person across from me two seats down because of the noise level.Our waiter seemed disinterested, but I give him props for being quick and efficient. We got our coffee quickly, except for the cappuccino, and our food came out fairly quickly as well. Three people got pancakes, one a grilled cheese, and I shared the Brandade and belly (14) and goat burger korean style (13). People were happy with their meals, and we loved the two asian inspired dishes. The goat burger was perfection. I wasn't sure if I would like goat, but I sure did! It was juicy, and everything about it was just delicious. The brandade and belly was interesting too and I was glad I got it. It was kind of like an asian eggs Benedict. They were generous with the pork belly,and it was cooked just right. The kale and kimchi went very well together too. All the portions were large, but we finished almost everything. The bill for 6 people, including coffees, came out to $100 flat, which was funny (before tip). I would definitely recommend giving Little Goat a try, but maybe with a smaller group so you have the chance of getting a booth, and so you can actually hear everyone."
Great spot for a celebration with 4 big eating guys and a gal. Great cocktails and nachos to start. Good selection of beers too. The best fried chicken my husband ever had...and he's had a lot! Love  the pork belly pancake and Los drowned Sammy. Amazing to come and have no wait and good service too!
"I get it, it's Stephanie Izard and that is reason enough to add LG to your Chicago bucket list. It's been on mine for quite some time so I finally made the journey. It was a Monday around noon and I wasn't surprised to learn when I called that there was a 20 minute wait. The nice surprise was parking was a plenty and free! Walked in, gave our name and phone number and headed to the washroom. I counted about six empty tables so while there probably was a good reason for the wait, the perception was...why exactly do we have to wait 20 minutes during my hour long lunch break? Side note, big fan of the wall papered doors and hand dryers in the bathrooms.They text us when our table was ready and we had our choice of inside or outside, bonus! Server was able to speak to the menu options and give us some recommendations. We started with the fried pickles and onion rings. These were really more like tempura than fried pickles and I mean that in the very best way possible. The curry mustard dipping sauce was nothing less than inspired! Off to a great start....then I ordered the pork belly pancake and went splitsies with my friend who ordered the Los Drowned. I definitely win when it comes to best orderer of the lunch! Pork belly was buried in a plethora of pickled veggies with the most perfect balance of hoison sauce. It wasn't overwhelming to any of the other flavors, including the subtle scallion tones of the crispy pancake. I did not care for the Los Drowned. The braised beef had a thick line of fat through it. I didn't find it all that tender. It was a little messy to eat and I couldn't taste much of the avocado, but I did get a lot of the roasted pepper flavor. Might have to say, maybe too much. So two sandwiches (ala carte) and a shared appetizer of friend pickles, water and the bill split two ways was about $21 per person. I was fully aware going in that this is what it would be, but I hate to be that guy to say it might have been slightly overhyped and a little overpriced. Glad I went. I would go again, but it wouldn't be based on my suggestion."
"Trust me when I say a 5 star rating is sparse for me. This place is one of bests in Chicago. More affordable and tastier than Girl & Goat across the street (owned by the same chef). I've been here 3 times already, once for dinner and twice for breakfast. First visit I got the pork belly pancake. Pretty good. We also ordered the garlic cheese bread (OMG YUM), fries and mac and cheese (also highly recommended).Second visit I got the brandade and belly (so good. I wanted to get it my third visit but I thought I'd try something new) and third was the kimchi bacon pancake asian tasty thingy (literally what it's called). Both were amazing. I also got the ooey gooey cinnamon bun (they don't lie...it really is ooey and gooey). By far the best thing I've had here are the hash browns. I'm not a huge fan of hash browns to begin with but these are the best I've ever had. They're crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a hint of cheese. AMAZING.Come here and be warned by the massive wait. I suggest taking a day off and coming during an off time (even then I""m sure you'll have to wait a little). No reservations."
"I don't understand why people will wait over an hour to eat here...! The food is ok, not horrible but not worth an hour wait. For a place that serves mediocre burgers and overly greasy food I don't understand the hype. We went on a Saturday night and waited way too long to sit at the counter only to listen to the kitchen manager yell at the staff for our entire meal (awkward)... We got chili cheese fries, tuna sandwich and patty melt, none of which was worth the wait or the experience. We won't go back."
"Brunch time yummy !!!!Eating is a way to enjoy Chicago's winter Life. I went to LITTLE GOAT for brunch today, price range is around $25 per person. There was a short wait when we arrived at 11:30 A.M., thanks for the tip Kelsey Che , we get seated within 30 minutes. The atmosphere was trendy and classy, perfect for brunch. For entree, we ordered Brandade and Belly, and the BULL's eye french toast. Brandade and Belly, which served with brandade, pork belly, sunny side eggs, biscuit and kimchi. According to wikipedia, brandade is a dish consisting of salt cod mixed into olive oil and milk. This dish was very interesting and unique. It was similar to Benedict, maybe Korean one? haha The pork belly cooked perfectly and very juicy. It went well with Kimichi. Glad that I ordered it. For BULL's eye French toast, it caught my eyes which had eggs, CRISPY chicken, sweet onion brioche, and bbq maple syrup. The egg cooked perfectly with yolk once you cut through. You could taste egg, onion, chicken, syrup, and fresh strawberries all at once. It is a mixed favor with sweet and savory. It was absolutely delicious. Lastly, for the drink, ""THE LITTLE GOAT"", it is espresso, chai species and goat's milk. Also you will find the little goat logo is hidden inside the coffee cup, which it was very cute ! What a casual place with quality food. Once again, it is a Perfect place for BRUNCH."
I was there in late summer with my husband and 2 friends from California for a brunch. I had a type of an omelette with horseradish cream inside which if you like horseradish or are tempted to try it was outstanding. I ATE the whole thing. YUMMO.
"Would have liked to have rated it no stars, but couldn't,but we left after a 15 minute wait for sodas and 20 minute wait to see if the waiter was going to come and take an order.  After a 40 minute wait for a table on a Sunday afternoon (2:00pm) you get a text saying come back we are ready to seat you.  We come in and you again get to wait a few more minutes.Took us to a booth for two, but directly across from us were larger booths that could seat 4, but each one had only two patrons, so as we are not petite gals and would have appreciated being accommodated, I asked for the larger booth.  Oh no, the gal says, we are setting this booth for 4 people who were waiting.  Ok, that's fine, certainly could understand that.....but within the next minute, they seated two young gals there.  We weren't trendy enough for their clientele?..Come on!  I was appalled at that point!Menu was quite unusual, with a big Korean food influence.  If we wanted Korean food, we would have gone to a Korean restaurant.  Not what either of us expected and neither of us found the selections too appealing.  All the hype and heck, I could get a patty melt anywhere..nothing special about that, I wanted something that sounded good.    Nothing really did.  Kimchi was one of the sides and other items I had never heard of, with no explanations of what those were.  I'm not a newbie to dining, whatsoever and my friend was a chef instructor and we both were very disappointed, so we left after our wait.Told the young ladies at the hostess stand that we were leaving because we didn't get waited on, and their comment was: You don't want to wait?  Ummmno,we waited long enough......never again, sorry!  No recommendations from us.  Rude!"
"Good food and ambience . It was a little noisy though. I would recommend to make reservations , it's easier to get here than the girl and the goat. We had a chicken sandwich and build your own burger with goat patty. It was delicious! Also the fries were amazing! Will go next time for milkshakes !"
"I can't remember ever having food at a restaurant better than this! Lots of gluten free TASTY options. Fun, friendly atmosphere. Excellent customer service. I HIGHLY recommend eating here! Do make a reservation though."
"Awesome breakfast. Great service. Recommendations: fat Elvis, blueberry pancakes, the little goat latte."
"I ordered the fried pickle ""sammich"" which was amazing. It was an unexpected, but phenomenal combination of naan, hummus, tzatziki, kale, fried pickle, onion rings and red peppers. It was a nice vegetarian option. the sides are a la carte, but are totally shareable. I seriously recommend the fries. They were so fresh and tasty and were seasoned perfectly. A definite must-try.My friend had some sort of ""sammich"" with goat. It was his first experience with that type of meat, but he really liked the flavor. I'd say the menu is a little pricey. but i like what they have to offer. I would like to try their espresso, if i were to return. perhaps i will breakfast next time too. the atmosphere was nice, and the place was decorated/themed well. the service was okay. Overall, they have a lot of unique dishes to offer and they serve breakfast all day. As a vegetarian, i didn't try their namesake Goat, but it was still a pleasant experience."
"I was wary of the hype, but this place was amazing. Went solo on a business trip and had a goat burger, pea tendrils, and took a turtle pie to go. Everything was amazing. The burger was delicious and cooked perfectly, and the pea tendrils, which I was told are cooked in Stephanie's saute sauce that they also sell in bottles, were amazing though a little oniony for my taste. The turtle pie was a decadent entire small pie with the best cookie crust I've ever had, and smothered in delicious caramel and cashews. (Definitely sharing size.) Amazing, and can't wait to go back. Made an opentable res  but there was no wait for one or two people to sit at the counter on a Sun night."
"to be straight up honest.. this place is just MEHstaff is huge.. and a mix of super friendly to decent peopleive gone here about three times.. twice for dinner i believea bit on the darker side lighting-wiseand this place is usually packed and incredibly LOUD, it sucks cause you can't really hear your own conversation..food is WAY WAY overhyped in my opinioni had the infamous pork belly pancakes.. maybe its cause im asian.. ive had MUCHMUCH better pork bellyit was tiny and very priceythe other times i went.. i dont even remember what i orderedso if that really says anythingi dont really care for their food and its way overpricedi do remember trying the french toast which was good at first (my friend ordered it) but quickly became too sweet and sickeningthis place is just not for mebut i will say its service is decentthe place is cute and has nice decor!but not worth my small wallet"
"I met two friends for a late 230 lunch on Friday afternoon. It was still quite packed at that time. Walk-ins first come first serve. Not sure how they section the restaurant but after we were seated it was at least a full 10 minutes before a server came to greet us. We shared:breakfast spaghetti 'n clams 'n crab - eggs . parmesan . pork guanciale . bok choy-fun dish... a sophisticated accident from late night college eating perhapsthe chickpea - kale . chopped veggies . mont amore cheese . tzatziki . chi vinaigrette .-citrusy and bitter. i particularly enjoyed the julienned lemon and falafel esq accompanimentcrisp shrimp 'cocktail' - somen noodle wrapped shrimp . cocktail sauce . lettuce wraps - eh... nothing is wrong with this dish but after sampling it i would rather save stomach space for something elseAfter lunch we had a drink upstairs. The FOOL'S RUSSIAN (Russian Standard Vodka, Fernet Leopold House-Made Cucumber Syrup Fresh Lemon Juice) was refreshing and surprisingly strong. Come if you have some time on your hands. Parking seems tough especially since they are doing construction in the area. 20 minute walk from Union Station."
"Food is great, but toooooo many people....."
"This place loves their kimchi and it's a good thing because so do I! We came here after high recommendations for brunch last weekend. We arrived around 9:30 AM on Sunday and had about a 45 minute wait so we decided to check out the bakery next door. While we were waiting, we decided to get a couple of onion rolls from the bakery to snack on. These were delicious and only $1.50 each - yum! We were seated and our waiter was very friendly and helpful. He was honest in what he liked and didn't like and gave reasonings to why (prefers sweet over savory for breakfast, etc). Our table ordered the reuben, asian breakfast tasty thing, and shrimp & grits. We were beyond impressed with the reuben. It is one of my favorite sandwiches and I'm not sure it's been done better than it is at The Little Goat. The addition of kimchi brought it to a whole new level. Incredible. Now that I'm back in Birmingham, I will continue to try to recreate this sandwich the way it was made here. I had no idea what to expect with the ""Kimchi, Eggs, Bacon, and Pancakes Asian Breakfast Tasty Thing"". I was hoping that it wasn't all separate and the waiter explained to me when I was ordering that it was all combined in pancake batter. This was packed with flavor and every bite was a little bit of a surprise - you never knew which ingredients you were going to get and how much of each. It was topped with sprouts which made it taste very fresh.The friend that got the Shrimp & Grits loved it as well.Overall - great price for delicious food. You can't go wrong here. If I had more of a sweet tooth, I'd definitely want to try the pancakes, waffles, etc. Can't wait to get back to Chicago just to eat at this place. Til then my dreams will be made of kimchi, corned beef, and rye bread..."
"We went for lunch.  We had a reservation but waited about 15-20 minutes before we were seated.  From watching the comings and goings I got the distinct impression that a reservation doesn't get you any advantage over a walk in -- they just seat you depending on when you enter the restaurant.I had the fried chicken, which was good (clearly fresh, never frozen) as far as plain fried chicken goes.  (I couldn't detect any spices/seasoning, which is why I say ""plain"")Wife had the sloppy goat, which she said was fine"
"As diners go this one is at the top. Comfortable, attractive venue with smiling, friendly staff. Breakfast and lunch are the go-to meals here. For the evening dining head directly across the street to highly acclaimed Girl and the Goat restaurant from the same chef owner."
"Little Goat Diner has been on my to-do list for a long time now so I was super excited when my mom and I decided we were going there for lunch last Wednesday.  Having been, all I can say is that you've goat to try this place. Ha.The openness of the restaurant and the light coming in from the windows was a pleasant reminder that sunshine and spring-time are just around the corner.  The mirrors made the restaurant feel airy and spacious. I loved the cute goat-themed details in everything from the logo on the plates to the adorable paper napkin ring.  Just being in this place makes you warm and fuzzy inside.Then the food puts you over the top.I chose the Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch Pancakes served with chocolate malt butter.  Holy goat.  I was celebrating National Pancake Day a day late and have had chocolate chip pancakes before but these quickly topped all previous expectations.  The bitterness of the dark chocolate chips was a nice compliment to the sweetness of the pancake batter. The crunch contrasted heavenly with the softness of the pancakes.  So delicious and filling that I had to take half of the order home as leftovers.My mom had the Sloppy Goat which is a sloppy joe ""gone goat"" topped with rosemary slaw upon a squish squash roll.  Still unclear was a squish squash roll is, but I got to try a bite and it was amazing!  The combination of goat meat and rosemary slaw was an interesting variation of the traditional sloppy joe and both my mom and I were impressed.  Overall, two great choices that we definitely recommend to anyone visiting the diner.I know understand why all of my friends are obsessed with Little Goat.  Great food, fun atmosphere and a fantastic location.  Loving all of the restaurants nearby and hopefully I'll get to try the sister restaurant, Girl and the Goat, sometime soon to compare.Happy eating everyone!Mary"
"Little Goat...the diner on steroidsSeriously test that billy for PEDs because Little Goat has a jam packed menu, bumping atmosphere, and deserts and drinks to wash it all down. I do not like to be unprepared so I carefully studied the menu for weeks before going however somehow was still dumbfounded as I read every word of the 4 page menu trying to highlight my options. Not all big menus work, but this big menu encourages you to come back and try something different. I had the Kalbi Beef Ribs. Flavor was 10 out of 10. I am torn on an overall rating because I expected  a short rib type plate but the meat came in small slivers and still on a very thinly sliced bone. It was a little inconvenient to eat with such small bones (I am sure I swallowed at least one) but after I Googled today, that is how Kalbi is served. I don't know if I can deduct points for my own ignorance but this dish would be at another level if it was short ribs and really tender boneless meat. The macho nachos and goat chili cheese fries which were a REALLY good for something that seems so simple and great finger food to share. Had the Moscow Goat as a beverage which was tasty but felt like it could have been ""done up"" more. I understand this is a diner, but it is a $15-$20 entree plate diner. Which leads me to my next point: our waiter was one of the least friendly I have had in Chicago. Every time he came to our table we appeared to be a hassle to him. Again, diner atmosphere (go to a Jersey diner and try to find a friendly waiter) and prices aren't too expensive, but also aren't diner prices so let's act like we give two hoots (or bahhhs). It was good and I will go back and probably bahmp it up a star to 4 but my socks are still on after round 1."
Best brunch of my life. Check it out.
"it is amazing. Make normal food special. The French toast has an egg inside, and it is very smooth in you mouth."
The food was definitely different from what I expected but it was good. I was there before Christmas and it was pretty busy during dinner time so service wasn't as quick but I would definitely go back for another fat club sandwhich!
my favorite thing was the chili cheese fries. i got the fish tostadas but they were hard to pick up / eat so i ended up just eating the contents and then the tostada part like chips. solid selection of beer and a comfortable level of noise!
"My burger was way overcooked. The server comp'd it and I ended up eating the bun and the toppings, which were pretty good. The burger patty was cooked beyond all recognition and even as a meat lover, I didn't want to eat it.I got the burger, ""Korean style"": the bun was flavorful and soft, the egg was cooked properly, and the other toppings such as kimchi went well except that the patty was overcooked. The smoked fries were tasty but oversalted. Oversalted is the theme of Little Goat and Girl & the Goat. Little Goat overcooked my burger and charged me for a full order of fries when I ordered a half order; the server didn't seem apologetic one bit. Perhaps the problem is that Little Goat has way too many menu offerings; they're like a Denny's - serving breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Another diner across from me sent his food back."
"I hadn't heard much of this place, given that it's sister restaurant, Girl and the Goat, gets most of the attention. But a friend made reservations here when a college friend came into the city to visit. It was a great choice!The good: the food was AMAZING. I ordered the tuna melt. Probably the best tuna melt I've ever had. The Mac and cheese side dish was good too, but not as exciting. The others around the table enjoyed their burgers, especially the Korean burger. I liked that the menu offered traditional diner options but with a twist. Service was also wonderful!The bad: it was a little loud. But, that's how diners go, right? Also, the server didn't really warn us about the portions. We asked how many sides to order (everything is a la carte).  She recommended 2-3 for 4 of us at the table. That was waaaay too much. The portions are large. But, once again, not huge complaint given that the leftovers were just as good!"
"Love this spot! I was even so bold as to try the pork belly toffee crunch milkshake.Yes this is a flavor spot so things may be a bit too salted but their whole vibe is fresh & peppy. I ate breakfast here once while around families and snoop dog was bumpin' on the speakers. What?Anyway, it's a more casual extension of Girl and the goat (which is exceptionally good.)"
"Tried the infamous waffle and fried chicken- I honestly thought it was okay... Nothing that was extraordinary.  However, I do really like their shrimp sandwich!! Bread is buttered up and perfectly baked. The shrimp is marinated in a spicy mayo cream sauce and the veggies give it the nice crunch. Ambiance of Little Goat is superb! Love the upstairs outdoor patio with lounge sofa's and tables. Their bloody mary's are delicious and packed with goodies. Not your fake bloody mary mix."
"Adjacent to the Little Goat Diner is the Alcove of Little Goat Bread and Coffee. The baked goods busines goes from 6am to 6pm though inside the space isalso the bar which has it's own menu and drinks till 2am. Thrre's also the Private Kitchen which is above eerything. Kind of interesting they basically have four busiess running out of one big building. Back to the bread, they habe all the baked goods for all their other businesses, and an order ahead program.  They also sell Stumptown coffee out of Portland and make great espresso drinks.  While we were waiting for our goods, chef Stephanie came from upstairs and stopped by the coffee bar for a few minutes, She's a petite one! I guess next time im inthe area, the Bar is the last of the group that i have to hit."
"Went for dinner last week, and it was stupendous: cute baby goat graphics everywhere, a surprisingly delicious caesar salad with little green beans and other fun stuff in it, great tap beer list, and our server (Gentleman with the glasses and a white watch, hello! You are great!) was SO nice to my 11-year-old son. Also, we made reservations for 7:30, arrived at 7:30 and actually got seated right away even though it was packed. Somehow that never happens. Little Goat is top of the list every time we return to Chicago now -- I really want to try that shrimp sandwich they serve on the bakery side."
"Overall a good brunch experience.  The service and ambiance were both good and my friend and I both really enjoyed our food!  I had the bulls eye french toast, which was delicious, and I can't remember what my friend ordered but he liked it a lot!  We had reservations during the week and had no trouble getting in, but I don't know how it would be on the weekend."
"I am literally drooling as I write this review.Los Drowned & Goat Chili were my favs. It's been awhile since I've been here, but I would try to go back to Chiacgo if only to eat at Little Goat again. Personally, I enjoyed it more than Stephanie's place across the street (Girl & the Goat). But I'm more into the casual dining and well done home cooked meals with bold flavors and no frills lately.Los Drowned: the best french dip I probably will ever have.Goat Chili: Interesting flavor. More citrus inspired. I love chili, I love citrus, I love crispies on top of said chili. The Best."
"It was good, but there was so much hype. Maybe it was because I only got a salad, but all in all - I wasn't that impressed. However, I did love the mac-n-cheese."
"Had lunch there a couple of weeks ago with a friend, have been meaning to write a review for a while. What can I say, great ambiance, good energy and buzz - even for lunch time in the middle of the week. I had their crab sandwich, which was on special, and it was mouthwatering delicious. The bun was almost like a crisp donut. I know they have this signature goat chili - I felt it was too vinegary and a bit sweeter than I like. Good, but not what i'd go back for. I would go back there for their brunch menu.I LOVE the fact that they have multiple outdoor seating - rooftop as well as a pretty big patio. And their lunch prices are so reasonable I'd love to go back there."
"I could sit here and rave about Little Goat for hours.  In fact, I probably have to my friends.  This is my favorite place in Chicago right now and has held that title for over a year.  Give me that corned beef hash as my last meal.  The wait can be painful but it's worth it.  My fridge is covered in photo booth photos.  Last time, I took my friend for the first time and she mentioned to our waiter about how all I do is rave about this place (I'm not kidding, I love Little Goat).  He went back to the kitchen and when he came back, he was with Stephanie and our orders!  Stephanie was incredibly sweet.  Even though I totally made a fool of myself by mentioning that they suddenly made the hash differently that day (telling you, I'm a freak for my hash).  Didn't matter what it looked like.  The taste is unwavering.  Some tips: Prepare to order your coffee/drinks the moment you sit down.  The lattes are divine.  They take the longest.  Order the corned beef hash.  Order whatever is on special that day.  Order anything that says it comes spicy.  You know what? Just try it all."
The Asian breakfast tasty pancake thingy is incredible. I essentially had a relationship with my food. It's kimchee+bacon+pancake+egg perfection. I was hesitant to finish my food because that would mean it would be over. God bless this diner and all its chefs and waiters and waitresses.
"I've been to Little Goat for breakfast three times.  The food was good each time, but not something I will ever do on a regular basis.  LG is absolutely worth checking out, and the menu is completely different than what most people are accustomed to.  The pork belly, corned beef hash and eggs were all outstanding.  The bloody mary was very weak last time I was there, which was a disappointment.  Service was average.Little Goat is good for when I have visitors in town.  Completely different menu options, and everyone I've taken, likes it."
"Overpriced. I get your affiliated with girl and the goat, but is there really a need to charge so much for a simple bagel? Wanted to get a dozen for the office to go in the morning and with tip it came out to be about $45.00."
Nicest staff in the city hands down. Food is awesome. The smoked pork and toffee milkshake still haunts me dreams. Omg it is amazing. They make all their own breads and pastries. Went for breakfast the other day and added a side biscuit for some carbs. I don't even like biscuits. I inhaled this one. It was buttery flakey perfection. Been her multiple times and always leave with a smile on my face and a happy stomach. Must go when in town!
"Fun, interesting food options.  I went there around 9:00am on a Saturday and actually had no wait!  The fat Elvis waffles were scrumptious, orange juice was good and hash browns were ok but not out of this world where I'd have to order them again.  The server was nice and attentive but probably fairly new as he seemed rather rehearsed on his script."
"The Los drowned sandwich with freshly baked bread was delicious, savory, refreshing and worth the time to write this review."
Wow! That's an amazing place! Just order anything from the menu and waiting to be surprised! And I would try the girl and the goat next time :)
The wait time was long but the food was pretty good!  I expected it to be a little better but my boyfriends meal was top notch. I got the gravy and biscuits and my boyfriend got the fat elvis. Service was okay but I only got one drink refill out of several table visits and the wait for the food was pretty long as well
"I love the Little Goat Diner. The dishes usually are not what I would expect, with how they look and the ingredients, but I always love them. I really enjoy that they take new spins on classics."
"Yum yum yummy yum yum!  Came here for lunch with 2 friends on a Monday afternoon.  It was busy, but not insane.  We didn't even have to wait for a table.  I ordered the mushroom, apple and cheddar quesadilla while my friends ordered the Fat club and Los something or other sandwich.  My quesadilla was DELISH and came with a healthy yogurt dipping sauce.  The brussel sprout salad it came with was so good too.  My friends sandwiches didn't come with any sides so they ordered a side order of fries, and it was large enough for them to share.  The price of the sandwiches were a little more than the average diner, especially because they didn't come with a side, but they were so tasty that it didn't matter.  And after our meal we went next door to get a homemade pop tart.....worth the calories for sure!  Can't wait to go back and try the breakfast!  Oh, and to take advantage of the rooftop in the summer :)"
"Stick with the Girl and the GoatI went here with a friend for dinner the other night and was disappointed, to say the least.Positives: our waitress was fabulous and the little goat coffee was delicious. In addition, we also had the cake of the day, which was a mix of chocolate and something and that was heaven in our mouths. Negatives: all the other food we had. We started out with the fried pickles and onion rings. They were disappointing -- ate two and left the rest. For the main course, I had the chickpea salad (blah) and my friend had the kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing.To say the least, it's name should be revoked -- it was not tasty at all!Next time, if we go back, I'm sticking to blueberry pancakes and shakes. Maybe I should have know better than to order a salad at a diner, even if it is an upscale diner."
"Note to anyone wanting to go here in the next few days and can't stand the heat:  their AC isn't strong enough to cool the restaurant down so expect to sweat!They did make up for this horrible oversight, and there is no way that this would stop from me going again... just call before you go to see if their AC problems are fixed.Anyway, this is my second time here and the food here is so fantastic especially for the price.  You can't beat a ridiculously tender flavorful piece of pork that melts in your mouth and is swimming in their house kimchi that is so jammed packed with flavor it would make you believe that you are ready to die and go to heaven because you just ate one of the the best things that you will ever taste in your life.  This of course is the Fork Pork Chop.  It is so good and it was the perfect serving..just enough to make me full.  My dad really liked his pork belly pancake and my mom loved her BLT with fresh Avocado.  They also have plenty of Vegan options which is great for my SIL.  Service was okay, but they are always busy, so you can't really expect white tablecloth service.  Wait wasn't too terrible for arriving for lunch at 11:00 - it was about 45 minutes.  It's nice that they text you when you're table is available so you can walk around on Randolph... when it's not during a heat wave!!  I can't wait to eat here again!"
"So happy I finally made it to the Little Goat Diner - it did not disappoint! Stephanie Izard was one of my favorites on Top Chef, and I've been meaning to make it here for a while. Our group of 3 arrived around 10:30am, just barely beating the Sunday brunch rush, and sat at one of the community tables. Parking was ample - and free because it was a Sunday :)Despite people waiting for tables, I never felt crowded or rushed during my meal. I feel that this is a problem with a lot of brunch places, and really appreciated the fact that I could focus on the food and the people that I was sharing the meal with. I went with the Blue Plate Dish which was a Cuban sandwich- amazing choice! With a nice staff, great food, great drinks and a greater atmosphere, I can't wait to come back here!"
"Our much anticipated first visit did not disappoint! Great food, service and atmosphere! There were 3 of us sharing one appetizer and 3 meals! Plenty of great food. Anxious to return and try some other options! I have my eye on a goat burger!"
I really like Little Goat!  I've been a few times and have loved every meal I've had - everything from the cinnamon roll to the the toastados. The servers are friendly and helpful in describing all the dishes.  I seem to bring all my out of town visitors here and they have all enjoyed their meals.  The Parathas Burrito is probably one of my favorite things.
"This place was adorable! I got in right before a rain storm and the glass ceiling provided a lovely view of the rain. The waitresses wear adorable, throwback outfits and there were a bunch of awesome veggie options.I ended up regretting my order, but only because I'm an idiot who didn't understand that the Fried Pickle Pita would, in fact, be covered in a gigantic mound of fried pickles. The description mentioned nothing about fried pickles, but it WAS named after them, so I thought at the most there would be a few thrown in. Alas, it was a mountain. I conquered Mt. Fried Pickle with a Few Onion Rings for Good Measure. By the time it was able to be eaten like a sandwich I was entirely full. But it was a delicious attempt at any rate. Would definitely come back and try some of the other interesting menu items and drink a delicious craft beer, while I'm at it. My friend had the bacon milkshake and lurved it, so go for it if you're considering it!"
Definitely a must try. Reservations need to be made a month in advance for decent times. Very eclectic menu but everything we tried was excellent.
"Came for lunch with a friend, lucky we were early and got seated right away.  Beautiful open space and huge menu.  Food was pretty good and has a ecletic mix of items to try.  Vefy nice staff, the place filled up quickly and yet we never felt rushed as we enjoyed our meal.  A good place to grab breakfast or lunch,  extensive menu, not amazing food, but enjoyable. Trip report on chiliandtart.tumblr.com"
"I'm a fan. Everything done right. Host and server friendly enough. Fast seating even for a crowded Wednesday lunch. At first glance the prices may seem a little steep ($10-$13 for a sandwich), but the portion sizes are very Midwest and one ""sammich"" as its called on the menu along with the fries is just right for two people. The fries are ""smokey"" fries and they are really outstanding - thin cut with the skin and a distinctive smokey flavor. I had half a Fat Club sandwich and it was superior - ham, turkey, bacon, avocado, sauce, etc...Located in a cool neighborhood with lots and lots of other newer wave Chicago dining places to explore.PS. Not that I'm pressing a point here, but it is worth mentioning that the men's bathroom was also spotless."
"I got the club sandwich and it was pretty good at first. However, when I finished the first half, I couldn't continue because their sauce just got too sweet and overwhelming. I'll go back again, but this time, I'll ask for their sauce on the side."
"It certainly is 'A-OK,' Yelp star-rating guide.I might take another star off just because there is so much hype about this place, but I don't know if that's how you're supposed to rate. Is it? Are you supposed to take into account the 'hype' factor (and thusly rate Subway higher if it's surprisingly enjoyable? :-))My boyfriend and I took the morning off from work for our 4-year anniversary, and we thought it would be a great opportunity to come here on a less-packed time. We got a seat right away, which was great.The service was very good, and the waitress was very pleasant and quick.The food is kind of expensive (around $14 for breakfast entrees). We splurged and split the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup to start, and that was very tasty ($13 I think).We each got our own entree, too. Boyfriend got an eggs n bacon n pancakes kimchi thing. I got Brandade and Belly, which had pork belly and eggs and a biscuit and also kimchi.I think mine tasted better, but it was also crazy-salty. I only ate half, and I was very thirsty and didn't feel super after (remember I ate half of another entree too!).And finally, the place was very cute, but this one hipster ruined the atmosphere a bit my trying to get 'money shots' with his iPhone camera...you know, kneeling and crouching and getting in the way of the waitstaff. Get a real camera, brah!But, overall, we were somewhat underwhelmed by our trip here. We've got many closer better brunch places that are also a bit cheaper."
"Great little place. The table split an app of fried pickles and onion rings, really enjoyed the mustard sauce with that. For a main course, I had the sloppy goat (and the table split an order of the smoked fries), which was amazing and I was stuffed silly by the end. Would happily come back any time I was in town."
"Delish! Went for a swearing in celebration and we all loved it (The cubano, the corned beef, the chili, the banana cake all amazing). The one flat note? The Parathas Burrito was  not great. The pita was good, the eggs were cooked PERFECTLY but the taste wasn't anything special. Random kidney beans? Barely there avocado? Orangey sort of spicy sauce? Say pass!"
"The more I come here, the more disappointed I get.  I think the only think I like about this place now is that they brew Stumptown coffee, which is the best cup I could find in the city so far.My most recent orders have been:Reuben- underwhelming, corned beef was dry and brittle.Chickpea salad- was a bit too acidic."
We've been here a couple of times and always received excellent service and delicious food. It's not typical diner food-more interesting. Best part is that we always got seated with no wait! Definitely worth checking out!
"I love Little Goat.  I loved it originally for lunch and dinner, but I love it about a hundred times more for brunch.  Something about the atmosphere just screams old fashioned breakfast diner, and when you add in the amazing goat milk lattes I could sit there all day.  We actually sat at the bar last time and it was great watching the kitchen in action.  The biscuits and gravy are a must try - different and better than the classic.  And if they happen to have the goat hot dog on special, DO IT.  It sells out fast, so don't pass it up.  Then menu is huge, so I'm sure I could go there a hundred times and not have everything, but I think I'd be willing to try!"
Meh... But I probably just ordered the wrong thing. Scallion pancake with pork belly. Did not like it.
"Words cannot describe this journey of flavors. We ate breakfast here. We also have come for dinner. We normally sit at the bar. We ordered the parathas burrito and the Spanish omelet. I was afraid the omelet would be boring or standard, but it wasn't. It had buttery, wet tortilla chips on it. There was a slight flavor of hazelnut that perfectly complimented the tomato sauce they were drenched in. It was a 6-egg omelet. The parathas burrito had a lovely texture. Each layer had a distinct flavor that aligned with each other layer. I preferred to add the hot sauces, and these homemade hot sauces made it bombastic. By the way, these aren't sauces with lingering painful spiciness. They were made with carefully-chosen combinations of fruits and peppers.The service is always friendly and attentive.  Good peeps."
"I'm kinda meh on this place. I've been here twice and both times was underwhelmed (I don't even recall what I had, and that's the point -- it isn't memorable).When I look at the menu, there's nothing that jumps out to me that looks super delicious. I find myself going back and forth between two or three options that aren't that great. And what's with putting kimchi on everything?! The hell? I expected something on par with Girl & the Goat, which I love. But this just wasn't too great. Long line/wait for little reward.For good diner fare, head a block east to Au Cheval."
"Was in Chicago visiting and so excited to be able to make it to Little Goat on a Monday for lunch, when the crowd was lighter. I made a reservation for my boyfriend and I and I'm so glad I did because even on a Monday afternoon this place filled up quickly.  We split the Sloppy Goat (our favorite of all the items we tried), the Goat Chili, Chickpea Salad with chicken, and fries.  Reason for the 4 rating was only because though I liked the salad it was a bit greasy from the falafel, and the goat chili, while unique, wasn't our favorite.  It was a cool atmosphere and was fun finally checking out a Stephanie Izard restaurant."
"Amazing. Not your typical diner. 20 minute wait for outdoor seating on a Saturday brunch time- not too shabby. The outdoors is great but the inside is big and beautiful for a diner. The food was so good my entire table was quiet eating for a solid 15 minutes just devouring their meals. Our drinks were yummy (I had the Moscow mule $11). Not too strong and delicious. My meal was the Brandade Pork Belly with eggs. Unbelievably good. I never thought I'd love mixing fish, pork and eggs and biscuit- but every piece was so delicious I ate every bite. Final bill with tip- $30 per person. Standard price for a high quality breakfast. I'll take all my visitors here."
"So after hearing about Little Goat 100 times... my husband and I finally decided to see what this place was all about. They don't take reservations... so there was a bit of wait (20 mins) which is fine because they have a bar there for those who want to drink.. and they also take your number and text you when your tables ready... so you can walk outside if you want to. This place reminds me of an upscale Denny's. The interior decorator did on amazing job on the decor. I loved the wallpaper and the chandelier in the middle. I also love the fact that I can go here any time of the day because they have breakfast, lunch, and dinner items on their menu and it's open 'till late!Now on to the food.. for our sides, we ordered goat chili cheese fries - AMAZING and mac and cheese, which was a bit disappointing, it was pretty bland... so didn't eat much of that. I ordered the burger, which was tasty.. and my husband ordered a roast beef sandwich and the spanish omelette.. he liked both and said it was the best omelette he's ever had! I've heard a lot about their  chicken and french toast.. so that's what I'm going to order the next time I go! Unfortunately, I ate too much and didn't have any room for dessert.. so hopefully next time... since I'm sure I'll be going back soon!"
"Someone described the decor as an ""80s TV show"" and I totally get it.  The good news is that I didn't mind it a bit.   It works for the place and is a nice contrast to the Girl & the Goat's look.  I showed up around 10 am and started off with a mimosa from their ""Hair of the Goat"" drink menu.  I don't love mimosas usually because they are fizzy, but this one was infused with cucumber, watermelon, and blueberry.  It was so refreshing that I ended up having two.   The highlight for sure, though, was the bull's eye french toast.   This masterpiece was made with two thick slices of sweet onion brioche.  Each contained an egg - toad in the hole style.  The eggs were just under hard cooked, which may or may not have been intended, but I loved it.  The whole thing was then topped with fresh strawberries, bits of crispy fried, chicken, and the perfect amount of bbq maple syrup.   I'm a syrup dipper and don't like soggy or overly sweet french toast -- this was neither.   The meal ended up being sort of expensive - $16 for the breakfast and $9 each for the mimosas.  I happily paid it.   I also tipped well since the server was excellent.  Bright and bubbly and attentive without being obnoxious - exactly what I would have imagined from an upscale diner.  Things to know:   - There will probably be a wait.  It's totally worth it.   - They have some communal tables, so be sure to say so if that's not your thing.  - They serve their whole menu all day.  Dinner for breakfast or breakfast for dinner - you can get it here."
What a cute little cafe. We stopped in to buy souvenirs but did not eat. I enjoyed the atmosphere and would like to go try out the food!
Los drowned (4 Stars)Fish tostadas (4)Blueberry pancakes (3+)Mac n' Cheese (4)Crisp shrimp 'cocktail ' (4+)Very solid tasty food with great service.
"I came in with very high expectations of LIttle Goat given all the hype, and I did not leave disappointed. It was indeed delicious. We ordered the pork belly pancake, Bull's eye french toast, and a side of brussel sprouts to share and everything was very thoughtfully made. The craftsmanship in the dishes is actually quite stunning: there were two perfectly cooked eggs embedded within the french toast, which totally took me by surprise as I was cutting into it. The pork belly pancake was also very good; they were a little skimpy on the pork belly and a little too generous on the asian slaw, but still very good nonetheless. I think it's quite reasonably priced for a celebrity chef joint, definitely worth trying at least once."
"We love Girl and the Goat since it first opened its doors. Little Goat, however, is GATG without the refinement and thoughtfulness that make Stephanie Izard so phenomenal.It's definitely passable diner-fare, don't get me wrong. The portions are ample and the menu is extensive. But some things just don't work for simply ""passable"" food, such as: The long wait times, the bourgeois drink prices, the haphazard Korean influence. We have tried Little Goat a few times, hoping for a four or five star experience, and have left disappointed with each visit."
"This is the place for goat lovers! Goat chocolate milkGoat gelatoGoat chili fries OMGoat!!!Bulls Eye French Toast's chicken is fantastic....watch out chicken and waffles, chicken and french toast is now here!!Hot Crab Dip sure is cheesy, but I only got 2 lumps of crab :(Blueberry pie is fantastic, as is Choco Taco sundae (sour cream ice cream!!)Grab a drink at the rooftop bar upstairs while you're waiting for an outdoor table at Little Goat :)"
"How a place can be so amazing, I do not know. But Little Goat knows what's up, and it's certainly worth the wait.While their main entree menu will outright blow your mind, I prefer swinging by their cafe and deli on the side of the restaurant, grabbing a quick sandwich and latte, and hanging out on their awesome rooftop deck surveying all the bustling that is Randolph Street.If there's one thing that'll make me return to Chicago, this place is it."
"They have an interesting concept, lots of unique dishes you won't see at other restaurants. I had the bull's eye french toast which was great, my wife had the spaghetti and clams which was pretty good. Little goat latte was flavorful but kinda heavy. Pork and toffee shake was a bit expensive but worth trying. Our waiter was very courteous and attentive. The wait can get pretty long so plan ahead, especially on weekends."
"The only... and I mean ONLY... thing I do NOT like about Little Goat is how long the wait is if you show up after 6pm just about any day of the week.  They don't take reservations on purpose since it's supposed to be a much more laid back, inclusive, anyone-can-eat-here kind of little sister to Girl & the Goat across the street, so play smart, people.  Go at an off time.  Like 4pm.  On a Saturday.  Sure, you won't be the coolest kid on the block, but you know what?  You won't have to wait for a table for more than ~10 minutes *AND* you'll be able to eat enough food for both lunch AND dinner AAAAND add in a dessert.  Because it's early enough to walk it off afterwards.  And their desserts are AMAZING.  Especially the blood orange meringue pie.  AHHHHHHHH... I want to go to there...Anyway, this place is seriously awesome.  Super fun interior (like Alice and Wonderland meets iHop which somehow resulted in a hip and trendy diner... random, but it totally works), great staff with excellent recommendations (which you should ask for and take b/c they have never steered us wrong before!), and INCREDIBLE food in portions big enough to feed a small village without the price tag you'd expect from a place this popular.Can't really go wrong, but a few of my favorites:- LOS DROWNED (braised beef, avocado, butterkase cheese, pickled peppers 'n onions, spicy mayo, hoagie): I feel like I don't have to describe this beyond the list of ingredients.  It's HUGE.  And filling.  And amazing.  And drowned.- GOAT CHILI CHEESE FRIES: I'm not totally sure what goes on these exactly, but whatever it is, it's INCREDIBLE.  It's like a creamy, cheesy, meaty party on a bunch of deliciously perfect french fries sure to spoil everyone's dinner.  Well, until your meal comes out and is so amazing you eat it anyway.- MACHOS NACHOS (corn tortillas cooked to flippin' perfection, bbq pork, beans, pickled peppers, cheddar, sour cream, avocado): will RUIN all other nachos for you.  They're so, SO good... and HUGE!  Not sure why they're under the snack section b/c these have served as a meal and then some for me multiple times.- And did I mention that BLOOD ORANGE MERINGUE???  Pretty sure I did.  But just in case, there you have it.  Get it.  It's phenoms.So if you want to be super cool and hipstery, hit this place up in your skinny jeans on a Friday night and be prepared to wait 2 hours for a table.  But if you don't care about other people actually seeing how cool you are by going to this restaurant, seriously go at an off time and have one of the best meals of your LIFE without a significant wait.  Mark my words -- you WILL be back.  And I will be jealous.  Guaranteed. ;]"
"I had eaten at Stephanie Izard's first restaurant, The Girl & the Goat, three times and have been impressed each time. I finally had an opportunity to try its offspring, Little Goat Diner. I made 7pm reservations through OpenTable but had to wait until 7:20 to be seated due to how busy it was on a Tuesday evening. I have absolutely no issue with that, not at all, especially since sincere effort was made to confirm they had my cell phone number to contact me when a table became available.The food was hearty and tasty. Started with the Macho Nachos - more than enough for two hungry guys like us.My partner had the Patty Melt. I had the Goat Almighty. Bumped-up comfort food that is filling and worth coming for!I would happily give Ms. Izard's casual eatery a spectacular 5 stars rating but have to subtract 1 to 1-1/2 stars due to our waiter Wally who tainted an otherwise satisfying evening at Little Goat.We had ordered diet cokes. We are admittedly fast consumers of diet coke but not demanding or impatient at all. I am not a regular diet coke drinker in the first place (although my partner is). But after nachos and meaty dinners, our thirst does need to be quenched. On our request for a 3rd refill of diet coke (occurring about an hour after being seated), Wally the waiter said quite sternly, ""You guys need to slow down, OK?""Note: Our glasses of water were never refilled. Not once. The attitude Wally had with our request for a refill was unnecessary, in our opinion. If we had ordered blander dishes, we'd likely order less colas, but we'd still be thirsty since our water supply for that hour was just one glass' worth.While the food and front service excelled, Wally's comment and his tone toward these two customers cost Stephanie Izard a deservedly perfect 5-star rating. Instead, The Little Goat will have to embarrassingly bleat for an imperfect 3-1/2 to 4-star rating tonight."
"I'm stingy with 5-star reviews but after my third visit today, factoring in price plus quality, Little Goat fits the bill of as good as it gets.My first visit I had: a cocktail (can't remember the name, sorry!), bull's eye French toast, mac and cheese, and biscuits on the side. The biscuits were a little crunchy for my tastes but everything else was excellent and perfectly cooked.Second visit: more mac and cheese and the sloppy goat.  A quick word about the sandwich, my first bite was of the goat alone and it was a little salty.  I was concerned.  But, when I ate the sandwich altogether (with bread and coleslaw), it was pretty much perfect.  I dream about this sandwich.  (Note, we also had the banana spilt and it was delicious).Third visit: even more mac and cheese and the goat kimchi burger.  It took a lot of willpower not to get the sloppy goat and/or French toast but given how large the menu is, I thought I should branch out.  I'm so happy I did!  The burger was as amazing as the other things I've eaten.Bottom line, eat at Little Goat."
"My sister was visiting from Portland, so I took her here, and she absolutely loved it. We had the hot crab dip, bulls eye french toast, sloppy goat, los drowned, and watermelon mimosas. The bulls eye french toast was the favorite. Since we came for brunch on a Saturday, there was a long wait, about 45 minutes, but we just hung out on the rooftop. I actually enjoyed the wait, since it was so nice and hot out, and the vibe on the rooftop was pretty cool, with good music!Service was great, the server made good recommendations, and comped us fries for the long wait.I would def. recommend this place to others."
One of the best diners and breakfast I have eaten. Very nice decor and excellent waitresses.  Visited several times for breakfast and recommend arriving before 9 if party larger than 2.  Either way worth the 20-30 minute wait on a weekend morning.
"The heat and stuggling A/C (they actually brought in portable units to help cool down the room) could not stop my girlfriend and I from devouring mass quantities of delicious vittles.  Definitely check out the goat chili cheese fries.  Rich, hearty and ridiculously addictive.  I went with the Bull's Eye French Toast while she opted for the Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch pancakes.  Looking back , we could have easily split one of the dishes are they run fairly large.  Of the two, I like my selection a bit more (I opt for more savory vs. sweet dishes).  The french toast was accompanied with an egg, strawberries and some of the best fried chicken I have tried all covered by a bbq maple syrup.  Yes-strange ingredient bedfellows but it definitely worked!We left ridiculously full but would stop again in a heartbeat when we are back in town."
"Stopped in here on a Chicago burger hunt.  The place around the corner was suffering a 1.5 hour wait due to a hipster infestation, and I didn't even know The Little Goat was next to it.  Place was on my list so here we gooooooooo.First off, this place kinda intimidated me.  It's really cool.  But a comfortable cool.  The staff looked like they could tell I am way not cool. (no matter what my mom says) Turns out the staff is really nice, no comments about how not cool I am.  Really helpful.  One of the highlights for me (besides the food) was the sound track being played.  How often do you eat at a restaurant and get to hear ""I left my wallet in El Segundo"" by Tribe Called Quest?  Just makes everything taste better.Food consumed this night were (was?) onion rings and fried pickles, smoked fries, mac and cheese, macho nachos, pulled pork sandwich, and the patty melt.  No I was not alone.  I came for the burger.  The patty melt was great.  The beef was cooked perfectly and seasoned great.  Cooked medium in every bite.  Did not disappoint. I travel to Chicago pretty regularly and have had many of the cities so called best burgers.  This is pretty high up on my list now.  All the sides were good.  Fries were pretty good, not outstanding.  Mac and cheese was really good.  Nachos were much better then average.  The fried pickles and onion rings were really really good.  I have never had such a sweet tasting onion ring.  Once the ring was dipped in the curried mustard....WOW.  Also had a few of the menu cocktails. These were good too.Go here.  Don't wait.  It's really good.  My issue now is that I have to get back Chicago to come here for breakfast.  The omelette's that the kitchen was pumping out looked amazing."
Great place ... Has a very hip upscale dinner feel ..great vibe..very nice staff ... Great decor .. The food yummy .... My girl got the special which was beef stroganoff and I got the spiced apple pancakes and a side order of fried chicken with a biscuit .. The fried chicken was a little greasy but still good .. I'm coming back in the next month to try more off there menu ... Congrats to this place .. Chicago needs more spots doing different stuff .. Thanks little goat
"I love you Stephanie Izard! You are truly a master of cooking. You've changed the game and have fun being you. The menu here is a take on diner foods taking to another level. With an awesome playlist of music playing you can't help but sing along. 90s-Early 2000s songs of hip hop, pop, and dance. Little Goat breaths fresh air into the culinary world.We ordered so many dishes here. The PB&J waffes, fried chicken french toast, mac and cheese, Sloppy Joe Goat, and Biscuits and gravy. Everything had a new taste to it. A definite mind f*ck. Going to the Little Goat you should try a little bit of everything. I haven't had breakfast like this before and glad I made it here. Any restaurant that Stephanie opens.. I'll be there!"
"Awesome place for a good snack.  Stopped in on a Sunday night and put our name on the list then headed to the roof top bar. Had a drink at the bar upstairs and really enjoyed the scenery and the views from the roof top. Pretty cool use of the space!After we got our seat we ordered some sides to share, the Mac N Cheese and the Fries. Fries were pretty good! Not the best ever, but a good fry. The Mac n Chee was disappointing. Really expected more. The texture was off on the cheese sauce and the noodles were too soft. Made you want to wipe your tongue off with your napkin, but apparently they frown upon that in this establishment.I ordered the Patty Melt, medium. Also pretty disappointing. I would rather of had one from Waffle House. The bread was good, grilled nicely. The meat was under seasoned and shaped like a softball. That it probably why the whole of the inside of it was raw and cold. It had not yet reached ""rare"" This sucker was still wiggling. The other problem with the shape of the ""patty/ball"" was that it sat in the center of the bread and you had to take 3 big bites from the side before you ever hit meat. Picture two frisbees with a baseball in the middle. That's what I had. But it was buttered. So... Buttered frisbees. My buddy had the Pancakes. THAT is what I should have got!!!  Those were some great pancakes! And I think the fries, service, and these pancakes are what's keeping me from dropping the review another star. I can't wait to make it across the street to try to flagship of this restaurant group. If I come to Little Goat again, it will be for breffasses and nothin else."
Good diner food and made for a good brunch spot.  Huge crowds and a lengthy wait are the drawbacks on a Sunday morning.  I had the corned beef hash which was excellent.  Really enjoyed the grilled hash browns on the side.  I'd like to come back and try the lunch items but will try to time it for an off hour.
"Stopped here for lunch today and had 3 delicious sandwiches. Roast beef, shrimp po boy, and tuna. All distinct and all very tasty. My favorite was the roast beef. Can't go wrong with any of them."
"Date night with the hubby at the Little Goat.  Because he likes diners and I like good quality food (NOT greasy spoon food).The hubs went with the beef burger made wing style.  Wing sauce, blue cheese & celery topped with crispy string onions on fat potato bun.  It's served ala carte so that's all there was; a burger, no fries.  The man was a little bummed bout fries being extra.  While there's a lot of diner vibe reverberating in the atmosphere, diner prices is not one of them.I had the fried pickle ""sandwich"".  It was served open-faced; the bread was naan and it was topped with hummus, tzatziki,  goat cheese, roasted peppers, kale and fried pickles of course.  WTF!?!?  Whoever came up with this sandwich was either drunk or pregnant...but hopefully not at the same time.  I simply had to try it because there was a whole lotta whack going on and I wanted a bite.  If I'm eating out I like to try something new and something I'll never be able to make myself at home.  It was all kinds of whhhat in my mouth; crunchy fried pickles contrasting creamy sauces, tangy vinegar flavors and smooth savory sauces.  My taste buds were all cray cray trying to figure out what was coming down the flavor palette next.  It was chaos.  It wasn't bad but it was crave worthy goOOod.  It would be better as an appetizer to share so everyone get confused trying it."
few of my friends recommended this place so decided to come here.. the service was good.. the place look pretty modern and clean.. the service was decent..ordered the..Hot Crab Dip- which is creamy cheesy lump crab with Ritz crackers.. the dip itself is pretty salty and i think it was just eh.. make sure to ask your waitress for more ritz crackers since its free refills on the ritz!goat almighty- braised beef . bbq pork . pickled jalapenos . salsa verde . onion rings . cheddar ..  looks crazy.. and is big! lol but it was average.. i asked for medium rare and it came out well done.. the meat wasn't well season also.. it was just a big average cool looking burger hahaalso sampled my friends food.. the los drowned and pork bell pan cake.. both was tasted ok.. nothing to b wow about..probably come back and give it another try when ever im around ..
"Dear Stephanie - marry me. Circle yes or no. Girl, you can throw down some good food! I was saving my maiden Goat voyage for a visit from some fellow San Francisco foodies of mine. It was number one on our food adventure list. And we were not disappointed. It's a diner, it's not fancy Girl & the Goat from across the street - my wife's, er I mean, Stephanie's higher end venture. So get over your snobby self and tuck in for some way the hell above average diner food, food. My table ordered the Bull's eye french toast (think fancy fried chicken and waffles), the pork belly pancake (think Asian fusion taco), the shrimp sandwich on fresh baked bread from the connected bakery (think mouth-gasm) and for the table we split the smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake - that's right, I said it, smoked pork in ice cream. When the waitress asked if we wanted a shot of bourbon in it, the table answered in unison by saying, ""duh."" :) It's rich, very rich - it took 3 of us to work our way through it, but after each first sip (and until a pork chunk got stuck in the straw) we offered a moment of silence. It's blow your mind good. All of it, everything we ate was blow your mind good. It is hands down the best food I have had in Chicago so far. The place is huge. Main dining area, an upstairs, outdoor patio and connected bakery/coffee shop with a window to watch the bakers at their craft and if you have tried the bread there you know it's masterful. So so so good. This foodie and my fellow foodies were impressed. And I will be taking more people there (as an excuse to work my own way through the menu). well done honey, er Stephanie :)"
"We've now been here twice and the jury is honestly still out.  Both times were for brunch, and so far the only thing I can say I REALLY enjoyed is the cheesy grits.  They are delicious!In the two visits we have had the chocolate pancakes, the brandade and belly, the crab and clam scramble thing and the flatbread burrito thing.One thing I will say is that the dishes are certainly not your run of the mill options.  I did enjoy the brandade and belly which is kind of a pork belly and kimchee eggs benedict sort of thing.  The ingredients all seem very fresh, it's more that the combination of flavors doesn't do it for me.The chocolate pancakes were just ok, which was kind of dissapointing.  The chocolate spread was kind of a nice touch but overall they were very dry-ish.  I feel like maybe we should have gone with the Elvis waffle.I love the atmosphere of the restaurant and really want to like it since most people I know who have been here rave about the place.  I'm sure we'll be back, if only to order 20 pounds of cheesy grits.  yum!"
"Wonderful! Both of us ordered the spiced apple pancakes. They were stuffed with  sliced fresh apples, not the typical  canned syrupy stuff. The bacon was great.  The coffee was really good but the hot chocolate even better. Our waiter was really attentive. The Goat is usually packed (it's family/kid friendly) so I recommend reservations...which they honor with on- time seating."
After many attempts to come here on a weekend I finally made it on a monday.  The place was full but there wasn't a wait.  I had the sourdough pancakes they were pretty thick and very filling. The sourdough wasn't overwhelming and there was a slight sweetness. The maple sausage had good flavor but they were visually unappealing very short and fat. The hashbrowns were good just wish they had onions
We eat here every time we come to Chicago.  Love the food and the atmosphere.
"Me & my peeps were hungry after some serious hours of drinking and then we realized a friend of ours worked @ Little Goat as we were already down the street @ that dreaded Market.  We walked in and were greeted by the nice staff and shown to our seats immediately. This place is basically a diner to say the least, but its definitely a break from the swanky restaurant/bar scene on this strip.Everybody's dish looked pretty good as I got the Biscuits & Gravy along with a side of chicken tenders (Nick M decided to share ""plates"" with me). The chicken tenders were very crispy and delicious, but the biscuits & gravy definitely hit the spot. The gravy was very tasty and rich as the biscuits were quite fluffy while covered in creamy goodness. Eventhough there are other goodies on the menu, I would love to get this again. The bloody mary is pretty decent as well.Since our pal worked there we got a nice tour of the kitchen and met some cool peeps that work in the back. Little Goat definitely is a good spot to dine in.I came back again and tried the Cuban Sandwich and it was amazing! The best I've had outside of Miami! We also tried the Goat chili cheese fries and they were nothing short of delicious! Me & my bosses wanted more & more...love this place!"
"Second time I've been here and just as blown away as the first. The food was incredible, our server Camille was lovely and the experience overall was great. My aunt was in town from NC so to give her the chance to experience this type of dining made me look like a great host!"
"After a two hour road trip for a meeting turned into a 12 hour extravaganza due to closed highways and detours from hell all due to nasty, nasty rains and flooding- we needed some decent food.  AND that is where Little Goat came into the picture. Cheesy, gooey,Ritz cracker crab dip (that just made me laugh in the 50s serving dish) hit the spot as a starter.Tempura Mashed Potatoes livened up the scene.  I went with the Reuben.  I love the reuben as a no fail sandwich and feel like you can never go wrong.  The Kim chi inside the sandwich threw me for a loop, but all was well. I totally dug the extra crunch and spice it gave this traditional sandwich!  It also all tasted great for leftovers the next day (I was a bit worried about this- no problems).One of my dinning partners went for the beef heart gyros.  It was amazing.  It had white and green asparagus and was all just perfect! The other had the horseshoe. It was his second time around with that dish and he swears by it!  I took a bite and totally get his delight!The food was pretty good.  The music was loud, a bit loud, I actually practiced my lip reading skills.  The waitress was friendly and helpful.  Unfortunately, she accidentally switched my friends credit card.  It quite cramped his weekend.  All in all, things were good.  Better than your average diner, not as great as the goat.  I think this is exactly what they are going for!  Enjoy!"
"Ho-lee-cow! This place serves up one hell of a meal. Stopped in for lunch with coworkers, immediately got a table, and ate more food than I care to admit. We all tried a little bit of eachother's dishes and nothing disappointed. The scallion pancake with pork belly was killer, and then goat chili cheese fries were gone in an instant."
"Quite disappointing.Pork sandwich, with a large piece of breaded pork that had been pounded and pounded until it was a tough piece of tasteless chewiness.  My wife is an expert on pork, and she thought it was terrible.  Limited wine selection overpriced.  A dish they call Boo Boo Baise which is an insult to the concept of bouillabaisse, in content, in taste, and in presentation.  Smoked fries were ok, not special.Great setting, marginal service, mix-mash of foods that really didn't sound that appealing.  We'll go back to try breakfast, but for lunch or dinner, not again.  A perfect example of a restaurant living on the hype of its overextended one-time-wonder chef.  We loved her at Scylla, but not since."
"I made a reservation using Yelp a week before, which worked like a charm! Since I had early reservations at 4:30pm, we found free parking a block away.The wait time was probably 2 minutes when we got there. The deco inside is just absolutely amazing. It's a very modernized dining look. None of that tacky 1950's dining era. Our waitress was very nice and helpful, and never had an issue with her at all. I didn't order any drinks, but we got the fried pickles and onions for appetizers. I am a huge fan of their fried pickles! I ended up getting a caesar salad. Their golden beets inside the salad was probably my favorite part. Since I was there for a bachelorette party, we had brought our own cake to celebrate, and our waitress didn't mind at all to bring us extra plates and forks to eat it.I would suggest going here if you want to experience a good diner experience but in a way more classy experience."
"This place is pretty hip and the menu is very unique - goat meat, pork belly milkshakes, smoked fries, peanutbutter waffle. Some of the combinations sound a little crazy but are undoubtedly appetizing. We ordered the smoked fries which I'm pretty sure were fried in goat fat or duck fat. I got the fish tostadas which were mediocre. My friend got peanutbutter banana waffles with a giant dollop of peanut butter butter, pretty delicious and my other friend got the goat burger. We were absolutely stuffed by the end."
"My friends and I went to Little Goat with a group of 6.  Smushed into a booth, I was excited to experience Chef Izard's brainchild.  The atmosphere was good, our server (Camille) was amazing (seriously - she was super attentive even though the place was busy), and everyone at the table was having a good time.We started off with drinks and an order of the Fried Pickles & Onion Rings and the Machos Nachos (at Camille's recommendation).  The nachos were amazing.  AMAZING.  I could probably wax poetic about the nachos alone.  Seriously. Leave me in a room with the nachos and only one of us is getting out of their alive.  They were amazing.I decided to order the crab omelette, the special of the night, and some hash browns.  Unfortunately, I was less than impressed.  The Omelette was lacking ANY kind of crab flavor and the hash browns were overwhelmed with goat cheese.   I did try a bite of my friend's Pork Belly Pancake and fell in love.  The flavors are amazing and you're getting a ton of deliciousness for what you're paying.I would consider returning to try something else, probably something that's a bit more popular or recommended by the server."
"Lives up to its hype! This is a mix of modern and 50s-themed diner. I came here with a party of 4 on a Sunday night. We had the choice of immediately sitting at the open table or waiting 30 minutes for our own table. We were all hungry, so we opted for the open table! Our server came soon after we were seated. He recommended a few dishes and was overall extremely helpful in navigating the enormous menu for me. It was a hard decision, but I finally chose the pork belly pancake because pork belly and scallion pancakes are my favsies! :) It didn't take long for the food to arrive (~15 minutes). I was really surprised by the ginormous amount of food that came on my plate! There was one scallion pancake on the bottom topped with 2 slices of pork belly and a freakin MOUNTAIN of cole slaw. The cole slow was lightly flavored and perfect to taste. The pork belly, unfortunately, was a bit too salty for me :( But it was still tender and yummy! The scallion pancake is just like how my mama makes it! It has multiple layers of crispiness :)"
"Carl (Karl?) is the bestest! The food & cocktails were great, too :) So tired of crappy brunch places. This was the brunch of my dreams!"
Been here 3 times can recommend the bullseye french toast from previous visit.  Today I had the best meal I have had here.  The smoked corned beef hash is a killer dish.  The corned beef is thinly sliced and shredded mixed with some diced onions and shredded potatoes.  Great flavor on the beef and the potatoes are fried extra crispy.  The dish may be a little heavy on the oil because it is cooked on the grill but that just adds to the flavor.  Makes me sorry I wasn't nursing a hangover but don't think I would have enjoyed it as much if I was.The place is loud so don't expect a quiet conversation.
"This is easily one of the best breakfasts I've had in a long time.  And, not only the best, but also fun, and creative, with amazing service at decent prices, and a menu that I'd like to return to at least 5 times.  Sadly, I don't live in Chicago, but you can bet every time I go back (which will hopefully be often) I will go back here.First off, the menu is amazing.  TONS of choices, all more delectable than the next.  It's totally indulgent, creative comfort food with a heavy emphasis on pork and goat's milk, so be prepared.It was brunch time, so I ended up ordering breakfast and my friends ordered off the lunch menu.  Here's what was ingested:-The Little Goat, which is an awesome, but small, espresso latte/chai latte with some interesting spices and goat's milk cream.  It's sweet, and satisfying, but not big enough.-The Bull's Eye French Toast - oh holy shit.  Aside from one of my two eggs being overcooked, this was essentially my absolutely ideal breakfast on a plate.  It's PERFECT for those who can never decide between sweet and savory.  Look up what it is on their menu page - you will die - and it's as good as you think it will be.  And it's HUGE.  I will dream about this dish.-Broccoli & Cheese Puff - well-cooked (aka over cooked, but I like it that way!) broccoli with cheesey sauce that isn't mind blowing, until you have a bite of it with the cheese puff.  It didn't last long on our table.-The Burger - my friend had it.   She seemed to like it.  Halfway through she said ""Ugh I'm so full"" and then 5 minutes later it was gone.-The Smoked Fries - they're thin, slightly stringy fries, but they have nice flavor, are crunchtastic, and are perfect for dipping in their hot sauces.-Pork Belly Pancake - easily one of the best bites of asian-inspired food I've ever put in my mouth.  If this dish was in Boston I would eat it at LEAST once/week.  It's absolutely stunning to the taste buds.Also I really wanted to try their Ooey Gooey Cinnamon Bun, but I was so full I couldn't bring myself to get one while I was there.  Instead I popped over to Little Goat Bread to get one to go, and also fell victim to buying a Banana Espresso muffin too.  Haven't tried the latter yet, but the Cinnamon Bun is tasty, yet unimpressive.  My guess is that when you order it in the restaurant and it's actually Ooey and Gooey it's pretty flippin' fantastic.So, in an ideal world, this restaurant would be 2 minutes from my house back in Boston, but sadly it's hundreds of miles away instead.  Boo.  Stephanie - please come to the east coast??"
"After quite the evening of drinking a few friends of mine and myself needed some food. While working towards Halsted to catch a cab we saw Little Goat still opened and decided to go in. I love that this place is a ""diner' because it looks like anything but a diner. It has a really nice crisp design and a lot of attention to detail. The menu is huge but not your typical diner food. Our waiter came to say hi right away. I wish I remembered his name (see the first few words of the review as to why I didn't) because I'd love to give him credit for being awesome!! I was relatively clueless and my attention span was very low. I was going to just get lots of water and coffee with some food but someone the waiter got me all pumped up about a Blueberry Mimosa. Well he was right and it was awesome! Now for the amazingness. Another suggestion from our waiter. I love french toast so he suggested the Bull's Eye French Toast. There is this delicious bread with a runny egg in the inside. YUM. There is also crispy chicken on the top and a bbq maple syrup. It was just absolutely delicious. I cannot wait to have it again. One of the guys in the group knew one of the butchers so we got a really cool behind the scenes tour downstairs. I love seeing things like that. The way they make food here is very legit! Lots of cool cooking tools...no idea what they were called. I can't cook ha."
"I would rate this a four 1/2 out of five. The portions were very generously and decently priced. The rating for the price is accurate at $$. The food was super tasty and flavorful! I had the all American burger and tempura mashed potatoes, my date had the taco salad with goat meat, and we shared the crab dip. It was great! The ambiance and the wait staff was awesome too. A classic diner feel and very friendly staff. All around a great time!"
"this was a repeat breakfast visit to little goat and this time things were just off.  we did not have to wait for a table which was nice, the server was friendly and there as we got settled. Then it started to go sour. the server began to disappear, coffee arrived with cream but no spoons. We asked for spoons and received spoons large enough to ladle gravy from a tureen. Then one of our food items arrived which we were going to share. We asked for sharing plates and received bowls. so we managed. One of our food items was the elvis waffle which was very good. another was hash browns which were kind of glued together into a big blob except at the edges which were crispy. eggs and toast were as good as expected. Considering the difficulty of getting to the restaurant and it only being mediocre, it might be a while before i venture back there."
"This place was perfect for my husband and my 5 year old son. Kid friendly, so I don't feel badly if my child is louder than necessary. Food was fab, friendly service. Check it out!I didn't give 5 stars because parking can be difficult. I try to avoid valet if possible."
"Little Goat lived up to my very high expectations - every single thing was absolutely delicious. I would eat here every day if I/my pants could. We went at 11 on a Saturday and only waited about 30 minutes, which was way less than I was anticipating. You can wait in Little Goat Bread which is spacious, has a nice bar and excellent coffee. My table got the Korean Burger, Sloppy Goat, the Reuben and the smoke fries. The fries are huge - definitely enough for 4 people. Everything was incredible. The ""squish squash bread"" that the burger & sloppy goat come on is so good too - crunchy on the outside and sweet/potatoey inside."
"Wonderful flavors and good service. All four entrees for dinner were delicious and hard to come up with enough adjectives:  killer blue plate special shepherds pie like goat stew, goat patty melt, many flavors tuna melt (proclaimed best ever) and perfect fish tacos on crisp tostadas with avocado, slaw and chickpeas. All very reasonable prices.  Had the shrimp on lettuce wrap appetizer which was also perfect but not cheap (5 for $15).  Lively atmosphere and excellent mix on the draft beer selections. Arrived at about 530 on Sunday holiday weekend and had to wait about 35 minutes in the bar but got seated immediately when we got the you're next call."
Disappointed  order corn beef hash this morning and it came swimming in grease.13.00 and no toast .. So i ordered 2.00  toast. Cold and nothin special coffee very strong .. They ration the trevia packets got 1.   Really   This ones a drive by
"Little Goat is delicious! I went with my cousins last night and we conveniently got a table right away. We arrived just before the dinner rush so it was perfect timing.Our waitress was very sweet and informative. She told us about the goat based onion soup, and I being an avid onion soup eater, had to get it. It was one of THE BEST onion soups I have ever had....and I have a personal rule where if there is onion soup on the menu, I absolutely have to try it. It was SO GOOD. Seriously people, try it.We also ordered the crab dip which was pleasantly paired with buttery ritz crackers. My cousin ordered the pork belly pancake, I tried a bite and was happy with the tasty result. I ordered a veggie patty with the mushroom burger toppings- it was good! I also ordered a beverage, the Ol' Blue, it was a little sweet for me but was still exceptionally well made. I enjoyed it.  Overall I had a great experience here, and will be returning in the future."
"I really wanted to give this place five stars, but again the service made it impossible to do so.  Other than our rude waiter, our food was outstanding. We started off with the fried pickles and fried onion rings appetizer. They were fried in tempura coating which gave it a nice, light crispy texture. The appetizer was accompanied by curry and ranch dipping sauces. Both were very delicious. I mixed them together, as well. Also very good if you feel like experimenting.Ok so normally I'm not a fan of restaurants that make you order a side via a la carte. However, the main dishes were so large that it was completely unnecessary for each person to get a side. The four of us split the smoked fries as a side. Oh wow, they were so scrumptious. I kept going back for more even though I was full.We ordered the tostadas, pulled goat sandwich, and japchae as our main. They were all very good. The japchae was a bit strange in flavor compared to the more traditional japchaes I've had. However, I thought the goat cheese and eclectic vegetable mix used in the recipe seemed to fit in with the diverse selection of food items on the menu. Overall, we were very happy with our meal and will definitely be back. I just hope we get another waiter next time."
"i love it a lot more than Girl and the Goat (over rated). Little Goat is simple & solid. We just walked in, hang out by the bar and got a table in less than 30 min (no 3 months reservation!!). the price is almost comparable to diners. entree is about the same price with way  better quality ingredients! the difference is their entree didn't come with sides. Their sides are $7 -$12 but there are a lot interesting side options e.g. crab dip and a lot more. we had fried pickle and they were great. I had los drowned. It was huge and yummy! It was very filling though. I had a lot left to go. i basically made 3 meals out of this one sandwich! my friend had boo boo baise which i believe it's a take on bouillabaisse. tons of fresh seafood.. definitely can't get this at other diners! would love to come back again!!"
"To start your Sunday morning on the right track, one may dream of having a good quality breakfast experience.  I found such a place this morning at Little Goat on Randolph.I ordered the corn beef hash and a side of bacon.  I was completely satisfied with the presentation, quality of the meat and overall freshness of the food!  I will be coming back for more.  My only regret was not stopping by the bakery next door and taking home a few hand made treats.A+, highly recommend!!"
"It's been a long time coming for this review. I'm glad to say, that time has come. Little Goat is NOTHING like I expected. In my mind, little goat was a diner, purposely decorated to look dingy like an old time diner. If I had walked into a place like this, I wouldn't have been disappointed. However, I didn't, and I definitely wasn't disappointed with what I saw. Little Goat was very nice inside, I mean, not 5* dining nice, but very casual, while being chic. I thought it was cute. However, enough about the aesthetics. Let's get to the FOOOOOOOOOOOD!So, I had a strip steak, I believe, with crispy potatoes and strawberries...YES, strawberries. It was so unexpected, but it was tasty! I also had a drink with Gin in it...yeah, we don't even have to say how great it was, I'm saying, it was GIN! I forget what my friend had, but he loved it and had been before, so yeah, that tells you this place is not full of hype. What I love is I tried to go online to look at the menu to be more specific about what I had, but THE MENU CHANGED...it's been 3 months since I visited this place, and the menu has already changed! A chef who knows how to keep you begging (and shaking) for more! This wasn't a disappointment. Definitely worth a visit!"
"Really, all I would be doing is echoing the thousands of others that love this place.  My buddy and I were in the neighborhood and started at Haymarket, where we were told that the wait was about 40 minutes.  We headed to Au Chevel, and got the wait down to 35 minutes.  Took a stab at Little Goat, where the dining room wait was 30 minutes, but we were invited to try our luck at the bar.  While crowded, we were able to get a couple stools together.Everything on the menu looks amazing.  We were both in the mood for burgers, and went straight for that section.  My friend went with the regular cheeseburger made with a ground beef patty.  He's a boring guy, but did say that he loved it.I opted for the Korean burger with a goat patty. I was in heaven.  Every bite was so juicy, and creamy (egg yolks), and tangy (kimchi), and all around amazing.We also shared an order of the smoked fries.  My buddy said he could taste the difference from regular french fries, but I couldn't.  Not bad, but I wasn't able to detect the smoky flavor.The service left a bit to be desired, but it wasn't to the point that I wouldn't go back."
"Work with me here. The wallpaper is barely Indian. It's almost paisley, but not quite. It must have been inspired by the parathas burrito because they're twinkies. The breakfast burrito has a touch of Indian with the parathas flatbread, but then it's all these crazy things that only a genius would put together. Avocado and beans; okay. Chili sauce, makes sense. Some cheese; fun, sunny eggs. But then there are these vinaigrettey greens added in and you get all these nutso flavors mixing together for a sweet/sour/spicy/creamy party in each bite from start to finish. The burrito is like the wallpaper - pretty, delicate, and sorta Indian. It's quite eclectic. -- I can't wait to try the other vegetarian/pescetarian options!Things we ate: parathas burrito, the farmers pie, and the miso-hungry for a banana splitThings we drank: a peachy drink and a citrusy gin drink (they worked and tasted great) - their bar menu on the website isn't up to date and I can't remember their names"
Nachos with pulled pork were delicious!! Decent selection of draft beers and a fun atmosphere.
I was here for a private event and our group had the pleasure of having Chef Stephanie personally cook for us.  The food was exceptionally delicious and the service was class A.
"Little goat but big flavors and great choices.I had the Croque Monsieur omelet which is a fancy way of saying Ham and Cheese omelet.  I was having breakfast with coffee, juice, the omelet but when I saw Mac 'n Cheese on the menu, I had to try it.  This was one outstanding dish of Macaroni and Cheese, so good, rich and filling that I couldn't eat it all.  No, that is not a misprint, I DID NOT FINISH SOME MAC N CHEESE.  I got to bring it home and finish it at dinner and it was still delicious.  Since I was breaking all the breakfast rules, I had pie for dessert.  Blood orange chiffon pie for breakfast.  I recommend it, both this pie and the concept.Little goat, you are a new favorite for breakfast and mac n cheese."
"This is my 'Don't Miss' restaurant when I visit Chicago.  I like everything about The Little Goat Diner, especially the inventive kitchen and the huge communal dining room. But diners beware, you need street smarts to even get a chance to enjoy the Little Goat's wonderful food!  The restaurant is a Millennial favorite at the moment and you can't avoid the massive lines unless you are strategic and show up with the Boomers and Babies--namely before 9:00 am!  Well worth the early morning start, even in a Chicago snowstorm!"
"I love love LOVE Little Goat!  It's almost always busy, but for good reason!  I always get their ""Cereal Killers,"" which are served all day... breakfast/brunch is the best ANY time of the day! Almost every entree is under $15, which is extremely affordable for the quality and amount of food you get, especially compared to it's fancy big sister ""Girl & the Goat.""  I've had the corned beef hash, the kimchi/bacon/eggs/pancake Asian breakfast, and the Paratha burrito, all which I've enjoyed immensely!  I've had bites of their blueberry pancakes as well as their chocolate pancakes and their sweet breakfast/brunch items are delicious as well.  My friend ordered their Reuben, which quite frankly looked SOOO good, I may be tempted to order that the next time I come here. :DIt's an amazing restaurant. It's the classic foods you enjoy but with a creative, chef-inspired twist! I highly recommend this place!  But I'd recommend going during the week as opposed to weekends... it really is THAT crowded."
"This review is for the BAR AREA only.Ended up here one night after being so distracted that I didn't notice I'd boarded the Green line instead of the Brown line. So, Morgan is the nearest Green Line stop to Little Goat. Popped in here for a drink, and to see my homegirl, Mama K, who is a Prep Cook/Butcher here - YAY!The bartenders are great, super pro and very friendly. This place is more about the craft cocktails, and I only wanted a straight up vodka martini. Served in a coupe glass, which is kind of weird, as I prefer a traditional martini glass, but the coupe glass fits the aesthetic here. My drink was great, chilly, strong and a little dirty. The interior design of this place is great, I love the look of it. And all the food smelled great, I can't wait to come back and eat some LITTLE GOAT!"
Pork belly pancakes are the deal. I prefer this over girl and the goat.  Only problem is I ate too much!  The bread also is a game changer.
"You know, I was a bit disappointed with Little Goat.  We got the Bull's Eye French Toast -- french toast with a hole-in-one (egg in the middle of the toast), small pieces of deep fried chicken, and candied kumquats.  The candied kumquats provides the much needed sour and citrus to make the syrup less sweet.  We also ordered the Paranthas Burrito which is Indian Fry Bread, sunny side eggs, beans, and avocado.  The burrito happens to be really flavorful -- sour and salty.  The only thing that I feel is missing would be some meat, but that's only because I like meat.   For a side, we got the tempura mashed potatoes-- it's actually really bland (no gravy), but has an interesting texture with the crunch and the soft potato center.  They do NOT take gift certificates for Girl and the Goat.  The bar tab you may start from next door, Little Goat Bread, while waiting for a table is NOT transferable to your diner tab."
"Little Goat is definitely a restaurant we'll return to! We were so pleased with our food, and there were a dozen other things that we would have ordered. We all ordered breakfast options for dinner, which was a ton of fun. The crispy pancakes with kimchi, eggs, and bacon were the favorite. The creative, well-executed cocktails are reasonably-priced ($10 each). They offer a citrus-spin on the Manhattan that's fantastic.Also, when the weather allows, they have patio seating."
"This review if for their private event space.  My company had a private event to entertain a client and rented out the upstairs for a beer pairing dinner.The upstairs private area is very inviting.  It didn't seem like we were in a restaurant, more like in the dining room at a friend's house.  The dining area is open up to the kitchen area which looks much like a kitchen you would find in someone's house. While waiting for the rest of our party to arrive, we were served some light appetizers, crab dip and crackers, spring rolls, and fried pickles and onion rings, all very tasty!  We gathered on their rooftop area, just outside the dining room.  This is a gorgeous space, with plenty of comfortable seating and an outside bar.  Dinner started with a chickpea and kale salad, tossed with a very light and tangy vinaigrette.Goat empanadas, stuffed with marinated sheep feta, very good!  Next course was the diver scallops.  This was a HUGE diver scallop topped with a delicious salsa verde.  The main course was kalbi beef ribs, goat neck and sauteed green beans.  The ribs were... interesting.  A bit too chewy and hard for my taste.  The flavor was good, but the consistency was not the best.  Of all the menu items I was most apprehensive about, it was the goat neck.  Turned out to be my favorite dish served!  It tasted similar to pot roast.  Moist, tender and fell off the bone!  Delicious!  The main courses were served family style.  All courses were paired with a different beer.  The beer lover in me, thoroughly enjoyed every beer.  Each course's pairings complimented the food very well!Dessert was a cheez-it sundae!  Yes, cheez-its!  A small sundae with strawberry, peanut butter and vanilla ice cream served on top of crumbled cheez-its that had been coated in chocolate!  All of this was topped with whipped cream and a maraschino cherry.  Perfect sized portion and flavor to end a great meal!If you're looking for a unique private party dining experience with great food and excellent service, Little Goat is definitely the spot!"
"Don't let the sometimes odd ingredients scare you away from trying things, I had the Ruben with Kimchi and it was excellent. We had no problem getting a seat at the counter but there did seem to be a wait for groups of 4 or larger. The portion sizes seem to be inconsistent which is my only complaint, at first I was concerned since I saw things coming out of the kitchen that seemed quite large but for my Reuben it was smaller than I was expecting. Still I will be back to try other combos since the Kimchi blended so well with my sandwich."
"The NACHOS. The Bloody Mary. The innovative seasonal drinks! I think I've eaten here about four times and never was I ever disappointed.My boyfriend is a hot waiter here so I could be a little biased, but the food really is delicious and the waiters/waitresses are super nice!"
"If I can give it 10 stars I would. It was that amazing!!!! I got the Braden belly (their version of Benedict) with pork and eggs and this special sauce...so good!!! The meat was so tender!!!!!! We also had this mashed potatoes...tempura style and that was just perfect! Crispy on the outside, nice and soft on the inside!!! Our server was very friendly and helpful! Really, all our interaction with their staff was just great! Seats are comfortable, very trendy decor inside! Ohhh and they serve breakfast, lunch, and dinner all day!!! I would definitely come here again!!!!!!"
"Little Goat is great for a group of 6-8 -- those booths are awesome! We had a bit of a wait, but we just went over to Haymarket and downed a few before they texted us letting us know our table was ready.The hostess and server were awesome. Our food came out really quickly, too! I ordered a Rosemary Daly cocktail and a Korean Burger with goat and split some fries. The fries were great, but the drink didn't taste like a mixed drink at all... it just tasted like sugary lemon water. Not even a hint of rosemary. A big bummer, especially considering it cost $10.The Korean burger also struck out. I was looking forward to the spiciness of the kimchi... but instead all I got was cold bacon/egg and kimchi that tasted like normal cabbage. The goat pattie was good but not too different from beef; it also had difficulty staying together as one coherent patty, meaning I had to go in with a fork to finish it. The bun was pretty banging, though!I had a sip of a smoked pork and toffee shake. It was alright (when it was served it definitely could have been a lot colder :/ ), but again, sort of flavorless. It tasted like a sweet milkshake that maybe was a tiny bit savory if I squinted hard enough. I did try some of the peppermint mattie, which was AWESOME. It was delicious chocolate ice cream with a spicy chili pepper aftertaste.... damn. I don't think I'll be headed here again, especially for a burger. I ended up spending ~33 for a meal that left me wanting something else instead. Next time I'm in the west loop, I'll keep in mind that Au Cheval is right down the block, and as for drinks... I'd pass over this place."
"Affiliated with Girl and the Goat, we felt that Little Goat would be worth checking out for brunch. We waited less than an hour for a table for 3 on a Friday morning (and it wasn't even a holiday!). There is a Starbucks just down the street if you're looking for a boost before the meal.There were so many good choices on the menu. We had a really difficult time deciding what to get but we finally settled on the pork belly pancake and los drowned. The pork belly pancake (scallion pancake . house hoisin . bok choy salad . ginger maple dressing) was on a flat pancake. The house hoisin and ginger maple dressing are both really tasty!The los drowned sandwich (braised beef . avocado . butterkase cheese . pickled peppers 'n onions . spicy mayo . hoagie) was worth the mess it made... and it only made a mess because it was pretty much inhaled by my boyfriend.Clearly, no one leaves the Little Goat disappointed!"
"This has to be one of my favorite diners to open in Chicago. If only it was closer to me I would dine there 3 times a week. The wait can be really long, but let me tell you it's worth it. Sit in the coffee shop and have a delicious latte (or Bloody Mary) and watch them make the bread while you wait. I have been here a few times now. My favorites being the crab dip appetizer (love the fact that it's served with ritz crackers), the Asian pulled pork sandwich, and the Club sandwich. All so darn good. My friend has the goat burger and said it was so filling and tasty he couldn't even finish it. Mind you, he's a big eater too. It's a bit more pricey than your average diner, but if you're looking to splurge a little, this is the spot."
"This review for the Front Of House. I called in with the legitimate, honest question of whether or not they will have the Bears game on, as we were scheduled for a function there on a Sunday afternoon. I was told with an unprovoked attitude that ""We don't like football. Watch it on your phone."" While I appreciate that they may get asked this question quite often, a FOH member at any decent restaurant recieves no excuse for a total lack of courtesy and professionalism. If I had been making my own plans to go there, I definitely wouldn't have done so after that conversation."
"The kimchee-bacon-pancake-tasty-thingy is addictive, as is the parathas burrito.  Get a booth and make bad choices; you'll still feel good about them in the morning."
"Now this was more like it. Not a $65 snoozefest like the ""Girl and the Goat"".I sat in the bar for a few minutes waiting for my friend. They had a nice earthy Saison. Way better beer selection than the other resturant last fall.I had the grilled cheese. The sandwiches are HUGE.best tomatos I have had in long time, gooy cheese and crusty bread. Nice balance of cheese vs bread vs  other ""stuff "" in the sandwich.I also had a portion of the ""los drown""- its a french dip sandiwch ( we didnt know that when we ordered it). The beef was tender and really good.The only thing I would say pass on was the hash browns. Compared to the sandwiches, they were boring and without much taste."
"The service is friendly, and the hipster staff is not too pretentious.I've only been here for breakfast, once mid-morning and another time early when they first opened. If you are coming in for a weekend breakfast, it is definitely worth it to get there right when they open. The line builds fast, and you may find yourself waiting for a while.It's VERY nice that they offer a vegan menu, even though it is super limited. At least it's a nod to the fact that we aren't all carnivores. However, if Stephanie Izard put the same skill and creativity into the vegan menu that she put into the regular menu, it would be f'ing amazing, I'm sure.**Hey Stephanie -- hook-up the vegan menu, please, please, pretty please!**As it stands, this is one of my stand-by options for weekend breakfasts with non-vegans, knowing they will have something awesome, and I will at least have something (albeit less awesome)."
"Our server was Sean, and he was AWESOME!  Friendly, attentive, helpful.  Huge thumbs up!  We ordered a lot for three people:  waffles and chicken, omelet of the day (crab ragoon version----yep!), pancakes for child, and sides of potatoes, and sausages.  Ohhhh... plus a cinnamon roll.  You are now thinking what I am thinking....I will not be eating again for a week.  Everything was quite good.  Breakfast cocktails were adequate but not amazing.  My daughter loved her hot chocolate, which was served with a lovely swirl on top.I would not wait to dine here (yes, I have seen the lines and shivering patrons waiting outside), but I will happily eat here again.  This is a DINER, but a pleasant (and pricier spin) on the average diner."
"Wowza! This just might be one of my new Chicago food favorites!Food. Amazing.Asian Shrimp Salad = Many times when you go to a new restaurant and the options are many, you are inclined to choose a non-salad item.....after all most places aren't known for their salads, right? After asking the waitress which option of two she recommended (the other was a sandwich) she pushed me toward the Asian Shrimp Salad. Boy, I'm glad she did! Not only was it amazingly tasty, but it was fresh and light, something that I needed that day. Tonkatsu (pork cutlet, asian bbq, mayo, cabbago and white bread) = my male companion was in utter bliss the entire time. I take that as a score!Other food = looked amazing. Especially the nacho's. I guess another trip is in the cards. Space. Amazing.Walking in, your eyes don't know where to go. This diner is not your typical, with lots of light streaming in from all sides and white everywhere. It was refreshing to feel warm and sunned on.Go to Little Goat. That's all I can say."
"Izard...you are killing me!  Two stars based on two bad breakfast visits.  Plus the fact that this over-hyped restaurant has created over crowding at every other place on Randolph restaurant row annoys me.  I know I know...it is good for other businesses, but it still irks me.  So Izard, read on and take a listen.  Visit #1 - Woke up ""early"" to meet our friends there.  Water issue, had to leave.  Visit #2 - Two little half breeds in tow, ordered the smoked corned beef hash.  Salty!  I mean to the point I tried to choke it down and finally told the waiter it was inedible.  I can't remember the last time I sent a meal back to the kitchen.  The waiter was cool and took it off the bill, but really.  It tasted like someone dropped a salt shaker in the corned beef.  BTW...Corned Beef Hash is my measuring stick on a breakfast place.  Izard you friggin' failed.  The only redeeming part of the meal was the kimchi cream cheese.  Visit #3 - Brought the wife and the half breeds.  Brandade and Belly this time.  Not great.  Just cause you put some Korean related things on the menu to ""spice"" things up doesn't make it good.  I've had kimchee with everything in my life, and this wasn't in the try again list.  C'mon Izard, you are killing me.  I wanted to try the Korean breakfast thing, but then I remembered that I grew up eating Korean breakfast...which is basically the same as Korean lunch and dinner...you just eat it at 7 AM instead of 12 PM or 7 PM.  Michigan Football sucks this year and this Michigan alum's restaurant sucks too."
"Everytime I go, I try something new and live it! This place has never let me down. Try the brandade, biscuits & gravy, or anything else for that matter! Make sure you save room for pie and goat's chocolate milk!!!"
"The food overall was a bit too salty for my taste, but all the dishes were delicious. My fave was the biscuit and gravy. The grits well...I'm not a fan in general. The waffles were so good! The bacon, syrup, and peanut butter was a great combo! It's a must to try this place out if you are in Chi-Town!"
"Bloody mary's are stuffed with goat cheese - how clever!  I got the Bullseye French toast and it knocked my socks off.  Not a lot of healthy options on this menu, just flavorful, unique combinations!  It's a pretty big space with nice large booths and tables.  We got seated pretty quickly but there is also a bar to sit at and get a drink while you wait."
"This is also a review on bakery.Today, I got a couple of Conchas and chocolate croissant with vanilla latte.  This croissant was definitely one of a kind.  In love with chocolate croissant, I have tried it from a lot of places I think this is arguably the best I have tried.  My wife agrees, too.  Also, latte was not too sweet but quite tasty.Now this place is, to me, one of those places you should try if you are in town."
"Happy Birthday small child!This was my now 6 year olds choice for lunch on his birthday.See about a month and a half ago we tried to go to Little Goat to be informed at the door that they were closing their kitchen for a few hours to catch up. I understand new restaurant, not yet learning how to manage the business flow, whatever. They produced one small angry client. He left hungry with a Little Goat refrigerator magnet.Fast forward Birthday lunch.Campy and good, amp'd up diner food i.e. albacore tuna melt nicoise.An easier way to try Stephanie Izard's delicious chow, the big goat is better but the little one is much more accessible, unless the kitchen is closed."
"Overrated... I think this restaurant definitely does not live up to the hype.... Food is mediocre and if you want the worst service in town, welcome to this place. Your existence means nothing but tips to the waiters..."
"GATG is my favorite restaurant, so I was excited to try Little Goat. This one is a bit hard for me to review because it's reminiscent of other restaurants I've been to....A little bit of Hash House Agogo and almost like a Kuma's for sandwiches, with an extended menu.Cocktails: Very good. I had the Pisco Sour-type one and their version of a Manhattan. Sorry, don't remember the names, but you'll know when you read the menu. They were both great.Food: Los Drowned-Great flavor in beef, and very tender.Root vegetables-meh. Cooked well, but I could've taken or left it.2 Quails-Quail was perfectly cooked. Great flavor in the salad on top. The gravy is oily, but good flavor. I probably wouldn't order this again and opt for a sandwich instead.Macaroni and cheese-surprisingly bland. We had leftovers, so I took it home and doused it with pepper and hot sauce. Good consistency, though. Pork and Toffee shake: Yes, please. This was so good. The pork was not overpowering but you can taste it just enough to say, ahhhhh. Paired great with the toffee.Service/seating: We didn't wait because they sat us at the counter. I do not recommend this when the weather is hot outside because it is a broiler. The counter is in front of the kitchen and where the orders come up for pick up. There is heat emanating to the counters and I was sweating during my meal. Very uncomfortable. Service was good. Waiter was attentive.I almost want to give this place 3 stars because of the heatwave experience, but know I would've been fine at a table."
"Bull's eye french Toast is that type of food that deserves it's own category.... Not just food,  but an art of flavors haha loved it"
Shrimp sandwichOverhyped. 2 hour wait for hipster diner food? I'd rather go to girl and the goat for that kind of wait.
I've been to little goat several times now.Several?! it's only been open a short while! What can I say?! It's amazing.The menu is gargantuan and i want to try everything.Biscuits and gravy are good.I got almost an entire half pound of bacon for a normal bacon side order. It seems like they've cut back on that a bit now but I am still so happy with their bacon.The bagels are good.The cream cheeses are bizarre combos but really delicious.If you go as a solo diner you almost never have to wait. Usually seating available at the counter and you get to watch the food come out. A sweet bonus.
"Visited Saturday 10/ 4/14,  afternoon about 2:30 PM. The food, as anticipated, was awesome. Can't go wrong with the pig in a blanket, actually goat sausage in a blanket.  My fifth star goes to the staff.  Our server, Andrea, I hope i remebered the correct name, inked arms, was fantastic.  Our hostess was very engaging and took good care of our group of 5.  Great staff made my first trip there a great experience.  Can't wait to go back and to also recommend it to friends.Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."
"Mmmmm. We tried to go to Au Chevel, but there was a 45 minute wait at 11pm on a Wednesday!! So we went here instead, and I'm so glad we did! I've been wanting to try it anyway. The menu almost has too many items on it for my little indecisive brain. I wanted like 20 things. Luckily, my 4 friends and I love to share, so we each got something, plus some mac and cheese and smoked fries for the table. I actually thing the smoked fries were one of the best things we got! The cheese sauce that it came with was yummy. I decided to get the kimchi, bacon, eggs, pancakes tasty thing (or something like that) because I'm really liking kimchi lately. It was really good, and had a good balance of some flavor, but not overpowering. I also tried the goat burger, and it had a very interesting taste. So different than regular beef. I would love to come back a few more times so I can try everything! I felt like the prices were okay as well, so that makes it even better."
"Really great food and service. I'm so glad my husband found this place. I would definitely recommend for those seeking sweet background toons and delicious, inventive food."
"Possibly the best diner in Chicago.   Tough to get in here on the weekends, but worth the wait.   (If there's an hour wait for tables, I grab some snacks from the Little Goat coffee counter next store -- or some bread/salami from Publican Meat Market down the street.)   I recently had a delightful breakfast here of hash browns, bacon, and a delicious mezcal cocktail.    Menu is a bit wacky but never disappoints.   I haven't tried the rooftop bar yet but I'll bet it's also awesome.UPDATE:  I'm updating my review from 5 starts to 4.   I still love this restaurant and will return again.   But some mention must be made of the unnecessarily high menu prices.   Yes, I know that innovative dining establishments should charge a bit more -- especially if they are in a trendy neighborhood.  But come on!  $11 for pancakes?   $3.50 for a soft drink?   Feels like a bit of a gouge."
"I went to Little Goat for brunch yesterday with a couple friends and had an amazing time! We arrived at 1030am and were met with a 75 minute wait. We killed the time by walking to French Market and hanging out for a bit. They have a smart idea of texting people to let them know when it's their time to be seated. So smart and techy! When we got back to Little Goat at 1145, the wait had significantly died down and just a few people were waiting. My advice based on this experience is not to go at 1030 on a Saturday. :)The host was super nice and seated us in a booth which we were very thankful for. Our server was also super nice throughout the entire experience. Her outfit was super cute - diner chic purple with a little goat on the top. Loved it! I was obsessed with the music playing which was all 90s music and a lot of good 90s rap - I Get Around from Tupac played which had me boppin' in my seat! My two friends and I each ordered a main dish and then we ordered a couple of sides to try, as well. I started with the Chocolate Goat's Milk for $3. Personally I would skip this next time as I found it to be a bit grainy and not rich in chocolate. I got this for myself as a little indulgence and I honestly don't think it was worth the precious calories spent. Before I went I perused the menu and knew I wanted to try the Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup. Words cannot even express how good they were! I've never had a Crumpet before and my British coworkers had explained to me how good they were. I was psyched to see it on the menu as I'm going to London in 5 weeks and thought it would be good preparation! The crumpet was so soft and gooey which I love in my baked goods. None of that crunchy, overbaked grossness. The maple syrup...ahhhhhh the maple syrup. What a perfect pairing with the chorizo which had but a dash of heat to it. I was very happy that it wasn't overly spiced and just an delicious and simple, yet inventive, dish. I'm pleased to report it was a huge portion and with all our sides I was able to eat one crumpet while at the diner, one crumpet for dinner that night and one for breakfast this morning. Yep, it made me three meals out of this amazing $11 dish.I tried both of my friends dishes - Los Drowned $12 and Bull's Eye French Toast $13. The braised beef on Los Drowned was quite good & piled on but overall I wasn't blown away. The chicken and maple syrup on the french toast was great, as well but again not completely blown away.We ordered the tempura mashed potatoes ($5) and broccoli & cheese puff ($7) for our side dishes and that's when our brunch got super fun. At least for me. Apparently the usual puffs for the broccoli & cheese puff were not yet ready so they plated ours on top of more of a crumpet looking pastry. This was a total win for us because the pastry was so mouthwatering, the super nice manager brought it out to us & said Stephanie apologizes, plus we had it comped from our bill! I can't believe how super nice they were for such a minor change. We were completely okay with this and all enjoyed the pastry part of the puff very much! I preferred the tempura mashed potatoes of our two side dishes. We all agreed it was similar to a croquette except with tempura breading. It was so delicious I can't put it into words! With the little misstep noted above, my friend asked if we could meet Stephanie. Now I've seen her the three times I've been to Girl & a Goat, at Baconfest the past couple years and one other food fest...but I've never had any real 1 on 1 interaction because I'm such a nervous dork about cheflebrities. She was very nice and we truly appreciated her stepping away from the kitchen for us! She even let us take a pic with her...so sweet! We also took a pic with the manager because he was such a nice fella.Total for 3 hungry girls with tax and tip was $65. I was so happy to finally get to try Little Goat after anxiously awaiting it's opening and waiting for my time to stop in. I will absolutely be back and highly recommend the Crumpets to others going!Pro-Tip: No need for the $10 valet. The surrounding blocks seem to always have parking for all of the restaurants on Randolph.As long as you're okay with walking a block or two, then street park!"
"I've been to Little Goat three times already, and each time has been delicious! Comfort food at its finest. Some favorites: Vegetarian Korean Burger, Parathas Burrito, Fried Pickles/OnionsI recommend!"
Yum...I went here for dinner with a girlfriend and we were greeted by the nicest but not fake hostess ever...We were seated at the communal table and its not close quarters where you don't feel like you are sitting on top of each other or sitting too close to odd family members at Thanksgiving. :). The only thing I did not like was this douche bag who was not in our party but seated next to us  thought because we were at a communal table felt like every time our waiter came to make sure that my friend and I were ok or  needed something that he felt it was an opportunity to talk over us and make sure he got what he needed from our server. The interiors are modern but not too minamalistic where you feel like you are eating in an empty room....the lighting was warm and inviting. After immediately being seated we were greeted by our very friendly and very knowledgable waiter. He asked us if we were allergic to anything and I appreciated that considering I am allergic to everything and will be living on water and air eventually. After we ordered he stated things that I may be allergic to-to make sure I was ok-I was so impressed he knew the menu so well and he did not make it like it was a chore-he was happy to make sure that we had an enjoyable meal....which unfortunately at some places it always seems like more a nuisance that you are allergic to something. Our food was amazing....-We ordered bowls of the butternut squash soup with fried onion rings  which was the special that day  but I could have eaten the whole bowl and be super satisfied....we also had the apple tomato soup which was equally amazing. -The little pile of macaroni and cheese deliciousness that I am still thinking of....-We had fish tostados which I am still trying to decipher all the ingredients-because all of the components melded so well together.-Brussel sprouts were just yummy...not over cooked just a little bowl of green perfectness -Dessert....yum it was a little Turtle Pie...The only thing I did not like was the Veggie Chop Che being korean and having it homemade by loving grandparents....the Little Goats version did not do it for me...it seemed like Chop Che with too much tomato sauce. I would come by again for the excellent service and yummy delights. To this inviting warm eatery...
"Everyone waits, even if it's 2:30pm on a random Tuesday. After eating here, I'm not sure it's worth the wait.First, the waitstaff and atmosphere is great. The restaurant is well set up to accommodate all kinds of groups, and is clean and well kept. It's tight seating, but not overly loud. Not the best place for a private conversation though.All of the food was well made, but nothing really impressive. I had the patty melt, and despite all of the praise for the bread, it really fell flat in the sandwich. It was sliced too thin, and didn't have a lot of flavor - similarly with the beef, just not a lot of flavor.The sides were again, good, but not great. We tried the tempura mashed, super unique but I wouldn't get them again, the mac & cheese - probably the best thing I ate, and the home fries - slightly below average diner home fries. Maybe the breakfast items would be better and more flavorful?It's also a lot more expensive than any other diner, but not necessarily worth the wait. Great service, good atmosphere, but I think there are other places that are better, and better value."
"Really do love this place. Aside from the bloody wait times on weekends, there's little wrong with it...the eccentric and quirky decor, the fun menu, the coffee bar...it's just a great sensory experience all around. I've taken quite a few out-of-towners there for weekend brunch, and it's been a hit every time. I love the goat milk latte (can't remember the name) and the chicken and waffle remix they offer. Definitely a Chicago brunch spot to put on your bucket list :)"
"Unfortunately, Little Goat disappoints overall.Since its opening, I've been to the restaurant at least 6-7 times for dinner, lunch and brunch. In the process, I've tried several of the main stays on the menu in addition to the seasonal items and variations--I feel confident that I have a good grasp of the menu as a result. To be fair, there are always one or two stand-out dishes or drinks, but the overall dining experience is consistently flat, even mediocre.I'll give you a few examples of the ""bad"" for good measure:-Fried Chicken: Strangely enough, the fried chicken smelled and tasted like an old refrigerator. I know that sounds harsh, but I'm not trying to be. The chicken literally had the stale-stinky-sweet smell of an industrial refrigerator. The breading wasn't properly seasoned and thus, lacked the hallmark buttery-fatty flavor of real, southern-style fried chicken. The breading also fell off the meat of the chicken a little too easily. The mashed potatoes that came on the side were excellent, however.-Tempura Mashed Potatoes: Sounds good doesn't it? Imagine my disappointment when the final product resembled a cold, stiff assemblage of paste. The mashed potatoes were so thick, they were hardly edible. They stuck to the back of my throat and refused to be swallowed. The tempura exterior was stale, wet and also, strangely odiferous. -Hot Crab Dip: I love crab dip, I love salty things. This was too salty. Even for me. I enjoyed it for a few bites, but within a few minutes I began to feel parched and I could no longer taste anything else. -Another unforgivable item: The music they play at this venue is awful; Pearl Jam, Journey, Kansas, Meat Loaf. It's like one college-bro anthem after another. WHAT ARE YOU THINKING?To be fair, the cocktails, salads and the BLT sandwich they served during the warmer months were always pretty great.It's not my favorite and I certainly wouldn't recommend this restaurant to anyone I was trying to impress. I'll stick to Girl & the Goat."
"2.5 starswas super stoked to try this place, as our can't-get-a-rezzo-at-girl-and-the-goat option. the wait wasn't terrible, just shy of 40 minutes. I was super intrigued by the BREAKFAST SPAGHETTI and was looking forward to the seafood; alas the dish came with a spaghetti/crab/clams patty in a broth that was SO. SALTY. I initially ate through it but once I passed mid-way, it felt like my tongue was corroding away. I was too timid to say anything to the server so unfortunately I can't comment on how they might've responded. on the other hand, the bit of the BULL'S EYE FRENCH TOAST that I tried was delish. the fried chicken played off the syrup'd French toast nicely and the soft cooked egg was hidden in the thick brioche.i'm still curious to try some more items off the menu the next time i'm in Chicago but little goat, I was bummed."
I thought this place was going to be trendy and stuffy and over priced but it wasn't! It was trendy and delicious and comfortable. Not over priced but certainly packed for brunch.
"Ignore any star rating less than 5. This place is great. Awesome breakfast, fabulous coffee and their lunch items are amazing. Yes, there might be a wait, but that happens. There is first come first serve at the bar in the back and there always seems to be a seat there. They do have inventive dishes, so don't come in with your own expectations of someone else's creative spin on the flavor. Come in with an open mind and an empty stomach, you will not be disappointed."
Sent some business associates from Charlotte here for lunch while they were in Chicago. 5 stars from all 6 of them!
"I am reviewing the sandwich/coffee shop portion, not the diner.First, I had one of their $2 bagels, and it was AWFUL.  Avoid the bagels at all costs.  It tastes like a hard dinner roll.  I am not sure why people are trying to reinvent the bagel, but most of them are failing.  AVOID,AVOID, AVOID.  Litle Goat needs a little work here.I also got the turkey sandwich to go.  The turkey sandwich was good.  It had roasted almonds on it and a blue cheese that gave it a very unique flavor.  That being said, the bread was pretty unimpressive, and considering that they are baking it fresh, it was a big disappointment.The sandwich and the plain bagel cost me $12.25.  Not a great value if you ask me.With regard to the decor, the bar area is very cool and I liked the open viewing of the baking area.  I would actually say this is the nicest part of the whole place, as the diner portion looks pretty boring and run of the mill.I could see myself coming back for a sandwich, but I won't rush back.  And there is no way I am going to wait an hour and a half for a table in the main room (that was the wait over the weekend at 1pm).  3 stars for now.  More to come after I try another sandwich or eat in the diner area."
"The party's here on the Westside!  youtube.com/watch?v=0hiU…The stars perfectly aligned for my visit to Little Goat.  I'm a huge fan of Chef and love G&G.  So, I was giddy to drop in and give the lil guy a try.  Jam packed for lunch at the high noon hour.  Flying solo, I was able to take it right to the counter.  I kept turning around from my seat to take it all in.  This space has been completely redone and bears only the address in relation to the prior tenant Red Light.  Diner on one side, Bread on the other.  I checked out the cocktail/beer list and the menu.  Local brews on tap, and even Coors on draft.  That's pretty special considering there was a time when you couldn't get it East of the Rockies.  Breakfast is served all day, and that's what I'd be having.  I zeroed in on the Fat Elvis Waffles-banana/peanut butter butter/bacon maple syrup.  I also couldn't pass on the hash browns made with goat cheese.  I had some coffee with my brunch and my cup was never empty.  Service was spot on and every employee that I spoke with was helpful and very friendly.  The place is crowded, everyone's busy and they still have time to be pleasant.  Love it.  I enjoyed chatting with my fellow diners at the counter.  We all watched hungrily as dishes came out of the kitchen and made their way through the restaurant.  I saw milkshakes, onion rings and fried pickles, and the rueben with kimchee and they all looked great.  It was about this time that I noticed that Chef was working in the kitchen right across from me!  Out come my waffles, followed shortly by the hash browns.  They were piping hot and the butter melted perfectly all over my waffles.  Bacon in maple syrup may just be the best way to have bacon.  Not like there is a bad way.  I wanted some hot sauce for the hash browns and my server brought out two house made sauces.  House. Made. Hot. Sauce.  You'll want to be skipping the ketchup and use those instead.  To my surprise, I liked the milder one more.  The goat cheese was a delicious touch to the potatoes and I loved them.  As I was finishing up, chef dropped by to say hello and ask how I enjoyed the waffles.  Very much, thank you.  She then mentioned that she had made them herself.  How cool is that?!?  I told her that we love her places and live in the neighborhood.  I thanked her for all of the great craft beers on the menu and then she grabbed us tasters of her Haymarket collaboration Girl and the Goat 3 brew.  Cheers Chef, what a treat this was!  And let me channel my inner Brent Musberger, Chef's beaming smile and amiable personality set the tone for a great vibe.  My neighbor's got much flavor!"
"Overrated. The brandade & belly couldve used more pork belly but was decent. The biscuits n gravy, mac n cheese, bullseye french toast, and dark chocolate pancakes all lacked flavor, and left me full but my tastebuds far from satisfied. Definitely did not live up to the hype."
"We went at 9:15am on a Saturday morning and had about a 15 minute wait, which was completely okay as we waited in the back coffee and bread shop, where we grabbed coffees and comfortably sat at the counter.We were seated at the long counter which overlooks the kitchen.  Service was VERY slow, and I am wondering if it was where we were seated or just typical for Little Goat.  If I go back and service is this slow again (waiting 15 minutes for a cup of coffee early morning is inexcusable), I will have to go down to three stars.  Also, they need more coat racks to hang longer coats.  BUT I give four stars because my food was amazing.  I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles, which are peanut butter waffles topped with bananas and bacon maple syrup.  Seriously, the best breakfast dish I have ever had.  I'll be back just to order it again.  My friend had the Spanish Omelet, which looked very souped-up and she said was good but nothing overly special.The menu is extensive so I look forward to checking out Little Goat again!"
Where else can you get great diner food and great cocktails?  The Little Goat did not disappoint.  The mac and cheese is a definite must.  Don't order too much as the food is super rich and will fill you up quickly.
"I went down to the west loop on a Friday afternoon for lunch, and decided to stop by Little Goat afterwards since it was down the street. I'm a lazy person. So...second lunch? I may or may not be a hobbit. Like everyone else I love Girl & the Goat, but I'm not jizzing my pants over Little Goat. I just wanted it to be better.To offset the absence of hunger, I ordered the Los Drowned sandwich (sammich?) which is filled with things I love: braised beef, pickled red onions, mayo, avocado and pickles. In the meantime, I had an Oskar Blues scotch ale, because it seemed like the perfect day to day drink. Beer list is alright, but the cocktail list leaves something to be desired: no whiskey cocktails? Ugh.Sandwich time. It was huge, which is normally a good thing. However the bread was getting soggy/overwhelmed by the sandwich innards, and I couldn't even pick it up without shit falling out everywhere. It came with jus on the side, but what? How is that even supposed to work? I have no problem sticking my face into food, but scooping braised meat into my mouth by hand while wrestling to keep a bun intact is not what I want to do on a midday buzz. Usually braised meat is the key to my heart but not this time. The smoked fries, thankfully, were delicious. Though looking at other reviews, the fries seem to be inconsistent. Womp. No friends? You can still get fries! They take pity on us and offer half orders to parties of 1. In the end, half the sandwich came home with me. Eating it the next day, it was still a hot mess and underwhelming. Super womp.Why is Stephanie Izard walking around mumbling about eating pie filling? Actually, that was entertaining. I talked to my waiter about other menu items, because I was surprised that kimchi was on five different dishes. Paraphrased but pretty close to actual words exchanged: ""Is it actual kimchi?"" ""Well no it's toned down, because we're trying to appeal to a wider audience."" What the shit?Obviously I'll give it another shot. It's not bad food, but I feel like it's not unfair to expect more. Good job on the bathrooms, though, on which everyone secretly or not-so-secretly judge all restaurants."
"Great place to get diner style breakfast with the modern twist and airy modern rustic decor. The prices are great for the quality. Can I suggest the sweet and savory combination that the restaurant should add to the menu? My own creation. Ooey Gooey cinnamon bun with pork belly and feel good kale slaw (or whatever you serve on top of pork belly pancake). I ordered the pork belly pancake which is actually ""roti"". It lacks the sweet flavor of either maply syrup, hoisin, or condensed milk on pancake. Finish it off with freshly squeezed orange juice to start your day."
"This place is legit! I have heard rave reviews from my friends & also read so many wonderful things here, so we knew we had to try Little Goat for ourselves! We had to wait about 30 minutes, but it wasn't bad because there is a bar & a coffee counter that you can wait in & it makes the wait time seem much shorter than it actually is. Lots of unique products to look at and purchase. We started with the macho nachos & fried pickles & onions & both were AMAZING! The nachos were probably the best I've ever had & the pulled pork on them was to die for. The fried pickles & onions were tempura battered & delicious. We had 4 people in our party & we all tried a different entree. My boyfriend had the beef ravioli (it was pretty good), one friend had a mushroom burger that looked unbelievable & she loved it. It was topped with plenty of cheese & meat & definitely sharable! Our other friend had a goat burger and added an egg. He loved it! I had the pork belly pancake because of all of the wonderful reviews about it and it was SO SO GOOD! It has a bit of an Asian flare to it. It was like nothing I had ever tasted before & that was exactly what I was looking for at Little Goat!The star of the dinner was hands down the dessert and we were NOT expecting that! Each of our friends got a dessert & I tried a bite of each. Cheez-It Sundae!!! OMG. I know it sounds so weird but it just works!!! Try it & don't look back! The gelato it is served with...unbelievable. Our other friend got the cookie shake & it was FILLED with cookies & caramel...so delicious!All in all, the experience here was top notch & we WILL be back when we are in Chicago!"
"Another where I wish we could do half stars - 4.5!We came in tonight for dinner.  No wait - got seated in a big booth right away, which was nice.  Really friendly service - our server was really nice and gave great recommendations and even the bussers and random people who were helping out were just very friendly.  Good timing with everything, not too hover-y.  I like that.In no specific order, we tried:chili cheese fries (YUM - goat chili, I mean COME ON)fish stick bisquetomato soup (lemon-y sharp and good stuff)fat Elvis waffles (so, so, so good - peanut butter butter?! could only be improved with some chocolate or nutella)the fat club (maybe a little dry - needed some more mayo)parathas burrito (everybody who got a bite loved it)the banh mi of the day (goat liver mousse and chickenpork belly pancake (yum!)blood orange meringue pie (not too orange-y but nice and bright and almost like a creamsicle)choco taco (not really built for sharing but quite good!)little goat (this is a yummy espresso drink made with goat milk, caramel and whipped cream - perfectly not too sweet!)Great food overall - maybe needs a little tweaking in some instances but just tasty stuff.  Also, some of the best-cooked bacon I've ever had - it literally melted in my mouth!Very comfortable interior - a lot brighter and warmer than Girl & the Goat but it's a different vibe all together, I think.  I think we'll come back!"
"Not as sophisticated and trendy as Girl and the Goat, but certainly, if not almost, as crazily creative and in a good way. There's something for every palate, especially if the diner ignores the huge amount of butter, oil or grease and sodium is used to make each dish. Everything from sandwiches, to pork belly, to mac and cheese, to the oh so greasy and delicious fries are wonderful. The only ho hum aspect to the meal are the desserts, which are commonplace, yet good and sweet."
imo this place only deserves 2.5 stars.  Nice hipster atmosphere but service and food was sub-par for the price.  I like my Potbelly sandwich or Torta from Frontera Grill way more than what I had here.
"Sunday morning breakfast with the fam.  Arrived just after 9:30am, was offered choice between immediate seating at a community table or 10-15 minute wait for a booth.  We opted for the booth.When we first got there, there was only one couple in front of us, but others started filing in quickly and soon it was crowded.  15 or so minutes or later, the hostess stopped by to apologize and let us know she'd forgotten about us but that we'd have the next table which was being cleaned off.  We were seated about 5 minutes later, so no biggie.It was worth the wait.  Too much to choose from on a fun menu (Cereal Killer, Sammiches, Simple/Healthy/Hungry Goat).  Kids both had the grilled cheese/fries off the kids menu, I had the shrimp and grits, he had the Bandade Belly Benedict.  We also ordered two sides of Gunthrop Farm bacon...cuz we like bacon.  It was a lot of food - and we ate all the bacon because it was thick and crispy.  Martinelli apple juice (kids), cream soda (him), coffee black (me).  The coffee was dark and robust.  I usually take sugar sub and milk w/my coffee, but the rich flavor of the coffee was good on its own.I loved the shrimp and grits, great savory flavor.  Shrimp were cooked perfectly, generously portioned, and the cheesy grits were the right consistency of grainy/soft/buttery, and the tomato broth, pistachios (tender) and brussel sprouts made it unique.  The grilled cheeses' cheese was melted all the way through and the bread golden brown...so simple yet so good especially here at the Little Goat.  The fries well seasoned with the right amount of crisp.  I didn't try the Bandade but he was more than happy with it (Cod/Pork Belly/Kale/Kimchi/Eggs).  I'm not a Kimchi fan, but it looked so good that I would have attempted it had he not eaten it all so quickly.  He did have a bite of the grits and then helped himself to more cuz the grits were that good.Our server was great.  Attentive but not intrusive, checking in and making sure we were doing good.  Food came out quickly and our water glasses were always full.I love the atmosphere in the diner...homestyle chic.  Comfy modern vintage vibe, in line with the other establishments in the W Loop.  Ample room in our booth (near the front of the restaurant, behind the hostess stand), corner wall windows let plenty of natural light in, I like that the kitchen and line are in view.  Community tables had ample space too...and the noise level all around was contained.Our little girl had to use the ladies' room before we left and she got a kick out of the 'hidden' door, disguised with the blending in of the wallpaper.  Bathroom was clean and modern.It was our first visit, but definitely not our last.  Looking forward to our next meal here, and making a stop at the adjoining bakery for take-away treats."
Awesome food every time I come.  The flavor is always there and I haven't been disappointed so far. However they don't take reservations so you always have to wait.  This time I got the Build-your-own Mushroom Goat Burger :)
I wasn't blown away by this place. The service was slow in all aspects from someone taking our drink  order to bringing the check. The food was okay. Ive had a lot better. People seemed to have hyped this place up that's why we stopped in. Doubt I'll come back. Way over priced and not worth it at all.
"As a HUGE Stephanie fan, i was expecting quite a lot from Little Goat. And that's what I found. There was only a 15 minute wait on a Saturday night. We were seated at the communal table which was fine-definitely enough space. Loved the cheesy garlic bread and the grilled cheese. Both were EXTREMELY rich and decadent-didn't even get close to finishing it. The shrimp cocktail was unique in that the shrimp were wrapped in noodles and friend. Not amazing but not bad. The fries were delicious.The prices were reasonable and ambiance was the perfect balance of modern and old school diner.Great job stephanie!!"
"I was here for a special event. It was a champagne pairing brunch. Stephanie created the pairing menu and it was spectacular.  Each course well executed and highlighted the drinks eloquently. And to have such close up, personal time to be with Stephanie in her element was memorable. I was star struck!"
"Little Goat deserves more like a 3.5 star review, but I lean more towards the 3 side. Here's why. I came in last night at 9:00 PM. Knowing very well there will be a wait, I put our name down. They quoted me an hour (at 9:08 PM) and I agreed. They check you in, ask for your phone number, and said they will text you when the table is available. In the meantime, I went to the bar in the adjacent room to have a drink while we wait. We order drinks and wait... and wait... and wait... well, it's now 10:15 and still no text saying the table was ready. I walk over to the hostesses and ask about the status: ""Oh? You never received a text?"" ""Nope. Doesn't look like it."" I have full coverage in the bar so I'm not sure if this was a phone provider issue or their machine is at fault. In either case, this needs to be checked because there could be other folks waiting for a text that will never come. It's all contingent upon a seemingly unreliable computer system and/or if you have AT&T/Verizon/Sprint/T-Mobile, etc. and if you can get proper reception in the restaurant/bar. Anyway, we sit down around 10:20 and I'm starving. We immediately order. We ordered the brandade and belly benedict. I liked the concept of this dish, but personally, I wouldn't order it again. The kimchi was not very fresh and it was sloppily thrown on the platter. I understand this is an upscale diner and perhaps that is part of the kitsch, but it just looked like one jumbled mess and not very appetizing. Moreover, I think there were too many flavors competing against each other... We also ordered the pork belly pancake. The scallion pancake was good as was the house hoisin sauce that covered the pork belly. I thought this was one of the more successful dishes of the night though it still needed some polishing. The pork belly was a bit dry but the sauce saved it! I think there was too much bok choy salad on the pancake overwhelming the ability to eat this like a ""sammich."" Perhaps it was meant to be eaten open face, but you could also wrap the meat and veggies into the pancake and eat it like that. We also ordered a side of the tempura mashed potatoes. Very good! A must-try. The fried pickles and onion rings were also delicious... especially the ranch and curry mayo dipping sauces. Our server was friendly though she seemed quite rushed and not wanting to engage in brief pleasantries (i.e. ""How's everything tasting?""... ""It's very good. I especially like the... "" ""Oh great!"" *runs away*)Overall, I liked the meal, but wasn't leaving with the feeling of ""OMG. I MUST GO BACK!"" I'm not sure why I haven't jumped on the Izard train yet like the rest of Chicago has... I think the food here - and at the Girl and the Goat - are solid, but I think the hype holds more weight than the food."
"You are crazy not to try this spot. Had lunch here and can't wait to go back. The goat chili and nachos were superb. The sloppy Joe (forego the bread, you need to order it on their corn chips, tostada like) was the best ever."
"Very much a diner vibe going on in here from the soda counter to the booth seating. The menu has breakfast 24-hrs a day. Overall this place was a fun vibe, but the food left more to be desired. The pulled pork sandwich is massive and even our waitress proclaimed, I've never finished it (Pro Tip: Mention this to your guests when they are ordering appetizers and side dishes...no one likes to take home a bunch of food). Secondly, when she was boxing up our food, her index and thumb fingers touched the sandwich (sounds small, but in the food industry, this is a big no-no...why do you think all serves get tested for TB?). I had the goat burger which was tasty along with the fried pickles and onion rings. Overall, the diner vibe carries over to the food and you get a lot of grease when ordering. This is a breakfast spot for locals and no more."
"OFFICIALLY OBSESSED.So obsessed that I went here opening night & then 2 times again n less than a week. each time I've gone I got pretty lucky and didn't have to wait for a table any longer than 10-15 minutes. (hopefully i didn't just jinx myself now haha) Each time that I've gone the service has been great and the servers are super friendly & knowledgeable about the massive menu.i love the atmosphere of Little Goat. It's got like a retro/mod diner appeal to it and you can definitely see rustic elements that you would also find while dining at Girl & the Goat. There's something on the menu that can please anyone's palette I believe. Little Goat is kind of like a bourgeosie Denny's haha (& i don't mean that in a bad way, because I love me some ""moons over my hammy"").i would definitely recommend trying the Crab Dip that comes with Ritz crackers, it's so cheesy and gooey and super fatty. just the way i like it. Also would recommend trying the cheesy french bread, especially since they make all of the bread in house. (bread is the reason they opened Little Goat all together after all) First time I went with the bf and tried the Supper Club Fried Chicken. The skin was fried to perfection and the chicken was super moist and tasty. The skin also had a hint of heat to it, like some hot sauce in the seasoning but it was delish. next time I went I ordered the Tonkatsu sammich and it did not dissapoint! I love tonkatsu sandwiches and Little Goat's version was SUPER DELICIOUS. Loved the combination with cabbage and pickled banana peppers. being the fatty that I am I also ordered a side of mac and cheese which was also super tasty. Not overly cheesy and didn't have an overbearing amount of truffle oil either. I tried the tomato apple soup which was also good, but the only comment I would have on that is that I didn't really taste any apple in the soup. Just tasted like tomato, but I finished the whole damn bowl anyway.Ok last trip, tried the dark chocolate chip pancakes. They were massive and a bit more on the savory side as well, not too sweet as they use a sourdough base to the pancake batter. It was accompanied by the barrel wood aged syrup that went really well with the pancakes. A great choice if you have a sweet & savory tooth. Love this place and Stephanie Izard has done an amazing job! You can taste and feel the heart and soul that's been put into this lovely diner! Will most definitely be back for more and probably will try everything on the menu!"
So much fun and delicious! I like the casual communal seating and the wide selection of comfort food.
"My experience at Little Goat on their 3rd day open was a great one. Walked in on a Monday afternoon for brunch. I was told there would be a 90 minute wait, but it only ended up being about 30 minutes. The nice thing is they take your phone number on their ipads and just text you when your table is ready and you can go to the bar/coffee/bread hangout area in the back which makes the wait way less painful. Here's what we ordered:- Asian style kimchi breakfast thing: Good. Pancakes were really buttery. You wouldn't think it would work but it does. Although it was good, I have a feeling it's not their best on their menu.- Scallion pork belly sandwich: Same as the asian style kimchi thing. Good but probably won't order again.- Apple pancake with oatmeal crumble: Delicious. What's special about it is that it seems to have either curry or cumin added. An unexpected surprise. I really loved this but my bf was weirded out by the cuminy taste in a sweet pancake.- Benedict: So fricken amazing. Get it.- Hash browns w/goat cheese: Get it only if you know you like goat cheese. - Crumpets: SO good. Soft and dense on the inside. Delicious.- Service: slow but the server was nice. Given it was only their 3rd day open, she was doing well. The only thing I have to complain about is sitting by the window. Our entire party was BLINDED by the light. Some had to eat with their sunglasses on. Like a boss. Loved the ambiance. Great place to brunch or get coffee/baked goods."
"So hit G& The Goat multiple times over the past 2 years.  Had a great dinner party their with a pile of friends and the large table.  Always been very good.So interested in this place.  This was my second visit which is usually the true tale of a resturaunt.  Place holds up.  Like the dinner experience with the three fold plastic menu, nice job offering the great takes on the usual dinner experience, think Golden Apple but higher end food.  Elivis waffles are great but more like desert, I forgot the name of my sandwich but it's basically a pork cutlet with sarachi.  If you like pork cutlet this is a must have.  Makes most of the ones I have had look sad.  Perfectly cooked, soft and moist inside and perfectly crisp and breaded on the outside.  Would eat that too often if I lived in the West loop.  The back bar is cool but pretty small.  Good cocktails... had a nice one with Mezcal which seems to be on every bars menu now.  Well done cocktails so give them a shot.  Had a cumcuber and gin fiz that would be excellent in the summer.  Food excellent... look forward to working my way through the menuDrinks... rock solidStaff... rock solidAtmosphere... cool trendy take on dinerDesert... meh... the Elvis waffles are not on desert but I would make them desert as they are far better then the regular deserts.   I would go as far as to say skip desertLittle Goat is a knock off the the block ;)"
"I came here with my husband for brunch at about 11 a.m. on a Saturday.  We were informed that there would be a 45 to 60 minute wait.  They took my phone number and said they would text when it was time to come back for a table.  We were able to walk up to Publican Quality Meats and browse around before they texted us to come back.  I really like this texting feature and I hope more restaurants start doing this.  We were seated at the counter.  Our server was very nice and attentive and our water was always refilled before we drank more than half of it.  We ordered coffee and it was very good.  I ordered the smoked corned beef hash, which I would not order again.  The corned beef hash did not have a smoky flavor and was underseasoned.  I asked for my egg to be cooked over easy but they were over hard.  The dish could have benefited from a runny yolk.  It may have been cooked over easy but I saw that it sat under the heat lamp for five minutes or so, so that might  be what transformed the egg into over hard.  We also had the cheese bagel with green bean and cashew ""schmear.""  The bagel and the shmear were both great.  We also walked through the bread cafe area.  I admire how this restaurant carries the ""little goat"" theme through practically everything.  I really wanted to be floored by my meal, but I was underwhelmed.  I will order something else next time."
"Delicious, and fantastic atmosphere, I will definitely be returning."
"First problem: One of their servers gave himself an additional tip despite being left 20% in cash. (Check your receipts, people!)Second problem: For the past two weeks I have been waiting for a call from the manager to get it resolved but to no avail. It is frustrating to know that a highly acclaimed establishment such as this one takes zero ownership of their problems or don't care enough to fix it. Update:  I did email Stephanie about my issue. Soon after she received my message I got a call from the manager and was able to get my money back. I would change my rating for getting it finally corrected, but since I also think the food is mediocre I am keeping it at one star."
"We got the shrimps and grits and the apple cinnamon pancakes. Both were delicious. The pancakes were sweet but not too sweet and the granola was delicious on top. My husband's shrimps and grits were good. Like others, it's not necessarily the food for the four stars but the value. The service was slow and I know it is busy but I like my coffee filled up within ten minutes of it getting empty when I'm having breakfast. Would go again but know who to bring and who not to!"
"I already returned a second time this week and service is still amazing, ambiance great, menu options delectable but food was slightly less impressive this time while still good. I got the cheesy garlic french bread again and came out a little chewy this time. The hot chocolate was really good and the french toast was interesting.. Definitely my favorite late night spot in the city though!"
Delicious upscale diner with great menu and lots of variety! Arnold Palmer was spot on and blueberry pancakes were fantastic... Just the right amount of blueberries adding sweetness & a little tang. You can't forget about the sweet oatmeal crumble on top! The home fries were crisp outside with a soft cheesy center.
"Have grabbed take out many times from the Diner and appreciate the Grab N Goat cooler where sammies and salads are pre made and ready for pick up. When the roast beef Sammie and kale salad weren't available today, was annoyed when I was told that they couldn't be made to order. I could order more expensive versions from the bar and wait for them. Understand how busy they are, still enjoy the food, but disappointed with the customer service today."
"I will start by saying that I live and work in the area.   I have been to essentially all of the restaurants in the area and I frequent many of them.   A recent trip to Little Goat prompted me to post a review.  Part of my job involves entertaining clients for breakfast and/or lunch.  Due to lack of neighborhood options during the week I have been to breakfast at Little Goat about 10 times and a few times for lunch.   Normally my colleagues and I find the food to be generally ok to good (never great).  There is nothing close to healthy on the menu either so everything should taste great due to the amount of fat put into everything.  The last visit to this restaurant will be the last time I go back.  Breakfast for 3 was $70 for 3 dishes with inexpensive ingredients (not steak and eggs) and 3 coffees.  The over-easy eggs on two dishes were completely overcooked and not even runny.  A restaurant that charges these ridiculous prices should be able to turn out an over-easy egg.   I do not understand the rave reviews this restaurant receives on an ongoing basis.  The lunch is also sub par in comparison to most places in the area.   The only bigger rip-off in the area for breakfast is Meli Cafe.   We now go to Johnnies down the street where we can get a well cooked egg for $6.  Skip this place on the weekends too because for the money you can have brunch at Avec, Sepia, The Publican and several other restaurants in the neighborhood that have far better food.   I have also been to Girl and the Goat twice.  It was good but also far overrated.  Try Grace, Maudes, Blackbird, Avec or others for better food."
"When you think of a regular diner you think of cheap food, sticky table tops, dirty silverware, and bad service.  That is NOT the Little Goat.  Instead, its good food in such large quantities even Cheesecake factory would be surprised and really good service.  The menu is HUGE so I think you should review it before going to the restaurant.  I started off with the Hot Crab Dip.  I liked the crab dip, but I did not like the ritz crackers.  I think a crostini would have been better especially since all of their bread items are great.  The Sloppy Goat was superb, it is not your mom's sloppy joe.  It is definitely the must try at this place.  The Los Drowned is huge and delicious and every bite tastes different because there are so many ingredients.  The Apple Pie was weird and had cheese on it.  If you like a thicker crust then go for it, but I won't be ordering that or the Crab Dip again. All in all, this place is a lot of hype! But its delicious.  I think the best time to visit is immediately after work around 5:30 PM.  I have not heard a single person wait more than a minute at that time.  I will revisit the Little Goat, but the food was not good enough for me to wait more than 15 minutes for a table.  We ordered an appetizer, two meals, apple pie, four drinks and the bill was $86.00 which is not ""diner-quality"" prices, but definitely worth the money!"
"And now the diner portion is open! A wonderfully open design with comfortable booth seating, with a mix of warm colors, and a nice long diner counter. There's a lot of natural lighting and a great view of the activity in the kitchen.How's the food? This may be Little Goat, but it's certainly big on taste! I had the kimchee, bacon and egg ""pancake"", inspired by Thai street food (and other similar Asian concepts). It was definitely a tasty combination of flavors and textures, given the bacon and the bean sprouts that were used.  It comes with a little portion of sauce that you can use to add some additional flavor to your preference.If kimchee in the morning isn't quite your thing, other people in my group had the Elvis Waffles, the Croquette Monster and the burrito. All of them smelled great and tasted even better.The diner portion will be open mostly from 7 am to 2 am. Currently they won't be serving sandwiches until later in the day, but that will likely eventually change."
"Having so thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Girl and the Goat, we were thrilled to see Little Goat open across the street. We decided to check it out on a cold Saturday afternoon, which we later discovered was an excellent time to go. Delicious food and a charming atmosphere amounted to a great time at Little Goat. The fare at LG is a wonderful mixture of sandwiches, burgers and breakfast plates. The flavors are serious, as exemplified by the sandwich my girlfriend got: the Los Drowned. This braised beef masterpiece hit on all cylinders. The flavors of the sandwich were complimented by the textural contrast between the crunchy hoagie roll and the tender beef. After sampling some of the Los Drowned, I felt a little let down by my choice: the Korean kilgus goat burger. I decided to try it because I thought the kick would be perfect for a bitingly cold day. Although I was not surprised by how well the meat was cooked, I was expecting a more well-rounded flavor. While I do enjoy kimchee, it simply overpowered this burger. My sister ordered the horseshoe burger, an open-faced burger topped with chili fries. This burger looked difficult to tame and my sister looked a little overwhelmed by all the fries on the plate. Otherwise, she enjoyed it. The food was great, if just a tad bit overpriced, even for this elevated diner concept. We'll be back here again though. We're looking forward to checking out Bread, Little Goat's bakery and coffee bar, which is located on the east wing of the diner."
Delicious food and amazing service. Have not been disappointed a single time went yet.
"Baby goat! Great place! Great atmosphere! Kid-friendly diner with great beer! We started with crab dip which was pretty fantastic. Garlic bread was definitely better than the usual; with an awesome marinara sauce on the side. My tuna melt sandwich was very delicious. Arugula and boiled egg topped it off well. The Los Drowned was amazeballs- melt in your mouth beef brisket. It was so much food that we couldn't finish, but what I do remember was their grilled cheese was literally, the best I've ever had. Oooey and gooey and grilled to perfection. With like two kinds of cheese, I can't wait to have that again... I also can't wait to try the French Toast and all breakfast treats...."
Came in for a tuna sandwhich and got a delicious take on a classic sandwhich. An excellent gourmet experience for a reasonable price. Service was prompt and frequent despite the lunch rush. Highly recommend.
"I'm kinda sad I'm updating this to downgrade stars but I was just so disappointed with my dinner last night. I ordered the parathas burrito again after my amazing experience last time and in a few months they have decided to make the burrito a lot smaller than before and the amount of salad on top was 1/4 of what I got last time (and how do I remember exactly how much was on my plate last time- bc I took a pic which ironically enough was attached to this review). And the bread was so dry and hard, it was a workout cutting through it. Last time I had this meal I recall leaving full and content. This this I was definitely still hungry, not content, and paid just as much as before. No longer recommending the dish. It's not enough to fill and the hard bread made it seem not so fresh."
"We liked it!!crab dip--- no discernable crab texture or visible threads, skip it for $12los drowned----- hubby loved itchickpea kale salad-----oooh, much more exciting than it sounds, there is somet ingredient in this salad (I still haven't identified it yet) that made me want another bite and another bite and another.we both brought half  home for later.   All the food we saw delivered looked thrilling and the whole place smells yummy.The only bummer is the expensive valet parkingGood place"
"A few Saturdays ago we decided to check out Little Goat.  We figured that a late lunch (2:30) would ease the wait.  We were wrong.  We arrived and there was supposedly an hour wait for a table.  However, Little Goat also has communal seating that we were able to snag right away.  We started off with the Hot Crab Dip.  It was super cheesy and there was a lot of crab in the dip.  I was very impressed with the dip. My only complaint is that it was served with Ritz crackers (and not enough) - I think toasted bread or even a different chip would have held up better.For the entrees, I got the Pork Belly pancake and my husband go the Tonkatsu sandwich - sharing of course.  The pork belly pancake was delicious and perfectly seasoned.  The bok choy salad with it gave a nice fresh crunch and crisp to it.  The maple-ginger dressing tied everything together into one dish.  The Tonkatsu was also really good and is a definite repeat. The mayo/bbq dressing on it was perfect and it was really tasty on white bread.  With those, we split the smoked fries which were tasty and the smoke gives it something a little different.The service was good, but they appeared to be a bit understaffed given how busy it was even at 2:30.  Our waiter was friendly but looked a bit frazzled.  At first, he even gave us the wrong check but immediately apologized.  There menu is huge and I can't wait to go back to try more things out!"
"Opening night, we stopped by around 9PM with no wait.  The place was packed, buzzing with energy, and Ms Stephanie Izard herself on the line.   We sat at a communal table, which allowed us to have some great conversation with our fellow diners.  The Korean goat burger had great spice/seasoning balanced with the well lauded Little Goat bun.  Duck banh mi had a nice pickled veg on a just right chewy/crusty baguette.  Chef was kind of enough to snap some pics with the guests, and was able to maintain that bubbly sweet personality even after arriving at 4am to start the day."
"First of all, a caveat: Girl and the Goat is my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I don't know if that gives some bias to LG, or raises the bar for it, but in any case that's a fact.Also, this review is for the ""diner"" part of Little Goat. I use the quotes because I've never had to wait for an hour to be seated at a diner, nor have I ever seen the food items here at any other diner. Yes, diners are known for gargantuan menus, but Asian influences (banh mi, kim chi)? Not so common.ALSO, nothing will ever replace my #1 diner, Merry Ann's in Champaign, a 24 hour diner that's prevented me from many hangovers (and has probably chopped off a few years from my life).But even after all that...Little Goat is pretty incredible.Started off with a cup of the goat chili, which is less chili and more than a cup filled to the brim with delicious ground goat. Easily the best chili I've ever had, with a few spicy/sweet/sour notes kicked in thanks to the toppings. Steph knows her goat.My girlfriend got the goat burger, done buffalo style. I thought it was cool they had loco moco as an option, the rice/hamburger/egg combo found in Hawaiian cuisine. It had just enough blue cheese so that you tasted it without it overpowering the burger, and the meat was juicy without being overly greasy.They were out of what I wanted for my main course, so I went with the pork belly/kim chi benedict. The pork belly was tasty and the kim chi wasn't as overpowering as I thought it would be. A good choice, but part of me wishes that I went for more goat. It's that good.And while I hesitate to call it a true diner, they sure try for it in many ways. The sit down counter, the long window into the kitchen, waitresses in skirts carrying coffee pots, the Heinz bottles on every table, and the cute and colorful laminated menus. It's a wonderful little mish-mash that any diner lover could appreciate.No doubt that I'm coming back, despite a few hiccups that come with every new opening. If you're not afraid of eating goat, and no one should be, get that. I know I will be my next visit."
"My wife and I enjoyed an excellent brunch today at Little Goat; I was really impressed with how smooth everything operated for such a new venue. The space is nice; a large open room with an assortment of seats and windows looking out to Randolph Street. Stephanie Izard was in house and visible in the open kitchen (perhaps the best seats in the house are some bar stools looking directly into the kitchen). About the only knock on the space is tables are a tad small (but manageable) and as the venue will almost always be full (outside of off peak hours) it is a little on the noisy side; there were also lots of families with young children and infants adding to the din. We arrived around 10:20am on a Saturday morning and were promptly seated at one  of the last open two tops; soon afterwards people had to cue for a table (Little Goat is already extremely popular and likely will remain a hot venue for the foreseeable future). The menu rocks; breakfast is served all day and has extremely tasty options that are fit for foodies, but also several dishes that would appeal to those with more vanilla palates. There is a nice mix of savory and sweet options. My biggest problem was that so many dishes called out to me that I was racking my brain trying to choose my entree; I was pleasantly surprised that our server (Bess) already had such good command of the menu as we asked questions with the restaurant being so new and having a vast array of options. You would never know this was a new restaurant; service was friendly and attentive despite a full house and food was delivered fairly promptly. I wound up ordering the Breakfast Spaghetti n' Clams which was outstanding! It was fun having spaghetti for breakfast and it was served topped with clams, bacon, bok choy, parmesan cheese and soaking in a delicious sauce. I was in heaven. While prices run a few bucks higher than your run-of-the-mill diner (most breakfast entrees cost about $12), the quality and creativity makes it well worth the slight upcharge. In addition to breakfast fare there is a lunch menu with various ""sammiches"", salads, burgers (with different meats, breads and fixings to choose from), all sorts of snacks and sides, desserts and even a dinner menu (dubbed Supper Club). Several dishes feature goat such as Goat Shepherd's Pie (with a locally sourced shepherd) and a Sloppy Goat. Much of the food is rich and hearty, but there are some healthy (but nice) options for those watching their weight such as a turkey or veggie burger with sprouts, avocado, tomato and relish with a housemade whole wheat bun. My wife was in more of a lunch mood and ordered one of the sammiches, the Les Drowned: Braised beef with avocado, pickles, onion and spicy mayo served on a hoagie with jus for dipping. The portion was quite large and my wife (who has a hearty appetite) brought home half the sammich for later (if I do not get to it first; I snagged a couple of bites while at the diner and it was outstanding - the braised beef was literally bursting with flavor and the bread and fixings were fresh and delicious as well). She also ordered the smoked fries which were OK, but unlike the entrees nothing special and probably not worth the $5 surcharge.  Beverage wise we opted for coffee which also was quite drinkable, but as with the fries nothing special; the staff did a great job keeping our mugs topped off throughout the meal. Also available are some interesting sounding house sodas, juices and teas but no adult beverages served. With such a great menu and a fun, friendly vibe I would probably be here at least once a week if I lived closer. I would say that after just a single meal it has vaulted to number two on my list of best Chicago brunch options (with North Pond retaining the top spot, at least for now). As such I will definitely be back before too long to try out some of the other dishes that I contemplated ordering... In fact, I think  I am free tomorrow."
"So so good. The things chef Stephanie does are amazing. I've been here three times, every time the food was magic in my mouth. The bar tenders are very friendly and informative as well."
"Having noshed at all other S. Izard locations we finally subjected ourselves to the obscenely long wait at Little Goat. The building is gorgeous! They did a great job renovating the space. Being there I can't even remember what Red Light was like, but those were the hazy days...  Bonus that you don't need to touch a greasy, sneezed on buzzer to wait for your table. They call your filthy, greasy phone instead! We waited at the bar and had some coffee. The bartender was nice enough to offer us a sample of the sriracha cream cheese. Chi-ching! Cheddar coming! He earned another sale of the cream cheese, bread and some cookies. Nice. Our wait was minimal and for two adults with a baby we felt lucky to get a booth bordering the windows on Randolph considering how crowded it was. We ordered a lot of food! Breakfast spaghetti for me, kimchi thingee, soup and bacon for Mr. Man, hash browns and cinnamon roll for us both and juice and coffee to top it off. Everything was really good but nothing was total standout like the chickpea fritters from GATG that I still dream of. Service was great per usual at all Goat venues. I have yet to encounter an unpleasant person! We are hosting a baby shower here soon so I will update my post than. Cheers!"
Thank god for the vegan menu! This was our second time coming here and it was an even better experience! The nachos and cheese fries were DELISH!! I highly recommend them! The veggie burger was the best we've had! The veggie rice was okkkk... More veggies than rice.  The veggie quesadillas were also really good!
"The Bulls-eye french toast was AMAZING and deserves 6 stars for sure. It was a sweet onion brioche eggy in a basket with chicken katsu-style fried chicken on top and this bbq maple syrup and gooseberries --- melted in my mouth. So good. So glad we ordered it.The Los Drowned sandwich was also great, but it had a lot of flavors going on and I'm not sure they were ALL necessary. Could have done without either the pickles or the slaw but I'm also not a huge fan of either of those normally. The meat on it was awesome though - much better than what's normally on a french dip!The broccoli cheese puff was good but not what we expected. It was more like broccoli with cheese sauce and some pastry puffs as a side note. Our waitress was great, friendly and knowledgable and we only waited about 5 minutes (came at about 8:30 on a Monday night)Would love to return and try some more interesting things on their menu!"
Came for dessert this time.  Nothing special. I ordered the cheddar apple pie. There was  no sign or flavor of cheddar anywhere. This pie was dry and the apples had no flavor. We also ordered the orange pie.  Again nothing crave able. I had their version of a Moscow mule. Sad watered down cocktail. Very sour. Finally we took a cinnamon roll home and it was dry. No flavor and the cream cheese icing was mediocre at best. I won't be back.
"Yummy!  I'm so glad I finally got here.  Too bad the roof deck was already closed.So here's the gist.  There are two entrances.  The one on the corner of the building is the entrance to the main dining area.  There's sitting room that fits about 6 people and more for standing.  And don't even think about skipping the photo booth!  The other entrance will take you to the bakery, bar and coffee.  It's a small space, so there's a high chance there will be no room at the bar.  But you can certainly order some good beer and head to the waiting area.Now to the food.  Considering the name of the place, there are quite a few vegetarian and pescetarian options.  And our waiter was very accommodating and full of great suggestions.  The fish tostadas are unbelievable!  The spiced apple pancakes were also pretty good.  Oh, and the breakfast menu is available all day!!  I also hear from our carnivore friends that Fat Elvis Waffles are out of this world.  The bottom line is, Little Goat lives up to the hype."
"Holy goodness, they did it again!I'm a big fan of Girl and the Goat, so I expected to like the Little Goat. I was not let down.I came here for brunch (well, technically breakfast as it was 8am) on a weekend. I was glad I went early. By the time we left around 9:15, the line was out the door and a ton of people were waiting outside on a frosty day. As they don't accept reservations, I guess it's go early or be prepared for the long wait in the cold.The thing I love about this place isn't just that they serve a great brunch with breakfast foods. The thing I love is that they serve a great brunch with breakfast foods that I can't/wouldn't make myself. Any breakfast joint (or even myself) can make an omelette, but I bet you'd be hard pressed to find another place that makes a kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing.As you can guess, I had the kimchee dish, and it was phenomenal. Just the right amount of salty and savory with bacon and a little soy blend dipping sauce on the side. The dish really showcased the kimchee, which tops my list for most original breakfast dish.The hubby ordered the parathas burrito, which was also very good. I liked that it was served on indian flatbread and looked kind of like a hearty pancake stack instead of the traditional breakfast burrito rolled up with eggs inside. As this meal is vegetarian, we ordered a side of bacon to go with it. Yum. The bacon was cooked well, not greasy, and not at all as salty as bacon usually is. And of course, as Little Goat is a diner, we judged them on their coffee. I'm happy to report, it was perfect. Everything from the cute, sunny decor to the servers to the specially made Little Goat plates made to look like classic diner plates were great. I can't wait to head back here to try a sandwich or another tasty breakfast creation."
Little goat never disappoints! Everything is delicious. Recommend the pork belly pancake! And the stacked lamb burger. Great atmosphere and servers.
"So good.  Initially, we were trying to go to the Girl and the Goat but they were closed (too early). However, they recommended their sister resto, Little Goat. A technical manager came into town to meet my client.  After our meeting, we wanted to grab a bite prior to his departure.Such great energy upon walking into this place.  Love the decor, love the location, love the people.I ordered pork belly on a pancake with a small salad on top of it.  Literally melted in my out.  DELICIOUS!!  Along with it, ordered an orange drink and smoked french fries.  I cannot believe I've never eaten there before.  A must try.  If the Little Goat was so good, I can't wait to try Girl and the Goat.."
"We were planning to eat around the block, but the wait was too long, so we stumbled into Little Goat on a Wednesday night. Plus, we all have been wanting to try this place out as well. The restaurant was packed as I expected, but we were still seated right away. We started with the Hot Crab Dip because it seemed popular on Yelp. We all thought it was a bit too salty. They do give you refill on the Ritz crackers, which is nice. I got the Los Drowned and this was pretty good for the most part, but I felt like I expected more. My gf ordered the Pork Belly Pancake and she said it was good. This was probably our favorite dish here. My friend ordered the Goat Almighty Burger and it was huge. It looked amazing, but it ends there. The meat was a bit dry and it just ended up being a regular burger that had a lot of stuff in it. Overall, this place was good, but I expected a lot more from Little Goat. We had really high hopes coming in here based on the reviews and our experience with Girl and the Goat. I will definitely come back in the future to try other things and hopefully update my review!"
"A colleague of mine and super Yelper Laura S. was visiting in town for a conference so we had to start with a business breakfast to get caught up just in case we missed each other with the craziness of conference schedules. Where to go with a fellow foodie for a weekday breakfast? Look no further than Little Goat! I had actually not eaten at the diner yet despite being a huge fan of their bread program and enjoying a beer or two at their bar from time to time. We showed up at 8am to a mostly empty diner. Our service was good and casual and the waitress was great at providing some suggestions and accommodating requests. I had my typical sweet vs. savory debate but decided to go for the pancakes when informed that all of the offerings used a sourdough base and were absolutely delicious. Laura S. kept it easy with the simple goat served with a biscuit (which looked great). The blueberry pancakes were fantastic, the sourdough pancakes were light and fluffy with none of that carb comma that can come after some pancake breakfasts. I absolutely loved the cream cheese butter (the spreads Izard puts out are always bomb!) and the oatmeal crumble topping. I'd love to come back for lunch or dinner and check out some of the sandwich and entree choices but I'll have to say with breakfast offered all day if you're looking for some pancakes for dinner Little Goat might be the place to come!"
"The bull's eye french toast is...awesome..   The perfect mix of everything you want for breakfast but served on the same plate at dinner (when I went).  Just the right portions of everything so that each bite is exactly how it's supposed to be.  I'd describe the look and feel of the restaurant as an upscale-cozy diner.  The waitress said the burgers and the breakfast food are what they do best and strongly recommended my dish.They don't do reservations which is great if you (like me) visit on an impulse and the wait wasn't too bad for a popular place on a Wednesday night.  Only like 20 min.Luckily I got a booth instead of one of the few communal tables.  I guess that'd be cool for lunch but if I'm getting dinner, I want my table."
Perfect way to get Stephanie Izard food in a more affordable and timely manner! Kimchee burger is legit.
"Scrumptious, delicious pork belly/kimchi/brandade/eggs over biscuit.  It's like eggs benedicte on high gear.  The pancakes with kimchi/egg/bacon is all cooked together on the griddle so all ingredients kinda meshed together.  If you prefer your ingredients separate, skip this dish.  Friendly staff who answers all customers' questions patiently."
"If I had to describe my experience here with one word... it would be gluttony.  Between my boyfriend and I, we ordered four dishes and practically licked our plates clean.  We had the Los Drowned sandwich, the Parathas Burrito, tempura mashed potatoes and goat chili cheese fries. I had to practically roll myself out of here! My favorite was definitely my Parathas Burrito! Talk about creativity.  There were so many flavors going on it this dish-- from carb-y comforting paratha as the wrap, salty goat milk cheddar inside to the light, tangy vinaigrette over the top.  It was wonderful-- very filling without being grossly heavy.  I would definitely order this one again! The Los Drowned was out this world too-- super rich and heavy, kind of like a beef stew on bread.  I would recommend a side salad with this one to lighten things up.  The tempura mashed potatoes were nice-- exactly what you would expect it to taste like.  Crispy and light on the outside but smooth and creamy on the inside.  The only thing I was a little underwhelmed by were the goat chili cheese fries-- but even then, I would still eat it again.  The goat chili and the cheese topping were delicious, but the fries were nothing too special and I found them a bit too crunchy.  Next time I would rather get a bowl of the goat chili on it's own! Everything was wonderful, including the service (we were told the wait would be an hour and half and only waited 50 minutes-- good surprise).  A Chicago must-try!"
"The food was fantastic - exactly what I would have expected. The service, however, left a lot to be desired. Our server -JP I believe was his name - was absent at best. I had to wait 10 minutes with an empty glass before being offered a refill and my wife actually had to ask for more water. The food was dropped and then he basically disappeared. The whole time i observed him chatting with other customers at the counter and in the service station. I really expected a lot more from a service standpoint. Fortunately, the food was fantastic and I'll definitely be back. If the service is like this again, though, it will be the last time."
"I really want to like Little Goat more but so far I've had two separate 3 star experiences. Both times I've gone for brunch so if I go back again I'll only be ordering a lunch or dinner entree. Here are my thoughts:Good:* Yummy and spicy Bloody Mary's made with a house kimchee* The Bakery/Bar/Merchandise side of the restaurant where you can have a drink, get a sandwich or purchase some of Stephanie's famous marinades, rubs and breads to bring home.* My friend ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles and let me have a bite- I admit this was pretty amaze.Ok:* The Spanish Omelette I ordered once was ok- some solid flavors but overall way too greasy and too much cheese* The service both times has just been fine- a little slow specifically with drink refillsNot so good:* I love Eggs Benedict but The Little Goat's version is really awful. It's covered in slop, super greasy and no major flavor. The biscuit was great but you could barely get to it without everything on top of it ruining the buttery crispness if it.* The theme here is that they're ok with greasy/fatty/heavy diner food. Don't get me wrong- sometimes I like that but there aren't enough other options (unless you order oatmeal).* The wait- Ok, I realize it's brand new and super popular but expect to wait 45-90 minutes unless you arrive before 10am for brunch. And once you're seated expect another decent wait for your food."
"We've driven past Little Goat Diner many times, and held off on coming because of the 40 minute wait or line out the door. Tuesday night, I came in on a late flight, and we were driving down Randolph, and seeing as it was 10pm, we decided to see if there would finally be no wait-- score! We even found street parking next to it! The ambiance is very trendy; and the set up seems roomy. We sat in a huge booth. Our waitress was really sweet and peppy. There were so many vegetarian options, I was really pleased. And breakfast all day! i felt like I had so many options to choose from. We got the veggie burger with mushroom toppings, side of hashbrowns, and choco taco sundae. The burger was tasty, I loved the toppings. Probably one of the best I've ever had. We also loved the hashbrowns (the potatoes were in spaghetti like strips). And got some of their house habanero-apricot hot sauce--yum. The sundae was good, but after trying the sour cream ice cream (almost had a cream cheese taste), it made me wish it was regular old vanilla ice cream. I must be so boring, haha!"
"Fried Chicken salad  an Korean Burger, YUMMY!!"
"OMFG YUM.My friends and I have wanted to go to Little Goat ever since it opened a couple weeks ago. We finally decided to go last night for dinner. The three of us showed up around 8PM on a Wednesday night and we were told it would be a 45 minute wait. Cool, no big deal. We decided to hang out at the bar and grab some drinks while we waited. The hostess asked one of my friends for his number when he arrived so he could receive updates on how long the wait time would be. I thought this was super cool and convenient. Luckily for us, after 10 minutes of standing at the bar, three seats opened up which we took immediately. We found out that the full menu is served at the bar - WAHOO! So, we didn't have to end up waiting long at all. I ordered the pork belly pancake - amazingness. We also ordered the warm crab dip which I am obsessed with and want to eat it every day of my life. All the bartenders were super nice and very knowledgeable about the menu and the beers on tap. One of them even gave two free chocolate chip cookies at the end of our meal...super, super good.  I will definitely be coming back here for brunch soon - love this place!BTW - The bathrooms are hidden. Seriously."
"It was a cold rainy night.  The only thing that was going to warm my soul was some good comfort food.  Thank god my friend and I had the bright idea of stopping in at Little Goat for a no-frill, stick to your ribs kinda meal.  When we walked in, we had no idea that the diner was separate from the bakery and that meant the menus were also different.  We had gone in with a taste for the shrimp po'boy sandwich, which sadly is available only on the bakery side.  But we didn't let that rain on our parade (HA!)!  We chose to ""rough"" it out and take a seat at the bar, since we were to famished to wait 20 min for a table.Normally, I enjoy sitting at the bar because it offers a different vantage point.  This time, it was an uncomfortable experience.  It was actually really hot and without a proper place to hang my coat, I was a bit miserable.  Live and learn.  Once we were seated, we had a chance to peruse the menu.  It was hard to decide what to order and what to save for next time.  I ended up choosing the grilled cheese with smoked gouda & mont amore cheese . guanciale . smoked tomato.  Though my sandwich was good, I didn't appreciate the fact that the whole underside of it was soggy.  I love a buttery, CRISP grilled cheese, and sadly, this did not deliver.My friend and I also opted to share the smoked BBQ french fries.  We had to send our first batch back, because we barely had any fries.  Just a massive pile of french fry crumbs.  The second batch was better, but I am not a fan of shoe string fries, and for that reason, these left me wanting for more.  I love hearty food, and there were just a few elements that fell short with this diner fare.I'm willing to give Little Goat one more try because I am determined to get my hands on the Shrimp Po'boy.  Until then, I shall let my 3 star rating stand.  Little Goat, you get one more strike, before you're completely out in my book."
"Every time I go here the food is awesome, service is nice and friendly. I enjoy spending my money here."
"I'm kinda over the Izard phenomenon. There. I said it. Hate me all you want. And yes, this review won't make much of a difference considering the constant long line of patrons for seats and the always full Little Goat. But really this place is a little bit overrated! We came here for brunch. Arriving early, our wait was about 20 minutes, which was actually decent, so we went next door for a quick cup of coffee. The ordering and getting your coffee process was so confusing. There were 3-5 employees constantly walking around in between and behind 2 bars facing each other, and none seemed to be doing anything. The space between the bars were narrow, and we had to keep squeezing our way through, also thank to the amount of strollers and people standing around not knowing where to order a coffee. It was a clusterfuck! Ordering a cup of coffee should have not been that hard really. Anyway, our table was ready, so we headed back next door for brunch. Not fancying anything on the menu, I had an oatmeal, side of bacon, and fruit bowl, and he had the Bull Eye's French Toast. Food came out within decent wait, and it was fine. But really, talk about being skimpy! I got 4 small pieces of bacon for $6. They were thin too! The fruit bowl was barely a bowl, it was a small cup that contained probably 4 grapes, 2 pieces of melons, and some blueberry. It was so pathetic looking and soo not worth the price. On top of that, it wasn't as fresh as I hoped. As I bitterly picked out the pieces that were semi-fresh, I felt like I was being punished for being healthy. The oatmeal was good, but a little too sweet. This french toast was decent I thought, but super rich by the end. Easy with the sugar please! The service was fine. Our server was nice. He didn't spend a lot of time with us, but he made some suggestions and small conversation. Also, the amount of marketing for Stephanie Izard is rather overbearing. I get it, she won Top Chef, and her food is good, but with her name stabled on every single thing, I couldn't help but feel like I was being sold into consumerism - follow Stephanie, buy Stephanie's cake, look it's Stephanie's cook book. Meh! Overall, really not up to the hype. But still decent enough for a try!"
"Looooove this place! Separate bar area while you wait is fun. They have beer they have brewed specifically for Little Goat. I waited an hour to be seated when I came in at 8pm on a Thursday. Not too bad but I had a feeling there would be a wait. Did not detract from the overall experience though.When my gf and I got seated we ordered the lump crab cheesy dip with Ritz crackers and ate it quickly. They happily gave us a ritz cracker refill. I ordered the pork shoulder pancake with a side of mac n' cheese and my gf got the trout. Mine was excellent! The pork belly was very savory and salty (good thing) and my mac n' cheese was creamy, gooey, and super cheesy. I had a difficult time ordering b/c everything on the menu looks worth trying. I love the decor and the diner's laid back atmosphere. When you first go into a new restaurant and smell pertentious ppl, it is a big turn off. But not here. Everyone (hostess, wait staff and our waiter) were very nice and friendly. Only thing i'm wondering is how I am going to decide what I get here next time. Yum!!"
"I visited Little Goat for breakfast with the law school girls wanting to love it. And there's enough there to give it a second date but not love at first sight. The kimchi egg bacon pancake asian breakfast just didn't work for me. Hubby validated my opinion from the leftovers I brought home. Now my friend's crispy chicken french toast was amazing and she cleaned her plate. My other friend ... not so much with her brandade benedict, which was heavy on heavy but still better than my kimchi dish. Service was good, although I felt for the waitress in her purple diner get up. The coffee was quality and the space is very cool. Little Goat Bread is adorable and I left with some tasty bakery treats. But maybe I just wasn't hung over enough to appreciate what was clearly a hangover breakfast..."
I come here way too much. I finally got around to trying the tuna melt. Wow. It was the best one I've had. Definitely a unique twist on the tuna melt. Still one of my favorite lunch spots in the city.
"Fantastic!  If you are a little adventurous, for breakfast try...Brandade & Belly...brandade (emulsion of salt cod and olive oil), pork belly, sunny side eggs, biscuit, and kimchi -- yum!"
"Let's be honest. The food is great and the crowds show that. But there lies the problem. The wait system is damn near broken.""You're next"" means you're next. Not 5 deep on the list.""45 minutes"" means 45 not an hour and a half.I don't mind the wait. Its what you get here. What I can't stand is the half guessing that is always wrong.Its a tough spot to deal with hungry upset yuppies on Saturday mornings. I sympathize. But please be honest and not wildly guess.Love your food."
"Wow!  This place is amazing!Everything from the interior design of a classic diner to the whimsical play on classic diner foods really overwhelmed me.  I'm seriously impressed with this place.Taking classic American dishes and elevating them to the next level in a very interesting way.  Our order:Goat Chili cheese fries - I would order the chili again separately.  The fries were shoestring like, and very crispy.Los Drowned - This sandwich alone warrants 5 stars.  I would come back just for this sandwich.Fish tostada - Crispy Fish, Crispy Tostada, refreshing and crispy toppings. Spot on. Korean Lamb burger - Interesting take on a burger.  Very tasty.I can't wait to come back and maybe hit up the rooftop for some after meal late night drinks/snacks."
"Hello ""Little Goat Bread"" my new friend! I went to the opening today and expected things to be a little out of sync but was pleasantly surprised by the helpful and attentive staff.  We placed a large to go order to bring back to the office and it was handled perfectly.  It was a amazing to see Chef Izard in the kitchen making our sandwiches herself!  Everything was fantastic but the stand out for me was the chili with ""pizza poofs"" and the shrimp sandwich which was clean with a hint of heat.  The crispy masa chip was the perfect touch for texture.  Can't wait for the full opening! The Little Goat will give my other favorite, Publican Quality meats a run for their money."
"We went on a Monday, which also happened to be President's Day (and my 30th birthday, bam!) which meant the wait was 45-60 minutes. Oof. So, we got our name on the list and went to Haymarket for a beer while we waited. 55 minutes and two brews later, we were seated at the end of the (only?) communal table with a family and their two kids (who stared at us the entire meal.)Found service to be on the slow side.... it was packed, but still. A little more speed from the bar service and our waiter would have been appreciated. I wanted the bulls eye french toast, but they were out of it (""Busy weekend!"") so I settled for the shrimp and grits, which were really, really tasty. A whole different approach to the classic dish - with brussels sprouts, tomatoes, pistachios, etc. My wife got the chocolate crunch pancakes which were on the dry side. And we split some mac n cheese - which was dang good.When we wanted our pannycakes boxed up, they got thrown away. So the manager asked us to wait a few minutes for a new order.... we did. And took them home. And put them in the fridge. And there they sat. In hindsight, we shouldn't have agreed to the second batch because I doubt we'll eat them. Wasted delicious cakes from batter. Will I go back? Most likely, no..... the wait to get in was too long, the wait once we were in was too long and the wait to get our pancakes was... a wait. The drinks were horribly overpriced ($9 for a beer that you can easily get for $6 elsewhere in the city), but the food is probably worth a visit if you live in the area."
"How this place doesnt have a consolidated 5-star rating beats me.  For the quality and quantity of the food, you cant beat the price.  We moved to Chicago 7 months ago, and I have been here 5 or 6 times.  Favorites include the club, the fish tacos and of course the goat almighty!   Thank god they started taking reservations b/c the wait can be very long depending on the time you go, but thankfully there are plenty of bars nearby!"
"I had a great brunch here!  My hubby and I spent the Tuesday before Thanksgiving downtown and went to Little Goat for brunch the next morning.  I was surprised by how busy it was (although we didn't have to wait), and I can imagine it gets crazy on weekends.  The decor was diner trendy and the service was friendly.  But the real star here was my meal--I got the Parathas Burrito and it was deeeeelicious!  It sounded really unusual, but the waitress recommended it and I'm so glad she did.  It was very flavorful (a little spicy) and very fresh.  My husband ordered the breakfast spaghetti and he liked it a lot (although it wasn't my favorite).  I will definitely be back the next time I come to Chicago."
"Oh man, I got to visit Little Goat Bread on opening day and the soup and sandwich combo I had was outstanding! Great job Little Goat! The roast beef was so rare and perfectly portioned. Combined with the kimchi, it was addictive. I can't wait to try it again and also check out the shrimp sandwich, which I hear is awesome. The tomato apple soup was also hearty and delish.Can't wait to check out the full sized restaurant/diner now that it's open!"
I had a okay  experience at little goat. Me and my mom ordered 4 THINGS AND WE GOT TWO! we ordered a chicken sandwich and a tuna witch  we got both except we did not get our hot apple cider we had to ask 3 times. along with we were presented the check without our fries! So we had to take them home after the fact. i will not be coming back for dinner ill tell you that.Okay now I tried breakfast and it got worse me and my mom ordered coffee it took 40 mins to get 2 cups of coffee. So we left its really disappointing.
"A friend brought me here before heading to the airport.   Very fun place... a great diverse menu with really interesting tastes and combinations.   I had the PARATHAS BURRITO for breakfast, which is indian flatbread, sunny side eggs, avocado-bean salad, chili pepper sauce, sheep's milk cheddar... wow, amazing flavors.   I have a pic of the burrito, I'll try to upload.Really impressed and would love to go back the next time I'm in Chicago."
"I was lucky enough to get an opportunity to try out the Little Goat Dinner before it opened to the public and I'm not sure if I just expected too much or not, but I really wasn't too impressed.I feel that here you're overpaying for ""typical dinner food.""Tomato-Apple Soup - Nothing special, kind of blandMac N' Cheese - Wasn't really impressedKorean Burger - I enjoyed the burgerSmoked Fries - These were really good but don't like that you have to buy them separately and they don't come with your burgerLittle Goat Coffee - This was a great ending to the meal"
"I didn't think Stephanie Izard could possibly do better than Girl & the Goat. I wondered why she would expand her empire when she already did what she did so well. And really, Izard-fare for the diner crowd? Hmmm . . . I just wasn't sure.Alas, I am an idiot. Girl has vision and knows how to implement it. First of all, you WILL have to wait for a table, but you can do so at the adjoining bakery/bread shop/cafe/bar/souvenir shop. The cafe serves Stumptown coffee. The bar serves an array of cocktails that are a bit more frou frou (perhaps more diner-apropos?) than those served at G&TG. The assortment of souvenirs is extensive. And you can even watch the bread people at work behind a pane of glass.Once you're seated in the diner itself, you notice that the menu is huge. HUGE. Thank God everything is ala cart, because you will want to try everything -- and this way, you can pretend you're doing tapas and order a bunch of stuff. Inexplicably, even if you've had a dish a million times before in a dozen other diners, you've never had it like this. Beef ravioli. Doesn't sound like much, but there is nothing simple about the mix of flavors once the sauce hits your tongue, combinations of spices that, for some reason, no one has thought to put together before. Just amazing. Get this. You won't regret it. I will somehow have to convince myself to give another dish a try next time, but I may lose all willpower to do so when I see that beef ravioli on the menu.Oh, Little Goat. I'm already planning my next visit."
"What a cute place... I went here for a breakfast meeting around 8 and the diner was pretty empty.   The service was outstanding and our server was so knowledgeable about the menu.   If I didn't have to go do a full days work I would have chosen one of the heavier dishes to try.  Instead I went with poached eggs, yogurt and toast.  For being a simple order, it was probably one of the best breakfasts I have had.  Delish!  Everything was cooked to perfection and the bread was so fresh.  I will be back to try many of the the other unique items on the menu.On a side note our server was telling us about the private event room they are opening upstairs later this spring and it sounds awesome. I will have to keep it in mind for future events.  I think it would be a good space to do something different."
"Wow. This was a fun place to eat. I love people. I really like food. This place ties it all together with the best of both worlds. Went here for dinner with a friend (1/5) and we were told that there was an hour wait just to sit at the counter. That threw me off a bit but only for a few seconds. (I think the parking situation was more troubling to me than the wait for a seat...valet rules Randolph street). There is so much to see on Randolph that I had no problem with  doing a little bar hopping first. We headed out to explore (have a few drinks) the nearby places for an hour and when the LG was ready for us I received a text on my phone telling me as much. Simple and effective way to be able to walk all over the place while waiting and still not lose our spot. We took a counter seat at the heart of all the action. I would highly recommend this.Food: Spectacular. Wow. Breaded pork tenderloin was great. My buddy got the beef cheek stroganoff. Both of us were blown away. The creativity, texture and flavor were rockin'. Service: These folks were firing on all cylinders. Their e-ticket system went down while we were there but you would not know it. Helpful, knowledgeable and friendly. My buddy recognized the owner/ chef (Top Chef winner from season 4) as she stood in front of us at the counter but he was a bit too shy to say anything...so I did. Chef Stephanie Izard was gracious and warm. It topped off the evening.Ambiance: I can only speak for the counter...It was average to loud. It was all part of the experience and the decision to sit at the counter. It was all good. The place is hipster upscale yet casual. you can dress up or play it down and everyone seems to fit in.Extra: They have a bar connected around back behind (east of) the main dining room. It is a coffee bar/ liquor bar/ merchandise shop. We did not spend any time in there but did notice that from the back wall of this area is a glass wall that lets you watch the bakers working in their bakery. Very cool.Overall: Fantastic. I will be back. I think breakfast is in order next."
"As a diner lover, when a group of friends and I came in Little Goat at 12am, I quite simply wasn't prepared for their food to be as delicious as it was, or for their staff to be so attentive and on top of it. I have to say that what most impressed me about this restaurant was their dedication to having high standards for their food.Here is an example- my boyfriend ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles and a bit into our stay our waiter came to let us know that our cook wasn't quite happy with the way his order had turned out, so he was re-making his waffles and that in the meantime they wanted to give him his choice of another food item on the house. In that act of honestly and generosity they definitely won us over with their customer service and I know that we will be back in the future to enjoy more of their creative meal options."
"First of all, I think that being able to see into the kitchen through the large windows is awesome. Maybe not for the people trying to actually work, but for the curious guest, it was a nice design. This place has a great vibe that makes me think of an old diner that got turned upscale. It has booths and tables, and the completed orders are delivered through a long open window that is in view from the seating area just like you would expect from a little southern diner, but it is decorated very modern and a lot of thought obviously went into the design. The menu has a little bit of everything including breakfast items, a large selection of unique sandwiches and burgers, and larger entrees. It is mostly interesting dishes that I haven't heard of before, or spins on classic dishes that the chef has put their own signature style on. I ended up with a Los Drowned sandwich that consisted of braised beef, avocado, butter case cheese, pickled peppers and onions, and spicy mayo on a hoagie served au jus. I thought the sandwich was delicious. The cheese was my favorite part, but the braised beef was also perfectly done. Even with my amateur palette, I could appreciate the combination of the many ingredients on this sandwich coming together without having one thing overpower another. I also went with the ""fall in a glass"" cocktail which was a whiskey based drink. While I liked everything I had, I think that the prices were really pushing the upper end of what I would pay for this again. It's all á la carte, and a sandwich and side is going to put you around the $20 area for a full meal. The unique creations are what get the extra money from me, but I don't think the individual ingredients themselves were much to write home about. Having a cool menu that features a lot of things that I haven't found anywhere else is what bumps this place up to a 4 star for me. I would skip on the cocktail next time, as it was good but nothing special."
"I may die if I eat here too often. It could be because i was weak and I pretty much order fried-everything. Love the ambience, cute deco and a perfect place for a date or friend catch up. kid friendly too. Food Review:Veggie burger with kimchi: Yum! Burger a little soggy but I like the burger + kimchi comboFish tortadas: It's good but how can you go wrong with fried fish on a fried tortillaOnion rings and Fried pickles: OMG. It's yum! I wanna have it now. Only order if you have a big group though or you will end up with a sort throat like me.Mac n' cheese: It's ok but my dining partner wiped it clean!Will be back to try the breakfast items!"
"We couldn't wait two plus hours for the girl and the goat so we decided to try this.  It's right across the street.  It is a deli type place, with a limited bar. The wait was a bit long so we so opted to sit and eat at the bar. The food is creative, stay away from the mac and cheese.  The pork belly pancake is absolutely amazing.  If you're open minded and keeping away from all the national chains and recognizable restaurants it's a great place to drop in to."
"- Apple Cinnamon pancakes were a dream come true, big helpings. - I saw the patty melt when I left, and almost ordered one to go, because it was fantastic looking. - We had a couple sides of the sausages too, and were not disappointed, you'll have maple and cheddar to choose from!"
Soooo rich.  And the cheese sauce to dip the mound of crispy fries- drool.  The drinks- not so much.
"How is this possible?! I just can't even. If you are broke, but like food too much for your wallet's own good, this is a dream. The recent highbrow-lowbrow trend is really doing it for me. Obviously this is diner food, and obviously it is all amazingly delicious. But everytime I've been, I've also loved the decor, the service, and the cocktail menu -- waiting for a table has always been more pleasant than it has any right to be. One word of advice: Get the biscuit. It'll blow your mind."
"This was my wife and I's standby. It was always there for us!You should give the pancakes and fried chicken a try. It is surprisingly delicious. Another favorite for us is the grits. And if you have a stomach for it, try the nachos.Of course, gastro-intestinal problems always follow a night at Little Goat but it's worth the trouble :)"
"Had a really great experience here from the service to the food. We were seated immediately on a Friday afternnon which was a great way to start off. Our waitress was amazing. I wish I could remember her name so I could give her props. Actually Map Props. Arguably the most infomed waitress I have experienced when it came to the menu. She appeared to know everything and very detailed as well. Everyting we threw at her at least which was quite a bit for a table of three. Now to the food. Yes I got a burger. As you should know by now I may be a bit obssessed. I realize the burger game in Chicago is very fierce but I must admit it was one of the best I have had in a while.  I ordered the beef mushroom burger medium rare and it was cooked perfectly and delicous. Them buns though! So good. And them smoked fries! On point. Not overly smoked, thin and crispy. A new twist on a burger staple that I really appreciated..and as a bonus there were enough for the whole table. I loved having the option of ordereing a burger and my wife being able to order a delicous and unique breakfast, as sometimes we are on different food pages. She had the Asian breakfast and loved it. The coffee was some of the best I have had in a restaurant. I am really looking forward to going back sooner than later. It will be hard to not order the burger again but there were many options that sounded delicous and I would love to try including a goat burger."
Solid breakfast joint...typically a wait on the weekends...not so much on weekdays.  If you are in the West Loop and looking for breakfast this is a solid option
"So happy to have this place as my newest neighbor. I can't wait to return for the sandwiches, and give a more robust review, but for now I will say: wow. These are some good bagels. I'm a fickle NYer too, I don't just toss around compliments when it comes to my favorite bread creation. However, they clearly put a lot of thought and effort into developing the bagels (and the schmears!!) and for that I thank them. The cinnamon raisin with smoked salmon cream cheese was a delightful combo, as was the everything bagel with the goat veggie/cashew concoction. Delicious.Little goat latte was very good, though extremely rich. It's what cookie monster would (now) call a ""sometimes food."" But they have a pretty serious coffee program going on, with Stumptown among their offerings, so I will definitely be back for a caffeine fix. Congrats on the new place, can't wait for the diner!!!"
"This place is very hot right now and very fun because the decor is very cool and it is full of people all the time. Expect to wait about an hour for a table. The menu is huge and I'm sure most things are very good, but I have to say that our experience was actually mixed to bad as far as the food.My wife had the bahn mi, and it was actually terrible. The worst bahn mi we've ever had, to the point of being inedible. It was like they had poured an entire bottle of fish sauce on it, and that was all you could taste, which as you may know, is very good in its proper dose, but basically tastes like rotten fish.On the other hand, my dish was extremely delicious, the pork belly pancake, and I highly recommend it. However, that was not without mishap:  I ordered a breakfast stout, and was brought an IPA instead, yet insistently told, ""sorry, they say this is actually the beer you ordered, I know you expect stout to be dark, so do I, but we have some very unusual beers here!"" Well, I know my beer, and I was pretty certain you will not find a stout that you can see right through, but fine, I drank it anyway.  At the end of the meal I showed him on my phone that I was correct, and at that point he apologized, and then brought me a free sample of the beer I had actually ordered with the check. So, that was a nice touch that saved him from a less than enthusiastic tip.All in all, I hope these are just kinks from a newish restaurant being flooded with patrons that will be worked out.  I can highly recommend the pork belly pancake, and say that I would happily go back again to try some other things on the menu. But watch out for that bahn mi."
"Had really high expectations for Little Goat since it was named best brunch in the city, but it wasnt all it cracked up to be. Went around 10 on a Saturday morning and we got right in, the food was delivered very fast. I got the kimchee omelette pancake with ""asian thingys"", it was just ok, definitely would not order it again. Looking at the price of things on the menu ($6 bacon) not sure if it is worth a trip back."
"Great atmosphere, great service. However, the food was disappointing. We ordered:KALBI BEEF RIBSthai fried rice . beech mushrooms . crispy onionsVEGGIE CHAP CHAEspring onion . asparagus . fennel . tomato . grumpy goat cheese . cashews . mushroomsGRILLED CHEESEgouda & montamore cheese . pork guanciale . smoked tomatoThe ribs were overcooked and over a bed of fried items (rice and onions). It was almost as if they emptied the crumbs out of the frier. The others were ok, just lacked flavor. We probably won't go again unless for the roof top."
"Went to Little Goat the Sunday after it just opened. It was so packed we had to wait just over an hour for our table, but we kept busy in the back bar drinking bloody mary's. The atmosphere is great and they have great drinks. At that point, I think the staff were running around with their heads cut off since they just opened, but our waitress was great and made sure we were taken care of the best she could given we were on a time crunch.I'd definitely like to try this place again!"
"There was a food and wine article stating this place had some of the best fried chicken in America.  My hotel was only a mile away so of course I had to try it.  We ordered a loaded French fry dish, the Los drowned sandwich with a side of cheddar sausage and the fried chicken platter with a biscuit.  First of all the service was great, the place was charming and everything seemed very high quality.  Unfortunately the food was hit and miss.  The loaded French fries were tasty, crispy and piled high with fixings.  The sandwich was serviceable but not memorable.  And last and least the $22 three piece fried chicken was oh so hugely disappointing.  After one bite, all the coating just fell off leaving me with naked chicken with soggy skin......Soggy Frickin Skin.  To its credit, the breast meat was moist with a tang, perhaps from buttermilk.  But I didn't order plain whatever chicken, I ordered fried mother fricken chicken and that was not it.   The side mashed potatoes were creamy and rich, the gravy was just ok (very salty), the cole slaw was refreshing and the biscuit was fantastic; buttery and flaky.  Also the two (hot, super hot) house made hot sauces were truly salvations.  They were fiery and fruity and full of flavor.  They made everything taste better.  So maybe I just ordered wrong.  If I get another chance I would go back and order something else.  I partially blame Food & Wine magazine for this fried chicken misadventure.  They got it wrong, big time."
"It too me a while to get back there for lunch but I finally did and everything was wonderful.  The food was tasty, the atmosphere was wonderful and the servers were so very friendly and helpful.  I will definitely return.  It was a delightful lunch.  My only reason for not giving it five stars is that once again the food did make my stomach do flip flops. In interest of full disclosure I do have a delicate stomach and the entrees have too many ingredients for my digestive tract to handle.  That being said, I'll take my medicine before I go back because I will go back and perhaps with stomach medication I will bump up my review to 5 stars.  I had the breaded whitefish taquitos and my friend had a goat burger and we share their wonderful fries!"
I love this place. The ambiance is great. The food is AMAZING and the price is awesome but the service is TERRIBLE during off peak times.
"Little Goat is a fun casual place to grab a quick meal. The diner has an open and airy feel with great natural light. Prices are reasonable and portions are good sized. Service was quick and attentive. The hot crab dip was a definite winner, make sure to get extra crackers. The burger and Low Drowned sandwich were both tasty options, but I do feel not serving fries or a side with sandwiches is a little cheap. Having to order a $6 side order of smoked fries seems a bit much. The fries are big enough for two luckily, but we did not get any real smokiness from them. After having dinner we are looking forward to trying the breakfast portion of the menu."
"I first walked through the doors of The Little Goat back in January and I really enjoyed the atmosphere while grabbing a quick drink by the kitchen/bar area. I was quite impressed with the decor and I definitely planned a come back visit to taste some of their food. Almost a year later and the place was packed on this Sunday morning! What a great sign! Waiting for a table was definitely worth it. I started off with a goat milk latte which was good, the coffee bar in the adjacent room really makes you want to give away Starbucks forever. I also had the smoked pork and toffee milkshake which was amazing. For breakfast I ordered the Fat Elvis Waffles and they were extremely good, especially the peanut butter-butter, I also had some of the French toast with chicken and that was pretty good as well although very different, and it caught me by surprise with all of the different tastes I got from one bite. My favorite however without any doubt were the smoked maple sausage links! They were so smokey and delicious, I could go there just for that day to day. Best sausage I've ever had. I'm looking forward to going back for some more delicious food and I'm not surprised they are literally crowds lining up out the door to get a table!"
"First time here this morning!Their macchiatos are good - I had 2!  Though would have liked them flavored with either hazelnut or something similar. We ordered the blueberry pancakes - which was enough for me, my friend and her 1 yr. old. Maple sausage links and a fruit cup. Everything that was coming out of the kitchen looked very good! I know it was busy for 8:30 am, but service and food could have been a tad better. Overall - Yummy!"
"It may be called Little, but expect big flavor. I really enjoyed the relaxed and friendly environment of Little Goat. I was worried about the wait since LG does not take reservations, but my friend and I went at 6:30 on a Tuesday and we were seated immediately. Soon after us there looked to be a short wait. Our waitress was super friendly, but not weird friendly. She told us which menu items were most popular and which she enjoyed. I ordered the reuben with smoked fries  -- winner for me. The corned beef was cured perfectly. My friend got the fork pork chop -- he ate it all.My friend said to review the restaurant as a 3, but I'm writing this -- so it is a four. He is a conservative and I'm a liberal -- so you all know I'm correct.Happy Eats,- Jeremy"
"Went for breakfast, there was a wait but seating was efficient even for our group of 6. I had the Indian Flat Bread burrito and it was awesome. My sister had the blueberry pancakes and those were great too.  Topped with a cinnamon crumble she didn't even need to use syrup. The waitress noticed one ache was burnt so before it even came to the table she had them remade and the manager came over to explain and comped the meal. Very professional and friendly staff. I'd definitely go again. They had a couple off-menu specials that sounded great as well. I'd like to go back and see waft else they come up with for specials and try that. Great work Stephani!"
Wonderful selection of interesting sandwiches and other fare. The Los Drowned beef sandwich was fantastic. Service was excellent. The waiter was very attentive but not annoying. Definitely recommend sitting outdoors if you can. It was beautiful. Great place for lunch and worth the small wait time.
"I was with 2 other people on a Friday night, trying to eat in this particular area without reservations. All of the other restaurants were well over 90 minute waits, while little goat was 45. They have a bar in the back that is perfect for waiting. I only had a glass of wine, which was good, so can't comment on their cocktails. They texted me after only 30 minutes, and we were seated in a booth. The decor and food are a very well done theme of upscale diner. Our waiter was pretty good and helped guide us through the menu. I ordered the machos nachos and they were amazing. The prices are much more affordable here than at The Girl & the Goat. Overall experience definitely earns 5 stars and I'll be back to try more of the menu!"
"I was so very amazed by their sandwich called ""Los Drowned"".  Its something like a $13 sandwich, but it is worth every damn penny.  Wow.  I keep telling my husband about it but we have not gotten a chance to get there.  Of course the portion is ridiculous too, so you can probably split it with another.  I -who wasn't even hungry when my friend and I went- managed to eat the entire thing, NOT because I was hungry but because I could not stop eating it it was so delicious."
"I had very high expatiations with all the great things I heard about Little Goat Diner, with that said, what I got was better than average food, at a good price with good service. We went for dinner and started off with the Hot Crab Dip, yes it was good, with lots of crab flavor, but no lump crab in the dish, more like a thickened crab bisque topped with hot bubbly cheese served with Ritz crackers. Now I don't have a problem with the Ritz crackers, but with a in house bakery right in the building I kind of thought they could come up with something more interesting and homemade to dip into this hot dish of crab flavored goodness. The server brought plenty more crackers over to finish the dip without having to ask. I had my eye on the Breakfast Spaghetti, but they were out of one of the ingredients so they could not make it. I had the Springy Shrimp & Pork Belly instead. Basically a conjured up version of shrimp and pork lo mein. Both the pork belly and shrimp in the dish were cooked perfectly tender and juicy with the vegetables in the dish crisp and fresh. My friend had the Kalbi Beef Ribs with Thai fried rice, Beech mushrooms and crispy onions. the Korean style ribs were cook perfectly, again like the other dish, tender and juicy, the fried rice and crispy onions added nothing to the dish except for crunchy texture and making the dish have a appearance of brown on brown, on brown. The Thai fried rice was more like what you would get in the Korean dish dolsot bibimbap, with the rice having a golden brown and crisp texture from the stone bowl it is served in, typically Thai fried rice is more closely prepared to Chinese fried rice, but with Jasmine rice instead of regular long-grain rice, but with that said the dish was still good, just not what we had fabricated in our own heads. All in all a good dinner made more enjoyable with the fine cocktails served at the bar and bottle of wine we had with dinner."
"I would highly recommend Little Goat. Casual yet fun atmosphere. I've already been here 2 or 3 times and have never been disappointed.By far my favorite menu item was the Fried Pickle Sandwich, which I was disappointed to find out was seasonal! One of the best ""sandwiches"" I've ever had. The fish totados are also delicious - good as an appetizer. The mushroom and swiss burger is awesome. Not what you'd typically expect to order at a Diner, but I was very impressed.Next time I want to try Brunch, the menu looks just as good.Remember - no reservations, so be prepared to wait. Usually not more than an hour or an hour and a half. Go to Haymarket down the street if the time of day allows!"
"We are there and the first thing we noticed was the loud noise. Not only was the music turned way up but just the natural crowd noise was substantial. I downloaded a decimal app on my iPhone when the music subsided and recorded 85 to 90 decibels, right at the upper limit recommended by OSHA for a workplace. The waitress was impossible to hear and forget about carrying on a conversation. We ordered burgers, a patty melt for me and the American for my wife. Both were mediocre. My patty melt tasted like it had Big Mac sauce on it. Then there was the sticker shock. 3.25 for a glass of Diet Coke. 70 bucks for two burgers (12 bucks apiece), two Diet Cokes, two glasses of wine and a side of Brussels sprouts. The acoustics problem stems from so many flat or glass surfaces. With the high prices, they should spend some of that dough on sound proofing. Until they do, we won't be back."
Everything that I could say has already been said.  I had the Little Goat equivalent to Eggs Benedict.  The use of brandade instead of hollandaise was GENIUS.  The kimchi made a perfect counterpoint to all of that richness.  The biscuit was so fluffy and delicious.  The cocktails were tasty. I was totally into it.  We sat at the bar--i love watching the short order cooks and how they work together to make a pretty amazing meal.
such a perfect diner with delicious food! My husband loves that he can get breakfast any time of the day. Will def be back! There is usually always a wait but we had a drink at the bar while we waited......yummy cava!
"Cute place but I don't really understand what the long waits are all about.   The menu is a little weird - there were not a lot of healthy options.  I asked if the fish tacos could be made with fish that wasn't fried and the answer was no.  I ordered the kale & chickpea salad with chicken and it was really, really good.  The vinaigrette dressing was packed with flavor.  Our waiter was a nice guy, though he was wearing a knit beanie hat, which I thought was a bit bizarre for a waiter."
Went to the Little Goat for breakfast on a Sunday and it was delicious. The weather was nice so we decided to sit outside.  I suggest making a reservation because the restaurant was definitely busy. I ordered the smoked corned beef hash and had trouble picking which homemade sauce I wanted to use on each bite.  The portions were huge and if we had a place to put the leftovers we definitely would have taken them. I think this place is a great stop for breakfast and is worth the price for breakfast!
"Asian breakfast was absolutely amazing. Oral orgasm. They play with some interesting flavor combos and completely pull it off. Service was great, worth every penny."
"I don't know about you, but I tend to be skeptical of restaurants with rotating mascots. Especially ones that look like goats. BUT Little Goat was a pleasant surprise, and even better, not a single goat option on their menu.  It's a classy little diner in the West End with a nice bar attached to it-- great place to go for drinks or dinner, or lunch, or anytime of the day. Some high points from my visit?The Cocktails-- Fool's Russian was definitely my favorite, similar to a Pim's, a great blend of refreshing cucumber with a vodka twist. Old Tarte, if you're into Old Fashioned. Nachos are a must especially if you're in a big dinner party. Overall, I was impressed and will definitely continue dining there in the future. ALSO, if you're just there for drinks, they have a rooftop open!"
"Great ambience! Not casual. not formal. Great brunch place for hangout over the weekend. I wanted to order everything on the menu. Everything sounded so good. I will definitely return to order the other dishes. I ended up ordering Bull's eye French Toast which is eggs crispy chicken sweet onion brioche  and in bbq maple syrup. The eggs were part of the french toast. I've never quite tasted anything like this and it was delicious. I ordered a bloody mary....or to say a very spicy bloody mary! I would just go back for a glass again. Again, loved it and will go back many more times."
Love this place! Couldn't get into the Girl and the Goat so decided to try the food here and we were pleasantly surprised. There were 3 of us and we shared about 10 different dishes and loved each one. It really is a fun casual place with some communal seating.  It has good energy !
"Amazing place, came here for brunch and all the entrees tasted incredible. The portions are large. Can not wait to come back."
"Mmmm!   Love me some sammiches!  Monday night @ 8pm...table for 3, it was just a 20 minute wait.  That's not bad at all!Glad I was with friends who like to share food....because each dish was huge and decadent!  Shrimp and cheesy grits, fish tostada and BBQ pork sandwich.  For dessert...peppermint Mattie.  It had a bit of a spicy kick!  Great food and atmosphere!  Well priced too!"
Very lovely place. My Fiance is allergic to oil and they were very accommodating!Their stump town coffee is also one of the best. Will definitely be going back to try more more more!!
"I love this place.  I would never come here on a weekend because it's totally cray-cray, but I'll come during the week for lunch.  The first time I went I got the Reuben and tempura mashed potatoes and my hubby got the fat elvis. They are all yummy!  The second time I got the bulls eye french toast (AWESOME!), my daugher got the kids mac and cheese (good), and my husband got the Tonkatsu and smoked Fries (both were just ok).  Overall I will definitely be back, most of the food is awesome and very creative.  The service can be a little hit or miss, the first time it was good the second time our server only came by twice the whole meal.  However, the food is definitely worth the trip."
"I love breakfast food, and I am huge fan of  Top Chef and I rooted for Stephanie Izard  the whole time. I like to find eateries that provide excellent food and if I can get it for a good price all the better. With that said, I am willing to a pay higher price for food if it exceeds my expectations. So, I figured since I was trying food creations from such an accomplished Chef I felt it was important to try something I would normally not try. I do not have a sweet tooth and while reading over the menu options I became intrigued by the Bull's Eye French Toast. I don't typically order french toast because it is easy to make at home. The french toast caught my eye due to the interesting ingredients (eggs . crispy chicken . sweet onion brioche . BBQ maple syrup) I must say despite the sweetness it was quite delicious. The egg that is perfectly cooked with the yolk that once you cut through it, it runs together with the BBQ maple syrup to cut the sweetness and you are left with an amazing mingling of flavors. My friend, ordered  the Asian Shrimp Salad and stated it was quite good. She said that her only complaint was there wasn't more on her plate. We also ordered the biscuits and gravy, and informed the waiter that we wanted to share the dish. We both were very impressed when he brought it to our table as though it was an appetizer. As to my review of the dish.....it was amazing the mushrooms were an added benefit and if you are not a fan of mushrooms, but loves biscuits and gravy I suggest giving it a chance I doubt you will disappointed."
"So happy to have finally tried the Little Goat!!  The menu is definitely a little bit twisted like Girl & The Goat, which is fine by me.Great service, adorably decorated.  No wait for 2pp at 9am if you're willing to do communal seating or the counter (we were).LOVED the tempura mashed potatoes.  Picture 2 card deck-like shapes of mashed potatoes with a very light tempura batter on the outside. There was some sort of sauce on the plate too that was yummy. These were rich and delicious.We ordered the server's recommendations-The bulleye french toast was good, but there was just too much of the syrup, making the dish far too sweet. I LOVE sweet and it was definitely too much for me.  The fried chicken on it was delicious.My friend had the ""burrito"" which she enjoyed.I am dying to go back later in the day so I can try sandwiches and the apps."
Only popped in to try and pick up some bread in the evening and found it to be a hopping place. The main restaurant was jam packed even though it was a Monday and the bread area had transformed into an evening bar. I will definitely be back soon to try out the full menu.
"I came here twice in one week... Terrible diet plan I know.The first time I had the Bull's Eye French Toast and it was great! A little on the sweet side, so I'd reocmmend splitting it with someone and getting something savory as well.The second time I wanted something small, so just had some cheesey grits and a biscuit. I had seen someone get the grist the first time around and just had to go back for them. They were very fluffy and defintely cheesy. The biscuit was square, flaky and good, but it was more like a pastry than a biscuit. I still enjoyed it though.If you're with a group, be ready for a wait. I was alone both times and I wasn't too thrilled with one of the hostesses the 1st time around. I walked in and said I was alone, and she said sure, give me a minute and we can fit you at the counter... So I stood and waited for about 15 minutes. At the point I asked the other hostesss how long the wait was going to be and she handed me some menus and sent me over to the counter right away. SO yeah, I dunno what was going on there, but it was kind of annoying.Otherwise both good experiences.I would go back."
"I've been dying to try this place out for a few weeks now and finally got a chance today with a friend. The first thing we noticed upon walking in was how well decorated the restaurant was -- it has a very laidback diner feel but the quality of the booths and the natural lighting through the skylight gave it a modern, more upscale touch. And can I just say how awesome it is to have coat hooks right next to the booth? Ugh, so convenient.Our waitress while extremely nice did seem quite busy. However, our water glasses were never empty for long or anything. We wanted to try the goat chili cheese fries but she said they had already run out for the day (must be some seriously delicious chili if that's the case). We wound up ordering fried pickles and onions instead as an app. I really loved how hot the appetizer was and how light-tasting the batter was. The two sauces they had with it (tartar, maybe, and some house-made mustard which was SUPER mild) went really well with the pickles and onions. I especially appreciated that they pickled the onions too because I am not a huge huge fan of onion rings. There was a lot of acidity going on in that app though, so if that's not your thing, don't order it.My friend ordered the Los Drowned sandwich which he polished off completely, and I had the Brandade and Belly. I really loved how the flavors and textures of the dish played off each other. I never would've thought brandade + biscuit + pork belly + kimchi would taste good together, but they do. There is a lot of acidity as well, so I didn't finish my food (but I wrapped it up for a snack later!). The brandade was super unique and I really liked the sunny side up eggs. The biscuits were a little dense for my taste, but then again I'm from NC, so. Cute cute diner with some pretty unique food. Everything was cooked perfectly, so no complaints about that! Maybe I'll try something sweet next time."
"This place was PACKED...fortunately I came alone and was seated at the bar within moments. I ordered ""The fat club"" but asked for wheat bread and sauces on the side. The sandwich was HUGE and I fully expected leftovers...there weren't any. I ended up pouring the sauces (house sauce was amazing) and devouring my entire meal along with the half order or smoked fries (which actually weren't all that great)  I would have gone for dessert however prices were steep. My waitress was nice and attentive but overall I thought my meal was too pricey for what it was. I do recommend going at least once though. If I do I will certainly order something else =)"
"I think that reviewing any new restaurant is tricky because even with good planning, you never know which dishes are going to be a hit with patrons...and Little Goat's menu, at this stage, is a bit too large IMHO.That is the driver for my review, because my group of six got about 15 different items on the menu, and it was extremely hit-or-miss.  I personally ordered the fried pickles/onion rings and Machos Nachos (both pretty good, especially the chips in the nachos) plus the biscuits and gravy for dinner (crazy bland) and a chocolate shake for dessert (I get shakes twice a week; this was the worst I have had since moving to Chicago, way too milky with no consistency).  I tasted the sloppy joe sandwich (not bad) and the Los Drowned (very good, maybe the best thing we ordered at the table) and the fries (above average).  One of my friends ordered the brandade & belly benedict and left half of the meal on her plate.As others have mentioned, one thing that can't be disputed are the prices; I thought everything was pretty fair for the portion size and I think only one item on the food menu was more than $20, so it's got that going for it.  The space is cool, the bar is great, and if you don't like waiting in line, the hours allow for getting creative by showing up during off-peak times to slide right in.We had a few disappointed team members in our group after this meal but I'll go back this summer once they smooth out the kinks.  My biggest vote is to shave this menu by at least a third...no one in Chicago can successfully be all things to all people!  (You know you're too flexible when I can check all six boxes on Yelp's ""Good for which meal(s)?"" survey.)"
"Ok love love love love this place. I love that they take ur number down and text u when ur table is ready, bout time. We were seated in about 20 mins on an early sat evening, so that was great! We wanted to get everything, so hard to narrow it down. Hubby got the Los drowned braised beef sandwich- sooooooooo good! And I got the bulls eye French toast- mmmm mmm! We also tried the tempura mashed potatoes and the fried pickles and onion rings. Oh wait and the cinnamon roll. Yeah we over ordered, judge away world, we work out hard for our food!!!  Everything was delicious. I actually think I like little goat a tad bit better than girl and the goat?! I cannot wait to come back!!!!!"
"I can not say enough about this place, so let's get he negative out of the way, since there really isn't much. Parking in the area is HORRIBLE!!!! But it's Chicago, so what do you expect. They have valet, and $11 is more than reasonable. Now, down to the food.Their burger is excellent, and reminds me of a larger version of an In and Out burger ,and I lived in SoCal for five years, so I'm an authority. I don't think I've eaten something bad. Love the Sloppy Goat. Order a side of the cheesy hash browns, and thank me later. Next door, they have a great little coffee shop attached, and a bakery with fresh baked bread. Try the sour dough. The service is top notch, never a bad time. They are friendly, and smile, and attentive. The crowd is a great mix of hipsters, business people, suburban families, and neighborhood peeps. The entire atmosphere is just amazing. Think modern, bright decor, with a throwback diner feel. It's easily one of top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago. They have a good craft beer list as well, so grab a cold one, and eat some comfort food done right!!"
"Show up early and you won't have to wait. Everything is so good here, especially the sandwiches. Great atmosphere for brunch and catching up with a small group. You guys serve Stumptown coffee too? That's great! Sidenote: You guys have kind of a creepy website. Not a bad thing, just an observation."
"Yes there is a wait, especially if you go at peak dining times.  Luckily, I like eating early so my coworkers and I headed for dinner around 430pm.  We were able to find free parking and were seated immediately.  I like the decor: we were seated at a  nice long cushy booth.  The other communal style tables and chairs were nice to look at, but they didn't look too comfortable to actually sit on and eat.  The skylight in the center of the dining space added nice natural lighting (it was a gloomy, sleety day).Our server was very friendly and greeted us immediately.  Once he took our drink orders he disappeared for awhile.  Yes we needed time to review the menu, but the service, despite being friendly, was slow throughout the night, even during non-peak hours.The menu is overwhelming.  There are so many different sections and lots of items in each.  Yes it's an upscale diner, but many of the selections pull from a variety of Asian influences: Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, and Indian, giving twists to traditional diner fare.  The danger here is having too many meh dishes and inconsistencies.  We decided to go family-style for our party of three.  The dishes came out in the following order:Beef Ravioli - amazing!Hand's down the best dish of the eveningAl dente pasta pillows, good for sharing (3-4 large ravioli)Perfectly seasoned beef and sauceTempura Mashed potatoes - goodNice combination of textures from crispy tempura crust surrounded the creamier mashed potatoes; also good for sharingBull's Eye French Toast - mehNothing to write home about; I was kind of caught off-guard with the egg in the center of the french toast (duh me, hence the title).  The fried chicken was a tad overdone.Mac & Cheese - mehGood serving size as a side; nothing memorable about itFried chicken - mehAgain a good dish to share; a little too salty for my tasteAccompanied with mashed potatoes and gravy which were okayWe were going to order 1 entree and 1 side per person, but the server wisely stopped us at 5 dishes.  He also made good recommendations when we were deciding between two items (pork belly pancake vs. beef ravioli due to ease of sharing); although he stated the Bull's Eye was a bestseller but the Fat Elvis was also good (should have gone with the latter).As for drinks - they have a full bar and can make drinks to order in addition to the featured ones on the drink menu.  I tried the one with their homemade apple cucumber soda - it was good to try, not to repeat.  My friend tried a shot of Tito's vodka in the ginger ale - it was a drink with a spicy kick.For desert our server recommended the blood orange meringue pie or the apple pie, but we decided to split the cookie pie which was really disappointing (blah).  No wonder he didn't mention it.  We also tried the smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake.  It was really good!  It was like sipping a bacon-infused vanilla milkshake with toffee bits.Overall it was a pleasant dining experience and worth it to go at least once."
"In one word... Over-hyped. The food was good... but it didn't blow me away. My biggest complaint was the wait... 45 minutes at 2pm on a Saturday. Ridiculous!Then there is the communal seating. Not a fan...The service was quite slow and sloppy too. I asked for my burger medium-well and i got it medium-rare... The friends that I went with agreed that the food, though good, was not worth the communal seating, 45 minute wait and below average service.RATINGS:Burger (Wing Style): 3/5Smoke fries: 3/5Ambiance: 3/5Service: 2/5"
First time at Little Goat and I really liked it.  It takes your typical diner experience to the next level.  Los Drowned was great.  Lots of other stuff on the the menu that I'll be trying on future visits.4 of us went at 11:00 and had no wait....everyone was happy with the food and service.
"Breakfast today was soooo good.  One of my all time most interesting, memorable and tasty breakfasts.Had the brandade over pork belly benedict surrounded by kimchi.  A taste EXPLOSION!  Perfect, melt in my mouth pork belly!Coffee was good but not very hot for some reason.  Other strange things keeping them from 5 stars:  absolutely HIDEOUS shag carpeting that was layered in crumbs, etc.  GAWWWDD!  Please - for the love of God and all that is holy - get rid of this monstrosity!The bathroom I ended up in had a broken toilet paper holder and there was no place for the soap bottle but sitting inside a corner of the sink bowl.Attached at the back of the restaurant space is a full bar which also has a coffee bar.  So, if you end up having to wait for a seat, go back and visit and get a start on your coffee.  We ended up w/free refills once at the table based on our initial coffee purchase at the bar.  Not sure if that's how it's supposed to work but made us happy we didn't have to pay for another coffee at the table."
"Nom nom nom. I've been here twice now and both times loved what I got. The smoked fries are unbelievable though. I would stop in just for an order of those. The staff is well trained, and makes everything on the menu sound amazing. The portion sizes are pretty large. Next time I need to try my best to leave room for dessert!"
"Huge menu with well executed and innovative takes on some classic casual dishes.  Good service, very reasonable pricing given location and Izard branding.Had a salad that was huge and with perfectly cooked shrimp.  The sloppy goat sandwich was good.  Baked beans were fantastic and I will need to figure out how to make them!"
"We came here on a whim. I tried numerous times to get reservations at Girl and The Goat for my mom's visit and failed, so when my friend suggested we go here for brunch I practically laughed at her. But low and behold, we got in and only had a 10 minute wait in which we browsed their bakery and marinade section and also watched a strange couple get it on in the photo booth. You know, typical Saturday stuff.The Bloody Mary here is fantastic - but my 5 year old came out when I saw a beautifully stuffed olive on the drink which I immediately needed to steal from everyone. Is that a 5 year old thing or a middle class woman thing? Either way - I wanted it!We each decided to try a lunch menu item and then split them - to make sure we tried as much as we could. My mom and I are huge Top Chef fans and were more than ecstatic to try some of Stephanie's foods. I ordered the Asian slaw, scallion pancake and pork belly. This was the lightest out of the three we ordered and was probably my favorite although it was really difficult to decide. The portions of everything that we ordered were huge! We had leftovers even after splitting everything. My friend ordered the Avocado BLT which was very good. My mom had the Lo's Drowned with braised beef, avocado, spicy mayo, and au jus sauce - which was basically an amazing version of a French Dip. This dish was so heavy and would have been my absolute favorite if it weren't for that reason.  Overall the food was amazing - particularly for a diner setup but I left stuffed and in need on a nap. This only encourages me to want to try Girl and The Goat.We also got a few muffins and cookies to go. The chocolate chip cookie will never be purchased by me again because I'll end up eating the whole bakery's supply. So dangerous."
"I have been wanting to try this for awhile. Went with a group of 7 people and we were seated in the middle of the restaurant. It was very very loud...not the place to go if you want to talk. I ordered Los Drowned which was good, but the bread on the bottom got a little soggy. Also tried the goat chili cheese fries which were delicious and probably the main reason I would go back."
Have to say this place has some pretty solid food. Ate the breakfast corn beef with eggs and it was delish (but a tad greasy). The corn beef was not a hash but resembled bacon strips. That was different from usual versions of corn beef breakfast dishes I've had. It was great. Would come here again and again.
"There is much to like about this place.  First and foremost, the food is quite good.  The bar area makes a terrific waiting area and they got a great bloody marry.  But, I can't give them a five.  This place serves inventive and well crafted foods based on a diner theme.  That makes it a bit hard to swallow though...  Man I just paid how much for an eggs bennie like thing?  But yeah man that eggs bennie korean thing is crazy good!  Korean peoples, raise your forks and dig in you're going to love it.My hats off to Stephanie Izard while I settle in and let out a notch on my belt.  I'm a fan, but but but...  It could be me, but maybe I'm looking to be blown away by inventive food that I don't know very well.Note of warning.  They use a system that texts you when they are ready to seat you and don't go looking for you unlike Girl & the Goat.  The place can get exceedingly loud and busy, so double check that they have your number down correctly.  Get them to repeat the number to you if they don't offer to do so as a courtesy.  Our hour wait turned into nearly a few hours before we realized what was going on.  Time flies when you're with good company and the bar is working their magic. :)"
"Really great diverse menu but a little underwhelmed with the flavors.  Breakfast ALL DAY, so naturally it scores brownie points with me.  Bread Side is the best side.  Don't miss it. Bread side is a 5 Star, Diner is 3 Star so 4 Stars."
"This is my first review but it was worth it. We loved it here! Great food and service!  Food came fast too for Friday night! We had the tempura mashed potatoes, the bulls eye French toast, and the Los drowned sandwich! All were excellent. Even the Mexican cake we brought home was amazing! Great quality food! They were also kid friendly! Recommend to everyone!"
"Went on a Sunday afternoon around 4 and walked right in. We sat inside in a booth and is was super cozy. I actually wanted to sit on the roof but Stephanie was getting married this weekend and it was closed off for the reception/ cocktail hour!My boyfriend and I split the Los drowned, which is basically Italian beef with a kick. It was awesome. Also got the Korean burger which was also very good. We got the hickory smoked fries which were good as well, but I probably wouldn't get them again. I'm more of a truffle girl. Overall the service, food and atmosphere were above average. There is a lot of variety on menu so I'll definitely be back! Good beer/ cocktail selection as well!"
I was not a huge fan of this place. I got the French toast which was very soggy and seemed undercooked. My friend got the corned beef hash and said it was too salty. But they did have a good selection of beers on draft.
"I am thankful to have friends who are also foodies.  Luckily, they live and work in different parts of the city so I get to explore with them. It was Tuesday night in November, when my friend and fellow Yelper made plans to meet for coffee.  Luckily we changed our plans once meeting up and decided to get food.  She works close to Little Goat so we ventured in to get food and catch up!We walked into Little Goat around 5:30 on a Tuesday afternoon.  The place wasn't too busy so we choose to sit at the counter.  You feel kind of special.  Our server explained the menu to me because it was my first trip to Little Goat.  Luckily, I choose quickly and settled on the Sloppy Goat.  My friend went for the Mac N Cheese and Chili.Our food came quickly which was great.  I kept on getting hungry looking at the food waiting to be taken to the hungry diners.  After some obligitory pictures of our food we dug in.  Seriously, the Sloppy Goat was so good I don't think I will be able to eat another ""sloppy Joe"" again.  My friend created her own chili mac if you will which looked amazing.  I am kind of surprised that it is not on the menu for the cold winter days in Chicago.  I would buy it all the time.Our service was great as well.  I am hoping the next time I head to Little Goat that Stephanie Izzard is around!  I have loved her ever since Top Chef!"
"Just realized I made a mistake and had made an original post for this place and had it confused with The Girl & The Goat. The Girl & The Goat is my FAVORITE! If I ever go back to Chicago, I am eating there again. As a result of going there, we decided to also visit Little Goat. Since we were celebrating two birthdays, we ordered lots of drinks and the Los Drowned, Sloppy Goat, and Garlic Mashed potatoes. The food was good, but maybe since we had dinner at The Girl & The Goat the night before, it just wasn't mind-blowing. I do remember the service was excellent. Our waiter was really friendly, attentive (just the right amount) and brought out a shot and small dessert for our two birthday boys. If looking for a more casual atmosphere but still high quality food, this is the place to go."
"We were out late in the West Loop, hungry, and in need of food.  Went to Au Cheval and they couldn't accomodate our group of 7 so we walked on over to Little Goat!  Place is opened late.  This is a plus.  The service was excellent and the place is set like a 50's dinner, at least that's what I get.  The food options were numerous, so a couple of us decided to split some breakfast and dessert.  I was very impressed!  Wished I was even hungrier.  I will be back to try some more!"
"Nothing not to like! Met college friends here for a Roommate Reunion lunch, and was pleasantly surprised. Not being a fan of Girl and the Goat ( shut up, it's overhyped ), I didn't know what to expect. Upon entering, the place is adorable! Very beautiful, funky place. Love it. We were mistakenly sent up to the roof to find a friend, and it's awesome! We dined on the patio, enjoying the last beautiful days of fall. We had a lot for 3 people...Crab dip- very good, but I am not a fan of Ritz crackers. Crispy shrimp cocktail- my least favorite item. Not much flavor. Los drowned- my sandwich. EXCELLENT. Grilled cheese- I would never order this, anywhere. Even this place couldn't set it apart. BBQ pork sandwich- very good. Mashed potatoes-delishMac and cheese- one of my favorites ever. Fries- goodRoot veggies- I think I had a bite or 2, lost in the shuffle of lard we consumed. Place is always packed for a reason I guess!"
"I took my dad here for a late Fathers Day brunch and neither of us were disappointed. I made a reservation since I heard that it can be busy and I'm glad I made one, there were people coming in and out steadily. The decor was nice, had comfortable chair and it was well lit from the large windows on the side and the sky light.It was 10:15am when we were ordering and we were informed that the whole menu was open to order from. My dad ordered the corned beef hash(even though I told him to live a little) and I ordered the shrimp and pork belly. I was surprised when my food came, it was in a large bowl and I was only able to eat about a quarter of it before becoming full. My server said that I made a great selection and she was correct, there was a nice ratio of vegetables and meat(a lot of places skimp on the meat) and everything tasted fresh. My dad also enjoyed it as well and he said that he also enjoyed his corned beef hash.Another reviewer said to expect to spend about $20-25 per person and she was correct. I cannot wait to try other items on the menu. My only complaint is that it was a tad too loud in the restaurant to try and have a conversation."
Had dinner with a few friends Saturday night. Service was great. I had the pulled pork sandwich. It was delicious and too much for me to eat.
Tasted the Pork Belly Pancake during my visit. Excellent flavors and creative ingredients. Sandwiches also looked tasty. Cannot wait to return.
"My sister and I took my mother here for her birthday last weekend. The best way I can describe the food is upscale diner fare. My sister ordered the Chinese Chicken sandwich, and really liked it. (Similar to a bahn mi) My mother ordered a grilled cheese, and thought it was good too. I ordered the Macho Nachos, and found it to be a little bland. For dessert, we got the s'mores and pecan pie sundaes. Both were good. Unfortunately, our server was not the greatest. She practically ignored us after she brought us our meal. She never stopped by to refill our drinks, (Which means we all had nothing to drink for most of the meal) had to be asked several times to bring to go boxes and just seemed pretty apathetic in general. She is the reason why this review is a 2 star, and not a 3. Service aside, the prices are high for what your get, (Everything is a la carte) and no better than going to a less famous/trendy place. I am not opposed to going back, but will probably not make the effort to go again myself."
"I am a die hard Top Chef fan. When I decided to visit Chicago I wanted to eat at The Girl and the Goat. I checked about 2 months before coming and reservations were 3 months out. So I decided to try her diner across the street, The Little Goat. I was able to eat at TGATG but that is another review. I loved this place. I got there around brunch time and decided to go for savory over sweet. I ordered a Bloody Mary, which was delicious. Was a spicy one but delicious. I ordered the shrimp and grits and was not disappointed. The shrimp was a tad overlooked but still delicious. I thought it went well with the Bloody Mary. The grits were creamy and the broth was to die for. The staff was very attentive and wonderful."
"Little goat has a full-blown vegan menu with no tofu chikin or soy chorizo in sight. Just great food that is just as interestingly thought out as their main menu. Tons of options, just ask!"
"Delicious work in progress!I have been patiently waiting for a friend to be free to go with to this amazing establishment!  Wait was well worth it!  I made my way over on a rainy day just to wash away the city in a cute diner atmosphere.  We took the liberty to avoid the wait and sit at the bar.  This quickly became a bad idea because it was very hot by the kitchen! It was exciting to see all the hussle behind the counter but felt stuffy and a little uncomfortable at the stools after a while.We were very disappointed to know that the shrimp sandwich was only served on the bread side and we had to ""settle"" for something else.  I would say the best decision I ever made was the fried pickle sandwich!!! Every pickle had a tang and tart pickled flavor that married well with the crisp naan, hummus, kale and taziki sauce.  I also had the smoked fries and wished I had opted for the mac n cheese as a side instead.  The fries felt like scraps and when told to the waiter he switched them out for fresh ones that were pretty much long shoe string fries on top of more scrap fries.  I wouldn't recommend them to anyone.  I was eyeing the fish tostadas to my right and the grill cheese to my left....will have to come back for that as well as the shrimp sandwich between 6-6 on the breads side and a tiramissu milkshake!!"
Would have been 5 stars if not for the noise levels. Other than that its well worth the wait. Each dish sound simple but served exquisite and full of flavor.
"I have been here for few family diners and with friends,overall always ok food and service,also i get my coffee and bagel couple times a week here in the mornings ,today i parked in front the restaurant to pick up my coffee and breakfast,the valet guy approved it,i told him i was getting my coffee ..... It took them fairly long to finish my bagel i would say 10-15 minutes,so the bartender at the bar area where i was waiting had to go check on it and the coffee too,i would say busy morning but didn't think much of it as it happens sometimes,as everything came late,i got phone call and decided to finish my bagel at the bar area in the bread/coffee shop not the part of the restaurant,i was on the phone when the valet guy approached to me and said he would have to charge me valet when i leave,mind you he interrupted my phone call and he did not valet park me just approved me to park in front,he said i have been inside for 45 minutes ... When i left i waited for him to come he asked for 12$ he obviously saw i was holding my beverage ,i gave him 20$ already furious ,he asked me how much would i leave in tip,then i freaked ,didn't use bad words but was visibly distressed and told him i would like all of the change because i dont think i should pay at all,his colleague the other valet guy saw this conversation and was visibly on my side ,he even say loud i wouldn't do it to you.... Anyhow as he didn't have change he went inside brought some change gave it to me,as i was leaving he changed his mind and tried to give me back my 20 $ ,i refused and left.... In case the management read this,he is young white guy with beard,he was working around 10 am on 29 Th of October. His rudeness totally ruined my day and my coffee and my breakfast,you should not have guys like this work for you,because i will take my coffee somewhere else from now on,sadly because i do like yours coffee and the vibe inside but it's the whole team that makes one place GREAT!!!!!  And please tell other valet guys if they have to worn somebody that they are parked too long while waiting for their coffee which is rude itself,do not do it while people take phone calls,wait until they get to their car!!! And sometimes get over it!!!"
"Overrated.  Granted I ordered very simply since I had a full day of eating ahead of me, but wasn't really impressed with what I ordered or with the menu in general.  I kept it simple with some fried eggs and a cinnamon roll.  The eggs were good...simple...can't really go wrong with those.  The cinnamon roll was just OK.  For a place with a bread shop attached to it, I thought it would be exceptional.  My friend got a omelet with bbq pulled pork, which was good, but very very heavy.  I did love the latte I got at Little Goat Bread next door while we were waiting for our table.Oh and speaking of waiting, why is it that every restaurant in Chicago has a crazy wait?  I am from NYC, and I find that for the most part locals tend to avoid places with a wait.  I guess the people of Chicago are extremely patient, because there was a decent sized crowd waiting it out.  After about 30 minutes we were seated for brunch.  The restaurant did come outside and offer us samples of their chicken soup bread (tasted like real chicken soup!), which I thought was a nice touch.I realize this restaurant is associated with the uber famous Girl and the Goat across the street, and I'm glad I tried it for that reason.  Other than that though, I don't think it is actual worth the wait."
"I would really give this a 4.5 stars but since I went to the restaurant on day 2, I thought I'd round up.For about $46 which included tax and tip and lunch for 2, we got:1 coffee1 cokeduck confit bahn mi sandwichhorseshoe burger with goat meatbroccoli and cheddar with puff pastryDuck Sandwich - really tasty and the flavors blended really well.  I wish they served it on softer bread though.Horseshoe burger - It 's an open faced sandwich that has goat chilli, fries, cheese on top of the goat burger patty and bread. That was really, really delicious.Broccoli Cheese Puff -  thought this would all be baked together but it was just a puff pastry with broccoli on top with cheese sauce. It tasted okay, nothing special.The service was a bit on the slow side. We came here on a Friday, waited 45 minutes (just went to a bar and they texted us when the table was available), and we waited about 15 minutes for our food to come to the table. Again, this was day 2 of the opening so I'm assuming they were working out kinks.The space was really nice. A nice mesh of old school diner and chic decor.Overall, I'd definitely come back. There are so many different menu options so I would like to give the others a shot."
"Great brunch spot.I had the Fat Elvis waffles and they were delicious.Servers are very helpful should you need recommendations. Fun atmosphere - ""upscale diner"" minus the yuppy factor.They also offer outdoor seating - both on the sidewalk and on the roof.Absolutely worth going to."
"Hard call on this one and I've been here twice. 3.5, but a seeing Stephanie Izard on both occasions, ok.. that warrants the 4!Sunny atmosphere, modern farmhouse decor, service efficient, live action bakery in the back, coffeebar - all makes for a great experience. It makes me want to come here all the time and sit down with a REAL newspaper. I even like the wallpapered wall with the hidden, individual washrooms behind. ... but the food, I'm wavering between ok and good. The menu offers a certain familiarity with a bit of twist. I applaud the risk of mixing diner food with the unexpected. Whether it is slivered bits of pickled peppers and spicy kimchee, indian parantha and of course, integration of goat meat or cheese or milk in your coffee, there it is. Different. Coffee is Stumptown, a very popular roaster from Portland, OR. While I am a huge fan of all things Portland, the coffee was rather sour, bad batch perhaps?Portion size is enough, but feel that alot of what filled me up was the grease, specifically the Monster Croque and hashbrowns. Note to self: do not order again. Everything else is fair game."
Went here for lunch. It's like Girl and The Goat had a baby with a diner. Great food and service. The Reuben was really good and the sweet corn side was one of those dishes I couldn't stop taking a bite of. Our server was very well versed with the menu and offered great suggestion.
"Honestly, just disappointing. There is SO much hype around Girl & The Goat and Little Goat that I was expecting more from both. The prices matched the hype, but not the quality. Their outdoor seating area is really great during spring/summer, so I may go back for a cocktail with friends, but I'll probably opt to eat elsewhere.Go down to the Publican for brunch instead if you're looking for high prices but want better food."
"Absolutely amazing place. To be honest, the wait at 10:45am on a Sunday morning was over an hour, so don't come hungry, or else you'll leave mad. They have an excellent system where you can put your name down and they will text you when your table is ready. There is even a little link in the text that will say home many parties are ahead of you. Excellent planning strategy, especially since La Columbe coffee is two blocks down the street. Grab a coffee and wait it out since there's no room to wait inside. The decor lends to an airy and open diner feel, and the servers' costumes are a modern play on diner style too. Starting off, I definitely recommend the Little Goat coffee, which has chai spices and goat's milk cream. I had the Bulls Eye French Toast, which is made with onion brioche, BBQ maple syrup, yellow tomatoes, and an over easy egg (which is cleverly hidden inside the toast). I did not think that all the flavors would combine so well, but it is neither overly sweet or savory. I also had a side of the cheesy grits, and they were more cheesy than I expected. Not my thing, but even though I didn't like it, I can't say that it was bad. Overall, quite delicious. The menu is so extensive that you will have to go back!"
"IMO, this place is not that good, but it isn't all that terrible.  We ordered the bull's eye French toast and the pork belly pancake.  For the price of these items.... I felt like we got ripped off because it seems like the restaurant tried to hard to justify the price that the dishes we ordered were just edible and we didn't get the feeling of ""yummy...I want to eat this again.""  On top of the not-so-good food, the music was overly loud to the point where it's annoying."
"So great! Came in for dinner on a Monday evening, didn't have to wait to be seated. The waitstaff was very friendly and helpful. I tried the ""Los Drowned"" sandwich, which was delicious. I'd also highly recommend the fried pickles.Also, there is a gluten-free menu available! One of the friends I was eating with ordered the gluten-free version of my sandwich, which was served over chips instead of on bread. Four out of five stars because it's a little bit pricey for diner-style food (that day's ""blue plate special"" was $22). I wouldn't eat here all the time, but definitely worth the splurge once in a while. I can't wait to go back and try some of the other items - everything looked delicious!"
"I saw literally photos of food (or decor) of this place at least one per day for two weeks on my Facebook feed OR instagram.  It became one of restaurants on my list to try out.  Because I am a Korean, their idea of adding Kimchi to some of their food seemed very interesting even though the owner or chef was NOT a korean.My wife and I FINALLY went there this morning, and ordered Korean Burger and Fork Pork Chop.  They both were amazing.  Pork Chop had a very surprising turnout with Kimchi and steamed (or it seems.. def. not grilled) boneless pork.  The taste was simply amazing, the meat was extremely soft.Combination on the Korean Burger was just perfect, too. Can't wait to try more of their food!"
"Went during lunch hours and immediately sat down. The decor is warm and ruggedly upscale, service was extraordinary. Our server was very helpful and friendly. The Caesar salad was jumbled. Loved the tempura anchovies and sourdough croutons, but the cabbage was bitter and something had way too much black pepper. Listen, I love black pepper, but I had the distinct feeling that I had just swallowed a whole peppercorn twice during my meal. Reuben and Los Drowned were both quite good, but the kimchi was overcooked and rubbery. If I went back, the only thing I'd eat again would be the Los Drowned. I was very excited for this place, but the food wasn't worth the hype. Solid, but a little confused. I'll check out Girl and The Goat next time instead."
"It's really 2.5 stars but I felt bad rounding down to 2 so it sneaks up to a faux 3. I've been a few times now, most recently Saturday for a late lunch (after 3:00). Even at this late time to room was mostly full. We were told our party of three would have to wait but in reality a nice super large booth was available immediately and we were seated with no wait. The host was very nice and the room looks great. However we waited 5 minutes before even having water poured and another three to five minutes to have the waiter arrive. Yes, this is a casual spot but I think 10 minutes to be acknowledged is simply too long. The waiter was also very nice but I think it is clear the wait staff is over worked. Basically we needed to wait too long for everything and were never offered refills on our drinks nor had our water glasses refilled. These are just bad lapses in service that drag down the experience. The food is generally fine but not great... It's middle of the road. The Tonkatsu is huge but did not blow us away. Their version of a BLT (with avocado) in fact had almost no avocado but the bacon was good and it's also large. For some odd reason the soak the bread with oil or butter or something that adds nothing but grease and mess. The burgers are average, fries are pretty good. So basically you have three star food with poor but friendly service. Maybe 2 stars is where it should be?Bottom line: not worth the hype but not bad."
"I'm a fan of this place, though Girl and the Goat will still be my first love.  The hot crab dip is probably my favorite on the menu but the shrimp and cheesy grits is a very close second. The shrimp cocktail is a cool twist worth trying.  If you're a veggie there's definitely some options, which my wife thought was ok, but mentioned she probably wouldn't come back. But i on the other hand truly enjoyed it.  I also love the bottled soda selections... very ""old school""  Get the choco taco for dessert.  They don't do reservations but if you have a small group (4 or less) it shouldn't be too bad of a wait.  The servers are great and very helpful are first time there."
"Little Goat's Branade and Belly dish is in my top 5 of all time.  You know it's good when you are enjoying your meal and when this fact dawns on you, you are left speechless.  -Perfect Combination of contrasting textures and flavors-Each aspect of the dish was expertly preparedI would(will) fly to Chicago just to try the other items on their menu.Pure awesomeness"
"So I am the only Chicagoan who has never been to The Girl and The Goat. I am so embarrassed, being a Yelp Elite and all, eeek! Don't worry, I finally have a reservation. So anyway, I thought I would never make it to this place, but my coworker one day was like, let's go for lunch! And we did!We went at 11 on a Tuesday, by 130-1145 it was getting to be pretty crowded, but we got a table right away. It looks like your typical diner, maybe a little nicer:) I had a Green River to drink, haha, those remind me of being a kid. We ordered the fried pickles and onion rings as a side since everything comes a la carte. They were great. Came with homemade ranch too, can't go wrong there! The menu is gimungous. We asked our server for recommendations. I went with one, the Chicken Cordon Blue sammy. It was GIANT when it arrived. Holy cow. It was super delicious though and super messy. The fried chicken on it was super crispy, I like that. I couldn't finish the whole thing. Overall, I liked this place a lot. I can't wait to come back for some bfast!"
"Took a while to get seated, but received a text when table was ready. We sat family style with a family of strangers which was fun. The food was perfectly cooked and the service was great. Can't wait to go again and try something new."
Went Yesterday for the prob 100th time and Loved it The wife and I got the Veggie burgers bcs it was Good Friday.  1st Veggie burger I have EVER had.  Very tasty my wife told me most Veggie burgers don't taste like this though.  Also got the PB & J pie and Wow just Wow it was great.
We came here for a Sunday brunch looking forward to trying some of the specialties. Getting a table was a bit of a problem - we waited for 20 minutes only to be told they forgot to put us in the system. We settled for the shared table and ordered. The cheese garlic french bread with a chunky tomato dip was a delicious start to the meal. I ordered the bullseye french toast that I had heard so much about and loved it. My friends had the Reuben and pulled pork which were solid as well.Might be worth going at an offpeak time but otherwise a great place!
"Late to the game on this one.  A guy I work with is a friend of a friend who has a freind who is a friend of Chef Stephanie. Made a call to get us a walk in seat.  THIS PLACE REALLY IS DIFFERENT AND THE FOOD IS FANTASTIC.  The lovely Camile guided us through goat chili, ramen wrapped shimp, Taco salad and Quail  Everything was super.  Very popular prices.  Hard to find Highland Park Single Malt. Goat Milk Latte--wow--looking forward to returning"
"Great spot. The Reuben was very good but the tempura mashed potatoes were amazing. The people next to me raved about the chili fries. Good vibe, fun menu and worth a trip."
"I was a bit underwhelmed by the Brandade and Pork Belly that I had here two days ago. The pork belly, of course, saved the entire thing. There was a crusty layer of delicious fat that was at least an inch long along the side of the cut. Yummmm.The dish as a whole wasn't that great only because the biscuits were kinda stale and my sunny side egg wasn't...sunny. Also, I'm a huge fan of kimchi, but was disappointed at the fact that the entire entree was covered in it. I realize that kimchi is supposed to stink up your nostrils worst than durian, but this stuff was DANK. I had to scrap it all off to the side to get to the good stuff. All in all though the flavors worked well together and I could see what they were trying to accomplish with the Asian twist.I've gotta say: Everything that Stephanie Izard touches turns to gold. Why else would she have won the 4th season of Top Chef? I may be a little biased in this review because I have a friend that has a friend that is a very close friend of hers. So close, that when I went to Girl and the Goat for my 22nd birthday dinner, she sat down with my party and chatted with us for almost an hour. It was probably one of the most memorable birthdays I've ever had. Its not everyday you get to eat fried oysters with a celebrity chef that you admire. I'm giving Little Goat 4 stars because our server was superb and their patio seating was the perfect spot to be in for an almost fall afternoon."
"Definitely came back here after my last experience and did not leave disappointed. One comment, the drinks are insanely overpriced. I tried the los drowned sandwich this time, which was quite good and huge. I was pretty hungry and could only eat about half of it. In addition, they quoted us a 20 minute wait and we only waited about 5 minutes which was nice."
"Had the smoked corned beef hash, delicious! Hot chocolate was the perfect temperature when it came out. Didn't have to wait for it to cool off.My friend had a little trouble finding parking, hence the 4 stars.Will definitely go again!"
"I'm a fan of Girl and the goat, so how could we not try this place on a cold Sunday afternoon right after the diner had opened? And so we came and tried. However, the diner menu items didn't seem as appealing as the bakery part of the restaurant so we went straight back to the bakery. It was packed. Like the full bar was full of people but the hostess told us we could go upstairs for now since that part was still under ""construction."" And that top part was adorable, white tables and chairs, gleaming light coming through, a nice kitchen where I'm assuming all cooking classes and events will be. The place is just adorbs. Now onto the food, since everyone was raving about the shrimp sandwich, and it looked phenomenal, we had to try it. It was delicious, not the best sandwich I've ever had, but it was certainly tasty. Fresh, huge shrimp, avocado, a tarty cabbage slaw, and masa chips. The only thing I didn't love is the potato bread, it was a little too hearty, I felt like a sourdough would have tasted better, but otherwise, the flavors were truly awesome. My hubby had the goat chilli which I had a taste of and it was yummy, loaded with goat even though I'm not a fan of chilli, he really seemed to enjoy it. I also got the tomato soup with apple in it and it was, and I kid you not, one of the best creamy version of a tomato soup that I've ever had. I couldn't really taste the apple in it, but it was super tasty and the bread that came with it, oh to die for...I think it was their sourdough, you must try it! The atmosphere of the entire place is very cute, I wish the bakery part was a bit bigger with more seating and the diner is fancy, yet casual at the same time. It looked very nice so they did a great job with it. Now if they work on those diner menu items to make them more appealing to yours truly, I'll be back."
"Little Goat, Huge Hit...Yes there is typically a wait -  If standing in the crowded entrance bothers you give them your number, have them text you and take a walk down the street and dazzle at all the restaurants in the area or go into the attached bread shop.  It will be worth the wait.Once your wait is done you'll be treated to the best service you'll ever get in a 'diner'.  There was tons of staff keeping your coffee cup full, giving suggestions, clearing plates and making sure you are happy.The Little Goat from the Coffee Bar was AMAZING!  Double shot of espresso, goats milk and spices that make a complex and tasty drink.  Writing about it makes me want another!The menu has so many choices that look amazing it was hard to order.  We decided to order a mix of breakfast items and share since we hadn't been there before.The Paratha Burrito was a favorite savory item.  It's flavors were reminiscent of a Lyonaise salad with the frise, and egg -  mixed with avocado beans and the flaky paratha added creamy and butter texture that was yummeeee.Couldn't resist ordering a small biscuits and gravy and didn't regret it.  The biscuit was very buttery and tender and I'm sure would be amazing just by itself.  Add the mushroom, pork cream gravy and it was absolutely the best biscuits and gravy I've ever had.  The spiced apple pancakes were okay - better than other places but was dwarfed after the other dishes.  It wasn't a wow - a bit on the doughy side from the apples but the crumble on top added a bit of texture in the best bites I had.  Once I added some of their special Barrel aged Maple syrup the flavor popped.  This syrup is  dark real and so yummy I bought a bottle in the bread shop.  It's limited edition and comes in a nice etched bottle with wax seal.  I hate to open it!  It would be a great gift - let me know if you need my address :)   I've always loved crispy grilled hashbrowns with cheese melted on top.  Little goats hash browns are finely shredded and grilled until crispy on outside and soft on inside.  The goat cheese added some nice flavor but there wasn't much cheese to be found.  Sadly after they cooled a bit the potato flavor wained and the oily flavor dominated.  Eat the hash browns quick while they are still hot and hope you get more cheese.Atmosphere is bustling and loud like a diner should be.  The interior design is a great interpretation of a modern urban diner with comfortable earthy colored leather booths and a long counter  with round chrome pedestal stools in front of an open passthrough to the kitchen.  Only thing that threw me off was the damask wallpaper.  If you showed me a swatch and asked me where would I be likely to find this paper on the walls - I'd say living rooms or formal dining room but I'd never guess little goat diner.   Love the large tables they have which I hope to sit at with a group of friends soon.Left very full, satisfied and smiling.  Can't wait to go back and try more things on the menu - the fried pickle sandwich and fried chicken have my eye so I'll be sure to take a lipitor and enjoy!  Another triumph for Stephanie Izard proving she really is a top chef!  Little Goat Diner is totally worth the drive from the suburbs!"
"I took my wife here for a birthday lunch and it was great. We had to be re-scheduled because the city shut off the water on the block, so we got some special attention which we really appreciated, including a fantastic shrimp cocktail appetizer and a strawberry tart desert.I'm not usually one for shrimp cocktail, but this was pretty fantastic -- the shrimp were wrapped in a crispy fried pastry shell, and then served with a lettuce wrap and sauce. I would never have thought to order them but they were probably my favorite thing we had. The sandwiches were solid as well, and the smoked fries were delicious as well.I really liked how it was a casual diner atmosphere, and yet the food was several notches above what you'd get at a diner, at a price that wasn't too exorbitant."
"I have found myself here several times. However, I do not find the place to be exceptional, it is just close to my house. Girl and the goat is much better. Yesterday I had eggs which came out looking as if they had come from an elementary cafeteria and shoe string hashbrowns... The hashbrowns were good but nothing was more than average. I apparently will keep going to the place but if something better pops up in the neighborhood I won't be disappointed."
all I can say is that this is the best meal I've had in a long time.the brandade and belly was the best version of a Benedict I've ever had. and get the Bloody Mary. incredible.
"Wait time is still a hit or miss here. I came on a Wednesday night at 7pm and there was still a 30 min wait.  That's probably the max time I would wait here. Got the fries, fish tostada, and Fat Elvis waffles. All very good. Normally I'm not a fan of huge menus, because it usually ends up being lots of mediocre-tasting dishes, versus a few really tasty ones. But if anyone were succeed at creating a huge menu that's also tasty, it'd be Stephanie Izard."
One of my favorite spots in the city!   I love their tuna melt sandwich! I take every single friend who come to visit over for a taste of their food.  It's a little crowded (always) but worth the wait.
"Was pleasantly surprised to be told that it would only be a 15 minute wait at around 7:30pm on opening night. Was even more pleasantly surprised to be offered 3 bar seats opened after only 5 minutes of waiting.  It was really cool to sit at the bar facing the kitchen, and seeing Chef Izard working the line. I was impressed with how organized and (relatively) calm the cooks and chefs looked, and the service was great!What an interesting and expansive menu!  It was really tough to choose, but I ordered the Duck Bahn Mi.  The meat and vegetables were excellent, the flavors really meshed. My only issue was with the baguette.  It was a bit tough and crusty for a Bahn Mi roll.  We also had a side of Mac & Cheese, which was good but not great, the cheese was a bit too runny. Given it was opening night, I am inclined to believe that these kinks will be ironed out.  Also, I should note that I really enjoyed the ginger ale, which had a serious kick to it. There are probably a dozen things on the menu that I am excited to try, so I will definitely be back!"
"My friend and I came here for lunch on a trip to Chicago this summer.  As an avid fan of Top Chef, I couldn't visit Chicago without seeing one of Stephanie Izard's restaurants! There was a little bit of a wait so we headed to the Little Goat Rooftop to grab a drink in the meantime.  I thought it was cool that on the way to the bar you pass by an open work station where chefs are busy prepping.  When our table was ready they let us take our drinks from the bar into the diner, which was very nice.  My friend and I ordered the Pork belly pancake and Tonkatsu sandwich to split.  They were both pretty tasty and kind of what I expected of gourmet diner food with an Asian influence.  My only complaint was that the Tonkatsu was a little dry.  The fact that it was huge kind of made up for it though.  The service was great and we left very satisfied.  Hopefully I'll be back one day to try Girl and the Goat!"
"Good... Until the service turned on us over a raw French toast dish...I went here last weekend while visiting my sister for the weekend. We were a party of three, and waited 45 minutes for a table for brunch (on a Sunday), so that was no problem at all.  When we got to our table, we had already scoured the awesome menu (very fun and creative), and got right down to business and ordered.  My sister and her girlfriend each ordered French toast with fried chicken.  I ordered the Elvis waffles.  When we got our food, I was super excited.  My Elvis waffles were awesome, and that peanut butter butter? Amazing.  However, my sister was not quite sure her French toast was cooked thoroughly, so she asked to see her girlfriend's plate of French toast.  Where my sister's toast looked like it had two raw eggs (the whites were still mostly liquid and clear), her girlfriend's toast was cooked medium-well, which was perfect and tasted great.We asked the waitress if she could take a look, and that's when our dining experience started to take a turn.  She told us she wasn't sure if that's how it should look, but it was probably ok.  My sister decided to ask to have it cooked more, and after that, our service at Little Goat got pretty bad.  We saw our waitress one more time (when she brought our bill), and she would walk by our table and try to not look at us. For fifteen minutes.  Another waitress brought the reheated plate of food (it took 15 minutes), and put it down, sarcastically saying, ""here's your WELL DONE French toast...""I was really disappointed in the service.  It should not make you feel bad when you ask to have a raw dish cooked a little more (especially an $18 brunch dish.)"
"The problem with this restaurant is the problem with Chicago dining in General... There is not a single healthy option or way to modify food to become healthier at all. Even the salads are sitting in bowls of cream sauce. I understand that it's a diner and that it's not supposed to be a salad bar, or vegetarian restaurant, but you'd think someone as creative a she would have some reasonably healthy options on the menu. The goat chili is superb though. In all, meh.."
"3.5 stars for Sunday brunch at Little Goat. I thought it was good, but not great. I also think that I didn't order everything that I should have, so if anyone wants to take me here for a re-do I guess I would be obliged. Highlights: Pork and toffee shake-- sweet and smoky, rich. I loved the salty bits of toffee. I don't have a huge sweet tooth so this was a good way for me to try something dessert-y that actually appealed to me. Smoked fries-- absolutely perfect, and the smoke flavor is strong. Don't make the mistake of not saving room for these like I did. Meh: My bull's eye french toast was just alright. The fried chicken on top was delicious, but the underlying brioche and eggs were pretty whatever. I would've liked more syrup, heavier seasoning, or something to make it more than a mound of bland-ish dough. My friend had the boar sloppy joe and we both agreed that it was too salty. It was good, but there wasn't anything special about it. I think he was trying to relive his experience at Longman & Eagle with the sloppy joe, and it didn't happen. The menu is huge, definitely check it out before you go so you can think about what you want! Service was nice and quick. They'll text you when your table's ready, love that."
"The service has gotten way better, food more coordinated and coming out faster, the  wait is much better, it's taking less time. My husband and I go almost every week! We love it!"
"This place is an upscale hip diner. Fatty comfort food made with alot of effort and expertise. I couldn't stop ogling all the food passing by! After much discussion, we decided on shrimp & grits and smoked fries. We put our order in and instantly regretted it. We wanted the french toast & chicken, and the fat elvis waffles, and the biscuits and gravy....just everything. Lucky for us when our food came-- we were overjoyed at how delicious and satisfying it was! The flavor was complex in a mind blowing way. How do they make brussels spouts fit so perfectly with shrimp & grits?! The smoked fries were thinly cut, almost shoe string-  I love how crispy they were. We loved this place so much - we are still talking about it! *best people watching"
"I had brunch here today, and it was phenomenal. I only dock the place a star because it was Sunday and things were crazy and service could have been a little better. I had the French toast with poached egg baked inside of it and fried chicken, all coated in BBQ maple syrup. It's so  indulgent I kind of wanted to get hosed down afterward.  Great atmosphere. Would be super fun with a group so you could share lots of plates."
"Great place. I had the tonkatsu sandwich, breaded pork with mayo, cabbage on white bread. I would only prefer something other than white bread. Otherwise, amazing sandwich. The smoked fries were good but nothing special. Def a place id visit again."
"OMG. I absolutely love this place! I had been wanting to come here for months, but it just never worked out. So when I decided to throw a birthday dinner I knew this would be the perfect spot, and I was right. For starters we had a party of 8 and it's great because they sat us at this huge table so everyone could chat and share their enormous portions of food. They have fantastic drinks and of course a mouthwatering menu. I ordered the pork belly pancake and I'm still dreaming about it. It was cooked to perfection and I could eat 10 more. Everyone else also loved their dishes. The staff was wonderful as well. We arrived at 6:58 for a 7pm reservation and we were sat shortly after. Our waiter was great too! Even with the large party he still separated our checks. I made sure to tip him extra just for that! The restaurant is also super cute. The photo booth in the front is my favorite, plus it takes credit cards. You can also see your pictures online and send them to your friends. At the end of the day Little Goat is now my fave place to eat in Chicago. I highly recommend it, you will NOT be disappointed."
"Loooved the fried pickle sandwich! It was a bit messy to eat (it's less of a sandwich and more of a big pile of yummy ingredients on pita bread) but it was oh-so-delicious. And although I don't have any dietary restrictions, one of my friends was very impressed with the separate gluten-free menu. Service was prompt and attentive as well. I enjoyed the decor, which definitely had a diner feel, but not in a tacky or overdone way. Bonus points for the photo booth at the front, which provided some entertainment during our 45-minute wait!"
"A bit on the spendy side for a diner, but definitely something to partake in. The wife and I love the bread/coffee shop that it attached. You can skip the wait for the diner and get a great sandwich and some well prepared coffee from Stumptown. For the diner, the servers were very friendly and accommodating when we brought our baby here. The smoked fries were delish!"
"She may have to be named the Golden  Girl & the Goat. Everything Izard seems to put her name on turns out to be spectacular. This being said, the diner has not even opened yet!!  Had the egg salad sandwich & the tomatoe apple soup. Ok, sounds classic enough, nothing too fancy...flavors bursting in your mouth. Go...don't make any excuses & just go! The decor is phenomenal too. She is truly making a brand for herself & Chicago is embracing it!!"
"I've been dying to go here especially since I've been to The Girl and the Goat twice already. Their menu is awesome, and needless to say, the food is awesome! Their cheesy hashbrowns are probably the best I've ever had. What I loved most about my first visit was the staff. They really go above and beyond for their customers, more than your typical diner. Can't wait to come back!"
"Great food, atmosphere, service and location.  No mediocrity here.  If you love food, I mean REALLY love food, you will love Little Goat.  There is such special care to the mix of flavors and textures in each dish and drink here that it will quickly become your favorite diner in the city.  The Korean style goat burger comes on a chewy, soft roll that is perfectly adept at sopping up the gold gushing out of the perfectly cooked sunny side egg perched on top of bacon slices hiding a mound of kimchi nestled on a juicy goat patty.  You can choose your sides here, so if you go for that burger, get the tempura fried mashed potatoes for an umami overload - in a heavenly way."
"Variations of pancakes with different dishes-- pork belly, kim chi, etc was a delicious new twist on flavors. However, my friend and I got the hash browns and it tasted like burnt oil. Not even like cooking oil, but possibly oil to put in your gas tank, it was that strange of a taste. We asked the waitress about the taste, and she said that is just how it tastes because the hash browns are done one after another on the grill and the oil builds up. We could not eat more than 3/4 of it because the aftertaste (and during-taste) was that bad. Unfortunately, there was no offer to change it out for a different dish. In the future, I would recommend asking customers if they would like to change a dish out if they appear unsatisfied with it.Nice concept, just needs to be executed with a little more attention to the customer's point of view."
"Like Girl and the Goat, this place is a bit overrated. Often, the wait is way too long because of its association with Girl and the Goat. There are plenty of good places around it that you can visit if the wait is long. With that said, it's not bad. It has above average diner food with above average prices."
"I've been here twice now. The first time was fine. Nothing mind-blowing, but serviceable. I ordered the Los Drowned. I was just here last night, however, and the experience kind of sucked. I'll list my complaints in chronological order:1. I tried ordering the Off Color Scurry, and they're out. 2. The music was really loud. I liked the selection, but I visited with my husband and my 60-something parents and it was hard for us to have a conversation. 3. There didn't seem to be a lot of servers given the large crown. My husband waited a good 15 minutes for his water to be refilled. The rest of the table waited about 15-20 minutes to receive drinks.4. Two of the entrees ordered were supposed to come with mashed potatoes. However, the kitchen was out of mashed potatoes.5. I ordered the cheesecake for dessert. I was unpleasantly surprised when I took a bite and found that it was goat cheesecake. It doesn't specify that  goat cheese is used on the menu, which seems like a pretty egregious omission. I sent it back.I was a huge fan of Stephanie Izard during her season of ""Top Chef,"" and she's probably by all-time favorite winner of the show. But all in all, this place seriously does not live up to the hype. I have no plans to return."
"When I visited Chicago last summer, I ate here two days in a row despite abundance of foodie options in this city. I tried the Sloppy Goat which was simply amazing and blew my expectations out of the water. Everything tastes as good as it looks. To me the quality of drinks is just as important as the freshness of the food to rate a restaurant ""as good as it gets"". For years I've been on a hunt for the ideal bloody mary. Mike, the bartender, nailed it! I was extremely impressed with the way he balances conversation with his guests at the bar without compromising his mixology skills while crafting specialty cocktails. I haven't had a bloody mary ever since, and will have to visit Chicago very soon because someone's getting thirsty..."
I've been to Little Goat several times now. Absolutely love it!! Awesome get together place to meet for brunch. Drinks at the bar are pretty good as well. Wish wait time was shorter though. But it is worth waiting!
"I completely forgot to write this review in May!  I went to Little Goat twice in two weeks: 1 for a going away lunch my supervisor took me out for, and then I took my Dad for lunch when he came to visit me for my graduation.  Both times were delicious!  The first time I had Los Drowned and it was mouth watering!  The second time I wasn't feeling well that day, so I just had a cup of the chili, but it was really delicious.  my Dad had the sloppy goat--it was good, I thought it'd be different, not sure how, but just different.  It needed something I felt.There was only a small wait the first time and we got right in the second time.  The waitstaff was nice, but the second time it felt like we had to wait quite awhile to order which was kind of annoying because there weren't that many people there.  That's why I docked a star.  Otherwise, it was a great dining experience!  Hopefully at some point I can actually get into Girl and the Goat..."
"This place was AWESOME!!!We ordered the chili cheese fries, los drowned, sloppy joe, and the blueberry pie with goat cheese gelato.The service is ON POINT! Our waitress was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and most importantly, came by to check on us throughout the dinner (our glasses were NEVER empty!). We came by on a weekday around 5:30pm and were very lucky to find free street parking on a side street and were seated without a wait. The chili cheese fries are out of this world! The goat chili is very good. The goat flavor is not overwhelming. They did a VERY good job preparing the goat meat. My boyfriend ordered the sloppy goat. Again, very good. It is a mixture of goat meat and beef so the taste is not very strong, but you can definitely taste the goat. It comes on a warm butternut squash roll, which adds some sweetness to the dish. I ordered the los drowned. The beef was tender and probably one of the best beef sandwiches I've had! The picked cabbage complimented the sandwich well and i absolutely loved the flavor of the au jus sauce that came with the sandwich. For dessert, we tried the blueberry pie. Its good, but the goat cheese gelato was a little too over powering. I guess, if you like goat cheese, this dessert if for you. In the future, I'd probably opt for another dessert if they didn't have another flavor gelato or ice cream. Overall, the food was excellent. The service was GREAT! A must try. Will have to go back in the future!"
Yummy. The only con was that it was busy and loud. But that is a sign of a good restaurant. Got the veggie burger Korean style. The others in my party either got a burger or the ribs. Sides are a la cart and the serving of fries i got was humongous. Everybody cleaned out their plates. Good selection of craft beer. My cocktail was tiny but was pretty strong. Service was very good. I will visit again when next I am in Chicago.
Is there a negative star rating?!?!!We showed up on a Monday night...Arrived and seat at 9:15...We left at 9:35...We left because in that 20 minutes...not a single person came to our table.No water...No drink orders...Not a single person...We walked over to DRAGONFLY...We sat had apps and rinks within minutes!!
"If drinking craft cocktails on a hot summer day underneath a massive rotating goat sign is wrong, I don't wanna be right.The roof bar was everything you could hope for in a rooftop - comfortable couch seating, bar staff knocking down drinks with the customers, watermelon based booze, and everyone just generally having a great time. It's small, reminds me of a casual summer get together on the roof deck of a condo, but the giant goat reminds that yes, you are at a restaurant by the Top Chef herself.The food is simply amazing - it's stuff you've seen before: giant sandwiches, pancakes, cinnamon buns, nachos, but simply the best versions of those dishes that you've ever seen or eaten.We happened to get sat right at the pass (where the food goes from kitchen to table) and we not only got to see almost every dish on the menu pass by (I have never gotten so hungry waiting for MY food before), but we got to see the kitchen in action. It was like watching a cooking show on the Food Network, but live. Watching the kitchen peeps hustle and flow was almost as enjoyable as the phenomenal Los Drowned Sandwich we ordered. It was a french dip sandwich at it's core, but Stephanie Izzard-ded to a new level (what the HELL do they put in that au jus!?) - undeniably the best french dip I've ever eaten and in the running for my Top 5 Sandwiches of All Time. You need to go here."
"Been here twice now. Both times the portions were enough to take half, if not more, home.Great and thoughtful bar and beer selection - unique for a ""diner"".Been there twice on weekends for dinner - a 15 minute wait is a blessing. The bar is a fine place to wait it out. Only local options on tap.Every bite is great, but of course, very indulgent. Order less than you normally would unless you want leftovers for tomorrow.Service is acceptable for the volume - nothing special, but nothing that detracts. Obviously with this rating, the food was outstanding, and I'd go back every chance I could."
"Split 1/2 each of the BBQ Pork sandwich and the scallion pancake pork belly sandwich and each were inventive, interesting and delicious.  They both combined sweet, savory with textures and neither were the same from the first bite to the last.  Delicious.  I wished each had a little more pork and that would really be my only comment.  The BBQ pork sandwich had a little too much bread to filling for my liking.  I will be back to try more.  It's a terrific menu with great service and a fun vibe."
"I like all my diners to have full liquor licenses... but then again, I think Target should have a bar.Little Goat is very well done, and the Coffee Bar is tits!"
"My boyfriend and I visited Little Goat on New Years Day 2014 after staying downtown in the loop. We sat at the counter (highly recommended). We watched the food coming out of the kitchen and chatted with the other customers seated by us, while enjoying bloody marys (the cream cheese stuffed olive was AMAZING). The food was AWESOME and was presented beautifully. The dishes all had slight twists and variations that made them interesting and delicious. Greg wasn't impressed with their pork belly, but enjoyed his omelete of the day (BBQ pork). The hash browns were also excellent. I loved the ambiance and crowd. We will definitely go back when we are in Chicago."
"Little goat is awesome. Best gluten free pancakes I've ever had, actually the best pancakes I've ever had period. The kale chickpea salad is phenomenal. The goat milk latte is delish!! Def gonna be a regular here. My only complaint is that the service isn't great."
Cool place but the food is not that good. I think they are trying to do too many types of cuisines while not really good at any of them.
"This joint is inventive, which is why I'm giving it 4 stars. I ordered their chapati which was really heavy and greasy but it was very delicious. It came with eggs and salad. I wish they had put more salad on it though. My friend ordered the kimchi burger which she was not a big fan of. I enjoyed their coffee and server was very attentive. Watch out, the menu is really big and here are so many options to choose from!"
"Unable to snag reservations at Girl and the Goat, I ""settled"" for brunch at Little Goat on a recent trip to Chicago. The place was swamped, but there still was no wait for a 2-top on Monday at noon.Major props to the Little Goat staff; everyone from hosts to baristas were friendly and helpful. We started with a couple cocktails which, while tasty, were scantly portioned and thus overpriced. Drinking a craft brew or excellent Stumptown coffee is a better bet here.Our food offered memorable flavors, ample portions, and deft execution. Fried pickles and onion rings melted in the mouth with an airy texture and light crispness, pairing beautifully with accompanying curry mayo and house ranch. The pork belly pancake could've used more scallions, but was nonetheless intensely flavored with bitter bok choy slaw, crisp-tender pork belly, and hoisin sauce tying everything together. My bulls-eye French toast tasted revelatory, balancing the sweetness of strawberries and smoky barbecue syrup with eggy brioche, crispy fried chicken, and rich, runny eggs. The dish brought an ideal combination of sweet-savory flavors and textures.The damage per plate was reasonable given the quantity and quality; I saw nothing over $20 on the menu. The atmosphere furthermore deserves a mention, low-fuss but very chic. The next door bakery/bar/coffee shop is a nice touch with plenty of tempting baked/caffeinated options. Finally, we actually saw Top Chef Stephanie upstairs; it's refreshing to see a celebrity chef actually overseeing her operation.Little Goat exceeded the considerable hype Stephanie Izard's restaurants have been getting. The diverse menu, exceedingly friendly service, cool concept, and non-prohibitive pricing should appeal to most diners. Little Goat has reinforced Chicago's dining prowess and earned a revisit next time I'm in town."
"As a fan of Top Chef and winner Stephanie Izard I was excited to try her restaurant while in Chicago. I was not able to make it to The Girl and the Goat, but we did make it to Little Goat for lunch on a weekday. Since we were on vacation we were able to eat during none rush hours. As expected the service was excellent. We, while honestly this was mostly me, took a long time deciding what to order. The waiter was helpful and was knowledgeable about the menu. Little Goat mixes the classic dinner idea with modern cuisine in both décor and food. Which was why it took a long time to look over the menu as there were many interesting options that you will not find else where. They do have some more basic items in case you are with some one with less adventurous tastes. I would normally say boring, but even basic items seemed to be done well based on our observation of other tables.  And the food lived up to the hype. I tried the tempura mashed potatoes starter based on the other reviews. They were ridiculously good and unexpected. We also had the pork belly pancake and a pork sandwich. The sandwich was good, but very messy and due to the coleslaw did not hold up as leftovers. The pork belly was awesome, and did not make it to be leftovers as it was gone very quickly. The meat was a bit fatty, but in this case it worked. They also had a cocktail list. The main part of the restaurant is a diner, but they have a bar/coffee bar/bakery attached. Good to stop by after or before if you have a wait. The peanut butter sandwich cookies were recommended by our waiter, and man was he right that we needed to try them. We were full after lunch but grabbed a couple for the train."
I was very excited to try this place out after eating at The chef's other restaurant. Okie that you can make a reservation now and that the wait is short. It seems very kid and family friendly. My food was good but not as great as I expected. Very disappointed in the vegetarian selections. Overall okay.
"From what the waitress was describing things, this place is ""Girl and the Goat"" for poor people. Aint no shame in my game, call me po'! The place was pretty busy as expected so we sat at the ""communal table"". This was the table that the hostess offered to us after we sulked our faces when informed that the waiting time was 45-minutes. There were several people already on the table, but there were seats at the end of it, which we parked our behinds in. The ambience and energy of the place was awesome and I was super-excited to try out the place for the first time. We ordered the cheeseburger, fries, fish tostadas and the burrito. The cheeseburger was cooked a perfect medium, the lettuce and tomato were fresh. The fish tostadas could have been better -- it had a nice crisp shell and the battered shrimp was somewhat unseasoned.... it was OK. The burrito was excellent, even though it didn't really look like a burrito at all. I was intrigued by the fried pickle sandwich, but I had to pull a Chris Rock when I saw it was $10... ""Ten dollahs? Good lawd thats a whole lotta money!"", in which the waitress replied, its the cheapest sammich on the menu. Hmm, true.BATHROOM REVIEW: Except for the sign hovering above, there would have been no way of finding the bathroom. It blended with the wall completely and the only thing that stood out was the door handle. Once you open the door, you'll find 6-private single stall bathrooms. The men's bathroom was nice and spacious. It was super clean, and they had one of those blowers -- not the Dyson once, but one of those ultra clean microban type ones. Surprisingly, the mens single stall bathroom was bigger than the women's, which I always thought was always the opposite. Anywho, sit or squat? Sit, read a newspaper, and let the good times roll as its a single bathroom, the place is noisy, and no one will hear the tunes that come out of your body, or the smell, as there's two doors of defense before you get to the dining room."
"i have been wanting to try little goat ever since i fell in love with their adorable little goat symbol. he is TOO FREAKIN' CUTE! anyways, i fell in love even more after seeing their amazing menu! i literally wish i could just order everything on it. luckily i live two blocks away so that will be possible! since i had already eaten breakfast and it was noon, i had the veggie quesadilla because i honestly couldn't decide on a sandwich. it was THE BEST quesdilla i have ever had! to me, no meat/all veggie options are usually not as fulfilling, but this one was loaded! broccoli, mushrooms, peppers, cheese, more cheese on top, beans, avocado, jalepenos who knows what else.. and the flour tortilla wasn't just your average floppy tortilla, it held its shape and made eating the meal really easy! my fiancee had the bullseye french toast which was an awesome version topped with fried chicken, strawberries, and bbq maple syrup.PLUS they have a little gift shop over in the bakery part with little goat apparel and fun little items so i left extremely satisfied with a fridge magnet and a bandana! i can't wait to come back!! :D"
"My husband and I were moving to DC from Chicago and and wanted to do as much Chicago as we could before we left. Of course we had to hit up Randolph Street one last time! So decided to go casual and hit up Little Goat. A place a few of my friends have been raving about!I had the Patty Melt with goat. It was DELICIOUS!!! I usually don't like patty melts but something about this was just calling my name. The pretzel rye was great! It took out some of the ryenss, if that makes sense. The carmalized onions and cheese were perfectly melted together. It was a great choice!My husband got the club. It was huge! And again, very good. They just know how to spice it up just enough to give it that extra deliciousness. We also got the goat chili cheese fries. YUM! I would suggest getting just the Goat Chili as a meal itself. A great place for a delicious meal in a casual fun atmosphere. I wish we had time to go back and just try the breakfast food!"
"We have been waiting to go to Little Goat for awhile, and with a guest in town we thought it was the perfect time. My husband and I are huge fans of The Girl and the Goat and expected similar quality from Little Goat, but left pretty disappointed.At 10 a.m. on a Saturday our wait was an hour, which is fine. When they finally texted us to get our table the hostess said, ""Hope you don't mind eating outside."" And that was that. Now, normally I'd be pleased to eat outside, but for some reason it's 60 degrees in Chicago this weekend (and it's July), and actually I didn't want to eat outside. But since we weren't given a choice, outside it was. Our table ordered Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes, Bull's Eye French Toast, and Fat Elvis Waffles.The kimchee in the first dish completely overpowered the meal. The Bull's Eye French Toast didn't have nearly enough syrup and the chicken was very dry. The Fat Elvis Waffles were overly-doused in syrup and thus got soggy immediately and the peanut butter butter was kind of disgusting - it was more like a glob of peanut butter than it was butter (and it didn't melt). We paid about what we expected, though the Bull's Eye French Toast seemed a little over-priced at $16. The best I can say about Little Goat is that it is ""Meh."" I might recommend going for the experience, but I think there are many better brunch places in the city, most of which will cost less and have a shorter wait."
"Food is average. Meh. And it was certainly not worth the wait. I've been here a few times for brunch, lunch and dinner but the food here did not blow me away. I won't make it a plan to return."
Fun place! Unique menu - fab food. Go for brunch and don't miss the backroom bar and baked goods.
"Stopped in for breakfast on our last morning in Chicago, and it did not disappoint! We were seated well within the suggested wait time, but while we waited we grabbed a coffee and pastry next door. Stumptown was delicious as always, but the house-made Sweet Cream took it up a notch. My friend and I were seated at the Diner bar, which was fine by us; it offered a nice (and appetizing) view of the kitchen. We ordered the Bulls Eye French toast (a little egg-y but overall delicious), biscuits and gravy (best biscuit I've ever had), and hash browns. Portions were generous, wait staff was friendly. All together a great visit!"
"I am not a Top Chef viewer, but I understand the owner own a few restaurants/cafes and this is one of the winners.  If I was a Top Chef fan, I would have been very disappointed.  The food was mediocre at best.  I had a sandwich with a special sauce.  The sauce did not have a lot of flavor at all.  I will say the portions are a pretty good sizeThe prices are WAY TOO MUCH for the food not to be excellent.  Everything is a la carte.  So that means for a sandwich and fries the total was 17 before taxes.  Unless the sandwich has lobster on it, this is just ridiculous.  I have been to many restaurants and paid a lot less for food that tastes so much better.The service was mediocre.  The restaurant was busy, but I often had to ask others for help because my server was no where to be found.  No one was friendly, just barely courteous.  When my friend and I go to the host and hostess, they both walked away and we had to wait for them to return to even put our names on the list.  If you are going to say you went, do an appetizer and call it a day.  Chicago has many better and cheaper options that Little Goat to get diner food!"
"Mixed on Lil G. I just love Girl and the Goat, but find Lil G good, but not amazing. Prefer Au Cheval down the street for a brunchy type meal. However, the croissants and crumpets are outstanding and worthy of 5 stars. Definitely get a side of crumpets. They're kind of like a chewy biscuit. Trust me and just get some."
"Honestly, I don't get the hype. However, it is a good place to take kids and its hard to find trendy, kid-friendly places."
"Loved it here, busy atmosphere with unusual food combos. Can't wait to go back and have things I spotted on the way out! YUM"
"My gf and I stopped down to this west loop treasure for a late brunch. We waited about 45 minutes around 2:00pm this past Saturday and found the wait to be well worth it. The service was great and we shared the reuben (which was one of, if not the best one I have ever had) the tempura mashed potatoes (awesome) and the highlight, for me at least, the bulls-eye french toast... price was much less expensive for the amount of food we ate (in addition to the yummy drinks we ordered) and is a place I will be going to often. Awesome!"
"We were seated promptly even though half of our party was still not there yet and our waiter was excellent and patient. The service is fantastic! We were lucky and got there at a lull on a Sunday morning so no wait for a table! It was a great experience, I ordered the omelet of the day which was barbecue pulled pork with an onion cream cheese which was excellent and huge. The coffee is great although I do wish they offered a dark roast as their house coffee is a light roast but that's just a detail. Our food was gotten out to us quickly even though the place was filled to the rafters by the time we ordered. Just a great experience and so worth the wait."
"I have been to Little Goat several times and have had both the breakfast and lunch items. Beware if you do not eat pork about 60% of the menu is not available to you. After going to Little Goat with a group of friends (who do not eat pork either) we ordered most of the non-pork breakfast items and shared them. We had the corned beef hash with eggs, fat elvis waffles, parathas burrito, and the spanish omlette. Everything was delicious! The only item I would not recommend is the parathas burrito, the paratha was very good and fresh, but the filling was skimpy, so the dish was mostly bread. On another ocassion I was able to try the shrimp and cheese grits and the chicken and waffles. Both were really good, with flavors that were unexpected in a very good way. I have also been to Little Goat for lunch, I had braised beef sandwich and my friend had the ruben. My braised beef sandwhich was decent, nothing to write home about and unfortuntely my freind did not like the ruben, she said it was dry, the meat looked dry to me. The employes are friendly and know the menu well, if you have any dietary restrictions they make sure you do not order something that you do not want. The atmosphere is great, you do not feel rushed even though it is always crowed!  Based on my experiences I recommend Little Goat more for breakfast/brunch instead of lunch."
Everything was superb
It's ok... the good thing is that they have gluten free menu!
"Sorry, but no. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, but with hype this big, everything on the menu should be awesome. The waiter was totally disinterested in us. His timing was way off and he didn't offer any help re: the menu. He asked how everything was the moment the food was set down, and ignored us when we wanted the check. I ordered the asian salad and my mom ordered the fish tostadas. The salad was terrible. No flavor. I had no idea that I was essentially ordering a huge bowl of slaw with (flavorless) shrimp in it. The tostadas were ok, but not great. We also go the glazed carrots as a side. Those were probably the best thing we ate and they were just a tiny side portion. Its so so loud in this place you can't hear anyone talk. I'm willing to try this place again, since everyone I know raves about it constantly, but I doubt it will be anytime soon."
"Eclectic ambiance.Great music selection.Food is trying too hard.If you are expecting the level of quality and sophistication of Girl & the Goat you will be disappointed. Yes this is a diner, but honestly it's just an overpriced way for Izard to make things they can't put on the G&G menu.We've tried it at least 3 times and have continued to be let down. It seems they are trying way too hard here with their dishes. Many of the names aren't even close to what you are getting. The only thing we've enjoyed was the Blood Orange pie.Mostly the colors and space are pretty to look at but not an ideal place to get appealing food."
"Delicious food!  Fun, lively atmosphere.  Went here for dinner with some friend and am glad I did.  I made reservations which I highly recommend since there is usually a wait.  Great place to meet up with people.  Very casual setting and overall good food."
"Came here for lunch and was told there was an hour wait.  Well, the hour wait was definitely worth it!  Our server was extremely friendly and helpful.  She recommended a few dishes which we loved!  The Pork Belly Pancake and the Crispy Shrimp Cocktails were to die for!  The shrimp cocktails were paired perfectly with a tangy horseradish and cocktail sauce - ABSOLUTELY DELISH!  We also ordered the Mac and Cheese for our little one and he loved it.  It was cooked perfectly - not too hard or too soft.  The Crab Dip was OK - I wasn't too crazy for it and honestly wouldn't order that again.  I can't wait to go back to try the rest of the stuff on the menu!"
"Great service from friendly people.  Beautiful decor.  Solid food, but I wish there were some lighter options.  Everything on the menu sounded like it would be something I would regret eating.  I had the whitefish tostadas and I sampled the goat chili, and both were tasty.  My chardonnay was a little bland for $13/glass, but overall a nice outing."
"I visited this place this past weekend with 3 youth kids and my family.  I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail however I wouldn't recommend them for children.  My young ones didn't like the noodles that they are fried in even though they normally love fried shrimp.  They were big and plump large shrimp and the cocktail sauce was tangy w/ just the right amount of spice.I also had the fish tostadas which were pretty good.  The white fish was battered and fried perfectly, however if I were to have them again, I would request them sans BBQ sauce.  I don't think the smoky and sweet sauce was compatible w/ the Asian inspired slaw on the tostada. I would definitely return and try the breakfast items."
"Three words. Fat Elvis Waffle. The peanut butter butter is exactly what it sounds like and it is pretty amazing. The waffle is hearty, but not overbearing or doughy. It's got a good fluff to it which I appreciate. Bulls Eye French Toast is not bad either, the chicken is nicely done, the french toast itself is just a bit much for me personally. I would really recommend the parathas burrito most of all though. It's a great meal with rich flavors and a nice chili pepper sauce, simple but really really well done. Good stuff here."
"This lil' Goat is rarely on my mind because I forget that it's nearby.  But I was treated to this lil' diner yesterday during the great blizzard of 2014.  It was my first time and my favorite Jew took me to congratulate me on my AVP promotion.  I've heard about lil' Goat for a while and I still have yet to dine across the street at it's big sister eatery.The place is cute AND it has valet parking which is great for mornings like yesterday.  We had no trouble finding parking on the street but it's nice to know they have valet, as I use them often.  Lil' Goat is certainly family friendly and popular.  Babies and kids are scattered throughout the happy interior and there is a nice energy in there.  We were seated as soon as we walked into the door and were pleased with a huge booth for us two.  Everyone working there had a smile on their face and the kitchen was exposed so you get that authentic diner experience.  We had the cutest ginger waiter who was very helpful with helping me choose my breakfast.  I went with the Bull's Eye French Toast. My brunch date decided to try the Shrimp & Grits but we were informed that they were all out of grits.  This presented a problem for me because I wanted a side of those cheesy grits.  He had been here many times before so he decided to order what I ordered.  We also both had bottomless mugs of coffee.The coffee arrived shortly after our lil' redhead stepped away.  We had cream and a few sips and like magic little pink goats appeared dancing along the interior walls of our mugs.  CUTE!!!  Our entrees arrived soon and I just stared at it.  There were two nice-sized slices of brioche with sliced chicken tenders and strawberries scattered across them.  They were sitting in an irregular pool of maple syrup that smelled divine but I was expecting more on my plate.  Something was missing.  I couldn't put my finger on what it was nor could I remember all the fancy words that were on the menu but  I sliced and nibbled on the corner of one of the slices and forked a piece of chicken along with a strawberry slice.  I put it in my mouth and the flavors and textures went really well together.  I was a little surprised.  We kept at our conversation and I took more bites of what my knife and fork could chop off.  The toast was a lil' soft towards the center-ish and while knifing through it a gush of yellow stuff came spilling out.  OMG!!  It was as if I was a Beverley hillbilly and I had struck black gold....or yellow....or whatever.  I was so excited because THIS is what was missing.  There was a running yolk egg in my damn French toast!!  It was Christmas all over again.  HOW did they do that??!!  Needless to say, the rest of the plate did not have a chance.  I devoured the entire plate.  There was nothing left.  My date ate half of his but he's watching his weight.  Meanwhile, I am watching mine balloon.My buddy told me there was a coffee bar next door that had fresh baked bread for sale and asked if I was interested in taking a look.  I declined because the snow was coming down and I needed a nap.  I was wedged into my booth and after releasing myself from it's grip I waddled to my car with one hand on the wheel and one hand on mah belly.  I was stuffed!!  And quite pleased.I will be back.....very soon.The End."
"I've always had a good experience here, mainly with their breakfast dishes. I'm a fan of their Asian fusions for American palettes."
Great food! Tried the crab dip and the quail 2 ways.  I had a bite of the salmon as well and it was excellent!  Very friendly service.  I went around 9 with a 10-15min wait on a saturday!
"I've done Little Goat's sophisticated older sister across the street, but sometimes you just want to wear your jeans, not wait in line, and have a messy burger.  I loved Little Goat. We waited only 5 minutes for a table on a Friday night although it was pretty packed. I opted for a patty melt and my friend had the pork belly pan cake.  Note: all the burgers have a beef, goat, or vegetarian option. I went with the goat and was not disappointed. The patty melt was lovely. My friend's pork belly pancake was pretty great too.  There really is nothing like some good pork belly. The menu had so many things that I wanted to try and since Little Goat is totally easy on the wallet, I know for sure that I will be back and will continue to eat my way through the menu. This is my kinda food!We did splurge on dessert. Went for the pork belly toffee milkshake. OK, so I know it sounds weird, but trust me. It was amazing. Salty, sweet, creamy. Can't go wrong. Service was super fast. Our waiter was completely adorable with his messy hair and beard (swoon). Places like Little Goat make me want to consider eating myself to death and dying of a heart attack at 1000 lbs in which they have to remove a wall of my house to get me out."
"This was the classiest diner ever!! Marble table tops and extra spacious booth seats were COOL. I can't classify it as a diner either and yes that is where The Little Goat excels: It provides its own value. I wasn't exactly in the mood for a large meal. I explained myself to my server Jennifer very kindly went over the menu with me for great options. We both agreed that the Pork Belly Pancake was worth the try and together with that a light pony pilsner. I felt really good when I found so many Korean-fusion dishes (pride for my own heritage perhaps?) The food was seriously seriously delicious. I was almost reminded of the chive pancakes I ate when I was a kid in Korea. It was pretty healthy (I guess?) too with the vegetables on top. Together with the pork belly and the pony pilsner, I had a wonderful meal especially with Jennifer serving me. Now the following should in no way lower the amazing experience that I suggest people can have at this place. But it happened. As I was sitting and eating, I noticed waiters/waitresses kept on approaching me and sticking their arms in front and underneath me and I heard the sound of plates. After a while, I was obliged to take a look and I saw that I was sitting on a counter beneath which they kept their dirty dishes. It didn't affect my appetite since I had already eaten the food, but the thought just kept lingering. Perhaps the restaurant should make sure their dirty dishes are somewhere else. I really don't want to give this place a bad review, but I know I have to be honest and fair and point out areas in which places can do better. After all, everyone is imperfect and no one can ever be the best."
"Have been here several times and it never disappoints.  I particularly love the goat chili with pizza puffs polished off by a cheeze-it sundae.  But really, I've had several things and sampled off the plates of my dining companions (sometimes without asking when they were distracted).  There's not a bad choice to be had.Long wait times unless you beat or wait out the lunch rush.  Coffee is amazing.  One of my favorite downtown spots hands-down.  Only wish they had more pie options."
"We put our names in and waited the hour to get seated, and brunch was worth the wait. We luckily didn't get seated at the communal table. Our party of 4 was in a comfortable booth. I ordered the spicy ginger ale and it hit the spot. I love the unique flavors and creative dishes. I got the Breakfast Spaghetti 'N Clams 'N Crabs and it was surprised me in a great way. I tasted the other 3 dishes that my girlfriends got and really liked them as well - the Bull's Eye French Toast, the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing, and the Shrimp & Grits. The little goat coffe was pretty good even without the sugar, and that's saying something to me who usually always has coffee with some type of sugar in it. Somehow the goat milk gave the coffee flavor which took on a more complex taste than regular cow's milk. I would love to come back here and try other items on the menu. Our waitress was friendly and helpful with recommendations. The prices are a bit higher, but the unique and creative dishes are worth it!"
"Best. Bloody Mary. Ever. Words escape me. I didn't think a tomato juice drink could possibly be this delicious, and yet here I stand corrected. No crappy zing-zang mix here, this bloody Mary is out of this world. I think if we could all start the day off with vodka, pickled onion juice, kimchi, masala, and miso adorned with a goat cheese stuffed olive and pickled pepper... the world would be a much better place. While I could probably live off of these bloody mary's alone, I thought it would probably be best to chase the vodka with some food, you know, since that's what we originally came for. This menu is certainly not for the faint of heart, or for that matter - those prone to heart attacks. The menu is ambitious, and delicious, but not necessarily nutritious. Fat Elvis waffles, breakfast spaghetti and bull's eye french toast (with crispy chicken) are just a few of the heavy hitters you'll find on the menu - so bring your appetite when you come to eat here. Sure, there are a few lighter and possibly healthier menu options... but let's be honest, that's not why you came here (it was for the bloody Mary). I tried the kimchee / bacon / eggs / pancakes Asian style breakfast tasty thing - and no I didn't forget the name of the dish, that's what it's called, and it's fantastic. It's a play on okonomiyaki - a savory Japanese pancake / street food. The combination of the crisp bacon, the soft eggs, the slight doughiness of the pancake and the tangy kimchee and ponzu style sauce was superb. Other than that, we got to try the breakfast spaghetti with clams 'n crab. This dish wasn't quite as enjoyable as the ""Japanese pancakes"", it was just a little too rich for so early in the morning. But throw a runny egg over clam/crab pasta with parmesan, pork, and bok choy any other time of the day - and I'm in. Aside from the fact that we were slightly caught off guard by the richness - this dish was great as well. Speaking of rich, the last dish we got to try was the brandade and belly. As the theme goes with the rest of the menu - there was no shortage of flavor in this dish either. Everything we tried was great, just don't expect to go run a marathon after eating here.Oh and they serve breakfast all day, 7 days a week, late night on weekends? You had me at bloody Mary. Overall Grade: A"
"I honestly just wasn't impressed.  Very ""bougie"" and ""LA"".  Extremely overpriced.  They did not give much food because everything is ""a la carte"". Just a waste of money, in my opinion.  The food wasn't memorable but it wasn't bad by any means.  If you have a lot of money then you have nothing to worry about."
"If you're looking for eccentric diner food, then Little Goat is the place to be! I ordered the Tuna Melt and expected a normal melt, but I received a Tuna Melt that looked very unique and different. The sourdough bread was placed on the bottom, while the albacore tuna, nicoise salad and the cheese sauce were placed on top. The presentation was amazing and the taste lived up to the expectations according to the appearance. Little Goat was a great go to for lunch, but they tend to get very busy during lunch so get there early!"
"This is undeniably one of my favorite restaurants in the city, especially when I'm looking for comfort food. The goat almighty burger is amazing and the corned beef kimchee rueben is one of my favs. The chili cheese fries are a meal in themselves and the pork belly pancakes (not actual pancakes) are awesome. I've been for brunch and dinner and have never been disappointed."
"Summer Fridays, I love you. Why? Because you allow me to waltz into LG, take a seat with no wait, and indulge in the most perfect breakfast. Or Brunch. Or lunch. All of it is good.We sat in a booth, but the counter looked fun too. Ordered some coffee and loved the adorable little goat on the inside of the cup. It just puts you in a good mood. The husband's breakfast looked delicious. Okay, okay, it WAS delicious. I know this because I kept sneaking little bites of his pancakes. I mean, cream cheese butter? C'mon. I thought he was going to swat my hand away. I ordered the fish tostados and they were perfect. Very fresh with just the right amount of crunch.And then we split a thing of smoked fries. The girl that was serving us said we had to try them. And she was right. Just the right hint of flavor. Loved the decor and the bakery next door. Pick up a cup of coffee to go or a small gift for a friend.And after all this, off we went, full and happy and ready to take on whatever our summer Friday brought our way. We will be back again. I think I hear the rooftop and a cocktail calling my name right now..."
Fat Elvis...fat club....smoked pork milkshake. ..lolI love it. It's a restaurant that went for the old time diner feel.The asian fusion and traditional breakfast and lunch items...simply just work here. Very good food.
"It is usually crowded and hard to get a table or counter space, but I went at 4:00 in the afternoon, for a very late lunch. I sat at the counter.I had the Asian Shrimp Saladcabbage . bok choy . radish . red oak . crisp wonton . ginger mapleIt tasted good, but also kind of strange, in that there were maybe 8 small shrimp in a very larg bowl on top of a giant mound of the cole slaw type concoction. It was kind of like I had a giant bowl of cole slaw. I was blown away by Girl and Goat, but the sister restaurant, that is mainly diner food with a flair, in my opinion, was not as good, but I only had this one meal, so it would maybe not be fair to judge on just the Asian Shrimp Salad."
"great location, reasonably priced, awesome take on diner fare.  This is a place you don't want to miss, whether in Chicago for an afternoon or a week.  They have their own onsite bakery which is in the back of the side bar.  You can view the activity in the bakery through the glass windows in the bar.  Also in the sidebar, is a full-service coffee bar, bread store and specialty food shop."
"Overall, unimpressed.I went to brunch there once.  The first thing I noticed was that they were charging 8$ for a Dark Horse.  At that point I knew I'd never come here again.But let's talk about the actual meal I had.  I ordered the hot chocolate, which took a really long time and was cold by the time I got it.  I'm sure it would have been really good if it was actually hot.  The server seemed frazzled but friendly, so I didn't want to bother him with taking it back (especially since it took 10 minutes to get there in the first place).Like many Chicago restaurants, there is a massive dearth of vegetarian dishes.  For breakfasty foods, that seems ridiculous.  I got a kimchee breakfasty dish thing, which was really pretty boring, considering the ingredients.  It also took a really long time.  My partner got the tofu griddle, which was omg bland.  Overall: Service was slow, food was overpriced, food was totally bland and boring.  I'd also classify it as one of (many) Chicago restaurants that seem to think the customer should be grateful to sit in the hallowed dining room.  Not interested in braving the crowds at Little Goat ever again."
"If you get eggs, bacon etc, you're missing out. Super creative food. Have had tuna melt (divine), Korean veggie burger (Kim Jong Un would squeal), tempura mashed potatoes (pure genius) and Mac and cheese (above avg, but not the scene stealer I've read about). Service was A+ but not aggressive. Oh, the Hoopoe's Hope cocktail will make anyone a gin fan. Over the top."
"Major fan of this place. Major.Yes, it can be a bit of a wait, but there's an awesome bar attached. And when it comes to getting a table, there's a counter, outdoor seating, rooftop, booths, communal, you name it.Dinner, brunch, late night breakfast, lunch, they've got a little of everything. And everything I've had here is awesome. (Veggie chap chae is my favorite entree)The servers are always helpful. There was one time that our order took awhile to come out from the kitchen, and the server knew we had movie plans so she boxed up a comped dessert for us to take with (some sort of blood orange tart, it was delicious)."
Their coffee shop/bakery attached to the diner serves some of the best coffee we've found in Chicago.  Bakery also has some great bread choices
Fantastic service. Tasty drinks. Food was fabulous. Only complaint was that I had to Google every other ingredient in the drink menu to figure out whati was ordering. I realize I'm not very hip but this was a little too pretentious. Everything we tried on the menu was fantastic.
"The jelly, oh the jelly; maybe it was just the lighting or maybe it was because I hadn't slept in 36 hours, but the jelly had the most amazing lustre and consistency I have ever seen.  It was like a paste of amethysts spread across a butter-crusted landscape.The toast and jelly didn't last long; but lo and behold, beneath granola and nestled in yogurt, is more jelly.  A quick mining operation initiated with a spoon extracted the jelly for quick consumption."
"Grabbed brunch here a few weeks ago and it was solid.  I have eaten at The Girl and the Goat, which is good (not get a reservation six months in advance good), but good.  This is Izard's take on a classic diner and I think she succeeds with the concept.Right when you walk in you are struck with the common diner fixtures: bright space, breakfast counter, lots of people, noisy crowed space, and waitresses carrying around carafes of coffee.  There was a wait when I got there on Friday at 10:30 for brunch but I brought a book, grabbed some sidewalk, and was called for a table in about 25 minutes.  They text you when the table is ready, a nice touch.When we sat down the server was a bit slow to get over and greet us.  She was apologetic all morning for her generally tardiness but I was on vacation and not in a hurry.  I was with a friend and she ordered the Shrimp and Cheesy Grits and I had the Parathas Burrito.  She definitely ordered the more successful dish. This was a take on the traditional shrimp and grits.  The shrimp came in a spicy tomato based broth with corn and pistachios.  The shrimp was perfectly cooked as were the grits.  The only complaint was that there could have been more grits on the plate to hold up to the soupy shrimp topping.I had the Parathas burrito which was an Indian flatbread topped with an frisee salad, an avocado and bean salsa and a sunny side up egg.  The dish was good but there needed to be something more to really elevate it.  The salsa was barely there and I had to ask for extra chili pepper sauce to flavor the amount of bread that was there.The coffee was great which is a must in any respectable diner and I would go back again to try other dishes.  I would rather wait 25 minutes for these offerings than six months for the dishes at the Girl and the Goat."
"The restaurant decor is very cool, but the service is not great.  It was very busy but we were put at the community table and it was impossible to hear my friends talking because the music was so loud. It took 30 minutes to get our food and we ordered as soon as sat down.  I had the gluten free pancakes and they were good.  My friends had the fried pickle and a burger and neither were outstanding."
the blueberry pie with goat cheese gelato!!!!!that is all.
"The description of breakfast @littlegoat ""It taste like the sunrising and setting at the same time with each bite"". The mangers James and Jim are down to earth guys that took the time to stop by and have a conversation. I've actually been to Little Goat about a dozen times, so its fair to say I've tried everything on the menu. My favorites have to be the Sloppy Goat, Mac & Cheese (mixed with their Goat Chili) and the Chickpea Salad. Great Breakfast spot as well. My only rub is that they don't allow you to order take out."
"Expect to wait at this place as it is always crowded.As we waited for our table we went upstairs to their rooftop bar, which I would highly recommend. We went up there in August and the weather was beautiful and we had drinks while enjoying the view. For lunch I had the tonkatsu, the pork was cooked absolutely perfectly. To top off a great meal the cookie pie was delicious!"
"The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because their food is hit or miss. Don't get me wrong, I do appreciate the different flavors, but sometimes bok choy does not go with everything.Staff and ambiance is perfect. Lots of really delicious entrees like Los Drowned and French Toast and Chicken!"
"You must try the Los Drowned and Sloppy Goat.  WOW!  All the food here is interesting, delicious, and fun.  Its a good thing I don't live to close to this place or I would be broke."
"Coffee & pastries: 5 stars Brunch: 4 stars So between the two, 4.5 stars?  Love the coffee bar!  Great add to the West Loop with  Intelligentsia Coffee and expresso drinks and delicious scones that taste super fresh. On the fence on the bagels - the schmear is inventive and exceptional but the bagel is a little smaller and flatter than I was looking for. Brunch was the opposite - big portions and heavy!  Good for a hangover brunch maybe?  Rich flavors but a bit carb heavy and by the time our nice waiter asked if we wanted dessert, we had all but fallen asleep from the food coma."
"Best way to start off a day, right here. Sorry Wheaties. You are pretty much guaranteed wait-time for this place, especially in the morning. It is bustling, every table has people, and waiters/waitresses are zooming in and out of the kitchen/dining area. I went with the brandade and belly, and my friend got the tasty Asian breakfest thingy, that entree's name is way too long. Anyways, it took us over 60 minutes to sit down, 20 minutes to order, and about 10 to eat. Nuff said.The brandade and belly is made with some brandade, pork belly, sunny side up eggs, biscuits and kimchi. Brandade is according to Wikipedia, an emulsion of salkt cod and olive oil, eaten in winter with bread or potatoes. Bad timing I guess, since I ate this in the middle of August. Oh well. The pork belly was really juicy, but there were parts where it got a little dry, but that is my only complaint besides the wait. Everything else was spectacular, five star treatment baby!"
"Hey, my primary restaurant is obnoxiously crowded and good but not quite worth the two month wait. Why don't I open a casual diner across the street to catch some of the spillover?BRILLIANT IDEA.Little Goat manages to keep the avant garde, in your face bold and crazy approach to menu items that the original restaurant has while making the food a bit more approachable. I was tempted by the whitefish & harissa tostadas and the special beef heart gyro, but I ended up with the pork belly pancake which was quite literally one of the best lunch items I have ever consumed. Meaty, fatty pork belly beneath a crunchy asian slaw dressed with ginger and maple (but more ginger than maple). All over an absurdly crisp/tender flaky asian style pancake with a hoisin kick. I would make love to this dish over and over again.Our table had some other stuff but I will choose not to highlight anything else until I can return to eat my face out of it rather than pick from the snippets I tasted off others' plates."
"As a designer, it adds so much to the experience of a restaurant for everything to be so fantastically designed like at the little goat. It's the prettiest 'diner' on earth. Also, the food is incredible, and the prices are reasonable especially for Chicago. Do it."
"This was the third time I've been here for lunch.  I ordered the Crab Rangoon Omelette since I've already tried the Reuben (fantastic) and the Burger (Also fantastic), which are my ""go to"" sandwiches.  This place has a knack for putting unlikely items together that seem odd on paper but make total sense when you taste it.  This omelette was so good it inspired me to write a review.  There was just enough crab filler that it wasn't overwhelming.  The egg was thin enough to balance out the different flavors, which included a sweet and sour sauce with small chunks of pineapple.  Adding the crispy strips on top made it complete and exactly what you would expect from something called ""Crab Rangoon Omelette"".Unfortunately it was the special of the day but they should definitely consider making it a part of the regular menu."
"Really, really, really don't get what the fuss is about here. Food was spectacularly greasy and heavy. Had a hard time finding anything we wanted to eat. Glorifying fat is lazy in my opinion. Work harder to coax great flavors and textures with less fat, please! Surely that's what a Top Chef should be able to do, yes?"
"Ate here for the first time today after admiring the menu for months. Got there around one-ish had a 20 min wait. They have a texting service that can text message you when your table is ready. I liked this option ,that ways don't have to carry one of those awkward flashy,vibrating "" hey your table is ready"" things. Pros: portions are good size,so come hungry.          Pretty expansive menu and breakfast can be served all day         Bakery next door, with fresh bread baked daily          Decor is subtle and modernCons: it is insanely loud. Like I have to scream at you to hear me. Even in hole the wall diners I can hear the person I am sitting across fromSandwiches do not come with a side. They are extra. I was uber annoyed by this. Sandwich with out fries is like pbj with no j!Server was nice but she was busy which made service slower than it should've been for a Tuesday afternoon.Cappuccino is terrible.....super bitter....bleh!I will return to try breakfast at some point. The Reuben was delicious! Good job Stephanie Izard!"
"Why five stars? Well, when the food is incredible and the service and price are on point then how can I not. Here is a list of what I shared here the other night, all of which was terrific and executed to perfection.-SMOKED CORNED BEEF HASH WITH EGGSeggs served sunny side up from griddle-SLAGEL BEEF BURGER--KOREAN STYLEkimchee . bacon . egg . spicy mayo . squish squash roll-GOAT CHILI CHEESE FRIESEverything about the experience here was done right, all the way down to the ice cold Coke which was served in a glass with pellet ice, just the way a Coke should be consumed. Damn, they thought of everything here...Enjoy Suckas'!!!"
"It pains me to give this place 3 stars, although it is completely due to the service that we received last Thursday night. I have been here 3 times and (embarrasingly enough have ordered the same thing every time;). I was pretty happy with food and service last 2 visits, although this past one did not meet expectations. SERVICE: First off, the waitress rushed me through my oder, and once everyone was done ordering, I asked her if I could add one more thing and she told me, ""only if you do it quickly."" I couldn't figure out why she would say that...was such a bizarre thing to say to a customer. I also had to flag her down several times (via other staff) to refill drinks, water, get bill, etc. as she would just dissappear throughout our time there.FOOD: The Beef All American Burger is sensational! It is typically made perfectly with an extremely yummy sauce, although this last visit, I ordered it well done and it came back medium (pink and red). While I understand that mistakes happen and so I sent it back (they apologiezed for inconvenience and took the burger off the bill), unfortunately, we were with a party of 5 and everyone finished their entrees by the time I received my meal. However, everyone in our party really enjoyed their food and commented on how delicious every single thing was. AMBIANCE: Love decor and diner feel. Extremely loud, so definitely not a place to go for intimate conversation.Overall, great place with excellent food. Will probably give it one more chance in the future in the hopes that they get a better handle on their service quality."
"This restaurant is great. It has the feel of a 50's diner and the menu is very outside the box. Great concept! My 6 year old nephew was a bit skeptical because the food wasn't very traditional but he warmed up once the food was placed on the table. I had to use yelp photos as some sort of a reference when ordering because I really didn't know what I was getting myself into, which def helped. We got 4 total dishes between my sister, nephew, and I  including  the Fat Elvis Waffles and the Bulls Eye French Toast which were stunning dishes. The ambiance and food earned 4 stars easily. The service and staff bumped it up to 5. I forget our servers name but she was wonderful, very pleasant & attentive. My nephew left his hat in our booth and one of the staff members chased us outside to give it to us. Little things like that make a big difference. I will make it a point to have breakfast here every time I'm in Chicago"
"I've been meaning to write about my ever increasing love of the little goat diner for a while, so here goes:1. I am absolutely in love with the Chickpea salad. Chicago is a meat lovin' town, and many little goat items focus on those of the carnivorous persuasion, however, the Chickpea salad is an explosion of vegetables packed with a sassy dressing punch. I swoon over this salad.2. Service, coffee, baked goods (artisan bread! cookies!) and bartenders are all excellent.  These are the foundational elements that create a good diner. (Well, I added bartenders in.)3. For all the upscale restaurants selling $30 small plates on Randolph, this does something important: It makes the skill and power of good food accessible to those outside the upscale range.  Now that's something I can support, and will continue to, so long as they keep the Chickpea salad on the menu!"
"What is the big deal about this place? Its crowded and loud, the servers don't check on you when you expect them to. And... the WORST tuna melt I have ever had in my life. Its so unfortunate with all the hype this place gets. Maybe I was there on an off night?"
"I had off on a Summer Friday and thought this would be the perfect place to go to skip a wait. We get there right around lunch time and as we requested an outdoor table only had to wait a few minutes. This gave us time to go to the bar and order a drink and right when we got the drink our table was ready. When we got to try our Bloody Mary, it was surprisingly strong and flavorful, so you certainly get the bang for your buck! A side note- the rooftop is only for when you order food in the bakery to go and bring it up to the roof yourself. I did not know this so we sat on their side patio, as it felt odd to order a hot brunch to go. Let me start the food off by saying we got there around 11:30 on a weekday and immediately wanted to order the Ooey Gooey Cinnabon, and you just need to believe the menu as you gotta get there early.... they were sold out and we were super sad. But lucky to say, that didn't ruin our experience! I got the Parathas Burrito and don't be fooled by the ""burrito"" in the title. It is nothing like a burrito but that doesn't matter, because it was amazing. The portion was huge and I couldn't help but eat every last bite-- I literally licked the plate clean. The indian flatbread it comes with was so soft but yet had a great crunch and the sauce and eggs mixed with it was a perfect pairing. My friend got the Branade and Belly, which they say is their version of an Eggs Benedict. She seemed very pleased with it and it truly was a unique and delicious spin! On another visit, my boyfriend got the Bull's Eye French Toast which was great, too. Just the right amount of salty and sweet!Their fries and mac and cheese looked amazing too. The wait staff is very friendly and accommodating -- my second time at LIttle Goat, there was a backup in the kitchen and the waiter certainly compensated for our wait (even though we didn't mind)!Great place to go and certainly worth the wait!"
Get the goat chili cheese fries as an app! Loco Moco was very tasty as well.
"The wait: 1 hour. But did you know...you can order from the bar? Surprisingly, not many people know that. Little Goat is delicious, definitely worth a stop and the wait, grab coffee at a different place until you can get seated. This is one of those restaurant I would keep coming back to for the same dish/to try other dishes! Coffee - decentSmoke Corned Beef Hash and Eggs: the beef was so good! omg..I want some of this right now. I made a mistake and took my eggs scrambled, rooky move. Should have gone for the sunny side up! Brandade and Belly: holy sh*t is this amazing. I can't even explain to you the awesomness that is within this dish. The kimchi, egg, bisquit AND pork belly go so perfectly well together. I would come back multiple times just to get this dish. Sloppy Goat - wasn't terrible, but not a fan. Maybe because I'm used to beef not goat for sloppy joes. Still worth trying!Oh - don't even forget the drinks. Mimosas/bloody marys? Ah done. The waiter/bar tender was great too, super chill guy. Great time, go!"
"Went twice this week and got the paratha burrito. It combined flavors that I would not expect to work, but it was delicious! The apple fennel pie was also the best pie I've had. Service was great and overall this place is worth the wait!"
"Since it seems like you can never get a reservation at the Girl and the Goat in this city, we decided to check out The Little Goat Diner, a spinoff of the popular Girl and the Goat. From what I""ve heard, this place is always just as packed. Luckily, me and a couple friends had a Tuesday afternoon off so when we got there, we were seated right away. The menu is little overwelming, as in, you want to eat every single thing on it. They also have a pretty good beer selection if you into the being a beer snob thing. I settled on the Bullseye French Toast, which is french toast with fried chicken tenders and strawberries (Rich man's chicken and waffles???). Followed that with a side of tempura mashed potatoes (fried mashed potatoes). Do I need to keep going with this review after my last 2 sentences? No, so I'm done."
"Been wanting to try this place after all the hype. And now I know that all the hype is worth it !! 1. surprisingly didnt have to wait for longer than 35 minutes.And its nice that they text you when they are ready for you which gives you time to walk around and not hover by their entrance !!  2.For a vegetarian they do have a few good options. The parathas burrito, chickpea salad and veggie jhap chae was worth the try. Lovely blend of flavors. 3.The best dishes is the fried pickle sandwich and the tiramisu shake !! The perfectly fried pickle (not too oily) mixed in with roasted peppers, hummus and tatziki in this perfect combination is totally delicious.                The tiramisu shake is creamy, tasty and as sinful as it can get. Was difficult not to order another one !! The only flip side to this place is the poorly working AC. But the food I think s totally worth it.going back to try out the breakfast dishes ( they serve them all day ..yaaay)"
"Tara the manager, and Joan our server, were awesome.  But...the corned beef hash and eggs had a ton of onions on it, not cooked in it, but chopped and tossed in.  Wasn't listed on the menu.  Other than that, food and service was excellent."
"I have gone here several times to try and find one dish I really like. I LOVE Girl & the Goat, so I thought this should be comparable. Keep in mind I am a vegetarian, so I know that I have limited options. However, every single dish I have eaten here (I have been 5 times for lunch)- my meal has been sub-par. The salads are boring, the egg dishes are bland, and I had the worst veggie Chop-chae I have ever had yesterday. The dishes lack in taste and flavor. Everything is heavy. I usually take a few bites and not much more, and not once has a server asked me if I liked my dish. This place is over-rated. The real Girl & the Goat is amazing, this place is just a fancy looking diner that throws kimchee on meals to try and make it appear better then it is. As a side-note- the cafe/bakery next door that serves sandwiches at the bar... totally awesome. The Kale salad is simple and delicious and the rest of the lunch spread is great. Perhaps they should allow some of those items to the diner component of the space to add variety, taste and better options."
"I just do not understand the rave reviews of this place and mind you this is coming from someone who's eaten here on five separate occasions - not necessarily because I specifically chose to.Simply put: the food is overwrought and over thought and overpriced.Obviously I know this is not a true down-home diner but the fact that every single side you may want to go along with your food (eggs, toast, etc.) is priced separately at about three bucks a pop is absurd. It's not that the food is bad but it's not that great either and it's certainly not worth the crazy wait or the price. Too bad because I was really expecting to love Little Goat."
"The Girl and the Goat's sister establishment is a diner with a rather interesting menu, great service and reasonable prices. The menu is overwhelming, to say the least. It begs the question if they can make all of those things greatly. Having experienced The Girl and the Goat, i have faith. Since I was overwhelmed with the selection, I asked my server to bring me what he thought I should have. I tried this at the sister restaurant to phenomenal results. And I was smart to do so. The server brought me something I would not have ordered: Pork shoulder, in a broth. It was amazing. I complimented that with a glass of wine from the limited by the glass wine menu. My companion ordered the goat burger, which was well seasoned and perfectly cooked. Our sampling experience was limited to those items, plus the smoked house fries, that sounded more special than they actually were. Overall solid experience. Since we went at 2PM on a Friday, there was no wait for a table. I can see this place filling up quickly and often. By the time we left around 4PM, all tables were taken and they was a line out... Plan accordingly. 2 main courses, plus a side, plus 4 glasses of wine topped out at $95. Not bad."
"Awesome food and a modern diner ambience. My friend from Portland (a Food Enthusiast) came to visit and suggested this place. The food selection are sooo good and with the option to try things with goat meat thus the name. Took a little time for us to get in since it's a St. Patty's day weekend so better call ahead. I got the loco moco with goat patty instead of regular burger paty which is an interesting twist to the hawaiian dish. Even the dark chocolate chip pancakes are amazing and the kids loved it. The food presentation and ideas are fun just like the Crispy shrimp cocktail wrapped on noodles and deep fried, then put it in a lettuce cup. Can't wait to try the restaurant ""Girl & the Goat"" just right across the street for a more formal dining experience. Service is also fantastic! I highly recommend going here."
"Best way to put this is I felt the food was no better than a Denny's, just more expensive. Came for dinner and had:REUBENMAC N' CHEESEFRIED CHICKENCHOCO TACOBLOOD ORANGE MERINGUE PIEVANILLA MILKSHAKEThere was nothing special or memorable about any of these dishes. You could find equal or better at your average dinner/greasy spoon. I wouldn't write this place off since I didn't have breakfast but I doubt I will be making a return trip for dinner anytime soon."
"Honestly I wanted to love Little Goat, I wanted it so hard.  I wanted it as hard as I want those Juicy Pear Jelly Bellies when I open a bag of jelly beans.  But sometimes you get those icky chalky jelly beans that are pretending to be gourmet and come at premium prices when you were expecting the Jelly Belly.As someone else said, make sure you double check that they have your number down right to text you.  Luckily I walked in and made sure, and she said she had just tried to text me.  Strangely she had completely forgotten my face and name within 6 minutes.  The place was lunch-crowded, but I think that's part of your job as a hostess.Communal seating for about half of the diner.The menu is a la carte/small-plates style, but in a diner atmosphere, which is confusing.  Basically instead of ordering a burger w/fries, you pay $14 for your burger + $4 for your fries.  You could also choose a different side dish.  Part of the reason I go to nicer places is that I trust the chefs and their experienced palates to pair foods in an interesting and inventive way for me.  Having the responsibility myself always worries me that I'll put two clashing dishes together.  That said, the risk seems mitigated at Little Goat because the menu is fairly cohesive: American comfort foods with a gentle Korean twist.We started with $6 bowl of tomato apple soup, which tastes like a slightly sweet tomato soup.  Meh.  Next we had the pork belly pancake, which is awesome, except for the pork belly part.  The fluffy scallion pancake is full of flavor and holds up well to the very dressed sweet-tangy slaw on top of it.  The pork belly was a big slab of salty soft meat, but the flavors in it were lacking.  Just salty and soft.We also had the salmon-pork belly salad, which had kale and winter greens and maybe celery or fennel in it, as well as red onion.  I listed all the things because the salad tasted completely homogenous: the dressing overwhelmed all the flavors, including the salty pork belly bits (which acted like croutons) and the bland salmon and even the bite of red onions.  Tamarind dressing, and I love tamarind (Vietnamese hot and sour soup, anyone?) but ugh.It took us a very, very long time to find our server, Matt, and get our check, and it also took a long time for him to go run our credit cards.  We and the couple next to us spent a while just looking at him as he chatted with a table of 8 while holding our credit cards.  There are a LOT of people who work at Little Goat: the bakery next door bakes all the bread for the diner, for sale, and for Girl and the Goat, and there's a bartender and several baristas, and hostesses, and busboys, and chefs.  It's only been open for a little over 4 months, but they need to work on their communication.  We got our food after both parties next to us, who were seated after us (this is OK, the place is busy) but no one seemed to know who had ordered what.  Some dishes came out twice- i.e. the couple next to us had a sandwich delivered, then a few minutes later, a copy of that sandwich appeared which no one had ordered.  Meanwhile the other half of the couple was sitting and waiting for his meal for a long time.  Our soup went to them first, and we got someone's burger (which looked quite good).We'll be back (mostly because he wants to go back) to try other dishes, and hopefully bump up a few stars.  There's gotta be a good jelly bean in there somewhere."
"A serious staple and favorite of mine in the city. Both adventurous AND picky eaters alike will be happy here. I have yet to order something I don' t like (the shakes are good, the reuben is good, the fries are good, the drinks are good....), and the staff always seems friendly even when it's PACKED. In fact, one time when we evidently were waiting too long for our food (which, honestly, we didn't even notice), we got comped a few apps. How lovely. I will say, watch your timing. It sounds like the prime brunch times get completely insane. I've always come for dinner and/or VERY early morning to beat the completely crazy crowds."
"Service was the big problem here, at least at 6 PM at the counter on a Sunday night.  Our waitress poured us glasses of water, then disappeared for 15 minutes while we twiddled our thumbs waiting to order.  Finally flagged down another server to find ours, then waited some more.  When our server eventually re-appeared, a, ""Sorry for the wait, folks, what can I get you?"" would have gone a long way, but instead, she just casually asked, ""Are you ready to order?"" with no indication that she was aware that that yes, we were pretty much ready to order 15 minutes earlier.The decadent mac and cheese was the big hit of the evening--I could have devoured even more of it than the enormous side portion we received.  The sandwiches we ordered (the braised beef and the pork cutlet, respectively) were fine, if not inspired, and very large.I have to say, for the price and the wait time for a table (no reservations accepted), I'm not inclined to give Little Goat another chance, based on the just OK meal and the cruddy service."
"Overall an excellent experience.  I will start with recommendations for improvement...both the cinnamon roll and the smoked fries would taste better if served warmer.  The cinnamon roll is very delicious and very rich...gooey with the indulgent frosting, however was just a bit warm when served.  A just out of the oven or close to it temperature would be much better.  Also, the fries were not that appetizing as it seems as though they were sitting around before being brought out.  They were not hot and barely warm...chewy too rather than crispy.   Finally, I stopped over in the Little Bread area and was thinking of getting something to go, however the person at the counter who was taking orders and money used their bare hands to serve customers food...not sanitary at all.The Veggie Chap Chae was so very delicious...excellent combination of flavors, sweet potato noodles, veggies, and cashews.The service was very good.Wrapped up with the The Little Goat from the coffee bar.  Yummy!Would love to come back sometime."
"Amazing food, the chef absolutely blew my mind, the staff treated me like family, & I will definitely search out anything this chefs name is on...she knows how to do food right...get the breakfast spaghetti!!!"
"I've been here a few times; sat in the dining area and also eaten at the bar.  It's a cute diner with a lot of unique/bizarre options on the menu.  I think you have to be a little daring and order something any way.  The food, ambiance, cleanliness, and service have been pretty good each time."
"i REALLY wanted to like this place but i can't officially endorse it. long story short i think this is a breakfast/lunch/brunch place more than anything. dinner was blehi got the pork belly pancake thing but there was hardly any meat. the execution overall was just subpar. when i say hardly any meat i had 2 2""x2"" strips of pork underneath the mountain of cole slaw. the crab dip was good but presentation could be better even if its a dinerone of my friends got a breakfast dish and that seemed stellarplace is VERY NOISY just FYIwe were seated in the corner booth and service was spotty. that means a lot since i ONLY care aobut my soda refills when it comes to service. the server seemed to want to go home or just wasn't there in my opinion we got the blueberry pie which was not warm (may not even be described as warm) which would've been awesome but the thing that threw me off was that the crust was not flake but slightly rubbery texture if aything. the structure looked like it was pre-baked and then stored for use later. it was not crumbling but folding. the goat cheese gelato - ifyou do not like goat cheese you will HATE ITthe choco taco was weak to me. you throw 4 tiny strips of tortilla chips and supposedly that crowns it a choco taco. i loved the diversity of the menu but foodservice is not just about food. im very passionate about this. the food plays the biggest part but i expected more from this place. i still plan to go to girl and the goat.i kind of wonder if they are still trying to figure out what the identity of little goat is vs its bigger sibling??JEANS: OK by farORDER: waitress/waiterasian looking host was PHENOMENAL"
"I've already conquered Girl & The Goat, and was ready on this visit to conquer Little Goat. Little Goat may be a cheaper alternative to the finer dining atmosphere of Girl, but the quality of food remains the same.The only downside is that it's more difficult to sample multiple items here. And there is A LOT to choose from. I finally decided on the Korean burger. Goat meat patty, sunny egg, kimchi, bacon, chipotle mayo, on a squish squash roll. Could very well be the best dang burger I've ever had. Man that was tasty.I was also very intrigued by the smoked pork & toffee milkshake, so I had to try it. Toffee lovers must try this. I felt like a candy store exploded in the bottom of my milk shake. There was a hint of smokiness from the pork, but if you didn't tell me that pork was in the milkshake I wouldn't have known. Yummy!"
Only weird thing about this place was the diner atmosphere.  Food is way too good for a diner.  Excellent choices all around.  Can't go wrong.
I checked this place out while visiting Chicago and I would go back in a heart beat!
"Believe it or not, I drive past this place 5 days a week. Today, I celebrated my best friends birthday here. The staff is so genuinely friendly, I felt like family. Ben, the Front House Manager, and his crew worked in such unison, we were amazed. The food, oh my Gosh!!! We enjoyed the crisp, freshness of the pickles and onions. The Goat burger (wing style) on a potato bun was beyond heavenly. It melted on my palate. My Mom-in-love have the crisp shrimp cocktail and was delighted by the generously sized, succulently juicy shrimp! The cocktail sauce is good & spicy though! The smoky fries are one of a kind! You must try them!! They even helped with the surprise cake we brought with us! She was also happy with not only the coffee, but with the mug in which it was served. The Daddy goat, the mommy goat, and the baby goat appear inside the mug as you empty the richly delicious coffee. When I thanked our server, he admitted that Little Goat treats them well. That was all I needed to hear to make this diner my number one place to eat! Great job Goats!"
"I was super excited to try this because I like comfort food with a little creativity. The menu is a little overwhelming, but i settled on the fat elvis waffles and wasn't wowed. All of the components were good, but all together it was a little much. the peanut butter butter was way too rich to enjoy, and combined with the waffles just didn't do it for me. I'm definitely not someone who doesn't love sugar, either. I have quite the sweet tooth. I just kind of felt it was over-hyped. Maybe I should've gotten a burger or something?  I probably wont go back. Also, my soda was flat."
"For a while I seriously doubted the hype because I had only eaten here in passing on a day I wasn't ready to drop a lot of money on food - so I ended up having just a little cup of the tomato apple soup and then, to be funny, split a glass of chocolate goat milk with my friend - we thought it was funny and in retrospect, really it wasn't that funny, except that I usually don't drink milk and only wanted it ""because it came from a goat."" My stomach certainly didn't find it funny.But this time I came with a good friend and we ordered real food -- I got the Korean goat burger and he a goat patty melt. Oh boy, was it good. I understand the hype. The fries were great too. It sure is a hell of a lot of food and I'd probably split one next time, but really pretty innovative and fun things going on here, and cute atmosphere."
"I was very excited to try this place after visiting the Girl and the Goat many times an absolutely loving it. I was severely let down though. The food is nothing better than what you'd get in a standard diner but with a premium price. Portions were very large and it was too heavy, greasy and fatty. I sampled both the Patty Melt with goat meat and the Fish Tostados, and both under-performed for me.  I did not feel well after dining here. All the components are there for a great brunch spot, I just feel its not executed well. I did very much enjoy the Tomato and Apple soup however and that was a highlight of my meal."
"For the the expectations and word of mouth,  I found this breakfast / brunch place to be d isappointing.   Actually, I woke up super early to avoid the lines as my first attempt was going on Friday around 2pm for lunch but wait line were about 35 minutes long which I ended up at great burger place which exceed my expectations.   Don't go there unless you don't have any other option.  The wait staff was friendly and ignored us the rest of time not knowledgeable of the food.   He was too busy providing better service at the bigger table.  Overall review:Wait staff: Friendly at first then ignored us the whole time.Food: bland, not flavorful at all.Waiting time: try going for late lunch friday 45 minutes wait, best to go early Sat around 9amI don't recommend it.   Check out other venues in West loop.  There is a burger place a few blocks down."
"Nice place, good location, I had the LOS DROWNED sandwich, it was really good.  Make reservations!"
"I can't say I loved the food here but I can definitively say that I loved the idea, approach, and potential for changing the midlevel culinary scene in Chicago.Little Goat takes American diner familiars and gives them a twist, sometimes a big one, that pushes your horizons a little bit. Celebrity chefs like Stephanie Izard are smart to use their influence to teach in this way. Some goat milk in your latte? Kim chi in your hash? Brandade gravy with your biscuits? Loved the ideas flying around here and that goat milk latte was delicious btw.Diner was very clean, and though in an old location was so updated and contemporary on the inside. Beautiful archictectural light fixture in the center. Unified theme. Cute waitress uniforms. Great service."
"It's clear that Little Goat is the product of some very experienced restaurant-industry people putting their heads together and making a simply great dining experience for their guests.  Stephanie and her team are doing a lot of really smart things that others haven't thought of, or don't care enough to do, like accommodating those that inevitably wait a long time for a table by guiding them to the ""store"", where they can watch the bakers do their thing through the glass, and order a separate coffee or beer or wine, or even a delicious pastry, while they wait.As for the food itself, everything was delicious.Machos Nachos - ridiculously amazing.  Some of the best I've ever had.""Smoked"" fries - cool concept, but didn't taste any smokiness at all, so could be skipped.As for the sandwiches, some menu items have a ""wow"" factor for their originality, but a lot of them are actually quite in line with what you'd expect at a diner, like a turkey club or a burger, but elevated to another level due to carefully sourced, quality ingredients being expertly handled.  Didn't try any breakfast items but LOVE that they are served all day.  Again, they really have a handle on what diners want."
"Five stars for being the most overhyped, overpriced douchebag fests in the city.- five stars for being the most overhyped, overpriced douchebag fests in the city.After an hour wait drinking beer in the ""cafe"" section and snacking on cubes of delicious bread, we were sat at the counter. I am not sure if they are shooting for a hipster irony or are truly trying to recreate an American diner experience, either way the feel of the room and the flow of the room fail miserably.  The room is deafening by design, silly if you ask me.  There is something to be said of the energy of a room, but when a designer does everything they can to force noise into your space it just gets annoying.Corned beef hash, squiggly soggy potatoes tossed with paper thin slices of decent corned beef, the dish was bland, the eggs were over cooked, and I was looking for something to counter the dense flavorless mass. My girl had the Brandade and pork belly with kimchee, way over thought with chewy pork belly and runny brandade.  This chef does wonderful things and is ann amazing talent, unfortunately whoever is funding this thing is running the show.  This menu reads like her concept and Leona's execution.I did enjoy watching the girl next to me pick all the onions out of her grilled cheese, when asked if she would like anything else she said ""no, this is fine"" in such a defeated voice.  I imagine like many of the five star reviews here on Yelp after dropping $60 of breakfast refuse to admit they have been food raped. Between all the hype and all the mediocrity who can blame them.I would have complained, albeit futile sometime it is fun just to see the waiter scramble to save a possible lost tip.  I didn't, we never were asked how anything was, we were told how good it is.For my money there are twenty better places, try Tavernita for no wait and super quality brunch with a Spanish twist. Or go hang out with the other morons in front of Yolk for more mediocrity and hype."
This place is fantastic. We've been here about 10 times for brunch. Great atmosphere. We always bring our out of town guests. And they are super kid friendly which was really unexpected. We have little ones and finding babysitters for brunch is not an option. Nice to know you can bring them along. I think I've tried everything savory so far. My favorite is the bulls eye french toast and my husbands favorite is the bacon toffee milkshake (chocolate is infused with pig face drippings from across the way!). Great coffee. Fun kids cups. Bakery is awesome. I think the only disappointing thing I've had here is the oatmeal.
"First of all...absolutely love a place that serves breakfast all day...even if I'm not eating it. Came here for a really late lunch so tried out Los Drowned - the avocado makes this sandwich - a goat burger, and the smoked fries - which stole the show. Can't wait to come back for brunch or possibly the rooftop Rose tasting later this month."
"Food was very tasty, EXCELLENT service (Camille), and the atmosphere was aces. My boyfriend had the nachos as an entree; this I would NOT recommend, they are far too rich for one person to eat alone. DELICIOUS, but he felt kind of sick when it was over. I had the chickpea salad-amazing; not a healthy option really with its fritters and fried onions but I who is going there for a healthy dinner. Finally the brussel sprouts are a must have. Please, do yourself a favor; so tangy, and crispy...mmmmmmmm! Overall, my review is great vibe and rich food with excellent service. Oh I almost forgot about the turtle pie. Quite possibly the best desert I have ever had."
"This place was just meh for me.  I liked the idea of upscale-diner and it definitely feels like a diner with the large menu and the counter area and booths, but it also feels trendy and hip.  We go here on a Friday around 7:30 pm and we had to wait a few minutes for a booth.  The host was very nice.  The menu is huge with all diner favorites.  Of course a lot of dishes included goat, but surprisingly a lot of dishes were korean-inspired or korean fusion.  We ordered a cheesy-crab dip to start, and that was a big disappointment.  It was just cheese dip w/ what seemed like a tiny crab flavor.  There was no crab chunks or anything.  We asked the server and he said it comes like that.  My korean goat burger was subpar.  It just lacked flavor.  You could taste the kimchi and there was a lot of it, but it was americanized version of kimchi and it was too weak to stand up to the patty and bun.  The patty/bacon/egg was thick but too bland.  I usually complain about bacon being too salty, but this time everything was bland.  I've never had a goat burger, and the meat was not as good and a bit dryer than beef.  We got fries to share, and it was just potato crumbs.  I thought it might just be like that, but I looked at other tables, and they got long stringy fries.Our server was nice and all, but not great.  Every time we asked a question or for a recommendation, he just said ""whatever you like"".  Should goat meat be medium rare?  ""however you like it"".  I liked the atmosphere.  A bit loud as you'd expect, but it's relaxed trendy place.  Would be a cool place for a date.The bathroom was itneresting.  The door to it basically blends into the wall. So even if you're staring right at it, you can't see it unless you're looking for the handle.  Once you go in, there are 4 separate bathroom rooms.  That was nice."
All I have to say is Fat Elvis Waffles are amazing. I wish I had this kind of fatty diner near me in California.
"Stephanie Izzard's other place in Chicago. It's a done up diner right across from Girl & the Goat.What I like about most of the dishes at Little Goat is the very slight Asian flavoring that doesn't actually make it Asian but adds a very nice sensation to your palate.Crisp Shrimp cocktail, Sloppy Goat and the Hot Crab Dip are my favorites here. The service has usually been good, and I've never had to actually wait to be seated even on Thursday and Friday evenings. If anything, go by the 'bar' or the communal table. The quality of food is, naturally, still the same!Note - Little Goat recently opened shop at the Chicago French Market!!"
"Good food. I had some french toast with egg inside of it. Definitely one of the more unique things I've ever eaten. Food's a bit pricey and it was super crowded when it first opened (seems to still be pretty crowded around lunch time), but I'd go there again. Seating is plentiful and the food actually is really good."
"To start, we were quoted a 45 minute wait that ended up being nearly two hours. The host didn't apologize or take the initiative to keep us updated. We found out by repeatedly going back and asking. I understand this place is popular. I understand a wait is to be expected. But if the quoted wait time is more than half an hour off, a free cookie or pastry or coffee would be the nice thing to do. If I hadn't been there with friends, I would've left for sure. Food wise, this place is decent. The menu is creative. I had the pork belly pancake. It was a slab of pork belly on top of a crispy scallion pancake then covered with an Asian slaw. My husband had the Bull's eye French toast. It was two pieces of bread with a sunny side up fried egg inside the bread. Then it was covered with pieces of fried chicken fingers in a pool of bacon maple syrup. They were going for the salty sweet thing but it was overpowered by the sweet. The chicken breading needed to be saltier to balance out the syrup. Others in my party had the Spanish omelet, brandade and pork belly, and paratha burrito. They all enjoyed their meals. The food came out really fast and our server was friendly. If there was no wait, I'd give this place four stars."
"Delicious ! The wait staff was very friendly. The men in the bakery were helpful answering questions about the types of bread available. Bought Peter Piper and a jar of pickled peppers! So glad I did, because I toasted the bread this am and had a fried farm fresh egg and a side of the pickled peppers and it was just a perfect extension of yesterday's visit there! I ordered the Asian shrimp salad. It was very good. It was basically a lot of coleslaw with flavorful shrimp on it. I want the try the noodle wrapped shrimp next time! Will go back."
"I had been here two times prior to this visit (once for dinner right after it opened and once for brunch in Jan 2014). Sadly, this time I was completely underwhelmed both in the service and food aspects. My past 2 experiences were great and I was constantly raving about Little Goat and Stephanie Izard's talent. However, this time I ordered the reuben and it was very average. It had housemade Kraut but it was pickled for too long, I had to pick mine off my sandwich. Further, parts of the corned beef were incredibly overcooked.  Our server was also pretty MIA, we had to stop her a couple times to get water refills, etc because she was not attentive.  In short, not a good experience. Not sure if everyone was off their game or what, because this experience stood in stark contrast to my other fantastic experiences at Little Goat.*I was going to give 2, however the rest of my party didn't have any problems with their food. So I assumed it was just my reuben and gave a 3 instead."
"I'm a G&tG fan from way back, and Little Goat is a close runner up for my favourite eating hole in Chicago. But I was there with a group of friends yesterday and experienced my first goat mis-step. The fried pickles and onion ring dish left all three of us feeling a bit queasy and unable to finish the plate. I don't know what it is - we're all hearty ladies with no delicate sensibilities in relation to fried foods - but all three of us felt roofied by this dish, even the next day, and to the point where we could barely touch our entrees. Very odd, guys, very odd indeed. The fish tostadas - which I'd tried prior - were a bit muddy and...bland. I don't know if the entire kitchen staff were on vacay and you had a skeleton crew step in or what, but this is the first time in my many forays to an Izard restaurant where I've not been at the very least slightly blown away. It doubly sucked because it appears there's been a price raise in everything (including the merch I finally got around to purchasing), which led to a case of the sad face.The five stars is because you're so very typically excellent. I have dreams of your kimchee reuben, the fact that you carry Stumptown cold brews, the goat milk in your lattes, your blood orange meringue pie (which I always order to go because I cannot live without it), the everything-else-because-everything-here-is-so-so-­good, and your roller-derby-goth-punk-princess uniforms that house the friendliest and funnest and most affable staff a restaurant could hope to boast.Never thought I'd write anything negative about one of my favourites, and I will always love you Stephanie - for your non-pretentious culinary genius, because I always see you walking around your restaurant/s like a mortal, for always surprising me with something I've never tasted before, for injecting a sense of true euphoria into the ritual of food with friends - so please don't be bummed if you (actually) read this review. Everyone has a bad day, even those who are truly great."
"This review is just for the Pork Belly Pancake ($12) - after reading all of the raving Yelp reviews for it I knew I had to order it.  I found the whole dish to be very greasy.  I know that pork belly is fatty, but it was an oily pancake with a piece of fat on top and some salad.  I don't think the flavors tasted special or blended particularly well, and the whole thing was just overwhelmed by grease.    Disappointing.I tasted some of the reuben and thought it was basically a normal reuben with kimchi.  I think the prices are too high for lunch, although the portions are large.The decor is 5 stars, this place is adorable.  Everyone there seemed to be having a good time and the service was friendly.  Just kind of expensive and the food was not good."
"The food was good.  More than just your basic diner menu, but still a diner.  I'd go again, but I probably wouldn't make a special effort to go -  not a big believer in need to book a reservation a few days out to eat a burger."
"The service is slow, the place is loud and there seems to be a lot of people who work there walking around doing nothing but all is forgiven because of the fantastic vegan menu. When we arrived at the last minute (intended to go with the family to Wishbone but it is closed for dinner on Sundays) I was surprised when they asked if we needed four ""regular menus"". Turns out they have a gluten free menu, a dairy free menu and vegan menu in addition to their regular menu. I ordered three things from the vegan menu was impressed by everything I ate and can't wait to go back and try everything else. Kid friendly too (although out of 6 entree orders the last to arrive, by quite a bit, was from the kid's menu for a 2 year old. Bring his out first. There were tears). With a kid's menu, crayons and special cups with lids. They also have high chairs and booster chairs. After a visit to Dillman's long ago I don't take that for granted. I'll be back to Little Goat for sure."
"we came on a monday and were seated immediately at the bar, we orderedhot crab diplos drowned - bestpork belly pancaketempura mashed potatoeseverything was SO GOOD! espeically the sandwiches! can't wait to come back!"
"We spent the evening in the private dining area at Little Goat last night.  It was classy, yet comfortable.  All of the food was absolutely on point.  If you have the budget, this is a fabulous area for a private event.  Everybody was in awe the entire night."
"Honesty time starts now.I had high expectations as did everyone else in the city of Chicago b/c it's Stephanie Izard so it must be fantastic. Wrong.It's a diner and it's in the West Loop so perhaps that makes it cooler to some but not to me.  It's also disappointing b/c I love diners.  They are cozy and offer comfort food but this just did not impress.I came for dinner.  I will give a high five to the marketing dude/gal who developed the menu b/c  the items SOUND good on the menu but execution is poor.Hot crab dip - It didn't taste bad but it didn't taste that amazing either.  It reminded me of what my parents would serve at a party when the Bears went to the SuperBowl in 1986.  The take-away point here is that it is old school and not inventive at all. Furthermore, it was served with Ritz crackers.  I'm not hating on Ritz but seriously, you couldn't have come up with a more inventive cracker than a freaking Ritz?Pork Belly Pancake:  2 thumbs down!  I don't drool over pork belly like some but I do like it.  This concoction was SO dry.  It was supposed to be mixed with a ginger maple dressing but it felt like I was eating raw cabbage, dry pork belly and a crap scallion pancake.Taco Salad: I know what you are thinking, who orders a taco salad but my co-diner was ""trying"" to be healthy.  Now, I make taco salads all the time. Am I an expert? NO. Do I make a better taco salad than Little Goat? Hell yes.  This was a mosh of warm, wilted lettuce topped with a ridiculous amount of chili. It was sick as in TERRIBLE.  My advice....try the breakfast menu.  I may give it one more go-around just to see.And if you want a real diner with real comfort food, go to Silver Cloud in Bucktown."
"We are followers of Stephanie Izzard, therefore, needed to try this place out after hearing so much buzz.  Diner food made fancy-that's how I can describe it.  We loved that we could have breakfast food for lunch but not have it be the typical pancakes, waffles, etc. option.  Lots of good kid options, although the mac and cheese was WAY too cheesy for the kids and too strong of a flavor."
"Since I loved Girl & the Goat, I had high expectations of this place.  A group of my girlfriends and I went at 9am. Please note: you need your whole party to sit even if the restaurant is half full. They won't sit incomplete parties. The atmophere and look of the place is super cute & what I kind of expected. The breakfast/brunch menu was a bit different ( a breakfast burrito w an indian twist). We ordered:-cinnamon bun to split-hash brown to split-Bullseye French Toast-Fat Elvis Waffle (I think that is what it was called)-Bagel with Honey Masala- Corned Beef & Hash. To be honest, I was expecting things to be so well balanced like G&TG and to have such great flavor. Not the case.The Cinnamon bun was okay, but Ann Sather has them knocked out in this round. The hash brown was sooooo overly salted despite the goat cheese mixed in. The French Toast was super sweet. Like overtly sweet that we only ate half of the order. The Fat Elvis Waffle was also super sweet and what it was expected. The bagel and the spread was very bland. I felt that the bagel was a bit tough. Perhaps, Lunch/Dinner is better at this joint but with so many brunch options in the city. I'd rather go elsewhere."
"My friend saw me carrying a bag from Little Goat Bread and asked me how Little Goat was. My response? ""Underwhelming.""But here's the thing. I LIKED Little Goat.I STILL like Little Goat.I will absolutely go back to Little Goat.But I will probably not order what I ordered today.So here's how this nonsense went down:My friend Paige posted a picture on twitter of one of Little Goat's adorable branded coffee cups and my brain went, ""YOU should go to Little Goat."" And I was all, ""Shut up brain, I'm trying to go back to sleep."" But my brain wouldn't shut up about diner food and the fact that it's Stephanie Izard diner food and finally I got out of bed and got on the train.The actually building that houses Little Goat is adorable - with special adorable points given to the cute cute spinning 3D goat sign on top of the place. And the inside is bright and airy with an enormous copper-beamed skylight in the middle and big communal tables and a lovely counter bar that features those sexy Edison bulbs in big glass domes overhead. It's well designed and for a place that manages to squeeze a LOT of people inside it - it doesn't feel cramped.And then there's the actual Little Goat branding - which is so cute and well done that I could throw up. The logo is adorable and EVERYWHERE. It's on the windows and the plates and the coffee cups and the to go bags and everywhere without being overwhelming. Again, this place gets some serious design points.My server was lovely and I wish I could remember her name but she was dark-haired and had glasses was attentive and helpful. Homegirl gets five stars, easy.The part that brings it down to 3 stars instead of 5 is, sadly, the food.I know, I know. I'm just as sad to type that as you are to read it.I ordered what's called ""Bull's Eye French Toast"" - which is basically ""egg in a basket"" only with bomb ass sweet onion brioche with an egg cooked in it. Served with it is fried chicken and bbq maple syrup and gooseberries. So it's basically a combination of chicken & waffles, french toast, and egg in a basket - all of which are totally lovely things. So I had some reasonably high expectations.Only when I cut into the toast, expecting a runny yolk - I got a whole runny, raw egg. And when I say ""raw"" I mean - ""the whites were still clear because they had not been cooked"". So now I have a plate full of raw egg and syrup and french toast that I'm suddenly super wary about eating because it's covered in raw egg.And it was something like, $15.Add another $2 for coffee and a tip and I just paid $22 for coffee and french toast with super uncooked eggs.The Little Goat is, before it's a Stephanie Izard restaurant, a restaurant.And what's more, it's a DINER.When cooks at a diner can't make eggs, something is not right.That said, I will go back. But I will order something different. And I will bring a friend and make them split it with me to keep costs down because...damn."
"Me and my coworker felt something when we first entered little Goat; something off. We came to the conclusion that it was simply the fact that this place comes across as trying to hard. Hard to buy into a traditional diner experience when the spinning goat on top of the restaurant literally cost as much as the restaurant itself.Food ordered: Beef sandwich - great, lot of flavor and tender beef.Apple pancakes: Really good. The cream cheese spread on top was awesome.Fried pickles and onion rings - small portion but came with curry mustard which was amazing.Pork cutlet sandwich - Personally didn't try, but diner thought it was good.Various milkshakes including pork-toffee. Was interesting and maybe even good, wouldn't get it again though and don't understand why they're $7 each.Portions where surprisingly large, overall nice experience."
"I'll give it an ok, good food but a little pricey for what you get. The decor is really nice although, I'd say its probably a good place for a boozing breakfast with friends like other places on Randolph.  Solo breakfast before work... nah."
"SOOO AMAZING!! The entrees here are so unique and flavorful you just won't find anything else like them in Chicago.The French Toast was soooooo goood!! It melts in your mouth. It also has a fried egg INSIDE of the french toast! How?!? I don't care it's sooo good!We also got the Crab Dip which is AMAZING! You have to get it for an app!The Home Fries were soo good too. These are not just your normal french fries.. They are smoked and have an awesome flavor to them that you have never experienced anywhere else, I promise. You don't even need ketchup they are so good.We also got the Fat Boy which was HUGE, it reminded me of a Perrys sandwich, it was great. I am definitely coming back here!"
"Came here before dinner for a couple of appetizers with my Bro and the new Sous-chef over at G&G for a couple of appetizers and drinks before going out.  Such a beautiful patio.  Can't say enough about the place in regards to the decor.  The beer list is cool, cocktail list extensive, and people are all on the same page.  The food though is hit or miss.  The crab dip is unbelievable!  So I have to say that that's worth snagging.  Other than that, the pulled pork etc. was just ok.  Regardless, its a really nice place for a couple drinks before heading across the street."
"I haven't been to Girl and the Goat yet so I came here with no predisposed opinion.  Defintely was excited to have a breakfast spot on Randolph since all the restaurants there are mostly for dinner.  Its definietely a nice addition to restaurant row.  For all the buzz around the restaurant, I didnt have to wait long on my 1st visit, which by the way was on a Saturday afternoon.  They update you about your table/wait via text.  Cool.  Waited about 20-25 minutes.1st visit:Parathas Burrito:  Was ok.. not a fan of the kidney beans it came with.  Fat Elvis Waffle:  Shared by the table (Myself, mom and the BF)   I love waffles, i love bananas, I love peanut butter, i like bacon.. you'd think this would be great, right?  Eh.. it was waaaaaay too sweet!!  I suggest you order the syrup on the side because the waffle was drowned in syrup and i could only nibble off the ends.  Too much!The Coffee shop:  Didn't buy anything but walked in here while i waited.. it smelled incredible!  Definitely want to come back and try the coffee or a pastry! 2nd Visit (came w friends who wanted to check out the place):Since i wasn't really hungry I ordered the tomato-apple soup.  It comes with a side of what reminds me of a quesadilla on flour tortilla.  I really enjoyed this.  The soup was hearty not too tomato-y.  Would def order again.Little Goat Coffee:  Mmmm soooo yummy!  Its sweetened with goats milk.  Yum!  Bottom Line:  Eh.. Overhyped and Underwhelmed   When the sides are the standout i think you have a problem.  Its definitely nice to have a diner/breakfast spot on restaurant row but it just didnt do it for me.  Specially for the prices.  Oh .. the place is also very family friendly.  Lots of families with their kids in there."
"BUZZ- Bulls Eye French Toast (4/10)I ALSO TRIED- Crumpets with Chorizo Maple Syrup (3/10)- Hot Crab Dip (7/10)- Tempura Mashed Potatoes (3/10)- Fat Elvis Waffles (10/10)- Smoked Pork & Toffee Crunch (2/10)So, Stephanie, we meet again! No, actually, I've never met her, but I have been to Girl & The Goat, and was not impressed. After a night of beers and Mortal Kombat at The Emporium (cool place!), decided to have late night diner food at Little Goat. A friend told us about it, and it was like, ""Ok, cool, let's go!"" But only afterwards did I find out how popular this place was! So, like a madman, I ordered everything that I saw mentioned more than once on Yelp, and ironically, the one 10/10 item here wasn't one I ordered. :/BULLS EYE FRENCH TOASTAccording to our server, this was one of the more popular items, so I had to get it. It's french toast with bbq maple syrup, sweet onion brioche, and crispy chicken. You get like 3 pieces of french toast, but they're small, like french bread slices, not Texas toast. There's syrup, and the fact that it's bbq doesn't really make too much of a difference, and you get like 5 pieces of crispy chicken. And no, it's not like 5 individual pieces of popcorn chicken, no no no. It's like a big McDonald's chicken nugget cut into 5 pieces. This was pathetic! Had they used actual McD's nuggets, I would've been happier, but the chicken was dry, and probably from Tyson's at Costco or something. The french toast was just french toast, nothing spectacular about it at all!CRUMPETSDo you know what crumpets are? I didn't, and I still think I don't know! Essentially, it's a biscuit shaped chewy pancake, though part of me though it tasted more like a biscuit. Anyway, this was basically pancakes with syrup and chorizo. The chorizo was very weak. Not spicy, not flavorful, but really dull. In fact, it added some gamy flavor to it, without hiding it in its seasonings and spices. When I swept the chorizo off, it was actually halfway decent, but this dish is just terrible and worthless!HOT CRAB DIPIt's a small dish of crab dip, and then bordered by a single layer of Ritz crackers. Problem is, the amount of crab dip you get is pretty good, but you get like 8 Ritz crackers, which is hardly enough to have half. You pretty much have to mound it on the cracker if you want to use it all up. We didn't, so I used the rest to flavorize my tempura mashed potato. The crab dip is good. It's cheesy, seafoody, and salty enough. Wasn't spectacular, but it was good. I might consider getting it again if I ever came back.TEMPURA MASHED POTATOESOk, imagine eating mashed potatoes by itself, without gravy. Got that bland taste in your mouth? Ok, now wrap the mashed potatoes in a layer of tempura batter and fry it. Now how is it? The same, right? The tempura really didn't add much. They serve it on a tray with some sauces drawn out so you can do that, but it's not really that good. I'd consider this a side-grade to regular ol' mashed potatoes. Quick Tip, though, it's decent if you put crab dip on top of it. It lends some of the salt and flavors to it.FAT ELVIS WAFFLESThis is the only thing I didn't order, but since I shared all these other things, a friend gave me half of his order. This was AMAZING! It's waffles with bacon maple syrup, fresh cut bananas and peanut butter-butter. Wow! The waffles start out crunchy, and the maple bacon syrup give it its sweet and smoky flavor. That alone, would have made it a 6/10. The bananas are so ripe and sweet and add a really good flavor to the whole bite. That ups it to 7/10! Then the peanut butter-butter. The thought of peanut butter on a waffle is not something I ever even thought of. The butter really does taste like peanut butter, but you don't have to worry about trying to spread it. It melts just like butter, and it really does taste like warm gooey peanut butter. That peanut butter flavor plus the waffle and syrup would have made it a 10/10, but the fact that it also compliments the bananas so well, makes this probably the best waffle I've ever had! SMOKED PORK & TOFFEE CRUNCHThis is a milkshake. They have to do something about pork fat and then take it across the street where they turn it into gelato or something, and then bring it back for the toffee. Ok, straight up, this is disgusting. The description made me want to gag (I asked for the description after I ordered), and you taste vanilla smokey pork fat! EW! I had some people try it, nobody liked it, and since it cost like $6, I had to just down it, so I did. The toffee crunch was very good, but the rest of the shake was disgusting! Never again!ONE LUCKY GOATIt really pains me to have to give this place 5 stars. The Elvis Waffles are so damn good that I was craving them the day after! And that's why I have to give it 5 stars. The problem is, everything else was so bad or mediocre, and it pains me that what would have been a 2 star rating  is now a 5! This is one lucky goat!"
"Came here after we were informed of the 2 hour wait at one of the restaurants nearby. They have a bar with full menu service at the back (next to where they bake the bread & behind the coffee bar) that was open seating, so we hung out for a minute and sat at the bar when seats opened up.Very good beers (although they're marked up from what you'd pay for the same beer elsewhere), and I had the goat chili cheese fries which pretty much changed my life.(The bartender also let me sample the Mezcal cocktail - French Intervention - after I asked him a question about the squeeze bottle that it turned out contained special house grenadine, and it was spectacular.)"
"Little Goat is GOATThe diner has a very effective sunroof, which is in stark contrast to that dim love cave across the street (I do love that love cave though).The food:Crab dip: very rich and tasty. My favorite. Ask for extra Ritz crackers because you will be scouring the plate and probably the table for a drop of that creamy goodness.Asian thingy: A tasty take on egg pancake with kimchi and bacon.Tempura Mashed potatoes: Do you like mashed potatoes? Tempura fry that shizz! Eggcellent."
"Had heard great things about Girl & the Goat (obviously), but this sounded like it would hit the spot for lunch versus a fancier meal (and long wait list) at G&TG.Even at 2pm on a Thursday, we were told that there was going to be a 40 minute wait.  Bit ridiculous, but we had already trekked over so wanted to wait--they actually use a seat waiting app so was nice to see how many people were in front of us.  We ended up getting seated only about 15 minutes later since there were only two of us.Got the fried pickles as an appetizer--SO GOOD.  I could have eaten an entire plate myself.  I would love to know what's in their batter.  It looked like there were some interesting things like fennel or caraway rye seeds.  Anyway, they were awesome.Then had the goat burger Loco Moco style (jasmine rice, egg, sweet and sour).  There's no bun on these burgers, more the burger placed on top of the other stuff.  Was delicious!  Also a big portion that I didn't end up finishing.Also had the tempura mashed potatoes as a side.  These are deep fried into a cube; were very filling but not as amazing as the other stuff.  The tempura sauce on top was a great flavor to mix with them.Overall, despite the long wait this place is for sure worth it.  I wouldn't suggest it with a big group as they don't take reservations and I imagine the wait would be very long.  Also it is designed to be very stereotypically diner looking, so I wouldn't suggest it for a date.  But go with a friend and pig out on the deliciousness."
"Very strange place.  The decor and lighting makes it seam as if this is a place out of an 80s TV show.The menu is quite adventurous, great blends of flavor like fermented foods and peanut butter. French toast with peanut butter and fried chicken was pretty bomb.  I've heard lunch or dinner is better than brunch."
"I went to Little Goat Diner with grand expectations, as I had gone to the one at the French Market and loved it. I went to Little Goat Diner for brunch and found that it has a slightly different interpretation of breakfast than what I am used to. This may or may not appeal to you. When I go out for breakfast, I like to see creative, and innovative items, yet I still want to have plentiful selections of more traditional breakfast dishes (with a twist). Little Goat has few ""traditional"" items, and has reinvented breakfast - which for some could be a good thing, but for me, it's a bit too fussy.  I will say that they do have more traditional items when it comes to sweet breakfast items like pancakes and french toast. As a savory breakfast lover (eggs, omelets), there wasn't much of a selection that I was interested in tasting. The one omelette that I was interested in was sold out, so I opted for the ""Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing""  - it was tasty, but I wouldn't order it again. It just didn't satisfy my breakfast craving for more of an egg-based dish. My friend ended up making her own omelet, which she enjoyed, but I like there to be more omelet selections that were designed by the chef vs. me trying to piece something together, hoping that it tastes good. This place was incredibly popular - I came in around 11:30am on a Saturday and had a SOLID one hour wait. I was getting hungry so went over to the bakery section and got a muffin and tea, which was very helpful, as I was starting to get ""hangry"" (so hungry that you start to get angry).  The bakery area is a very nice touch. Overall, I think that Little Goat Diner is good, but I won't be rushing back for brunch. I may try it again for lunch or dinner."
"As a huge Top Chef fan, I was so excited to come here. I went for breakfast on a weekend, so there was a pretty long wait. I didn't mind too much because I expected it, but it's never fun to wait. They don't take reservations, so you have to be prepared for that. I got the Elvis waffles & they blew me away. It's not often that breakfast food really gets you, but holy crap was it good!"
"I was like a lazy male lion, waiting for the females to bring back the kill. As soon as the nachos were placed in front of me all I could think was ""Get in my belly!"" in Fatbastard's voice. They were that good. Like a midget was to Fatbastard described as ""The other, other white meat,"" those nachos filled a void in my life I never knew existed. So yummy. So buttery. So cheesy in a goat kind of way.   As the empty plates were cleared away, time for my entree. I was feeling quite dead sexy at this time. You see, my belly was reaching epic proportions;gas was flying. Although as much as I tried, the food had won. I was so uncomfortably full. I could only thank god I was going to be wearing scrubs for the next 12 hours. Now after my glutinous ways at LG, I do not think I could exhibit any deftness in a sumo wresting match. Ill leave that to Mr Fatbastard. Then Ill slim down at Subway."
"We rented a car specifically to come here in subzero temperatures. Okay, we *might* have had the car from the day before and an 11 o'clock turn in time the follow morning, but still, we took advantage!  We woke up early Sunday, it was frigid and I couldn't wait any longer to try out this place!  And did not leave disappointed.  Seated right away in a booth and coffee served.  Stumptown coffee is AMAZING if you've never had it before, and unlimited refills of it?  Even better.The kitchen was bustling, of course with Stephanie right alongside everyone back there, flipping pancakes. Our waitress was a doll.  There were children EVERYWHERE.  Which I was surprised at, but upon further paying attention, it seems that was expected.  They had their own goat coloring activities and goat sippy cups for their drinks.  My wife couldn't resist the temptation of the Bull's Eye French Toast - french toast made with onion brioche served with chicken, gooseberries and a BBQ maple syrup.  Delish and rich!  The only complaint she had was that she wished she had known an egg was inside that had a runny yoke.  Not being one for the yoke in a sunny-side up egg, a personal preference, and being in the minority of the rest of the diners, it's all good.I tried the interesting sounding Parathas Burrito - na'an with eggs and an avocado and kidney bean salad.  I was scared when it was put on the table - the chili dressing had a strong vinegar smell for that early in the morning, but the arrangement of tastes together?  It totally worked!We cannot wait to come back for lunch, though I'm not sure if there's a time that won't have a wait.  Come 8:30 am on a Sunday this place was packed.  The bakery next door is great with more of that friendly service.  We bought a broccoli cheese bread that smelled just like the soup (and YUM!) and her Saute sauce which makes those stellar green beans at Girl and the Goat.  We will for certain be back - and way to go for having what seems to be the only breakfast option in this area!  Cute space, great staff and phenomenal food.  Izard did it again!"
"I tried to come here one Sunday afternoon; said there was about a 90 min wait so I said I'd wait.  I love that they send you a link so you can track and see when your turn is coming up.  We ended up somewhere else that time, but I came back on a Monday morning and got in right away.  Per the suggestion of the server, I got the Smoked Corned Beef and Hash with Eggs. AMAZING. SIMPLY AMAZING.  It was so good, the corned beef is apparently smoked for a few days, and it was incredible.  I didn't eat all my food so I took it home and it was just as good the second time.  I'm looking forwarding to making my second trip back!"
"I don't mind spending dough on a nice meal and drinks, and this comes from an unemployed gal who always had to count her pennies, even with a job in hand.And I am a big fan of Stephanie and her first address on Randolph. I actually always put my dinners at G&tG in my top-5 dining experiences.Besides, goats are so cute that they should be the new cats. Well, baby goats at least.(In need of evidence? Look no further: recursivities.tumblr.com…; excuse the F bombs scattered all over the page, but the images were just too much to resist)But I am sorry to report that this little guy doesn't quite live up to the hype. And believe me, it's a sad thing to say...but love comes with honesty. So there it is.I went for breakfast, and was enchanted by the lovely atmosphere, cute wallpaper and stylish light fixtures - as far away from a greasy diner as you can imagine. The place is luminous, welcoming and warm with booths galore to please the hard-core crowds.Here where I stop the romance though: the à la carte menu. When you have to build your own breakfast by picking and choosing items from different sections, this is:1. extremely painful to deal with early in the morning;2. quite damaging to your wallet, which ends up being confused and asking you with reproachful eyes if it's dinner or breakfast you are paying for (yes, wallets are people, too);My parathas burrito was tasty and inventive, and I enjoyed it quite much: Indian flatbread, eggs, an avocado and bean salad smothered in chili pepper sauce. At $12, it's on the expensive side of things but not overtly so. But my friend and I decided to split a plate of hashbrowns sprinkled with goat cheese as our indulgence of the day, and for $5 we received a serving so small that it wouldn't have been enough to feed a child. $5 for what was amounting to 3/4 of a a potato with 1/4 ounce of cheese (at most) is outrageous in my book.Two breakfast entrees, the said hashbrowns, and two coffees ended up costing us just over $43. And no diner breakfast, as goat-y as it can be, is worth that price.Since I heard that it's the same song for dinner, and that you have to order your side on top of your sammie, I won't be back. Despite the wonderful staff and all the cutesy going on.A harsh 2-star but a 2-star all the same."
"The Little Goat Diner is located in the trendy west Randolph St. restaurant row area.  It is the companion restaurant to the Girl & The Goat located on the opposite side of Randolph St.  The Little Goat is open daily from 7:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. and serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Reservations are not accepted.  The restaurant consists of one large, plainly decorated dining room and an adjacent bakery with a coffee and alcohol bar.Our party consisted of four first-time customers.  We arrived on a Sunday morning around 10:15 a.m. and confronted a long waiting line of people jammed inside the front door.  We were told our wait time was approximately 35 - 40 minutes.  Although I usually don't wait in line for that length of time, I made an exception because the other folks in our party didn't want to tramp around in the cold winter weather looking for another place.  As it turned out, we were seated close to an hour later.  We were given a booth that was very tight.  A very low, thin partition separated our booth from the one next to us, which had the effect of being at a communal table.  The place was packed with customers mostly in their 20s and 30s, many of whom were accompanied by very small children.  Chairs and highchairs were squeezed in at the ends of many of the booths and tables that limited the aisles spaces considerably and created obstacle courses for the patrons and the service staff.  The noise level was extremely high and the atmosphere was frenetic.  As to the food, I am not clear on what this restaurant is trying to achieve with regard to the type of cuisine it's serving.  Is it southern American, Asian, French or just some kind of hodgepodge?  Whatever it is, it's very overpriced (its website doesn't show prices).  Not being enthused with any of the offerings, I settled on the Brandade and Belly 'Benedict.'  This turned out to be extremely disappointing.  The pork belly that was substituted for regular ham was fatty and it didn't have much of a taste nor did the crumbly biscuit base, but at least this part of the dish was warm.  Not so with the kimchi on top that was very cold.  The flavor and temperature mixtures didn't work and left me wondering what they were trying to accomplish with this concoction.  Our servers were harried and table service was slow but friendly.  Restrooms are hard to find and you can expect to wait in line.  Metered street parking exists but is very difficult to find, and expensive valet parking is available. One visit to the Little Goat was enough for me."
"Mexican omelet was watery and tasteless. 5th time here and very disappointed. I have recommended this place to others, but I think I'll try other newly opened options on Randolph in the future."
"To summarize: Gross and very much like a salt lickWe had a pretty awful dinner here last night. The service was fine and the environment was nice but the food was unacceptable. We ordered:Sloppy Goat: Essentially just ground goat with loads of salt, bun was dry and tasteless despite the fact that they have their own bakery in house. Also the bread to meat ratio was off. Lots of bread, not enough meat on each bite. Ultimately even when taken apart neither element was edible.Korean Burger: Bun dry and mealy. Beef patty was dry and salty in a very not delicious way. Kim Chi; not bad, had better.Tuna Melt: Described by a friend as the worst tuna melt ever.In conclusion, I know you're tempted to go given the buzz, but save your money and taste buds from this fiasco. The whole experience was so foul that we ultimately ended up having a group therapy session about it all."
Stopped in without a reservation at an odd time and was still packed but luckily found two spots at the cute little bar ! Food was absolutely delicious ! I got the veggie quesadillas and my husband got the sloppy goat ! I think that was one of the best meals I've ever had ! Different and unique flavors were incredible. We also split the smoked fries recommended by bartender and were amazing ! I will def come back to try more food ;)
"I was lucky enough to get invited to the ""friends & family night"" before the official opening.  My friend knew one of the chefs working so we got to sit right at the bar in front of the line.  It was quite an awesome experience.  The menu is quite interesting with your typical diner fare but with a gourmet and complex twist.  We all had some drinks... gals chose the champagne and boys had some local brews.  The food was pretty darn good... we had some apps to start and each orderd a unique burger.  They ran out of some of the apps we wanted to try which was disappointing but the ones we got were great.  I had the caesar burger which is made on crouton bread with a side of the mac n cheese.  My friend had the asian burger and fries.  The Little Goat coffee was unreal.  I cannot wait to go back and try more!"
"This elegant diner serves large, flavorful portions of comfort food.  Love the laid back atmosphere and I thoroughly enjoyed the brandade & belly with eggs and biscuits - amazing flavors, perfectly complemented by the cool, spicy kick of kimchee. They also have a little bread shop next door, with a window into the workshop."
"I actually worked with Stephanie a few times with my job at Le Cordon Bleu. Ironically I never ate at her establishments, but understanding her passion for food I figured it would transfer to her place. I was right, I really love this place the vibe the menu it is very now. If you are a true foodie you won't be disappointed. Expect a wait on the weekends at least 30-45 mins. They have a cool area with a bar, and cafe while you wait that helps. Oh and the text to alert you of your table is a good touch. Highly recommend trying it out."
"So, keeping in mind that I'm a vegetarian, I only ordered scrambled eggs and hash browns.  And, like, I don't want to give away the surprise for you (but I will), but they cook goat cheese in the center of their hash browns.  And it's amaze-balls.I also had a decent bloody Mary, a (several) decent cup of coffee, and the interiors of this place are off-the-wall charming.  It really captures upscale diner perfectly, complete with breakfast bar."
"I met for a business lunch at the Little Goat this week.  What a great place!  I had the Tuna Melt and it was out of this world.  Open faced, and topped with fresh greens, this plate was not only tasty, but I didn't walk away feeling like I over ate.  And, yes I did eat the WHOLE THING!  A very bright and open concept environment, I will be back soon!"
Decent place for a Sunday brunch . Nothing exceptional but overall better than most of the brunch places around
"Let me preface this by saying that I heart Stephanie Izard immensely. I'd eat whatever she cooks; she can make a hard boiled egg and I'd enjoy it (although if there's anyone that can turn a hard boiled egg into something terrific it's her). The recent opening of the ""Little Goat"" provided another opportunity to enjoy her cooking; I was relieved today to have finally snagged a table at this place.I had noted in one of my earlier reviews that I had originally planned to visit a few months ago; I didn't anticipate waiting an hour and half to get a table. Would it have been worth the wait at the time? I'd have to try the rest of the menu to figure that out. Still, I feel like I may be playing a bit of favoritism by not saying anything bad about that fact.One dish jumped out at me when I looked at the menu: Fish Tostadas. I immediately ordered that and a side of fries. The dish itself was delicious; it wasn't ""off the wall"" amazing, but I saw a bunch of different ingredients in it that made the flavorof the dish interesting. There were a bunch of different vegetables and pieces of avocado in there; could not say what the dressing tasted like. The girl next to me ordered the old fashioned mac n cheese; I may have to look into ordering that the next time I visit.I was surprised at how fast the turnaround time was from when I ordered and when I started eating. Much like my first visit to the Girl & the Goat, Stephanie was there checking dishes and roaming the kitchen amongst the cooks. Everyone was pleasant there; from the host to the waitress Lizzie. Price-wise, it's very affordable with the quality of the food.As to be expected. I'm definitely coming back. Since this place is steps away from my office, it very well could be multiple visits."
Having the same thing. Just because ok?!
"the name says it all. expect diner food. service was on point, but it wasn't enough to make me a fan."
"This is a definite go-again for me. I had a very good patty melt - tender, juicy ground beef cooked perfectly medium to order and covered with melted cheese. I ordered the Kennebec home fries on the side. They were good but I actually wanted more potatoes and fewer bacon crumbs. Some of the potato pieces were too tiny to see. The service was excellent, the space bright and noisy. It's promoted as a diner, but it's a fairly slick, hipster place. The food is very good and that's what counts."
"Yum. The parathas burrito was so worth the wait (which, by the way was about 15 minutes shorter than the 75 minutes they estimated.  At noon. On at Saturday.  I know. I'm that committed to my brunch list.).   The space is bright and fun.  So much going on with the coffee bar, bar, bakery, diner - I'm sort of in love with the whole thing.  And, Sean (server) and James (manager) were both so gracious when I embarrassingly had to send my meal back.  Their customer service was first rate -- despite a line out the door, they recognize the importance of keeping each customer happy. As Tina Fey would (sort of, maybe?) say, I want to goat to there!Oh, and don't even get me started on the fig scone."
"Very interesting, well-prepared menu. Friendly, helpful staff. Sloppy Goat and Goat Chili didn't arrive as hot as I would have liked, but staff quickly and satisfactorily replaced my chili when I brought the issue to their attention (my dining partner was too intent on demolishing his Sloppy Goat sandwich to worry much about the temperature of it). Dining room is extremely loud: we were at a table for 2 and still had trouble hearing each other talk."
I went again this weekend and my friends and I all loved it! Elvis waffles were unbelievable and the bloody mary's really hit the spot. P.S. The site used to show the process of your wait time is great!
"Exceptional service and layout. This place has a great ambiance, and an even more impressive menu. The three or four page tome is full of so many different choices, there's no way to taste everything unless you order family style and have one bite of everything your table ordered.The salads are delicious, the sandwiches too. Loved the patty melt, will definitely be back."
"I've been super excited to get to the Little Goat and luckily for us, at 9pm on Saturday night we only had to wait a couple of minutes for 2 seats on the pass. The service was excellent and our waiter James was a delight. Rueben Sandwich: great corned beef which they make in house. But that great meat was buried in a sauerkraut/kimchi mixture which made the bread soggy and the sandwich hard to bite into. And the kimchi tasted like sour cabbage. All of the bite and sinus draining kick of true kimchi was missing. $12. 6/10.BBQ Pork Sandwich: dry bbq pork (which was tasty) with piles of slaw and a massive bun which again was too much and weighed down the best part of the sandwich. $12. 6/10.And since everything's a la carte, we had to order some sides. So we did...Smoked Fries: yummy fries! Definitely the highlight of the meal. Big enough to share. $5. 8/10.Mac & Cheese: what the hell?!?!? Totally underwhelming. Tasteless. Mushy pasta and flavorless white cheese sauce. I'm convinced white people don't know how to make mac & cheese. $7. 2/10.We saw some great looking dishes get put up on the pass. And the guys were awesome about telling us about the dishes we saw. I'd go back maybe and order some of those great looking dishes. But I don't have much hope for them. I'll give them a few more months before returning in the hopes that they find their footing..."
"YUMMMMMMMMMMM. Yes, I could sum this review up with that one word, but I wont! We went here last night and we each ordered something different to share. In order of my faves - I had the Fish Tostados, my friend had the Reuben and my other friend got the Goat Sloppy Joe. The fish was perfectly cooked and I liked the slaw on top. The rueben was perfectly salty and everything just worked so well together. The goat sloppy was good, just not my fave. We also shared an order of the french fries and those were OMG delicious. They smoke them before they fry them and you can really taste that smokiness. There is no question in my mind that I will be returning!"
"After an unfortunate ventilation issue at a neighboring restaurant left us sweet-less while celebrating a dear friend's milestone birthday, Little Goat came to our rescue!We showed up after 10pm and were promptly seated in a comfy booth.  We ordered several desserts to celebrate, and they were all divine.Server was delightful and made sure my friend had candles on his banana split.Love Little Goat and must go back to sample their savory dishes.*bleats with pleasure*"
"I've been here a few times now at different times a day, and it's definitely worth the long wait in line for the lively ambiance and quality of food. I love taking out of town guests here because 1. Famous top-chef association 2. Chicago-y and 3. The food is tasty with a twist...way better than standard American fare or Deep Dish.Have had morning cocktails and evening, and their goat's milk coffee. Love that there is a bar to hang out in during the longer wait times like brunch or weekend night dinner. I'd like to go back and order some of their fun breads and StumpTown coffee beans."
"NOTE, I went at 12 am on a Tuesday night so I only had to choose from a specific late night menu. The food was very delicious but I must say the two dishes we ordered were super fried and super buttery. Otherwise, good experience."
"Just a little disappointed from my first and most likely last Little Goat experience.   Waited about 1 hr 15 min for a table which actually wasn't that bad considering the place is new and everyone in Chicago is buzzing about Little Goat Diner right now.  After about 30 minutes of waiting for our food, I started to get just a little annoyed. Like where is our food? You have like easily 15 cooks back there.. what's wrong with this operation that you can't make a pork belly benedict and corned beef hash in a reasonable amount of time?  Doesn't the words quick service align with what a diner is supposed to be?Needless to say, the waitress was nowhere to be found during this time, didn't even apologize when our food came 45 minutes later and then had the gall to ask us to look at the dessert menu.   Also during our period of waiting one manager came up and said he really didn't know why the food was taking so long.  Ok well thanks a lot for that information that does absolutely nothing.   I think the only thing that redeemed the experience is that another manager handed our bill to us ran the card through and since none of her coworkers did anything about our awful waiting experience I decided to tell her how long everything took.  She was super apologetic about the whole thing and comped our bill.  But even after all that, I really don't have a desire to go back.  The food was just so-so so it's not like it was that good enough that it's going to justify another experience like that.  One time is enough."
Ah!! In love with this place despite how much I wanted to find something wrong with it. I just dropped in on my way to work at another restaurant in the area to grab some coffee and a bagel with schmear. The large mocha ran me about $4 but when I picked it up at the counter it had a heart in the foam. I ordered the Grump Goat bagel which has golden raisin and goat cheese. I asked the cashier to recommend a schemer and she recommended the green bean and cashew cream cheese. It was outstanding and not something I would have ordered for myself! The coffee was also perfect. I can't wait to come back and try the oatmeal and the sandwiches. They also sell a few items like a rosemary rub and several other apparel items like shirts and coffee mugs. I haven't tried the diner yet but I will be going there oh so soon. The staff is super friendly and helpful. Another winner from Izard and crew.
"Food:  Goat chili was excellent.  As was mac and cheese.  Note that even though the mac and cheese is a ""side,"" it is a huge portion.  Similarly, the sandwiches are HUGE.  Definitely had to take half home.  Like other reviewers, the goat sloppy joe was awesome.  The bbq pulled pork sammie was also fantastic.  The flavors were perfect.  And I normally am not a fan of pulled pork or shredded meat in general.  My only gripe is the size of the bun.  It might it a lot hard to eat because the bun was really really big.  Seriously worried my jaw was going to lock by trying to open it that wide.  Life is hard.   Drinks:  Beer selection was nice as was wine.  Blueberry bellini was interesting and different - in a good way.  Cappuccino was a fail.  A good one uses whole milk and they definitely had 2%.  Wah wah.   Service:  The bartenders were nice and friendly.  Our waitress was nice but kind of standoffish.  She never even asked us if we liked our food.      Ambience:  Causal, relaxed vibe.  Tons of different types of people.  Loud but not the annoying ""omg I can't hear what you are saying two feet away from me"" loud.  Other:  This place is super cute.  I loved the decor - clean lines, white, and cute - but not too many - decorations.  There doesn't seem to be a good time to come - at least on the weekends - because it always seems busy.  Maybe during the week might be a little slower.  Either way the way they seat you is pretty cool - via a texting system.  It is also nice that they have a spill over area for you to wait while you wait for a table.  Nice bar and coffee area."
"Curse this goat-themed place.  I wanted so hard not to like them because I had it in my head that they were some sort of pre-packaged Vegas-ready theme restaurant.Then I had a morning meeting and had the spiced apple pancakes.  I don't know or care what goes on around here later in the day or night.  I just want more of those pancakes.Please, little goat, forgive my reticence.  I love you now."
Little Goat Bread is fantastic. Some of the best coffee I've ever had (almond milk latte is SO smooth) and great bagels. I've tried most of the sweet breads and cookies (pb sandwich cookie is great!) and not been disappointed yet. Service is fast for how busy they are and on the weekdays (mid-morning) you can chat with the barista and cashier while you wait (Ann is a cashier and one of the nicest people I've ever encountered at a coffee shop).
Love girl and the goat so was excited to give this a try. Dinner: 3: buffalo sauce not very good in my opinion. Nothing tried great. Some pretty good. Good sidesBrunch 4: Elvis and the french toast were both fantastic.  Service was surprisingly poorBakery: 3
"Even with high expectations, Little Goat was still amazing.  We ordered the nachos, the Los Drowned, and the Patty Melt.First off, the Nachos were the absolute best I've ever had in my whole life.  The chips were made that day and were amazingly light and flaky.  The cheese sauce and BBQ pork were amazing.The party melt was so good, no grease but all the flavor.The Los Drowned though... It's a take on a French Dip - but I'm still thinking about it the next day.  It was like heaven between two slices of bread.  In fact I think they should rename it the Chicago Dip as, like its namesake, its in a class of its own."
"Went back this morning for the second time to try a few more things on the menu and I wasn't as wowed as I was the first time.  For starters, we were forced to sit at a communal table because we needed a high chair.  Last time it was no problem to sit at a booth with a high chair.  I hate communal seating...I know it's the new thing but I'm not a fan.  Especially if my kid is being a menace which happens from time to time. And then right after we were seated a guy was seated at a small table with a high chair....I had even asked to be seating at the exact same table he was and was told it was a fire hazard.  We shared a small order of the biscuits and gravy which were delish.  I had the elvis waffles...they weren't bad but they were just too much.  Too much of what?  I'm not sure...just too much.  I barely made a dent in them.  I think I would have liked them more if I could have put my own syrup on them.  My husband had the choc chip pancakes.  I wasn't a fan but I prefer milk choc to dark so that may be why.  Our waitress was fantastic and very friendly.  I need to go back for lunch or dinner next.  There's just too many things to try and not enough time!!!"
"Stephanie Izard's take on diner fare is top notch. Went for the first time on a Friday night around 8:30 p.m. and was able to get seated at the counter immediately. Sure, a table would have been nice, but it's a diner, so the counter's where it's at. Plus, you can watch the kitchen staff work their magic.Let's talk food first. I had a duck banh mi sandwich. Duck in two forms -- confit and duck liver mousse. Pickled veggies added a great crunch while not overpowering the flavor of the duck. Baguette was crisp on the outside and soft inside and held up nicely against the richness of the filling. Perhaps one of the best parts of this place is that breakfast is served all day. I didn't eat breakfast this time, but will definitely be back for things like the Fat Elvis Waffles and smoked corned beef hash. The prices were what surprised me the most. My date and I ate a great meal for under $50 (pre-tip), including beers and sides. My one quibble with this place? Everything on the menu sounded amazing. It took me longer than normal to decide because I wanted it all. Long story short: Just go. You won't be disappointed."
"how could i have forgotten this place!? twas so yum! in spite of a lengthy wait, we decided to tough it out. after all, we were a group of 4 couples and a group of 8 aint easy to seat. there was a lot of gossiping to be done anyways. they eventually called our name and we scrambled into our long booth and ordered... the whole menu. got the corned beef hash, the breakfast spaghetti, the french toast, the grits, and lots lots more! everything was YUM! coffee was simply meh, wish i had continued to free load off my friend and her free refills. at the end of the meal, nothing remained and we clambered into cabs, no longer little goats."
Gotta go five stars here... The brussel sprouts were amazing...mashed potatoes tempura..wow!  They make their own hot sauce!!  The Mac and Cheese were great after I added the hot sauce (before that...left a little something to be desired...).  Also best broccoli cheese soup I ever had!
"The first time I stepped into Little Goat I was throughly impressed with the atmosphere.  It's a modern day version of a diner with gourmet flavor ""diner foods""!Their attention to detail is amazing.  From the ""hidden door"" to the bathroom to the lighting fixtures and chairs, this diner had me at hello simply by its decor.I've been here twice so far. The first time was to simply pick up pastries from the Bakery.  The sour dough bread, scones and muffins were to die for! Talk about a savory breakfast packed into a pastry, you can taste each ingredient in the scone and it was baked to scone perfection!  The sour dough bread was crunchy on the outside and so moist on the inside, as a great sour dough should be!The second time I went was with my husband and some friends on a Saturday night.  The wait was estimated to be an hour long, normally I wouldn't wait this long but I was really excited to eat here.  We had a few drinks at the bar, which was crowded but we didn't have to wait long to get the bartenders attention and it made for a nice waiting area.  They texted us when our table was ready and we sat at a community table which was not as awkward as I thought it would be. We ordered: - Smoked Corn Beef Hash with Eggs (breakfast is served all day) = really good- Bulls Eye French Toast = very savory and sweet, but super flavorful- The Fat Club = not your average club sandwich, piled high with ingredients on their specialty bread- Horseshoe = huge portion, had to eat this with a fork and knife but it was good!Everything we ordered was pretty big in portion size and packed in a ton of flavor. The price point was pretty decent for the experience and flavors.  We all enjoyed our meals and needed a nap afterwards!"
Nothing like a business breakfast!I had the blueberry pancakes and they were out of this world! I also couldn't help myself since my coworker ordered the corned beef hash. I think I ate a quarter of his as well. I will be back!Little Goat Bread is also amazing. Their new tuna sandwich has cheezits on it and I love it.
"Without a doubt, one of the BEST lunches I have ever had. This is not purely about hype. These people know how to cook & prove that with every bite. Even my picky three-year-old loved it. I live in Michigan, but frequently visit Chicago. I will definitely visit every time I'm in town. Do NOT miss this place. Can't find parking? Valet it. You won't regret it."
"We had an hour long wait, but the pork belly pancake was yummy. My tummy is happy. The kimchi asian omelet was pretty good too. Try to go at a random time during the week for a shorter wait. Great food, fun atmosphere, good service, and good wait system (they text you when your table is ready, so you can go grab a drink somewhere or wander around. They have a website you can check to see how many people are ahead of you). I'll be back!"
"I'm breaking my non-Yelping streak for Little Goat, because it's just that fan-freaking-tastic. The coffee bar and bread shop are perfect for stopping in to pick up a cup of Stumptown coffee (hands down the best brew in the neighborhood now) or loaf of bread to go, and they also have an assortment of goodies to poke through, from locally made honey and soap to fresh flowers. If you're waiting for a table and you can edge in a spot at the bar, it's worth it. The diner itself is worth the wait (and I'm not just talking about the wait from when Stephanie Izard announced Little Goat until when it finally opened - I've been here twice, and waited 45 minutes once and an hour and fifteen the second time) and I love the text system that allows you to wander around or hit up another stop without risk of missing your seat. The space is fantastic, with comfy bar stools and kitschy Eames chairs that are reminiscent of a diner, but a sleeker look overall that makes the whole space feel a bit more indulgent. I'm a vegetarian, so I kind of expected not to be able to eat anything here, but the fried pickle goat cheese sandwich was amazing, as were the dark chocolate chip pancakes I had for brunch. I'm excited to try the veggie burger at some point as well. I hope they continue to add stellar and creative vegetarian options as the menu changes. Last but definitely not least, the cocktails are worth your while and stellar local brews are on tap."
"This review is for Little Goat Bread, which probably should have its own entry.Pros:- Staffed at a very high level- Staff is friendly and enthusiastic- Every savory item I tried was delicious- Utterly fantastic beverage listCons:- Cinnamon bun was too dry - Expensive for what you get- Uncomfortably cramped layout- SLOW carryout serviceThis would be a great place to sit, drink, and snack.  Unfortunately, there are no tables, there are relatively few seats at the counter, and the space doubles as a waiting area for LG next door.  There only were maybe 30 customers in there when I arrived, yet every seat was taken and the rest of the folks were struggling to find a polite place to stand.  This issue arises only because the space is surprisingly narrow.  I can't imagine how uncomfortable it must be when it's actually crowded.Let me walk you through it.  The carryout counter is all the way in the back.  You can't see it when you walk in and need to be directed through the people standing around with no place to go.  Then you have to walk through them again on the way out.  When you get back there, there is no clear line, so it's hard to tell who already has ordered.  I quickly learned that none of the customers milling around back there were waiting to order, but rather all were waiting for their food which, in retrospect, should have been taken as a warning sign.  There is room for maybe 2 or 3 people to stand abreast between the carryout counter and the bar, which is a problem because, as noted, the place is heavily staffed, and there is a steady flow of workers heading through that area, some carrying trays.  This leaves you with a choice of (1) standing close to the carry out counter, which gives new-comers the impression that you have not yet ordered and blocks their view of the products and prices; (2) standing close to the bar, which comes uncomfortably close to invading the personal space of the lucky people who nabbed a place to sit; or (3) playing Frogger, jumping out of the way of every passing employee or customer.  Just a terrible layout.Of course this all would have been much less of an issue if i didn't have to wait 15 minutes for my sandwich.  That's inexcusable considering the staffing level, the lack of customers, the simplicity of the dish, and the fact that this is essentially a fast-food counter.  When I finally received my sandwich, it was delicious but contained about 2 oz. of meat, which is kinda sad when they're charging $8 to $10 each with no sides.I realize that most of my complaints would be ridiculous if I had gone at a peak time with 100 customers in there, but that simply was not the case.  In sum, this is a great place to sit and drink and snack, assuming you can find a place to sit.  The impressive selection of craft beer, cider, and regional soda alone makes such a visit worthwhile.  If you want a complete meal, stick to LG next door, which presumably has the same beverage selection."
"Probably would have given this place 5 stars, but went to the Girl and the Goat the night before, and that meal literally blew my mind.  Monday 12:00PMWait time: 30 minutesAmbiance: DinerService: He was okay. Had a seafood and nut allergy in the group, server didn't seem to excited about that, wasnt entirely sure about what had nuts what didnt.Food:French Toast with Fried Chicken: Nom Nom Nom. Good.  Quite filling, and quite sweet. Recommend splitting a savory breakfast dish with one your companions.Brandade thing: Delicious.  PLay on eggs benedict.  Pancake thing: Equally as delicious. The lightest of all three dishes our group tried.Chili Cheese Fries:  Fries arent anything to tell mom about.  But the chili was quite delicious.Izzard knows whats up."
"I've been avoiding Little Goat when I heard about the exorbitant wait times, despite being a huge fan of Stephanie on Top Chef. Well, apparently, the trick is to eat alone. Got seated at the bar immediately on Saturday around noon. Took me a while to decide on what to get, so I asked the waitress, and without hesitation she said: French toast. Ok, bring it on! It was definitely unlike any French toast I've ever had: succulent pieces of fried white meat chicken (which I usually steer clear of because they're often overcooked, not here though), sweet and savory syrup and butter-grilled bread. I'm definitely coming back for some of the more adventurous options on the menu. One thing though: try to grab a seat on the left side of the bar. I was seated on the right side, directly in front of the heat lamps. Felt like I was about to have a heat stroke after the meal. Other than that, nothing to complain about!"
"Well-what can I say: Stephanie Izard did it again. Fantastic!! The atmosphere is calming and welcoming, the food is SUPER flavorful and well seasoned (sexy plating), the staff is fun and friendly, prices are very reasonable, and the drinks are killer. Yes-it's busy and a long wait but the text/website showing your place in line makes it a smoother and the bar/bakery/coffee/souvenir area helps to kill time. I also love going to a place for lunch and leaving thinking, ""man, I gotta come back and try more"". Cheers! We WILL be back. Stephanie ROCKS! See for yourself."
"Went here yesterday after a fun day with the bestie at the Randolph Street Market a few blocks away! I had a hard time deciding what to get because everything looked so freakin amazing! I finally opted for the blue plate special of the day: Beef Heart Gyros served on top of white wine marinated eggplant (house-made marinade is sold in the store next door), which is topped on a layer of homemade hummus, which is layered on top of homemade fluffy naan (baked fresh in the BAKERY next door), which is all layered with guess what, HOMEMADE tzatziki sauce, fresh cucumber and tomato slices on top. FREAKIN amazing. The bestie had the goat burger - with all the usual toppings of lettuce, cheese, tomatoes - she said it was one the most delicious burgers shes had. Couple sitting across from us were oozing out their mouths at the sundae they ordered, like a true diner scene (we sat at their communal table).Girls next to us enjoyed a breakfast item (served all day) which was french toast topped with a barbeque maple syrup and fried chicken strips, and covered in gooseberries!Everything looked too good to be true. I need to go back and try the whole menu. They had an entire section for sides and an entire section for taters. I mean, come on. This woman thought of everything!!The service was fantastic - our waiter was both really helpful, knowledgeable, and friendly. And timely :) Ambiance was comfortable, like a diner fresh in the 50s, without having time to get worn and torn yet!Oh little goat, you have my heart."
"A delicious place to eat, fun atmosphere, and easy to get to by public transportation.On a visit to Chi-town, my friend and I were looking for a good place to get breakfast and Little Goat was recommended by a friend. I had the Elvis Waffles - HIGHLY recommend. The waffles are fluffy and delightful, just like a waffle should be. But the kicker is the peanut butter butter, the syrup with bits of real bacon in it, and the bananas cut up on top. I couldn't eat the whole thing (the servings are generous!) but I sure wanted to. My friend had the french toast, and it was equally amazing. It came with fried chicken. I tried a few bites. The chef clearly cares about making each component of the meal as delicious as possible. A lot of care went into these entrees, and it shows! Also noteworthy, there's a bread shop behind the restaurant that sells sandwiches, pastries, and coffee. Service is outstanding. Our waitress was friendly, but not in that overselling it kind of way. She just seemed genuinely happy to be there. Big star for that."
"This was our second time trying Little Goat - first time wasn't amazing and we wanted to give it another try.  We thought the first time maybe we ordered the wrong thing so were more adventurous in our ordering.  I had the fish tostadas which were a ""4"" and my husband had a goat burger which wasn't anything special for $14, especially when you have to order the fries alacarte.  The service was not good, after taking our order our server disappeared - the food runners interacted with us more than he did and then it took 20 min to get our check after our plates were cleared - unacceptable.  He was probably disappointed with the tip, but he wasn't good.  Tried it twice, unfortunately won't be back :("
"Great bar  and drinks, but that's where my enthrallment with Little Goat ends. The food was not nearly as good as the hype, seating was uncomfortable, and it's all more expensive than it should be. The waiter made a huge deal about their fried chicken, which was meh at best.This is the fourth celebrity chefs restaurant I've gone to and been sadly disappointed. Im starting to think those are the ones to avoid with all your might. Au Cheval, just  down the street, is soooooo delicious but no big name. Hmmmmmm"
"This review is only in regards to the bar as I did not eat here. However, I ordered the cocktail Hoopoe's hope and it was delicous. It was so freshing and tasted of peaches and lemon. I had 2 in fact. I am really picky about drinks but this drink was a winner. However, my husband had an old fashioned and he thought it was kind of meh. He likes the ones at Bavette's better. Anyways, we will have to come back to try the food, but I really liked the layout of the space."
"The food was pretty good. As the waitress mentioned this was an ""elevated diner menu."" I was expecting to be blown away, but if I'm being honest with myself, I was not. Our dinner:-Sweet Onion Soup: Very good. Probably the highlight of dinner-Cheesy Garlic Bread: Good. The bread was really the highlight and ours was a little too...brown. Whatever it came with on the side was good, though.-Horseshoe: eh. It's a burger, chili, cheese sauce and fries (much like a famous Springfield dish). The smoked fries had a weird flavor and the burger had too much seasoning. The seasoned burger, seasoned chili, and presumably seasoned cheese sauce just made for too much seasoning in this entree.-Chicken Cordon Bleu: The bread on this was weird with the breaded chicken and the rest of the sandwich. Woud not order this again.-Vanilla Shake: Delicious. In all, it was an OK meal. Definitely not amazing for the price.  I'm willing to give it another chance once they work out the kinks. Also, there are other things on the menu that sounded good (especially the breakfast)."
"Little Goat is one of those straws that will eventually help break the camels back of celebrity chef corporate eateries. I was fine with the wait and the waiting area (my favorite part of the restaurant) although there seemed to be stunted communication between those controlling the constant flow of diners. The room has an airy feel with a sea of people amongst more than a few clashing materials. The room is begging for a focal point; some art, perhaps a chandelier suspended from the skylights. The booths bear a strong resemblance to coach seating - no legroom. As is per usual, tall people bear the brunt of this economizing. Loved the hidden door to the restrooms although i saw a couple of people who didn't get the joke.The cacophony, resulting from a total lack of sound absorbing materials, is typical hip-eatery. There is an art and science to creating an atmosphere of sound and neither is in practice here. It's a crudely wrought design.I had the beef ravioli and while I am a big fan of abstract thinking, this did not work. More of a hash with hard bits of ground beef and very little of the tangy tomato sauce. The pasta didn't serve as a vessel for the beef, a hallmark of ravioli design.The staff was ultra friendly but ultimately they were no competition for the rest of the experience. Overall I think we're at a point where the branding has reached a sort of witty perfection but the place has no soul."
"I wasn't even hungry but figured I had to squeeze in one more good meal in Chicago before I go back to LA.  I had Girl & The Goat the previous day so was dying to try the Little Goat.I got a tiny bit stressed out because I couldn't decide what to order!  You know a restaurant is good when there's too many things you want to try and the server says they're all good and stresses out with you.After finally making a game time decision, I ended up with Los Drowned- braised beef, avocado, cheese, pickled peppers n onions, spicy mayo on a hoagie.Amazing.Love the vintage diner look & feel.  Must come back...!"
"I really wanted to love this place and there were things that I did love about it but there were also things that prevented me from giving it 4 or 5 stars. Likes: Got a table pretty quickly early Thursday evening, great and friendly service(one of the bakers gave my girlfriend a free bagel while she waited for me at the bar), some of the food was great(Pork Belly Pancake was the best thing I tried), and it was cool to have a view of Stefanie working on the line for a bit. Dislikes: The Duck Confit Banh Mi while very tasty didn't deliver. The baguette was a bit tough and the filling wasn't moist enough to counter that. Also at $13 it, along with most of the food I tried, is overpriced. The smoked fries were ok but they were way over-seasoned. Also, for a place that's open until 2am they need to step their beer game up. They have a few decent beers on tap but it's mostly the same 2 Hearted/3 Floyds stuff you see everywhere else. Overall: It's a really nice place, with great service, and tasty food. However, being a new place it's got some kinks it needs to work out. I think I I'll wait a while before I go back."
"choco taco... whaaaaa???  It's a sundae.  Off to a good start.  Made from sour cream ice cream???  Sounds disgusting, but really - just try it.  Tortilla chips and errythanggg...  Brilliance.  Why oh why does this place have to be alllll the way in the West Loop...  And when is the next time I'm going to be able to haulllll ass all the way over there."
"I'm really wishing there was a 3.5 star rating. I am a huge brunch fan, but this was nothing out of the ordinary. The best thing here was the french fries because they were smoked. We are huge fans of girl and the goat, so we decided to wait an hour at 3pm for a table... we thought by coming at an odd time we wouldn't have to wait as long... but we did. So I got a bloddy and an Irish coffee at the bar while we were waiting... the Irish coffee was actually delicious. The food was slightly disapointing, neither my fiance nor I liked what we got (except for the fries, which don't come with the food, you gotta order them sep). So honestly, Hub 51 had better brunch... and not even to talk about yolk or nookies, where for about $12/person you leave full of delicous food that won't dissapoint your pallet."
"Where to start....I went with 3 other friends.  I gave the hostess my phone number so she could text us when our table was ready  Mind you it wasn't crowded at all.  I was standing 5 feet away from the hostess, and instead of walking two steps to let us know our table was almost ready,  she sends me a text at which point I walk to her and she tells me our table will be ready soon.  We ended up waiting another 3 minutes.  Really?  You can't take the 2 steps to let me know when we're ready to be seated?Sat down to eat.  Waiter came by after a few minutes and asked if we were ready to order.  We ordered drinks and told him we needed a couple minutes to figure out our food.  Afterwards, the drinks: 2 orange juices and 1 beer took 15 minutes to arrive and our waiter still hasn't come by to take our dinner order.As we were getting our drinks, another helpstaff came by to fill our water.  He somehow switched my glass with my friends in the time it took to pour our waters.  We told him this and he simply said ""Ok, let me switch them.""  No apology.  When the waiter finally came by after a full 30 minutes after we sat down, I joked, ""We thought you forgot about us.""  Instead of simply apologizing, he blamed the bartender for being slow with drinks for other tables.  Real classy dude, throwing your coworker under the bus.We finally placed our order.  My gf and I ordered the cheesy garlic bread ($5), Boo Boo Baise ($18) (a seafood soup), and the fried chicken ($22).Garlic bread took about 15 mins to arrive.  By this point, I was starving.  The garlic bread was so greasy and soggy that I almost decided to not eat it.  I padded down each piece with napkins and even then, it was still soggy.  Just to see how greasy they were, I took 5 napkins and stacked them top of a piece.  I started to see the oil through the 5th napkin and it was all the way through the 4th.  Our entrees arrived about 30 mins after we placed the order (1 hour from the time we sat down).  The one good thing: they were still hot thankfully.  However, that's the only positive aspect of the entree.  - Boo Boo Baise: I can't really comment, but my gf and I couldn't eat this due to the strong fish odor/taste coming from the dish.  This may just have just been the mussels, but if it's your first time eating mussels, this is not the dish to experiment with.- Fried Chicken: Huge disappointment.  Again, slightly greasy although not as greasy as the bread.  However, what really bothered me was the chicken was lacking any meat.  For $22, I expect there to be a reasonable amount of chicken.  However, they literally give you half of a small chicken, so it's about 5 pieces of varying type, but mostly just bone.  The chicken skins fell off in the gravy or while trying to handle the chicken.  Overall Service: HORRIBLE.  Our party was very hungry for a long time, and Little Goat dropped the ball.  I can't believe how incompetent and rude our waiter was. When I told him I was disappointed with the chicken, he tells me half-jokingly, ""You're a chicken snob.  I'm like that too.""  Little Goat needs to retrain this guy in what's appropriate and not appropriate to say to an upset customer.  Also, do you understand how insulting it is to offer my party pens and magnets (which you guys use for advertising) as an apology for the bad service and meal?Overall Food: Just bad.  Disappointing for the lack of quality at high prices for a diner and overall let down especially given all the positive Yelp reviews.  The $3 glass of OJ was just slightly larger than a double shot cup.  Really guys?My standards aren't very high, but I know when fried chicken sucks and when it doesn't.  To Little Goat: If you want an example of high quality fried chicken for less than what you guys charge, look at Fried Chicken at Joe's Stone Crab for $20.OVERALL: By the end of the meal, I just wanted to leave and never have to deal with that waiter again or the hugely disappointing food."
"We happened upon this place while in town for the weekend and didn't get out to dinner until almost 10pm, so we got a table rather quickly .  It was still packed at that time of night but the service was impeccable and our waitress was clearly a fan of the food.  The BF had the Sloppy Club and I had the Goat Cheese Fries.  Both were amaze-a-balls!  Super YUM!!  We finished with a milkshake and a smile.  It was so so so good.We were really excited to go back and get some coffee later in the weekend, but unfortunately, the coffee was only so-so.  I thought the drip coffee was good, but the BF got a espresso that was sour.  Otherwise this would be a 5 star, hands down, check this out."
"YAY, how exciting that this place is open!  My bf and friend went today for lunch and arrived at 12:25pm.  The line was so long to order, but all of the staff was very sweet and helpful, asking us if we wanted to order a coffee and if we had any questions on the menu.  The menu consists of basically a few sandwich options (shrimp, turkey, beef, egg salad, make your own), bagels, oatmeal, and a salad.  The price points are very reasonable.  I got the shrimp sandwich ($10) and a couple chocolate croissants for coworkers ($4) and goat chili ($6 for small which I split).  We watched the sandwiches being made because there is a viewing area in the back after you order.  Stephanie herself was there wrapping up sandwiches.  I'm so glad we were able to watch because it turned out there was this thick white stuff going on the shrimp sandwiches that wasn't listed as an ingredient.  I got worried it was cream cheese because it came out of a tub labeled ""CC spread."" I asked a staff person what that was because I hadn't seen any dairy listed as an ingredient.  The staff person said it was the ""spicy mayo, no dairy"" but then Stephanie (bless her) piped up and said ""no that's cream cheese"" and then offered to make it without that cream cheese.  Not sure if that was like spicy-cream-cheese-mayo or if they just ran out of the spicy mayo that was listed on the menu, but appreciate Stephanie's attentiveness.  Finally, after 25 minutes of waiting, we were out with our sandwiches!The shrimp sandwich is pretty awesome.  I like to think of it as a shrimp taco on a super tasty potato bun.  It's got a fried tortilla the size of the bun, avocado, pickles, pickled slaw, and a shrimp salad.  I think the bun is a little too much and it may be better if there was actually less bread so the ratio of filling to bread was a little more even.  But even so, it was lovely. The goat chili was delish but heavy because they are pretty generous with amount of meat.  It would be nice if they had a chili and bread option.  I think $6 is a little high for the small portion you get, but I'm unfamiliar with how much goat is.  My coworker really liked the chocolate croissant.  I thought it was a little expensive at $4 (compared to the high-value sandwiches) but she thought the flaky-to-chewy-to-chocolate ratio was perfect, so I guess it's worth it?All in all I think Little Goat has a lot of promise.  The staff, if they stay this nice in the long term, are really great.  I think they know it's a little insane to wait 25 minutes for a sandwich to-go and they appreciate that people do.  Hopefully the kitchen will get a little more streamlined and the sandwiches will come out faster.  Looking forward to trying other sandwiches there in the new year!"
"I am as a big of a Stephanie Izard fan as the next yuppie foodie in Chicago, but unfortunately Little Goat did not live up to the expectations.The place is really cool, very classy dineresque and although it was packed at 4pm on a Saturday, we were seated immediately at the bar where we could see the kitchen.  Our waiter seemed to want to be anywhere but at work which was unfortunate for us and also for the girl sitting next to us who's water glass he totally overflowed and sauntered away.We ordered the Fried Pickle, the Patty Melt with a veggie burger, and the smoked fries.  The fries were DELICIOUS.  Crispy, with a hint of smoke and a generous portion for sharing.  These came out first and the line manager asked if we wanted them before our food, we were hungry and the food wasn't super quick so we used them as an appetizer.  Both sandwiches had good flavors and tasted good but just sort of missed the mark.  The bread on the Fried Pickle was soggy and the veggie patty on the Patty Melt was crumbling and luke warm at best.The coffee was up there with the fries as the best thing we ate or drank so shout out to Stumptown for that.  The bill ran about $30 which wasn't too bad but I would say sit at the bar in Little Goat Bread and enjoy a cocktail and the ambiance...maybe wait until Little Goat has their kinks figured out."
"I have been here twice and both times I left disappointed.  I love The Girl and the Goat so naturally I really wanted to love Little Goat.  Im still holding out hope that maybe I just ordered the wrong items.  I had the veggie pasta the first time- it wasnt terrible but it wasn't worth taking home the leftovers either.  On the second visit, I had the fried pickle appetizer and the shrimp salad- which was more like shrimp with cole slaw.  I really want this place to be good.   Im hoping they turn the food around.  The atmosphere is great and the staff was very friendly.  I just hope the food improves."
"Like its larger, fancier parent, Little Goat has a very hip feel, friendly folks, and close-knit seating arrangements. We went on a Sunday at prime brunch time (around 11:30 a.m.) and only had to wait about a half hour -- they have seating on the bar/pastry/coffee side and text you when your table (or two seats on the end of a larger table, as it turned out) is ready, which is nice and hassle-free. The menu employs unique preparations and interesting ingredients and the waitress (Raquel) was friendly and helpful. Cute hipster-y waitstaff uniforms. But the food?  Wasn't amazing. The smoked fries were an unusual but savory and good starter but the shrimp and grits lacked in hearty flavor what they contained in creativity.  I've had better at more than one Chicago brunch spot.  And like Girl and the Goat, I felt very rushed.  I'd taken three bites of my dish and was literally holding the fork in my hand when asked if I needed it ""taken out of my way."" I realize y'all are busy, but can I enjoy my breakfast for at least 10 minutes before being hustled along.  The prices were fair but toward the upper end of the Chicago brunches I've had of late.  I was glad to try it but won't be hurrying back."
"My boyfriend and I stopped here before a Blackhawk's game and loved it! I honestly can't remember what beers we had, but we were satisfied. After those we had the pork nachos... game over, so good. The Pork Nachos are a MUST have if you come here (how could you not want to try them?) After those we tried the Los Drowned Sandwich, and that was just as delicious. Try either of these choices and you'll be happy! We also noticed a lot of people in the restaurant eating breakfast and it looked just as good, will definitely be back to try it! The only thing holding me back from the 5th star was we were stuck at a ""communal"" table which wasn't bad until a family with two small kids showed. I just think they are kind of a waste of space. Regardless, I'd definitely check this place out!"
"I am a huge fan of this restaurant. The diner is spacious, bright, and with good design, but most importantly, the food is delicious. Some specifics:Grilled Cheese - the best I've ever had. Gouda is sharp, bacon and roasted tomatoes complement it perfectly. I think they even sneak a bit of bok choi on there, which is interesting. It's a huge sandwich though, so exercise caution as it's pretty rich.Nachos - again, the best I've ever had. Tortillas are nicely fried, and the pork, beans, and cheese on top make it very tasty. This is another huge dish.Sloppy Goat - pretty good, but nothing too special.Tuna Melt - a very good open-faced tuna melt with an especially delicious cheese sauce. A lighter-tasting item on the menu, which is welcome given that most items on the menu are pretty heavy.Pork Belly Pancake - pretty good. Heavy on asian ingredients (such as hoisin, bok choy), making it pretty different from the rest of the menu. Shepherd's Pie - no longer on current menu. Meat base consisted of goat, beef, and pork. Decent, very filling, though ultimately not very interesting.Pork Baked Beans - competes for the best I've had. I'm a huge fan of good baked beans, and these are nice and tangy and the pork taste really comes across (bacon and drippings from the pig face dish at sister restaurant Girl and the Goat). Other - good list of draft beer offerings (about a dozen to choose from). Friendly, attentive service. The website is very cool.The menu is huge, so there is bound to be some items that are pretty good as opposed to great. However, there are plenty of great items to be found on this menu, and I think there are no other drawbacks. An easy 5 stars."
"My boyfriend and I stopped in on Friday around 5:40 p.m. and were seated right away. We've tried to get a table on a few other occasions, but the wait has always been long. Seems we found the right time to go! There were a few open tables when we arrived. But before long, it was totally crowded. We really loaded up on food. We ordered: 1) Modus Operandi beer from Ska Brewing;2) The Mitten cider from Virtue;3) Fried Pickles & Onion Rings: Bread & Butter pickles, ranch, curry mayo; 4) Reuben: Smoked corned beef, kimchi, kraut, cheese, special sauce, pretzel rye;5) Los Drowned: Braised beef, avocado, buttercase cheese, pickles, spicy mayo, hoagie; and 6) Choco Taco Sundae: Ingredients aren't on the menu, but I believe it featured gelato from Black Dog Gelato (sour cream gelato, caramel, chocolate, whipped cream). I ordered The Mitten bourbon barrel aged cider, and I thought it was delicious! I would have loved to order three more. All the food was great. I loveee me a Reuben sandwich, and this one was fantastic. I wouldn't have minded a bit more of the special sauce though. I don't think we'd order the Choco Taco Sundae again. We were already quite full from the rest of the food, and we didn't particularly love the sour cream gelato. It was good but not great. Our waiter was not too pesky, and when my boyfriend started wiping down the table, a busboy saw and came to clean the table for us. Very observant! I'd give it a 4.5."
Cute place- great food (we split the Elvis waffles) - the staff knew we were in a hurry and they helped us out.  Would definitely return.
"If I have to wait 50 minutes to be seated, the food better be amazing and breakfast at LG simply isn't.The breakfast side of the menu keeps with the tired trend of all-pork everything. Only 1 of the savory breakfast dishes omits pork, while most of the sweet dishes include it. Yawn. Service wasn't great. Despite telling the hostess we needed a high chair, we were initially seated at a booth that could not accommodate a high chair (which lead to more waiting as they concurrently seated a party without kids at a high chair friendly table). I asked our server about the uniquely-titled ""kimchee & bacon & eggs & pancakes Asian style breakfast tasty thing."" She said that it was kimchee and eggs without further explanation. When asked if the dish included pancakes per the title, she said she wasn't sure, but then said she thought so. I asked if I could sub out the bacon and she said she didn't know without an offer to investigate. I ended up with an Indian-themed breakfast burrito which was generally good, although it included a bean salad that wasn't complementary or interesting.On separate visits, I picked up coffee and baked goods to go. The coffee here is quite good and highly recommended, although I wouldn't recommend LG over the nearby Colombe. The baked items have been hit or miss: good cookies, excellent muffins, dry bread.I didn't dislike LG enough to write it off, so I'd be willing to try it for lunch or dinner to see if my opinion changes (although I wouldn't wait more then 5 minutes to get in). I wonder what the reviews would look like if people were honest with themselves and not blinded by the high-trend factor..."
"I've been to Little Goat a few times, finally found some time to write up a little review.I'm obsessed with the ""The Little Goat"" from the coffee bar! It's a yummy espresso drink made with goat's milk. It's very rich and topped with whipped cream and caramel so I usually share it :)The first time I tried the Fried Chicken for dinner I thought it was really good. Just wish they had served the coleslaw separately because it's cold and tasted a little funny when it mixed with the warm gravy and mashed potatoes. The second time I had it (yes I had it twice) I thought it was a little too salty, which is a lot coming from me because I LOVE salty food! I'm also a huge corned beef hash fan but from Little Goat I wasn't really impressed. Maybe the server hyped it up too much for me? I like my corned beef hash and hash browns really nice and crispy... flavor was good but the meat was too soft for my taste and the hash browns were a little too greasy for me (also has cheese mixed in which I don't usually opt for).I recently had the fish tostadas and thought they were great! Would go back for that again, and also to try a few more things on the menu.As of right now I have mixed emotions about the place. I like it overall but need to go a few more times to try more things before I make up my mind. For now, 3 stars :P"
"Stopped in this morning on my way home from the hospital (too excited), even though 11am is a bit early for lunch!Little Goat Bread opened this morning at 6am for sandwiches, pre-made salads, soups, breads/pastries, and drinks. There is a large and friendly opening team working to make sure things are running smoothly, which they are! I was told the Diner will open in a few weeks. Anyway, I asked for a sandwich rec at the counter, and was recommended The Shrimp because ""it changed my life."" I ordered the sandwich and a hot chocolate to go and was planning to wait until actual lunchtime to eat, but the sandwich just looked too good. However, it will hold up for awhile if you need to transport your lunch! I was in and out of the shop in about 10 minutes, and I took my time.Sandwich was soft, creamy, and delicious, with the easy crunch of the masa chip, tasty avocado, and great shrimp salad. It's a perfect sandwich, go get one. The hot chocolate was not very chocolatey, and I wouldn't recommend it. But I really didn't mind that minor disappointment after eating my sandwich.Overall, impressive place to grab lunch and a coffee. I am excited to try their pastries next time!"
"I have debated on if I should write this review or not.  I am a big Stephanie Izard fan and a Girl and the Goat Fan.  I was so excited to see her open another restaurant in my neighborhood!  I have been to Little Goat Bread at least a half dozen times and love it.  Everything I have had has been outstanding.  Solid 4 stars there!  But the diner.... for right now, I cannot give it 4 stars but I am hoping it will earn a rewrite soon. Our Sunday Brunch at 11:15 am had a 2 hour wait.  I was coming with some friends from the suburbs and we had other things to do while we waiting or I would have never even gone.  I do not wait 2 hours for a diner.  Or anywhere else for that matter.  The wait ended up being close to 1.5 hours, I guess that is better than 2 hours, but certainly not a short wait. The glasses and appetizer plates had more than spots on them.  I think they need to check their dishwasher because there was crud on all of the serve ware we had.  This screams dirty diner, not expensive upscale diner.  The food...I ordered a cup of tomato apple soup and was brought chicken bacon.  Once I tried it and realized it was smoky bacon in there and not tomato I had to track our server down to let her know.  Her excuse for this was that the runners see red (since both soups are red) and just grab one.  It happens.  Thankfully I am not a vegetarian, but I have a big problem with this.  Who is expediting?  Why would a runner not check to make sure they have the correct order?   Hopefully this is something that more training will work out?  The soup itself was pretty good.  Not WOW, but good.  I would get the goat chili every time though, it is fabulous.  Per my waitresses recommendation, I got the Los Drowned sandwich.  I was looking at the Reuben and she told me that I shouldn't get it that its just a Reuben, that the Los Drowned was like a way better version of an Italian Beef.  This was not the case.  Reading the description it sounded great, but sadly my meal did not resemble anything that was described.  It looked like it had been thrown out then placed back on my place.  It was beyond Soggy, you couldn't even pick it up.  The juice from it was just swimming all over the plate.  There was extra au jus for dipping, but I couldn't image as it already seemed as though it was dipped.  I expected some kick or at least some really good braised beef inside.  Bland, no flavor.  I would order this from a fast food joint for half the price before I would order from here again.  I noticed after I read descriptions online that it should have had avocado, mine had none.  Once our sever came back around I let her know that she was totally off the mark on that recommendation.  She did offer to get me something else and I took her up on it.   The waitress proceeded to tell me she only had it twice, once prepared by the chef and it was bland and greasy, then once when Stephanie was on the line and it was great so she had thought it improved.  Stephanie was there that day, but did not see her on the line.  However, her cooks have to be able to carry out her vision and recipe consistently for this to work.  Chicken Cordon Bleu Sandwich- My friend ordered this and it looked good, so this became my replacement order. This was great, I would definitely get this again.  Full of flavor, everything went very well together.  I wished I had ordered this from the beginning.  Smoked Fries: These were just ok for me.  They had a good amount of seasoning on, but I don't think they really did it for me.  It was kind of like a bbq french fry.  I didn't dislike them, but I probably wouldn't feel the need to ever order them again. Additional items: my other friend had the Elvis Waffles and I had a bite, they were really good.  If I were in the mood for breakfast, this would definitely be on my list of things to get.  I am hoping that with time most of the quirks will be worked out and consistency of the food will improve.  For now, I will go with my 3 star review.  We will be back to try dinner when there is no wait and maybe the score will improve.  While the diner is working on getting up to par, I will certainly continue to go to LG Bread in the mean time!  I already miss the upstairs dining option but hope that some classes or dinners are coming soon!"
"A scene from last night's dinnerWaiter (after seeing that I had a GF menu): How sensitive to gluten are you on a scale of preference to Celiac?Me: Anaphylaxis.Waiter: Ok, we can handle that. Make sure you stay away from the items that are starred on the menu. They either contain soy sauce or are fried in a shared frier. Also, we clean all the knives and utensils used for your food before we start cooking. Also, the fries are made in their own frier, but it is next to the regular frier so while we try to keep them separate, it is up to you if you are comfortable eating them.Fastforward 20 minutes:Waiter: I know you have been waiting a while, and your food will be up shortly, but we were taking extra care with your meal.When they brought the food, I asked for an unopened ketchup bottle (because you know people put there knife in there and crumbs can contaminate the ketchup). When they didn't have any, the waiter went and got some out of a large pump bottle that know knives ever enter. If you are gluten-free and in Chicago, you really need to go to Little Goat because they totally get it. They knew just how serious celiac & severe food allergies are. Plus, they cooked my gluten-free meal perfectly. Oh, and the food is superb."
"I'm finally apart of the In Crowd. After three failed attempts to come here and an hour long wait, I was able to savor the flavor of Little Goat. The atmosphere was very cool, but also laid back. Snagged a booth for my troubles which I think is one of the better sears to have here.  Service was prompt and attentive. Awesome that breakfast, lunch, and dinner are served all day long.  Ordered the cinnamon bun to start, excellent. Next, one fat club and a patty melt with the onion rings and fried pickles, excellenter. I look forward to trying this place again on a less crowded day, if that even exists."
just. plain. awesome.my man isn't quite the foodie i am (yet) - so this was the perfect place for us.  foodie brain power in casual environment.  pretty much the yummiest diner i've ever been to in my entire life.  we shared a delcious chocolate malt milkshake - he got a burger... i got a GOAT burger with kimchi on it.  just great.  and the service was SPOT. ON.  (and i'm picky).  well done!!
"I think we've all come to accept that anything Stephanie Izard does will be creative and perfect, and Little Goat is no exception.  The menu is overwhelming, not only because of the number of items on it, but because everything sounds (and is) just so. damn. good.  Even though this place is super casual ""diner"", it's a great late night spot with great cocktails. Highly recommend the gin and cucumber one.  The crowd is lively, the service is excellent, and the food... OH, the food! Breakfast all day, Ms. Izard style? Well, that's surely worth 5 stars."
"I went here twice within a few weeks and needless to say both times were superb. The service is friendly, courteous, and knowledgable. The food is amazing and reasonably priced. The reason I had to go back was because I'm addicted to their cheesy crab dip and their gluten free pineapple muffin. They're both SO good!The group I was with also ordered the ruben, chicken cordon blue, spiced apple pancakes, and tomato apple soup. The pancakes were huge, and warmed up great for breakfast the next morning. We definitely love the Little Goat."
"They had me at peanut butter ""butter"" and bacon.  I drank Local Option's  ""Blood ov the Kings"" and ate the Fat Elvis waffles for dinner and while I had to spend the next 3 days fasting to fit into my suit again, it was well worth it.  It's a casual diner with high quality food and drinks.  If you want a great meal off a menu with a good number of options without spending a ton, I highly recommend the Little Goat."
"""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" Little Goat was great, in all facets! The food was delicious. Everyone at my table got a burger, but of different variety: A Patty Melt w/ a Goat Patty, The All American with Beef Patty, and The Korean with Goat Patty. Everyone raved about their burger. For sides we tried the french fries and Mac 'n Cheese (made with White Cheddar), and enjoyed them both. As a note, you only need about 1 side for every 2 people.They have a full bar, good beer and wine selection, and shout out to the DJ or whoever picked the great music playlist!Last but not least, there is most likely going to be a long-ish wait for a table (no reservations accepted). However, they have a really efficient system where they text you when your table is ready. It also gives you a personalized webpage where you can periodically check the status of your wait. We had just enough time to walk down the street to Haymarket to get a beer, and were immediately seated after getting the text / returning to the restaurant.Will definitely be returning to try something else on their extensive menu!"
Great and interesting menu! Went in for dinner on a Tuesday while in town for work. Got there at 5:30 and there were plenty of people but no wait. By the time we finihed and left around 7 there were a few people that waited no more than 10 minutes and those were larger groups of people (6 or more).We tried the crunchy shrimp cockail and knew right away we were going to love this place. The shrimp were wrapped in thin asian noodles and fried and they were delicious! The rest of our meal was just as tasty.
"Nothing new to say here: great portion sizes, an overwhelming number of menu items that all sound delicious, prices that won't break the bank. A few tidbits:-kimchi is legit. There was one breakfast item that had a crepe with kimchi and egg... the kimchi was delicious, almost like my granny's. That doesn't like breakfast food, you say? You're right, but it is still delicious.-Mac & cheese was just ok. I never turn down a mac&cheese, but this one didn't have me clamoring for seconds."
"We thoroughly enjoyed the Bulls eye french toast, chorizo & crumpets,  and fat elvis. All were delicious and well worth the wait. The only downside was the noise- we had to shout to talk.  It was even hard to hear the hostess."
Went to Little Goat with my sister before the Black Hawks game. After eating at the Girl and the Goat across the street I was expecting a similar concept. I was quite surprised when we entered and it was a old style dinner with a twist. The service here was very friendly. While they didn't have any open tables we were able to be seated right away at the counter. We didn't make a reservation so was great to be able to get right in. The decor is 50's dinner down to the awesome 50's style wall paper and cool old school booths and counter top seating. The menu has everything from your Normal Burger all the way to a Goat Almighty topped with goat meat and Braised beef. Wanting to be adventurous I decided to try the Los Downed. While waiting at the counter we could see everyone's orders come up. All I could think was wow the portions here are massive. This place knows how to feed you. When my Sandwich came it was massive. This place didn't skimp at all. The hogie bread was loaded with tender braised beef. The Peppers and Onions were a nice addition of flavor and were not over done. The butterkase cheese also added a ton of flavor. The way all the ingredients blended together really made this sandwich stand out.. Only downside is it was messy but this was to be expected given its massive size. Would go back in a heart beat although I will have to give one of the burgers a try next time because they looked great!!!
"Little Goat does a great job of putting a fun spin on the standard diner and doing it in a great looking, although incredibly loud, setting.We hit up Little Goat for lunch around 1:00 on Monday and we were seated within 5 minutes. The place was packed so I was very happy we were seated quickly. Everything is ""a la cart"" so if you order a burger or sandwich, you'll want to get a side also. I choose the fried pickles and onion rings and all American beef burger.  My partner got the patty melt beef burger and the smoked fires. We both loved the fried pickles and the accompanying dipping sauces. My onion rings were awesome and reminded me of the ones I used to get as a kid at my favorite restaurant. My burger was very tasty. It reminded me of the burgers at Frisch's Big Boy, and that's a good thing. Partner loved his patty melt burger. But we both devoured the smoked fires.  They had a great flavor and made them stand out over regular french fries.  After we finished our meal, we walked next to door to Little Goat's coffee and bread shop and grabbed some exceptional Americanos.While the food was good, the place was incredibly loud.  To the point that I couldn't hear my partner across the table.  And service seemed a bit off. It looked like they were training a lot of new people. They were incredibly slow with drink refills. Right before we received our burgers, our waiter asked if we wanted more lemonade and we said sure.  Our lemonades finally showed up as we were receiving the bill.  Yeah, it's minor but I would expect a little more hustle from the staff on something as quick & easy as getting drinks.We enjoyed our lunch and we look forward to going back. I'll just go in knowing that I won't be able to hear anything my dining partner says and order two drinks ahead of time."
"Came here today with a friend. We waited half an hour for a seat and ended up sitting at the communal table. We ordered quickly and got the burger(wing style) and the bulls-eye french toast. We also ordered the Little Goat Specialty drink. The bulls-eye french toast was just A-OK. I thought that it left something to be desired. It was tasty, but it wasn't extremely good. The burger was really good, but it was kind of salty. Lastly the drink itself was not too good. Personally, I don't like the taste of goat  or lamb because it has a certain taste and smell. I should have known that goat milk would have that taste. HOWEVER, thankfully the server came and noticed that my friend and I didn't touch our drinks at all. She gladly switched it for regular lattes, thank you!A+ for attentiveness!"
"I cannot rave about Little Goat enough!!! My boyfriend and I went there for breakfast yesterday, and it has been on my ""Chicago Bucket List"" since I read about it in the RedEye. My excitement was only heightened after reading all of the reviews on yelp. So here's the skinny on our experience:Interior/Exterior: It's in the West End of the Loop. Having never been there before we were intrigued to go. We were amazed at the beauty of the recent development that is has gone through in the past few years. Little Goat fits in this neighborhood like a missing piece to a puzzle. The neighborhood is charming, and the design compliments the hip and low key attitude of it's residents.  We liked the rotating door that faces the corner, and the potted pine trees on top of the building with twinkle lights. (They can be seen through the main dining rooms skylight too.) The burlap looking canvas shades worked nicely with the slightly distressed bold font on the windows. The inside of the Diner was gorgeous! When we arrived we noticed couples, families and groups of friends dining and eating happily. The setting is very casual and comforting, but modern and retro at the same time. It made me feel super cool and trendy just by walking in the doors. Theme's are created through use of bold textures and patterns: like refurbished wood, aged leather, and the strong presence of metals. I especially loved the light fixtures. (But hey, I'm an electricians daughter through and through.)Having arrived around 8:45 we beat most of the morning rush. Just after settling into our seats, we noticed a massive crowd at the front desk. The poor girls working hostesses were running around, but totally working it like pros.Our waitresses name was Lauren, and she was just as sweet as pie. Not only was she polite, she was always at hand and willing to answer any questions that we had. A+ for service! The other waitstaff was quick to fill water and coffee too. Our coffee was piping hot, and our water ice cold. My boyfriend and I were so excited upon gazing at the menu we could hardly keep the smiles off of our faces. We wanted to try everything, but in the end he ordered the ""Brandade & Belly Benedict"" and I had the infamous ""Bulls Eye French Toast."" (Side note: We're total nerds and take pictures of our food. It's was sooo photo worthy. . )I cannot even begin to explain how aMMMMazing this food is. Upon first bite it  put our regular diner to shame. I can't explain my boyfriends opinion of the ""Brandade & Belly Benedict"" but I took the silence and the MMMM's and Ahh's as a good sign. My  ""Bulls Eye French Toast"" was exactly that. It was dead on the bulls eye! It was a dance of flavors upon my tongue which I had never experienced before. There was sweet, and there was zesty. There was smoky, and then there was a little tart. The textures were incredible. The bread was so fluffy on the inside, yet firm on the crust. At first I thought I was eating cake. I wasn't. This was better than cake. There was crunch and then there was smooth.We were so full halfway through our meals. We looked at each other, and knew we couldn't take leftovers with us to our next destination. So with a smile we found our spare legs and joined the clean plate club with glee. I would recommend Little Goat to anyone. Not only does it feed your belly, it feeds the soul."
"From the FALL IN A GLASS cocktail to the BREAKFAST SPAGHETTI, the FRIED CHICKEN, and FAT ELVIS WAFFLES, you will definitely walk away with an excellent experience.  There are so many flavors and interesting concoctions that sound rather weird at first, but as soon as you dive in, you fully understand.  This is probably my favorite dining experience at the moment.  Hosts are always accommodating and it helps that they now take limited reservations, mostly on weekdays."
"So I've been here for breakfast and dinner. At breakfast on a Saturday, I saw Rahm which I guess is remotely cool. Anyway -- we waited about 40 min from 10am to 11ish... The coffee and bar and bakery in the back is pretty handy while you wait. I had the shrimp and grits which were pretty good. Honestly not much to say about them. Tasty and everything was cooked right.For dinner I had the los drowned sammich and that was one of the best damn sammiches I've ever eaten. I was a little disappointed with the service when we went though -- despite there only being like 10-15 people eating, we waited about 20 min for drinks and our order took quite a while.Nonetheless -- great food!"
"Came here for brunch... fully anticipated the VERY long wait, so put our name in, grabbed a cup of coffee and walked around the neighborhood.  We were hungry by the time our table was ready (60+min).  Really cute inside, although a bit noisy, but that's to be expected with how many people were there eating and waiting.  Bulls Eye French Toast was amazing.  My husband had an asian egg dish... neither of us were fans of that one in particular.  Once seated, fast, friendly & attentive service.  We'll definitely be back- would love to try their lunch menu as the reuben sandwich one of our dining neighbors ordered looked really, really good."
Food was awesome.  My 3 friends and I ordered something and we shared. Everything was delicious and majority of the menu is Asian fusion. Only downfall was a bit pricier.  My shrimp noodle dish some was $18! Everything else was decent price.
"Little Goat is fun for a visit. It won't be a staple on my list, but then again I don't think I am the target customer.Food as you would expect from Stefanie Izard is good. I didn't want to order something greasy/cheesy/meaty tonight (and don't most nights) so I just stuck with a veggie burger and chickpea salad but both were flavorful.The veggie burger had a smoky tomato relish that accompanied it and the dressing in the chickpea salad had an interesting kick. I'd be interested in trying the pancakes and my friends really enjoyed their pickle sandwich and grilled cheese.Service on the other hand could be improved. Our water was warm and the waitress didn't check up on us once. We didn't get water refills until our check came and also couldn't order more drinks. My food was late and she didn't apologize or let us know it was on its way.For those eaters who love greasy diner food, Little Goat is a must. For the more conscious or reserved eaters, it is probably take it or leave it. But either way, it's a fun experience!"
"I've only been here once and really it wasn't enough to form a well rounded opinion. Their menu selection is wide and very unique. We went for dinner and the food was super rich and amazing. We both had the pork loin and it was something else...so rich that I couldn't finish it, which is definitely not my usual MO. My girl can't have dairy and they were very accommodating. The waitress made a mistake on our order so she included desert for free. I had the pork toffee shake but honestly it was nothing special. I definitely want to try out their breakfast selection so I'll be back!"
"Went for brunch on a Sunday, about a 45 min wait. Worth the wait - the food was pretty great. The cinnamon roll was covered in icing and nice and soft. The blueberry pancakes seemed to be chock full of fresh blueberries and came w/chunks of streusel topping and cream cheese butter (wow!). The french toast on an egg w/strawberries, chicken tenders, and maple syrup were a bit too many flavors for me, but good in certain combinations. Oddly enough - the hash browns were my favorite thing there. Super thin shreds and i think cheese in the middle while being super crispy on the outside.I asked for hot sauce w/my omelet - they brought an orange habanero sauce and a smoky red sauce - both delicious! Rooftop bar was so cute and the bakery had so many delicious looking items (rhubarb pistachio muffins). I will definitely be back (and want to try the fat elvis waffle)."
"Dare I say I don't love Little Goat nearly as much as I love Girl and Goat.  I think I shall.  We got there around 10:50 a.m. on a Sunday.  The wait was an hour and a half which was inevitable given how popular this place is.We are both huge fans of breakfast food so once again we ignored the lunch menu.I opted for the omelette of the day which came stuffed with lots of vegetables and cream cheese and a side of wheat toast.  My husband ordered the sour apple pancake and the sides of hash browns and gunthorp farm bacon.  The omelette of the day was good but I was not having an ""oh wow"" moment.  It was a bit on the greasy side.  The hash browns and bacon were both greasier than last time.The spiced apple pancake with cream cheese butter and crunchy oatmeal crumble was probably the best of everything we had.  I had a bloody mary to wash it all down; probably not a drink I will order again.  The staff is super friendly and fabulous as always.  The decor is so very cool.  I'll probably be back...................the mega menu with enticing titles seems to want to lure me back in."
"I have gotten bagels and pastries from the bread side a couple of times and only eaten in the restaurant once, so this review is for my limited experiences. The bagels and cream cheese are good, and I really enjoy the unusual flavors.  The bagels themselves are tasty but don't expect a good New York-quality bagel. I have made bagels at home before and these are on par with what I made.  They are time-consuming to make, so thank goodness for bagel places, right?? I really like the everything bagel with green bean cream cheese. The grumpy goat bagel (raisins and cheese) is great with the honey masala cream cheese--a little sweet-salty combo. I've also tried the mushroom butter and it's delicious, but the portion is hefty--so you may want to get it on the side unless you loooove a ton of butter on your bagel!  Scones were tasty, but nothing revolutionary. As for the diner side, I am one of those who tends to test a place like this with a simple order the first time out. We went for breakfast, so I feel like if a place can't make good scrambled eggs, well...I'm not sure if I will go back for eggs.  So ordered my scrambled eggs and bagel. Bagel was good as usual, of course.  The scrambled eggs were basically dry diner-style scrambled eggs.  Now I realize that eggs are very personal, and one person may like them barely cooked while another would like them dry and in sheets.  I like mine more on the cooked side, but other than that I'm not terribly picky as long as they taste good.  Well, these were cooked even for me.  There are plenty of other diners that make better scrambled eggs than this.  To me, if you can't scramble an egg well, maybe it's time to revisit the basics.  My husband ordered the Spanish omelette, which was massive.  It comes with tomatoes, peppers, cheese, and tortilla chips on top.  It wasn't bad, but for $14 we were both expecting more. Not in quantity because it was huge, but just in terms of quality execution.  Again, the eggs were pretty overcooked.  I'm fairly sure I could have made that pretty easily at home, which is not a good thing to think about a $14 breakfast dish!All in all, I would only go back if I happened to be right there and there was no wait.  I don't think I would be willing to stand in line here."
"Little Goat - you have a new devoted fan! We arrived for brunch around 10:30 on Sunday morning - just in time to miss the crowds - and were seated immediately at the bar. Not sure if it's the best or worst seat in the house as you have the opportunity to see every amazing entree that comes out and second guess your order the entire time. I've tried the bull's eye french toast (eggs . crispy chicken . sweet onion brioche . bbq maple syrup) which was incredible, a special omelet which was a Mexican style and so good that I was forced to continue eating until I was borderline sick, and the honey yogurt and house granola which was also delicious, but there are so many good things on this menu, it seems like a better idea to order one of the more unique options. Their coffee and mimosas are also killer, don't miss out on either ;) I can't wait to go back and try more of the amazing menu! Keep in mind that they don't take reservations and there's usually a line so I would recommend going early or off hours. If you live nearby you can drop your name in and they'll call you when you're about to be seated."
"My sister came to visit from Pittsburgh and we were looking for a place close by that we could walk to on the West Loop. I saw this place on my Yelp and I hit the pavement to check it out. It's been a few months since I was there, but the place adds interesting fusions to all of the dishes and I remember my pork loin sandwich to be great, although I forgot that it would be fried and I'm not a huge fan of fried foods. The prices aren't too unreasonable especially for the area."
"I've been to Little Goat 3 times now, and it wasn't until last night that I decided that this is a proper 4 star place. I've seen good improvement in the nuts and bolts of running a new restaurant (servers are now more knowledgeable, kitchen seems to be working together more cohesively), and as a result, I've seen marked improvements in the food. Granted, there are some dishes that still need to be overhauled (Loco Moco, I'm looking at you), but some of the dishes are AMAZING. Last night I had a love affair with the Chicken Cordon Bleu sammich. My friends were a little uncomfortable, but you know what, it was THAT good. I dreamt about it. The pulled pork sammich wasn't drowning in BBQ sauce (a good thing for those of us who like to taste the main ingredients; anyone can grab a bottle of Sweet Baby Ray's and drown their food in it if they want that), and the Los Drowned is such a beautiful version of a braised beef sammich. The smoked fries and the fried pickled onions & pickles (YEP, they pickle the onion which gives the dish some extra zest) are must haves. The decor is classy but definitely reminiscent of a diner; it's just a more upscale, classy diner. Luckily they still retain the artery clogging grease in some of their dishes so that it's a faithul interpretation. Little Goat Bread turns into the house bar after 6PM or so, and it's a nice place to grab a quick drink if you have to wait for a table (which if you do have to wait, has been a fairly short period). There's so much more to talk about, but I'll end on this: there's a reason I keep going back to Little Goat, but there is definitely room for improvement. Given that its only been open for a couple of weeks, I fully expect it to get up to 100% soon, and time will tell if this 4 star review can claw its way up to 5. And you know what? I like its chances."
"Love this place. The Fat Elvis waffle are to die for, I don't think there is anything bad on their menu."
"Very good. Huge sandwiches- and that's coming from someone that eats a lot. Price) Little pricey, but you get good portions.Quality) Food is good! We had the boo boo baise, braised  beef, grilled cheese, chicken and waffles, smoked fries and milk shake. The boo boo baise was superb and the braised beef was like a tastier italian beef. The smoked fries were pretty amazing and unique too. Quantity) A+. I love to eat and I eat huge portions so this did not disappoint. I was definitely satisfied walking out. Atmosphere) Cute diner setupStaff) Very gracious. Great waitress and she took care of us. We did have to wait a bit to get her attention, but she came by and helped us out.I would recommend taking the shared table so you can sit down and start eating."
So darn good. I came here alone so I sat at the counter.  I think this is probably the best seat in the house for someone like me who eats with her eyes before ordering.  I ended up getting the crispy fish tostadas.  They're heavy but very very good.  I also started with a tomato and apple soup.  It's good but I don't really taste apple in it.I'd definitely come here again.  Not too many options for those that don't eat pork or beef or goat... but still good.
"There is always a wait, but you can make it fun at Little Goat! There is a coffee/bread area you can get snacks or good coffee. Once you are seated, the menu has endless amazing choices. When in season, I highly suggest the blueberry pancakes & the burrito. The pancakes are incredible, best blueberry pancakes I can say I've ever ever had. The chef of this place is incredible, I PROMISE it's worth the wait!"
I feel bad to give 3 stars but I want to be honest. I had the crispy shrimp cocktail and the tomato apple soup. The soup was way too sour and didn't taste the apple flavor at all. The crispy shrimp cocktail was alright but the coat of crispy noodles was soggy and had an unpleasant texture. The cocktail sauce could have been better. My friend had the spiced apple pancakes and it was decent except it did not have enough apples to it. I expected better food... It was a little disappointing.
"Three of us headed to Little Goat for a little guy-time at about 8:15 pm on a Friday night.  It was hopping when we arrived, and we expected the hour-long wait.  We made our way over to the crowded bar and found a nice little plat of real estate to park ourselves for a few beers.  That beer selection is small, but well done... and I supose large for a ""diner"".  I stuck with the Perrenial Farmhouse ale for the pre-game drinks.One fun and informative touch to their ""seating method"" is that they text you from time to time to let you know where you are in the que.  For example, after about 45 minutes, they texted to say that our table would be ready soon and to close-out our bar tab and meet the hostess in 5 minutes.  Easy enough!We were seated at one of the booths in the center of the dining area.  It was comfortable arrangements and pretty casual inside.  The booth reminded me of a diner for sure.  Most people were wearing the typical casual randolph restaurant attire.Our server was very pleasant, but straight to the point.  He made no bones about what he recommended... and he said it with such authority, that it was hard not to order much of what he suggested.  We started with the pickled onion rings, which were fantastic.  We then moved to the Boo Boo Baise (mussels, shrimp and whitefish). This was decent, but not sure I would get it again.  We then had the hot crab dip with ritz crackers. We loved this!  We had the goat sloppy joe as well, which tasted like the goat and girl and the goat.  Tasty!  We also had the trout, which was fine.  We ended it with a meringue pie, which was a perfect cap!All in all, we had a great time, good service and good food.  Definitely will go back!"
"Be prepared to wait! I highly recommend the goat chili it was delicious! The kimchee burger was just ""meh"" the burger itself was very well done even though we ordered medium. The biscuits and gravy were also very good! I will definitely be going back and trying some other items on the menu"
"When I first read the menu kimchi and bacon pancakes caught my attention.  I was thinking about kimchi and pork pancakes my mother used to make when I was growing up.  Of course I did not think it would taste the same but I was very curious to try it.   So I ordered kimchi, bacon, and egg pancake. My husband ordered Korean style hamburger.  My daughter chose the simple breakfast, two eggs with toast and maple sausage. We also ordered a side of Brussels sprouts with almonds Kimchi in the pancake was too salty for me.  I removed the kimchi and ate the rest.  If they add all the ingredients in the pancake and add some flour to make it look like regular pancake I probably like it better. My husband loved his hamburger.  It was cooked just the way he wanted.  Maple sausage and  Brussels sprouts were great.   Excellent service."
"Went back last night because we wanted something in the area, but on the slightly cheaper side. Won't be going back again. This time we had:fried chicken: where it was delightfully salty last time, this time it felt like I was eating chicken flavored salt. I couldn't finish it even though I was famished from not having eaten lunch.chicken cordon bleu: the bun doesn't really hold up for this sandwich, the chicken wasn't very tasty but at least it wasn't over-cooked, the ""cordon bleu"" part was okay but nothing worth ordering againbeef ravioli: not very appetizing, can't put my finger on why, my wife could only eat half even though she too was starvinggarlic cheese bread: this was amazing. ""peppermint matty"": The waitress described it was peppermint cake/brownie topped with vanilla and chocolate ice cream. That sounds amazing! But for some reason she didn't mention that hefty pinches of pepper hidden about halfway through. That brought things to a rather unpleasant end - I'm not saying that it was bad but it's definitely something that needs to be advertised so that people who don't care for spice in their dessert can avoid it.Bleh. I'll just be saving my nickels for visits to Girl & the Goat (still one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago) and the Bread side of Little Goat for their amazing croissants and baguettes."
"I went here on a recent afternoon/early evening when looking for De Cero. I was with a friend of mine that I wouldn't describe as a picky eater, but he's definitely particular.  I hadn't yet been to the Little Goat Diner and was eager to try it if only because Girl and the Goat is one of my favorite restaurants.  I will need to come back; we ordered the kimchi wings, I got the Pork Belly Pancake and my buddy got a Tuna melt.  All three items were outstanding.  I ordered a cookie pie to go as we were leaving, mostly because I have no shame, and of all the things we ordered that was the closest to being a disappointment.  That was probably more because I built this magical cookie pie up to epic proportions in my mind after the rest of the meal than because it was at all bad.  You don't come crying to me, anthropomorphic Cookie Pie, you have the Pork Belly Pancake and Kimchi Wings to blame for my poor rating of you.  Take it up with them and leave me out of it."
"I didn't realize this place was all the rage. I just stumbled across while walking bye, and by the likes of the crowd waiting to be seated, I thought I found a winner.  Being that I was only a table of one, I was happy to sit at the counter. The hostess took to me the end of the counter, where it was busier than Grand Central Station, with the entrance to the kitchen, wait staff, etc....I asked to be seated on the other end of the counter where there were two available stools.  I was told I couldn't sit there because they were for 2 people.  I scratched my head as I waited about 15 minutes for another place at the counter to open up. And out of that 15 minutes of waiting, the two seats I was eye balling were empty for about 10 minutes of that time before the hostess seated a couple there.  So after 15 minutes, another couple left the counter and I was seated.  Not sure why I wasn't seated at the available seat at the counter the first time around.  The hostess isn't great at the math ratio.  I was excited about ordering the food because my seat was right across from the kitchen serving area where I could see all the great food being passed out. However, with that view came the heat from the kitchen, as it's only a couple of feet away.  A bit warm.  I ordered the SMOKED CORNED BEEF HASH WITH EGGS, but what I received was HASH WITH EGGS TABLESPOON OF CORNED BEEF. I couldn't tell if the corned beef was smoked or not because there wasn't enough of it to find its way to my taste buds.       For $13.00?  That was a joke!  Where's the beef?"
"We came on a Sunday afternoon for brunch and the place was packed out the door.  Eat a snack first if you are coming on a weekend morning because you'll probably be waiting up to 60 minutes.Once you get seated, have a 'upscale diner' atmosphere.  Coffee is rich and distinctive.  Staff is very friendly and attentive.  Prices are very reasonable for this trendy block.  Brunch for two can be had for less than $35 all in.  Lots of fun and creative things to try on the menu."
"went here for a little bday celebration and decided to be brave and order the goat almighty. was i in for it or what? 3 kinds of meat: goat burger, braised beef, and bbq pork.  goat burger tasted a bit funny, for a first timer. would i order it again? no...too much meat and not enough anything else. ordered some tempura fried mashed potatoes...not bad. but the fries deep fried in bacon fat? idk what they do but BEST FRIES by far....holy cow....crab dip, also delish.would i come here again? i'd like to try their brunch menu, think it looks more appetizing and better selection than dinner. maybe theyll change to a 4 star rating after i try their brunch....we'll see."
"I had been dying to try Little Goat. I LOVE Girl and the Goat so I had to go to Little Goat right?I love that the diner accommodates children. My daughter and I went in for lunch. It's a diner so I took my chances having her as my lunch date. She was given crayons, a 3d coloring activity menu and 3d glasses. Coolness!! Small wait. Texted when our table was ready. We waited in the car. Boom. Within 20 minutes we were in. I ordered the tempura mashed potatoes and the Reuben ""SAMMICH"". The menu is super cute. My daughter wasn't hungry and was quite disappointed with the chocolate milk. I tasted it and agreed. Don't get chocolate milk there. Folks if you're a healthy eater most of the time like I try to be, you will feel guilty about whatever you order to eat at this fancy Greasy Spoon! Everything was very good but my guilt made it "" just ok"" as far as my rating goes. But A must try spot overall."
Great food and decor.  Always a wait but the bar is a nice spot to hang and grab a coffee or beer while you wait for a table.  The draft list is stellar.  Had the macho nachos and the Los drowned - which were perfect for my hangover.  Good music and friendly staff.
"This place is insanely delicious. I'm a supertaster, so a lot of the ""new"" or ""exciting"" gourmet for the masses doesn't fly with me. I LOVE the gourmet diner atmosphere. Great craft beer selection. Best onion rings I've ever had. The beef sandwich I had was killer and rich beyong belief. And their deserts? Pork milkshake? Just try it. Their portions are perfect - depending on what you order you'll likely have leftovers due to the delicious richness of everything they make.However, I would agree with most people that it is not worth waiting 2 hours for a table, unless there's a dish you know you just can't live without there. On busy nights it can get pretty loud in there."
"This place is great!   Went at 9am on a Sunday with our kids (3 year olds) and friends with 2 year olds, for 4 kids and 4 adults - no wait, $7 valet parking, and absolutely great food!    Get the Elvis Pancakes!!!"
"Yo IZ, I got a bone to pick with ya.   I have grown up loving corned beef hash, and you have now ruined that dish for me everytime I order it away from LG.   It's been a couple hours and I am still dreaming of your corned beef hash, the finely long thin shreds of potatoes, chopped onions, and thin slices of perfectly tender yet with a terrific slight crisp corned beef.    I took a star off because the over easy eggs were overcooked a bit.  But I will be back. So now when I order CBH at some other joint, I'll be eating theirs but thinking of yours.  Am I bitter about this?  Hell yeah!  I hope someone shreds all your bandanas!  May you wake up and find a goats head in your bed!  And your coffee cups rock! What is that, 12oz?  I don't want a 6oz cuppie and have waitstaff filling it every 2 minutes.  Thanks!OK, I feel better now.  See you again.  Soon!"
"We went at 9:30am on Memorial Day and waited about 45 minutes for a booth. We started with the Machos Nachos, which were really good. For our mains, we ordered the Los Drowned and the Pork Belly Pancake. The food came quickly and was absolutely delicious.Other than our server, who was a bit snooty, I'd say that Little Goat lives up to the hype!"
"Think old school diner meets incredibly creative chef.  Awesome place to eat.  I love the little bar in the back, don't miss it.  The Bloody Mary is phenom."
"Absolutely amazing experience in all.  Had the crab dip to start, which is an absolute must, best I've ever had.  Then the Reuben, which basically melted apart while eating it, incredible.  The atmosphere was perfect for the diner setting, and the portion size was well within control and away from the normal insane American standards.  Tried the Cookie Pie for dessert, creative and tasty!  Can't recommend this place enough, you need to go!"
"Overall I enjoyed my experience at Little Goat.  Went there for lunch and had a hard time deciding what to order, so many good options.   I went with the Ruben, it was very tasty, the kimchee on it was a nice touch and added to the sandwich.  Only complaint was it was very messy to eat and had too much ""special sauce"" on it.    The smoke fries and mac-and-cheese were also tasty.  I wasn't a huge fan of the hash browns.  The house made soda was amazing, it was cucumber/apple flavor, highly recommended.  The service was top notch - waitress was very helpful and provided lots of insight and suggestions. I am looking forward to going back and trying more of the menu."
"Believe the hype! The shrimp sandwich is a must. Big, fresh shrimp with a nice spicy mayo, slaw and miso chips on fresh baked bread. Need I really say more? The staff was very friendly, super helpful. Plenty of samples being given away on the bread side (which this review is for). They have a nice hot cider. Cute little display of ""little goat"" things for purchase.I will definitely be back to the bread side and I am looking forward to trying the diner side as well."
"Probably the best Bloody Mary I've had in a long time...tasted like it had smoky bacon in the mix and it was served with a cream cheese filled olive! Yum! We had to wait awhile for our table but it was fun to wait in the bakery side where the bar was. The restaurant side was bright and mainly lit from an enormous skylight. The atmosphere was perfect for brunch and the retro decor was cool and not overdone. Our server was great, not overly chipper, and was quick to grab our last minute coffee order at the end. She reminded me of Zooey Deschanel. I ordered the veggie burger patty melt. The burger was great and had chunks of mushrooms in it, a real veggie burger! I had hoped a patty melt came with Swiss cheese but that was my only complaint. It was a build your own burger idea and I really liked that, although I think most of the options were better suited towards goat and beef burgers. The fries were spectacular! My boyfriend had the corned beef hash, and although it was a simple dish he said it was delicious. I'd definitely go back the next time in town."
"I somehow ended up visiting Little Goat twice in the past week. The first time was for a late-night bite after a cocktail party across the street. I went incredibly hungry and was eager to try their burger. I'm a huge fan of patty melts, but was disappointed that their's was served with American cheese (rather than Swiss). No problem, I thought, I'll just ask for a cheese substitution. Bummed out when I learned they didn't even have Swiss cheese, but I ordered it anyway with a ""mild white cheese"" (as described by the server). I was told they normally cook their burgers medium and figured it would be a thin griddle style burger, in keeping with their diner style, so I said that was fine. The burger was actually thicker than expected and quite a few notches past medium. Sad that the sandwich didn't come with a pickle or coleslaw or anything...The second visit was for breakfast. Arrived early (7:30a) to be told they were not open because they were having mechanical issues. They directed us to the bakery (just east of the restaurant space) and gave me a coupon for a free coffee. We waited for about 15 minutes and were sat. Considering everyone was sat at one time, the service staff and kitchen handled it amazingly well. Our server, Erik, offered his opinion on his favorites and promptly gave my dining companion the gluten-free menu when she said she had an intolerance. I ordered the kimchi-bacon-egg-pancake-tasty thing and it was really delicious!"
"Popped in last night (Saturday) at about 7:30.  It was a 60 min wait for us but with the system they use there they would text us when our table was ready thus allowing us to head out for drinks elsewhere.We sat at the counter and if your a diner fan like I am than you know this is the place to be. A very energetic atmosphere.  The staff was simply amazing.  Our primary server was very attentive and helpful.  The POS went on the fritz shortly after we sat down.  Due to everyone needing to hand in tickets and needing to hang around for orders me and my buddy basically met and and talked with most of the staff at some point including Chef Izard.  If the food was average I would still come back for the service.. it was that good.But... the food was awesome as wellI got the Blue Plate special of beef cheek stroganoff.  Still thinking about it today.Friend got the breaded pork tenderloin. Now, since I'm originally from Iowa where the breaded pork tenderloin was perfected I can say this was done very well.Sitting at the counter also allowed us to see all the other dishes coming out.  On my next trip the french toast will be my order.One last thing... smoked pork and English toffee milkshake?!?!  Seriously?!?!I thought ""what the hell"" and got one.  First bite was a bit odd but it just kept getting better after that until it was gone."
"I will definitely go back to Little Goat! I ended up venturing out to LG on a last minute date (1AM) if you want to call it that. I had the Los Drowned and my ""date"" (super flakey female) had the Bull's Eye French Toast and both were absolutely delicious. So many different flavors all married together so nicely. I had a cocktail as well and it was also very good. I definitely will recommend this place if you're up for waiting for a table. I hear they have long waits during the day and in the evening. Just make sure you have good company!"
"My husband and I visited the Little Goat Diner for brunch recently while we were in Chicago for the Pearl Jam concert recently. Stephanie Izard seems to have really done it right by taking her time getting her places up and running after her Top Chef win. The hour-long wait was a bit daunting, but we toughed it out, and boy -- were we glad we did. Simply put, the food was awesome. I had the Shrimp and Cheesy Grits. As a Southerner born and raised, I was interested to see a non-Southern take on such a classic dish. I was not disappointed. It was delicious -- better even than some shrimp & grits that I've actually had in the South.My husband had The Fat Club sammich, which he raved about. He now thinks every sandwich should have avocado on it.We also split an order of the Smoked Fries, which were thin shoestring fries -- crispy and delicious.Needless to say, with a wait time of an hour, the place was bustling and noisy, but not obnoxiously so. We spent our time waiting in the bakery next door, and a rooftop patio is available as well (would have been nice if it wasn't sweltering outside). While waiting, Stephanie walked right by us, which was kind of cool.Service was good, if a tad slow at times.Overall, an excellent dining experience -- we'll be back the next time we're in Chicago."
"bright environment. but average food.  don't know....have you read Pete Well's Guy's American Kitchen & Bar in Times Square revoew? (nytimes.com/2012/11/14/d…)that is how i feel about this place. service was average to good but the food was a little crazy. you can't really go wrong with tonkatsu but they made it into a sandwich.  with just plain white bread.  so it consisted of cheap tonkatsu (cheap cause it's thin and doesn't have a lot of meat inside the batter) and they just put 2 slices of toasted white bread (without the crumbs so thumbs up for that).  what happened was, my brother and i both got the tonkatsu but then the waitress came back and asked something about the tonkatsu sandwich.  we were both like,""wait, what?!"" but we couldn't complain because the tonkatsu item was inside the ""Sammie"" section of the menu for sandwiches.  so we just missed it.  just never heard of making tonkatsu patties into a sandwich.....and i hope to never run into this monster in the future. it was horrible.  just had the patties. but again, couldn't complain cuase it was our fault for missing this detail.another member of our party ordered the kalbi dish but it didn't taste too much like kalbi.  a lot of glazing with something that was too sweet.  the only good dish was the loco moco.  loco moco (fell in love with this in hawaii) is usually just rice, burger patties (or spam, etc) and thick sauce.  what they provide you is a bit more colorful and flavorful and it was good.  still, i saw the 5-6 dishes that came out and thought that there is such a thing as being too creative.....it just felt like she took a traditional food and wanted to do something really crazy and did. y not, it's her restaurant.  not impressed.  won't be going back altho, loco moco was a success."
"My wife and I tried Little Goat Diner on Saturday.  What can I say after all of these rave reviews?   Besides, this place is a part of Girl And A Goat - we had high expectations when we arrived.  What?  1.5 hour wait!?!  No problem, we have high expectations, we'll wait. How do we keep track of our position in line? They have a slick text messaging system to keep you updated on your position on your mobile device.  Damn near everyone in the place waiting for a table had a phone in their hands and were nervously refreshing their mobile device.Were our expectations fulfilled?  Well, sort of, table service was excellent.  Seriously, if you come in, ask to be seated with Ezra.  His service and sense of humor are fantastic.  As for the food, I must say that the food did not live up to our expectations or the inflated prices.  In fact, we found the food a bit pretentious for a ""gastronomic diner"".  We were there for late breakfast (me) early lunch (wife).  Here's what we had:1.  Corned Beef Hash and Eggs - sides ala carte.  So, side of potatoes and bagel extra - forget the bagel (smear extra too).  Ezra, I'd like the eggs basted.  What's basted?  Ezra, this is Chicago.  If the cooks don't know what a basted egg is tell them over easy then go find a cook that does, or alternatively I'll go in the kitchen and show them.  Ezra, I'd like the side of potatoes burned to a crisp.  In fact I want them so crisp that your tip depends on crispness.  Little did I know that the ""corned beef hash"" was really greasily prepared corned beef with (the same as the side) hash brown potatoes layered on top, not mixed with the corned beef.  Portion size?  Meh.  The side of potatoes came well after the corned beef hash and eggs - in fact we had to ask.  The potatoes were crisp and floating in more oily greasiness.  Portion size?  More meh, although I couldn't digest much for the oil.  Good news, the eggs were basted, but the whites were edge burned.  Oh well, they fried (sic).Breakfast observation:  LG is trying too hard to raise the gastronomic level of breakfast food.  I chose corned beef hash and eggs because there was one omelette on the menu.  There were numerous egg choices, however Kimchi and eggs (as an example) is not my first breakfast choice.  There were numerous pancake choices - not my cup of tea unless they're buckwheat (fat chance).  Heck, breakfast is breakfast!  Go to Meli or Yolk or Ina's (she has a parking lot and is just down Randolph).2.  Korean Burger - sides ala carte.  My wife ordered a Mac & Cheese side. She enjoyed the burger, which she said was way too much food and the Kimchi too bland.  She also liked the Mac & Cheese, but observed that the portion was shareable.  That said, my wife said she preferred the burgers at The Burger Bar or the Lockdown Bar and Grill (Kuma's Corner, not so much).Value:  We were there a total of three hours including the wait.  All of this fun cost a mere $45, plus a $10 tip for Ezra, plus $10 bucks for the valet.  What?  $10 bucks to park a car on Randolph and Halsted on Saturday afternoon?  Yup!  Be careful of the legal-looking parking space trap in front of LG.  The sign indicating Valet Parking is half a block to the right of LG.  The valet appears out of nowhere after you've unwittingly grabbed that beckoning parking space.  Since you don't have a clue how long the wait is, once you've committed your ride to the valet, your stuck with the wait."
"Thursday afternoon and the place was slammed. They take your name and send a text when your table is ready, so that was a definite plus! We went for a walk to check out all the new places that have popped up on Randolph, browsed the cafe part of the restaurant and then time was up.To start, they have a ton of delicious beers to choose from and a few different cocktails-a mezcal tequila cocktail was ordered as MEZCAL IS AWESOME! However, our drinks coming out were prettyyyyyyyy slow-like we got our appetizer before even getting our drinks. Not too big of a deal, but when the other people I was dining with just ordered beer, it seemed strange. The lobster dip was served with a measley six Ritz crackers, so that was a bummer. Everything else was spot on!I got the pork belly pancake (getting quite the buzz and rightfully so!) in addition to trying the broccoli and cheese puff. If you're from the Midwest, you surely know these. It tasted like those little puff pastry casserole bites your family used to make for special gatherings. I also tasted their version of an italian beef sandwich  **DROOL, the sweet potato tempura side and both I would definitely get again. Also tasted the tuna melt and garlic mashed potatoes. Both were good staples but nothing I was wowed by.  The icing on the cake of the entire visit was to see Stephanie working the line in the open air kitchen. So excited!"
"What a menu!  Breakfast, sandwiches, entrees, and dessert.  I hardly know where to begin as it all looked delicious and a bit overwhelming at times...The restaurant itself is setup like a diner with stool seating along a bar and several booths along with with a community seating table.  In the back there is a small bar within the bakery/coffee shop where you can get a drink while waiting for your table.  Neat little hipster setup with friendly and efficient staff in both areas of the restaurant.The menu is incredible - someday I will taste the Elvis waffle and try several of the unique sandwich options.  As a group we ate the fried pickles and onion rings (lightly battered and delicious), the cinnamon roll (gooey and delicious), their take on the sloppy Joe, the jerk burger and a steak sandwich.  All of which came in a generous portion size and were delicious.  Definitely bring your appetite to this place because it feels like home cooked comfort food... all you need is a lazy boy for after the meal.  While you are at it - you might as well put away a shake or malt along with your meal as they are delicious.Little goat makes for a great brunch place or a place to go if you are very very hungry (or like to share...).  Enjoy the casual vibe and the great food."
"This place is awesome.  Been twice and have not been disappointed with the food.  We were able to get a table or booth both times within 10 minutes or so.  Would be 5 stars, but both times the server could have been more attentive/had a less overwhelming section to take care of.If you have a big group, be aware they have community seating.  Not a big deal to me, but maybe to some."
"We went for a Saturday morning brunch, so we expected to have a wait to get in. I did appreciate that they text you when your table is ready, however in a Chicago winter, I'm not very prone to go wandering outside of the nice warm restaurant. Overall, the service was very good. Our food was interesting. I had the Spiced Apple Pancakes. They were good, but there was a flavor in them that I was not expecting, more of a spicy flavor than a sweet flavor. It wasn't bad, just unexpected. The garlic potatoes as a side, however, were fabulous and melt in your mouth good. I'm not sure I'd go back for breakfast, but I would be interested in trying their lunch menu. I think the flavors might be better for lunch than breakfast."
You should eat here.
"Great Place, have never been disappointed.  I've gotten used to coming here in the later afternoon to avoid the wait, especially on a Sunday!We started with Machos Nachos, the best chips in the city.  I love the pickled peppers and the sweet pork. I got a salad this time, the smoked chicken and noodles.  It was great and light.  I've had the Los Drowned before, huge, and the cooked corned beef hash is probably the best I've ever had.  same goes for the Fat Club. Great drinks and great service every time.  They just need to bump up the AC, it was a little stuffy today. I am a huge fan, if only they had those  shishito peppers from the other restaurant I'd be in heaven."
"Great Mac and cheese, OUTSTANDINGLY_DANGEROUSLY_RICHLY_SWEETLY peanut butter waffles.  (I couldn't think of any more delicious adverbs to add)  The atmopshere was old-fashioned with a modern twist.  I would come back here again...In fact, I have been dying to go back to try something else off the menu.  Can you guess what I had??? Bottom line great new place in Chicago that will impress you."
"We had the little goat cater the bread for a luncheon at our office.  This was a great decision made by the bosses.  The bread chosen was the Wheat, Broccoli Cheddar, and the Spicy Sun-dried tomato.  Each loaf had much personality and the taste was very interesting and well made.  Would absolutely choose the Little Goat for their loaves in the future."
"I enjoyed my visit to Little Goat after having tried several times but never getting in because the line has always just been too long on the weekends.  Can't blame them for success of course, just made it all the more worth it when we finely got in.  The décor is that of an upscale diner with a visible kitchen, wood floors, and comfortable booths.  It seats a good number of people, probably close to two hundred or more.  If you go fairly early on a weekday you'll probably get seated fairly quickly, however on the weekends you'll be hard pushed to get table.  To be honest, the food was good but I didn't feel that it was anything particularly special.  I had the Croque Monster which is basically just a ham and cheese omelet with a few pieces of crouton on top.  My friend had the standard eggs but said the biscuit was very good.  My dad had the Asian breakfast which is as concoction of kimchi, eggs, and other delightful things.  They definitely get a plus for creativity but I can't say that the tasted wowed me.  The best part of the meal was the cinnamon roll, though even that led to a bit of the complaint.  We'd ordered one to share before our main meals came out just to get a taste and they basically forgot it, not bringing it out until we were almost finished.  I do give them kudos for comping the roll but it was slightly irritating, especially because the diner was not bustling.  All that said, the roll was delicious with a healthy dose of cinnamon that made it quite tasty.  I'll go back, it's a good breakfast, I just don't think I'd wait in a long line to eat there."
Excellent bruch. There is always a long wait so get there early to put your name in and they text you when your table is ready.
"This place was AMAZINGGGGG. I had been to Girl & the Goat in the past and loved it, so my expectations were pretty high. I ordered the pork belly pancake and it was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The decor is really modern and cool in this place, and despite it being jam-packed it was still a relaxing environment to be in. I definitely want to try some of the breakfast food next time I go; literally everything on the menu looks amazing. They don't take reservations though, so be prepared to wait (we waited about an hour for our table...totally worth it though)!"
"Had to try it. Waited in line, but who didn't? Place was packed, loud, buzzing. Friend and I split everything - we went around 2pm. Biscuit (with gravey) was the most memorable thing we ate. The star was the biscuit. We split the Crispy Fun Chicken sandwich - no complaints. Inspiring menu - I would def go back."
"Love this place and the food is great! Today our server obviously was not in the mood to be here, and it was painfully obvious."
"Little Goat was pretty delicious. We wanted to go out for a nice but casual dinner, so we decided to check out LG. We went to Girl and the Goat a few months ago, and it gave us full faith in Stephanie Izard to make me feel happily delicious, so we knew that Little Goat would be a great place to go.I should say, that by no means is Little Goat even comparable to Girl and the Goat--they exist in two separate universes. They are both delicious, but very, very different places. Little Goat was pretty delicious. We started with the Goat Chili Cheese Fries--and they were fantastic! There was some kind of magic that happened when goat meat, cheese and french fries come together in your mouth. It was exhilarating.For entrees, we went with sandwiches. I got the reuben, and the boyfriend got the Los Drowned. The reuben was delicious; there was kimchi on the reuben. KIMCHI ON THE REUBEN! It was a spectacular deliciousness. Boyfriend was a little disappointed with the Los Drowned. He enjoyed it, but wasn't impressed. It was basically a fancier version of an Italian beef sandwich, which by no means is a bad thing, but didn't really send him over the top. Drinks were good--we had a few different drinks from the cocktail menu. They were all pretty tasty.We did make one mistake--when we walked in they offered us a seat at the counter instead of waiting for a table. We took the counter seat and it was a little awkward. It felt super cramped and we were sitting next to where all the staff were going in to grab food. I felt like I was in the way! I wish I would have waited for a table. Overall--the food was good, it was a good environment, and for the price, it was definitely worth it. It's not too expensive and a nice night out. I can't wait to go back and eat breakfast instead of dinner (which they serve all day!). I should also say that there were so many things on the menu that I really want to eat and didn't order (fried pickles and onions!!). I cannot wait to go back and try some of these things!!"
1.Lump crab dip had NO lumps - it was crab flavored cheese dip.2. Corned beef hash was made with what looked like thin sliced pastrami. Lunch meat. Not BEEF beef. If you want great corned beef hash try Cafe Salmarie in Lincoln Square. 3. Fried pickles were soggy & limp.We had great expectations but left disappointed.
"I'm going with a 3.5 on this, but since Yelp gives you the option of 3 or 4, I'll round up. -Service was great. The entire staff was friendly, knowledgeable, and timely. -Atmosphere is fantastic.-The wait for a table is terrible but to be expected. (However, the food came out quickly.)-The food was slightly less creative than I thought it would be. It's tasty, but a little on the predictable side. Overall, if there weren't 2 hour waits, I'd definitely return."
Really great food. Amazing service. Reasonable prices.
"The service was bad. Being called ""sweetheart"" and ""doll"" is kind of endearing when it is a 60 year waitress who has worked at that diner since before you were born. From a young hipster? Not so much. My beverage - ordered at the earliest possible moment after being seated - was delivered when I was halfway done eating my meal. I might give them a bit of a pass if the cafe was really busy and they actually brewed my tea properly, but if all you are doing is delivering hot water with a tea bag in it? That should have been here 20 minutes ago -- before my dining companion got her milkshake, for sure. Also, bringing the check before we are done with the meal is a huge no-no in my book. Check to see if we want dessert! It's a diner. There is a better than average chance we want pie. Pie is the whole point of going to a diner!As for the food -- I got the hash. Don't bother, it is mostly extremely greasy meat. Very little potato! And aside from salt, there was very little flavor. My husband liked his dish -- the Asian breakfast thing, but if I had ordered it I would not have bee able to eat it, there was so much salt.They give you souvenir magnets with the check. I would rather have a slightly cheaper meal than a magnet.I will not return. Definitely not worth the 90 minute wait."
"What an awesome place! Little Goat was my first experience with Stephanie Izard's restaurants and I was very pleased. The aesthetics of the building alone made my night. It's got a really cool vibe, very open but still intimate. The food was great. I had the Fat Elvis Waffles, which were insane. Waffles, bananas, peanut butter and bacon maple syrup. Seriously. I couldn't finish them, because they were so rich, but damn were they good! My sister ordered the Reuben sandwich (she said, ""I don't like reubens, but strangely I'm in the mood for one..."") and she loved it! I had a bite and it was very good. Excellent menu options, lots of fun twists on classic dishes and some great new ideas. The service was excellent, too! Casey was our server and he was wonderful. He offered some great food and drink recommendations based on what we like and were feeling for the night. In taking a look around, I noticed that most of the staff and servers that were taking care of guests were smiling and pleasant. And the guests were happy too! Cool beans. I'm definitely going to have to come back to Little Goat, but I'll also need to visit some of Izard's other establishments! Way to go, guys!"
One of the better breakfast/brunch places I have visited.  Creative menu and delicious flavors makes this a can't miss.
"Kinda disappointed. It was about an hour wait here which I was cool with. We were able to head over to the bakery and nibble on some bread and Little Goat coffee which I believe was made with goat milk and caramel. The coffee was a bit too milky for me, but sorta tasted like a hot chocolate. We got the concha and a sweet onion bread too. They were both pretty good. The concha had a yummy chocolate filling and wasn't too sweet. At this point, I'm feeling pretty hopeful as the place is pretty huge and seemed cool. When we got seated, we ended up at a communal table next to a few folks. I may be dating myself, but it was tight and one of the guys reminded me of an older, creepy Monroe from Too Close For Comfort which was pretty appropriate. We ordered the Los Drowned, which was a good sandwich. Not terribly exciting or inventive but enjoyable. The Bulls eye french toast with fired chicken sounded awesome but our eggs were pretty undercooked and the ratio of chicken was a bit lacking. I'm not talking runny eggs either, because I like that. I was uncooked whites that got our attention. On a whim, we tried the mac and cheese and that ended up being our favorite. Really good white mac and cheese with some stink to it. Liked it a lot. The service was just ok. The waitress was nice enough, but it was pretty sparse, I never got a water refill, it took multiple request to have our leftovers packed up, and they charged me an extra 20 bucks which I had to have them correct.Not a bad meal or time, but kinda disappointed."
"We came here for my husband's birthday. For a Saturday afternoon arriving at 2pm, it was still an hour wait to get a table. I did really like their text app that sent you a text when your table was ready, and also let you see how many tables were in front of you. We had a group of 5 and shared part of the communal table. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, and let us enjoy our meal and his birthday without being overbearing. We were all definitely hungry, so make sure you entire party is with you when your table is called or they will wait to seat you.Everyone got something different and vocally enjoyed their breakfast food, soup, sandwiches. I personally got a cinnamon roll and the eggs benedict. While the 2 items individually tasted great, I think I made a mistake of trying to order both in the same meal. The combination of sweet of cinnamon and the kimchi and braised pork belly didn't taste the greatest after 6-7 bites. I ended up not finishing the benedict, but would try it on it's own again. One of my favorite parts about this place is that they serve Stumptown Coffee. I am a huge fan of Stumptown and have been to the original locations in Portland and Seattle. Glad to see a taste of the PacNW in Chicago."
"Food was good. Ambiance ok. We sat outside bc it was SO loud inside that having a conversation would have been impossible. I got the salmon special. Very good. My boyfriend got the sweet and sour pork chops. He liked them. Not my favorite. Overall, the food was good, but not fantastic. I was sad that for a place that was on a popular street with a lot of other options for dining, this restaurant didn't have a lot of beer selections or, in my opinion, enough food selections. The girl and the goat across the street (& same owners) may be a better bet. For the price you may be better off there."
Came with an appetite so I got what seemed to be the most ridiculous burger on the menu. The Goat Almighty. Properly named and properly delicious. Couldn't finish it all but tasted great reheated a day later. I usually get desert but couldn't get the one breakfast item I actually wanted at 7pm (cinnamon bun) so settled for apple pie instead. Nom nom.
"oh little goat, you adorable rascal of a logo, you. how you lured me in with your irresistible cuteness. thankfully little goat, the restaurant, is every bit as appealing as her logo. first off, the space fits the concept and the decor some how manages to elevate the diner experience while maintaining that precious diner vibe, minus the typical off-putting lighting. it must be that combination of cute and chic that encompasses everything, from the plates to the bar to the wall paper to the napkins.second, the food is excellent. there's a wide variety of options, like your typical diner, but the ingredients don't stray too far from each other. so the kitchen isn't choosing quantity over quality by any means. and by the way, the options are such a fun twist on your typical American diner.I had the privilege of choosing from a substantial dairy free menu. how awesome is that?! this alone would have earned little goat 3 stars, but my order was delicious! I ordered the Korean beef burger which came with bacon, kimchi and a perfectly fried egg. love. it was delicious and there was zero cross contamination. little goat & her little peeps take care of you!I also had the smokey fries and am planning to attempt to replicate them. genius idea!my one warning is that I love salt, so everything was perfectly seasoned for me. others might consider some things slightly too salty. crazy, I know.oh and there's a photo booth... with props. the end."
"Went for lunch with parents on a Friday, didn't wait long at all to be seated. The service and food were both impeccable. A refreshing break from the often pretentious west loop scene. Try the goat!"
reception was a bit sassy to my tourist friends while we decided over waiting for a table or just sitting at the bar- but we opted for the bar and the tender was great- gave us good recommendations and a complimentary drink. will definitely be back for an after dinner cocktail.
"2.5 stars.Went the 2nd day it opened, which probably was a mistake but reading recent newer reviews perhaps its underwhelming in general.I love love Girl and the Goat and was hoping this would be an equal success.  When I first viewed the menu online, I was floored and so excited.  A lot of the options sounded just down right amazing and right up my alley.We got there around 11:30am on a Saturday (2nd day of opening) and there was a short wait of 20 mins (we were quoted 1hr).  The space is hip upscale diner, booths were large and spacious.  I blame the subpar food and really slow service to 2nd day of opening.  It took about 45 mins to get our food and it all came out at once, really wish my salad was brought out before my main entree.  I had the fried chicken which was over fried and over salted/seasoned.  The mac and cheese was really disappointing, kind of oily and seemed like it had been sitting around for a while and reheated.  My caesar was not fresh, overdressed and again had been sitting around dressed.  The croutons were a let-down.  Friends had some breakfast items which they felt were just okay, I didn't taste.  I unfortunately didn't go for my gut feeling and should have just got the hell outta there at this point, but I am an optimist, really wanted to try some dessert.  The pecan-pie cookie item with a side of ice cream was really ho-hum.  I expected the dessert to be heated up at least, but it was just a so-so baked cookie with a scoop of ice cream.  I believe it was $8?Love Stephanie Izard and all she stands for.  Just didn't love the diner."
"Went here last night with friends, the service was sub-par. I expected much more since it's from G&G. The food however was delicious - we shared the mac & cheese, which was delightful. I had the Pork Belly Sandwich - so delicious."
"Awww...Little Goat. I like it here.  I like the ""give us your phone number and we'll text you when your table is ready""...I liked the big roomy booth with the distressed leather...I loved the menu.  We asked our waitress what her favorites were and she gave us some amazing choices - the french toast, the goat chili, the choco taco sundae.  We ended up starting with the goat chili cheese fries which were delicious.  Large serving that was plenty for 3 to share.  Then our meals arrived.  I had the reuben, one friend had the patty melt and the other had the burger.  I loved mine...loved the beef prepared in house pastrami style and the kimchi kick which made it a little different.  The patty melt was a thumbs up as well (especially for the added pickle slices).  The burger was a thumb sideways.  It was good but nothing special.  Then we shared the cookie pie which was really delicious too.  It actually was like a chocolate chip cookie in a pie crust with ice cream on top.I also loved all the little personalized touches that they've used...ie the Little Goat Coffee mugs.  I love seeing the picture of that little goat everywhere.   Overall fun and delicious dining experience...want to come back and try that French Toast!"
"We went here for dinner the other night, we had been wanting to try this place for awhile. The food was really good. We started off with the crab dip with Ritz crackers-SO GOOD. The disappointing app was the fried pickles/onion rings. People, tempura does not make a good batter for everything. Hated these. Didn't even finish them. The entrees we had were the chicken sandwich and the pork tenderloin which had this great Asian sauce and slaw on it. My daughter (3) got a generous portion of fries and chicken strips. My husband ordered a Bloody Mary but thought it was too sweet-not sure what they put in it, but I don't drink these so I didn't try it. Then for dessert, we have the kid's ice cream sundae which we all shared. Overall, we thought it was a bit pricey, but very good, and family-friendly, which is important to us. We will come back and try more things. Maybe breakfast next time!"
"My favorite brunch spot in Chicago by far. This place is amazing. I ordered the Brandade and Belly 'Benedict', which was a mix of the most amazing flavors. The pork belly was extra tender and juicy, the biscuit was light and fluffy, and the kimchi gave the dish a nice kick. My friend and I also shared the mashed potato tempura. I was a little hesitant at first because I thought it would be a heavy dish, but the tempura was so light and almost had a floral aftertaste to it. Like I said, amazing!"
"Stephanie done did it again!  You go girl!!!  This place is A to the M to the A to the Z....to the ING!!!!  It's well worth the wait - because yeah, you're going to have to wait an average of 1 hour.  The menu is soooo delicious - it's not the healthiest since it's more of a diner place.  Their meats and produce are all locally produced by nearby farms - Slagel Farms is their big supplier - which is AWESOME!  Happy cows = happy me.  Their coffee is some Portland roasters - also very sustainable/organic, etc. but not too tasty (very dark roast, like sbux, but some might like that) - I'm a diehard fan of Intelligentsia, sigh.  I got the kimchi egg bacon asian thingy dish - it came with a crepe and a tangy sauce to dip the ""thingy"" in, some sprinkled scallions and it was just a mushy goodness.  I LOVED IT.  But you must love kimchi for you to like this dish - it's a korean marinated cabbage.  My husband got an all american burger - happy cow, with some veggies - he said it melted in his mouth ( Oh and it reminded him of In&Out burger in Cali - SOLD!).  We also got the fried pickles/onions appetizer - a MUST when you dine there.  And also smokey fries - meh, I don't know if we were just super full or the fries were just not anything super special or maybe our expectations were SO unbelievably high by the time fries came...not sure.  They have freshly squeezed juices - loved grapefruit juice.  We also ordered little goat drink - which is basically goat milk, some whipped cream and I think it has some chocolate syrup there...it's DELICIOUS and also a MUST.  The adjacent bakery (Little Goat Bread) makes gluten free muffins and are about to start baking gluten free bread!!!!  I was sooooo excited that I couldn't shut up talking about how gluten free is awesome, blah blah, the girl behind the register must've thought i was nutzo.  :) Anyways, the staff is amazing.  We met the manager of the restaurant, James, super nice chap, would love to chat with him again about all the adventures of the Boka Group and Stephanie.  The staff in general are very very nice and super helpful in advising on the menu because it's sort of large and overwhelming.Again, totally worth the wait!!!!  You can put your name on the list and go across the street and bit more south to La Columbia coffee shop and spend an hour there - it's a nice little shop. Rock on and please try the goatie goat!!! :) cheers!"
"Diner, meet gourmet chef!  Great concept, friendly service and fantastic food!  Tried the goat chili which was suprprisingly good!  Followed it with the Los Drowned sandwich.  It was a flavorful mix of perfectly blended textures between the meat, peppers, avocado, bread and Au jus.  That said, the Korean Burger blew me away!  An amazing combination of flavors.  My previous experiences with goat meat had me expecting a dry and tough burger.  It was perfectly cooked and very juicy.  Also tried the farmers pie and would happily enjoy it as my meal.Finished with the bacon toffee shake.  While it was exactly what I expected, the combination of bacon, toffee, goat mil pk and pork ice cream was just a bit too much for me.  Glad I tried it, but won't repeat that one!I can't wait to come back and try more on the menu!"
Really good variety of food and it all tasted delicious. Service was all great...no complaints!
"Place is a solid 4.  Good but not great bloody mary (three aces is my pinnacle of a good Bloody).  GREAT cinnabun!  They get points for creativity.  They have a spaghetti and clams, prepared in a carbonara style that looked good, but I went with the Asian breakfast.  Open face sandwich with eggs, bacon, and kimchi.  Again, good but not great.  This item was probably only a three star.Our waiter was fantastic.  Really great actually.I'd go back to try the next item on the menu!"
"Gorgeous restaurant and extremely friendly and smiley staff.This review is for breakfast.We got::Parathas Burrito: really great. However, it did not taste like breakfast food, which personally I do not mind but I know some do.  It also was not exactly a burrito.  It was an indian bread folded over with eggs and cheese on the inside and topped with a salad.  I also wish it had more of the orange sauce that was provided. I would recommend this for lunch even since they serve breakfast all day.  Biscuits and Gravy: Least favorite dish by far. My date and I are huge fans of biscuits and gravy, but we decided to just get a small plate of it to try because the mushroom sauce did not sound appealing.  After trying it, we both agreed that we were glad that we did not choose that as our main plate. It had a very odd flavor.  We asked the server what was the spice in it and she told us masala and cinnamon.  We did not finish even the one biscuit that was served. The Hungry Goat (hashbrowns, eggs, pork belly, 2 pancakes): My date said that he enjoyed it all.  He finished it all except for the pancakes.   It really was a lot of food. Toast: We asked for white toast and was given sour dough.  Very good! I would recommend anyone getting breakfast ask for a side of sour dough toast.Saw a girl with a bloody mary after we ate, but it was not on the menu. Disappointed because I would have ordered one! Downsides to the restaurant: no reservations and pretty expensive for breakfast.  Hard area to find street parking. Valet is available though."
"Saturday visit.  Great open vibe with no snobby wait staff.  If you can't get seating just walk over to the bar and eye seats like a hawk.  We got great bar seats and started with the shrimp cocktail (which was Delish).  Bartenders are knowledgable and offer fantastic service.  We ordered the pork belly sandwich and sloppy goat which should become staple items to get here.  I could smash 10-12 of those sandwiches...but that's because I always eat until I hate myself.Overall fantastic experience, great service, and decent price (at least compared to girl and the goat).  Must eat!"
"The Los Drowned sandwich reminded me of a love child between an Italian beef sandwich and pot roast. My wife made a bunch of mmmmmm sounds while eating the Fat Elvis waffles so I know it must've been good. This restaurant definitely deserves a 5 star rating for its service and food quality but the price point seemed a bit high. In my humble opinion, a restaurant self described as being a diner shouldn't charge high end sit down restaurant prices. But then again, with an average of 45 minute waiting list, they probably need to charge more to keep the hipsters away."
"I love this place.  They have my favorite salad in Chicago - the kale and chickpea salad.  It's so much more than what it sounds like from the description.  The ""chickpeas"" are actually in the form of round chickpea fritters that come with their own tsaziki sauce in addition to the dressing.  So good.  I also love the banana chocolate mini-pie they make.  Yum!"
"I'm sure their food is great, however, twice I've shown up to eat within their posted hours, and twice I've been turned away, the last time being nearly an hour before the time I was told over the phone that the kitchen would close.  I understand wanting to close up, but don't post hours you don't intend to keep...  I guess my business wasn't good enough for them..."
We came in for breakfast. The food was decent. Nothing special. The waitress forgot about us so we had to wait for over 30 minutes before we get to order.
"Like boisterous atmosphere and food that makes love to your face? Shut up and get to The Goat (little, Big is good too though)"
It was a perfect Tuesday afternoon in Chicago - fall temperatures and the sun was shining... little goat put the cherry on top of our perfect day.  Our server Sean was very knowledgeable and friendly - he guided us through our over eating exhibition perfectly.  The home made hot dog wrapped in pancake and egg was the perfect combination of savory and sweet - home made corned beef !!!!  nacho's - those chips were awesome.  this is a place i'll go back to - its classic and funky but so welcoming.
"You will not be disappointed with the food!  Everything is great, creative and flavorful.  I much prefer breakfast there but their diner menu of sammiches isn't bad.  You will need to be adventurous though...they use lots of non-traditional meats and cheeses.  So far my hands  down favorite is the Bull's Eye French Toast.  The pasta and clams is also a good one.  I wouldn't write home about the Rueben but could see how someone else might love it.  The smoked fries saved the day for me.I wish they would do a better job with cleaning glasses and plates.  I visited 3 times and during two visits I've had to request clean dishes which I get quickly.  That's a turn off but may be due to the sheer volume of people in an out."
"I went here for lunch with a few friends earlier this week.  I had heard that Little goat was diner style so I was actually expecting it to look more drab and old school (you know..like your usual diner establishment) and it was actually very nice and open.  Little goat has high ceilings and big windows to take full advantage of the natural light coming in and they make great use of the space to add as many tables and counter space as they can, but yet it doesn't make the space feel too clustered.  Also we went a little after 12:30 and the wait was not bad at all, we only waited for about ten minutes..which seemed like a mini miracle.  I ordered the little goat latte...which wasn't bad, it was interesting, but it really made you feel like you should be smearing your drink on a cracker and eating it, rather than drinking it like a latte.  I ordered the shrimp and grits as my main entree and we shared a side of fries for the table.  I loved my shrimp and grits, full of flavor and richness and they give you a decent portion of shrimp for $12!  My other friends ordered the reuben, the breakfast burrito and the fried pickle sandwich.  Each order was as decadent and rich as they sounded and delicious!  I think my only complaint was that my stomach hurt a little from all of the rich food I consumed over lunch.I thought the prices were very reasonable for what we got and I am definitely looking forward to coming back here again.  I just hope I can hold myself back from overeating!"
"Yes the food is great.  But I want to be real here.  I ordered a $13 Reuben, it was damn good, but not big at all.$13.  No side, fries, slaw, nothing.  That's without tax and gratuity; I mean let's be honest.  Was it delicious? Yes.  $13 delicious? No.  Though to be fair, it is a very popular place with a well-known name so it was expected.  However, their malt chocolate shake was really solid."
"We checked out LG on two occasions for brunch.  The first time we were lucky enough to be meeting friends that live nearby so they went around 10am and put down our name.  It was supposed to be a one hour and 45 min wait and it turned out to be less than an hour.  We didn't mind because we able to relax at their house while drinking cocktails.  The second time we went we were up early and decided to go around 8:30-9am.  That is a good time to go - no wait.  By around 9:30am it started to get packed and we noticed a line.  The food was fabulous and I feel that the prices are comparable based on the quality of food.  I had the apple pancakes and they are just to die for.  I am actually craving them right now.  On my second trip, I had the pork belly benedict and it was good but not great.  I wouldn't die to go back there for that.  i would go back to try out the lunch and dinner options.  Some people were having burgers and they looked good.We walked through the bakery/sandwich shop and it looks like a good vibe. Def check it out!  If you don't like waits and want brunch - go before 9am!"
"In the loop on my bike, need food.  Thank you Little Goat.  Best sandwich I've had in a long time and I like my sammies!Personally I went with the braised beef.  I figured that I could burn off the calories since spring is starting to peek out in Chicago and I can bike instead of CTA.  Great choice.  Dripping with delicious beef juice and some avocado to help me feel healthy.  Next time I going to try that grilled cheese though.  My lunch date had it and it looked like simple eating pleasure."
"I would give the food 5 stars, everything we ordered was amazing. Beef sandwich, spanish omelette and the smoked fried which were all recommended by our server. And were delicious. Service was average a little slow at times. The reason I am giving this place 3 stars and not 5 is because of the wait. It's crazy! Their waiting area is way to small so you have to wait outside which is not very good especially when it is like 10 degrees outside. Our wait was about 1 hour and 45 minutes. Unless you have loads of time to kill on a Sunday you probably should avoid. This place is really close to where I live but the wait is a killer."
"We visited on a Saturday night for my birthday.  Oh my goodness, was it packed.  The wait was over an hour but damn, it was worth it.  We started with the crisp shrimp cocktail.  So yummy.  The shrimp was large and flavorful.  Definitely would order that again!  My husband ordered the farmer's pie and me, being the 11 year old that I am, I ordered the fat club with a side of garlic mashed potatoes.  Best club sandwich of my life!!!!!!!  It's towering, stocked with yummy meat and fresh veggies.  And the fat toast?!  Amazing!!  I loved the mashed potatoes too.  I ordered it without gravy, but it came to our table with gravy on it.  Our waitress came by and asked if I wanted her to send it back but I said no, that I liked it with the gravy actually.  My husband enjoyed his entree as well, cleaning the entire bowl.  We ordered the apple pie for dessert.  It was a cute little round pie.  The crust was great, not heavy at all.  The apple was not overly sweet.  Very well done.  I loved this birthday meal.  I can't wait to visit little goat again.  With everyone I know, of course!"
"Had a great brunch with a party of 5. Sat at one of the communal high tops and the service was phenomenal - the waiter even split the check on request, a Chicago rarity!"
"Sooo...a friend and I went here on Friday night. It's a tad confusing because the diner is connected to a Little Goat Bread (I think) which also has a bar at night and coffee and sandwiches during the day, as well as a separate menu. I still don't totally get it. But anyway, we walked into the bar and there were no seats available at the bar. So, we were told to see the hostess in the diner about getting a table. I asked if it was the same menu and she said yes, I think. But it turned out that the bar area next door (Little Goat Bread) has a day menu consisting of sandwiches that is unavailable at the diner (according to our waiter). Regardless, we were able to get drinks at our table in the diner. We also tried the crab dip with Ritz crackers. That was a little disappointing because even though it tasted like crab, it contained no visible crab pieces. For me, it was too creamy and smooth and there was too much of it to finish, even for two. The entrees were pretty interesting and ranged from some pretty standard sounding breakfast fare (served all day!) and other entrees. The mac and cheese looked good but we didn't get that side. We both ordered the whitefish tostadas, which were really excellent. You get three of them, with very big pieces of firm, grilled (or maybe baked) fish, atop crispy tostadas which I am sure are not good for you, but were really tasty. The seasoning was perfect with harissa adding a kiss of heat. We didn't try dessert but it looked like they have some fun choices, including milkshakes, with a heavy emphasis on chocolate. The service is laid back, not super attentive, but fine. The crowd in the diner is pretty diverse, with a number of kids early on. The bar is nice and dark and was even more crowded later."
"Super cute, super yummy and super friendly.A friend and I have made a habit of heading to early lunches to avoid crowds, and it definitely paid off at Little Goat.  We arrived at 11:05 and were immediately whisked to the last open booth for two.  Score!Service was attentive and relaxed.  Our server, Allison, was friendly and knowledgeable about most of the menu, offering suggestions for both breakfast (served all day) and lunch items.  My friend finally settled on the pork belly pancake and I opted for the fish tostadas with a butternut squash soup to start.The soup was creamy and hot and delicious.  It even had little pumpkin seeds and a lovely garnish of heavy cream!  My fish tostadas were equally yummy.  The fish was cooked well, topped with a light cabbage slaw that had just enough zing and the tostadas were crispy-crunchy and never lost their texture.My friend's pork belly pancake combined the best of bacon with a savory scallion pancake and seemed to bring out the best in both of them.  I can see why this is a popular dish.The food was so good we opted to split dessert: a ""baby"" blood orange meringue pie.  Wow!  Think ""creamsicle"" without all the nasty chemicals.  This was fresh, bright, gorgeous fruit concentrated into a pudding and poured over a crumbly, buttery crust.  The meringue was hands down the best I've ever tasted - stick-to-your-lips gooey with a simple, elegant flavor.By the middle of the meal, we were already strategizing when to bring a larger group, and by the time we left, we decided even if it's crowded, Little Goat is worth the wait for a return trip."
I actually loved this place! Been here 3 times but was only disappointed once with the dish I had but everyone else's food was fine
"What a disappointment...everything we had. The Bloody Mary tasted like there was metal or medicine in it. I had the Goat Burger and it was aweful. The BBQ pork and braised beef on the burger were good, but the burger itself was gross. The meat, sauce and fried veggies...ick. Huge waste of $20 bucks on one burger. The tuna melt was fishy and mushy. The chilie cheese fries were just ok. The waitress was good, but did not ask us what was wrong when we asked for the bill with our food barly being touched and we both blurted out No!, when asked for to go bags. Maybe we just ordered the wrong things, yet the waitress did recommend the overprice garbage burger. I have heard good things about the fried chicken, but they were sold out if it at 9am. We'll stick with The Girl and the Goat from now on. It's worth the wait and cost."
"A year later we were back in Chicago and, yes, back to Little Goat Diner. This time we sat inside because of cooler weather. Still great food and friendly service. This time I had the fried chicken entree one day and the chicken sandwich another day. This place has quality food for reasonable prices. Love it."
"Friend suggested we go eat there for dinner. I had been to Girl and the Goat a few times, but didn't know what to expect from Little Goat. We had a 30 minute wait, which wasn't a problem because they had a bar and a coffee bar. I had their Hoopoe's Hope which had Gin, Mathilde Peche Cocchi Vermouth, and Fresh Lemon Juice. It was very very tasty. The bartender was very helpful and despite him being busy took very good care of me and my friends. Instead of a pager they will text you when you are ready. The menu had a lot of twists to what regular diner food would be. I decided to try the Fried Pickles and Onion Rings with curry mayo as well as the Crispy Shrimp Cocktail romen noodle wrapped shrimp served over lettuce wraps that you are supposed to use to eat the shrimp with. The Onion rings pretty much tasted like fried pickles because the onions were fried with the pickles. The battery was very light and over all tasty. The Shrimp was a little different. I personally think there were to many noodles wrapped around the shrimp because on the outside the noodles were perfectly crisp but the ones on the inside were a little soggy. For dinner I had sunfish which had sautéed sunfish, braised goat, over a warm veggie salad drizzled with goat's milk caramel. I had never had sunfish and was curious to try it. It was a light ok fish. The braised goat was obviously the winner of the medley of food in that dish. My friends had the fried chicken which has 1/2 Walter's chicken (a local farmer), with  mashed potato and slaw salad. The breading on the chicken was nice and when my friends asked for hot sauce they served to home made sauces which were very very tasty. We wished they sold the sauce in their shop. the mashed potato and slaw... Those are hard because everyone has their own taste. I am not a mashed potato fan so I can't comment on them, but my friends thought they were ok. The slaw lacked a lot of dressing. Maybe this is what Little Goat was going for, but we all found it to be dry. Overall dinner was acceptable. Waiter and staff was very helpful and friendly. After looking over the menu I think I would really enjoy having brunch there more. I am really glad I tried it. I think just because of all the other choices right there it might be hard for me to pick Little Goat again for dinner."
The website said they are open until 3 today.  We arrived at 2:04 after an hour long bus ride. They stopped seating at 2.  The website said nothing about it. I asked the hostess if they could please seat us a my friend is from VA.  Nope.  Bullshit.  Heard good things but I can't try it due to bullshit. Won't go back either.
"5 stars for the combination of atmosphere and food - 4 stars for the food- expect to wait we waited close to 2 hours - Interesting mix of Food Network loving, saggy jeans tourists, hipsters and families.  Food is creative and a lot to choose from, vibe is vibrant the design puts a modem spin on 70s Diner design with that is bright, energetic and loud.  Wait staff is well-trained and food has enough creative spins to keep you coming back to try more"
"Little goat leaves me a bit perplexed as to what they want to be.  The decor, foodand mobs of people scream ""super trendy hot spot"" but the uniforms, menu blue plate specials and friendliness say ""local, casual hometown diner"".After getting quoted an hour+ and the big sister restaurant across the street, we ventured over to doesn't-take-reservation land and were fairly quickly seated at the bar.  -Toffee bacon milkshake- smoky, creamy salty, buttery decadence.  Hits all 4 food groups, right?- Bullseye French toast- thick Texas toast with a hole cut out middle and replaced with an egg ad oozes out when you cut into it.  Really good (but not for those that like separation of church and state of sweet and savory).  The sliced chicken tenders were dry and overcooked on top.- Smoky fries not my fav, they are the skinny cut kind.  I prefer and more robust structure to carry the ketchup.- The staff gave us an order of fried pickles and onion rings.  I really appreciated the gesture, but unfortunately this dish was not good.  Way way too much tempura batter for a paper thin slice of pickle.-Service was superb and everyone was super nice.  I even bought the $13.95 mug because I think the goat is cute."
"Nice place and good food. The service could use some work, however."
"After a fabulous evening at Girl & the Goat, we decided we hadn't had enough.  Not 10 hours later, we braved a brisk, chilly, rainy walk to Little Goat.  Luckily, no line or wait before 8AM -- just a handful of tables from what I could see.Like Girl & The Goat, you could confidently pick just about anything off the menu.  We immediately bonded with our waiter, who came quickly with offerings of double shot caffeination to suit just about any coffee lover's taste.  I don't usually handle dairy very well and was pleasantly surprised at the proactive suggestion of soy, rice, or almond milk to go with my just brewed super strong coffee.  Now how often do you get three other choices let alone one?Since we clearly were stumped for our breakfast orders, again, it was waitstaff to the rescue.  Two simple questions: Sweet or savory?  Any special diets?  Answers: One sweet & savory, two savories.  No pork, no dairy.  Without hesitation, he recommended:- Bull's Eye French Toast- Chicken Enchilada special- Kimchee, Bacon, Eggs, Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing (no joke, that's what it is called)- Side of hash browns with goat cheeseIt is important to note all sides are extra.  I somehow missed the Mac N' Cheese (gasp!) option.  Something I shall have to remedy in the future, perhaps paired with the Kilgus Goat, Loco Moco style.I've developed an affinity for kimchee over the last few years -- basically the 'breakfast tasty thing' (which is the only way you can describe it when it arrives at the table) had everything I wanted for breakfast.  Combined with hash browns and a delectable mango habanero sauce, it was comfort food to the Nth degree.The only issue was we simply couldn't eat all of it.  We stuffed ourselves silly but were spoiled with the smaller Girl & The Goat portions.  No way we could overcome the more generous, but by no means less sumptuous, diner fare.I do recommend trying to conquer the mix 'n match menu.  A semi-serious attempt, at almost any time of the day or night, will do ya."
"Little Goat makes me want to write poetry.I'm already a huge fan of Girl & the Goat (Stephanie Izard might be my spirit animal), so I had high expectations for Little Goat. It continues to meet them.I could come here 30 times and still not eat everything I want to try on the menu. Alas, I've only been twice but intend to keep coming back. The key to not waiting a long time seems to be getting up early (we got in at 8AM on Sunday with no wait) or eating at odd times (4:30 dinner, anyone?). No shame in that game. Good food is good food.TRY: Fat Elvis waffles, Hot Crab dip, Machos Nachos."
"I came here this morning to do a little work before I had to head to the office. I was greeted by a very friendly gentleman at the door who sat me very quickly. I was the annoying person clacking away on her computer while trying to eat breakfast but everyone was so nice. I had 2 poached eggs, bacon (delicious!!!), and a fruit bowl. Brian was my server and he was great! Attentive but not all up in my business. Such a cute diner atmosphere. And can I say I LOVE the oldy-timey waitress diner dresses?!?!"
"It's always worth the wait!!...One of my favorite places to go for brunch (especially after a night out!). Love the old diner atmosphere and hanging out in the bar/coffee shop while waiting for a table. The food never disappoints and you definitely won't leave hungry. Favorites: Cheesy garlic bread with marinara melts in your mouth, sloppy goat, and Los drowned is massive but full of flavors I can't describe. 4 stars because the service is subpar."
"Omg. What the f Stephanie?  You freakin rock!!!  Went w my husband and 22 month old on the coldest day in Chicago. Along w the rest of the world. We waited 25 min ish in the bar area at little bread. I kept neurotically refreshing my ""no wait"" app to see how many people were in line in front of us. What a great new tool. We sat in a communal table with a couple other parties. I was worried how they'd react to my daughter who tends to throw food sometimes. But they were receptive. My daughter just stared. Red hair and facial hair keep her interested for a while. I sleekly glance at their half eaten food as I'm trying to decide between the egg, pancake, kimchi Asian breakfast or the breakfast spaghetti w clams. The apple pancakes and hash browns next to us do appeal to us (me, really). We order both the Asian breakfast and breakfast spaghetti for ourselves. We also get hash browns w goat cheese and the apple pancakes ""for my daughter"". Everything was delicious. I saved half of my savory dish for home. There were thick chunks of bacon. The pancakes and eggs mixed together w the crunchy bites of kimchi. It came w a vinegar sauce on the side, which I used sparingly. The tartness and acidity cut the richness if the dish. Like the dipping sauce to a potsticker. Or simple distilled vinegar and garlic to longanisa. Mmmm. The hubs spaghetti was coated in egg w fresh clams. Very rich. Very unlike a usual breakfast. Unless you ate a Filipino house (where sometimes last nights left over chicken adobo sauce gets blended in a fried rice w an egg on top). The hash browns were the usual geared potato browned on a skillet but w a creamy goat cheese treat melting inside of it. I grew up on goat and it kinda scarred me. That pungent uric acid aroma that rises in the back if your pallet as you exhale turns me off. I overheard the party next to us rave the hash browns. Saying ""so creamy but the goat cheese is undetectable and subtle"". WRONG. It was delicious if you like goat cheese. But not as subtle to me. The hubs did love it. And the girls in the party next to us must have had stuffy noses. The apple spiced pancakes were also delicious. With an oatmeal crumble and cream cheese atop. A nice sweet ending to our savory meal. Maybe I was a little star struck by Stephanie Izzard working in the kitchen. I had an impulse to run to the counter and snap a pic. There was a family there w one of their big DSLR cams snapping picks of EVERYTHING. from the baristas to the books on sale.  But I didn't want to be like all the other Asians snapping pics of their food and posting it on Facebook.I enjoyed the atmosphere. Communal tables. A lot of natural light. There was a great buzz about the place. I would definitely go back for dinner."
"If you live in the West Loop area I would stop by and try this great New Dinner. I have eaten there twice and the food is amazing. The sandwiches there are so tasty, they are big so you will definantly have lunch tomorrow. If I lived closer I would eat here so much more, and most likely be 20 pounds heavier. Dont forget the biscuits or mac and cheese with your sides."
"Okay, so I finally made it into the Little Goat for a late lunch. A friend and I decided to come her and it sadly it's not super easy to get to via public trans, but we made it there nonetheless. There was a 75-90 minute wait at 3pm on a Sunday. I suppose it is a Sunday, but that's quite a long wait for mid afternoon to  me. I guess that's what happens when you go to a Stephanie Izard restaurant (Girl and the Goat tends to be hard to get reservations for unless you schedule way out).After pleasantly waiting for our table at a coffee shop down the street, we were notified via text (wonderful feature) that our table was ready after only 50 minutes (be careful not to go to far as it took us about 5-7 minutes to walk back and our table was given to another group... but I didn't feel that bad about that).Our waitress was a lovely girl who gave us some great recommendations. I decided to order the Bull's Eye French Toast. It was stellar! An egg is baked into the middle of each piece of french toast which is perfect for dipping the crispy fried chicken that comes with these waffles. The onion brioche paired with the barbecue maple syrup made the flavor of this dish extra special. This definitely will not be the last time I order Bull's Eye French Toast!I decided to get a side of goat cheese hash browns. Though I love goat cheese and hash browns, these are nothing special, but since they are a side dish I wasn't totally expecting to be wowed. My friend decided on the grilled cheese which was a surprisingly huge sandwich and not what you expect in a grilled cheese. I didn't get a chance to taste it but he seemed to enjoy it. I did however, snag several of his smoked fries. Like our waiter said, there isn't really a smokey flavor to these so don't be turned away by the ""smoked"" name.I will definitely be making the hike back here. It's totally worth it!"
"Little Goat Diner is my newest love in Chicago. It's all the commitment to flavor and distinctive ingredients of Girl and the Goat channeled into diner food. Open from 7 am until 2 am, I can't wait to go here when I'm near the loop and in desperate need of food late. I've also yet to try breakfast here, so eagerly looking forward to that as well. Will update this as it happens.The look inside is contemporary yet the ambiance is extremely casual and lively. The servers are dressed in classic diner apparel and extremely friendly and helpful. The first time I went we got shorted on the fried pickles part of the fried pickles and onion rings and our server got us more. They are really helpful with all menu questions too.The food is greasy diner bliss with fresh ingredients snuck inside. The perfect example is the Los Drowned, which is like a French Dip (served with a side of jus) but with purple onions and what looks like a pickle slaw of sorts. I've also had the patty melt with a goat patty and you can barely tell you're not eating beef because its smothered in excellence. The portions are large and worth the price, even a la carte. You won't want to save your money when you come here anyway because it all sounds so good. You'll be looking left and right wondering what your neighbors are eating.For sides/appetizers, the fried pickles and onion rings were disappointed, but the hash browns with goat cheese and the smoke fries (they smoke them for hours -- fries!) are delicious. I've yet to try dessert, but the milkshakes look heavenly.Unlike most diners, you can also order, wine, beer or mixed drinks -- in addition to house-made sodas and coffee, etc. I was really worried that the menu would be small, but Stephanie Izard has clearly made an effort to bring her food vision to as wide an audience as possible. This place is even family friendly, if you are looking not to compromise great food just to satisfy your child companions.I haven't been at all times of day yet, but I imagine it's crowded around the clock. Fortunately, I got in with no wait at the counter around 8 pm on a Thursday night and with five minutes wait on a Sunday around 5:30 pm.A lot of Little Goat is built on hype and Stephanie's reputation, but it's definitely a superior dining experience worth a journey to the West Loop."
"It is an overpriced diner. The elvis waffles are good, if they have it. So is the crab dip, but it is kinda rich. Nothing blew me away though. Again, like girl & the goat, this is overhyped over priced food. Kind of like the rest of the west loop."
I have been hoping to get to this spot for a while since I am a huge fan of the Girl and the Goat.  We just walked in off the street without a wait after going to the Randolph St. Fest last weekend.  I ordered the fish tostadas and my sister ordered the french toast with an egg in the middle and crispy chicken on top.  The food was very good and an interesting twist on the average diner food.
"I was really underwhelmed.  Really.I'm trying to think back to the last ""meh"" omelette I've had and I can't remember, because in general, I think all omelettes are fantastic.  However, I actually thought the Spanish Omelette here was almost gross.  It's about a foot long of peppers and eggs.  If you don't like peppers, don't bother, it's all egg and pepper.  Then on top they  added Dorrito tasting chips which were probably the best part, with what looked like a can of stewed tomatoes.  The home fries were nothing special either.Disappointing."
"I went to Little Goat about a week ago and had a great time.  The weather was clear but just a bit on the cool side, and this allowed us to get immediate outdoor seating.  I ordered the Goat Almighty burger and was completely floored with the sheer size of the thing.  The toppings and bun are loosely stacked, centered over the burger with the help of a wooden skewer.  The resulting assembly is easily eight inches tall.  And damn, is it good.I squeezed the burger down to a manageable thickness and began eating.  As I shamelessly devoured the burger, my higher brain functions slowly shut down and my eyes glazed over with a Neanderthal bliss.  The taste of beef, pork, onion rings, and a medley of other complex flavors were intoxicating and completely overwhelming to my lizard brain.  But I didn't care.  In the span of thirty-seconds I had gone from a college-educated professional to a knuckle-dragging caveman whose sole purpose in life was to devour the next 300-calorie mouthful of orgasmaburger.  Had the hostess not intervened asking we'd like more water or another beer, my brain might have been permanently locked in the early paleolithic era.  But it would have been totally worth it."
"The food was tasty, as were the drinks.  However, later on a Friday, it was super crowded, and we did not receive much attention."
"I don't even know where to begin.  Picture yourself in a car, and out of nowhere you're blind-sided.  By definition, you didn't see it coming.  That's how I felt about this place on bite numero uno.  Sure, it is on short lists for being one of the best eats in the city, but to me it was a place to grab a bite on a Sunday.  Hey, I'm still new to the city.  Okay, on with the review...After waiting about 35 minutes we were seated.  It was a gorgeous day, we were hoping for outside seats, but we opted for first available.  No worries though, the indoor seating is prime for people watching, getting a feel for the spot-on diner atmosphere and basking in the sunlight from the enormous skylight in the center of the ceiling.  We were greeted by a waitress that knew her stuff, smiled because she wanted to and wasn't afraid to help with the menu.  Speaking of, this menu is not just a list of food they serve; it is a reflection of the genius behind that cunning little goat, Stephanie Izard.  You can see the passion for great food and how it makes for a superb experience.  Locally sourced meats, eggs and veggies, Stumptown coffee and the perfect blend of ingredients in the dishes that would make you think Walter White retired and started working here.  After much deliberation and friendly advice from the waitress we decided on the Apple Cinnamon pancakes, Fate Elvis Waffles, Big Fork Maple Sausage and a cup of coffee.  So how did it all taste?  Insert expletives here.How can I rave about waffles?  We've all had waffles, right?  No biggie.  Oh, how wrong we can be.  These were the best waffles I have ever eaten.  I'm crying right now just thinking about them.  The Fat Elvis Waffles consist of two large rectangular waffles covered in sliced banana, peanut butter butter and maple syrup with crumbled bacon pieces.  Take your time; try not to hyperventilate.  This dish was an experience.  I was a little weary about the peanut butter butter, since PB can be so over powering, but this was how it should be.  Every flavor popped, made me contemplate how lucky I was to be eating it, and then slapped me in the face to take another bite.  Pure perfection.  Oh, here comes the sausage.  It wasn't brought out the same time as the main dish, most likely because it was being blessed by the Lord himself.  It was that fantastic.  Do yourself a favor and go to Big Fork's website to read about their products, you'll get a feeling of just how good this stuff is.  I love my meat, so having meat from animals that were cared for under a higher level of ethics says and means a lot.  You taste a difference trust me.  Lastly, we get to the pancakes.  The dough is made from a sour dough base, so they aren't overly sweet...good thing, the apples are fresh, large slices mixed right in the batter...another good thing and they are light and fluffy almost becoming one with your taste buds...yep, you guessed it.  Take all these flavors and mix in coffee from one of the best providers in the country and you have an experience worth five stars.  This place is pure culinary bliss.  Go, eat, experience.  Noteworthy Points:Accepts cardsStreet parkingServes alcoholGreat service"
"I love Little Goat! We visited on a Sunday morning around 11am and waited between 20-30 minutes (not bad for a Sunday breakfast in Chicago!) We were seated outside, which was great because it was beautiful out. We took forever to order/eat, which I felt a little bad about because I know waitstaff like to move tables quickly, but our waitress didn't seem to mind at all, she was absolutely great! The food was also delicious, as always! I have loved seriously everything I've tried here (favorite thusfar has been Los Drowned--oh. my. God.) The reason I dropped it to 4 stars was because I ordered a couple eggs over-medium, had to send them back (which I pretty much never do) for being incredibly runny, I mean like egg-white runny, yet when they came back the yokes were still completely runny.. So unfortunately I had to send them back again, and the third time they came out pretty much well-done. I get it, they were probably annoyed with me sending them back so many times, but how hard is it to cook over-medium eggs? Sigh. Anyway, of course I'll go back because I absolutely love this place, but will probably skip the eggs next time."
In my Oprah voice:  This place is AMAZING!!!!  I'm going to try everything on the menu.
"I love good diner food and The Little Goat is probably the best execution of contemporary diner food with a gourmet twist I've ever experienced.I've been to this place twice, both time with friends. There is almost always a long wait if you go at lunch time so I recommend going for an early lunch (before 11:30 am) to keep the wait minimal.The service is very good. The first time I sat at the counter, which has stools right out of a 1950's diner. I tried the Spiced Apple Pancakes and there was enough food for two meals. So good and yummieeeeee!On my second visit, I tried an omelette and was bowled over. I am a person who loves breakfast foods for any meal, so this is a great restaurant option for me. But they do have sammiches, hot entrees and a wide range of typical lunch, dinner items (each with a Girl & the Goat flair).Probably best of all is the bakery they have next door, which now makes all the breads for Little Goat and Girl & The Goat. I took two loaves of sun-dried tomato bread home.The atmosphere is lively and sometimes loud, but even when they are at the height of their business, the service is fast. Both times my party got out in less than 60 minutes (after we were seated) and never felt rushed."
"Delicious pulled pork sandwich on a huge, buttery bun.  The ""cole slaw"" and pickled red onions were all mixed in with the pork, so it was a fun spin on an old favorite. The smoked fries were awesome but HUGE - would have been enough for four people to share.   And the Choco Taco dessert - sour cream gelato, pepitas and chocolate-dipped tortilla chips - yes, please!!We got a spot at the counter with no wait at 6:10 on a Monday night.  If I hadn't shown up 10 minutes late, we would have gotten a table to ourselves.  So if you want to sit at a non-communal table, get there before 6:05, because 5 minutes later there will be a 20 minute wait."
"Awesome upscale diner that is totally worth the hype and the wait. Definitely plan far ahead or opt for an early lunch if you don't want to spend the better part of 2 hours here, but honestly there are far worse fates. The bar/bakery in the back is a nice place to hang out while you wait for a table in the main area.The food is all great and very reasonable for the quantity and quality of what's available. Had a bit of the Nachos, Fat Elvis Waffle, Goat Chili and Hash Browns. All of it was incredible, a word that is probably thrown around too often on yelp, but I'm certain it's full meaning is appropriate here. Special shout out to the Hash Browns which seemed to have a sour cream (or maybe just cream?) infusion. Holy cow. Amazing.Find an excuse to come here. Just do it."
"Overpriced, pretentious, and we have been waiting since Thursday for a manager to call us back. There are dozens of other restaurants nearby, don't waste your time or your money."
"I want to give this 3.5 stars for the food and experience. I'm giving it four stars because there is a ton of work that goes into launching a restaurant and Stephanie has got to be working a ton of hours (she is always there!). Also 3.5 stars is not an option.After the Food Network and Yelp it's really hard to give your opinion on a restaurant without feeling like (an ass) you're just repeating something that's already been said, or simply over analyzing it. So I'll keep it brief.I had the shrimp and grits on my first visit. It was good, I'd order it again. Last weekend I had the ""Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing"". It was okay, I don't think I'd order it again. It had a good taste, but the texture of everything after a bit was, meh.The interior is very classy, while playing on the diner theme. It is a little obvious that the whole shebang is funded by the BRG Group. The waitstaff is friendly, as friendly as you can be when you have hundreds of people shuffling in on a weekend afternoon to flash their wide eyes and exclamations of ""Oh my god this is so good, I need to take a picture."" There are a few more places I want to venture to before heading back."
"For me, this place lives up to the hype.The service was great, our server was friendly, attentive, and gave great recommendations.  We sampled a little bit of everything (from the lunch/dinner side of things) and loved it all.We waited an hour for our table...but the bread shop is right next door and you can easily wait there as long as it's not too crowded.I will be back."
"YUM YUM YUM! Food was delish! I'd recommend going on a weekday night. We had no problem getting seated at 6 pm on a Wednesday. For starters, the nachos were amazing! I actually was trying to convince my friends to skip it because I thought it was silly to get nachos but they were delicious! There is something special about those chips. They are HUGE though. Us four girls shared it and I was honestly feeling full after. We then ordered three dishes to share and we could have done two. We got the bulls eye  french toast which the  french toast was DELICIOUS! but the chicken didn't go well with it. I am a huge fan of sweet and savory but it just didn't work for us. Then we got the lordes sammich which was tasty but wasn't in love with. Then lastly, the goat burger which is so crazy huge, we were so intimidated. We picked at the meat which was delicious, but it's impossible to eat as a burger. It's like 6 inches tall! Insane. Anyway, the service was great. We sat at the bar waiting for our friends and I got the first drink on the cocktail menu that tasted like cucumber and had vodka in it.. that was good. The decor is cute.. like a classy diner. I'd come back to try other dishes for sure. Excited to finally get reservations for Girl & the Goat for next month!!"
Fabulous joint! I enjoyed the pork belly pancake and my hubby got a pulled pork sammie. Great flavor combos. Also shared a side of smoked fries and tried the tempura fried mashed taters. All very tasty with Classic Izard twists and punches of flavor!!
"I guess I had high expectations going in, but I have to say my experience at lunch today left me a little disappointed.  The atmosphere was great, but we ended up squished between two sets of couples at a communal table.  I am new to the city, so I figured I would just go with the flow.  We ended up chatting with two other ladies, so I guess it worked out.  I only mention it because not every conversation is meant to be shared.  If you need some privacy, you may want to request a booth when you walk in.My friend and I both started with the Goat Chili.  It was delicious and bursting with flavor!  It would have been even better if it was served hot! It was a little on the cold side, and I even considered sending it back.  If it was a tad bit warmer, I would say it was the best chili I have ever had.  I guess that is why I couldn't be bothered with sending it back.I followed this up with the Grilled Cheese sandwich. I was so looking forward to it, but somehow it just missed the mark.  It was extremely salty, and it had loads of onions on it, which weren't mentioned on the menu.  I happen to love onions, just not necessarily on my grilled cheese sandwich.  I will definitely try the Little Goat again, but for now I have to give it three stars.  I think next time I will try breakfast..."
"Woo-hoo -- what a great diner! We sampled Little Goat for a weekday brunch and had a great time all around. The space is airy, light and upbeat. The staff is very well-trained (seems to be a hallmark of BRG Group restaurants -- good job!). Everyone was congenial as can be -- even the bussers made witty conversation!And the food was very good, indeed. My fave was Fat Elvis waffles with peanut butter butter and bacon maple syrup -- I am sure this is how The King wanted to be remembered. Running a close second was Dark Chocolate Chip Crunch pancakes with chocolate malt butter. If your idea of a great brunch is sweet indulgence, pick either of these two. We also had a Parathas Burrito, with egg, avocado and chili sauce, and it was delicious.I've heard there can be a wait to get into Little Goat for lunch and dinner, but we lucked out for brunch. I'm looking forward to returning -- I figure it'll take at least a dozen visits to sample the delights of just their morning menu..."
Cannot wait to go back. Will most likely wait a month so they can work out a couple of their kinks. Loved the blood orange meringue which I had to take home with me since I was so stuffed from my meal. Food and waitress was great expediting needs some work. I sat at the bar and could see my food sitting long enough for it to become cold and the sauce my breakfast was sitting in become grainy. The bottom of my boyfriends sandwich did become soaked from the juicy meat sitting in the window. Overall though we are looking forward to coming back and trying more of the menu. We are also big fan of the Girl and Goat and are glad we don't need reservations 2 months in advance to get in here.
"Ok,  tried this place yet again and only ordered some of the side vegetarian options like soup and root veggies and it was pretty good.  Maybe it's just the vegetarian meal options that aren't very good."
"Wow - just amazing. Everything I've had has been delicious. From a vegetarian perspective - the Spanish Omlette and Parabas Burrito are the best, but I definitely would recommend the Spanish Omlette if you like Chilequilles. And the cinnamon roll - TO DIE FOR. I think they put cream cheese frosting on it. It's better than Ann Sather's. There, I said it. Best advice - if you don't want to wait, get there before 8:45 AM  or around 4-5 PM on a Saturday or Sunday. On one of my trips, the wait was quoted as 2.5 hours for lunch (around 12 PM), but it ended up only being 1.5 hours. It was okay, we went to Glazed and Infused for an appetizer. :)"
"Such a nice experience.  It has a comfortable diner experience.  You can see the kitchen from the seated area.  Daily specials.  Access to a bread/baker/bar area (so fantastic).  Casual.  A little upscale.  Fast, fresh food and service.  Can't wait to go back."
"This review is for our brunch/lunch experience at Little Goat:We've now been to Little Goat numerous times, and each time our minds are blown by the excellent service, unique menu options and most importantly, the absolutely incredible, flavorful and creative food. Every single item we've tried was delicious. Even when there's been a wait, we've loved checking out Little Goat bread, sipping on their awesome specialty lattes and sampling a little bread. Our favorite items are...-parathas burrito: a must-try, especially if you like both 1.) breakfast burritos, AND 2.) Indian food. So unique and perfectly designed. Delicious.-Chick pea salad: one of the most amazing (healthier) options on the menu-Bulls Eye French Toast: Amazing how Stephanie could reinvent such a basic standard. The egg yolk inside the french toast was perfect, and the fried chicken is the cherry on top.-Tuna Melt: One of the more different tuna melts you'll try. Extremely rich, so we'd suggest sharing with  others so you can get a few bites before it gets old-Cornbeef Hash: Out of this world. Love their in-house hash-Brussel Sprouts: Surprisingly perfect side-Fish Tostadas: Great dish to share; not the best on the menu, but very solidStephanie, thanks for keeping us fat."
Service was 5 star but I wasn't really impressed with my dish.  I order the shrimp & grits and it was not that great.  My server knew I wasn't pleased and I ordered something to replace it.  The sandwich I ordered was much better.   I think this place is more hype than excellent food.
"Great diner, reasonable prices. After reading some of the other reviews I wouldn't go at a busy time, but my friend and I have gone for an early lunch around 11:30 twice and got a table shortly. The food is quirky, unusual combinations of ingredients and just delicious. I would strongly recommend the fish tostada with avacado and a slaw of chickpeas and cabbage!! A large portion, it blew my diet, but it was worth walking an extra mile or two and having an apple for dinner.It's a little loud, but the servers are great and so is the vibe."
"Meh. Our highlights were the lovely interior & a really nice waitress & a gluten free menu with several good options & a very tasty virgin Bloody Mary. The host stand staff was downright rude in all interactions and the food was just ok with each dish having notable flaws (overly greasy corn beef hash, undercooked pancakes, hashbrowns that tasted as if they'd been cooked in oil that was starting to go rancid). Given all of this plus the wait and the price point, not sure I'd give it a second chance."
"This was a great experience. The staff were extremely friendly and there was plenty of seating (Monday morning at 8:30am). It was really nice to see people smiling etc. It seemed as though they were genuinely happy to see us there. Beyond the hospitality, the hash with a fried egg was very good- the best corned beef hash I have had. The coffee was good and the mugs were big. I liked the space very much too- Its got great light and the decor is a blend of diner meets living room. Plus, I also really liked that the owners were walking around meeting with customers- its a nice touch when you get checked in on by a person with a real interest in your experience.Overall a 5."
"Big fan. We arrived at 9:30A this morning (Sunday) and were quoted a 45 minute wait for 4 of us. You can wait in Little Goat Bread (attached to the Diner) and grab a bloody mary, coffee, cinabun, or cactus (yes, they sell plants too) while you wait. The whole check-in process was smooth, hostess grabs your cell # and texts when the table is ready. Love that.15 minutes later and we were seated. Love that even more. The vibe is great. We ordered- 3 bloody marys, 1 mimosa, Fat Elvis Waffles, Pork Belly Benedict, Indian Burrito thing, Kimchee/eggs/bacon, and sourdough waffles + 2 orders of goat cheese hash browns and a side of bacon. Gluttonous to say the least!  We were all very full and extremely happy. Most definitely will return to try more of the menu."
"Great diner for visiting friends.  The food is remarkable.  Cheesy bread and fried pickles and onions are a great way to start.  Grilled Cheese, Fat Club and almost all of their sandwiches are incredible.  Would come back here again.  The menu is overwhelming with so many great items to choose from."
"After coming here one time, I felt that I need to come back to give The Little Goat another chance. Both food and service were excellent the second time around. My friends and I came on Friday night. We only had to wait thirty minutes for a table for three. I ordered the fish tostadas, which were amazing. My friends had ordered the pork belly with eggs and the sloppy goat, which they both liked very much. Finally, the vanilla milkshake was delicious. Service was excellent this time around. Overall, I would say that depending on what you get and your server for the evening, you can have an okay or an excellent experience. It is definitely worth the time to try this place."
"It's been a while since I've yelped.  I want to give LG 5 stars but there were a few drawbacks.  + loved the space and vibe+ decent size bar to wait for your table+ swede porcupine (swedish meatballs)+ smoke french fries+ goat chili rocks (lots of meat and only a few beans)+ service was fantastic+ Stephanie looks great- rueben was really gorgeous but the wonderful kim chee simply overpowered the corned beef.  They needed way more beef or less sauerkraut and kim chee. - TEXTING SERVICE didn't work for us so we waited a VERY long time (and drank a lot) and then finally flagged someone who made it up to us by giving us a cool booth.  Overall, I love this new spot in my hood and will be back many times...if I can ever get in again!"
"Everything bagel / Roasted cauliflower cream cheese: Excellent. Cinnabun: Really good. Love the spot, staff seems to be trying to figure it out (It was day 2 maybe). I'll be back for sure."
"We came in at noon on a Saturday and waited an hour and a half, which was to be expected I suppose. I had the ""Kimchee Bacon Tasty Asian Pancake Thing,"" or whatever it's called, and it was very tasty indeed, and managed to fulfill the hype around this place as a ""creative re-imagined diner"" or what-have-you (though my wife claimed it was too salty).The rest of the food wasn't anything special, however. My wife had the corned beef hash; the beef was stringy, the potatoes were flavorless, and it was sorely in need of spice, or some kind of seasoning. I also tasted a salmon salad, which was pretty good but not mindblowing. And the apple pie was a downer. Way too much pie crust, which was buttery and flaky but lacked crispness, and the small amount of apples inside were pretty bland. The chocolate shake was very good but also very expensive. I could look past the weaker parts of the menu if the service was better. But our server was fairly slow, forgot my wife's tea (and then failed to bring cream with the tea), dropped the check before asking if we wanted dessert, and affected an obnoxious ""old timey diner ambience"" attitude, calling the girls ""dolls"" and laughing each time he put down a plate; I have a feeling it was just as unpleasant for him to act that part as it was for us to hear it. Also, the soap dispenser in the bathroom somehow sprayed with such force that the soap ricocheted off my hand and sprayed all over my face. Not the most unpleasant thing that could happen in a bathroom, but still."
"So after an all day anticipation, and being really hungry I made the mistake of coming in at 3:45ish on one of their first Saturdays. They did so well that day that had to close the kitchen for them to regroup. I was a bit upset, and expressed it, but the cool headed staff handled my grumbling stomach and attitude really nicely. I was offered more than I deserved. I was shown the bakery side where they still had sandwiches, chili and a bar, it was clear to me at that point that they were just slammed. I cooled off, ordered the beef sandwich and the goat chili. It was all awesome. The staff couldn't be any more professional, the food is what you'd expect from these guys.With a little new restaurant forgiveness there is no way I couldn't give this place 5 stars. I will plan on coming in at an earlier time the next time I visit...which will be often. I am very glad they are in my neighborhood, and feel that they add a lot of value to the place I call my hood. I can't wait to explore more of the menu, and if the staff is reading this...sorry for my hunger inspired attitude."
"The 3 stars is for my own dining experience, but I'll relate what I gleaned from my co-diners as well.Went with my coworkers today and ordered the Shrimp and Grumpy Goats Grits. It was okay. It was a good-sized portion, but the flavor was just not good. It was overly salty and  I didn't understand the use of pistachios. Two of us ordered it and we both gave it a 6 out of 10.If you want truly great Shrimp & Grits go to Wishbone around the corner.That being said, my other coworkers ordered the Bull's Eye French Toast and the Reuben. Both said those were very good. Another highlight from their meals was the Tiramisu milkshake. I snuck a bite and it was incredible."
"3.5 stars. overall lovely. the shrimp and grits / or grits and shrimp was delicious...bakery real nice too...and the coffee (forgot the roaster's name) from portland, real good."
"Came here with the gf on a Friday night at 8pm. First mistake. The wait took about 50 minutes. The mistake wasnt that we came in when it was busy, the mistake was that we had to watch others eat such delicious-looking food as we sat there salivating.Sure enough, it was our turn and, wow, it was amazing. The gf and I shared the Hot Crab Dib (Highly recommended). It was amazing, we realized after our 3rd bite, that there weren't enough crackers for all the dip, and before we even asked the waiter came back with more crackers. Im pretty sure hes a mind-reader. We also shared a side of the mac-n-cheese, it looked so good from all the yelp photos, however, I regret to say that it was only okay. If I could have done it again, i would have chosen a another side or appetizer instead.Then came my sammich, Los Drowned. I have to admit, that i do not remember what my gf ordered. Mainly because this sammich consumed all my attention. Upon first bite, my heart melted, then stopped. Cardiac Arrest. I could have died there a happy man. Fortunately, i got to enjoy a few more bites before my belt told me that there was no more room.The waiter was pretty amazing considering the situation. he managed to frequently stopped by to ask if we needed anything else or gave ideas of other thngs we should try, without being too overwhelming. He told us on the Pork Smoothie, which was delicious and definitely worth a try.Come here at least once in your life."
"I have been waiting months to try this place. I have talked up this place to go for an earlier breakfast to every one of my friends that comes to visit Chicago, however we never make it because we end up sleeping in too late and the wait for a table will be 1hr and 45minutes without fail. FINALLY my sister came into town and has a puppy so we were up early enough to get to Little Goat and not have to wait to be seated. There were 4 in our group and we were seated after a 10minute wait. I was so excited! I ordered the Elvis waffles. I was sadly disappointed. I am not a sweet breakfast eater but I thought what the heck everyone raves about them so I will try them out...nope not impressed. I only ate half and swore to myself that I am coming back here soon and ordering something else so I can change this review I am writing now! The service was great! The orange juice and cinnamon buns are phenomenal and freshly made. The atmosphere is awesome with cool jams playing in the background. It's in the up and coming area of the West Loop in Chicago. It is owned by a top chef winner. The menu is humorously put together."
"Went there around midnight after a long work day, I was not expecting to get something really good at that time. I had the tofu griddle sandwich, which came out nicely presented and the taste was amazing! The combination of lightly fried tofu with goat cheese and pickled veggies got me hooked. Definitely go back there to try more of the menu."
"Problematic, to say the least.  This is the most disappointing new(ish) restaurant in Chicago.  They don't take reservations, which is fine, except their (ostensibly) first-come-first-serve seating system appears inefficient; for instance: I didn't receive my ""table's ready"" SMS until I'd already returned to the restaurant from my pre-brunch beer at Haymarket, at which point it was about twenty-five minutes after their estimated window ended, but still about twenty minutes before a table was prepared and my small party seated, despite the text-message asserting otherwise.  Furthermore: the wait-times are extravagant, and it doesn't really seem like the first-comes are necessarily first-served.This is Chicago.  All of these facets would present somewhat standard, and even acceptable, circumstances, were the fare to justify foibles.  At first-blush, the Little Goat does not.  Indeed: as it stands, I can find little justification for even giving Little Goat the charity of a second-chance.One companion ordered the ""Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian-Style Breakfast Tasty Thing"", of which the bacon, eggs, pancakes, and (especially) kimchee were pretty mediocre; which was only ""Asian-Style"" by virtue of said mediocre kimchee and an absolutely terribly-executed sauce that was thin and ill-suited for the dish, and that she (generously) described as ""some dumb Thai-style thing"";  and which, frankly, wasn't tasty but I guess could be accurately delineated a ""thing.""  The other ordered the ""Parathas Burrito,"" which appeared to me and was reported to be a bit of a weak, flat, uninteresting, and ultimately poorly-conceived and not-very-tasty mess (yet at least less not-very-tasty than the aforementioned and inaptly named ""Tasty Thing"").  The goat-burger, which I ordered Korean-style, was fairly good -- though largely on the strength of the Kilgus-Farmstead-sourced meat and the novelty of eating goat in burger-form, and not on account of any brilliance of composition or consummation.The menu *reads* great.  I was very excited to brunch here, went there aware of the seating conditions, popularity, and likely-lengthy wait on an early-Sunday afternoon, and entered the establishment fully-prepared to be at least satisfied, if not outright impressed.  But honestly, based on this experience, the Little Goat probably deserves half of the two stars I'm awarding it.  However, I'm sympathetically retaining the second because: (a) the goat-burger, while not superb, was far from the train-wreck and bus-crash that the other two dishes, respectively, were; (b) one experience is still just one experience; (c) they serve Horseshoes.Nonetheless: Au Cheval is two blocks further east, prepares a straight-up outstanding burger without even availing themselves of non-beef novelty, and - while being wildly better at executing the same sort of upscale-diner aesthetics - will probably be able to seat you in half the time, and with a better view to boot."
"The diner side is great for the most part. I've had breakfast there, as well as lunch. The service, attentive, fast and kind.  The food is good. Dinner definitely better than breakfast.I've stopped in for sandwiches, coffee, and bagels on the Bread side often. Always amazing. I'll keep going back and back. Love. That's the 4 stars.The missing one is for the god-awful bartender on the Bread side at night. Neck-beard (I'm sure that doesn't round it down too much but oh well), you know who you are. Its fine that you don't know how to make a Sazerac, ""oh you don't want ice in it?"". That's ok - no big deal. It's that you were a complete and utter a-hole to me. Yelling at me ""Mark WHAT!?"" when i was trying to get my bill to PAY YOU. I'll be back Neck-Beard. I hope you are not there."
"It was our 1st time there and definitely comparable to Girl & The Goat as far as unique and off-the-beaten path menu. The four of us went at 9am and the wait was only 15 minutes so I highly suggest that you go early to avoid the wait that seems to come during brunch/lunch time. The atmosphere is pretty typical of any West Loop - hipster, modern and energetic. The staff is friendly. The food was definitely different than your typical diner food but we definitely enjoyed the tasty experience. I had the Kimchi + Bacon + Egg Pancake, which was fantastic. The grits are great. The Bullseye French Toast was tasty and the Corned Beef Hash Egg was good although it was a little salty. The Spanish omelete looked good on the menu but definitely aggressive with the mix of food. I would definitely go back and again, just go early and your wait won't be that long."
"Just can't stop Yelping about The Little Goat!  Had the Fat Club today for lunch and it was so fat I could only tackle half of it.  Great, super friendly service as always!  My ""go to"" diner for breakfast, lunch and dinner!"
"Great food, great service. What's not to love? Even on a busy Saturday night our server took the time to accommodate our dietary restrictions (gluten free & dairy free) and help us choose the tastiest versions of the foods we wanted. We'll definitely be back!!"
"Yum!! Such an amazing veggie burger. I know its weird for me to write a review of a place that is known for being a diner and known for pork, but the veggie burger was delicious!! The fried pickles were amazing too!! I am sure if you love pork you will love this place, but I am also sure if you hate pork you will too! OINK!"
Absolutely loved this diner.  Ordering a goat burger is a MUST!!!
"More like 3.5 stars but I it's good for the neighborhood and Ms. Izard rocks so I rounded up.The bad:No reservations ahead of time, LONG wait, especially on weekends.  Expect to go early and have a drink at the bar because you'll never wait less than 30 minutes.  Food takes a LONG time to come out too.My BF and I are both over 6' tall and do not fit in the majority of seating there.  We always have to wait for a booth because we've tried to sit at the diner bar and the large tables and we literally do not fit.  Extra waiting time for a booth for us.Servers are inconsistent - some really seem to know the menu, some don't at all.  We've been about 7x and 2x my order was messed-up.  They did comp both times.I love that they have a vegan menu, but it's really unhealthy (I know, I know, it's a diner)!  But I always get the vegan burger (amazing) and don't eat the bread and there's no little healthy veggie side to get other than the soups (which do have some cream).The good:The food!  We've brought guests from out of town here and everyone is very impressed with the uniqueness of the venue, the delicious complexities of the menu, and the branding.The drink selection!  The beer and liquor choices are plentiful and the little bar/ bread cafe off to the side is adorable.So it seems like I wrote more 'bad' than 'good' but that just goes to show you how good the food and drinks are that we keep going back again and again.  It's just that type of place where you know you have to wait but you have fun every time.Another hit!!  I love the little goat graphics and the Izard merchandise too!!!"
Off to a great start!The Little Goat Diner is a well designed gastro-diner in the heart of the Randolph restaurant corridor. The incorporation of large windows and expansive skylights allows diners to be bathed in ambient light. The menu ranges from the mundane (corned beef hash and eggs - nothing special) to the fantastic (Duck Bahn Mi with duck confit and pate). The pancakes are wonderfully flavorful and airy. The Shrimp and Grits were incredible. The coffee is strong and delicious. For opening weekend the service was very good though our server was (understandably) not very facile with the menu and tended to be equally ebullient about all the items thus depriving of us of any true insight.
"You have to come here for brunch.My girlfriend and I were sitting at the counter and curiously watching how people work. This place is bright and vibrant, unlike any other places. You're gonna be wide awake!I went there in June during my stay in Chicago so I cannot remember what I ordered. But I found that everybody, including us was satisfied with their food. The plate was warm. I love warm plate. The portion was large, enough to comfort your empty stomach.Definitely will come back. BTW back in June it was already moved to a new address, just right across the street from where it used to be. I followed Serious Eats' recommend so the address info was out-of-date."
Er-ma-gherd! The Los Drowned sandwich is to die for. I have only experienced Little Goat for dinner. I've had a few of their sandwiches and they were all great. Their smoked fries are incredible. They come in a nice overfilled bowl which is nice for sharing. The services has always been great and the decor is beautiful with a dash elegance while still maintaining an overall 'diner' feel.
"My sister and I are both teachers/foodies and we've had a lot of time this summer to try new restaurants.  It's only fitting that we would head to Little Goat (I mean, we've heard SOOO many good things).  We went to Little Goat on a Friday morning at 10am (we just missed the early bird b-fast specials). Parking was difficult; we drove around the block a few times before finally agreeing to valet our car. Valet is cheaper before 10:30am. We paid $10 and we were there for about an hour or so.When we got in, the restaurant was crowded but it was a great atmosphere!  The lighting is amazing and very inviting.  We waited two minutes for a booth and the wait staff was VERY friendly.  There was definitely more of a line to get seated around 11am.  When we sat down, it only made sense to look around to see what others were ordering.  We told the waitress that we really wanted to order from the Early Bird Breakfast specials (note these specials are good Monday-Friday from 7-10am). She said that the portion sizes and prices change after 10am (meaning larger portions and more $$) so we decided to still give it a shot but we split the Early Bird Breakfast and added an order of Sticky Buns and Blueberry Pancakes.  Holy moly!  We were in for a treat and PLENTY of food.  The FOOD was amazing and so was the coffee!!!  Our breakfast included the following:-Biscuit (so good and melts in your mouth)-Bacon (perfectly cooked- love me some soggy bacon)-Scrambled eggs (still warm when they arrived at our table :)-Blueberry Pancakes (OOOO-MMMMM-GGGG.  I've had a lot of blueberry pancakes in my life, but nothing like this place.  The crumble was AMAZING)-Sticky Buns (this little plate of heaven blows Cinnabon out of the water.  I definitely recommend this when you visit & it is big enough to split between two people).-Coffee (even took a to-go cup because it was SOOOO delicious). I would definitely recommend this place!!!!  Don't forget to check-out the store on the side.  They make fresh bread, scones, muffins, etc. You can even get a cup of coffee to go."
I love this place. The Los Drowned touched my heart in a way that it's never been touched before. Great Atmosphere and Cool Staff. I'll definitely be back in the future to try some other items on the menu.
My co-workers and I stumbled upon The Little Goat and had such an amazing lunch on a Friday that we made a point of returning for brunch the following Sunday and were ecstatic with the whole experience. The atmosphere is super fun diner chic. Everything we ordered was beyond delicious.
"this is one of those places i want to keep going back to just so i can try the entire menu.  put your name in at the door, give them your # and they'll text you when they're ready.  awesome.  it's such a simple idea.THE NACHOS ARE EVERYTHING.  they are bananas.  not literally.  the tortilla chips are made with corn masa, so they're like crunchy in a chewy (in like a Keebler Pizzarias farm6.staticflickr.com/5…) sort of way.  they were my FAVORITE chips in the 90s.  remember the 90s?  yeah.  remember crystal pepsi?  that was dumb.  anyway.first time, came here on a 4th, great date.  we sat at the back bar, and he was hangry so we ordered the nachos, thinking they were gonna be a snack.  it was ginorm.  we also ordered alcohol and snagged some seats.  we were very happy and content there.  no need to order any more food.  another time i was there with my girlfriend.  it was a 10 min wait on a thursday at 7.  awes.  we sat at the counter and ordered the los drowned - braised beef sandwich, au jus.  she ordered the chickpea salad and loved it.i will be back.  i'd love to get some breakfast for dinner.  and maybe lunch for lunch."
"Unfortunately, this place is lives up (or down)  to it's ""little"" name.  The problem is not so much the food (well actually, I'd can do without a soggy Ritz cracker in my crab dip and a gummy fried onion ring), but the service is what gets me.  It blows!  How arrogant can you be to bring out people's food one at a time, especially when the entrees you are waiting on are salads, and premade salads at that?  Second time we've tried Little Goat, this experience was the same as the first... we won't be back.  Bummer."
"Just what the neighborhood needed!  We've been to Little Goat twice now, once for breakfast and the other for dinner.Go early on the weekend to avoid a wait. We went at 8:15 on a Sunday and sat immediately. Last weekend, we went at 9:30 there was a 45 minute wait. For dinner, we went at 5:30 on a Thursday night and sat right away.On the recommendation of our server, I ordered a Spanish omelette. It was fantastic. My fiancée ordered the Spiced Apple Pancakes and they were excellent as well. Make sure to use the homemade maple syrup on the pancakes.Sides are a la carte (around $5 each) and big enough for two to share. We had the hash browns They were shaved very thin, nice and crispy with melted goat cheese. Good stuff. The jury is still out for us on dinner. We tried the Reuben and grilled cheese. Definitely good, but not great. Sandwiches are around $12 and do not come with a side."
"I was SO SO excited to try this place. Heck I even wanted to have my friends treat me to this place for my birthday. So glad that I didn't because I would not have wanted to wait for a seat for almost 2 hours. Granted, we went there in a group of 5 on the Memorial Day weekend... Not that I am an expert in seat arrangement/management, I thought that they could do a better job forecasting the turnover rate and seating people based on the party size.Food-wise, in summary, sadly I really feel like it's trying too hard to be more than just diner food. It's almost like Goat & The Goat ideas with a sloppy presentation and less than impressive delivery of flavors and satisfaction.Of the things we ordered -{fried pickle}   Nothing compared to Texas style fried pickle. Would have been better with a beer. It kind of ruined my appetite for the main dish though.{brandade and belly}    We all truly enjoyed this dish. It most closely resembled my wonderful experience at G&TG. Eggs perfect poached, pork belly ever so tender and the kick and unexpected kimchi really elevated this dish beyond diner food.{pork belly pancake}    most anticipated but most disappointing. Maybe the cut of the pork belly was wrong as it was not tender and absolutely did not melt in my mouth. I also did not appreciate the scallion pancake that was on the harder side. Saw many people who ordered this and were blown away. I guess you just have to bear your own risk.{os drowned (beef sandwich)}   beef was flavorful and nicely cooked. Buns too drenched.{two other dishes}  that my friends said were ""pretty good"".Maybe we did not try the right things? In all honesty I would not want to return. I feel that the other menu items would be rather similar. Oh well, I suppose I can still stop by for their amazing coffee (friend got the little goat coffee) the next time I go to Mama Goat."
"I don't get the hype. I tried this place twice with friends who insisted they had to go. The first time I was unimpressed, but the service was great, and despite the mediocre food and coffee I enjoyed grabbing a bite with a friend and the opportunity to try something new.The second time I was equally unimpressed, and by then the service had already taken a serious nosedive. I genuinely can't figure out when anyone would eat here, when there are so many delicious alternatives available all around them."
"Where to even begin with Little Goat? During a week stay, we made a grand total of 5 visits, most with different pursuits in mind. I would recommend all of the dishes I tried--Tomato Apple soup (I would say the portion of the cup was smaller than expected), their macaroni was beyond decadent. Makes a great side dish to split between two people. The goat cheese included in the oatmeal was beyond genius, and the fruit bowl which includes pineapple, grapefruit, and grapes goes great when ordered together. Be sure to not skip out on the bakery, their Apple Pistachio bread is heavenly, and their coffee is even better. The bakery is accessible through the restaurant or they also have a separate door per access. The bakery also includes a bar, which was also a great place to grab a drink at, especially if you're waiting on reservations for the surrounding restaurants. All in all, great service, great food, great coffee bar, and affordable prices."
"Oh Stephanie, you've done it again! I am a huge fan of girl and the goat and have been so excited to try Little Goat ever since I heard that it was in the works. I have been to Little Goat twice now and have been very happy with my experience both times. Both times when I have gone there has been a wait, but their system is wonderful. You give your name, they quote you a time, ask for your number, and you can actually check how much longer you have to wait from your phone. You can also see how many parties are ahead of you. Also, while waiting you are more than welcome to go wait in the Little Goat Bread section for a drink, or a browsing of all of the little goat items. The food is exceptional!!  Some things that my friends and I have ordered that I would recommend are as follows: spanish omelette, fat elvis waffle, hash browns, cinnabon, apple spice pancakes, ham omelette, and of course, bloody marys. The service is also excellent and the servers are the most charismatic and friendly servers I have ever had in Chicago. All in all, GO HERE!!! You will not be sorry, especially if you are a breakfast/brunch lover. :)"
"While the service was friendly, the food was excessively salty and a bit overpriced. Starting with food: Salt is NOT a euphemism for flavor! I understand the restaurant is trying to cater to obese Chicagoland's sodium-driven taste palates; however, the amount of salt in my Reuben sandwich was too much! Heart disease, anyone?Items were ala carte. My friend and I each ordered sandwiches and a side of fries to split. The sandwiches are $12 each, which is fair but they couldn't throw in some fries, which are made out of potatoes and essentially the cheapest things ever? Ordered dessert afterwards, and it was underwhelming and overpriced at $8 for what was basically a cookie and a kiddie sized scoop of ice cream."
4 stars for the good looking people at this place. The decor and layout are nice. Service is spectacular. The menu is a bit limited and extreme at the same time. The food is really good but I have decided that it has TOO MUCH flavor. I know it sounds weird but while the dishes are creative they taste a little too rich. Dial it down a notch so I can continue to enjoy the ambiance and a couple of drinks..
"A trendy, cozy, cute diner style restaurant. My boyfriend started out with a ""Sure is Smokey, Burt!"" cocktail which tasted like a straight up campfire. It was the strange yet very intriguing. The waitress was super informative with what we should order. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was delicious! It was a dry pulled pork but very tasty. My boyfriend got the Los Drowned sandwich and the fries. The fries were skinny, crispy, and had a delicious smokey flavor which I've never experienced before. My boyfriend claims they are the best fries he's ever had! We had to force ourselves to not eat here for the second night so we could experience another food spot. We will definitely be visiting Little Goat again on our next visit!"
"Stars are somewhat a reflection of where our expectations are before we walk in the door. This was for dinner on a weekday night with 3 friends. Fried chicken was sold out by the time we got seated.Started off with some Macho Nachos. Solid, very sizeable offering. Entrees:- Korean Burger - The goat meat was nicely cooked, if a little underseasoned. The bread was pillowy and great. The kimchi...was not kimchi. More like the regular pickled cabbage one would get at a Chinese restaurant to whet the appetite. Great portion size but overall, the burger needed a little more kick to it. - Kalbi Ribs - Came with 3 sets of Kalbi. The ribs were cooked fine, probably under-marinated because there wasn't a whole lot of flavor in the meat. The dirty rice it came with carried a great crispy texture but was a little too salty. The dish came topped off with crispy onions, strawberry, and zucchini squash which took the edge off the salty rice and actually brought the different elements together. A solid if not inspiring serving. - Pork Belly Pancake - Didn't get to try this but my buddy said it tasted like she was eating salt; the house hoisin was just too much for her. - Breakfast spaghetti - Meh. Tasted like any other creamy seafood pasta. Sides:- Mac and Cheese: Solid. Sprinkled with bread crumbs. Well portioned for a side. - Smoked fries: Smoky. This was probably the only thing we ate that grabbed my attention as something unique and interesting. - Tempura mashed potatoes: The technique for getting the nice tempura layer over the mashed potatoes is to be commended but overall, this felt gimmicky. Flavor had no depth and didn't taste special or interesting. Came in two medium size rectangles on a small plate. Service was fantastic, our servers were attentive and helpful. The atmosphere is designed to be a little upscale but feels relaxed and casual. A clean and fun place to eat. Although this just reminds me of Tyler Cowan's rule from an Economist Gets Lunch about trendy, good looking restaurants opened by famous chefs where the food quality nosedives after the first several months of being open. I'm clearly against the grain here with 2 stars but considering the price and pedigree of Little Goat, I was expecting solid dishes with inspiring and/or deep flavors. Instead, I was underwhelmed. Yelp's 2 stars for ""Meh. I've experienced better"" sounds about right."
Love the ambiance and the Korean burger and Parathas Burrito
"The lady and I came here after a great experience at girl and the.goat a few days earlier.  This restaurant fully flushes out its concept of a high end diner, and totally delivers on the quality of food.  We split the Goat Joe and Party Melt.  The goat was noticeably leaner than a traditional.sloppy Joe and the Patty melt was juicy with a pronounced flavor of grass fed beef.  To finish, stumptown coffee and spices.pear topped cheesecake.  More light than the average pie and amazingly delicate crust....love chef Izzard."
"With no reservation for the evening and the inclination to try something new, a friend and I stumbled upon Little Goat and, having heard of it, decided to give it a try. The wait was about 40 minutes but a couple seats at the bar had just opened up so we decided to take them.The service was very friendly and the atmosphere seemed nice, though our seat faced a solid tiled wall and was back up by a pillar. But, I mean, other parts looked nice. We had the fried pickle appetizer, which was delicious. I ordered the blueplate special, which was pig's tail. There was some mishap and we ended up waiting quite a while for the food. Our server and the manager, however, were extremely apologetic and  we ended up leaving with an optimistic opinion of the experience.My entree was mediocre. I know it can be hard to capture a lot of flavor in pork sometimes and, well, this meal just reinforced that opinion.I will likely return."
"I hate to give Little Goat such a low review but honesty is the best policy. I went on a Thursday evening so I did not have to wait for a table. I was seated at a booth near the west wall of windows. The booths are on a platform so you need to be careful stepping on and off.  I had done a bit of research on Little Goat's menu since I have dietary restrictions. I can't eat fried and fatty foods, dairy, or pork. You must be asking why would I go to Little Goat then.  I know Little Goat is all about comfort food with a twist but it's menu did include salads. One of my issues with Little Goat is that it does not offer many low fat, healthier options. I wish I could pig out on their menu but I do not want to spend the rest of my evening at the ER. I informed the waiter of my dietary restrictions and he tried to be as helpful as possible. I was very impressed.  After asking the waiter for recommendations, I settled on the Asian shrimp salad and my dad ordered the fried chicken. We also ordered the dinner rolls.  So far so good.I was not impressed with my salad when it arrived at my table.  The menu describes the salad's ingredients as the following: cabbage, bok choy, radish, red oak, crisp wonton, and ginger maple. The waiter also told me the salad came with kimchi.  My salad consisted of a bowlful of coleslaw, a handful of spring green lettuce mix, and 8 baby shrimp. The shrimp were tasty but I could have done without the mountain high pile of coleslaw. I did not taste any bok choy nor kimchi.  My dad's $22 fried chicken looked promising. However, the chicken's skin was not crispy. The breading fell off as soon as my dad dig his fork and knife into it. He did rave that the chicken was not dry. It was rather juicy. He also loved the mashed potatoes. So, I guess the fried chicken is a safe option to order. I would give 5 stars to the dinner roll alone. It was delicious.  I may try Little Goat some day for breakfast or bread. I hope that in the near future Little Goat can offer a few healthier options."
"Food was delicious...options on the menu that, at first, I was afraid to try, but tasted great! Only down side is that services is a little slow, but I think that is the price you pay for great food!"
Went here for brunch on a Saturday with friends. We waited about 45 mins for our table. I ordered the Spanish omelette and was very disappointed in my meal. Would  not order that again or recommend it!
"I was excited to try Little Goat yesterday because I loved Girl & The Goat. I knew Little Goat was more like reinvented diner food but I wasn't expecting the disgusting combinations of flavors. While perusing the menu, I didn't see anything that sounded remotely appetizing, so I ordered something that sounded safe, Kalbi Beef Ribs with dirty rice and fried onions. Boy was I wrong! The ribs themselves tasted fine but the rice was disgusting! It was like they tried to bread and deep fry the rice. I was so disappointed with my meal. After quickly eating my entree just to get it over with, I ordered the cookie pie with vanilla ice cream for dessert, hoping to rid myself of the horrible taste of my dinner. The cookie pie was good, what's not like about a warm chocolate chip cookie topped with ice cream? I will never try Little Goat again! I really wish I could get my money back because it was the most disgusting meal I ever had."
"I've been to Little Goat twice, once for a late post-theatre dinner and yesterday for lunch. I enjoy all the attention to detail at Little Goat. A few things I like...-The text message app thing they use to tell you when your table is ready-The witty menu (e.g. ""Asian breakfast tasty thing"")-The olde thyme knick-knacks-The logo and Stephanie Izard (she's always scurrying around her restaurants, and every time I'm a little star struck!)-Portland's finest Stumptowm coffee -Little Goat Bread -The hours!-Fish tostadas -Fried Pickle Sammie The portions are way too big, and I sort of wish they had at least ONE light beer option (Coors Lite, perhaps?) to accompany the gigantic portions (I would have drank more over lunch if so!). There are lots of things I plan to try on my next visits, and I'll probably always walk away with bread to go. Yum."
"I'm not quite sure what to make of this place.  On the one hand, it's a diner through and through: greasy, comfort food.  There is a sense of elevation: the quality of ingredients is high, and there's an interesting Asian twist, that you would never expect.  In theory, some of the combinations don't make sense, which I think is the point, really pushing the fusion envelope.  The problem is, that they actually don't work.  I felt like this was an opportunity for genius to shine through, but it just missed the mark.  We got the goat chili cheese fries to share as an app, and then I got the reuben as my main.  I basically ran into the same problem that I had at Girl and the Goat: the quality is good, but there was always one ingredient I would have liked to have taken out.  That being said, this is some serious comfort food.  As a note, I eat a lot of unhealthy food, but this did give me a stomach ache after I was done.  Not a food poisoning kind of ache, just a grease belly.  It may be exactly what you're looking for as a hangover cure, but for me, it was just too much."
"Hi, I recently visited Little Goat for a late lunch.  I ordered the apple pancakes and my friend the chicken sandwich with fries.  To start, the wait was about 20 minutes but what was odd was that when we were sent a text that our table was ready, we had to wait another 10minutes.  I was curious that no one was coming to get us for the table.  I then  went to the counter again and the lady said that they were wondering what happened to us, even though we had come up to the counter earlier.  When we were seated, the table was half cleaned and then I noticed stains on the wall beside me.  It took a while for the food to come and not in any particular order.  My friend finished their sandwich and then their fries arrive after.  We spoke with a manager, who was quite pretentious, and just stated ""that's how our kitchen is.""  I love the food here, but the service needs quite a bit of work."
"Visiting the Little Goat was a planned event that our group had been salivating over for weeks. We made sure to get there early on Sunday morning (we were bringing a baby and didn't want to subject the rest of the crowd to her screaming if we had to wait). We walked in around 9:15am and were seated right away in the communal-ish section of the restaurant. We had plenty of room and to our delight this place was family-friendly, comfortable and DEELISSSSSSHHHH!I had the Corned Beef Hash (ZOMG) and my wife had the special veg omelette of the day (ZOMG X TWO) and our friends tried the waffles with chicken (chicken for breakfast?? - hell yeah!) and some sort of benedict. I can't remember. Doesn't matter we sampled each other's plates and NOM NOM NOMMED it all. OH! The apple-spice pancakes. In the words of Rachel Ray, *raspy voice* YUMMO!Our server (god I wish I could remember his name... zack?) was awesome. Attentive, helpful, friendly, FAST, all of the things you wish you got everywhere else you pay money for food.We even saw Stephanie!! She was busy but we would have loved to grovel at her feet if given the chance. *waves*I recommend this place for casual dining, taking your out-of-town friends or relatives for a taste of Top Chef or just stop by for your last meal. IT IS WORTH IT.OH CRAP. I FORGOT THE OOEY GOOEY CINNAMON BUNS that were obviously made by the devil. BECAUSE YOU WANT TO EAT 12. *dies*Go to there. Go to there now. Love it. Eat everything. They also have good jam. Just sayin."
"I LOVE FOOD and always make it a point to check out good food. So I've heard so many great things about this place, it was next on my list. Best way to describe this place is that its like an upscale American diner, way to go on the decor, its nicely made in there. The wait was an 45 minutes with 1 couple in front of us on a Wednesday at 9pm. I really didn't get that one and got kinda irritated cause it wasn't slammed like it always is. Maybe a server was out and those empty booths were that guys tables. So off to a bad start, we ordered about 7 dishes (which included a 2 appetizers, 4 main dishes, and a slice of pie) between the three of us, to get that weird wait behind us and on to the food! Out of the seven dishes we tried and the bread with the kimchi butter and the Blood Orange Meringue Pie (dessert) were my favorite. It's good for a meal but its nothing amazing.Go in with a fresh mind and check them out, it's a decent place to eat and drink good coffee. But don't go in believing all the hype otherwise you'll be disappointed.  We've gone twice and tried various things thinking it'd get better, it didn't. Some of the dishes were too salty or just had too many flavors going on in one dish.  Just wasn't my cup of tea."
"Do you hate the lines? Do you ponder ""this is a diner, I should be seated and eating my food already?"" It's because you don't go at 7 AM! Hate Wednesdays? Treat yourself to some Little Goat before work! You run in the morning? That's absurd, just stuff your face with Asian-diner fusion goodness and forget about it. I do warn you that the kitchen folk are also not morning people. Ok maybe Stephanie but that's because she's Superwoman. So my meals have been a bit sub-par at 7 AM - as in why is this cold? But the coffee keeps coming in a mug I want to steal (but haven't I promise... yet). Being Asian, I am not 100% behind some of her fusions, but if you go for diner food fare I'm sure you will be happy."
"The goat chili was superb. Smoked fries, too (crispy matchstick fries, interesting smokiness). The goat coffee (with goat's milk and a little carmelized sweetness) was top notch.Yes, the wait can be long, but it's wildly popular for a reason. Get over it."
"I took my Girlfriend, Taylor, here for her 25th birthday. Let me first start off by thanking our waitress Christina. She was the perfect level of attentive. Not too much, but not too little. She was very friendly and informative, and seemed like she was able to hold down the section that she had (including us) very well. I am very picky when it comes to waitresses and she did VERY well.  Next, I'd like to thank Greg, the head baker. Not only did Greg go above an beyond by taking Taylor on a tour of the bread bakery (Taylor is a baker herself so something like is very special to her), but he also offered to let her come in whenever she'd like to help out and learn how they operate. As if that wasn't enough, Greg also had a special made bread platter with ""Happy 25th Birthday Taylor"" baked into it. VERY COOL and VERY UNIQUE! Greg was very personable and easy to talk to and I am very glad to have met him.  I would also like to thank Mark, the GM. Without him, none of this would've even been possible. I was in contact with Mark from the very start by email and he arranged for the entire evening including the tour of the bakery, a table being set aside from us, and the pastry department baking Taylor a special ""Happy Birthday"" cake. Lastly, I would like to thank the rest of the staff at The Little Goat. From the moment we walked in, we were treated with great respect and felt very warm and welcome, before they even knew who we were. Then I told them who were were and the friendliness doubled. The flow of birthday wishes to Taylor was a gesture that I, myself, very much appreciate.   Now, as far as food and atmosphere are concerned. Let me put it this way...I cannot WAIT to come back! The atmosphere is that of a traditional diner, if it were given a good touch of class. Candles were lit at every table, people were dressed in ""dress casual"" yet, it was still the same volume almost as a sports bar. (not to say it was too loud to hear eachother talk, but it wasn't so quiet that you had to whisper either)  We started off with an appetizer of fried pickles and onion rings, with two sauces (ranch and curry ""something""). VERY delicious and not overwhelming to where you'd be full to not want to eat your meal. Just what an appetizer is supposed to do!  For my meal, I ordered The Fat Club and got Smoked Fries with ranch on the side. The fat club is exactly what you'd think it would be, a HUGE club sandwhich with ton more than a standard club on it. I'm a 250lb athlete with an appetite, and I could only eat half of it. The fries were amazing (even though Taylor ate half of them! but that's love I guess).  Taylor ordered a goat burger, done All American style, with a broccoli puff on the side (which I enjoyed VERY much).  Then dessert was brought out as a surprise for Taylor, specially made just for her. Chocolate cake, with a peanut butter cream frosting, and what tasted like nestle crunch peaces at the bottom of the cake. Very delicious!   Overall, I was more than satisfied with our experience and it means a lot to me that The Little Goat made Taylor's birthday special to her. Thank you again to you all!!!"
"A regular spot for me and my fiance.  Great variety and atypical food combos make for an interesting visit everytime.  One thing we always get are the fried pickles and onions, as well as the stumptown coffee!"
"I ate at Little Goat this past Monday evening with a friend. We arrived around 6:30 and were told there would be a short wait of around 15 minutes. Barely 5 minutes later, we were seated so things were off to a good start.We decided to share an appetizer of the lump crab cheesy dip with ritz crackers. It was good, especially on a freezing cold night, though we ran out of crackers and had to settle for using our utensils to finish the remainder. For my entree, my buddy had the sloppy goat with an order of fries and I had the fried chicken which was served over mashed potatoes and gravy. We both enjoyed our dishes but thought the prices were a little high given the portion size. The fried chicken was $22 and included 4 pieces of chicken; however, they were on the small side. I partly ordered it thinking it would be a large amount and I would have leftovers when in reality I had no problem finishing it. My friend thought his sandwich would have been a better deal if the fries were included. Service was great and everyone seemed very friendly."
"Thought the Korean Burger w/ kim chi and short rib topper was pretty unique. Same goes for tells Cheez-It sundae. Went around the corner to RM Champagne Salon for the hour wait, which worked well."
"I had the Pork Belly with a potato pancake. That dish is simply amazing. I highly recommend you make reservations if you're going to be a table of four or more. We waited for about an hour (we were 5). The good thing is that there is a bar that you may go to while you wait. All in all, a great experience, and the menu is different. Love the diner atmosphere with a twist."
It was super packed but we were fortunate not to have to wait to long to be seated. The service was a bit slow and chaotic but I know they had just opened so I'm sure it will improve. The staff was really friendly and helpful in spite of the slow service.I had a pork belly pancake. It was delicious and I'm sure I shaved some time off my life. A couple of the other items in our group had goat burgers and enjoyed them.I will definitely be back to sample more of the menu.
"This is such a great place and the food is amazing. I had ordered the fried chicken sandwich with fries - the chicken was a bit raw in the middle and when I've asked the served if that's the way it should be, he apologized and took it away and another fresh sandwich was brought up to me within minutes. Also, a fresh side of fries! If you eat half of the sandwich you are set to be full and it's also soooo yummy!!!! When I was done with my order, my server packed up my food and the manager came up to me and apologized for the incidents with my chicken and told me she took care of my bill and invited me back - everyone is so nice here!!!! I am definitely coming back here with my family! Great place!!!"
"Had a great first experience at Little Goat and will definitely be back.  Met a friend for an early dinner on a Wednesday night.  No wait, seated immediately.  Service was great and the blueberry pancakes were heaven on a plate.   Served with cream cheese butter, oatmeal crumbles and the best maple syrup I've ever had (our server explained that it was the winner at the national maple syrup convention this year - um yeah, I believe ya).  The portions were ginormous and I took the leftovers home to my hungry and thankful husband who promptly devoured them and pronounced them amazing as well.  Go here.  Eat pancakes.  I'm sure the rest of their dishes are yummy as well."
"Really really good. Just be prepared to bring a hefty wallet.  A large OJ is $5...yikes! But that is the price you pay for a spot on Randolph St. The food is DELICIOUS. We came for breakfast on a Saturday and were told it was going to be a 45 minute wait. W were going to leave and come back another time when less busy but see walked over to the cafe side (yummy looking breads and coffee) to see what they had to offer but decided we would eat elsewhere. We wanted the real deal breakfast that day. As we were leaving, the hostess stopped us kindly and said to bar seats just opened up so we grabbed them! Just our luck! This place is beautiful btw. So we had a great server, enjoyed a cinnamon bun and I had a special omelette of theday while my boyfriend had their breakfast burrito. Everything was delicious as was their $5 juice...but probably will just stick with water or coffee for next time since the food is what is truly worth paying for. I have my own juicer at home so can make fresh OJ for days! :)"
"As a Top Chef fan, I had high expectations. They were definitely met here. Best breakfast I've ever had at a restaurant. Fun way to end our Chicago vacation."
"Little Goat failed to live up to my expectations, which were admittedly enhanced due to the enormous buzz surrounding it. And ultimately, I have kind of a mixed feeling about the two sections: I really enjoy the coffee bar and bakery section - especially early before crowds on weekends. It's a perfect neighborhood location to read the paper and a down a quick shot of espresso. The bagles/cream cheese are really good too. On the other hand, we recently had breakfast/brunch at the restaurant section which has a great diner look and feel. I ordered the Spanish Omelette, a simple gauge for diner food. For the price and buzz, I was underwhelmed with the overcooked eggs and uninspired pepper/tomato/onion topping. I get that Little Goat supposed to be a diner, but at least at a real diner the omelette only costs $4.50. I'll definitely go back and try one of the more adventurous dishes at some point, but I really think the omelette should be a soft ball to hit out of the park.So, as the star rating says, Little Goat was good, but ""I've experienced better;"" I have no idea why anyone would wait in line. Hipster scam, indeed."
"I loved this place. We went for brunch a couple weeks ago- was nice enough we could sit outside. Food is innovative, creative & delicious. My friend had the Reuben- it had pickled cabbage on it, was amazing. I had the you guest w homemade granola- I I loved the yogurt - it was amazing. I had never tasted anything like it...had fresh blueberries & honey it. So unusual I kept wanting more. My husband had the biscuits & gravy (he's a southern boy) the biscuits were homemade & fresh out the oven. We all shared the hash browns which were stringy like spaghetti a, but deliciously light potatoes. They also have a Bloody Mary bar, but we were all behaving that day. I can't wait to go back & try more"
"I want to eat everything here. Literally everything. I think it'll take me about 20 more trips to do so, but I'm up for it.My friend and I came here around 2pm on a weekday. There was no wait, and we were seated right away. Our hostess was cheerful and helpful, and successfully helped me navigate the menu and gave suggestions. I ended up going with the korean burger with a veggie patty, and my friend got the fish tacos. We split the onion rings and the fried pickles. They were absolutely divine. A perfectly seasoned batter, fried to perfection, with delicious sauces to accompany them. As for the burger, I was in love. I can count on one hand the number of good veggie patties I've had in Chicago, and this makes the list. You can see tender chunks of vegetables throughout, and the patty is spiced perfectly. Not mushy, and crispy on the outside. The rest of the burger was amazing as well. Fried egg, kimchi, you can't go wrong. I was a little apprehensive about the kimchi as I had had Girl and the Goat's kimchi a few weeks earlier and it was very salty. This was perfect and gave a nice punch to the burger.Now, here's for the best part of the meal-the dessert. Holy moly. We ordered the peppermint mattie, which was spiced chocolate gelato, peppermint gelato, chocolate peppermint sauce and whipped cream. Absolutely out of this world. The peppermint sauce on the top actually tasted like real mint and not the artificial stuff. I will be back for more, and believe me, I will eat through this whole menu."
"Had the ham, egg and cheese Namlette.  Nan-like bread was delicious.  The scrambled egg was well-cooked, but under-seasoned.  Walk-up service at 7:15 am on a Tuesday was slow and not very attentive, which was the biggest disappointment and the reason for two stars.  The wait for the sandwich from the time I ordered was 15 minutes."
"Two friends and I had our weekly ladies night here and we had the kale salad, macaroni and shrimp & grits. We all split a side of the smoked fries and they were great.  I had the shrimp & grits and I have to say being quite the foodie that they were AMAZING! The best I have had in Chicago and my friend agreed.Definitely give Little Goat a try! Also, the pricing isnt too bad especially if you think about Girl and the Goat's pricing."
"I have now tried both Little Goat and the Little Goat Bakery next door and had very different experiences. My husband and I first went to the bakery to pick up some lunch. We tried the goat chili, shrimp sandwich, turkey sandwich and brought home a loaf of the sourdough bread. Food came out quickly and everything was amazing! The sandwiches were incredibly creative and wowed our taste buds. Would totally recommend stopping in for a quick bite or to grab some food to take home. The next day I had my friends meet me at the diner and we unfortunately did not enjoy our experience as much. It was only the second day it opened so understandably there were a lot of kinks and some service errors. We were happy to overlook that but the food that came out did not impress any of us. We tried the eggs benedict (came out cold), the fat club (boring), duck sandwich (decent) and tuna melt (ok but covered in olives). They were all just ok which is not what I expect after waiting an hour to be seated and knowing how wonderful the bakery and Girl and the Goat both are. The one item we did all love was the crab dip but it came with about half as many crackers as you would need for all the dip so we had to ask for more, twice.I am hoping that they quickly improve the service and some of the menu items. The décor was perfect and cozy. I am definitely willing to go back but probably not for about a month."
"This place did not disappoint!  After dinner at Girl and the Goat, I decided to try Little Goat for breakfast.  This place has the creativity of Girl and the Goat, but I have to say Stephanie took it up a notch by adding a bit of twist to all the dishes and was not afraid to experiment.  ""Little goat"" was a goat milk latte that sounded delicious...I've never had anything like it.  It might be a bit ""goaty"" for people who don't like the gamey taste though.  The tempura mashed potatoes were heavenly and delicious.  The pork belly Benedict aka the brandade and belly was stuffed w pork belly and savory to the last bite.  I wasn't a fan of the bull's eye french toast though.  The toast was a bit thick and dry for me and the taste wasn't all there, although there was a surprise splash of sunny side up eggs inside the toast.  All in all, I was impressed by the amount of creativity put into all the dishes.  Service was prompt and friendly and the environment was very comfortable.  Our waitress Alexandra also did an excellent job recommending dishes!"
"though the food was really good and i'd recommend it to everyone, the restaurant's ubiquitous goat logo appears to be intoxicated/inebriated and as a christian, i cannot recommend bringing ur children here bc of this."
"The pork belly sandwich is excellent! Very generous portions, very filling, and very very tasty. Goat chili cheese fries is very good too, though you'll probably want to use a fork for those, as they can get pretty messy. Fish tostados is so-so. Make sure you come here on a weeknight, and hopefully before 6pm, otherwise the wait can get pretty long, since they don't take reservations. I'm definitely coming back at some point!"
"First time traveling to Chicago and a friend had suggested this place, so we decided to try it out. Absolutely fantastic food. The Bull's Eye French Toast was to die for! Everyone at the table loved their meals. Our waitress even took the time to give us the rundown on shopping areas and places to see. I wish I could go back right now and try out the rest of the menu!"
"Pros:  Service was great.  Attentive water guy and nice server.  She definitely knew the order and checked before I could ask about 20 min. tempura pickles.  Nice giant open kitchen with a bunch of line cooks and decor was quality.  Coffee shop doesn't disappoint; great service and a perfect latte with a nice design.Salad was gigante - fiancée says she'll eat it for lunch for the next two days.Would have been two stars but the music was worth an extra one... stellar.Cons: 20 minute tempura.  Fries came out McDonald's cold - you know when they're trying to sell really cold fries; it's on the fry guy.  Bahn Mi needed a whole lotta acid; it was really heavy and on the whole good but, still needed a little help.  The soup while tasty was the consistency of gravy.  All in all I'd go back and they were busy but I know what to expect now."
"nice server, moderate to okay food, the setup for service was not actually very coordinated. Not the server's fault. Give your staff a tray if they need it!"
"Have we ever stopped to consider the cost of advancement? What are we leaving behind as we hurtle recklessly into the future (the end)?You can dress up the concept of a diner with better ingredients and higher prices. We will come and fork over our money. Society of the spectacle, after all.But a line must be drawn. Man must have a code. So should ""diners."" No breakfast in the afternoon, you say? I'll never be whole again."
"If there are eight things that are known by Chicago, it's that ""The South"" is ""hilarious"" and ""Steel Manginas"" and ""Fried Green Tomatos"" and stuff. The food that was eaten by me when this place was visited by me was good, though was basted in this irony. Ultimately it was enjoyed by me and my date. I think that fewer Cheerwine was made to be in my glass than was was drank by me ideally but also that's acceptable I mean it can't be found by me or anyone else around Chicago so it's up to ""That Little Goat"" to provide it. Oops I was regrettably made to be distracted by how attractive the waittress was but mainly because of the shortest hemline that was worn by her combined with full-sleeve tattered two's that in ""the real South"" her momma would have slapped her ignorant for even considering adopting. Thick-cut country bacon ass, tho!"
"Ill preface by saying the first time went to Little Goat it was great, by diner standards. This time, not so much. The appetizers were pretty good. Highlight was pork nachos and the weak link was the frail and flavorless fried pickles. The waiter was cool BUT he recomended a beef sandwich that was a soggy mess, it reminded of a drunk friend trying to hold it together while talking to a girl at a bar but actually just embarrassing himself. The rest of the entres were equally as bad, and ill save you from any additional metaphors."
Very unique menu that isn't too offensive for the picky eater. Lots of kimchi. I've been twice and haven't needed to wait as long as you sit at the counter or a communal table!
Went there shortly after it opened.Great beer.  cool diner feel with fancy eats.I had the fancy eggs benedict.  (awesome party in my mouth)My hubbie had the lamb burger (it was good but a bit overcooked a dry)Would recommend I think the breakfast dishes seem to be the best.
"Oh how I wished I lived in Chicago!!! Not that Atlanta has good food but I loved eating at Little Goat. I would eat here every day and every week! My friend and I came here for breakfast on a weekday morning. So it was great the place wasn't too crowded and we were able to get service very quickly. Our server Joanie was super sweet and very energetic for 7:30am! I am not a morning person. So not sure how she could be so perky that early in the morning. ;) The place is a cute little diner yet with little vintage touches. My friend asked for a recommendation and had a few questions on the menu and Joanie was really helpful in answering our questions. I opted for the Simple Goat (it's not on the main menu but listed on a tent card on the table to the side). This dish had your choice of eggs (I got scrambled), bacon, a crazy serving of hash browns, and a choice of biscuit or toast (of course opted for the biscuit). My friend ordered the sourdough pancakes and questioned the grits. She's originally from South Carolina and she knows her grits. Me on the other hand being a native New Yorker knows absolutely nothing about good grits! So I could respect her interrogation of how they are prepared and what good grits really are. She opted to try them and said they were the best she's ever had! My friend even scraped every last bit with her spoon. They were that good. So get the grits - they are Southerner approved!!! :) She also liked her sourdough pancakes. My breakfast was really good as well and I recommend the Simple Goat and right now I'm craving the bacon!!!!!! On my return trip to Chicago, I plan on taking my husband here because first of all he's referred to as ""Goat Boy"" (he used to have a long goatee) and I know he would really appreciate the wholesome tasty food that Stephanie Izard has put together."
"Takin sandwiches to a new level. This spin-off of Girl & the Goat delivers! The interior is modern, food visually and aesthetically pleasing and they bring it out quick. They are a bit loud here, since it's always packed, but it's worth the wait and the noise to try there sandwiches!"
"We just ate at Little Goat Diner for the first time and loved it!As huge Girl and the Goat fans, we were excited to finally dine at Stephanie Izard's Little Goat Diner. Although we had been to Little Goat Bread several times before (and even got to meet Stephanie in person!) we had struggled getting seats in the Diner on various occasions (we're not ones to wait ~2 hours for a table...). However, we visited on an off hour this time and got lucky, because we walked in to the gorgeous diner and were immediately seated! The waitstaff was excellent; very friendly and in line with the staff at Izard's original restaurant across the street. As expected, the place was crowded. Definitely the place to try in Chicago right now. What we ordered:--Crispy Shrimp Cocktail--We loved this dish! It was the perfect appetizer to share and was a great take on the traditional shrimp cocktail; crispy shrimp wrapped in fried somen noodles with a dollop of creamy sauce on top of bibb lettuce wraps that were then dipped in cocktail sauce. This dish was equally creative and delicious. This is something we look forward to having again!--Fried Pickles and Onion Rings--This dish deserves some praise; it's an update on a classic guilty side infused with the thoughtfulness of Izard's menu. The perfectly fried onion rings were made with pickled onions, which gave every bite an extra bit of flavor. They were served with ranch and curry mayo dipped sauce, which we devoured. Definitely not your average side...--Fish Tostadas-- These were good, but probably our least favorite from everything we ordered and we'll opt to try something new next time. The tortillas were very crispy, the fish was lightly fried, and the flavors complimented each other well. We had three tostadas filled with crisp whitefish, shallot aioli, pickled jalapeño peppers, and a chickpea and onion salad. --Parathas Burrito--This dish was incredible, inventive, and left us wanting more! After much discussion, we agree that this was the most unusual and best thing we ordered. This breakfast burrito was made of an indian flatbread and filled with mashed potatoes, sunny side eggs, an avocado-bean salad, chili pepper sauce, and then topped with frisee and kidney bean salad that was tossed in a vinaigrette. It will be difficult for us to return to Little Goat without ordering this dish!We look forward to dining at Little Goat again sometime soon! With such a large menu, we know we'll have plenty of options to try out on our next visit!"
"The staff was very attentive and friendly. Multiple craft beer options on the menu. Their sandwiches are messy, but great. I'd go back and give their breakfast a shot."
"Great new spot in the West Loop!  This diner is so cute and super casual, which I love!  The food is super rich, but the drinks are very refreshing.  Of course I recommend the daily special or the Kale Salad.  The french fries aren'd bad either.  Be prepared for a wait."
"I want so badly to give the Little Goat a five star review. Just can't. If I were basing this on food only, five stars. If I were basing this on service, negative five. If I were basing this on whole experience, two to three stars. Let's talk about the experience. When we visited, it was 96 degrees outside. Oh, guess what?  THE AIR CONDITIONING WAS BROKEN at The Little Goat.  Brutal. This was definitely a fluke. It was Africa hot in there. Stuck to seat. Thick humid air. Sweat dripping off of everyone. Again, review cannot be based on this fluke; they were addressing while we were there. They felt so awful about it, the manager provided us a gift card for our troubles. Very nice. So why bring this up if willing to overlook?  This, on top of the horrible service, made for a long lunch. I almost want to believe that the server was struggling with the AC being down. Our server, was awful. Dirty plates on our table stacked in the middle, empty water glasses, empty cocktail glasses. No silverware. Missing, all the time, she was. The worst. So are all confused why four stars? The food is AMAZING. Overlook what I would call a fluke and try the gourmet comfort food. The menu is diverse and fresh. The ingredients are of high quality and the portions are plentiful.  We loved our food options. I had the chicken cordon blue. Delicious, and to die for.  We started with the nachos. They were full of flavor. The food alone is definitely five stars. I hope the work out thee other stuff for more positive experiences."
"I am trying hard to love this place, but right now I'm stuck on liking it just okay. Okay enough to return, since it's on the same block as where I work (another restaurant) and I can always snag a counter seat in the later afternoon for a salad and coffee before my shift starts at 4:30. I really like the space and the vibe -- it's cheery and well-lit and the service I have had has been good. Not overly intrusive, but I never felt forgotten. Confession: I've only had salads here. They are not the focus of the menu. I've had the Asian shrimp salad and Steph's Salad. Both were okay. Good, substantial portions, but both times, the lettuce was just not the freshest. Definitely some wilted lettuce in there...didn't seem local or fresh, more like a few-days-old-Jewel-quality. Which was disappointing. Not inedible, but not what you would expect when you're paying $14 for a salad. And both salads were a bit overdressed, so everything got soggy quickly. I was also confused by the two dressings on the Steph's Salad -- it comes tossed with a tamarind dressing, but then they also give you ranch on the side. But the salad already is dressed in a creamy dressing so the ranch seems redundant. I added a little, to see if it, like, revolutionized the flavor profile or something, but no dice. Just added Ranch flavor, which seemed random. I only need one dressing on my salad at a time (call me old school). But still, I want to keep giving Little Goat more chances...I LOVE Girl and the Goat and I refuse to believe this place is mediocre."
"Great spot for brunch, Little Goat has a fantastic menu of traditional and interesting breakfast and lunch entrees.  Bright and lively atmosphere, and friendly service.  Shrimp and grits were tasty, with five medium shrimp, goat cheese grits, roasted pistachios, and crisp asparagus.  Looking forward to trying the huge sandwiches on my next visit.  Cool bar, bakery and coffee bar make this a great destination."
What a great restaurant. The food was so rich and diverse. I want to eat everything in the menu. All if the staff members were super nice and friendly as well!
So was really excited to try this place based on the Girl and the Goat and the reputation.  I am a little bit of a coffee fan and like to find the best cafes where ever I am and have found some real gems and Chicago has a few.  I love the food as this place really made me smile from that stand point but the coffee could have been better.  I love Stumptown but as with all cafes it is really dependent on the barista in control of that shot or pour over and that can make all the difference.   In this case it was rushed and really didn't have any taste whatsoever but that doesn't mean it won't be stellar next time so we are sticking with a 4 star for now!
"A bit disappointing. Not good enough for that girl & her goat. Convoluted odd menu. Nothing bad but rather ordinary. Will go again to try brunch items, but frankly the wait , the valet, just did nt make this food worth it. Fried pickles & onion rings were pretty bad. All tempura batter. No pickle no onion & unappetizing looking. Server Melissa efficient & very very nice. I think they need to think through this menu. Los drowned ok, same for fish tostadas , tater tot mash broccoli cheese puff. Again Melissa helped make my b day lunch very nice!  Also when waiting an hour & ppl walking in that you hav nt seen being seated before you, would be nice to have hostess/mgr ""touch base, keep you posted"" about your wait status. We were only ones waiting so they had time to make eye contact , day something. Needs improvement in customer service there !"
"Great place to grab a bite on the go or sit down for a longer experience!  The non-pretentious hipster-like diner has a massive skylight with windows all around.  Intelligensia coffee on tap, and equally impressive food creations."
I came here early on a Friday morning so I could see what all the buzz was about.  Buzz is right. The breakfast menu is rather daunting but the selection is unique than anything I've ever experienced before. I had the breakfast burrito or whatever the heck it was and it was out of this world...and so were the cheese grits. Service was outstanding. I will be back
An entirely separate experience from Girl & the Goat. The food is quite tasty but the drinks are so-so with a minimal beer selection. I'm not really understanding the fancy diner theme. It is cute in a throw back hipster version of those awful 90's retro-50's diners but it is just a diner after all and I don't expect to pay that much for diner food even if it is uber tasty.
Wroth 30 mins wait for this diner place. I love how they made os waited at little goat bakery where you can buy their homemade product like sauces and some accessary. Love their marketing. Will be back.
"I would not recommend this place. The service was awful and the food was bad. The bus buys were the hardest working people in the place, while the wait staff stood around at the hostess table and talked the whole time. Our waitress barely came by to check in on us.  When our drinks were empty we put them at the end of the booth, and it still took the waitress who was 5 feet away talking to the other staff  20 minutes to provide refills. As far as the food, they are trying too hard to be fancy, and are over complicating flavors.  When our meals did come out, most of it was cold. I was very excited to go here for dinner, and disappointed to say that I will never be back and will strongly recommend to family and friends that they do not dine here as well."
"Pretty good but expensive.  For example, my second time around, I asked for a small glass so that I could pour milk that I brought for my son.  Instead, he brought out a tiny glass of milk.  Tiny as in 3 inches tall tiny.  I figured I'd just pay for it.  Bill came and that tiny milk was $3.75!  With tax and tip, that's $5.  Crazy for about 3 gulps of milk.  I had a coffee and two entrees between my wife and I with a side of fruit.  Total with tax and tip was close to $60.  Pretty pricey for brunch but like I said, it's pretty good."
"The Rooftop Bar is amazing. I love how it is totally acceptable that you could bring your family here and, unlike a lot of trendy food places, no one really minds. The chili cheese fries are to die for, the fried pickles were the best thing I've had fried in a long time (bread and butter genius), tThe pork belly pancake had great flavor (a little short on the pork belly) and the Beef Sandwich was incredibly tender. The Mac and cheese was killer as a big enough side for the table to share. The only thing I didn't love was the dish I ordered, the fish tostadas. They were OK. Could have used more depth of flavor."
"yes the waits are long. but they DO have a cool texting link that they text your phone with your wait time so you can leave and come back when you realize your turn is coming up.the place on the inside is very cool, nice decor.seems to be the ""it"" place right now, very trendy crowd.The menu had SO MANY options.  They did run out of Kimchee when we were there at like 7pm...which was a bummer.  The cheddar apple soup was AMAZING.  The fried pickle sandwich was gigantic but absolutely incredible.  And the blood orange pie?  Not too sweet and so delicious, we nearly licked the bowl.Service was stellar.i need to come back here and try brunch!"
"Another restaurant redeems themselves.  I avoided this place before due to a particularly poor experience my first time there.  In their defense, a lot of it was beyond their control, such as the air being out on a 100F day.  Regardless, I'm glad I came back.We were seated right away.  Hostess was friendly.  Waitress came to our table right away, gave us water and our menus, and asked us if we'd been there before.  Super friendly, asked if we had any questions, gave recommendations, the whole deal.Food was great for the most part.  I might take some heat for this, but I'd actually rather have the burger here than Au Cheval down the street.  Some of the other stuff we've tried before was hit or miss.Anyways, not to get into the details, but the service went far above and beyond anything I would have expected.  In a city where a good amount of the ""trendy"" restaurants treat you like you should be honored to be eating at their feet, it was refreshing to see.  The service, coupled with the fact that some of the menu items are absolutely fantastic, this place deserves a 5-star."
"Went here about a month ago for Sunday Brunch, place is legit. I had the tuna melt and my gf had the breakfast burrito. I would recommend both and then get one of the cocktails as well, they are really fresh."
"Avoid waiting in line and walk into Little Goat Bread, where you can pick up a quick sandwich, pastry or loaf of bread. Stopped in today and got an everything bagel with roasted cauliflower, cheddar cheese and scallion schmear. The bagel was different from the norm but still delicious. I absolutely love the cream cheese schmear as it reminded me of a veggie cream cheese pumped up with flavor. Can't wait to go back and try some more things!"
Great food - hearty modern twist on a variety of sandwiches and breakfast items. Nachos and the Crispy Chicken sandwich were awesome.Great atmosphere - sort of a hipster revival of a 70s diner. Good service.My only complaint: the AC kept the place about 5 degrees below where it should have been. Had to wear a hoodie on an 80 degree day.
"The restaurant atmosphere is kind of like an upscale diner, but the food is great!  We tried the veggie burger which was one of my favorite veggie burgers I've had at a restaurant: not too dry and nice flavor!  I also recommend the TIramisu milk shake which was delicious!  If you like ginger, they sell an amazing spicy ginger ale.  Best ginger ale I've ever had.  Definitely worth trying this place!"
"Some of the dishes are really good here. The beef sandwich or grilled cheese e.g. But I have a hard time with a number of things. What's with ""Sammiches"" on the menu? What are we, 7 year olds? That makes me think we are in for cutsiness not substance. Some of the dishes are just weird--bacon milkshake? Pork belly pancakes? And most are over priced. Everything is a la carte too, with servers trained to upsell. The entrees are large, so you don't really need that side of fried pickles and onions for $9. It's not that good anyway. The fried chicken looked good but if you want a biscuit with that it's  another $2. Bagel? OK but a smear is another $0.75. Again, some dishes are great. Probably because of all the cheese and frying and fat..oh..very noisy too if it's crowded. Hard to relax with that noise level. But if you don't mind overpaying for some of the unhealthiest dishes in the city at a restaurant run by one of the most overrated chefs in the country then by all means go. But just because it has goat or pork belly in it doesn't make it gourmet."
"Amazing. I am vegetarian and it had a great selection of food. SO TASTY. Very unique combinations. Service was fine. Veggy burger was delicious and the tempura mashed potatoes were a really cool side. Had the miso bloddy mary, awesome. Lived up to the hype. Went on a weekday so didn't have to wait."
"Working in the loops offers a lot of opportunities to try new places.  Yesterday, I had the opportunity to try this spot out on my lunch hour.  The staff was very friendly and greeted us right away.  The menu is filled with a nice variety of food choices. I decided to go out on the limb and try the Fish Tostados and I'm soo happy that I did. The fish was cooked to perfection and the shallot aioli . chickpea 'n onion salad . harissa vinaigrette complemented the fish perfectly.  There are so many items on the menu that I can't wait to try on my future visits. So many things sound delicious, such as the Grilled Cheese which is smoked gouda & mont amore cheese, sounds soo yummy! There is also a variety of sweets, salads, and breads that I'm hoping to try in the future.  This spot is definitely on my list to enjoy a nice meal anytime of the day in a great location."
"Came yesterday right before a Blackhawks game. It was a Monday late afternoon so wasn't super busy.  Got seated right away. Our server gave us plenty of time to look over the menu. (We were quite indecisive!) He also chatted and cracked a few jokes with us, which was nice. We ended up getting the hot crab dip with Ritz crackers. Soooo delicious! Was hot and bubbly when it came out. Do ask for more crackers - 8 is not enough. Mac 'n cheese was divine. Love the bread crumbs on top. And the Reuben sandwich. Very interesting taste with kimchi inside. All in all, a good ""diner"" experience! The bathrooms are really clean and nice, too."
"Get the Los Drowned. Then when the itis kicks in, pile a sugar rush with triple chocolate cookies from Little Goat Bread. Working in the West Loop has it's perks."
"Food was great, most of the staff was great, but our waiter was TERRIBLE. It was a busy morning, but he was completely checked out, forgetting to put in orders and bringing out single plates of food at random intervals. In all, after getting to our table and ordering right away, breakfast took nearly 2hr with the last (forgotten) plate coming out as we asked for the check -- seemed like every table around us was having the same experience.."
"couldnt get into G and G so came here.  Wasnt treated well at the reception desk but were finlly seated.  ok ambience. pseudo diner with a bar in the back and a bakery  too.  the service was slow and rather shoddy. the food was ok, but under seasoned and  really nothing remarkable. but the bill was remarkable.  I doubt i will be back. lots of better places in this price range."
"Some of the best food I have ever had. - affordable- great options for vegetarians :)- some of the drinks are delightfully boozy- big portions- service is great and staff is very accommodatingI had:hash browns (cheesy and just crispy enough)spiced apple pancakes  (not too sweet)wing burger with the veggie patty (best sandwich I have ever had)a whiskey drink If you are going to eat at once place in Chicago, it should be here."
"I've been to Little Goat for breakfast, lunch and dinner. I must say, everything I've ever had was DELICIOUS!!! Today, I enjoyed the french toast with fried chicken, UM YUM! and my family had the fish tostadas, smoked corned beef hash and the breakfast spaghetti. The service was on point and the food came out quickly, considering they were really busy. They do NOT take reservations, so expect to wait, unless you come during off peak times. The host staff was extremely friendly and kept me posted on my wait time, which I really appreciated. Usually hosts can be very obnoxious, but the ones here rock! I will definitely be back and would highly recommend to anyone looking for great food in a cool atmosphere. ENJOY!"
"LG is quite a little operation and I'm glad we went there for breakfast.  I had hash and my wife had bulls eye.  We were there early enough to sit outside on a beautiful morning.  I wandered around a lot while there and was impressed by the bar, bakery, cafe, & restaurant.  This is a cool place and most important the food is great.  The taste of the bulls eye was so awesome and Mandy was so happy to find an egg hidden in her french toast.  My hash was great and it's what I often order so I like to think I have discriminating taste.  I enjoyed twisting my fork in the stringed potatoes like it was spaghetti and grabbing egg, corned beef."
one word....delicious!!!
"I ate here again and I still don't get it.  I will give Stephanie Izard credit though for successfully duping most of Chicago into believing that this place is worth a 90 minute wait for very average food.  It's not bad, but it's not very good.  It's boring!!!"
We went for brunch and all I have to say is that this place is awesome.  Go!
"Awesome diner with a wide variety of choices.  Its a good breakfast alternative, and the lunch is great too."
"Wow, I was so excited to try and this and I could not wait to leave once we got there.1) Service was horrible, she had no suggestions or energy, forgot to put in an order and was extremely unhelpful.2) The food was either bad or blandchili - tasteless, no spice, blahchicken - again no seasoning, the coleslaw was beyond badfried pickles - way too much coating, but curry sauce was good.3) desert - decided not to stick around because we were already too annoyed4) 250 for 4 people for blah food, that was crazy.I love love love girl and the goat, this is nothing like it, the food is blah, but the prices are sky high. Very sad night."
"Fantastic hip restaurant in Chicago. Couldn't get into Girl and the Goat so we opted for the more casual version. Loved it. Great vibe, service and food. Living in CA I love the laid back non uptight restaurant - this fits the bill. Fresh made breads, great selection of foods. I had a pulled pork sandwich - sauce was just right - not mustardy or tart - very South Georgia smooth. Bread was outstanding.  Only complaint was they don't take reservations and it was about hour wait on a Thursday night."
Three Things: Pork Belly Pancake. Bulls Eye French Toast. The Fizz Cocktail. That is all you need to know about Little Goat. I come with my friends here and we consistently stay with these three items and the occasional special. The atmosphere is unreal. The decor is truly a modern take on the classic diner and the staff is so friendly. I have gotten the wonderful Jennifer as my waitress and her detailed recommendations and awesome attitude is truly fantastic!
"I've been to both the diner and cafe (Little Goat Bread) and I really like the spicy mayo shrimp with avocado & cheese cheese sandwich at the cafe. The diner food is good also but consists of heavier food choices. I did enjoy the los drowned sandwich, macho nachos, and smoked pork & toffee crunch shake at the diner."
"I have Celiac disease, so I am always looking out for gluten free brunch. They have sourdough pancakes, one extra star for that, but the pancakes were burnt. The hash browns were salty, I have had better hash browns. But they have a vast menu and my friend ordered Paratha Burrito, which he said was great. Overall a good experience. But, if going on weekend plan almost hour before because there is a long queue. Enjoy!"
"Brought our 3 kids here while visiting over spring break---we all loved it!  Food was delicious, server was attentive, great vibe & atmosphere."
"After lunch at Au Cheval, we stopped by here for a Double Espresso w/ Goat Milk; first time adding Goat Milk to coffee and man, it sure is tasty! It has a richer taste and a faint but lingering aftertaste, all Coffee Shops should have goat milk as an option in addition to soy and 2%. With the coffee, we also purchased a canister of the spice seasoning and coffee beans to bring home. There are jams too but we were not checking in luggage (we live in California) so next time. On the second time (next day) we purchased the double espresso again (less Goaty this time, but still good) and their beer bread (which was yeasty and springy in texture).  The double espresso is a drink we can have every day."
"I was in Chicago this past weekend.  Decided to get some breakfast since we were up so early. This was the only restaurant that was open at 8am. Food was amazing. I had the Healthy Goat. Yummy!  Tried the Elvis Breakfast. That was extremely rich. Try it. Oh, and one more thing, do not forget to order a mimosa."
"After two visits, I'm ready to weigh in.  You can still get a table here without a wait depending on the day, so that's a plus.  If you do have to wait, they take your phone number and text when your table is ready so you're free to roam Randolph Street in the meantime.  Service both times was impeccable.  They are definitely busy, so I appreciated the attentiveness with water refills and the friendly banter with the waitstaff.  I feel a little bad for the waitresses cause no one could look good in that diner-dress they wear!So far I've tasted the Goat Sloppy Joe, Los Drowned sandwich, Wing-style burger, mac and cheese, fried pickles, and blood orange meringue pie.  Mac and cheese was underwhelming but the Drowned and the Wing-style burger really stood out and made the meal.  I've had better fried pickles (ahem, Lillies Q) but the mustard they were served with and the onion rings made it a worthwhile choice.  Haven't tried any of the cocktails just yet, but the house cava was yummy and generously poured!Bottom line: Gourmet-Diner is an interesting concept and I guess I'm a fan.  Thankfully the gourmet price point will keep me from taking up residence in one of the cushy booths.  The menu offers some really wacky/tasty flavors though, so I will definitely be back to try brunch and the cocktails... and to revisit the wing-style burger.  It was soo good."
"What a disappointment. I love Stephanie I., her successes and her creativity, but I saw none of it here. Hostess was in a booth away from the door and eventually came to seat us at a table with 2 dirty water glasses, where she removed my 4 year old's silverware. He needs silverware.  We ordered for 4 of us and his milk came after one of us finished our breakfast. Waitress infamous with muffin selection. We were then told they were out of the muffin he ordered. My blueberry scone had fennel. Lots and lots of fennel. I hate fennel, and would have appreciated a warning. Food come out in 5 waves. Corned beef way too salty, but at least they let me sit for a long time with an empty water glass. Bathrooms were clean. I'm so sad."
"i came here with a dozen peeps, of whom all but two speak English as their native language. a variety of palettes spanning from eight different countries of origin came together to eat goat. impressively, the waiter fared well with all the different accents.i loved the atmosphere - a charming nouveau diner where you can dress chic or comfortable and not be out of place. well by comfortable i don't exactly mean sweat pants.at no point did our large table ever feel crammed - something i am always antsy of when dining out with groups; we were seated at a long skinny rectangular diner table made for a crowd. i could actually engage in conversation; music wasn't drowning anyone out. we all shared some appetizers: white mac n cheese that we loved so much we double dipped. fried pickles and onion rings with ranch and curry mayo - a good second. and then some macho nachos. plenty of appetizers to go around.we didn't need to start with a cup of bacon soup - i'll admit it's the one thing i'd pass on. i tried it more out of curiosity than anything else. if you think bacon is the gold trophy of food maybe you'd disagree. caleb finished mine for me.caleb and i came really hungry but after nibbling appetizers and a cup of soup we anticipated a filling dinner plate so we split a ""horseshoe burger"": an open face meat patty, topped with smoked fries, then goat chili and drizzled goat cheese. i am a lil apprehensive when it comes to chili but i was sold after one bite of this! the plate was huge so splitting was ideal for our tummies - it was hard to stop eating so splitting was great for quantity control.good beer there to pair with the meal: i started with the ""solemn oath"" imperial ipa and preferred my finish with the ""perrenial artisan ales"" farmhouse ale. too full to try dessert but i definitely will be back: for breakfast, dinner, and dessert for any excuse of an occasion!"
"It was just a - okay for me. I came to Little Goat for lunch. I came in and was greeted by a few hostess. I told one of them that I was there to meet a friend for lunch and that she's looking for a parking as we spoke. She told me that she can't seat me until the other party is here, which is fine BUT there were at least 6 open tables at that moment. I would understand if they were busy and I walked in without a reservation. I did not have a reservations but again, there were at least 6 open tables. Soon enough, the host who told me to wait went somewhere and another one came, she asked me if I have been helped and I told her that the other host told me to wait. This new host, gathered up two menus and told me that she's going to seat me anyways since they have a lot of open tables. Thank you very much.I sat and looked the menu right away. Everything looked delicious. Our server came by and greeted me. The same host who seated me approached me and asked me if I need her to lower the blind since the sun was directly shining on to my face. I said, yes please and she did just that, which I thought was very very nice of her. My friend came and we started ordering. I ordered the mocca with soy milk, Los Drowned and a side of mac and cheese, which my friend ordered the sloppy  goat and a side of fries. Soon enough, all our orders came except her sloopy goat. So, we asked the food runner to check on it. Later on, maybe about 5 minutes or so... Our server came to check in on us and we told her that we're missing the sloppy goat. She apologized and she told us that she heard the side of fries only and quickly put in her order. Minutes later, her food arrived and we ate in peace. I honestly didin't like my Los Drowned. There were not much flavors to me. I was expecting a little spice because of the spicy mayo being one of the ingredients and I did not taste that at all. I had two bites and asked for it to be wrap to go. My friend said, her sloopy goat was okay and ate more than half of it. I didin't try hers, so, I can't really say anything about it. However, the fries and the mac and cheese was heavenly. I thought they were really really good. We thought the place was decorated very nicely. I was very impressed at the decor and even the chairs for the long tables. It was very classy and I sure love the atmosphere. The music they were playing was really good as well. The manager came to greet us and asked us nicely how everything was. That was before the missing food and before we ate. So, we said, it was great! We thought our server was very nice and friendly at first but after the missing food part, we left like her friendliness was going short. I was quite disappointed at the whole experience because we were very excited to be there and just indulge in the yumminess but it didin't happen like that. I will however, come back for the bread."
"I was looking forward to checking this place out for months before it opened. Wasn't bad but wasn't a place I'd say I MUST return to.Busy on a Sunday night and there was a wait. Hostess sat us quicker than the time given. Our waitress was busy but was nice and helpful. Everything about all the staff was good!Food: I didn't order much because my eyes always seem bigger than my stomach. Started off with the Mac n cheese which was good (but can you really go that wrong on Mac?) my personal preference would have been more crunchy breadcrumbs. Then we order the smoked fries. Nothing special. Just tasted like regular fries. Think I was expecting something else. My friend order the fried pickle sandwich. She said it was pretty good and it looked great. My issue was the chili that I had maybe 4 bites of. Everyone has there own version of chili, mine was definitely not at little goat. The menu description of the chili was deceiving. I tasted either a lot of apples or apple cidar vinegar. Blahhhh!!!! in the description there was nothing about it that said sweet. I like a chili with a little spicy. Not one I feel like I'm dipping my apples in. Other than that, I'd go back to try the shakes but was just exhausted and had to leave. The only other thing I saw was   those uniforms!!!!!! Men wear jeans and a brown button up, as do the busers. Women on the other hand, have the most HIDEOUS diner dress with large puffy shoulders. Our waitress looked the most normal. Everyone else just looked uncomfortable. I thought one of the girls was the baker! What are you thinking little goat? I think it's all cute keeping with the diner theme but if that's the case I didnt know there were men servers at a diner. Just men cooks and busers. Let the women match the men and look a little more comfortable. Plus, those outfits aren't for everyone's body type!Hopefully one of these days the servers will all look the same. And I don't mean the men in diner dressers!!"
"Definitely a wait at 2:00pm on a Sunday (we were thinking we'd be after the brunch crowd, but thinking there's just always a crowd). We were told an hour, but it was shorter (closer to 45min) as we were willing to sit at a communal table. Little Goat is definitely loud and high energy, much like G&G with way less attention from the waitstaff than across the street. Our server was awkward and aloof, but also looked exhausted so we gave her a bit more patience. Love the refined, clever take on diner food and atmosphere as well as the extra special touch of the little goat on our napkin rings and plates. Sadly, they were out of the ""soda of the day"" which we were definitely excited for, but we moved on...We shared the crab dip which was just ""eh"". All were expecting way more crab than cheese, which was the opposite. It was hard to even tell there was crab in it. That being said, we were hungry enough that we did eat all of its cheesiness and asked for more crackers to finish it off. One friend had the fried pickle sammich, which looked super unique and had a happy eater enjoying it and the other had the BBQ pork sammich which was good, but not memorable or incredibly unique. Having not eaten white carbs in who knows how long, said friend was perfectly content inhaling the soft roll that came on top. My fish tostada officially goes on the list of things I will most certainly think about often and want to eat again with an Incredible balance of flavors and textures...perfect."
"Little Goat definitely has some kinks to work out, but since they are still so new I don't think they will have a problem doing so!  I'm still giving the restaurant four stars as there are so many things that I love about this place!Unfortunately it took my partner and I two visits to actually get the opportunity to sit down and try their food.  On the night prior to my birthday we went to Little Goat for dinner, but were told at the door that they were closing early due to the water being shut off on the whole block. It definitely bummed us out, but we stopped into Au Cheval and luckily they weren't experiencing any problems - which is weird as Au Cheval is literally on the same block as Little Goat, but I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.  On my actual birthday, the next morning, we decided to give the diner another try.  We got there around 1:00PM and it was packed, which we were expecting coming in around prime lunchtime.  They use a text messaging system for the wait list, which seems nice to most, but I personally didn't find it all that helpful.  I feel that it only made the hosts less personal - not remembering names and not genuinely listening to people's requests.  Also, you can track where you are at on the list by following the link onto the internet.  Our place in line changed frequently, somtimes decreasing and sometimes increasing - which was slightly mind-boggling.  We watched other parties go ahead of us that arrived after us, but we also understand that a party of three or four may be seated elsewhere than a party of two - so we didn't let that bother us much.  I was definitely getting antsy as we were quoted a half an hour and it was bordering one hour that we had already been waiting.  While I typcially don't mind waiting, my partner had to get to work and I also feel that the time quoted should be at least close to correct. We were finally seated an hour after we arrived at the counter facing the kitchen.  I felt that the counter was absolutely comfortable, being lower to the ground with comfortable stools and there was also a lot of counter space.  It was also exciting for us as Stephanie Izard was in the kitchen cooking right before our eyes.  Our server seemed a bit overwhelmed, but was still extremely nice and helpful.  We ordered Cheerwine to start off with.  While I have never had this soda before, my partner was oh so excited that they carried this drink as she has only seen it in the South.  For food, we asked for the Fried Pickles & Onion Rings as an appetizer and then the Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thing and the Spiced Apple Pancakes (with cream cheese butter and oatmeal crumble) as our main dishes to share between the two of us.  We received our two main dishes before the appetizer - actually, WAY before - as in we received our main dishes and then 30 minutes later, right before we were going to ask for the check, the appetizer then arrives.  We decided to just box them up and I said to my partner that the server must have mistakenly heard us say ""afterizer"" instead of ""appetizer"" - I was joking, of course.  As for the food...Kimchee & Bacon & Eggs & Pancakes - so eccentric and wonderful.  Neither of us had ever had anything like this dish before.  Typically I like my eggs with cheese, but this dish made me look at eggs a little bit differently and my love for cheese didn't even cross my mind.  It was refreshing and wonderful - I would recommend it to any outside of the box eater out there.  Spiced Apple Pancakes - were good, but not great.  While I enjoyed some aspects of this dish, I don't think I would order it again.  My best bites had a good amount of the oatmeal crumble on them, but there were many bites that were simply just ""meh.""  My partner said she wished there was more of the cream cheese butter on the pancakes, but she also said she didn't taste any type of spice flavor and I agreed.  Fried Pickles and Onion Rings - were... fried pickles and onion rings - how can you go wrong with this one? Unfortunately, we didn't get to eat this dish right after it was prepared as it was delivered to us right before we were about to leave, but even as we ate them later on, at home, they were good! They are served with curry mayo and ranch - which I loved.  I love onion rings and my partner loves pickles so it was kind of a must get in our books.  Maybe it wasn't the best combination with our breakfast choices, but really, who cares?  As I sat and looked around I was just enamoured - the design of everything from the booths, the counter in front of the kitchen, the bar in Little Goat Bread (beside the diner), and even the windows on the ceiling in the middle of the room - it was all just wonderful and homy. Plus, any place that plays at least one Fleetwood Mac song while I'm there is a winner in my book!  I'll definitely be back, but maybe at a less busy hour - in an attempt to avoid mistakes and slightly frantic workers."
"Little Goat, as the name would suggest, is Izard's more casual restaurant.  The restaurant has a diner theme to it and serves many diner classics with a serious Stephanie Izard twist.  I thought that the food at Little Goat was the perfect example of how simple, comfort food, when done right, can totally constitute a great dining experience.  Also, while a more casual restaurant, Little Goat takes service seriously.  My waiter was both knowledgeable about menu items and was friendly, funny, and made us feel welcome.  On my first trip here, I went the dinner route (Fried Chicken, Pork Belly Pancake, Goat Chili), but I can't wait to come back for dinner. For my full review, check out my blog post: youngfoodies.com/restaur…"
"We went to Little Goat last weekend for Brunch and I cannot wait to go back. There were 6 of us and I was dreading an hour plus wait for what I assumed would be an over-hyped breakfast. The hour flew by, particularly with the entertainment of following our names on the list via the texted link when we checked in. They are set up perfectly for groups of 6 with large booths lining the restaurant. I personally enjoyed the Fat Club sandwich (drooling just thinking about it). Other hits at the table included the mac n' cheese (seriously the best I've ever had), the Elvis waffles, and the spiced apple pancakes. In addition we took home a loaf of the broccoli cheese bread from the bakery... a must! It's amazing. My husband and I fought over a piece of it just this morning. Do go here and enjoy. Great food, good prices, can't wait to go back."
"I wish I could have given this place a better rating because the food is amazing but the service is some of the worst I've had.I don't mnd waiting for a table and understand that busy hours = a lot of work but I felt like our server kept forgetting that we were her table. The first dish was brought to our table. We were done eating by time our server came over the explain to us what sauces were served with it... we had to ask for refills on coffee. If my glass is clearly empty I'm not sure why I need to ask if I can have more. Then our entrees came... well all but one. The other food was cold by time the missing dish came. With no apology or explnation. We sat and waited then she came to our table with a confused look and said, ""Oh..."" then walked away.I would love to come back and try other things on the menu because everything We tried was great but I feel like lunch shouldn't take 2 hours from beeing seated to paying our bill. Its seems that I've talked to other people who have had the same things happen... even walking out after sitting at their table for 30 minutes without even getting a menu.I feel like their poularity is maybe getting to their heads because I think when someone walks about after not being waited on and you ask, ""How was everything?'' and they tell you they weren't served maybe you should atleast say you're sorry. I'd go back for the breads, which were pretty good but not the airhead service."
Who wouldn't give this place a five star just to be there...just the thought of a swanky diner around the corner makes the day brighter. Sometimes servers get busy...but they always tell you about it. My recent fav is the tostadas...and of course the machos nachos. Food is way too much for two. But i dnt mind packing some of those for my sunday breakfast :)
"Pretty disappointing ... and I'm a huge Girl/Goat fan.Table and booth seats dirty when we sat, drinks took 20 mins to serve - too long, no food stood out as exceptional or even something we would eat again.  All American burger was cooked well but under-seasoned, special sauce was skimpy and the tomato was too small to notice.  Tempura batter on pickles and onions was good but needed seasoning and onions we're too thin to taste.  Fried pickle sandwich a great idea but ended up having way too many things going on to be good.  Boo Boo Baise OK - but menu sounded better than the real thing.  Mac and cheese OK - seemed a bit watery and cheese grits were pretty stiff.  Will not waste my money again - really sorry this was not a better experience."
"A souped up Spanish omelet, a different but dry fig and pepper scone and the average cup of Joe from a very above average looking bakery is the basis of this review... But as first impressions go, I was disappointed with the more accessible but less impressive of the two Izard establishments on Randolph.This is certainly no average diner menu.. there is a certain universal appeal to the creative "" cereal killers"" list - kimchee, paratha, rich pancake variations offer up some promising fusion possibilities, but it does make for a bit of a pricey profusion of scattered options especially if one is looking for a typical early Saturday vegetarian brunch.The wait was expected, bread and people watching at the adjoining bakery is a great way to wait for your turn! My friend and I got a great spot at a sun drenched booth on the far end of the diner - very glad that the typical diner ambiance wasn't kept true to form!It was not entirely a case of much ado about nothing but there certainly was less fire than I expected underneath all that smokey buzz!"
"I want to focus a short review on the service: Our server was great, attentive, friendly, knowledgeable and helpful with ordering and explaining the various items. Also got an inedibly salty (and too-small-for-the-price) fried chicken comped for us with a replacement.However, the busers are WAY too aggressive. One review below mentions asking if a plate could be 'taken out of [her] way' while she still had a forkful of it mid-air -- and we had the same experience. An unfinished bowl of the smoked fries was whisked away along with other empty plates, for example; and the busers came more and more frequently and insistently the more we sat there -- so we felt guilty lingering and trying to catch up with our good friend, which is not the kind of restaurant I want to eat at. I totally understand they have to turn tables, but as far as I'm concerned, just be upfront and say you have people waiting, instead of playing good cop (server) bad cop (bussers) passive-aggressively.And this is hardly the only restaurant that does this (Yusho, Au Cheval -- I'm looking at you). It just totally ruins the social experience of dining with someone when you're reminded so often that you're basically an unwanted squatter.Is there any way to stop this business practice? (I know, complaining on Yelp won't do it. But it does give me a way to vent!)"
"One word to describe: Overhyped.+Was it worth the 60 minute wait? No+Would I come back here again? Maybe- there are better brunch options+Of the Bulls Eye French Toast, the Los Drowned or the Mac n' cheese, which was best?  Mac n' cheese - and I think that says something when the side dish is better than the entrees. The french toast and chicken were cooked fine, but the egg inside the toast, not so much. It was so runny the egg white was still clear around the yolk. I showed my neighbor as we sat in the community table and he hoped for my benefit that the egg was from a reputable source (I'm pretty sure it was, like 95.8% sure...eeek?). Also, there seemed to be a smidge of curry I think in the batter, which I didn't mind. The Los Drowned was a good sammy, like a French dip with cheese, avocado, and mashed up black beans on the bottom and au jus to dunk in. The mac n' cheese was creamy and sharp, it tasted like it might have had goat cheese in it. As we later found out in talking to our neighbors, it seemed each of the items they had (the dudes to my left had onion rings and fried pickles, and the guys to my right had hash browns with a fried egg) that one or another of their items have either curry or goat cheese. I sense a theme?+How is the coffee? I got the Little Goat coffee. Espresso with goat milk and whipped cream and a caramel drizzle. Was good, but the large had way too much milk to espresso ratio (you'll need at least 3 shots if you get the large, as the standard offered is only 2). And the goat milk does have a distinct flavor, so if you're into chevre, go for it!+How is the bread? Yum, all of it, get some!! +How is the decor?  It's pretty inside- actually reminds me a little of Maude's Liquor Bar down the street, with the white subway tile and white hexagon mosaic tile... very modern and elegant without being stark as it's offset by reclaimed wood and old school light fixtures and a large french style mirror (in the bakery above the bar). And the centerpiece light fixture suspended from the skylight of the diner was purdy too. +Service? Eh.. Our server was nice but we didn't get any refills on water, our to-go boxes on time and we got overcharged by $20 on my husband's credit card. They fixed it but that definitely did not add to the experience. Overall, food and service just ok."
"Stopped in the other day for a late brunch and let me just say, Stephanie Izard should probably be known as King (Queen?) Midas, as everything she touches turns to gold.  An hour plus wait at 2:00 on a Sunday...who else can do that? At least she knows her shizz.  I love Girl and the Goat and Little Goat lives up to its namesake.  As a fiend of fried food, I was hard pressed to order anything on the menu other than the Bulls Eye French Toast.  Fried chicken...good.  French toast...good.  BBQ maple syrup...good.  Surprise eggs in the middle of said french toast...not quite what I was expecting (though, duh, bulls eye).  At any rate, I'm not a huge lover of eggs, so I was a little wah wah about the eggs.  They were very easy to pick around though, so it hardly ruined the dish for me.  The rest of it was awesome.  My sister ordered the tuna melt, which was slightly different from your average tuna melt - topped with a Nicoise style salad, but it was delish.  I snuck a few bites after she was full and could have snuck a few more if I wasn't so stuffed myself.  We got an order of the smoked fries to share and they were pretty good as well.  The first couple of fries had me thinking, hmm, how do they get the smokey flavor but after that they were just damn good.  Oh, and the bloodys, how could I forget those!  One of the better bloody mary's I've had.  Spicy, clean and refreshing.  Yes please, I'd like another.  My sister is is in the service industry and knew some pretty important people here...so many that we got free desserts: the choco taco and the smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake.  The choco taco was sour cream ice cream with some chocolate covered potato chips.  It was weird but it worked for me.  The milkshake...well it tasted good, bacon-y and weird, but good, until the server said it was made with pork fat ice cream.  Now I love bacon as much as the next guy, but there's something a little wrong about indulging in a dessert that is mainly made up of pork fat.  A few sips was more than enough.  Overall, a solid outing and I look forward to coming back.  I'm sure I'll be stopping in for some bread sooner rather than later as well."
"Seriously, this place is no big deal.  It's a high priced greasy spoon.  Food is decent, but not what you'd expect from the brains behind the Girl & The Goat across the way.  That alone will keep the place packed and the wait long, but do yourself a favor and find somewhere else to dine if you are expecting to be ""wow'd"".  If you want a simple, maybe boring meal then this is the place."
"Best brunch of my life!  We had the indian flatbread and the french toast with chicken.  Both dishes were out of this world.  Price, portion, atmosphere, service were all perfect!  While I wish they took reservations, I like their texting program so you can see where you are in line and how much longer you have to wait.  Very thoughtful restaurant!"
"Good drinks. Great ingredients in the food. But if you are looking for intense flavors in the food, you probably wont get it. I loved the chickpea and kale salad with smoked salmon - highly recommend, great mix of ingredients."
What's not to love?  Everything you need from a diner and want from a a top chef. This place is an amazing combo.
"My favorite place to eat in the city. Had the tuna melt and it was so delish. I've been about 5 times and have never been disappointed. Went on a bad date there, at least the food was good!"
"I went today for a late lunch with my fiancée. I agree with many of the other reviews that the text message notification for tables is a cool and useful touch.While waiting, we went to the bar and had a latte. The coffee from Stumptown was goooooooooood :)After being seated (nb that we were at a communal table) our waitress came over. She was really friendly and helpful. She obviously knew the menu and offered some good tips.Onto the food......this was the underwhelming part...:(I guess our expectations were high since we had eaten a few times at Girl and the Goat.We ordered the goat sloppy joe and the pork belly Asian pancake. Neither were amazing. The pork belly had a number of flavor profiles that didn't sit harmoniously and the sloppy joe was surprisingly under seasoned and bland.I like the concept, but would not bother to wait for an hour for this food....next time it will be a quick stop for coffee and bread."
"Met a friend here for lunch at 12:30 and we were prepared for the 30 minute wait for a table.  No problem there.  After being seated we were given menus, and ordered our drinks.  The nice server came back and took our order after about 5 minutes, and my friend's order for a craft beer.  Fifteen minutes after that the server returned with the info that they were out of the beer, would she care for another choice?  After some discussion she ordered an alternate choice, and we mentioned that we were plenty hungry.  About 10 minutes later he arrived with her beer and a refill on the iced tea -- now a half hour has passed since we ordered two sandwiches.  a little more than 10 minutes after that we received our sandwiches.  I get the wait to be seated, but I don't understand a 40+ minute wait for food after ordering.The big upside is that the food was delicious, and since we were seated along the far wall we could hear each other talk and had a lovely time visiting.  Also a plus that they offer valet parking which is great for a place on that restaurant strip during the day.  The Banh mi was wonderful with just enough heat, and the Fried Pickle and Onion sandwich was really a layered vegetarian concoction on flat bread -- unusual and very tasty.  So, popular, great food, and enh service."
"I had a few friends in town and we decided to hit up Little Goat for Breakfast on Monday morning.  It was surprisingly busy for a monday morning.We ordered the Bulls eye French Toast, the Corned beef Hash and the Shrimp and grits.  All were well prepared and delicious.  My Bulls eye French toast would have been better if the syrup was on the side.  It did get a little too sweet after a while.The atmosphere is a fun open environment with a retro diner-esque look.The waitress was knowledgable and friendly, but the service was a little on the slow side.I will come back to try the lunch, it looks good."
"Using a week of vacation to check out places around the city that are super hard to get into on the weekends payed off today! Dined solo at Little Goat and had the fun of sitting at the counter where I got to see many of their dishes as they went into the window form the kitchen. Some of them looked so good I feared that I may have ordered wrong (I will definitely order the tempura mashed potatoes next time!)Started out with a Little Goat to drink which sounded different and I like different, I also like caramel and this was prepared with caramel, and steamed goats milk (note to self: try more goats milk) and masala? spices. Got a large, I could've taken a dip in it...Next up the ooey gooey cinnabun (mostly ordered it because the menu states you gotta get there early and apparently I was there early enough that getting one wasn't an issue, I'm guessing they have a limited number of these each day...) when it arrived I almost panicked because it was huge and I was alone but it turned out to be surprisingly light for a cinnamon bun. Th icing had a nice tang to it (goat's milk again? Hmm...) and the center of the bun had a nice big cinnamon surprise.I had to think long and hard to choose my main course and debated heavily between the breakfast spaghetti, the brandade and eggs, and the corned beef hash. My server, Patrick, helped me narrow it down with a good description of the spaghetti and brandade but after seeing a few plates of hash leave the kitchen I feel he sold that one a bit short when he described it to me. I will definitely be back though and the hash is on my short list of things to try. I ultimately chose the brandade and although I wasn't sure I was going to like it (house made biscuit topped with pork belly, fried eggs, kale, kimchi and pickled peppers with a very saucy brandade) I pretty much had my mind blown after the first bite. I would HIGHLY recommend this dish although it's definitely not for the faint of heart. The biscuit was AMAZING. I would possibly kill for that recipe... the pork belly was a nice thick cut, tender inside and crispy outside, good flavor and just salty enough. I can only assume that the kimchi was housemade and it was just right, not too spicy, not too salty, not too pungent. The kale was a nice touch, I don't remember it being in the menu description but I was certainly not disappointed to see it on my plate. Pickled peppers again a nice counterpoint to the rich brandade. The BRANDADE though... oh my. I've had brandade several times at several different places and it kinda just always the same, it's salt cod, potatoes, butter, etc but the brandade here at Little goat was delicious unlike any I've had before. Not sure if there was secret extra ingredients or if it was just better prepared or even just that it went so well with everything on the plate but I thoroughly enjoyed it. I tend to order like a food critic, always looking for things that sound like they are going to fall flat due to the chef overreaching and sometimes I'm right nad they suck but at other times they turn out to be heavenly. For all of the craziness happening on my plate it somehow all wen together perfectly and I was very happy with my experience. Can't wait to go back, Little goat certainly deserves all of the accolades they have received."
"For vegans and for those looking to eat more plant-based meals, there is a full secret vegan menu that for some reason is not really advertised. At first glance, it looks boring (kale & chickpea salad, taco salad, etc), but it is so much more flavorful, complex, and interesting than it lets on! For example, I ended up getting the kale and chickpea salad with chickpea fritters and pickled onions in lemon-kimchi vinaigrette. Best salad of my life. My friend got the taco salad, which was mind blowing as well. This might be the best vegan meal I've had in recently memory!"
Can't wait to go back and try the sandwiches!
"Where do I begin?  Diner heaven. Comfort food with amazing twists. Great vibe. Good service and amazing food. I sat at the counter and watched countless creations come out of the kitchen.  We were only 2 people,which limited what we could try. Portions are big. After much debate we went with Tonkatsu pork sandwich and Torpedo french toast. Best french toast I have ever had. Runny egg inside with crispy fried chicken breast pieces and maple syrup. I cannot wait to go back and try 10 more items. Run,don't walk to this place!"
"Great food, service, atmosphere, and location. Eat here!!"
"There are many, many wonderful things about this restaurant.  The food was fantastic.  I had the pork belly pancake, loved it!  The bacon and toffee milkshake is amazing.  There's so many interesting combinations and fun choices on the menu, the kind of place where you want to keep coming back so you can try everything.  Even the kids menu pancakes were delicious, my son scarfed them up.  The beer list is respectable, but I think a little bit snobby with the glassware and smaller sizes for the same price as a pint.The only complaint I had is that we happened to go on one of the recent crazy July heatwave days and the A/C was completely ineffective.  You could tell it was running flat out - the building was shaking from it, but there was no air flow or cool temps to be had anywhere in the dining room.  I've never sweat so much eating a meal."
"Just had lunch there, lets start with the food I ordered the kimchi, egg, bacon, pancake 'tasty thingy' which sounded interesting and the server sold me on it and not to mention I'm a big fan of Korean food. One word SODIUM....wow I must of had three glasses of water to rinse this puppy down. Did i mention it was cold. My coworker ordered the Hashbrown and eggs, nothing to jump about, to sum his review I quote him ""I had better for less"" not to mention we were still hungry. The service was slow took 35 minutes to get the order out, I will not put this down as a breakfast spot. Being only a couple weeks Open, I will give it one more try for lunch..until then."
"The fanciest and best diner I have ever had the pleasure of dining in. My friend and I went here for dinner and got some pretty strong cocktails in the back while waiting for our table. We ordered the goat chili cheese fries as an appetizer and I almost died of happiness. It wasn't a lump of greasy flavorless chili--it was arguably one of the best chilis I have had. The goat gave the whole thing a new flavor. I was told to order a goat kimchi burger next time, but that night I had the kimchi pork chop and my friend ordered the kalbi. Amazing! Not sure why we thought it would be a good idea but instead of a regular side, we just decided to order shrimp cocktail, which was served as a lettuce wrap. Very cute and very tasty. It wouldn't have been a diner without some blueberry pie for dessert, which is worth the trek to the West Loop just on its own."
"Oh Stephanie Izard, you have done it again! I have been a huge fan of Girl and the Goat since it opened and was not disappointed with it's new sister Little Goat.Went to Little Goat on a Tuesday night around 6pm and surprisingly no wait for a table of two. We ordered the fish tostadas and the ""fat club"" sandwich, both of which were great. The fish tostadas were my favorite, the homemade tortilla chips were super crispy and I could have eaten more of those on their own. The dessert menu is also not to be missed, we ordered the choco taco and peppermint patti sundaes, both were very unique. The choco taco was made with sour cream ice cream and had layers of chocolate taco pieces. I loved the taco pieces but was not sure I really love the taste of sour cream in ice cream. The peppermint patti sundae had a Vietnamese chocolate ice cream that was somewhat spicy, layered with chocolate cake and chocolate fudge. Again, the ice cream choice was somewhat strange and the spicy aftertaste was not something I was expecting, but the chocolate cake layers were amazing. I think they should start selling slices of that great cake!The best thing about Little Goat is definitely the variety and uniqueness of items on the menu. There are so many things to order, I can't wait to come back and try more things, especially for brunch!"
"Ugh Little Goat, I wanted to love you so much. My friend and I split the grilled cheese, some other un memorable sandwich, the mac and cheese and the onion rings and pickles. The onion rings were the best thing. The grilled cheese was so bad, it had greens in it and the cheese they used made it taste bitter. How do u mess up a grilled cheese! Im also a mac n cheese snob and this just had no flavor. I would go back but my friend who I went with recently went back and said it was equally as disappointing. Oh well I guess Ill just have to wait 3 months to get a reservation at girl and goat because that is really delic!"
"I Love Love Love The Little Goat Cafe!  I'm not sure where to begin. The food is incredible. Service is always great.  Interesting food combinations and everything is incredible.  I've had burger, french toast and chicken, goat chili, the smoke fries.  Seriously everything is delicious!  Yes there can be a a wait but if go during off hours you can normally get in without a wait.  We tend to eat late and the best part is the kitchen is open until 1am!  We've stopped in after a late Hawks game!  I highly recommend it!!"
"Very much admire the fact that this hipster diner has some unusual combinations and ingredients.  Unfortunately, nothing (except for the pork toffee milkshake) was any good - the cocktails were poorly balanced; all fried elements to the food were soggy; the pork belly pancake had mediocre meat and a rancid taste to the pancake, and two of our party suffered gastric distress through the night."
"My husband and I are huge brunch fans and really enjoyed Girl and the Goat, so eating at Little Goat has been on our ""to do list"" for a while. What a disappointment! First we got there and was told it would be an hour wait....that very slowly turned into over 2 hour wait! We kept being told ""15 more minutes""...very frustrating.  Coffee was amazing, good baked goods but the food was ""just ok"". He had the Berandade Biscuits and I had the Spanish omelette  which were  both fine, but not amazing. Our table shared the dark chocolate chips pancakes which were good...but you put chocolate, syrup and butter together and it should be. Our friend got the pork belly pancake which was pretty good too. Overall the food was not worth the wait and we will probably not be going back anytime soon."
"Loved!!  What a fun brunch, the wait was a tad long... but we went into that knowing we'd be in for a long haul.  That is where the coffee bar comes,in handy- to snack on something before you eat. The service was great- and we were able to avoid a community table- a huge plus in my book. We went a little overboard and a brunch for 4 ppl. was about 160.00 but I wouldn't change a thing. I can't I wait to go back."
"Seeing is believing.  Nooooo.  Eating is believing. This spot is the Bomb.  My daughter And I met here after work for a bit to eat.  Got there and low and behold, breakfast, lunch, and dinner were on the menu.  WOW. Impressive, but just ordered great burgers.  The Mushroom and BBQ Pork sandwiches.  They were AMAZING. Before that,  we ordered fresh chips w/mega toppings. AaaaaaweSsssome. After that,  we ordered Passion Pie and Turtle Pie which were To Die For.  One more thing is, the server we had named TIFFANY was just as GREAT as the food.  She was super fast kind. WE Angie And Laura nominate TIFFANY as One of  Chicago's Very Own."
"Fantastic. The wait staff was incredible, especially Ezra. Probably the best waiter I've had in Chicago. We'll be back for sure."
"OMG Stephanie Izard opened a diner!!! She's all the rage, the Boka Group is all the rage, and diners are all the rage!!! How can this place fail? Bottom line - looking at the bulk of the reviews on Yelp, failure is not possible. But here's the thing. The waits are ridiculous. And while I initially thought that was simply due to popularity, after eating here I learned that it is just as much a result of ridiculous pacing (LONG break between appetizers and entrees and and again before dessert) and slow, slow service. We got our fries when we had about a bite left in our burgers, and my shake had melted to the point of being a really cold glass of chocolate milk by the time it was delivered.More on the food. The burger was very good, the fries were okay but not crisp, and the pancakes were over-the-top sweet. No need to say much more.Clearly plenty of people love this place. I'm happy they're happy. And I'm happy I won't be back."
"I love The Girl and The Goat, so I decided to try this place out.I went here for brunch on a Sunday and I was sat at the end of the counter. Normally I do not mind sitting at a counter, but I was right near the area where they drop dirty plates and it was extremely loud. Also, towards the end of my meal water leaked all over the floor  in that area and the manager pulled a trash bin of dirty used napkins right in front of me so he could use the napkins to try to mop up the water on the floor. I really don't understand why he thought putting a trash can in front of a customer while they were eating was appropriate, even if the bin did not have trash in it.I like the fact that they have a separate gluten free menu, but that's about it. I ordered the GF pancakes and cheesy grits. The pancakes were decent. The grits were not good at all. They were not consistently cooked throughout, as if they had not been stirred while they were cooking and overall were undercooked. I most likely will not return, it wasn't worth the trip."
"Excellent food, on point service. The pulled pork might be the best sandwich I've ever had."
"Awful! Just awful! Where do I start.... We sat at the counter... no big deal... I enjoy the counter. At LG, my husband and I had a front row seat to a disaster! Food sat waiting to be taken to tables for a LONG, LONG time. It was total chaos. Fries -- cold and tasteless. Zero flavor. Frozen fries from Jewel taste better. The cold factor can be explained by the food just sitting for an unreasonable amount of time on the expo line. Mac and Cheese - could of fooled me... it was more like mashed potatoes. The noodles were SO over done - they were just mush. The cheese was gritty - like powdered cheese out of a box. The flavor was also completely tasteless. Burger - ordered it medium - got well done - almost burnt. Again, complete tasteless. No flavor. Dried out beef. It was the Korean burger so I was expecting a little flavor, instead, I got over cooked, dried out, tasteless card board disguised as beef. I am a huge dessert lover; however, after the disappointment of the main courses, we skipped the dessert. From what I could tell by looking around... dessert looked like store bought ice cream scooped into a sundae bowl. I LOVE GG - however, this little project of Ms. Stephanie's has failed miserably. Talk about a fall from grace. Save yourself a few bucks (actually more than a few bucks - a lot of bucks) and hit up a bar on Madison - you'll get better ""diner style"" food for a much LOWER price."
"Yum to the max --almost everything here is DELICIOUS. I'm bizarrely obsessed with the falafel kale salad (I know, who tries to eat healthily at a place like this?!)My only tiny criticisms are (1) the coffee is terrible (2) the mac'n'cheese is just ok (to be fair I'm a self-confessed fanatic so I'm a tough critic to please in this department)"
"I love Girl and the Goat and was super excited to try the Little Goat. The place is so cute. A nice looking diner with a modern feel. We ordered macho nachos, Asian shrimp salad, goat sloppy joe, and fried pickle sandwich. Nachos took about 15 min to come out, but were delicious. Home made chips, fresh ingredients, yumm. Everything else came out shortly after and was just okay. Pickle sandwich was good, not great. Sloppy joe was a little dry. Asian salad was missing something. It was bland. Will most likely try it again."
"Little Goat, oh, Little Goat. I really wanted to like you but you disappointed me.A friend of mine and I came in on Friday night around 7:15. The place was crowded and we had about a 30 min wait. Not bad! We weren't starving so we decided to grab a drink at the bar. (On a side note I thought it was very cool that they text you when your table is ready.) The bar area is a little small because it's a combo bar, store, and coffee counter. Different but I'll go with it. We finally got a table and ordered food. My friend got the salad and I got the chili with a side of roasted root veggies. We also shared the blood orange meringue for dessert. The food was good but that's where it ends. We sat at a table by the bathroom but you wouldn't know it because the door to the bathrooms blend in with the wall. Whaaat?!? Why wouldn't you want people to know where the bathrooms are?? There isn't even a sign. Nope, not one indicator. One of the bus boys was basically directing people all night. And at one point I even told someone walking by that yes that was the door to the bathroom.When we were done I paid for the meal with my credit card and our server came back saying the card was declined. The error message was something related to ""batch full"" or something along those lines. My girlfriend owns a bike shop and told him that there wasn't anything wrong with my card, it was a problem with their system and they needed to batch out all the transactions from earlier in the day. After he talked to the manager, he came back and said indeed there was a problem with their credit card machine. So we waited... he came back about 20 min later and told us it was still down so we waited some more... 20 min later he stopped by and asked if we needed anything and apologized for the wait but the machine was still down. So we waited even more... at one point my friend and I heard a waitress tell the table next to us that the machines are down and the couple got up and left. I asked my friend if they paid or if they just got a free meal? Neither of us knew for sure. That's when our waiter finally came back and said they would have to use a manual machine to run my credit card. Really?! Um, ok. We ended up being there for 2 hours and 45 minutes and wasn't offered anything for having to sit there and wait for their credit card machine snafu. It was a little disappointing that we were inconvenienced like that and they didn't do anything to rectify the situation. As I said, the food was alright but I won't be coming back here."
"Oh me oh my! We were seated immediately at 10:00am on a Saturday, which is a GREAT start to brunch!  The place has fantastic ambience, and there was clearly plenty of thought and creative energy put into the design and flow here.  But about the food... I'd heard a few people say 'well, it's ok' or 'weeelllll, the portions are ok', but I quickly found the truth is that Little Goat serves huge, fresh-out-the-oven plates of awesomeness without fail.  The menu is easy to navigate, and there are plenty of options for both the breakfast/brunch traditionalist and for those more adventurous souls.  Our first round of bloody marys were exceptional, and just strong enough to leave me considering whether I actually needed another, and the spicing was spot on.  Our food portions from the brunch menu were fairly large.  What really hooked me was the foods' synergy.  My kimchi delicious breakfast thing looked great on the menu, smelled great on my plate, but the taste was otherworldly when all of the ingredients came together in one bite.  Without drinks, you could eat here for around $25.  But come on, it's brunch!"
"My friend who was visiting from NYC and I came here on a Sat morning around 10am for brunch.  Having eaten at Girl & The Goat across the way, I had high hopes.... It pains me to write this, but it's the truth.We had the:- Smoked Corn Beef Hash With Eggs (kinda underwhelming)- Sloppy Goat (much better!)- Stumptown Coffee (best!)Pros:- Decor & Design- Taste & variety of food- Food was served very quickly- Price is much more affordable than Girl & The Goat- Estimated wait time: 1 hr, we sat down in 45mins- We got seated at our own 2 person table, not the bar or communal table- Bakery & Bar next door: friendly service and tasty pistachio bread- The coffee I ordered at brunch was not on the bill (perhaps mistakenly or due to lack of service??)The major and only con: THE WAITRESS- our waitress was lacking SO terribly on service!!!! - the man with the water came and filled us up, then left without saying a word- after 10 minutes of waiting, we flagged down a host to say we were ready to order, who then went to find our waitress- a few minutes later, she appeared, quickly apologized and asked if we were ready to order- food came, and the waitress asked how the food was, when both of us JUST got the food and didn't even unwrap our utensils yet. we said we'd let her know how the food was after we tasted it (passive-aggressive much?)- she never checked back in, but did refill my coffee once- we had to flag her down, AGAIN, for our bill- she made our adventure so much worse. if only we had a different server!! she is just terrible. the only damper on our whole weekend.I am giving Little Goat a second chance when my family will be visiting, so let's hope we will not get the same waitress!!!!  I also have Mother's Day reservations for Girl & The Goat (which has superb service), so I am banking on that if Little Goat fails me again.  : ("
Went a few months ago but just posting the review now. Their goat chili is the best ever. Got the kimchi burger and wife got the breakfast spaghetti. Both were just ok and I think there were just too many flavors competing with each other in the dishes. Their bloody mary is one of the best in the city.
Loved the upscale innovative diner type experience. 3 of us all loved our sandwiches for lunch. We got sat in 10 minutes around 11:30 on a thursday which was nice. Great service. We will be back
Cool place. Great food. Total lack of hospitality. They clearly do not need or care for my business.
"I'm giving it 4 stars because the food was outstanding. I would really like to give it 3 stars for the hostess stand/wait time. The food: I had the Los Drowned sandwich and it was awesome. All the flavors just worked. It's huge so I only ate half and took the other half home (husband was lucky enough to get it for his lunch today). My husband had a patty melt which he said was one of the best he has had in a long time. My cousin had the Parathas Burrito which was also so good! We all shared an order of the smoked fries. I would recommend all the dishes we ordered and would get them again.The wait: We arrived on a Saturday morning just before 10 am. We put our names down (party of 3) and were told 45 minutes. Ok not that bad. Went next door to the very cute bakery where we grabbed a coffee and a coffee cake and proceeded to wait...and wait...and then wait some more. 45 minutes after we initially checked in I went to the hostess stand to get an update, she looked for me name and then said ""it'll be 45 minutes..."" Wait. What? You said 45 minutes, 45 minutes AGO. She double-checked her little screen and said oh sorry, just give me 15 minutes...well, 45 minutes LATER we were finally seated. Long waits are kind of annoying but what is more annoying is when the wait time is DOUBLE the time you are quoted...it was a lazy Saturday (and it also happened to be my birthday) so we were sort of ok just lounging around waiting but no one acknowledged or apologized for the delay...I definitely want to go back but it'll have to be on another day when I have hours to waste just waiting...unfortunately, those are few and far in between."
"After an hour wait, my fiancee and I were ready to try this infamous eatery. We ordered the Korean burger and the bull's eye french toast. The waitress recommended that we order medium for the burger -- which we did. Unfortunately, it was well done instead. The sauce on the burger was good however we did not like the cabbage. Overall, the burger was very messy to eat and did not live up to our expectations. The bull's eye french toast was good however the egg yolk was definitely runny even after confirming with the waitress that it would be over medium. The rest of the french toast was good."
"We finally had a chance to be in the city on a weekday lunch hour so of course we decided to b-line it to Little Goat to try this Izard establishment... It was stupendous!First off we tried the tiramisu shake and the cookie shake. The cookie shake came with the hat of whip cream that you expect with a proper milkshake whereas the tiramisu shake came with a scoop of.. wait for it.. mascarpone chese mix stuff... that was topped with some toothsome chocolate cereal (most def made in house) that was TO DIE FOR. Great start. My friends tried the coffee with the goat milk... yea good coffee but goat vs cow milk in coffee doesnt really allow for our 'untrained' palates to taste the difference. For entree I ordered the Los Drowned, Little Goats version of a French Dip. DELISH. and ask for the hot sauces. Made in house and there was a habenero one that went oh so well with my sandwich... mmm. My DH ordered the Korean Pancake with pork Belly. He really enjoyed the cole slaw it came with but it wasnt my favorite, though a creative blend of flavors that I can respect. Also in our group was ordered the Kimchi Rueben, excellent, theloco moto Veggie burger, super hearty for a veggie patty, and the goat almighty, a wowza impressive monster that tasted like a heart attack. But an enjoyable one nonetheless. Needless to say, we were all very satisfied with our meals and if we can avoid the weekend wait, we will be back!"
"Good with a couple comments.  Food is unique and tasted great.  Coffee tasted great.  Having said that if you are not into unique ways of having a breakfast dish, skip it.  For example,  waffles - but with peanut butter butter and bacon bits.  But they make it work because it tasted good.  Lastly, the place is loud, it was hard to hear people at the other end of our table."
"This place is one of the coolest restaurants I've ever been to. It's laid-back, yet the food stands by itself. So amazingly good. Try the fish tostadas. Get French fries. You won't be sorry."
"My wife and kids (12 and 14) happened to be in town during the week so we all went there for lunch. Awesome and even suitable for teens.  I had the korean burger with Kimci and a fried egg. You have to have acquired a taste for kimci but the burger was pretty good. My daughter had the buffalo burger (not buffalo meat, buffalo sauce) and it was awesome! Going back just for that. Smoked fries are a must."
"I came here with a decently large group last night for the diner portion's opening night. I must admit that I am biased, as I've had a foodie crush on Stephanie Izard since Top Chef Chicago, but I was thoroughly impressed. The menu is a twist on classic American food; it's the grub at your favorite 24-hour diner, except that most of the offerings contain pork belly, kimchi, or (of course) some kind of goat product. We split a smorgasbord of food. Biscuit and gravy is a winner; towering, airy, just-buttery-enough biscuit topped with a sumptuous saucy gravy. Hash browns are grated finely and mixed with nuggets of creamy goat cheese. Mac and cheese is very rich, with a crispy top as it ought to have. Both breakfast food offerings we sampled were divine; the kimchee, bacon and egg pancake is the most inventive iteration of the ""grand slam"" style breakfast I've ever seen (which is not to say that it resembles anything you would try at Denny's), and the pork belly pancake is a more refined version of the street offerings I enjoyed in Bangkok; can't say I know of many diners that crank out scallion pancakes. In my mind, however, the show stealers were the burgers and sandwiches. Sloppy goat sandwich has the same homey flavors of an all-day cooked Italian potroast; slimy, yet satisfying. Burgers are offered permutation style; diners choose between  goat, beef, turkey, or veggie patties, with a variety of topping combinations; we opted for goat korean style (kimchi, bacon, egg on a squash roll) and beef ""wing"" style (buffalo sauce, bleu cheese, celery, onion on potato roll). While I can't include these in my burger ranking calculus just yet (as we ordered them medium to assuage our large crowd), I suspect that they'll be in my upper echelon, despite my preference for spartan patties. The meat is moist and cooked to order, the buns are among the best I've tried, and the accoutrements, while whimsical, do not distract from the meat, but enhance it. Desserts range from childhood classics (cookie pie) to truly off the wall (smoked pork and toffee crunch milkshake). All of them are decadent and beyond worth the calories. Drink menu is short but sweet, with 15 excellent beers on tap, including a sumptuous red ale that Haymarket whipped up just for Little Goat. As if it needed another plus, the coffee bar makes the meanest macchiato I've ever enjoyed stateside. Pricing is, obviously, not what it is at your hometown diner (everything a la carte, sandwiches and burgers $10-$12, sides $5-$8, desserts $6-$9), but for the quality of the food, it's pretty much a steal. Service is very attentive and personal; just as is the case across the street, Little Goat does a good job hiring people you'd actually want to hang out with, including (and in our case especially) the busboys. Also, they brought Stephanie by our table, which was awesome (even if I managed to make a fool out of myself due to intense star-struckness). Ambiance is modern but thoroughly inviting; it was very difficult to convince everyone to leave. With the caveat that I'm seeing this through intensely rose colored glasses, I must say that I found Little Goat to be among the happiest places on Earth. I'll be back religiously!"
"Awesome!  this place has killer diner food, and is much easier to get a table than the G&G.  anyway, felt the need to report on the Los Drowned.  Dear lord - you have to get in on that badboy...prices are pretty reasonable and you can get great drinks too.  cant go wrong!"
"Went here for dinner.  Great casual space, extremely knowledgeable and attentive wait staff, but very disappointed with the food.I eat fairly healthy but do like to indulge sometimes, but this place was beyond indulgent.  I felt ill after eating only half my meal.  The food was extremely heavy and rich.  Everything tasted like it was cooked in butter or meat fat and had sugar added to it.  We had the nachos and they were beyond sweat, I couldn't stand it.  We also tried the sloppy goat.  I love goat meat, it's nice and lean, but this again was super sweat and really fatty because of the fat it was cooked in. I really enjoyed Girl in the Goat, but I left here feeling sick and never wanting to return."
"If I could give Little Goat 6 stars... I WOULD! Came to the restaurant last night with some co-workers from Miami to enjoy some of the best food that Chicago (and Stephanie Izard) have to offer. Everything that we ordered was nothing but amazing and everyone enjoyed the cool vibe! We were very lucky to be served by Dylan who was very attentive, provided wonderful recommendations and made our experience at the Little Goat memorable. Lastly, a special shout-out to our FAVORITE manager Ben-- You made our night. Let's just say that we will never look at blueberry pie the same!! Thank you again for such delicious food and exceptional service!"
"I loved the food, cocktails, and gluten-free menu. I was a bit annoyed that after ordering something from the gluten-free menu, the wait staff asked if I was just sensitive or celiacs. When I said sensitive, she said the kitchen likes to know, to be sure the customer ""won't die."" I found this annoying and a bit rude, as well as uneducated. You can't tell how someone is affected based on the boxes ""sensitive"" or ""celiacs"".  I personally know celiacs, diagnosed by a medical doctor, who won't die if they eat gluten, but they will get a terrible upset stomach. I also know sensitive people who won't die either  but they suffer from headaches, acne, digestive problems, joint pain, sometimes after just eating a little bit of gluten. And while not deadly, these symptoms are uncomfortable. I think instead of trying to pry into my personal health, she should have just informed me about what ""gluten free"" means on their menu, i.e., cross contamination, etc. I think the beauty of having a gluten-free menu should be that I'm not having to explain myself. Other than that, I loved the food, the menu, and everything. I will be back!"
"My dad and I got there at around 11am on a Sunday.  We waited 30ish minutes for a table, but I would happily have waited more, since we wiled away our minutes sipping coffees on the roof.  I got the spanish omelette (which the waitress recommended over the biscuits and gravy) which was awesome.  The omelette itself was as lovely as an omelette can be, and it was topped with roasted tomatoes and onions and corn chip thingies that were so good I probably would have eaten just that.  My dad got the special (some sort of tostada), which he loved.The only downsides are that the restaurant is (rather understandably) loud and I kind of hated the stupid purple dresses the waitresses had to wear.  Also the barista who was working that morning was infuriatingly slow, or maybe I was just under-caffeinated."
"i love girl & the goat, and this is definitely a much more accessible ""version"" of that. my review is purely based on my tastes as an eater. my only beef is that basically everything on the menu is very rich, creamy, cheesy, etc. i take full responsibility for the fact that i am a weirdo who doesn't enjoy these things as much as most people. i loved it when we went to girl & the goat because i figured it was a once in a blue moon indulgence. here, since you CAN go more frequently, it would just be nice to see a few more dishes on the menu that people can eat without ingesting 2,000 calories. the food ITSELF is amazing, though. the sloppy goat is great and so are the ""tacos"" with goat meat. definitely give it a shot."
Hands down the best food I had in Chicago. Came from the suggestion of a local and I am so glad I went. There was an hour wait but it was worth the wait! There is a cute coffee bar attached where you can wait. I had the fried pickle sandwich and it was nothing short of amazing and also unique. My friend had the waffle which was also amazing. No one had any complaints about the food or service. Definitely go here.
"Awesome place for a bite.  Came by here a few months ago on a nasty ice storm day.  Nothing better to soothe your soul than having a nice warm cup of coffee.  Thankfully, on account of the weather, we didn't have to wait long but even if we did, it would definitely be worth it."
"This place is excellent-everything we had was fresh, flavorful and unique.  The decor, friendly staff, the food.....start with a Little Goat or if you want a cocktail, The Fizz is fresh and refreshing!  I ordered the trout my husband ordered shrimp and grits-both amazing choices!  Make sure to take home some bread or baked goods from the bakery...we've tried 5 different types of bread and they are all unique and flavorful.  I don't think you can make any bad choices at this place to be honest!"
"There's good food and good service, and then there's great food and great service. Little Goat exemplifies the latter. Ordered the Ham N' Cheese Omelette with Hash Browns which were better than my high expectations. There's something about good ingredients prepared well that just tastes better. My server, Joan, provided perfect service in every way with a smile. Can't wait to go back."
"My boyfriend and I stopped in at Little Goat for a late night dinner. We were really happy with everything! Our server was really great (although stretched pretty thin) and at the end of the meal apologized for not spending as much time with us as she would have liked. I got the chive pancake with pork belly and hoisin sauce and it was this combination of salty fatty carby goodness that was so good I only came up for air to steal bites of my boyfriend's croque monster, a giant ham egg and cheese omelette. All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked so good that I'm excited to go back."
"I've now been to Little Goat four times.  While it can be hard to get into during prime lunch (weekday's) or brunch (weekend) hours, if you go when the hip crowd isn't up yet (7 - 8am), the place is nearly empty.  While I've had a number of things on the menu for both lunch and breakfast, one of my favorites so far is the burrito.  It has some interesting flavor combinations with the indian sauces and the salad and eggs.  The pies are delicious, as well as the shakes.  Lastly, they maintain an excellent, rotating beer selection that's well though out and locally oriented."
"It does not get any more pretentious than this place. Another attempt at making something of the ""common man's"" into an upscale experience.I Went for breakfast with friends based upon awesome reviews we heard. For a diner it is over decorated, for finer dining it was awfully loud. So loud we could not hear our server. The menu was limited to a few overthought choices. I wanted a traditional breakfast so I selected the small biscuits and gravy, 2 eggs and the cheesy grits. Biscuit was enjoyable with good texture but lacked ample gravy. A tiny ladle was stripped across the top. The eggs were small, obviously not grade A large. The grits were disgusting; coarse and bland! The chef fails at knowing grits are that in name only, not in texture! I had to remind myself I'm in the Midwest and some people are not familiar with their true form. They were also cold and only earned the cheese in their name from the light sprinkle on top. I could have ordered similar food at any diner in town and had better quality and flavor for a fraction of the price. My partner ordered pancakes that as he put it, were ""meh"" - also not worth the price for the average quality. Pancakes are a staple of any attempt at being a diner and is something you need to get right! Our friend had the prathas breakfast burrito. It was served open faced??? with the eggs underneath and piles of toppings on top. It looked more like a salad and was difficult to eat. A scone we shared was the best part of our meal but the heavy use of fennel seed made it uncomfortable to eat. We are honestly dumbfounded by the glowing reviews as this is clearly a place heavy on style and LOW on substance. Yes, the place was beautifully decorated inside and the server was attentive but overall I go to a dining spot for the food and judge it based upon overall quality versus the price. Simply charging more and adding a twist to every dish does not make any place worth more. We tipped very well knowing we will not be back. Our server was great and we don't hold her accountable for the decisions of the owner and chefs."
"I went for breakfast and got the kimchee, bacon, eggs, pancakes asian style breakfast tasty thing. It was pretty damn good. There was so much I took it about half of it home, it was just as good the next day. I like my kimchee with a little more pickle and spice than this had but it was still a great take on korean style kimchee and korean style pancakes. I also had a side of hash browns. It had bits of goat cheese that were nice, a little heavy handed with the oil but still decent overall. I'd definitely go back for to sample something of the lunch or dinner menu, or even breakfast again."
Love this place! We grabbed a quick drink on the rooftop deck last Sunday - very fun and delicious!
We went for lunch on a weekday and it was hoppin!  We got there at 11:30a so we were able to be seated right away.Service was great.  Food was great.  Loved the tempura mashed potatoes and the Spanish omelet.  My lunch companions both had burgers and they were very satisfied.
"Really good dinner at Little Goat. I love that you can put your name in, and then they'll text you when your table is ready. SO nice.Bests:Bull's eye French toast (chicken/waffles essentially)Blueberry pancakes with this amazing granola-y, sugary crumble and cream cheese butterGoat cheese hashbrownsBreakfast burritoOther notables:Sloppy goat sandwichKimchee & bacon & eggs & tasty breakfast pancake thing"
"I've never had anything to eat from here, but the coffee is GREAT!  I am kind of fussy about my cappuccino, and they make a great one.  The baristas and cashiers are also very welcoming and are quick to learn who you are and what you drink if you are a regular.  The best part of my morning!  Thanks guys!"
"We had a 45 minute wait when we got there at 11am on a Sunday morning.  We had the crab dip, the Mac and cheese, the goat burger open face with fries and chile, and the pork tenderloin sandwich. WOW.  Everything was delicious and I don't think we finished any dish, as the portions are large. The service staff were all very nice and helpful.  We would return one day, although its hard to justify the wait when there is Au Cheval at the other end of the block."
"We ate there for the first time last night. No wait, which was good, and the end seets on a largely empty communal table, which was fine. Restaurant design and layout, nice. Waiter, liked him. But the food, not there at all. We had the fried pickles and onion rings, and they were just ... bad. We left at least half of them on the plate. Way too much breading. Not enough pickle somewhere in the breaded pickles. A little undercooked, too, just enough to make them disappointingly gloppy except at the edges. My $19 burger just didn't cut it, either; it wasn't at all medium rare (as ordered), and it just wasn't tasty. The burgers at Owen & Engine on Western and at Revolucion on Broadway, for example, are vastly better (and also way cheaper). And my chocolate malt, no malt flavor, negligible chocolate taste, and skimpy at the price. I doubt I'll go back. We were aiming for Au Cheval but couldn't get in and wound up at Little Goat, and, next time, I'd opt for Au Cheval or one of the may other options."
"I have been to Little Goat 3 times now and tried something different each time.  It's wonderful.  Most recently I ordered The Tofu Griddle because the ingredients sounded great.  (I'm not even vegetarian, this is only the second time in my life I ate Tofu).  It was UNBELIEVABLE.  My boyfriend gets the Bull's Eye French Toast every time.  You literally cannot go wrong here."
"This review is mainly regarding the host staff with a small food review. I want to preface this by saying that from 1998 - 2004 I worked in restaurants as a busser, hostess and waitress from 16 until I finished college, so I am pretty familiar with how things go in restaurants and am extremely sympathetic to my brothers and sisters in the biz because I know how hard you work for very little in the way of thanks or compensation.That said, if I could give the hostess negative stars I would. After waiting 45 minutes for a table(it was Sunday at 10am I get that we would have to wait) we were called up to the host desk to get our table. Being starved and in need of more coffee we were excited to be seated. Then we waited, and waited, and waited. I finally asked what the hold up was and was told they were clearing tables. I said ok and proceeded to wait more. I noticed a fully bused table and asked the hostess if that was our table, she said no, the one next to it that still needed to be bussed was. (Quick sidenote as a hostess I was often expected to bus tables and grab waters and coffee for customers if we were slammed so I wondered why none of the hostesses were helping out the staff) I explained that my friend was catching a flight to Atlanta and could we just have that one. she shouted at me ""No you can just wait another 30 seconds until your table is ready!"" Whoa. Um ok. I would have happily continued waiting at the little coffee bar in the next room where I was but you paged me up here 5 minutes ago to ""seat"" me. I was stunned. A- because I was trying to be polite and B- because really who speaks to a customer that way in front of a crowd of other customers. My friends and I were totally stunned. Then she stormed off to the kitchen and came back with a busser/server and we were seated. Another busser who brought our plates and specifically said to me ""This one is your plate"" um ok. My friend made a comment that the hostess must have ordered a plate with something ""special"" on it for me. I laughed but was unsettled and didn't eat off that plate. I felt really awkward for the rest of the meal.I will say our waitress was a delight and I told her so. The food was fine, but I have had better biscuits and gravy. I was excited that they had Stumptown coffee as it gave me warm fuzzies remembering a recent trip to Portland.Unfortunately, those few good things did not make up for the treatment we experienced there and my  friends and I have decided not to return. There are way too many restaurants in Chicago to check out to have to deal with that treatment and the specter of a spit chaser in my coffee courtesy of an angry hostess."
"I'm pretty sure I could eat anything off of this menu and think I died and went to heaven. Then, to do so, and be in the presence of such great music (often old school hip hop), makes me want to eat every meal here. The kicker? The place has a great design. I always feel like I'm somewhere fancy, but VERY comfy, if that makes sense. I feel like that's a rarity. I love you, Little Goat, for your wonderful atmosphere, tunes, and of course, your delicious dishes."
"Unbelievable. We had the biscuits 'n gravy, the blueberry pancakes, and the peanut butter waffle. First time I have ever taken home left over pancakes and waffles. Haha, Lived up to the hype for sure."
Best breakfast food I've had in Chicago.  I come here almost once a week now.  Portions are generous and everything I've ordered has been great.  I stick to their blueberry pancakes or the French toast with fried chicken on top.  I feel a little fat when I leave but oh boy am I happy.The place doesn't cost any more than any other place you'd consider for brunch/breakfast.  But the food is way better and there is more of it.  Go here!
"I've been here for brunch twice. Once with friends and once with my wife. The service here really sets the tone. The diner isn't huge but it's comfortable because of the level of organization and service that the staff deliver. The first time I went, my wife and I found a packed diner but were seated within 10 mins at the diner counter. The cool thing about eating at the diner counter is that you get a direct view of the kitchen and dishes coming out. I also saw Stephanie walk past, which was a huge plus!Now to the food. What can I say? I truly believe they can do no wrong. I had the Sloppy Goat and all I can say is dayyyummmm. Perfect flavor, bun, and crunch. My wife and I were sharing food the entire time and I highly recommend LG any day you need some good grub with a smile!"
"Great sandwiches, super cool atmosphere. Gets crowded in a hurry."
"Very fun atmosphere, crazily large menu and quite tasty food.  Not sure it is quite all it is cracked up to be, but you have to love the bakery, one of the best in Chicago.  No reservations and a killer line, so watch out."
"Had the BEST time at the Little Goat for Sunday brunch!Don't go if you're in a hurry (the wait is an hour to an hour and a half), but it is worth it!Everything we tried from the menu (which we all split because we couldn't decide on just one thing), was amazing, and the service was great! We had the best time with our service (JP? I wish I remembered his name, because he rocked). After brunch we checked out the great rooftop bar, where the adorable spinning goat overlooked us sipping on our cocktails! Super cute place, with great food, service, and prices. Go here immediately!"
Shrimp sandwich is amazing!!!!!!
"Great menu. Creative egg dishes anytime, hurrah. This is our new go to place when we can't decide. It's a diner with pizzazz."
"Went there yesterday for an early dinner on a Sunday. Arrived at 4:15pm. The hostess said it would be an hour wait and we ended up waiting just under an hour. There's a bar in the back and the 3 of us waited back there for our table. There was no room at the bar to sit though. I was surprised that at such an odd hour that this place was packed. Little Goat is apparently the trendy new restaurant.-Beautiful restaurant. It's all new inside so it's clean and nicely decorated.  High ceilings with a large skylight in the center.  Bathrooms are nice but they have hand dryers not paper towels. Clientele ran the whole gamut from kids to seniors.-Service was good. Waitress was friendly, accurate, and prompt.-Food was good. I had the ""sloppy goat"" sandwich and a side order of smoked fries. I was expecting a new experience in meat eating but it didn't seem that different than pork or chicken. Oh well, it was still good, perhaps not $12 sandwich good since it doesn't come with a side. FYI, it's all a la carte. The smoked fries were okay. Once again, nothing new or remarkable. My dinner guests had the french dip and the american burger. They liked their meals. I tried their mash potatoes. They were marginally better than the fries. -We drove and found street parking a block and a half north on Green. It was free.Since I live in Lakeview, it's likely I'll only go again if I'm already in the area for another reason."
"Dining here was one of my first foray's into the dinning mecca of Randolph Street, so I was excited when my family and I walked by and saw it wasn't crazy busy and little to no wait (about 8:30pm on a Thursday...actually some what surprising).  Definitely a cool looking restaurant with some great design, but really quite noisy.  It was hard to hold a conversation with the others at my table.  The menu had some interesting items, but maybe it was just the mood I was in, but nothing really stood out to me and wow'ed me.  The food wasn't bad when it arrived (I got the bullseye french toast) but others in my party were generally disappointed.  The overall service was pretty mediocre.  We ordered the Hot Crab Dip, which was ok but didn't have nearly enough crackers.  It was hard to get someones attention to get someones attention, so much so that someone in my dad had to get up and find someone.  Water glasses and drink glasses were left unfilled.  I want to give The Little Goat another chance, so I'll try to return someday, hopefully for a better experience!"
Love this place. Great food and service. I would definitely go back again and again.
"While I'd be the first to say the Girl and the Goat fully lives up to the hype, I'm not as big a fan as this place. With that said, this is a very well run place that puts out interesting takes on classic diner food. The ambiance is excellent, the attached bakery is delightful, the pricing is reasonable, the service effortless, and the food decent. With that said and the place is crazy packed, as I ate their odd take on eggs benedict I wondered about all the other diners in Chicago which probably were empty and much more deserving of our patronage. I dunno - classic diner food is classic since well, its classic. I'm not sure I need kimchi on my eggs benedict."
"Love this place!  I've been here close to a dozen times and haven't been disappointed yet.  I love the Goat burger, smoked fries, and goat chili.  They also do this toffee and pork accented milkshake that's heavenly.  All the alcoholic beverages are great too-Smoke on the Horizon is my favorite."
"Just had an awesome breakfast here (at noon). I sat at the counter so I got to peep all the dishes as they came to the pass. Everything, but especially the fish tostadas which everyone seemed to order, looked amazing. On the first of what will be many visits I had the Bull's Eye French Toast. The bull's eye being a sunny side up egg cooked in the center of each sweet onion brioche slab of French toast. It's served up with fried chicken, bbq maple syrup, and gooseberries which serve wonderfully to cut the richness of the dish. For dessert I had the smoked pork and toffee shake. Unbelievably savory and delicious Can't wait to return for lunch to try some of those amazing looking sammiches, and eventually a dinner."
"Meh. First of all LG obviously doesn't know what a blue plate special is because contrary to its definition, the meal was the most expensive item on our bill. The décor and vibe are great, but they could use some sound proofing.  It's super hard to have a decent conversation without having to yell a little. Service was also good, quick and friendly.Next the food - most everything was underwhelming. The mac n' cheese was creamy, but some cheese flavor would be great...very bland. The sloppy goat and chicken tostada (BPS) were decent. The hot crab dip is nothing special. We drizzled the house chipotle hot sauce on everything! We came for dinner so maybe you're better coming for breakfast/brunch/lunch or maybe we ordered the wrong stuff. For the price, I think it's worth checking out, but maybe not a second time.Final thoughts:  LG misses the mark."
Terrible dinner. Food bad. Cold and flavorless. Fish soup had about one tablespoon of fishy stuff and a giant glob of mashed potatoes. Fried chicken greasy and cold. No taste cole slaw. Four people one drink each tab was $230. Don't go.
"Food is delicious, although a bit pricey for diner food.  The portions are gigantic, and the drink selection is good."
"Aren't little sisters suppose to be adorable and scrumptious? In this case the big sister runs circles around her lil sis, the Little Goat, and leaves her in the dust. I have tried Little Goat two different times, once for breakfast and again for dinner. And the food lacks the flavor nuances I would expect from Izzard's creations. The dishes all seem overdone and not in a good way - like mixing paint colors - a little fuschia, then some chartreuse, then some aqua, and then, oops...what is this unappealing brown color? Yes, you can play with flavors and go too far and end up with an unappealing and heavy-handed dish. Such is the case with the meals I've eaten here. No malice toward Ms Izzard because she has proven herself with Girl & the Goat!"
Just amazing. Love everything about this place. Bought multiple loaves of different breads to take home. Bacon and Gouda bread was outstanding.
"TOTALLY disappointed! I can't believe that The Girl and The Goat is sooooo good and Little Goat is soooooooooooo bad! Asian pancakes HORRIBLE! The Brandade disgusting! The star I'm giving here is for dessert, the blueberry pie is good and what makes it even better is the goat cheese ice cream! But the ice cream is from Black Dog Gelato (amazing!!!) so Stephanie's pie only deserves one star!"
A great comfort food menu and breakfast served all day. Friendly staff and a cool diner atmosphere.
"I flew solo, which afforded me the privilege of skipping the crowds of people waiting at the door and go straight to their counter.I think they thought I was ""Somebody"" because of all the attention I received, but I soon realized that the service was Just That Good, and everybody seemed as well handled as I.It was loud, and my waitress needed to repeat herself so I could be sure I heard her right - She started reciting the special of the day which sounded delightful, but I invited her to offer me something that would make me want to come back.   We settled on the Pork Belly Pancakes, and I had her surprise me with a libation paring of her choosing,  turned out to be something citrus-ey, with a body you'd expect from a Stout.   The pancake was layered with a thick juicy steak of pork belly hidden by a slaw.   Can I say OMFG on yelp ?  I wish I paid attention to which beer I had, cause I would be that much closer to ordering it again next time I go."
Yum!! It's so delicious! I love the diner feel and watching the urban looking cooks in the back. Just a really great place with great food! Go there with an appetite! And the apple tomato soup is bomb!!
"You know my favorite thing about this place?  It's something you don't see of a ton anymore, when you come in, or when I came in, I noticed all the nice things about the space, the choice decor, the high low ambiance, but, the thing that stood out the most was the sense of pride coming from the staff working there.   You can just tell that the people who work at this place just love it, must be treated well, and take a real sense of pride and ownership of this space in a completely genuine way.   I think that says volumes about the owner on so many levels.  It was really impressive.  I will need to go back when I am hungrier, they give you a LOT of food."
"If your looking for a bit of adventure on a menu coupled with a great staff and drink options, Little Goat is your place.    This was my second time here and I am already thinking of my next trip and what to try.  The atmosphere is a great alternative for those that need comfort food with an twist and can't wait four months to get into the Girl and the Goat.   The space is clean with wonderful booths and communal tables so if you fear closeness or folks listening to your conversation, you will need to wait for a booth which is hard to come by.  I had a great brisket sandwich while my dining partner in crime had the shrimp and grits.    Amazing portion size and wonderful flavors.  The best piece of the night was the crazy sundae called Cheez-it which included strawberry, peanut butter ice cream and chocolate covered Cheez-it.   Though my friend Anne and I were intrigued and worried, it was absolutely the best item that night we had.   Once again, if you are willing to think outside the box and dive into strange combinations, you will find Little Goat Diner might be your new home."
"Horrible service, ignored and drinks took 25min to receive with no apology.  Food only mediocre."
Oh my gawd. This place is beyond amazing! I had the fish tostadas and we ordered Mac n Cheese as an appetizer. The portions are generous and very tasteful! You won't leave hungry. They have a decent selection of drinks and the service was great! We sat at this long community table with other people which always makes things fun and interesting. I will be back for sure! Make sure you make a reservation or get there super early!
"Cute diner! Love the retro vibe and upbeat atmosphere. Had eggs benedict with pork belly and kimchi and it was full of flavor and perfect! Definitely would go back for breakfast, lunch or dinner! Great menu selection."
nothing short of amazing. everything i have ever had from here was fantastic.
"Hostess said 30-45mim. They had us sat in 15min.  That's a big win! The breakfast menu is unique and it's the kind of food I expect of a Girl and the Goat sister restaurant. The Dinner menu lacked that same creativity. I realize this is supposed to be a less formal dining experience and I realize it's a different restaurant, but if you're going to keep continuity in the name you have to deliver the same creativity in the menu.  I could eat breakfast there everyday, but I'll probably try something else later in the day. Try the bullseye french toast. It's my favorite menu item."
"Seriously as good as it gets. It is important for people to understand what they are getting when they come to this diner so please review the menu before you arrive and also understand that you will have to wait a while to sit down. My experience was excellent. Service with a smile and fast. I had the Los Drowned (braised beef) sandwich, it was arguably the best thing I have ever eaten. Went on a Tuesday evening, no wait, sat right down. Many people complain about the wait at peak times but that comes with the territory with all the top restaurants in Chicago. We shared the crab dip as well, also excellent. My GF had the fried pickle sandwich which was also excellent and unique. Finished the evening with a warm cookie pie...do I need to tell you how good it was? It's a warm cookie pie, enough said. This place is always worth trying and I suggest off-peak hours for your first experience to lighten the wait time."
This place definitely belongs in the West Loop. The decor is fabulous!  The food is very fancy with lots of flavors.  I have to admit my stomach was angry at me later.   I would not be able to eat here often.
"After an incredible meal at Girl & the Goat we had to try Little Goat for breakfast on our way out of town. It was sensational! Imagine all of the delicious items you'd expect from a diner but reinvented, modernized and loaded with more awesome flavor than you can imagine. The Asian Style Breakfast Tasty Thingy was all that it's name suggests! This place rocks, we can't wait to get back again soon!"
Just go.Good lord....
"review is for the restaurant, not the bakery.came here on opening day for a late lunch. there was a crowd and the wait time was honest (~45 mins) but we were undeterred and spent the time exploring the bakery, upstairs, and standing there. they have the option 2 txt u when ur tbl is rdy, so that's cool.service was slightly slow and spotty, but it was opening day. we got a reuben that was good but a bit watery/drippy, mashed potatoes w/ beef gravy which were awesome, and some mac and cheese which was a tad bland. for dessert we got fried fluffernutter which is actually a PB&J deconstruction thing. pretty good if you're ok with slightly heavy desserts. they comped us dessert due to the spotty service (which was actually ok, compared to some other experiences) so that was nice. everything is a la carte, so the sandwich didn't come with fries or anything. all told it'd probably be $20 for a sammich and fries. kinda on the high end.they have some large table which are used for communal seating so you might make a new friend. the space itself is quite a looker, with lots of natural light to help you take pictures of your food. this way you can remember what you ate and show other people too.the bathrooms to the restaurant are behind a secret door. there are individual rooms, 2 for mens and 3 for womens. to my delight the hand drying method is like a dyson airblade, except it's tons of little jets that feel great on your hands. bravo, my dry hands clapped. bravo.another opening day snafu maybe, we saw some empty spots while we were waiting and eating, but they remained unfilled despite a wait upfront. maybe they're trying to pace the kitchen?so anyway the LG was good and I'd like to try more of the menu, but I suspect it will be rather busy. When we left around 3pm, it was thinning out a bit, so hopefully this will be an ""off hour seating ok"" kinda place."
"The food is fantastic! Completely original with amazing flavors! I had the burrito with naan bread and would highly recommend it!The only downfall is that is can take over an hour to hour and a half to get a table, and even then you can be sitting at a communal table or the counter. But you can always go into the Little Goat Bread for a coffee and pastry while you are waitingI will definitely be going back!\"
"We went to Girl and the Goat on Sunday night and loved it, so we wanted to try this place. We got there on Tuesday around 10:30 am. It wasn't that crowded, and we got seated promptly. We asked to be seated at the bar seats in front of the kitchen, and they said, ""Of course!""We were a bit overwhelmed with menu (there are SO many choices), but our server (I think her name was Joan) was so friendly and helpful. She recommended the Shrimp and Grumpy Goat Grits. It was definitely not what I was expecting. I was expecting some grits with a tiny handful of tiny shrimp. Uh.. boy, what the heck was I thinking? It was this awesome intricate dish with ""real"" shrimp, greens, and delicious grits. I thought it was a little salty, but it was still good. My boyfriend got the Tonkatsu sammich, which was good too. He didn't really like the sauce, but he enjoyed it.We also got the smoked fries, which were SO good. He is trying to find all the places with good fries, and this place is probably one of the best. We also dropped by the bakery next door and got a loaf of French bread. Yum!All in all, I think I prefer the Girl and the Goat, but this place is good too. I really want to come back and try one of the breakfast items, like the waffles or pancakes. Looking forward to another visit!"
Tasty sandwiches and lovely service. The food here is so creative. Ingredients that you would never think of putting together (ex: Los Drowned) come together to create delightful new flavors! Love it!
"Oh Little Goat, where to start.First, after hearing all about the new BOKA concept, I had relatively high expectations -- is that so wrong? The Boy's parents were in town for the weekend, and this seemed like the perfect, casual but grounded place to take them. First, we arrived around 8 pm on a Friday. Working in the industry, I know this isn't the ideal time to go to a restaurant, especially without reservations. The hostess took our name and told us it would be about an hour, and that she would text us - yes, text us - when our table was ready. Sorry, Lil Goaty, but texting isn't hostessing and never will be. We finally got to our table. Another 20 minutes passes and our server finally comes up to us, and said, ""whaddayawannadrink."" Literally, that's it. I shouldn't be so critical of waitstaff because I know it was super busy that night, and I know she probably had a lot on her plate -- but we didn't even have anything on ours. The food was good, I think, a little pricey for what we got, but hey. Unfortunately, I can't look past the quality of service. We could be getting Big Macs or filet mignon, and it's all going to be awful if the service is awful. Step up your game, Little Goat, everybody already loves you, so you have an awful lot to live up to."
Superb Bloody Mary Food is amazing Stuff is friendly Worth the wait
Great diner food. Good atmosphere.
"LG, you are too much. By too much, I mean too much hype, too much salt, too much cooking on my burger, and too much selling of your product, which I didn't feel was that good to begin with. Sure. You're a diner. I get it. Best part about you is the bar where we waited out the underquoted wait. You've got to know as a professional courtesy to err in overquoting. The drinks were nice, bartenders friendly and smilin', always good. When we got called for our table, our tableside meal assistant was overly selling himself, the concept, and the Chef who lives across the street, and anything but the food. He called me boss, he called my lady ""chicky"", and other outdated terms that just seemed really patronizing. For as much as he sold the concept, he either didn't pay attention, or the kitchen didn't. Knowing what I want as a customer and clarifying that I want my burger done medium (pretty standard), and having it come out well? All my fries were caked in salt. The rest of the food was just okay. Question: What makes this fried noodle and lettuce wrapped shrimp cocktail stand out from Guy Fieri's Texas PrawnTornados?  If the menu was designed by a Top Chef, and she's really worth her salt, she needs to take a look at how it's being executed."
Los Drowned was amazing
Ultimately disappointed with the brandade and pork belly (they ran out of the french toast).  Flavors truly do not work.  My partner was not overly fond of the pork belly pancake. A bit on the salty side. Asian and American breakfast fusion? Pass.
"We have a large family and are often looking for a brunch place that can accommodate us in Chicago.  This past Sunday, it took about a hour to get a table for twelve at 9:50AM, but turned out to be worth the wait.  The food was well prepared and truly enjoyed by everyone.  Loved the Fat Elvis Waffles - great change from the norm.  Hash browns, Spiced Apple pancakes, and Chocolate Chip pancakes were shared and ravished by all.  Highly recommend the Little Goat Coffee.  Our server, Joan, was attentive by not obtrusive, making good suggestions and very helpful to our (and the kids) needs.  The other staff worked well in concert.Would highly recommend and plan to go back again soon!"
"This place is awesome. I have been here 3 times in the last month. The first two visits were solely for the purpose of eating breakfast and the last visit was for dinner. Visit 1 was great. The server was cool, attentive, and answered all our questions about the menu without any apprehension or uncertainty (the menu has several unique combinations of ingredients and some items we were unfamiliar with). I ordered the cinnamon bun, which I highly recommend!!! I also ordered the Little Goat coffee which was sooooo good (you must be okay with goat's milk, because the flavor is pretty strong). I ordered the Spanish omelette. To say the least it was amaze balls. I am a big breakfast guy, and I have a sweet tooth. My go to breakfast is always french toast. But I decided since this place is suppose to be awesome and comes with the reputation associated with girl and the goat across the street I am going to challenge them with my least favorite breakfast item. They knocked it out the park. It literally looked like beams of light from heaven were shining down on my omelette giving this shiny gloss of perfection (there is a skylight, so technically there were beams of sunlight coming through the ceiling and lighting up the room...and my omelette). Everything about my omelette was awesome. My friend ordered the Reuben and I had a bit and it was sooo tasty. The bread looked soo good and the ingredients looked fresh and abundant. I recommended this place to my friends who were in town for the weekend to celebrate a birthday and they loved it. I went back with my brother and his girlfriend and this time around I ordered the french toast. Their was an egg IN the french toast. I tried to order the cinnamon bun but they were out. I was surprised because it was 9AM on a Monday (they open at 730 i think), but because they are so damn good I figured they must have been in high demand earlier in the day. My brother and his girlfriend ordered something on the menu that looked great and they said it was great but I was to preoccupied with my own breakfast to take any notice. The bacon maple syrup was something out of my dreams. Our server on this visit was this really beautiful brunette who I gave an ""I Love Pencils"" pencil too in addition to the tip we gave her on the bill. She was very nice, professional, and well versed with the menu. She answered all our questions and checked up on us several times to see how we were doing. My most recent visit was this evening with an old college buddy and my roommate. We stopped in for dinner and I ordered the Fat Club sandwich. My buddy ordered the Sloppy Goat, and the roommate ordered the Los Drowned (braised beef and buttercase cheese among other deelish ingredients). He says it's basically their take on a french dipped sandwich.The sloppy goat was good according to my friend. He really like the cabernet he ordered. I liked my fat club sandwich but didn't love it like I loved my omelette and french toast. I think I should have gone with the Reuben. There was nothing wrong with my sandwich. Ingredients were beast mode and super abundant and fresh. Nothing about it wowed me except the size o the sandwich. I remembered the reuben had a really good flavor about it that stood out for me. The server was really nice. She got me a spoon for the coffee i ordered so promptly that she ninja'd it next to me and I hadn't noticed. When she came back to take our order I asked for the spoon for a second time and she pointed out that she had already placed it on the table for me. I had requested with such a snobby tone and she handled it like a pro and smiled. Kudos to her. I know I can be a brat sometimes. Overall service was stellar every time. Food was 9.5 out of 10 every time. Keep doing what you're doing Little Goat. Just please make sure to have Cinnamon Buns 24/7 because you guys are sooo good at making them. Thank you for being in Chicago!!!!"
"Very nice space. There are terrific plates available. With the communal seating,it's hard not to socialize with others. The opening night was as expected,crowded. There were some server errors. My wife received the wrong salad order. Though resolved immediately . The couple next to us had their order delivered to the party next to them . Though they ordered the same plate but after the couple sitting next to us. They both actually chuckled and decided to share the plate since they were expecting another. After the bugs are worked out this will be a fine add to the West Loop Mecca of Chicago dining."
"Um, yes. Do it. Go here. Make it happen. Best breakfast I've ever had?! Quite possibly. I ate the parathas burrito, and it was just the most unique and delicious thing I've ever had with some of my favorite ingredients... SO GOOD. My husband ate the kimchee tasty thing, and it was also amazing. My mom ate the special... A house-made goat-meat sausage wrapped in a pancake with their house-made BBQ syrup. Wow. Dad ate the corned beef hash. Delicious all the way around. When I go out to breakfast, I like to have something I can't make at home. This is the PLACE to fulfill my breakfast dreams."
"I am sure this place doesn't really need another rave review, but I'm gonna give it one anyway.I am a bit suprised to see people knocking the food for being ""a la carte"".  Yeah, I understand it's a $12 sandwich with no sides, but I can tell you that my Tonkatsu sandwich was HUGE and definately worth $12 (it was AWESOME!).  In fact, I ordered a side of garlic mashed potatoes (which were delicious), but I didn't even need them.  I ended up taking half the sandwich and half the potatoes home.  Granted, I also had a cup of the soup of the day (amazing) and some of the pickled onion rings (the curried mayo served with these is the BOMB.  I could eat it every day).  I will agree with some reviewers and say that the bread on my sandwich got a bit soggy due to the pork being so hot.  But I surely did not care.  In fact, writing this review is making me want to get in my car and drive back to Little Goat.  It's that good, folks.My boyfriend got the rueben and the goat chili.  I tried some of the chili, and it was awesome.  Many of the breakfast items sounded amazing as well.  (Fat Elvis waffles?  They will be mine...)In conclusion: yes, its a bit pricy for lunch/breakfast, but there are some things that are worth the money when it comes to food.  And in my opinion, this meal was worth every penny.  Stephanie- well done, girl.  I'll for sure be back!"
"Consider this a very enthusiastic preview but so far...so brilliant. I've snacked in and taken out fresh baked goods twice. The stars have not yet aligned when me and the missus are both free for a full dine-in experience (but the kimchi reuben and Elvis waffles are on the list) and I'll update when I do but, even with my limited exposure, I can hand Little Goat a well deserved 5 stars. lst visit, bagels with a schmear and an espresso at the bar with a pal. I am a devotee of crusty, crispy Montreal-style bagels...these are not like that. These are not actually directly like any other bagel I've ever had. They're not American-pouffy, New York chewy or Montreal-crackling...they are compact, divinely flavorful and 'just-right' dense...And, my Everything bagel had the everything on the Inside - great idea and I didn't have to take a lint roller to my scarf afterwards. I picked the smoked salmon CC and it was lush. The espresso (Stumptown coffee) was...a great espresso, good crema, not bitter at all...and still hard to come by in most neighborhoods (but not this one). On that trip I took a loaf of Fat Bread home (with a smoked duck fat base) for an orgiastic two-day tour of applications that included absurdly good french toast, the greatest grilled cheese sandwich ever and just rippin and dippin with good olive oil. Trip 2 - just takeout...Bagels were sold out so we got Fig and Black Pepper scones, a loaf of cheddar broccoli bread and a 1/2 pint of that smoked salmon CC. The bread and CC await deployment for breakfast tomorrow but...A Word on Scones. Perfect. So rich, so buttery, the amount of fig just right (I sound like Goldilocks) and the pepper providing a perfect counterpoint note. Damn. It was almost a Proustian madeleine moment to bite into one. I used to eat the also-perfect scones at another biz in my review roster a couple times a week...these fig scones really took me back. And A Word on Prices - brace yourself price-refuseniks...Little Goat's fresh baked goods are CHEAP, the opposite of pricey...this quality of merch at these prices is simply amazing. The scones were 2 dollars apiece. I got three. My beloved Ginger scone, from the 'other place' costs 5.99 (and that's not a knock) but...damn again, appreciate that. I'm a big Stephanie Izard booster. The Girl and The Goat felt like an institution a week after it opened. She's changing the game. I'll be in for that Kimchi Reuben soon."
"Although the atmosphere is loud and busy with a somewhat transient crowd during the lunch hour. The food preparation, plating and service were excellent."
"Walk in, give them your cell number, walk to a bar and get a text when your table is ready.  Could it be any easier?!?!  Little Goat knew that they were going to be popular, and they were prepared.  This system is pretty much amazing, and you can monitor how many parties are ahead of you through a link that they send to your cell.  Now, let's talk food.  I've been here a couple of times now, and will be a fan of the hot crab dip forever.  It's creamy and cheesy and salty and delicious.  The first time I went, I had the veggie burger (patty melt style) which wasn't good.  I'm sorry to say it, but it was almost flat out disgusting.  Fortunately, the person I was there with ordered the fish tostadas, which were great.  The fries are skinny and yummy (although I'm sure they don't make you skinny).  Best part of the meal?  The choco taco dessert.  Ridiculously amazing.When I went back, I decided to change it up and order breakfast.  The french toast is out of this world.  Everyone at the table was eating off of my plate.  The fried pickle sammie that my friend had was alright, but nothing to get excited about.  My other friend's pork belly pancake was pretty good according to him.  And what did we get for dessert?  Obviously the choco taco again!"
"Very different atmosphere than Girl and the Goat! I love it! We checked in at around 7:30p.m on a Friday night and was told it would be an hour wait and we ventured over to the bread side to grab a drink. My friend and I got the haymarket which was really good. Coming from someone who doesn't normally like beer so not sure if the beer fans will like it but I loved it.We were seated in under an hour actually. Things we got...1. Crab Dip- veryyy good very cheesy although I think it might have went a bit better with bread instead2. Broccoli and  baked cheddar - good concept, but I don't think the whole dish came together too well. It just wasn't as good as expected.3. Horseshoe- amazing! We had thoughtit was chili fries when the server brought it over at first and were really confused only to find out it was a toast with a patty topped with fries, goat chili, and sour cream and onion. Over all really good experience. We had a really nice waiter by the bar area explain to us the different brews and even got us little samples to try before we ordered. Definitely really good service there. Can't wait to go back to try their breakfast menu!Took a star off for the saltiness of the dishes though, they were all really good but it was just really salty, I had almost 2 glasses of water by the end of dinner."
"Worth the wait to get in!  Stephanie and her crew do a great job and that's why people line up to get in to her places. You will leave having eaten very well and at a reasonable price!  Two of us left full with a bill about $30.  My fave = paranthas, an Indian flatbread folded over with red beans and a fried egg inside.  The bread is toasted, golden and light and you'll have a hard time finding a place that does it better."
"I was very disappointed at the customer service when I realized my rosary bracelet from Rome was missing.  The woman answering the phone had no sense of urgency or sympathy in her voice.  Of course she called back and said they didn't see it. I asked if they checked all of the women's bathrooms and she replied with ""yeah"" to which I didn't believe her.  I am sick over this and would have appreciated a call back from a manager, instead of this woman who clearly hates her job."
Great brunch spot! Love the décor and the food. Super cozy! They are open on Sundays so don't mind the information error on Yelp!
"Went on a Tuesday morning (around 9am) and the place was nearly empty and got seated immediately.  Server was great (and cute!) and the bus boys were on their game.  The server gave some suggestions and we ended up ordering the pork belly benedict, biscuit and gravy, and Bullseye French Toast.  I don't have a single complaint about any of the dishes!  All were unique and delicious.  I don't understand when Chicagoans wait an hour for places like Yolk for a breakfast I can make at home.  This place is worth the wait cause I cannot cook like this in my kitchen!  Also I would give 6 stars if i could because Stephanie was in the kitchen!!!  She actually works in her kitchens!!!"
"We arrived for lunch around 11:45 and we just beat the big rush. Because we were willing to sit at the community table we got a seat right away. The interior of this place is absolutely gorgeous. It's an eclectic mix of muted, retro colors with modern furnishings, ornated patterns, mid century elements and natural materials. It's SO bright and airy, just perfect for even a dreary day in the city. The menu is huge, so I definitely need to go back several times. Plus they serve breakfast all day so that was really tempting. We started with fried pickles which I've had at many places, but these were definitely top notch. The batter was light and the pickles had great flavor. I also ordered a Tiramisu milkshake. I really didn't taste any of the familiar tiramisu flavors, but that aside it was an excellent shake with super rich homemade whipped cream. For my lunch entree I ended up with Los Drowned, a fantastic spin on a french dip with deliciously braised beef and a fresh and flavorful medley of toppings. The hoagie roll was perfect, and it made me really curious to check out Little Goat Bread. This woman knows her way around braising meats, as I experienced at Girl & The Goat, so it was a wise choice. We ended with the apple pie a la mode, which had cheddar cheese shredded and melted onto the top crust. The ice cream was so rich and creamy, and the apple pie itself was really homey. I would say that describes the food here in general - homey with a twist.The service was wonderful - the hostess and wait staff are all very friendly and knowledgeable. I liked the text message letting you know your wait time and when your table is ready."
"The food was delicious, creative, & huge portions! But over priced for ""diner"" food. Tried the bullseye french toast & Los drowned sandwich- both very good- the kind of good that puts a smile on your face. Also tried the hash browns with goat cheese- just okay, nothing to write home about.We sat by at the bar, which enabled us to view every dish come out from the kitchen.  I can't wait to go back to try more."
"OK, here it goes. I was not very impressed. To be honest I am so disappointed. As a fan of Stephanie from Top Chef I am very let down. The menu seemed to be full of losing dishes from the show. I struggled to find anything that sounded appetizing from the menu. And what I finally chose, the almighty goat burger was too big to eat and lacked any real zing. I will not be ordering this again. My date had the fish tostadas and they looked ok but less than inspired. The décor is a little forced but had some nice features including some really big booths, if you were lucky enough to get one. I guess we were not hipster enough to merit anything in the mostly empty place other than a small table with uncomfortable chairs.  There is shag carpeting. Yes, In a diner. Needless to say it was filthy and off putting. I will not say that this was the worse experience I have had but I struggle to recall any bigger letdown. I will give this place another chance but only if I happen to be nearby, starving and unable to locate a better option."
"I can't say enough good things about this place, I think I'm obsessed.  My boyfriend has a severe gluten intolerance, so any restaurant with an entire gluten-free menu is pretty exciting.  It's also the best new restaurant I've visited in a long time, I think every time I take my first bite of anything, my eyes roll into the back of my head.  I've had the bull's eye french toast, the fish tostadas, and Gluten-free boy has eaten the Los Drowned, Sloppy Goat, pancakes, corned beef hash, machos nachos, tomato-apple soup, and smoke fries. The GF menu is really quite extensive, a great find for us!Thank you Ezra, our waiter, for making our first visit easy and answering our nit-picky and extensive questions about the gluten-freeness of all the dishes.  It really gave us peace of mind!"
"This place should be called, ""The little salt shaker"".  I purchased a couple of items from their cafe on separate occasions and boy were they the saltiest things I've ever tasted. I had high hopes for this place. I never Yelp, but I was really floored with how salty the following items were: Goat Chili, Gluten free roll #1 and Gluten free roll #2, I think #2 was a Parmesan roll , but I couldn't taste it.. the cafe salad (to go) was also meh. Le Colombe has better coffee. Over it!"
"This place is very popular and now I see why.  My friend and I went on a Monday night.  We ended up at the counter no-wait, but I am glad we did because we loved catching glimpses of the food.I ordered the fish tostadas.  They were AMAZING, probably my favorite fish taco/tostada dish of all time.  The tostada was perfect, not too crispy and not the slightest bit soggy.  The battered white fish did not have a strong fishy flavor and fried to perfection.  I thoroughly enjoyed the slaw and the sauce was the cherry on top - note: it is not spicy but had a little kick (then again, i have a very low tolerance for spicy foods).  A wonderful dish that filled me up without that uncomfortable feeling.  My friend ordered the patty melt with the beef, and she enjoyed it as well.  We shared the smoked fries, which was very delicious.  However, I wished the sandwiches came with fries on the side, BUT it was worth it. For service, our waitress was great - very helpful (she recommended the fish tostadas) and sweet (she made her own concoction of honey mustard because they didn't make/have it).  Glasses were always filled and the food wait was pretty good.  The ambiance was casual and inviting.  I like the open-air feel with the skylight windows and ceilings.The only reason I docked one star is the apple pie a la mode.  The scoop of ice cream was pretty small and the apple pie was pretty average. Otherwise, another top-notch restaurant, Miss Stephanie."
"Despite what I had heard from a few people that I trust about restaurants I was really excited to visit Little Goat, which probably hurt its rating overall. Had I never heard of this place I probably would have given it 3 stars for uniqueness of the menu alone. Let's start with the positives:- Unique menu, peaks your interest and the fact that they have kimchi on several items made me feel like I was going to love the place.- Los Drowned: As far as I can tell the only reason to go to the place, pretty decent sandwich for sure.Negatives:- The food (with the exception of los drowned) was just alright. Burger was overcooked, fries were soggy, everything felt as if it had been sitting under a heat lamp.-The service was a joke, I was looking for a hidden camera. I wouldn't recommend even trying this place in a group over 4, I understand its new and there will be a wait but its not efficiently run at all. Twice the hostess pointed to a 6 top table that was ""ours as soon as it was bussed"" and twice she sat a 3 top in it. To their credit they ultimately moved one of those 3 tops to a smaller table because there was no where else to put our group of 6 (who had been waiting for over an hour). I'm sure that three top will be writing a similar review. Adding insult to injury the food took a long time to come out and the difference between the first entree and the last entree coming out was around 15 minutes. It didn't help that the last entree to come out was my burger. The positive side was I did get to try the ""los drowned"" because the people I went with felt bad for me. Finally when it was time to go the waitress went MIA for 15 minutes after all of our plates had been bussed.  For a restaurant with such a long wait they don't have much of an effort to get people in and out the door, which I suppose could be the problem to start with.Do yourself a favor and walk a few doors east to Au Cheval. Better food, better atmosphere, less wait and better service. Also better beers, which should be enough by itself."
Too greasy! I honestly couldn't even finish my meal.
"What else can I say about Little Goat that no one else has yet?It's a great place for brunch - good food, and huge portions. The prices might seem a little high at first, but when you get your plate, you'll understand why.We got the Machos Nachos and the Tonkatsu Sandwich. Machos Nachos were SO GOOD and the portion was huge. We split them between the two of us and I still had leftovers for two meals after. The Tonkatsu Sandwich was really good as well. It was actually two pork cutlet sandwiches stacked on top of each other.Spare yourself the 2 hour wait and ask for a seat at the communal table right behind the host stand - no wait and the service is just as good. Food came out fast, server was attentive and everything was as we expected. We also got to watch Ms. Izard in action on the grill!Great place, would definitely go again!"
Upscale diner that will have kimchi lovers coming back. The food is well crafted and the wait staff fits the style of the place. Besides less than optimal parking options the food is pleasurable.
"This is my first yelp review and I am writing this because I was simply disappointed with the experience I received tonight.  I should first say that I was most excited to dine at Girl and the Goat, but when I arrived, they were closed due to a private party.  I thought that this would be a great opportunity to give Little Goat a try.  When I arrived, the host team was friendly and inviting.  I was quickly seated and upon looking over the menu, I felt a bit overwhelmed.  I was confused as to which part of the menu I should start at.  I thought it would be a good idea to choose something to get the experience started.  When the server finally greeted the table, my guest ordered a diet beverage.  When she returned, a while later, I opted to order the Chopped Salad and the Mac & Cheese.   When the Mac & Cheese arrived, it was anything but hot.   When the Chopped Salad arrived, it was buried beneath a mound of shallots.  As I continued on with the salad, I had discovered more onions.  This time they were pickled, which is fine.  I enjoy pickled onions.   Moments later, I ordered 2 Sammiches.  The first was the BBQ Pork.  The second was the Korean Burger.  I took a bite of the Korean Burger and I thought it was mediocre, at that.  I then jumped over to the other side of my plate and took a bite of the BBQ Pork.  I savored the bite for a moment and then I realized a very familiar taste.  I opened up the sandwich and to my dismay, there were more onions.  This coming from an onion lover, I thought this was TOO MUCH.  I moved them aside and attempted to finish my dinner.  I wasn't as satisfied as I thought I would be.  It didn't help my experience that I had to ask 3 of the 4 times for refills for my diet soda.  When the support staff came to fill my water, he asked me how my dinner was.  I told them the truth.  I replied, ""it's just okay.""  As I finished my dinner, a manager approached the table.  He wanted to find out where I was in my experience and offered to send something out that I would enjoy.  I turned down the gesture and wanted to just wrap up this experience.   At the very end, the server offered me dessert.  I had room for dessert and would have stayed, but I thought it would be best enjoyed at home.  Upon paying the bill, I had a Girl and the Goat gift card that I had wanted to use.  She came back only to notify me that they DO NOT accept this card.  It would have to be used across the street, is what she said.  As I signed the credit card slip, I looked to the bottom of the receipt.  It simply stated...Thanks.  Come again.  I wondered to myself, Would I??"
"In a word: Excellent.... and I cannot wait to go back.This is a new place in our neighborhood and I had to try it - even if there was a wait on a Sunday morning - and there was, but it wasn't awful, just about 30 minutes.  I would love to go to Girl and the Goat, but I can never get a reservation when I want it, so I decided I will settle for Little Goat since it takes no reservations.We arrived and they have a neat system where they text your cell phone when your table is ready.  The service was slow, but I would expect it to be slow when there is a wait and every table is taken.  I did notice that they had a busboy refilling the water glasses, but only the waitress refilled the coffee.  The waitresses, though among the nicest you will ever meet, are also among the most busy you will ever know.  But they did well by us.  Every request I made was satisfied to perfection.My dining companion had the shrimp, grits mixtre and said it was superb.  I had the sourdough pancakes and they were just spectacular - far exceeding my expectations.  I also got a scrambled egg and hash browns on the side just to see how they were and I was very pleased with both of them.  Their hash browns are unique and tasty.The food was just outstanding and I cannot wait to go back and try some more.The West Loop needs more diners and this was a long time coming.  I believe the popularity of this place more than demonstrates that and the pent up demand.  however, the Little Goat is GREAT and would be popular wherever it was, but I am ecstatic it is in my neighborhood."
"Was expecting a lot considering the tie to Girl & the Goat. The rooftop was beautiful and enjoyable. However, the food overall was really disappointing. Service was good, but on the slower side. We waited over 2 hours for a table, and given the food/service, in the end it wasn't worth it. I think there are a lot of other restaurants in the area (au cheval, the girl & the goat main restaurant, etc) that would've been much more worth it!"
This place was really cool! The vibe was fun energetic and artsy.. Our server was so friendly and helpful . My wife had a sandwich that was flavorful and full of character! I had the goat burger with an egg and kimchi really good! the goat meat was a little different then what I'm used to possibly a touch tough but not bad. The hot crab dip with ritz crackers were really good! I would definitely go back!!
"I really wanted to like this place, but the food was just not very good.  I read so many good reviews about the scallion pancake and pork belly, but it just wasn't that good.  The only good thing about this place is that they serve Stumptown coffee."
"Haven't eaten at the restaurant yet but ventured in to buy some freshly baked breads and they did not disappoint.  Love walking into the bar area and watching the bakers behind the glass making all kinds of breads.    Enjoyed a beer while I waited for my loaves to be sliced, and then carried home a loaf of Duck Fat bread and Broccoli and Cheese bread.    LOVED them both and looking forward to going back for lunch or dinner.   Really nice atmosphere and the employees were great!  Very friendly!  Food LOOKED delicious!"
"So update - the bakery side has been bumming me out lately. The other week I went in at 11:15 to get some chili and it wasn't ready yet, though their site says they start serving it at 11:00am. Then today I went in at 7:45 to get a gluten-free muffin and they said it would be five minutes. I know 7:45 is early, but not for the weekday working crowd. So I decided to go with oatmeal instead, which appeared to be fine, but then the guy came back from the kitchen and said it would be an HOUR before that was ready. So I decided to wait the five minutes for the muffin, which turned out to be 15 minutes. They did give me a pretty hefty gluten free dinner roll on the house, plus everyone is always nice there and the food is great. But just heads up...don't go expecting them to have what they say they do."
"Today we went to this restaurant for breakfast. We signed up 1 hour ahead of time. It was loud and noisy and it took one hour more before they took our order.  Service was unacceptably slow.They ran out of bagels by 11:30 AM. Everything was ala carte and for eggs, bacon, coffee, a few bagels and one salad for 4 of us it was $80. When we complained they were attentive but not a dime off the bill. Three out of four of us got diarrhea.  Emperors new clothes restaurant, need I say more?"
"We loved everything about this place. The decor, the environment, and our waiter. My husband and I are huge foodies from Vegas, and this place was amazing! The hot crab dip with the Ritz crackers were my fave and their Shake is too die for. :)"
"This place is wonderful.  The food and drinks were fantastic.  Charming atmosphere.I had a ton of things go wrong accidently (two different drinks were spilled, etc) and they bent over backwards to make sure they took care of everything and reimbursed me.  They are so, so kind and gracious, which is rare in a place this popular.  They take such great pride in what they do.  Everyone from the people at the host stand, to the bartenders to the waitress and even the assistant manager were all the loveliest.Yes, the wait is long because it's fabulous, but if you go with your expectations in check it won't be bothersome.  They text you and you can check updates on your wait time and grab a drink or whatever so it's still a positive experience.  I'd only recommend going if you're prepared for that, or if you don't want to wait as long just go at a uncommon time.Overall, this place rocks."
What a fantastic concept. Every single detail was given thought. The tuna melt was excellent! The service was exceptional. Congrats Stephanie Izard and Boka Group!
"Corned beef hash, sourdough pancakes, & the mimosas are where it's at!! Although, the server did disappear for long periods of time but other than that it was great."
"LOVE IT!! Finally, a diner that has everything done just right. And thank you for bringing a real bakery to chicago!!"
"Came here on a sunday night with a couple of friends. As soon as we walked in, we were greeted and taken to a table.We started off with the tempura mashed potatoes, and it was absolutely delicious. The pickled vegetables on top added a crunch and sweetness, and the tempura provided a great texture, and then it melts in your mouth. The sauce also adds the perfect amount of acidity. I also ordered the Brandade pork belly benedict, and this was wonderful. A twist on the classic eggs benedict. The kimchi totally works. Will be coming back!"
"Go to a diner if you want diner food or go to Au Cheval if you want inspired diner food.  My husband and I went to Little Goat, it was my first time and my husband was willing to 'give it a second chance.'  What we had was the patty melt, fat club sandwich and chocolate malt shakes.  The shakes were the winner here the other items were fine but typical, which is not what I expected from Little Goat. On the first try my husband had the fried pickles and onions and chicken cordon bleu again uninspired meh diner food.Go to the Girl & the Goat if you want great food and go to a diner if you want diner food.  Don't waste your time at Little Goat."
"What a cool concept Stephanie Izard has nestled herself in. The space was clean, open, and bright... and not exactly what I picture a diner as. Now let me start off by mentioning that I had a hangover from hell the day we went so this may or may not have impaired my judgment. The bloody mary did it's job, but it was not the best bloody mary I ever had or anything. My bf and I ordered the hot crab dip that came with ritz crackers to share as an appetizer. I wanted to love this so much, but it was too salty and rich for me. It looked like velveeta! We each had burgers, I had the patty melt and my bf had the Goat Almighty and again both fell short. Everything was too salty and my bfs just seemed like too much of a lot of things that didn't work so well together. We probably ordered the wrong things for our taste buds, but my bf refuses to give it another chance because it was pretty pricey for something neither of us liked. But I loved Stephanie on Top Chef and I want to love everything she does so I'll have to bring a friend here for breakfast food!"
"Love it! Been here a few times and the wait staff are always very knowledgeable and genuine. There's usually a pretty substantial wait to be seated, but it's definitely worth it! Even if you don't like chili cheese fries, I highly recommend them here--they don't get soggy like you'd expect, and the chili is super flavorful. But the one thing you HAVE to get is the Fat Elvis waffles...you'll be in heaven."
"Very worth the 75-90 minute wait on a late Saturday morning.  My friend and I shared the Fat Elvis Waffles (peanut butter butter, sliced bananas, and bacon maple syrup), Pork Belly Pancake, and the goat cheese hash browns - everything was fantastic and there were so many other things on the menu I would have liked to order.  Will definitely have to go back at least a handful of times to try other things.  Sitting at the counter is fun, and you'll probably catch a good view of Stephanie hard at work.  And once you're able to find it, the hidden bathroom door is amusing.  Little Goat is fantastic!!!  Can't wait to go back for more."
"Outstanding food, everything was fresh with high quality ingredients and inventive preparations. Was just there once while visiting from out of town and I'd go back in a flash. Service was wonderful and friendly too."
this place suck not worth the wait or the extreme rude staff!!
Went early for breakfast on Memorial Day.  Got seated right away not that crowded.  Waited about 10 minutes for coffee even though it seemed like there was at least 1 waiter/waitress for every customer.  Staff did not seem organized.  This is a breakfast diner?  They did not have oatmeal available even though it was on the menu.  They did not have the apricot scone even though it was on the menu.  Do not order toast here.  They grill it.  Think grilled cheese minus the cheese.  Very greasy and chewy.  Meal came and it was wrong.  Please write it down the next time.  I know it looks cool but it blows up in your face if you get the order wrong.  There were a couple of positives.  Our waiter was very nice and they picked up the check for our meal.  The manager came over and apologized.  That says a lot because we were not complaining.  Suggestions:  Have some jams/jellies and invest in a toaster.  John H.
"I have recently fallen deeply in love with Girl and the Goat. So when a great friend suggested we eat here for our bachelorette weekend, I was completely down! What a great choice! We got there about 6:30 to put our name in. Conveniently, they take your name and number and text you when they are ready. They are great bars all around to get drinks while waiting! They said it would be a 60-75 minute wait which was no problem since we planned to hang out at Haymarket. Little did we know, our table was ready much sooner, but there was a text messaging issue so we finally walked over after 75 minutes. They felt so bad we had the next available table with complimentary gluten free nachos! Food- amazing! Those nachos are some of the best we have ever eaten. I am a bit biased because I am addicted to Stephanie's pickles (pickled peppers). Our entrees were all to die for! I plan on going back immediately!"
"Visited Little Goat this past weekend for brunch and overall I was pleased. First, I got there around 10:30 on Sunday and it was already running at about an hour and half wait for a party of four. I always seem to be the only person I know on time for brunch (or anything) so I was thrilled with the ""we'll text when your table is ready policy"".  This means my early riser self can come in and put in my parties' name while my slower moving friends catch up. Perfect.  The host staff which consisted of three ladies up front were immediately welcoming and friendly despite the rush. This was a big relief for me, as I already boycott many hot brunch spots because of rude attitude at the door.  With my name on the waiting list and none of my friends there anyway, I headed to the bakery side, which is separate from the diner side and has its own entrance.  Wasn't really impressed with the fancy three dollar coffee, however, I enjoyed sitting at the bar and reading the paper while waiting for the rest of my party to show up.  Again more friendly service at the bar (its tiny, maybe eight seats) and some fun gift shop type items to browse. You also get a fun a view of the bakery, which I enjoyed.  When my friends showed up we went across the street to Hay Market for Bloody Mary's while we waited.  After about an hour and 45 minutes I called them, as I had not received a text to my phone. No record of my name being on the list. Yikes. No worries, they told us to come on over and they would get us a table ASAP.  We walked in, were apologized to right away (I guess they had taken my phone number wrong) and seated. Yay! Crisis averted by excellent service. Executive Summary: Overall I found the service and friendly atmosphere to be as outstanding as at Girl and the Goat. I couldn't have been more satisfied.  The food and cocktails were good, just not amazing. We tried the Fat Elvis Waffles, Shrimp & Grits,&  Corn Beef & Hash. Now, I had CRAZY HIGH expectations from my experiences at Girl & the Goat, so this might be unfair, but I wasn't wowed by anything, which I anticipated from amazing dining experiences  at Girl & the Goat.  It was all good, just nothing to write home about.  Because of the great service and atmosphere, however, I would definitely give it another try and also return to try the dinner/lunch menu."
LoNg LiVe tHe G0aT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!Sooo excited there's now an every-day GOAT as well as a special occasion Goat! Already had three amazing breakfasts at the Lil Goat and looking forward to many many returns.
"Damn. Damn. DAMN. This is one fabulous bakery. We haven't yet gotten to eat at the diner, but I've had some wonderful bagels, coffees, and teas."
Great for lunch meetings and the food is always great.  Sometimes the wait can be annoying but usually it is no more than 10 minutes.
"I JUST left Little Goat.  The food was really good but the service was a little infuriating until we sat down. We were seriously let down by the cluster of hosts in the front of the restaurant.  We arrived a little after 6 on Saturday and were told it would be about 30-40 min. for a table, which was fine.  We put our name in and grabbed a drink at Maude's down the street. The text we received said it would be 45-1hr for our wait.  When we hit the 45 min mark we decided to walk back to the restaurant and wait for our table.  After a few min we were ushered to the back of the restaurant for ""the best table in the house."" The hostess explained that you could see the entire restaurant from this booth in the back.  We were almost there when she stopped, turned around and apologized because another couple was being seated at our table.  The hostess reassured us that we would be taken care of.  We walked back to the front and they told us it would be another 15 min.  We waited another 20 min and we received another text message saying that our table was ready so we walked up to the hostess again where she then said that it would be another 5 min because the communal tables in the front were being held for a large party and that a booth would open up soon....which did in the very front of the restaurant as close to the door as possible.  Every time the door spun I got an ice cold breeze up my skirt.  At that point I realized that there was no point in saying something.Once we sat down we had good service.  Our waiter was attentive, fast and offered suggestions when we asked for them.We had the taco salad, horseshoe burger, and onion rings - super awesome diner food taken to the next level in a non-pretentious way. The food was good but not worth the lengths we had to go through to get a table.  I hope I can update this review after another visit."
"So glad to have LG in the neighborhood. I will be back many times. My husband and I went with out out of town guests on New Years Day. Despite the wait, the service was great and I loved the set up and decor. More importantly all the food was a flavor explosion in my mouth. Glad we came with friends so we could share a bunch of dishes. I don't normally order breakfast burritos, but I decided to and I am glad I did. I have been thinking about it since I ate it. The flavor and texture combination was brilliant. My husband loved his eggs benedict. The biscuits were so light and flaky and the chicken gravy was good. The Elvis Pancakes were good but I probably wouldn't order them again. My friend didn't like the coffee. All in all great place and can't wait to have many more meals at LG and LG Bread!"
"I tried out Little Goat Bread and the Diner over New Years weekend, and there were some big hits and a few misses for me.  At LG Bread, I first tried out the goat cheese bagel with honey schmear, and it was a delicious start to my day.  The bagel rivaled those I have had in New York, and it had a great chewiness that bagels are often missing around here.  The schmear was good too, but not all that remarkable.  I also purchased a banana espresso muffin, which sounds good in theory, but it was just awful.  I only ate a little before I had to throw it out, which for someone who loves all pastries just felt plain wrong (but it was that bad)!  I don't know if it was the espresso or if someone put in too much baking powder, but there was a really bitter and off-putting flavor to the muffin.  My sis, however, tried the apple spice cake and said it was delish.  Maybe they just need to tweak the muffin...Undeterred by my muffin experience, I tried out the diner a couple days later on NYE morning, and there was no wait, which is a welcome change from Girl & the Goat.  I ordered the Fat Elvis waffles (without bacon syrup since I don't eat the swine), and it was awesome!  A very simple dish, but the waffle's perfect combination of chewiness and sweetness elevated the dish. The portion was huge too so I had half the next day for breakfast, and it was still really good.  Hubby had the biscuits and gravy, which he declared were the best he had ever had.  He's had a lot of B&Gs so that's saying something.  We also ordered the hash browns with goat cheese, and they were a bit too soggy and greasy for me.  Finally, I MUST devote a paragraph just to the fresh crumpets.  They are made to order, and are a lovely warm, buttery delight.  They were like a griddled biscuit, and I would go back just for those.  Definitely order them!!"
"Went to this place because of the reviews.  The food was good - really fun and interesting. I had Boo Boo Baise which was very tasty! Big problem for me though -   it wasmuch  too noisy.  I was with a big group and you could only hear to talk to the person across from you.  The poor waiter had to lean down to hear each order.  The noise level made this a less than ideal evening I'm afraid.  Also, our party had a vegan in it and the wait staff admitted that the vegan dishes were fried in the same oil as meat. which I guess techinically makes it non-vegan.  I reocmmend it for the food but pleas pelase someone do something about the noise!!"
"The tempura mashed potatoes were amazing (5 stars), but the other two dishes were only a ""solid good"" - french toast (with chicken) and the Asian pancake dish.  The chicken didn't compare to Paramount Room, Farmhouse or Carriage House, which have the best chicken dishes in the City.  Service was exceptional (for a diner)."
Dishes are extremely rich and flavorful and worth splitting.  Don't thing I have had anything bad here.
"I'm not a big fan.  The service was not good.  We had to wait forever for everything.  The food was okay, but not worth the price.  If the service was better I would feel better but it was sooo bad they lose two stars."
"Stephanie does not disappoint!  Get a goat burger, they are absolutely delish. AND a pork belly pancake. YUMI went with four people and we shared everything.  The only thing we didn't love, as a table, was the Boo Boo Baise.  It was good, but I think too fancy for this diner-feel restaurant.  Nicest diner I've ever seen!"
"When I walked in, I was immediately welcomed by two hosts that smiled and were friendly.  I was meeting a friend who arrived 10 minutes before me and was waiting at the bar for a table to become available for us. The craftmanship of the bar is brilliantly clever and I like that pathways are wide enough to give customers room to move comfortably.  The bartenders served me promptly and the bar was chill and agreeable.  My friend mentioned our wait was another 10 minutes but it ended up being 45-60 minutes.  I wasn't bothered because I enjoyed the ambience and the music in the bar.  However, my friend was not happy and went up to the front to ask a host when a table would be ready.  About 7 minutes later a table became available for us.  However, when we arrived at table it was full of dirty glasses and silverware.  The table was not ready but she directed us to another table that was not ready either but a busser cleared the table as fast as he possibly could. I ordered the BBQ pork sandwich and will be back. The only real complaint about the service was the waiter.  I'm in the service industry and just felt he wasn't too friendly.  Could just be an off day.  We all have them.  Again, food was scrumptious and just about licked the plate."
"This place was amazing!  We even saw Stephanie in the kitchen, working away!  The food was fantastic.  The service was great too.  Our waitress checked in regularly and had a very pleasant disposition.  At the end of the meal, a man who I presume was the manager swung by our table to check in- he was so nice.Now for the food reviews...The best thing we had (and what I have been craving every day since) were the Fat Elvis waffles.  The Parathas Burrito was also very good.  The hash browns were awesome- they were shredded, so were almost like shoestring french fries but in the form of hash browns- YUM!   The mac n cheese was delicious- the cheese they used was so good, and the crumbs on top were the perfect touch.  The cheesy garlic french bread was so good, and even better was the tomato chutney type of thing that it came withOverall - great meal, great service, and great atmosphere (music was a mix of 80's and 90's, and totally felt like we were in a diner!).Can't wait to return!!"
"Worth the 1.5 hour wait.  Coffee Bar was a great place to hang out, read the paper, have a coffee, and wait for a table.Had the Corned Beef Hash, PB and Banana Pancakes with Maples Bacon Syrup for brunch and wow...both were very flavorful...very, very good.Ordered two sandwiches to go for dinner...the Reuben and the Braised Beef sandwich...even better than the brunch items...This place knows how to do things...congrats."
"Drove by last night and discovered that it was open. Very cute!Greeted by very friendly hostesses. It was busy but didn't have too long of a wait (didn't have reservations).Huge menu. Wasn't too hungry, but wanted everything. Ended up with a couple of apps and the pulled pork sandwich. All very good. Our server was amazing. So service overall was excellent.Will return for breakfast...lunch and.......dinner. Or.... breakfast for dinner."
"Had a delightful Sunday afternoon here!! My friends and I were so excited to try this place out but were really worried about how busy it would be.  We dropped in at around 3 on a Sunday afternoon and hardly had to wait! The space was beautiful: really bright and open (totally different feel than Girl and the Goat).  There was a lively, diverse crowd of people: super casual couples, families and friends.  We split the tempura mashed potatoes and they were DELICIOUS (I mean, who can turn down deep fried buttery mashed potatoes?)My friend and I ended up splitting the Horseshoe style goat burger and the Parathas Burrito.  The burger was out of control.  I'd highly recommend the goat chili (which came piled on top of the burger!).  The burrito ended up being less exciting (and why I ultimately gave Little Goat a 4 star rating after all).  It was missing some sauce/maybe meat action, but these are the restaurant's early days so I'm going easy on them.  Overall it seems like one should stick to the hearty, indulgent food on the menu- boy do they have meat and fried figured out.  I'll definitely be coming back! So many other delicious sounding items to try!"
"The cutest restaurant ever.  The spinning little goat on top of the restaurant is perfect. You walk in and the energy hits you. We sat at the bar for a quick lunch that was amazing.  The menu is huge and has anything you'd want.  I want to go back for these sourdough pancakes.  Oh and our server, Ezra... Amazing.  Go Ezra!  I will definitely be back :)"
"Excellent nachos, burgers, mac&cheese, desserts, beers, and cider!!! Hope no one will get a heart attack there!"
"Okay, if you're on a diet, this is not the place for you.  Little goat is a place to splurge!  Everything is so rich and tasty w/ a lot of flavor.  Our table tried the fried pickles and onion rings and the crisp shrimp cocktail.  The fried pickles and onion rings were average (Lilly Q's has the best fried pickles).  The shrimp cocktail was fried to perfection and I would definitely try it again.  I had the BLT with Avocado and it lived up to expectations.  However, I'm glad I didn't have a cholesterol check the next day.  Wow...  did it have a lot of EVOO in the bread (tasty as ever, but maybe a little too much).  My significant other had the Los Drowned and said it was TASTY and would order it again.  For desert we tried the smoked pork and toffee crunch shake.  Let me start off by saying the shake had an interesting flavor.  At first I didn't like it, but, of course, I went back for more.  Once all the flavors married together, I couldn't stop eating it.  We ended up on their rooftop and were pleasantly surprised.   Little Goat is definitely worth a try."
"So delicious! We got the reuben, fish tostadas, tiramisu shake, and full bourbon jacket. The food was all so good. Reuben was tasty and fish tostadas were fresh. Every other bite ended with ""Mmm.."". While we were waiting for our food, we were looking at other people's orders. If only we had more space in our stomach, we would've ordered a few more different dishes. Thanks Chicago for the amazing food experience!"
The kale and chickpea salad is amazing! And so is the cocktail shrimp! This place may be greasy and not the healthiest at times but it has grown on me! I also loved the shrimp and grits for brunch.
"The menu is quite large, and the one downside to that is that not everything is on the same level of greatness as others.  Having been there several times now, I find myself not wanting to try new things anymore for fear of being disappointed with it not being as delicious as my ""go to"" items which include the Bulls Eye French Toast,  Brenade and Belly, Pork Belly Pancake, and the Fried Chicken.  But with a menu this is expansive, there is definitely something for everyone.   Their bakery is really good too, and their rooftop seating is a cool place to kill time if there is a wait."
"I went with very high hopes as they have a ""Marzocco"" espresso machine (basically, it cannot get any better than that). Unfortunately, the cortado was served in cardboard cup although I was sitting at the bar. I asked for the coffee to be poured in proper cup and the staff accommodate this but the cup was cold and they used the previous shot instead of a new one. Some attention must be put as these are the basics for pouring a decent coffee (especially if you have such a great machine). On the bright side, the micro foam was nearly perfect and the place itself really cool. Hopefully this was due the barista still getting used to the place so I'll be back and update accordingly.  All the best!"
Beef sandwich should be added to the vegan menu considering the amount of beef in the sandwich.
"The only bad part of the meal was when I finished the tofu sammich and I didn't have any more sammich because it was so good that I'm pretty sure little hummus angels  were flying around my table and singing the glories of tofu and hummus and goat cheese and the best bread/bun that has ever happened in the history of baked goods.  Oh, and then I was sad again when we were so full that we couldn't get a milkshake.  So basically you should eat here if you want to experience hummus angels."
We had our company party on the rooftop here last month and it was amazing! Great food and drinks and great service. Would highly recommend it.
"Please everyone, relax with the groupie 4-star ratings.  I dropped in here because someone told me to check out the Diner and the bread/coffee/shakes were good so I said why not?  Went with a dude friend of mine and he was visiting from the burbs, and well...let's be honest, the location is great and the venue does have a cool feel to it.  But I understood completely the wait...1 hour, whatever...no big deal.  While we waited, I checked out the Coffee area and beginning with the Coffee selection, umm...coffee from Seattle?  No thanks.  I have enough local roasters to spend $15 bucks for a 1/2 lb of coffee.  No thanks.  As for the bakery products, tried a couple of bread items while we waited for our seat.  I give this a 4 star....I admit the bread is legitimate but overall, nothing much to cry about to visit this place for coffee/bread.  I had a cup of latte, and it tasted a bit like Caribou like....again, not only is it well above the price-mark of a moderate priced coffee shop, the espresso in my latte wasn't anything that blew me away.  And why are they selling soaps and shit?  It's a bit weird man to buy toiletry shit at a place that sells bread and coffee.  Fine...sell it, but maybe I'm just a prick for calling you guys out on this.  As for the people who seat you, need to get some communication classes going man...not much to talk to them about, they think they are in New York at some high-end restaurant...relax girl, it's just a diner....not some fancy french joint.  Food?  Well...after finally getting seated...picked a couple of things - Salty...Salty...Salty.  Only thing that I liked were the fries, but $5 bucks for a handful of fries is a bit crazy, think i will stick w/ five guys.  As for your shakes...well, i tried the chocolate malt and it didnt taste any different than Steak N' Shake.  So $6 something for a mediocre shake was not worth it.  Needless to say, not planning to hitting this joint anytime soon again...I'm sure these guys will do well, people love waiting for their table...in a cool trendy location/venue....with lots of hipsters serving you food and stuff.  Also, I will make sure to tell Bed, Bath & Beyond customers to hit your location up for some soap."
"If you are hungry and truly want to enjoy a unique breakfast experience - you will not go wrong with this venue.  Traveling from Southern CA and on a quest to try all of Chicago's best diners, i ordered the corn beef hash - truly superb!  The only thing better was Morgan, who made the suggestion and served it with perfection."
"We came here for a birthday dinner last night (a Monday) @ 630 pm, without a reservation. Given the buzz surrounding Top Chef winner Stephanie Izard and The Girl and the Goat, and not having eaten her food yet, I had high expectations without knowing what exactly to expect. We didn't have to wait for a table for a party of three. The decor is upscale diner. The booths are padded with comfy dark brown leather; I felt like I was sitting on a well-worn, well-made couch. Drinks anyone? I cannot remember, or find online, the name of my drink but it has vodka and chambord and tastes like a lighter version of a screwdriver. We also ordered The Jazz Singer, which has bourbon in it. My accomplice said it was delicious but on the boozy side. We shared fried pickles and onion rings. They were perfectly done and both the ranch and curry mayo accompanying them were so delicious and addicting that we would have been happy eating them alone. The hash browns were good but a little too greasy and probably the most unmemorable thing I ate there. Entrees: Wing burger with a veggie patty, spiced apple pancakes and the Los Drowned sandwich. My accomplices thoroughly enjoyed the first two. The bite of apple spiced pancakes I had was delicious, a good balance of savory and sweet, much different than your typical, overly sweet local diner pancakes--we barely drizzled any maple syrup on them. The owner of the wing burger could not stop commenting on how yummy the wing sauce was. I was blown away by the perfection on a hoagie roll that is Los Drowned. The beef was perfectly braised and gorgeous. The combination of the avocado, buttercase cheese, pickles and spicy mayo made for a balanced, creamy, flavorful mouthful. The sandwich came with a vinaigrette-like dressing (apple cider, maybe?) that gave it all the sweet, acidic touch it needed to excite my palate with each bite. I think I said ""wow"" after every bite. It was so good I almost cried. I thought about it all day today, I kid you not. Nothing I ate in the last 24-hrs. could compare. It was, hands down, the best sandwich I've eaten in my entire life. We wanted to have dessert but we had nowhere to put it. We shared the complimentary birthday sundae. Our server was knowledgeable, friendly and funny. The busboys were on top of things. Our water glasses were never less than half full. Three cocktails, two sides, three entrees. Bill before a generous tip: $87. I would eat here again in a heartbeat. A great place to take off your tie and meet a friend for dinner after work or to impress that special someone. This is easily one of my new favorite restaurants. I can't wait to go back! Grade: A-."
"If the server was as attentive as the rest of the staff were as they were trying to push us out, then we would have enjoyed the underwhelming and overpriced cuisine. However, the interior design was great!"
Fat Elvis waffles are the bomb.
"I want to go back now!!  OMG, it's all delicious and there are a whole lot of great menu items to choose from.  I started with a bloody mary & it was perfect - the stuffed olive is a great treat.  I was between the fish tostadas (crisp whitefish . shallot aioli . chickpea 'n onion salad . harissa vinaigrette), parathas burrito (indian flatbread . sunny side eggs . avocado-bean salad . chili pepper sauce . sheep's milk cheddar), and the fat club (smoked turkey . ham . bacon . butterkase cheese . avocado . cabbabge & tomato . mayo . special sauce . fat toast), thanks to the suggestion from our sweet server, I ordered the fish tostadas and it was beyond amazing!  The flavors come together perfectly and I actually ate every bite which never happens.  My friend ordered the pork belly pancake (scallion pancake . house hoisin . bok choy salad . ginger maple dressing) and oh boy that could definitely be a contender on what to order next time.  Can't wait to try it again or bring out of towners here.  YUMS - hats off to Stephanie and her crew!!"
Loved the Sloppy Goat sandwich!  Definitely looking forward to trying more items on this delicious menu.
"Pathetic attempt at creativity.  This restaurant uses the popularity of its sister restaurant to serve reconstituted french freezer food and rip-off the Big Boy menu.  People must be so bored that they turn to places like this for amusement..  We waited hours hungrily anticipating something new, something that breaks through glass it is so new and delicious.  I would have been more satisfied by a Baconator at Wendy's.  They even take credit for the Big Mac sauce! The low lighting and rich people at the trendy bar don't fool me.  This place sucked."
"Update:  A recent return trip, the boyfriend and I had two wonderful dishes, the bulls eye french toast, and the paratha burrito.  Since I kind of believe in redemption, I will update accordingly to a slightly higher rating.  I still dislike paying customers getting sub par products, so I still stand by my original notes and experiences.The bread side is good, but I expected more from the Diner, given the restaurant's family heritage...At the diner, we had the ""los drowned"" beef sandwich, and the ""tonkatsu"" asian inspired pork sandwich, both left us wanting more flavor.  The tonkatsu, being the less pleasing of the two, didn't taste like anything, and was on pretty lackluster white bread.   At least the beef tasted beefy, but it was a big fat greasy mess with few high notes.  The fried pickles and onions were lacking, especially the pickles, which got lost in the tempura style batter, luckily the dipping sauces were tasty.  For dessert, the smoked pork and toffee crunch shake was awfully thin, leaving the solid candy bits sinking to the bottom.  The whipped cream on top was nothing special.  The menu is large, and few restaurants can execute a large menu well, so maybe these dishes are not the best, but then they should be removed and/or replaced.  The ancient ale from Dogfish head was very good.  The restaurant was quite loud, and conversation became fatiguing through the din.The bread side offers some redemption.  Most breads and breakfast pastries are fairly good, and I suspect they'll improve over time.  The sweet onion brioche is nice.  Some breads are excessive, however, like the chicken noodle soup bread, and the bacon gouda bread.  Bread need not taste like chicken bullion, and large chunks of bacon are not necessary.  The plain bagel with honey masala cream cheese was delightfully different and enjoyable.  The coffee from Stumptown is good, but the baristas need training in order to consistently turn this excellent coffee into well crafted espresso beverages.I like the Girl and the Goat, and the Boka Restaurant Group, so I hope I can revise this at a later date with more positive things, but for now, I'll stick to the bread side of Little Goat."
Food and service are both excellent!  Love the fish tostadas.  Appreciated the staff accommodating my little nephews' need to move.. gave us a both that they could crawl under and around for our hour of dining.
Awesome sandwich and great rooftop bar.  Reasonably priced.
"If you eat breakfast here in the morning, you may not eat the rest of the day.  Portions are very large.  I had the sourdough pancakes, after being assured that they were not on the menu just to have a pancake on the menu.  Excellent.  Outstanding.  Also, the housemade sausages were great.  The cinnamon roll was shared and really good.  One thing to remember, on weekends, this place fills up fast.  Get there early or bring a paper or two or a e-reader, grab a cup of coffee at the adjacent bar/bakery and sit in for a wait."
"The food was good, but did not taste amazing. It was a interesting place to try but I would not go back again. The waitress took forever and took us half hour to get our bill."
Definitely worth the stop. Went in early on a Saturday night (about 5:45 - 6:00 PM) and we were seated right away. The place started filling up fast but our service was not affected. I got the American burger with mac 'n' cheese and my husband got the chicken tenders with mashed potatoes. Both were incredible! I absolutely loved the decor and vibe - a blast from the past with a modern twist. They also have a rooftop that is worth checking out if the weather is cooperating.
