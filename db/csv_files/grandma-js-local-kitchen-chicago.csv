Grandma J’s Local Kitchen
"Grandma J's now serves dinner Thursday through Saturday.  The food and staff are amazing.  I have been a fan of the brunch restaurant for a while but I have not taken the time write a review.  Tonight, I was dining with my family including kiddos 4 yrs old and 2.  The dinner menu is great - fried chicken, homemade pasta, trout and a bunch of other tasty dishes.  The waiter also offered a menu for the kids (pasta, hotdogs and a few other items.)  It was not overly busy so when we asked about the possibility of plain yellow mustard for our youngest, the staff left to grab some from a nearby grocery store.  How amazing is that?  I have always felt like I was lucky to have found the Humboldt Park neighborhood and make it the home for my family but Grandma J's is definitely the icing on the cake.  The staff makes you feel right at home and the food is just as great!"
"Clocks aren't the first thing that come to mind when I think of grandmas, but this place somehow got it spot on. From my paternal grandmother's plastic yellow bumble bee clock to my maternal grandmother's loudly ticking wood clock that was always set fifteen minutes fast, there's something about the zillion clocks on the wall at Grandma J's that made me feel at home. That, and the fact that the waiter offered to refill my iced coffee for free!I got the Works, which had two poached eggs, bacon, hollandaise sauce, kale, mushrooms, and a fried (red) tomato over potato hash. It also came with a side of toast, butter, and pineapple jam. Part of me worried that this would be too many ingredients for one dish, but it somehow all worked. Even the ever-nutritious kale didn't detract from the deliciousness of the hollandaise and bacon.My brunch mates got the chicken and waffle fritters and the breakfast sandwich. I tried the fritters and they were kind of dry. I'll be back to try the French toast sticks and enjoy some BYOB mimosas."
"We stood at the front for about fifteen minutes before someone came to seat us.  Sat at the table for like a half hour before someone came over.  Waited another eternity for the food to arrive.  Waited another eternity for them to take our money.  I am all for the ""slow food"" revolution but this was ridiculous. The deviled eggs were awesome.I got a breakfast plate called ""The Works"" which was a mish-mosh of breakfasty things.  It was salty beyond belief.  Sooooo much salt.  It was almost inedible but I was totally starving.  Overpriced, overrated, dirty floors, and absolutely pathetic service.  I probably wouldn't go back here.  Afterwards, we spent some time making fun of it."
"Prepare to wait (not for a table but for your food)! This is a place good for catching up with old friends, because you'll have to wait a long time for your food. Cash ONLY. Very hot inside with a lot of flies. No A/C and door open. It adds to the charm of the place. Suppose to feel like you're at Grandma's which I respect.Food:The Works: Pretty good. Fried Green Tomato Benedict: Not bad. Overall, the food wasn't bad but also not mind blowing enough for me to come back and wait an hour for. Also it's not cheap. I do respect what they're trying to do with the whole chill and enjoy your company vibe."
"Great place in Humbolt Park. Incentive dishes with ingredients that you'll feel good about eating.  Local farms, grass fed meats, etc. plus great offerings like kombucha drinks for a bit of a twist.  We had ""the works"" breakfast plate which was a mix of veggies, cheese, bacon, and poached eggs in a bowl. Home run. Very tastey and filling. We also the Chilaquiles with a poached egg. Was a little dry fore but I didn't like the flavor and the eggs were perfectly done. Not as much for kids as we would of liked for breakfast but it wasn't horrible either (the chef made us a special pancake with a waffle batter). Two other things of note:1 it's BYOB. Bring your vodka and they'll give u a home made Bloody Mary mix. 2 cash only. Would come back to try more since I liked this joint."
"What can I say here that hasn't already been said? The work that is being done in this little kitchen is among the best in the city, especially in the ever important byob brunch space.This is the kind of place that could literally charge double, and you would still be happy. But they don't, and that is the other half of the charm here. There's something just so inviting about a local joint, with real people running it, turning out top level food.Owner Layla is always there with a smile of some kind, and along with her warm staff, they make you feel more like neighbors and friends than customers.The Fried Chicken and Waffle Fritters might not only be the best brunch dish in the city, but maybe even the best fried chicken. The breakfast poutine, biscuits and well... everything else is just on point.If you want to go someplace for brunch without a side of pretentiousness, then get your ass to Grandma J's!"
"Still love this place. While there was a 30-40 minute wait this morning and no room inside to wait, the hostess offered us coffee while we were outside. Not a super cold day, but chilly enough where hot coffee was appreciated. Decided to try something new today. Went with The Works and it was amazing. Poached eggs with kale, cheddar cheese, potato hash, hollandaise sauce, a tomato and bacon. I loved it and it was so filling.They've also acquired an ATM and two tables that replaced a coach and coffee table seating since my last visit."
Ate here for the first time today after searching for a good place to eat brunch that had some unique items. Grandma Js did not disappoint at all. The staff is friendly and attentive. The space is quaint and comfortable but not too crowded given its size. And the food was fantastic. I had The Works and it was amazing. The perfect amount of food and everything came so well together. Will definitely be eating here again.
"This place is a mecca for delicious food.We went on my bday brunch.  I have been stalking it on Yelp for awhile now.  It did not disappoint.Fried pickles...a bit soggy, but still goodB&G...might be the best I have ever had.  I am salivating thinking of them right nowFried chick sand...yummy!  Crispy chick with tender and juicy meat.  Some of the best bread I have had.The Works...it just worked.  AmazingnessThe staff are some of the nicest people.  I was shocked by the hospitality here.Super cute homey, place.  Go, eat, this place cant be beat."
"Service was amazing, small room but atmosphere was fantastic.. I had ""The Works"" and it was phenomenal, the waffle fritters are great and the coffee was surprisingly delicious.. Over all. 10/10. Thanks again Grandma J!!!"
"I just had my first meal here. Quite delicious. I had ""The Works"" which is served in a bowl. It has cheesy baked potatoes topped with fried kale, bacon two eggs with hollandaise sauce, and a fried tomato. Excellent with their home made hot sauce. Super high quality ingredients. Although many of the ingredients are fried, the overall dish was not greasy.. Kind of a hangover goers dream.A very LARGE PORTION. I'll ask if I can split it next time. With tax came out to $15 ish... not inexpensive but worth it. The entire menu looks great. Breakfast and lunch only.They have a BYOB bloody mary option.. Just bring your own vodka and the remaining ingredients are 5$."
"The best place I've ever been at humbold park and totally one of my favorites through Chicago.They have a tiny space, I think it was around 3 tables and a patio. Service was amazing - everyone was super friendly and still not annoying.They have beautiful old photos on walls.Food was awesome. Loved everything.Totally coming back."
"Awesome atmosphere, very welcoming and inviting staff.   We came on a Sunday for brunch amd it was a wait but the food was amazing! We had the morning sandwich and the sausage hash breakfast.   We were very impressed and will definitely be back! It's a nice place to invite a friend and reconnect while you wait!"
"Our waiter Jon was great,  he held it down by himself.  We all got the chicken and waffles and it was fantastic."
"I need to go back here again! I came on a whim and I gotta say, the service was great and the food was awesome!I got the Works which was poached eggs on top of potato hash with Swiss cheese marinated mushrooms , crispy kale, bacon and fried tomato in a bowl comes with toast, and some jam. All delicious! I also paired with some coffee (which they had to keep brewing but always fresh).It's a small place and it gets packed but it's very great! I just sat at the bar."
"I'm sure you can tell from my previous reviews, that a restaurant's atmosphere makes a big difference to me as a diner.  Grandma J's and its diners are a bit too hipster for my taste, which is why I just can't give a full five-star review.  This place is in the middle of nowhere and it's always packed.  You'll definitely wait more than 30 or 45 minutes on a Saturday or Sunday after 10, especially if you have a party larger than two, so just prepare for that.  And there's NO WHERE ELSE for you to go nearby to wait (i.e. to have a beer or watch football or something), so plan on just standing outside in the cold.  Cash only also makes this place incredibly annoying instead of charming, so keep that in mind.  At least there's ample parking available for free.  Only redeeming atmospheric quality of this place.  The servers are pretty curt  and clearly annoyed that their restaurant is constantly full and diners have all kinds of annoying dining preferences like gluten-free vegan nonsense.  The general feeling in the place is ""hurry up and order and eat so we can get more people at this table"", which doesn't make me feel comfortable.  Sigh.  The people just don't make this place worth it.The food, though, was really good.  I appreciate organic, free-range, local meats and whatnot, and they are clearly prideful of their purchase of these kinds of items.  The breakfast sandwich was excellent and everything comes with potatoes and meat of some kind, so indulge away.  My family really enjoyed everything they ordered (we were a party of six) and the coffee was refilled promptly.  Prices are reasonable but, sigh, it's cash only.  I won't come back here on purpose, but would definitely go with a friend if they suggested it.  Maybe my next experience will be better.  At least the food was super delicious."
"Yelped a good breakfast place while on vacation and found this place. Anything with ""grandma's"" has to be good!The interior here is decorated so cute! It really looks like grandma collected a bunch of things and left it all here.There are old schools games and books on the shelf for you to play while you wait for your food. Also, gum in jars on every table.Time for the food!The boyfriend had The Works that looked good and came with house made pineapple jam that was too sweet for me but my brother liked.I had the Poached Hamboldt. Poached eggs over ~~~ all over delicious potatoes!! Loved! And the portion was perfect if you didn't get extra french toast like I did.The texture of the french toast was good but it was a bit greasy and I did not like the white sauce they put on top.I like when places have non-matching cups and this was how the coffee cups were. The water they give you in the masion jar was warm though so it was kind of gross. So I ordered a Peach-Mango juice that my brother said he saw just came out of a V8 bottle.I would love to come back here next time I'm in town and possible try the biscuits and gravy which they were out of. The waitress told us as soon as we walked in instead of after we looked at the menu.They are also looking for burlesque dancers if anyone is interested!"
"I was not impressed with this trendy single waitress breakfast and lunch eatery. I've got plenty of details and photos to explain my views. We arrived just after 11am to a few open tables. There are just six small tables that would each hold either two or four people, two tables for up to six people, and a small bar-like counter that holds a total four people. Capacity here is limited but the flow for lunch here never exceeded capacity. The waitress (one chef, one waitress) seated us but wasn't overly friendly. This visit would have likely gone so much better if she had simply asked ""Have you been here before?"" but we were given no rules or SOP's and remained clueless most of the visit. I would ask questions that I thought of but turned out I had missed a bunch. Being one waitress she had little time for us and was rarely available to help when needed. Even by the end of the meal the waitress still seemed stressed and unfriendly. Both of us started with hot tea. The tea bag selection was nice but my companion likes a weak tea and when she pulled out the bag to save it for a second cup there wasn't a saucer and the only place to put the partially used bag was the sticky table. The table didn't seem dirty but just old and worn. There are a couple menus listed on Yelp. They are clearly outdated and inaccurate. The stuff we wanted (some nice sounding chicken sandwiches) that we picked on Yelp before arriving wasn't on the menu we got. Check the official restaurant website for the current menu!I LOVE anything made with duck so I jumped at the Duck 3 Way (see photo) and for $14 I was expecting a more traditional confit (seasoned and moist from being stored in fat) but I got a small amount of dry duck meat chunks. The poached duck egg was good and larger than I expected. The potato hash fried with duck fat was under seasoned but the duck fat added good flavor. The Hollandaise sauce was good but more lemony than I like. I wouldn't get this dish again even if it were priced under $10. My companion had to put together three sides to make a meal since the full menu was a bit limited. Sides of French Toast, Bacon, and Potato Hash. The four small French baguette slices were the best tasting things we had for lunch today. Bacon was good and hash average.Our check was over $30 for underwhelming food and below par service. We knew that it was CASH ONLY prior to arriving so that wasn't an issue but the cost for what we got was. On a side note for the profit they rake in here could easily cover a credit card system through their bank or even using a Square type credit service with a simple smart phone. Just one way to improve customer service here."
SO good. This little gem is in the most unexpected spot but it is divine. Such friendly people serving the most delicious food. Unexpected deliciousness. You must go.
"The Works is delicious! Love the pictures of all the ""grandma's"" when they were young."
"Can't wait to come back.  Went to Grandma J's on a Friday morning after picking up my cousins who were in from New Orleans at the airport.  First stop was Grandma J's since you can't bring people accustomed to New Orleans food just anywhere to eat. We decided to try out Grandma J's based on the reviews and location.  So glad we did!  Awesome service and even better food.  We had the fried pickles and deviled eggs to start.  Then I had The Works but prepared gluten free (lowers my head as I admit to being THAT person...) my husband and cousin had the chicken and waffle sliders and I cannot remember what the other dish ordered was but it was just as good.  Everyone was raving about their meal.  Well thought out dishes, strong coffee and great service.  We will be back!"
"A wonderful and creative little gem of a restaurant on the edge of one of the most beautiful parks in the city of Chicago.  Also, it is a worthwhile and short detour off of the new 606 trail."
Amazing! best breakfast in town!
The chicken and waffles here are amazing! When ever my husband and I decide we want to withdrawal money for the cash only place we eat here. The service is great the food is great and there is hardly any noise. Will actually be there Saturday. My husband has had the fish and chips along with BLT. He is picky about how the fish is cooked so that is always the first item he orders. He loved it. Every once in awhile they do a burlesque show.
"I can see why people like this place, but you have to love kale, mushrooms, etc to appreciate their cooking. Everything tasted fresh and healthy, and the service was great (we were the only people there, probably because the hours were incorrect on Yelp & Google.) We filled up on pancakes and fritters before our food came. Cash only is a pain, even though there is an ATM on site. As a business owner, I get it."
"I heard great things about this place. Unfortunately it was not a very good experience. They were out of chicken, steak, deviled eggs, all soups and soda. (At the point they should have just closed for the day).- literally everything we asked for was out. The waitress was nice but left before we received our food, we were a bit confused if our orders were even put in. My food wasn't even what it described on the menu and it took over two hours. Needless to say I won't be going back. Probably the worst dining (brunch) experience I have ever had."
"Awesome BYOB spot. Great wait staff made the place feel awesome immediately. Neat menu with plenty of vegetarian options if that's your thing, including some really tasty kambuchas and virgin bloody marys (bring vodka if you like, they'll hook you up). Cash only, though."
"Layla,Five of us went to Grandma J's about 10 am Saturday November 22nd, 2014.  The male host, server was at one of the only two occupied tables talking to patrons and instead of telling us to  sit anywhere, told us to give him a moment, all ok so far, but then when he came over to us and we asked for the unoccupied window table, he told us that on ""Saturdays, we have assigned seating"", we were given the table directly behind it and he went off to do something.  While we waited for him to come back, we all looked at each other and said, 'Assigned Seating!"", really??  As we got up to leave, he arrived with water and told him, ""we just want to make sure you have enough assigned seating"" !We certainly did not feel welcome...  And will never know if the food is any good. So sad."
"This place is absolutely awful. THE WORST. I've actually never experienced such disgraceful service-- or disgusting attitudes-- in ten years of living and eating in Chicago.My husband and I were looking forward to trying Grandma J's-- despite the bad things we had heard about the owner's attitude, we were ready to give it the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately we had a bad experience from the moment we walked in and sat at the bar. The owner was berating a couple of her kitchen staff-- very loudly, and nastily-- for taking cans of Coke from the fridge while they were working. She then demanded that they dig in their pockets and pay her on the spot! Chastising and humiliating one's staff in front of customers is totally unprofessional--and it made us feel very uncomfortable.Nevertheless, we ordered coffee and two breakfasts. And waited. And waited. And watched as table after table (who had arrived after us) were served. For over 50 MINUTES!!! The guy sitting next to my husband at the bar arrived 25 minutes after us...and was halfway through the *very same* breakfast that my husband had ordered when we finally decided that enough was enough. We put down cash to cover the coffee and told the owner that we were leaving because we couldn't wait any longer-- it had been almost an hour. Instead of apologizing, she turned to us with an insipid sneer and said ""You're wrong-- we bring out orders in the exact order they come in."" When we pointed out all the many tables who had come in after us had almost finished their meals she flat-out denied it in such a bratty, childish way it made my skin crawl. Clearly lots of other Yelp reviewers have had a similar experience. Until this nasty woman cleans up her act, we'll be telling everyone we know to avoid this place like the plague."
"I live one block away from this restaurant so I take all of my friends and family here when they come to visit. It never lets me down. I think I have had everything on the menu at this point and you really can't go wrong with any choice, but if I had to pick favorites: -the works-biscuits & gravy (only on weekends)-BYOB mimosa platter or bloody Mary-pancakesDefinitely go if you have the chance. You will not regret it."
"Grandma J's is my favorite place in Humboldt Park to brunch (yeah I use that word as a verb). Charming is the perfect word to describe it. It's teeny, so you must time it right on the weekend to get a table (pre-normal brunch times, but it is worth getting up early).The food is made to order just feet from you. I enjoy the Morning Breakfast sammich and The Works. A must try? The waffle fritters!I think brunch without booze is pretty much pointless so do make sure you BYO champers or prosecco (any fizzy wine will do) for the Mimosa Tray! 3 juices = lots of fun mixing and matching!"
"I went to Grandma J's Local Kitchen because of the reviews I read, and if those reviews were not favorable I wouldn't have gone to this restaurant. The food was OK, I ordered the Asparagus Benedict it took about 20mins for my husband and I to get our food. But that's not a bad thing if the food is hot when its served but it wasn't, and that doesn't sit well with me. My husband ordered the burger with poached eggs, I don't remember the menu name for the dish. But maybe that's the reason it took awhile before we received our order, and that's fine if whenever I get my food it is hot. I'm a stickler for having my food hot when it is served. The waitress did not top off my coffee until she was serving some other customers who happened to come in well after we did, and did I mention they received their food first! And last but not least, when it was time to pay my husband went to the register and stood there while the waitress was having a conversation with a customer and my husband had to walk a couple of steps back to the table where we were sitting to get her attention and she saw him get up in the first place but she never turned her head to see if he was standing there and she should have because she had just given us the check. Bottom Line I Would Not Recommend Grandma J's Local Kitchen P.S. My husband and I are a Bi-racial couple and we are both minority. Hummm......"
Great food and great service. Organic and locally grown. Conscious restaurant that's in tune with foodies. Definitely a break from the norm!
The food was ok. I really enjoyed the decor more than anything. The wait was quite long.
A couple friends and I checked out this place for the first time today and just let me tell you the food is great!!!! They were busy and we waited like 20 minutes but it was totally worth the wait! Heads upIt's cash only and they don't separate checks which was no big deal to us.. They kept the coffee coming which made me happy! Check this place out!
"Grandma wants you to be happy youtube.com/watch?v=9LKe… No, you won't find hot PR girls with pitchers of beer, midgets on stick horses, or Chubbs Peterson playing the piano, but this Grandma will have you hitting the long ball just the same with her little neighborhood breakfast/ lunch spot. It's the cutest little place that really does remind you of your nanna. The food is amazing, affordable and unique and the staff provides you with the type of service that will makes you love supporting a local biz. Try the works, a cup of coffee, and be prepared to feel like family at this hidden gem."
"Sorry grandma but grandma j puts your cooking to shame.  Danny W and I made ourselves right at grandma's adorable house. Grandma J is clearly trying to fatten us (and the rest of Chicago up) because there's not many healthy options on the menu. I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was worth every mile I will have to run to work it off.Grandma J is a cash only type of gal so be sure to stop at an ATM on your way."
"I love this place. As you step in the door, this place is bound to warm your heart.  The vintage farm girl ambience is a lovely thing to wake up to, especially for brunch.  The community tables are a fun nuance that allows for some light conversation from happy strangers while we can all enjoy and marvel at our delicious eats.  The staff is friendly and attentive, always happy to suggest their daily favorite. The menu is always changing, except, of course, for a some staple dishes-- like the chicken and waffles, for example.  With each new dish I have here, I want only to come back and continue to try what's next.  The portions are perfect and the food is just downright tasty. Comforting, hearty, fresh, and healthful--not to mention, reasonably priced.  There are great vegetarian options, too. Go go go"
"GREAT FOOD, Feels like eating in grandmas kitchen. Went for brunch."
Went there and it felt like somebody's outdated kitchen.  Food was ok.  Service was good though.
"I love this place. Perfect comfort all around. Simple and cozy atmosphere. I loved the Grandma J inspired decor--ceramic owl lamp, vintage salt and pepper shaker collection. The silverware rolls placed in a variety of different coffee mugs on each table place setting was a nice detail. The food was delicious. The egg I ordered was the best egg I have ever tasted. I prefer thicker and softer French toast, but if you like French toast sticks, these are great, crispy and buttery. My husband ordered the works. All of it was delicious. The kale is a nice addition. The portions were small for my husband but just right for me. We will definitely be returning."
I can't remember the last time I had food this delicious outside of my moms kitchen. I had gravy and biscuits with potatoes. Usually gravy and biscuits are heavy and greasy. But my meal was simply amazing. It tastes fresh and had some serious flavor. The staff was very welcoming.  And the music playing was upbeat but not too loud. And to make this place great....it's BYOB!! I honestly had a great dining experience here and would come back over and over again. It wast packed at all. We walked right in were quickly served. The food did take a whole to come but they gave us a fruit plate. But honestly food should take a bit to be served. It's fresh food. Who wants something to comes out in seconds. But overall you must visit while in Chicago. I'm surprised it doesn't have more reviews. Can't wait to come back!!
"Everything blew my mind. The atmosphere, the food, the burlesque, the DJ, the people. Grandma J's is doing their own thing, and doing it well and with lots of love. Already recommending dinner and a show to friends, and I want to go back for brunch rrrul soon."
"This place has really amazing food!We got there at 11 am on Saturday and there was no wait at all to be seated. It's BYOB so we can prepared with a bottle of vodka for bodies and champagne for mimosas. It looked like There were only 3 people working: kitchen, server, busser - so the service was SO SLOW. We had to wait forever just to get our order taken.  I was actually pretty crabby and hungry when the food arrived, but it was SO good I immediately forgave the bad service. Worth the wait. Delicious. Definitely going back"
"So frustrated by this place!  We were told the wait would be 15 minutes when we arrived.  We waited 40 minutes.  They serve you complimentary fruit when you arrive, but neglected to serve us.  After ordering, we waited an additional 45 minutes for our food, and actually saw tables ahead of ours get their food before us.  There was no recognition of this by the staff.  The waffle fritters were straight up burned.  The french toast and grilled cheese were good and it was clear that the kitchen takes pride in (most of) its food.  Those things get a star. I haven't written a review in ages but really needed an outlet for my frustration.  I hope someone from management reads this review and becomes more cognizant of these service-related foibles.  Once those get ironed out, I think this place would be awesome.  However, life is too short to wait 90 minutes all told for food so I will not be back.Also, although the young lady serving us was abrupt (because she had EVERY SINGLE TABLE to serve all by herself), the young man who was in charge of serving food and refilling coffee was really delightful.  He gets a star."
"I wasn't sure what to expect when we walked into Grandma J's, but I was pleasantly surprised by the eclectic nature of the place.  We were seated pretty quickly at a community table and were soon joined by another couple.  The menu is awesome, and I had a hard time deciding what to order.  I finally went with the morning sandwich sans bacon.  It was fantastic. My boyfriend got the works, which also looked amazing.  I can't wait to go back and try more of their menu."
"....they were out of alot of the choices I kept picking, :-( ....service took forever, we sat down & I believe it took 15 min just to get a menu, then another 20min to get our orders in.....about 45 min to get finally our food.....Now I can discuss the food,  I loved the breaded pickle & omg the jam for the toast amazing.... (give me a bottle) I had the works n I loved it....food was great just the service threw me off....will b back hopefully they will have what I wanted to begin with..I give them 4 stars b/c im giving it to the food n presentation itself...awesome"
"I went there a while back with the wife for lunch. Great service, a knowledgeable and polite staff, tasty burger and fun ambience, the old furniture is a nice touch. I hope they can get some promo priced items."
"If you're like me, you've driven or walked past this place assuming it was a run of the mill diner and thought nothing more. I'm so glad I finally decided to look into Grandma J's because it's nothing of the sort.It's super cozy and full of mix and match furniture and table settings. It's BYOB and they'll bring you and awesome Bloody Mary mix for you to pour your own vodka (they know the way to my heart). The food is definitely stellar. Bomb brunch.It's 4/5 only because I think it's slightly overpriced, but mostly because while the service was attentive, we felt like we were VERY rushed. There didn't happen to be a wait that day and I realize it's a tiny breakfast spot, but we were really looking forward to unwinding and enjoying the experience. I know it stinks when people linger and tables extensively, but by the time we left (it was about 45 minutes) I almost felt like we got kicked out."
"We were in the area checking out the new 606 trail and discovered this restaurant at lunch time. The atmosphere is charming, plenty to look at while you wait for your freshly cooked meal. The menu has twists on brunch favorites. So instead of eggs benedict, it is green fried tomatoes benedict. Delicious! Coffee is good and strong, and plentiful. Great find. Service was good too."
"Yesterday morning was like many other Sundays, I was in serious need of brunch. Wanting to stay close to home we decided to try somewhere new and go to Grandma j's. We were sat at one of the cozy community tables and immediately served some tasty coffee. We ordered Virgin bloody Mary's and sent a friend out into the worldTo bring us back a bottle of titos. While it took a little work the bloody was completely worth it. To eat we ordered fried pickles, the works, and the bacon gravy and biscuits, everything was cooked perfectly and full of flavor! Our server who I'm pretty sure was the owner was as sweet as pie and the service was fantastic. I wish I could wake up and be served such great food while listening to the black angels every day!!"
"Best brunch place on north ave, west of western. Cute and clean place, friendly service. I have been a bit frustrated with the cash only policy, smallish portions, and running out of menu items. Happy this place is in the neighborhood so I like to spend my money here."
"A nicely decorated spot with delicious food, but... It received two stars from me for a number of reasons.Firstly, they were out of ingredients for every dish I asked about, including what I ordered. For a place as small as this one with as limited a menu as it has, this knocks out a significant percentage of what customers can order. It's an inconvenience, and makes ordering needlessly risky.Secondly, for the portions given, the prices are ridiculous. I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with chips. That was $10. The sandwich was on tiny bread slices, I'm talking maybe 3.5 to 4 inches square. Thirdly, service was a bit cool. Not the worst, but not the best.Fourthly, the hipster indie music sucks! Please do something about it. A profusion of whining twee voices doesn't aid digestion in any way.I would like to like this place, and again, the food IS delicious, but they need to check the menu and the prices. Don't be out of several basic ingredients; it looks bad. I won't be recommending this place to anyone, nor going out of my way to return, delicious food aside."
"So, I have this, well, obsession with Chicken and waffles. If a restaurant has them on the menu and they sound tasty, that will most likely be what I order. Without a doubt. Like I said, obsession. Needless to say, this restaurant has them and they are PHENOMENAL. Deep fried waffle batter, how can you go wrong????? The hot sauce is also homemade, makes the whole experience that much better.In addition to the crack daddy of all chicken and waffles, the restaurant is BYOB and sells a kick-ass mimosa tray which includes three juice drinks and fruit slices for you to put on the rim of your glasses if you're feeling fancy.ALSO, the service is great - the owner was our server and she was friendly, approachable and extremely funny.My only complaint is that they're cash only, which they tell you when you're being seated and it's clearly displayed so they do give fair warning. This is negligible considering how great an experience I had."
"Ok, food gets a 4.5 but the service was a bit rough for me. I met a friend for brunch on Sunday and he was waiting for me at the bar. I immediately loved the intimate setting of Grandma J's. Small tables and miss-matched chairs and plates but was a bit confused as to why it took so long to get our menus when we sat down at our table.There was 1 main server and a couple additional staff running and bussing. I saw the chef coming out to great everyone to make sure they were enjoying some of the seasonal and newer menu options, which was nice. I got the cremini and bacon omelet, and my friend got the lamb burger. The homemade sriracha was INSANE. I wish I could bottle that up and take it with me. The food was delicious and didn't disappoint.But we got the check (pay with cash as I tried to download the payment app they used and couldn't get a strong signal to finish the download) and it took a long time to pay. We had gotten there at 9:30am so it wasn't too busy. But by this time at 10:30am, people were coming in for seats.They don't do communal sitting. SO, if you're a 2-person party, you have to either sit at the bar or wait for a 2-top. The larger tables are meant for 4-6 people groups. However, there were a couple of 2-tops ready to pay and leave, which would have alleviated some of the congestion. My recommendation would be to flip the tables faster by taking payments quicker (which would mean you visit the table to see if they're ready to pay) so that others can sit. I would go back to try something else since the food was so good, and I would definitely try to get there early again so I'm not waiting."
"I agree with everything Anthony said and have the same complaints.The only saving grace of this place was one nice server, but she could've been more helpful.Learn to maximize your small space! And make community tables a thing! We waited forever for someone to seat us with other people at a table that stayed empty for twenty minutes. Why wasn't that done sooner? We weren't even greeted within five minutes.The food was just OK. I would not recommend this to place to anyone ever."
My wife and I absolutely love this place. The food is always good and the service is fantastic. The owner rocks! We too are a mixed minority couple.
"In the past 5 years I've lived in Chicago, I've never really had a favorite breakfast/brunch spot, that is until I discovered Grandma J's a few months back.  There's plenty of good/borderline great places to get breakfast/brunch in Chicago, but Grandma J's has the total package, at least for yours truly.First, and most importantly is the food, particularly the Fried Chicken & Waffle Fritters.  That's some pretty serious s*** right there.  The 3 incredibly large and delicious fritters would be enough to fill up most folks, and I'd rather have those than any other pastry imaginable (is it even technically a pastry?  anyway, I digress...).  But the main attraction is the fried chicken.  I am pretty sure that's the best fried chicken I've had in Chicago.  It's the real deal, mainly because it is just so incredibly juicy.  That's the key to great fried chicken if you ask me (juiciness) and Grandma J's has it in spades.  Fantastic flavor, it rivals my favorite fried chicken place in the US of A (Hard Knox in SF).  And, as an added bonus, they provide this country-gravy flavored dipping sauce for the side of chips they give you, which, being a big fan of chicken-fried steak, makes me very happy.  It's the trifecta of gluttony for me, and it's oh so GD delicious.  But it's not all about the fried chicken, as The Works (2 cage free poached eggs on top of potato hash with cheddar cheese marinated mushrooms , crispy kale, bacon and fried tomato in a bowl comes with toast,house made jam) is also quite delectable in it's own right.  It's the closet thing I've found to Eggs in a Tasty Nest which is an epic dish served by Pork Store Cafe in SF.   They also have many other items that sound perhaps equally delicious, like a Pork Belly Bennie, Duck Eggs and Ham, Steak and Eggs, Shrimp and Grits...you get it...this place does not F around.And to top it all off, this place has a cozy eclectic vibe to it that make it unique and quirky.  Old school random antiquish furniture/chairs/etc.  Pictures of classic beautiful women from generations passed.  Board games and toys for my daughter to enjoy...and it's got a counter (I don't like breakfast places that don't have a counter).  The staff suits the vibe of the place and they're all warm and accommodating without a trace of pretentiousness to boot.   Cool people.And it's BYOB.And they do occasional burlesque shows.So there you have it.For this guy right here, Grandma J's is the total package in every conceivable way and then some.  Pretty much perfect for yours truly."
"What a wonderfully eclectic restaurant with personal service and fantastic food! BYOB'd champagne and got the mimosa (oj) from the restaurant. The deviled eggs were out of this world- funny to say that about a food that is available at most parties I attend. I ordered The Works and it did not disappoint- poached eggs, crispy kale with potatoes. The coffee is good too, try it with their coconut cream, tastes novel! Glad this place opened west of California Ave., very few places in the area that serve such an awesome Brunch! Highly recommended :)"
"I am so happy with Grandma J's, it is everything a brunch spot should be! Close-by, cutely decorated, full of good vibes, nice music, friendly clientele and employees... and, most importantly, delicious eats. All with no wait on a Sunday morning-- it doesn't get any better than this! :) My husband and I ordered up a pair of morning sandwiches, tasty with fresh eggs not overcooked, crispy kale, and a garlicky spread. A little bacon on top, homemade chips on the side, YUM! Plus their homemade french host? Tastes like a funnel cake! :D Only better, I dare say.A true neighborhood gem. Thanks guys for being awesome!"
"A great place in the neighborhood, right across one of the prettiest parks in Chicago. Don't think it can be called a 'secret' anymore cuz the yelp reviews seem to have let the secret out! I'm happy for them and hope their business booms and can sustain long term!I went there before it got so popular so there was no wait for the table for two. Its cozy and feels like you're sitting at your grandma's house waiting for some food. The servers are sweet and very friendly. Food is fresh and yummy. I need to go back soon! Just know that its cash only before you go."
"I was really excited about eating here since they have Chicken (on the bone) and Waffles! They also have these delicious looking deviled eggs (I didn't get to try because they were out), and much more. There wasn't really a wait during a high-time of Sunday brunch (it was the 3rd place we tried), so we were pretty pumped. Unfortunately, the place was understaffed along with half their menu being unavailable. The place is very warm, friendly, and everyone was super hospitable for the fact that they were getting their asses handed to them. I was a little disappointed that my Chicken & Waffles didn't have gravy since it pretty much makes the dish (they were out of biscuits & gravy, and by that I was supposed to assess that my meal would not include that). Also, the bacon was turrible (Charles Barkley Turrible). I'm pretty sure it was made out of paint chips! I'd go back, but I wouldn't eat the bacon!"
"Stumbled into this place following a very lazy Saturday morning (I'd say around 1130am).  Was taken in by the fun atmosphere and excellent, and not too loud, music in rotation.  We were offered a seat by the window or at the bar - it being November, we chose the bar.  The food was great.  The service, very very good."
"I remember coming here over a year ago and had a really delightful, simple, yet fresh breakfast, just like how a meal should be, friends/family gathering around a table over mom's (or grandma's :) ) kitchen enjoying a laid-back weekend morning...Coming back again, and was surprised how busy it got...doh...why would i be surprised after all?!We got seated at the ""bar"", and loved seeing the kitchen in action.The french toast stick was easily the best i had....no fancy toppings, just crunchy outside, and moist inside, drizzle with some powdered sugar....and i don't usually like french toast nor deep fried bread.....the Brussels sprout salad was sooo good that i wanted to remake this for dinner! My bf overruled my usual order of dressing on the side, and i was sooo glad he did. Places usually drench salad in dressing, but grandma seems to know what ""she's"" doing...the little drizzles of the lemon vinaigrette enhanced the flavour so much that i almost didn't want to share the salad :PThe croque madame was soo different from the usual...instead of deli ham, they use the real stuff. Instead of the greasy cheesy topped bread, this is more like an open-face sandwiches with a bit of melted cheese and the sauce, topped with the moist ham and pouched egg...this thing packed with tons of flavour....why does grandma live so far away :)"
"Great brunch in walking distance of home! I've been here with my guy, my parents, and various groups of friends. Fun ambiance, the food is delicious and the service is laid-back, easy. Since ingredients are sourced local, it is possible they may run out of something. I would describe the dining experience like this - good, original fare and relaxed atmosphere for the low-maintenance diner."
"This is a cute place.  It's got cute decor, it's got cute furniture, it's got cute additions, it's got cute artwork, it's got cute ceiling tiles and it's got a cute washroom as well.  The owner is cute, she's got a cute menu and she's pretty cute to chat with as well.  I like the randomness of their serve ware and furniture, it's like having a meal at Granny's.  I've driven through the heartland and found places like this, places that seemed like it was food served in your country Grandmother's kitchen.Except this granny is not serving up the foods attained at the local (GMO) supermarket.  Not all of it.  She tries to offer locally sourced or grown vegetables, organic meats, decent coffee and an alternative for coffee being Almond milk.  I would have liked to see a milk variety like Organic, unpasteurized, grass fed, etc.  This is one condiment often skipped over by restaurants of this caliber.  I stopped in with good company to check out their Sunday Brunch.  Parking was readily available and free on the street.  We three dined on the following; Brunch burger, Eggs Benedict and The 1552.  See online menu for details.  The plate was filled and most of us could not finish it.  My eggs Benny was perfect, poached but still runny, the hash was good and complimented with ketchup & hot sauce; how I usually desire it.  (On a side note: celery pieces in the hash were too honking big).  For starters we shared the fried pickles and French toast sticks.  View great photos on Yelp or most any other social media.  Between the two the French toast were my favorite.  Not entirely sweet like most French toast would be, the batter was almost sour but with powdered sugar and a light amount of syrup it was just right.  The brunchin' took time from when we sat to the time we finished.  If in a rush, I wouldn't suggest them as an option.  From first ordering to refills or receiving, the time taken were carefree and that can be a disappointing factor for some.Next visit: Chicken and waffles or their meatloaf sammy."
"Although quite tempted to give it one star to keep everyone away, like Cathy J., I just can't. It's very very good and a fun and cool place. The BYOB mimosa bar is tasty and the bloody mary mix is great as well. Fried pickles were good. Chicken and Waffle fritters were only meh. The chicken was great, but I the waffle fritters were more like funnel cake sticks. The French toast sticks were also amazing. Yum. It's tiny, so I'd stick with four people in your party to enjoy it properly. Actually, please don't go there, so that I can continue to enjoy it without waiting in line. :-)"
I've been here several times and never had a problem with the food or staff. best to come on weekday or early on weekend.  save yourself the parking hunt and take the North ave bus to kedzie stop and your there.  Have a nice stroll in the park after to burn the calories...because you will get your share...especially if you take advantage the sides and byob
"Love this place! Came for the first time and was blown away by the food. The decor is cozy and comfortable. Mismatched chairs, trinkets and lighting add to the effect of feeling as though you were at grandma's house. There are a ton of great selections of the menu. I recommend the chicken and waffle fritters...delicious! It is a healthy offering of fresh homemade fried chicken and handmade waffle fritters. Their own house hot sauce adds the perfect spice to this sweet and savory dish. Additionally the steak and eggs is exceptional! A hearty and cooked to perfection steak with delicious eggs accompanying it and shoe string potatoes atop make for a wonderful brunch meal. I will be coming back. The wait for the food was totally worth it. Good things are worth waiting for....believe me."
"WHY ONE STAR?!?!? Truth is, Gradma J's deserves a constellation of its own! BUT I hesitate to give it the FIVE (plus, plus, plus) STARS it deserves... Let's put it this way: would you ever draw a map to your favorite ""secret spot""? Thought so!Food is AMAZING and so is Layla, the wonderful owner who went out of her way to accommodate our big group during one their busiest hours. Our table sampled 9 dishes and everything was a HIT! Seriously, stay away from this place if you know what's best for...ME."
"I live in the neighborhood, I've been here about a dozen times.  I always love everything about the staff and the food.  They make everything fresh to order, so you will wait a few, but it will be worth it.  I love this place and it's worth waiting for.Also, PLEASE Don't ever take the lemon & herb biscuits with lobster bisque off the menu.   It may be the best thing I've ever had in Chicago.  Seriously."
"Big cities always seem to have a profusion of these awesome little gems. Lucky Humboldt Park.Must knows: * cash only* hella friendly staff* solid yummy/ thumbs up on taste* like the limited number of selections* the armory across the street is a stunner to behold The iced tea was pretty sucky first time around, but they were so accommodating, they made another pitcher. It still wasn't great tea, but A for effort. I'd go back."
"Really lovely and delicious breakfast/brunch spot. Super thrilled to make this a regular treat.The vibe is exactly as the name suggests- vintage touches, mix-matched chairs, beautiful old family photographs, and a very relaxed, casual feel. But the food is the real reason to visit. I had ""the works"" which is the perfect combo of flavors including roasted kale, potatoes, cheddar, over-easy eggs, bacon, and fried tomatoes. The service was charming too, and no fuss was made that it was already 2:45 when we waltzed in, even though they close at 3pm.  Can't wait to stroll through Humboldt Park and stop in again."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE! Bacon fat and pepper biscuits need I say more? Great atmosphere, they always play good music and so far all the food I've tried has been delicious. Try the chicken and waffles or the biscuits and gravy."
This place was so good for breakfast that my friends & I returned 2 days later for breakfast round 2!! Highly recommend the kale/sweet potato omelet...sooo yummy & guilt-free!!
"New favorite breakfast spot!!!! It's a mile down the road from us. How did I not hear about this place sooner? The decor is so comforting which pairs perfectly with their menu. I went with a couple of friends who, like me, explore new menus like a couple of starving wolves.We ordered many items and was able to try them all. The biscuits and gravy were all I've always wanted! Spicy gravy? Amazing! The chorizo omelette was delicious. My favorite part of that dish was the pickled radish. The works was tastey. I had the braised short ribs. Even the kale side salad was mouth watering. Last but not least, we tried the French toast sticks. It was the perfect sweet, crunchy, buttery ending to our feast. Will definitely be back very very soon!"
"The perfect cozy little reminder of what breakfast/brunch could be like if your grammy lived down the street and didn't look down her nose at you for bringing a bottle of vodka at 10am.  Obviously, you have to try their chicken and waffles but THERE'S SO MUCH MORE!!  They'll pour you a pitcher of mix, if you ask nicely, for you to combine with your BYOB of choice to make mimosas, bloody's etc.  AND, they have cute little bags of candy.  Belly up, y'all..."
I enjoyed the atmosphere the service was nice and friendly..it's just the food wasn't great. My friend ordered this works bowl it tasted like cleanser. They took it off the bill but the off putting flavor stayed with me for over two hours. My food was fine a bit over sauced but not bad.....I don't know if I will go back.
"Love this place and all of its quirks and yuminess!   Simple, healthy and delicious - what a great addition to that corner!  We've missed going to Treat and although this doesn't replace it, the simplicity and goodness of the dishes will keep us coming back!My hubby and I chose this place the morning before he was leaving for a work trip to Asia, this really hit the spot as a taste of Americana for him to think about throughout his trip :)  We ordered the Benedict and the sandwich, both with the hash.  Will be nice to try something different next time, but I have a feeling that we will stick with our original choices, since they were so good!See you soon, grandma J's!"
I have been frequenting Grandma Js for a while .I have always ordered something different and enjoyed every bite of every  meal .The staff is friendly and attentive . I would recommend this place to every one but it would ruin the secret awesome spot that I like to get breakfast at .Also they are always playing good diverse music .
"oh goooood! heaven in our mouths!  for me, my husband and  toddler kids! food, bottomless coffee, organic ketchup, jar glasses, frames, chairs different utensils, games and crayons and coloring books! but food .... every bite was amazing! all zusamen highly recommended home feeling :)!"
I absolutely love this place! It literally feels like I'm eating at my Gram's. Decor is spot on. Food is incredible! I'm gluten intolerant but I suffer to eat the breakfast sandwich. Oh man. Delicious everything! The aeoli bread is magical and the coffee is perfect. Nicest people around working there. I will continue to eat here. No doubt.
"Came on a Wed for brunch. It was pretty dead, which was awesome as we had a 1.5 week old that we brought out with us. The decor is homey, as soon as you walk in you are definitely transported into somewhere other than Humboldt Park. It kinda feels like when you're driving out into the country to go apple picking or something and you stop off at a place on the side of the road? Something like that. Anyway, we got coffee, which was good. As a precursor to brunch a few pieces of pineapple and honeydew were left on the table. We ordered the chicken and waffles, the duck 3-ways, and the pork belly benedict.  All good. They ran out of kale, which was fine. All were really hearty dishes, but the duck and pork belly hashes were very similar?  They were proteins set upon potatoes and some sorta bread, with sauce covering it. I thought the duck was better. Anyway the fried chicken was deliciously yum. 3 pieces of chicken with the bone, 2 wings and a breast. Best part of the entire meal, hands down.The ""waffle"" is so misleading- they should change it to say chicken and funnel cake. Seriously. The funnel cake was tasty, it was crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside. But it was greasy. That in itself I think was more filling than the chicken. These folks should expand their fried chicken options, i.e. not just sell it in single entree form. I'm talkin' sell them by the bucketful, seriously!! They would make a killing!!Anyway, it's good here. I'd definitely come back!"
"Definitely can't wait to go back and try something else from the menu. I had the chicken and waffles. The chicken was cooked perfect with a tasty breading covering it. The waffles.. WERE AMAZING. Like fried dough, all it was missing was Ice cream. The coffee was well priced and strong. The place is small but that shouldn't stop you from enjoying yourself.  Also music was on point."
"My favorite meal of the day is brunch.....and Grandma J's nails it!!!I visited Saturday 1.5.14 around 2pm (they close at 3pm) with one other person and we were seated promptly.  The place is small so I could see there being a wait during peak brunch hours.  Friendly service from the moment we walked in and all throughout our visit.My friend and I both thoroughly enjoyed the food and vowed to return soon with more friends and spread the word.  It's BYOB too which is a huge plus in my book.   We ordered the Mimosa tray for our peach champagne.  It consists of OJ, Grapefruit Juice,  and a homemade mixture they have that i can't remember the ingredients to.  They have a Bloody Mary tray if that's your thing."
"breakfastrules.blogspot.…In the history of breakfast blogs, those were the best pancakes we've come across. The eggs were good. The coffee was OK. The bacon was perfect. Dr. Nick enjoyed his non-steroidal chicken but would have preferred regular waffles instead of the fritters. He did, however, wholeheartedly approve of the hot sauce. Brent thought the biscuits and gravy was good. Wizard Bear Rick finished everything. And I ate everything plus more.If things didn't seem so odd, it might have even got a higher rating. Nonetheless, The Organization That Eats & Then Rates Breakfasts highly recommends Grandma J's Local Kitchen and gives it four very, very surprised Brent faces."
"Although the place is kind of small, it's been my experience that it'll either be full of people or kind of empty depending on the morning.Super delicious, fattening food. You'll find lots of reasonably priced, breakfast staples here. Not a fan of their quirky decor but no big deal.Incredibly nice staff. Check it out, it's freakin BYOB."
"Couldn't have been more surprised. I thought I walked into someone's living room. It was awkward, as we aren't from the neighborhood or anything, but the food was well worth it. We were very pleased. Walk in, sit down, trust the help reviews and give this place a shot. The food was great"
"So happy to have a brunch spot in the neighborhood! Love the staff, the menu, and the atmosphere. One suggestion - I think they can do much better with the curb appeal! How it looks from the outside doesn't match the comfort and great food inside. Bright curtains and removing some clutter could make a world of difference."
"Brunch here is like eating at a bed and breakfast with the best comfort food and an atmosphere you want to wear pj's in!  I loved this place and I loved their food!  YES, maybe I went at a good time (early enough on a Sunday where there was no wait or a rush).     YES, maybe I ordered the right thing (some deviled eggs with bacon and a take on a Mexican dish).  YES, maybe it doesn't bother me that it's cash only since it's a locally owned restaurant.  YES, maybe the hot chocolate was freshly made and delicious.  YES, maybe I bought two silk screen tanktops which I oggled as I ate.  YES, maybe I wish I was there right now.For a brunch place, the food is different enough to hold it's own, yet comfort enough to make you feel at home.  This will be my 2nd favorite brunch place in the city.  I guess now I'll have to go for some home cooked dinner."
"Tiny place, nowhere to wait for a table and draconian seating practices (you have two people and a 3-top is open?  Too damn bad, you can't have it, even if there are no groups of 3 waiting).  The staff was anything but welcoming.  I am only giving 2 stars since the food looked ok, but we didn't want to deal with the attitude so we went elsewhere.  I may try it on a weekday but there are plenty of other places to go."
Layla and her restaurant are the bomb.  The works and breakfast sandwich are amazing! Go eat here already (:
It was ok I was disappointed at the burger it looks so good on pic but it's lamb I didn't order it I was looking forward to eating a burger so that said we just ordered coffee n appetizers so we wouldn't just walk out but holy sht it was pricy $40 for 4 appetizers wow
"Had a great time here this morning. Got greeted and seated right away, I know that won't happen every time though! Food was very tasty, service was friendly and quick, decorated well mismatched plates and furniture. They were playing the first Ninja Turtles movie on a little tv in the corner and playing Zeppelin and War Pigs. Won't forget eating here. Thanks Grandma J!"
"absolutely LOVE their deviled eggs.  A MUST when you go here.They are surprisingly ""gourmet"" and make everything to order.  I love that idea....but when you have a toddler to entertain while you're waiting for food, it's not so great.  Still, that is not their fault.The coffee was okay and the rest of the breakfast we ordered was good, but just didn't blow us away.  All in all, a good place for an intimate bfast with friends (without kids).  :)"
"Thanks, Yelpers, for another great rec! We loved Grandma J's-great ambience, wonderful service and amazing food. Waffle fritters are unbelieveable. Chicken and  bacon were delicious. Be sure to ask for the hot sauce, it adds a nice flavor to just about everything."
"This place is a hidden gem - much like the gigantic park across the street from here! I had never heard of this place before but a friend of mine had found it on Yelp. The decor was really interesting. Lots of eclectic knick knacks, pictures of grandmas, and random artwork that somehow all came together as if you were in someone's attic.If you love brunch, then this is the place to be. They had all the classic staples such as eggs benedict, eggs, toast, and so on. There were a lot of options that included kale. The menu says no substitutes but that they honor vegetarians and vegans. Looking at the ingredients didn't seem like it was too vegetarian or vegan friendly though. Luckily for me I'll eat anything, but just something to keep in mind if you are vegetarian or vegan. I had the works which include 2 poached eggs, potato hash, cheddar, crispy kale, and a fried tomato. This was amaaazing. It's hard to find a place that makes breakfast/brunch food unique, and this place did it!Service is great, and they will accept credit cards as long as you use the app Level Up. I've never used it before, but it was simple enough to download in the store."
"I wanted to love this place but it was just okay.  I wasn't blown away like other reviewers.  While we won't return, our food was good.  It didn't blow us away and less than an hour later, we completely forgot about breakfast.  In addition to ordering the works and the morning sandwich, we ordered the French ""sticks"" -- but they were SUPER DUPER hard.  My husband let his sit in the syrup for a little to try to soften it.  Sigh."
"Sweet lord. This place. We met a large group here for lunch, stopping at the liquor store for cash and booze. The owner passed out a French toast basket for us while we waited. The food and the ambience were perfectly homey and delicious. We got the fried pickles, bacon devised eggs (!), fried chicken and waffle fritters, and brunch burger. All were perfectly prepared. The bloody marys were flat out ridiculous. Don't go if you're in a hurry, but if you're ready to pass a lovely time with friends and amazing food, I've got good news for you."
"Words cannot express how much I love Grandma J's. I moved around the corner from this restaurant in February. I remember when there was a coming soon sign on the door and I wondered if this place would ever be finished. Now that it's open, it is my favorite place to be in the neighborhood. Layla is welcoming and beautiful just like her restaurant is. You feel like you are at home as soon as you walk in. You can have a conversation with everyone on staff that day. You can give your compliments directly to the chef.I have eaten there multiple times and everything I have eaten there is muy delicioso. I have had the bacon topped meatloaf with mashed potatoes. I have also had their breakfast sandwich. Everything is organic and freshly made on the spot. It is made with love and care. You can taste it in the food. I like the fact that if I only have $1.50 in my pocket, I can go into Grandma J's and buy a cup of coffee or tea and sit for hours and talk to everyone that comes in the door. That's how comfortable this place is. They have board games, they have crayons and paper for the kids. It is BYOB so if mommy needs her wine, she can bring it lol. I hope to never move too far away from Grandma J's because if I did, I would have to travel to get to it."
"Weak flavorless coffee (both regular and Swedish)CASH ONLYFriendly attentive service and very helpful.The husband had the chicken salad and said it was OK, nothing special.I had the mushroom toast.  The mushrooms were delicious.  The multiple-grain bread from Roser's was OK.  The egg white was perfectly scrambled.  The poached egg was overlooked.  The red pepper and onions in the potatoes were OK.  The potatoes were under seasoned and bland.The decor is fun and eclectic.Street parking was easy."
"Absolutely, positively, delicious! I loved the homey, casual feel. It literally felt like I was dining in a hip, awesome grandma's place. The servers were really nice and made us feel very welcome, especially with our 2 kiddos. They were in the process of changing the menu so I just gave them vague direction and they ran with it. The result was delectable! A grassfed, organic burger patty, lemony kale greens and some down-home macaroni salad, all on one plate. Everything went together great and I could taste the REALness of the ingredients. Nothing overly fancy, just REAL, delicious, local food. Next time I am visiting Chicagoland, I will happily and excitedly go back!"
"Finally got to check out Grandma J's for brunch with a pal. Sitting on the couch, sipping our coffees, and catching up, it felt like we were in our grandmas' living rooms. We arrived first thing, so our service was excellent and so was the food. I enjoyed all the favors and textures comprising ""The Works"" and will definitely be back for some more. Looking forward to spring, when I can walk over from Logan Square! Yum!"
"I have to say, I'm really confused about the 4.5 star rating here. I was super excited to try this place. The interior has that ""grandma's home"" vibe and you can sit at the bar that looks into an open kitchen, which I think is always fun. That's where the positive stuff ends.There was only one other table, plus a group of people who were clearly friends of the owner/chef playing cards but weren't eating. It took at least 20 minutes for the lady to take our order and another 30-35 minutes to get our meal. The homemade potatoes were almost raw which was weird because they were cut into small cubes. My food was decent but nothing I would return for. It took another 20 minutes to get a box and our check. For a place to have ONE other two top take almost an hour and half is ridiculous. It was as if we didn't matter to the server. I'm so disappointed and really confused as to how this place has such high reviews."
"I truly wanted to like this place.  Another ""great"" breakfast place in the 'hood would have been greatly appreciated.  To get to the point quickly, there was only one other occupied table in the place when I went and yet the service was unbelievably slow, bizarrely slow.  Also, the potatoes that I had with my meal were still almost raw.  If things are going to take forever, at least make sure the execution is on point, it wasn't.4.5 stars for this place makes no sense, there are too many other excellent options in this city and even in this neighborhood."
"Great staff and good food.  Excellent music.  Pictures of grandmas on the wall.  Really nice.There was a snafu with my order the pancake batter the first time I was here and the cook made it a point of honor not only to take it off the bill (without our asking), but to buy me an order of pancakes himself the next time I was there (again not at my request). Best customer service ever.Food takes a bit tiger to you, but it's homemade, so what do you want?Fantastic.  I will definitely be back again."
"Doesn't get better than this place for BYOB brunch made with love and care from a team dedicated to scrumptious brunch eats. Grandma J's daughter is a doll! She's made a comfortable and lovely restaurant in honor of her Mom and it shows how much she loves the place. I've been a few times and the broccoli special I had on the first visit had me sold on going back again and I've been on a roll from there. Easy parking, BYOB, atmosphere that feels like you are at your parents kitchen table (the good parts you remember) and super tasty food make this a winner!!"
"I love finding new Brunch places, and Grandma J's looks like it's here to stay!The pros:Friendly serviceExcellent foodReasonably pricedThe cons:Small restaurant/seating areaThe exterior does NOT reflect what's inside. Pretty misleading imhoI'm also glad that I took a leap for the chicken and waffles, because it's probably my new favorite breakfast item around down right next to Flying Saucer's Eggs Benedict."
"A date took me here, and even though we're over, my relationship with Grandma J's is only just beginning. I loved everything about it: the homey feel, the delightful staff, quick service, and of course the food. He ordered the chicken and waffle fritters, a fun twist with a delicious batter. And my Monte Cristo was one of the best breakfast items I've ever put in my mouth. Guh. Looking over the menu is making me drool all over again. I'll be back soon, Grandma!"
This place is delicious and definitely worth the money to go out for brunch!!
"Great food, super cute ambiance, and friendly staff. Perfect if you're into breakfast/comfort food and ethical eating."
"Grandma J's is my favorite favorite favorite! Amazing food, totally affordable, great ambiance, board games (!), and the friendliest service EVER.Quick anecdote: A couple weeks ago I went w/my wife for a late dinner and they were starting to close up early due to a lack of customers. They'd already closed the metal gate and were mopping up, but we knocked on the window and they reopened JUST for US. And they were totally happy to do it! At any other restaurant, being the only customers might have been awkward, but they were warm and inviting, treating us like family, and even gave us a complementary dessert! Talk about above and beyond. Seriously.I highly encourage everyone to go, and experience the awesomeness of Grandma J's. Brunch always draws a good crowd, but I get worried when I walk by sometimes in the evening and see it totally empty, because if they went away it would be a HUGE loss to the neighborhood. Support Grandma J's - you won't regret it! Woo!"
"I wanted to give this place a better review, so badly. I love that there is a local place that serves breakfast past California Ave. My mom and I came here on a Sunday morning just 6 minutes after they had opened. There were only two people tending to the tables, which is fine as there are only 6 tables in the whole place. The decor and atmosphere are super cozy and intimate (just a nice way of saying small). I love that there are (what I assume to be) family photos on the walls and that the silverware and dishes are mismatched. However, the service and wait time left a lot to be desired here. We waited quite a while to get menus and order our food. By the time we had received our food we had been in Grandma J's for 45 minutes. I assume the owner was one of the people tending to the tables. About 20 minutes after my mom and I had arrived, a few people the owner knew walked in the door. They were immediately tended to and had ordered and had food in front of them 10 minutes after sitting...while my mom and I still waited for our food. Family and friends are likely to be repeat customers even if they aren't immediately tended to. It is probably more important to get people from the local community to be repeat customers. This is not the way to do that, though. In total we were there for an hour from the time we walked in the door until we left.We shared The Works and the French Toast Sticks. Despite the long wait time, the French Toast Sticks are what give this a 2 star rating. They were so good! I love that Grandma J's works with local businesses and uses organic items, as well. The food tasted fresh...it just would have been much better if we hadn't had to scarf it all down in 10 minutes to make sure my mom got to the train on time. Just a note, it is cash only here. I would be willing to give this place another change when I have more free time for the day."
"the duck 3 ways is everything (not to be confused with, ""3 ways are everything"")."
"Great service, great food, great atmosphere! I will definitely go back."
"I love breakfast and this place is one of the best. Everything was delicious, but make sure you order the pancakes. Probably the best I have ever had."
"Grandma J's always leaves me with a happy feeling when I leave, like just at my own grandma's house. I love the charming decorations, from the mismatched coffee mugs on each table to the ancient cookbooks on the book shelves. The owner is lovely, always approaching my table with friendly conversation and good suggestions.Vegetarians, you're covered here. Deep-fried pickles, roasted kale, and caprese-style eggs benedict with tomatoes and balsamic are just a few options during brunch. Their bacon is crisp and hearty, and all their breakfast patters are filling without leaving you feeling like you just betrayed your stomach. They have dinner now, I think Thursdays-Sundays. I haven't gotten a chance to try it yet, but walking past after work sometimes, I look in and wish I was inside; low lighting, BYOB wine bottles, people looking like they're having a great time. I'm so glad this is in my neighborhood!I've eaten there probably five or six times now, and each time it's clear Grandma J's is hitting its stride more and more. The first few times the food was slow coming out and there were a few other hiccups, but the more I've been there the more and more excellent they have become, with high-quality food and lovely ambiance to match. I only wish they opened even earlier so I could get some of their delicious coffee (almond milk is an option!) on my way to work!"
Hi---I can't write a poem like the last review but this place is magnificent.  I brought my 2 friends here who are my discerning foodie breakfast buddies.  We must have tried 10-15 places the past year.   This one is hands down the favorite.The Kedzie is magnificent.  Jasmine cheddar rice cakes alone deserve 5 stars!  I had the breakfast sandwich which was also delicious.We are already planning our next visit here.  My friends also want to bring family members since they loved it so much.  Neighborhood is a bit sketchy but we took nice spring walk through Humboldt Park across the street after our meal.  Come here and enjoy!
"The one star is for the food that was decent (and that I can't give zero). The service was completely abysmal, and I will most definitely never return to this place. We sat at our table for over 20 minutes and were completely ignored. No water, no glasses so we could make our mimosas, nothing. This place has 6 tables and seemed to have 2 servers, but one would disappear for long periods of time. Even as our ""server"" walked past us multiple times, I'm not sure why a quick, ""So sorry, I'll be right with you,"" couldn't be said.There are so many great brunch places in the city with servers that actually know how to do their job, so I will be patronizing any one of those in the future, as should you.Based on the other reviews I'm seeing, it seems like it might have been an off day, but the service was just so terrible that I had to comment on it. Hopefully you won't have the same experience I did. Unless you decide you want to spend 2 hours at brunch, where an hour of it involves waiting to be acknowledged by your server at various points."
"Everyone needs a go-to place for breakfast food.  Grandma J's is mine!! - but I'm willing to share, even if it means I have to wait for a seat.I love, love, love ""The Works.""  They'll make it gluten-free. (no bread on the side, no fried tomato on top)  Layla, why even bother giving me a menu anymore?  You know what I'm having.Great music, sweet ambiance,  70's kung fu movies on the little TV in the corner sometimes prompts the boyfriend and I to make up lines to go with them.  Please don't change a thing - stick to the ""no-decaf"" rules and for the love of all that is good in this world, keep making the bloody mary mix.  Did I mention that I love ""The Works""?"
