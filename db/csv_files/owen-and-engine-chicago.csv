Owen & Engine
"From the moment I walked into Owen & Engine, I knew i was in for a treat.  A couple of patrons were walking out as my party and I were walking in.  They  had a smile on their face and greeted us with a warm hello.  I thought to myself, ""well, someone just had a great time"".    My party and I walked up to the bar, where again, we were greeted with a genuine, warm greeting by the bartender.  All three of us asked for beer suggestions.  The bartender gave us brilliant recommendations.  I had a delightful stout that was just delicious.  We didn't eat a main, but did have spicy peanuts that were sweet but with a definite and much enjoyed kick.The staff are (with good reason) very proud of this pub and wanted to show us the upstairs before we left.  I'm so glad they did.  I really felt I was back in London.  The attention to detail from the wallpaper to the books on the shelf is meticulously thoughtful.   Both floors have the atmosphere of a beautifully maintained British pub.I cannot wait to bring some different friends to this place again."
"Everybody in the party was punctual to our 8:30pm Saturday reservation with the exception to O&E. We had to inconveniently wait in the bar area until our table was ready at 9:30pm.It was an unusually late hour for dinner so most of us were starving. We immediately attacked the menu and fired away with our appetizers and entrees upon seating.  But little did we know,  it would take them another 45 minutes to deliver the items. To start off,  we had the cheese board and cornish pasty. One of each was divided among nine of us. Not exactly an easy and satisfying effort,  but it gave everybody a bite.  I highly recommend the pasty as I think it's one of the best in town. Within the warm, flakey and crusty shell held an abundant amount of shredded pork.  Pair each bite with the piccalili, chutnry, and arugula, and you'll have yourself a delicacy. As for entrees,  I had a try of the wild boar chop and haddock fish and chips.  The chop is an ugly duckling by picture, but taste-wise is well worth your attention. It's finished in a mango soy glaze and accompanied with stir-fried farro, charred carrots, and crispy duck egg.  I would advise you to break the egg and let the yolk run across the plate.  Sounds like a mess but it certainly gave the dish an extra level of goodness. There was only one slab of chop on the plate and the meat was slightly tough. The fish and chips came with two dipping sauces,  malt vinegar mayonnaise and sauce gribiche. The latter is a mayonnaise-style cold egg sauce which I really enjoyed.  The fish was well fried in beer batter and the meat was fresh, soft,  and smooth. The fries were thin cut and standard. Also,  our server was quite a charmer. He knew we were celebrating our friend's big 30, so he kindly and generously gave the birthday boy a dessert on the house. The cookies and milk were selected.  Do not be deceived by its simple name. The chocolate cookies were freshly baked and intensely rich. If I wasn't full from dinner, I would've happily gorged one piece. The milk should not be forgotten.  With sea salt,  cinnamon, chocolate, and drambuie, this was not your typical breakfast drink. All in all, food and service excellent. But, with the lengthy delay in dinner, the plans for the rest of the evening were thrown off track. If you are coming into dinner without other obligations, then O&E would be the good, extensive affair to have. Otherwise, plan accordingly and leave yourself with a four hour window to be safe."
"I'm really torn between 3 and 4 stars for O&E. It's not the city's best burger IMO. The parking in the area is pretty awful and it's not very big so without a reservation be prepared to wait. There are a few first come first served places though.They have a sizeable beer and drink list and in Brit style they have some Pimm's options too. The menu isn't that big, but not too small but you will find that several items change frequently, but the burger will always be there. The burger is definitely big and juicy, but I find it a bit too salty. I had the pasty once and it was kinda blah.Last weekend, I got the boar chop that was fantastic. Very yummy! Even though it was a Sunday it was still jammed pack in the afternoon. There is a small patio upstairs with a few tables. I like O&E, but with the location and the crowd it's sometimes a bit more work than I would like."
"Some discerning folks recommended this place as a candidate for the best burger in Chicago.  They obviously take great pride in their work here, and my burger was perfectly tasty, but ""best burger in Chicago"" is a tough category, and this place just doesn't make the cut.  It's not even in the top five.  Not that there is anything wrong with the meat, carmelized onion, homemade roll combination, but there's simply a whole echelon of texture, salt, and acid that this burger failed to achieve.  (French fries with malt vinegar aioli were also fine, but again not superlative; the aioli wasn't that malty, and the fries were good but ordinary.)It's got a nice vibe, and this stretch of Western desperately needs a nice place to eat, so I'm glad that Owen & Engine exists and I might come back the next time I see a movie next door.  (Service was friendly and helpful but extraordinarily slow.)  But for a burger pilgrimage, you can do better."
"I'm 'bout this life. Drinking beer with insanely rich food at 11am on a Saturday? Yep, I'm 'bout that. I went to Owen & Engine at long last and the first thing i noticed was how much I loved their draft list. The first step to winning Sarah over is feeding her some good liquid so Owen & Engine was well on their way. Our waitress was very nice, not overly invasive and when I ordered my meal she told me the dish was delish so that peaked my interest. She was totally right. I had the Seasonal Mushroom on Focaccia with mornay, 5 hour egg, fried pickled mushrooms (plus tons of other mushrooms), truffle oil for 14 bucks...or as the Brits would say quid. This was just loaded with fungi goodness and was a pretty large dish. I was able to save half to have for dinner that night (thank you pints o beer for filling my tummy). Best scotch egg ever. Done perfectly. Tasted perfect. I could eat 999,999 of them. I found the prices to be high but not overly offensive.I need to try their brunch now! And more beers. Yesssss."
"I'm a fan of Owen and Engine! The bite of a burger I stole from my friend was GREAT, the beef hash I ordered for myself was good (I wished I'd ordered a burger, they're fantastic), the bloody mary was yummy. We reserved one of the bigger tables for a birthday lunch on a Saturday. It was a great time, a very unpretentious, down-to-earth place to grab some food and drinks. Our server was a stand-up comedian who talked about performing for the Chicago comedy scene. It's the kind of place you could walk in with flannels and jeans if you wanted, cocktail attire if you wanted, people don't really mind either way."
"I planned a small reunion for a group of eight people at Owen and Engine (we all studied abroad in London at the same time in college). I chose this gastropub because it's British and well-reviewed. Yelp definitely didn't lead us astray on this one! They were very understanding and accommodating considering our whole group didn't arrive at the same time. We were seated as we arrived and we ordered drinks as we decided on what to get. They brought out the wrong drink for my boyfriend, but let him keep it for free, so I enjoyed sipping on that throughout the meal (it was a dark stout). I hadn't eaten for a while so I was hungry! I usually don't order starters, but this time I decided to go for the warm pretzel with Welsh rarebit. It was so good! I honesty would return to O&E for the pretzel alone. The serving size was pretty big, so I had no problem sharing with friends. For my entree, I enjoyed the paneer. It was light and I enjoyed it, but I thought it was a bit lacking in flavor. I definitely enjoyed that this option was on the menu because there's so much great indian food in London! I would definitely return and I wholly recommend this place; I just may have not ordered the right thing (I was envious of my friend's fish and chips)."
"There are not too many places I have gone where A.Was a no brainer for a 5 star review and B. I have wanted to try EVERYTHING on the menu. Beer list is great-mix of local/nonlocal brews Food: Organized on menu from small plates to large which is helpful when ordering. We tried the softshell crab, bangers and mash, and fish and chips. Wish I could have had the room for 10 more dishes. All three were excellent. The softshell crab was perfectly done and the potato salad and vegetable garnishes were excellent. I would/am going to to come back here very soon and if you can sit on the patio upstairs, its a nice/small seating area that will maximize the whole experience."
"Owen & Engine basically had me at hello.  We opted for this spot as it was on the way to our concert venue (United Center) and had really good reviews on Yelp.  I am SO happy we stopped.  From the moment we entered, I whispered to the hubs - ""I think they've gotten the pub thing right""...and they totally did not disappoint.We were seated upstairs near a large fireplace and really cool massive wood bar.  The vibe in this place is really hard to describe, but it was so chill that I wanted to stay and sit on the couch by the fireplace for a long, long time.  Anyway ...The food.  OMG, the food.  We started with the Mustard Glazed Pretzel...delish.  Never mind that it came with a side of beer cheese that I wanted to pick up and just drink.   For dinner we opted for the Fish & Chips and a burger with chips (fries).  A burger?  At an English Pub?  YES.  An amazing burger.  Cooked to perfection and SO good.  Fish had the perfect batter and the fries were not greasy at all.  Happy tummies all around.Our server was super cool and tolerant of us and our food stories and my husband's stories about living in England twice...blah blah blah.  Bless him.  He also had THE PERFECT beer suggestions for us.  Seriously on point.We will return to try the chicken next time as I hear it is where it's at.  If it is anything like our meal we had at this visit, I can't wait."
"Wow - brunch is a must at this British-inspired gastropub where eager eaters will find everything from Indian curry to corned beef hash. There are a number of small plates to choose from, as well, such as cinnamon rolls and crumpets, as well as your traditional Scotch egg, etc.A lovely and strong selection of beers are on tap, including real English ales and stouts. If you're more of a bloody slash mimosa person, those are avail as well.The decor was warm and inviting - plus there's an upstairs! I'd have given them 5 stars but service was a little slow. Pleasant, but slow, and very hard to hear our server. However, I wouldn't let that deter a visit back to this gem."
"Ranked #5 best burger in Chicago on Thrillist! Came here on a Tuesday for the $16 Burger Beer  Bourbon. Wish they let you choose the beer, instead they gave us the not so great Oskar Blues Mamas Yella pils, maybe because no one drinks it. The bourbon was good, and perfect to set you in the mood for a savory burger! I got the burger done medium with aged cheddar. WOW. The potato bun was soft, Cheese was delicious savory and rich. The burger cooked perfectly melted in my mouth. This is one of those burgers you don't need ketchup or mustard or dressings, its plainly good meat on a bun. The fries were disappointing, pretty standard, could use some flavored seasoning. Love this spot its got a nice look. Easily in the TOP 3 BURGERS  I ever had."
"This place was my jam. Hailing from England it was tough to find somewhere that at least had a respectable homage to home. Owen and Engine had that, and I embraced it with every order of Yorkshire Pudding, Bangers & Mash, Bubble & Squeak. Unfortunately, the past two times I've been there (months apart as the initial bad experience left me really bummed out) there just hasn't been the same level of service as there once was. I don't know if there's new owners, a new chef, or something that could hint as to why things changed but sadly, they have.The yorkshire puddings are poorly/underdone at the best of times, the fries were undercooked and soggy and the onions for the burger are no longer consistently done (this time they seemed way under) and the service seems to have lost its charm. The first time I had a poor experience I did my best to be courteous and polite and complain (the food arrived cold). Sadly all they did was reheat my food as opposed to giving me a fresh, hot order. Who knows, maybe I had 2 very unlucky days. I'm sad that I can no longer recommend this place as my favourite place to go. I hope I can find another charming British-style pub to feel at home with again. I just feel like Owen & Engine lost their focus when they included a Banh-Mi sandwich on a British menu."
"We went for a late dinner on a weeknight.  Tried the Scotch egg, Kale Salad, Cornish Pasty, selection of cheeses, and something else that must not be on the menu anymore because nothing else looks familiar.  It was all wonderful - I recommend it highly and without reserve, and we will be back to order more little plates to split and nibble.  It's a FANTASTIC space - dark  with a beautiful bar, and I'd love to spend hours here just sorta letting the world pass me by.  I'd also like to try the tea service, which I really have to remember to write down.  I don't see if online, but if I recall, it was full tea service with scones and cream."
"This place is amazing! Have gone there multiple times and have had a great experience every time. The service is great and the staff is friendly. Alex (our waiter) made great suggestions as far as the food.Last time I was there I tried the Slagel Farm burger (local grass fed beef) and just added bacon to it... it was phenomenal!! One of the best burgers I've had in Chicago (top 5 place). Have also tried the pork rinds,  empanadas and both were great. The pork rinds were spicy so just be careful. The beer selection is also great and is always changing... def worth a try.While you're there make sure you check out their outdoor patio... very cozy place! I highly recommend it and will likely be back soon!"
"Owen and Engine always seems to have the capability to keep me coming back for more. I have come here times before to have beer, burger, and bourbon on Tuesday nights and they never disappoint, especially for the price! Tonight, a Friday night, was exceptional. The bar tender, Elliot, started our night off with excellent drink recommendations and friendly service. Both bartenders were very knowledgable of both drink and dinner menus.We started with appetizers including pickles and the pretzel. Pickles were flavorful and each vegetable had their own unique taste. The soft pretzel was a great texture and taste, but the cheese sauce really stole the show. I could eat the sauce straight. For my entree, I ordered bangers and mash. The dish as a whole was hearty and the flavors of all components blended together perfectly.Overall, the food and service were both on point, but expect a wait. My meal was great and I would recommend Owen and Engine to anyone!"
"Great service. Good food. A wonderful brunch spot.I ventured over to Owen & Engine yesterday for Sunday brunch and found a quaint, old English styled restaurant. They got the details down (all the way to the English china).I got the crispy kale salad. It was lovely - fresh, flavorful, and not oily. It was a good healthy choice. Other dishes we ordered were the steak and eggs and the traditional English breakfast. They were also tasty. One minor issue for us was that the steak was cooked too well-done when we asked for medium rare. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. He came back several times to ask how everything was and introduced us to a few beers with small tastings, which my friend greatly appreciated."
"I'm finally getting around to reviewing Owen & Engine. Why the hold up? Because I didn't love the burger and I wasn't sure what to think about that. I have always heard O&E has one of the best. And I was unimpressed. It was fine just not in my top 10. However, don't let my opinion stand in your way. Give it a shot, particularly on a Tuesday when they have it on special. That said, I loved this place. Just the ambiance alone would draw me back. I love a British pub. This would almost be like the real thing except its much cleaner than any British pub I've been to in England. A differentiation from the original that I think we can all appreciate. We sat upstairs which is a charming room with a bar, couches, TV, small tables. Sitting at the couches and having some pints with friends looked really appealing.I'm going to be redundant for a moment and repeat what everyone else has already said. Get the Scotch Egg. So delicious and not to be missed. Perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked. I would definitely head back to O&E. The menu looked great. Or maybe I'll just dig into a Scotch Egg and call it a day."
"Wow... had a great experience today for brunch.  Everything was top notch.  The greeting at the door was warm and pleasant.  The server was quick to say hello and let us settle in.    Started off with scones and a Scottish egg.  Umm yeah.  Some of the best scones I have ever had.  Im not even a scotch egg fan, but this one was really tasty.  Moved on to the Eggs Benedict and steel cut oatmeal risotto.  Holy fantastic.  Who doesn't love a proper crumpet with their eggs?  Both entrees were crazy delicious.  Did I mention the streaky bacon was SUPER good.     Service was very attentive without being smothering and always with a smile.  I will definitely head back to try this place again and explore more of the menu."
"I am a sucker for lists- and one of the best burgers anywhere is supposed to be at Owen and Engine. I would say it was good-  what makes it worthy I suppose was it's size- which was decent,cooked as ordered, nice toasted bun,  it came with an Aioli sauce which was different, but not much more tasty than Mayonnaise ..a little better I suppose. The fries that came with it were perfect- the price was 15 bucks, before you add on cheese, bacon or a fried egg topping.  So, this burger can easily be 20 bucks.On a Saturday night, at 6:30- the wait for a table was 45 minutes to an hour- the bar area, was cramped and it was really hot in the space-  Staff was very friendly, and did the best they could with the crowds.  I was surprised that the host and hostess even remembered my name and where to find me when my table was ready, and it was exactly a 45 minute wait.  The waitress (Beth) did a super job.Nice beer selection at the bar, some of it priced low- some high."
The food is always very good here and we always get sat very fast. I decided on the burger. The flavors were awesome and it was cooked perfectly. In all it was a nice experience and we will be back.
"Since I've just written up one five-star ampersand restaurant--Longman & Eagle, natch--why not double down? Here it goes, with Owen & Engine.I'd been told that title rights to the best burger in Chicago belonged to Owen & Engine. After a detailed fact-finding expedition, I'm ready to award my belt. It goes not to the fine folks at O&E, but instead to the divine burger produced by Au Cheval.That said, Owen & Engine takes home the silver thus far, and not insignificant award considering my burger standards. One, I love me the thin patty. If I want a hunk of beef, I'll grab a steak. My personal opinion: thick patties sacrifice flavor for juiciness, and walk a fine line at producing said juiciness at that. Owen & Engine's pub burger goes thick.It's a fine thick burger, though, and I like it above the legend that is Kuma's. There's more juice and more flavor at O&E. Sure, Kuma's gives you virtually unlimited freedom to top, but that's like adding barbeque sauce and baked beans to your simplistic yet perfect brisket. It's about the meat, and O&E does it better.There's plenty else on the menu other than just a burger, though. Start with the delectable malt vinegar aioli that accompanies the burger's fries or the fish and chips order that the wife picked. There's more British pub and general upscale bar favorites too--see the scotch egg or the locally sourced charcuterie board that Yelp's reviewers have chosen to feature. And no, I didn't try the bone marrow, but a second glance at that uni butter is making my mouth water.Ah, and the cherry on top: tea time is available, with homemade scones to boot. That's a wife-pleaser for sure. Also, fun fact: a blueberry scone tastes great with bourbon. It's science."
$12 for 5 tortellini. Twelve dollars. The portion size was less than a bowl of cereal.What.
"Cosy, clean, relaxing and sophisticated affordable British gastropub with excellent bags and mash, fish and chips, service....The size portion of dishes is fair.It is easy to park around here and conveniently located near a movie theater."
"Agree with previous reviews, best burger in the city.  Just went their this weekend and yet again O&E does not dissapoint.  Hubby got burger it was amazing as usual.I am compelled to write this because not only is the burger amazing but the rest of their food is just as amazing.  I just love this place.  I had the Shrimp Sausage and Grits... never on my radar but ordered on staff rec... amazing.  Please, for the love of god, order the cookies and milk dessert... it's a slice of heaven.  I am craving it 24/7 after going there!!"
"Went on a Friday night, late. Ordered two dishes my friend and I split, the salt beef sandwich and the Burger. The burger was great, well cooked, kinda medium, just hit the spot, the salt beef sandwich left a lot to be desired, essentially fell short. I wasn't expecting it to be that salty. My friend and I stopped half way and started drinking alot of water. I guess in the name it says salted but still it was wayy to salty for me. Maybe some people like that I really don't know but for us it was too much.Aside from that it wasn't too busy around 11pm on a Friday night, they are open late so it was helpful. Atmosphere was great, the ambiance was pleasant and lighting was dim, expected for a late night dub/bar/restaurant type feel. Definitely could come again but wouldn't eat that salt beef sandwich again Lol."
"One of the few place that I have been to that actually lives up to the hype. I don't personally think you should wait over an hour to eat here, but if you can grab a spot at the bar, it is so worth it. The food is amazing! I came here with my boyfriend and we ordered the mussels, bread pudding, and steak. We finished the meal off with the banoffee tart. Everything we ordered, we ended up splitting, which I think, in the long run, saved us a lot of money. We also were able to try more things by splitting everything, which is a plus. At first we didn't think this was going to be enough food, but it was actually really filling. The steak was to die for and I absolutely loved the muscles. The bread pudding was good, but I generally prefer sweet bread pudding. The banoffee tart was also really good, but a little bit hard to break into.Overall, I was really surprised at how much I enjoyed eating here and if I were back in the area again (and the wait wasn't that long), I'd for sure come again!"
"Very inviting restaurant. Great food. I had their burger, it was very good.Fireplace upstairs was on but looked like a nice place to relax. Not a cute area to walk around in but perfect for a dinner and movie (since o&e is next to a movie theatre)"
"I love Owen & Engine. I love their food, their staff, and the atmosphere. If I had to guess, I've been here roughly 30 times. Their burgers taste like steak to me and I eat them at least twice a month. They're my favorite in the city. I recently came in for brunch and their biscuits with hunter's gravy were delicious. I love their ribeye and Yorkshire pudding. I could go on about their food but I'm sure you've all eaten french fries and aioli before.They always have excellent beers on tap. Very non-pretentious, exceptional restaurant in my opinion."
"Holy Beer List Batman!There's a lot of good things to say about Owen and Engine, but I have to start with the beer.  Just about every gastropub and restaurant these days is expected to have a quality beer list, but over time you see the same craft beer names again and again.  And that's not necessarily a bad thing, but I do like being challenged by a beer menu to try something new and fresh, and Owen and Engine continually changes up their menu to offer a lot of new and exciting beers that I haven't tried before.  Also, if you're a fan of Pipeworks, chances are good that they'll have one or two good Pipeworks beers on the menu.Ok, enough about my alcoholism.  Onto the food.  I've had some great meals over here.  The only thing preventing me from five stars here is I'm not always sure that the portions and the quality is equal to the price.  You can spend a pretty penny ordering at Owen and Engine and have had some comically small orders at some hefty prices.   That being said, their pretzel with welsh rarebit is probably the best you'll find anywhere, is priced very well and gets my mouth watering just thinking about it.On top of that, they make a delicious and flavorful bangers and mash, which is an excellent choice and have a memorable cheeseburger as well which is even better when ordered on a Tuesday.  On Tuesdays you can get a great burger, a beer and a shot for $16.  The staff has always been great whenever, I've gone and the ambiance is hard to match.  The long bar is great to sit at and the overall atmosphere is cozy and warm.  As its a popular destination, you might find it difficult to grab a seat on busy nights and times, but the wait isn't typically unreasonable.  Happy to live so close so that we can go here as often as we do.  Keep up the good work guys!"
"This review is for O&E on their BBB Tuesday nite.  BBB (burger, beer, and a shot of bourbon) is now $16 pp as price was upped by a  $1 recently for first time in 3 years apparently.  It was still a 5 star deal for us, as both the wife and I had their special.   At the core I'm basically a burger and beer guy, and I couldn't have asked for a more delectable meal on this nite.  The beer for the BBB special tonight was a Bob's 47 lager (5.2% ABV and 18 oz serving) from Boulevard Brewing in KC.  At first, I was somewhat disappointed it was a lager (not generally my favorite type of beer), but upon seeing and tasting it, it had good color and a richer taste than a standard lager, and I'm now a fan!  The bourbon was a Zachariah Harris brand -  again I've not heard of it before, but it was smooth and I'll be glad to have more of it anytime!  The burger was great - it had distinctively great flavor, it was thick and maybe totaled 1/2 lb I would estimate, and it was still very juicy while being done medium.  Just having carmelized onions on the burger was perfect  as far as I was concerned.   Many reviews have already reported on the upscale burger blend recipe and the taste is positively distinctive.  On BBB nite, this is a 5 star deal.  At regular price of $14 for the burger and fries, it would be on the slightly pricey side I would say, but you're then paying for other things like the extensive beer list here and the ambiance.  On the dining and ambiance - yes,it's a small space even with two floors (see photos), and I'm glad we had a reservation. No long lines and people mulling about like at Kumas Corner, but I was told every table at the time (5:30pm) was on reservations.  I don't have a feel on what a walk up wait might be like here.  Free street parking can be found on Diversey and also the side street (Schubert Ave) that the Regal theatre and Fat Willy's are also located on if you're lucky.  On the ambiance, I was curious as to what I would think of the ambiance from reading the past reviews, as I've been to some of London's quintiessential pubs.  Overall, a great place and nice vibe here, but it's actually spacious compared to some of London's quaint places, and lacks the old and natural woodiness of some of the 200 year old places in London.  It's also better lit than many of  London's pubs as they don't have the luxury of as many windows as at O&E.  This isn't a knock - just an observation, and it's nice to be able to compare first hand.  This place is in the ballpark though.   It's sort of analogous to us in the USA not having authentic Spanish tapas bars,  it's hard to do as it's not economic for one for the business.   O&E has been there for 4 years now, and anyway, I plan to be back again.   Kitty was our server.  She was attentive and friendly and answered all of my touristy questions!"
I love the layout of this place.  Try to get seated upstairs where it looks like you're dining in someone's home.The burgers are the best in the city and the Fish and Chips are incredible but a little on the pricey side.  Almost as good as Duke of Perth's Fish and Chips.Can't wait to try the bone marrow next time I go.
"This little pub has a very authentic British feel, with plenty of beers to choose from, including Cask Ale. Showing up without a reservation we were seated promptly, even with a group of 4. The service was very prompt, and the food was very good. Owen & Engine is primarily known for their burgers, but the clams, sausage, and muscles with Lobster bisque caught my eye. I'm glad it did because it was delicious. I would recommend the meal to anyone, and I will be hoping it's still on the menu when I return. Overall I give them 4 stars."

"I would probably give four for the food,but the service was so slow it offset that extra star. Went there for a birthday dinner for a friend. More English pub fare. They have a pretty good Scotch Egg. because the mustard it comes with is a nice dipping sauce. My husband and I were most impressed with the lamb meatballs. They were very flavorful and even managed to split some with a crowded table of 10 people. The burger wasn't bad too. Can't go wrong with a Slagel farm burger. I went out on a limb to try the bone marrow, but it left much to be desired. I would have liked some meat to cut the fat. There were two dips to help with that and I was looking forward to the bacon jam, but it wasn't doing it for me. It was actually the nut butter that reminded me of Thai food that did the trick.We wished our experience could have been better, but when it took a half hour to get our drink orders or even a steak knife it really did offset our opinion of the food. One of our friends ordered a steak and it didn't even come with a steak knife and then the waiter was MIA for a good portion of time and still didn't come back with one when bringing back refill beers ordered 15 minutes before. Not sure if they just had one wait staff for the second floor, but even though our waiter was nice it just seemed bad management of the floor. Maybe give it a chance again if I am not in a rush to see a movie. If not just for the lamb meatballs."
"What's not to love about Owen and Engine?? Great food and drinks, decor, service, AND easy parking! (There's a garage across the street connected to the movie theater where you can park for $2 all day; pretty dope if I do say so myself!).  I've been here twice so far but somehow forgot to write a review the first time.  We made reservations the night before for this past Friday for a group of 7 people and had no problem.  They also were very accommodating since one friend requested that we be seated near a TV so we could also watch the Hawks playoff game.   One friend and I arrived half an hour early for our reservation and were seated without needing the whole party there which was great.  We were seated on the second floor which is very quaint and the dark wooden decor makes you feel like you're at a fancy grown up dinner at a friend's house (my friends and I aren't that posh just yet). Our server was very sweet and friendly.  Our table had the fish and chips, burgers, bangers and mash, and pan roasted chicken thigh sandwich.  Everyone was very happy with their choices but I can only attest to the bangers and mash and chicken sandwich.   Bangers and mash is basically pork sausages over mash potatoes and gravy.  Even though this sounds very simple it is still very tasty comfort food!  The chicken thigh sandwich was pretty great; the chicken was topped with vegetable slaw, fresh avocado, rasher (bacon), pickled lime charmoula (marinade) with a side of chips (fries).  The chicken was tender and the veggie-avocado slaw added a refreshing element to the sandwich since it had a nice contrasting, crunchy texture.  We stayed well past dinner just sitting there chatting and our waiter never made us feel rushed or unwelcome, which I greatly appreciated.  The next time I come I want to take advantage of their Tuesday special: $15 for a burger (the burger alone is $14), a bourbon, and a beer!   Also, Owen and Engine is located right next to Fat Willy's Rib Shack which I've been wanting to try as well..food crawl here I come!"
"This place is way, way, way too cool for the northwest corner of 2700 N. Western Ave. Chicago IL.  I mean, someone built an Olde English Pub from scratch and placed it across the street from a Regal Multiplex and next door to Fat Willy's Rib Shack? Who does that?  [Answer:  the owners of Fat Willy's Rib Shack.]Sitting at the second story bar, I had a perfectly crafted vodka gimlet, followed by a trio of beers on tap, each one better than the other--the names are unknown to me, but one was tart & citrusy, one was smooth, and one was dark and tasted of cherries. Thanks to the bar staff for introducing me to these outstanding brews. This was accompanied by small plates of delicious lamb meatballs and crostini.  The service here is swell. Since I just barely scratched the surface of the menu, I'm sure I will be back whenever I happen to be in the neighborhood. Maybe some day I will even understand the name."
"A quaint British pub on the edge of Logan Square. Owen & Engine offers flavorful pub foods, friendly service, and a long list of beers. They offer all of the classic English dishes you'd expect, and a few extra dishes as well. The burger is delish, a solid 4 stars, though maybe not as earth shattering as others make it sound. Fiance fell in love with the lamb gyro, which is sadly no longer on the menu. I absolutely love the malt vinegar aioli that comes with the chips! The intimate sitting room space upstairs is great for drinks with a small group. Owen & Engine is somewhat of a hidden gem worth the venture to check out!"
"After dining at Owen & Engine, I had the same reaction I had after seeing Donnie Darko.  Really?  That's what the hype was about?My group showed up with a reservation at 8:30.  We stood around for at least 15 minutes, waiting to be seated.I tried the vaunted Scotch egg and thought it was just a mediocre appetizer.  Hardly worth $6 per egg.The flavorless soft pretzel ($6) came with a disastrously greasy dipping sauce.  It looked like snot.The house-made breads ($6) were okay, but I don't know if I'd order them again.I did enjoy the pork rinds ($5).  Nice combination of salty and cheesy.For my entree, I went with the super-hyped burger and thought, I've had better at Kuma's and 25 Degrees.  For $14, it should be tastier and less greasy.  I got their house made ketchup and mustard and wished I had some straight up Heinz.  The ketchup tasted like tomato Kool-Aid.  The bacon on my burger was undercooked and 95% fat.Cocktails are $10.  I had the Tempest.  It's not listed in their online menu, so I can't report what it contained, but I liked the aftertaste more than the actual taste.Our server had a knack for butting in while one of us was mid-sentence.  I think we were interrupted every time she swung by.  And our entrees took a very long time to come to the table.We walked away having paid $50/person after tip.  I'm willing to pay that for a really good meal, but nothing I ate at Owen & Engine merits a return visit."
I had been wanting to try this place because there is not too many options in the area but unfortunately due to the horrid service I never even got to try the food. The host and wait staff are as smug and arrogant as you can get. After being treated by 3 different employees like it was a privilege for me to be there I simply walked out. I will not be back
"We chose this place to try something off the beaten path gastronomically because as we all know, British food doesn't have the best reputation. It's somewhere between eating a tire and really bad leftover dollar menu fare. But pub food is the way to go when you're traveling in the UK. So I wanted to introduce my little brother to the kind of stuff that you would NEVER see on the menu at 95% of the restaurants in Chicago. This establishment more than proved itself to be an outside of the beltway kind of joint!The building has been so many things as the years have gone by, about as many face lifts as the theaters across the streets have had owners. The interior is definitely at throwback to the pubs out of the 19th century. Wainscoting, man. Wainscoting. With two floors and a bunch of small intimate tables you can get your food and converse without feeling flooded by noise coming from other tables.A nice beer list full of local, domestic, and international choices helps you decide what to pair with your food. I had a Spanish cider with a definite full body and a strong olive-like after taste. And then Zombie Dust to finish off.The food is amazing. Our beginning entrees were the Scotch egg, with great mustard; the liver and sweetbread skillet had a great little cornbread and gravy sauce. We also had another completely delectable, natural buttery mushroom flatbread pizza. So good! Probably the best of the bunch. Our main entree was the rack of lamb. Mmmmmmm.  Fatty grilled meat with a so so sauce and under paired with veggies. Tad disappointing.Our server was completely friendly and uber nice the entire night. Even after we sat around and talked for so long gulping down beer and water to sober up for the crap weather. Thanks, Maggie!Get here. Be ready for a bit of sticker shock, but so worth it! :D"
"My date loved the food. I hated it. Got grossed out by the fish skin in my fish and chips but guess I'm not one to like fish skin.  Couldn't stand the smell of it either. Waiter didn't even bother to check to see how the food was and when I asked him to take it away and why,  he didn't bother to offer to bring my anything else. $80 meal and I'm still starving. Very unhappy"
"Great date spot.  Cozy, dark, cool vibe, chill music, street parking, good drinks.  I had the shrimp and sausage grits.  It was definitely a winner.  The grits were well cooked and if i wasn't on a date I surely would have licked the bowl.   I heard that have great burgers and even have a special on Tuesday nights.  Will go back once the weather breaks to see whats in season."
"There are many philosophical questions in life, some well-known, some less so.  As I drink my glass of garnacha tonight, three come to mind:(1) What is the sound of one hand clapping?  (2) If a tree falls in a forest and no one hears it, does it make a sound?  (3) Can a cheeseburger be too juicy?At Owen & Engine, you'll only be confronted with one of those questions.  But you may be surprised at the answer you reach.  Not because O&E is in a forest, but because its burger is the fattiest of fatty burgers - with its high short rib and brisket content, it is oozing fat and juice.  Its almost too much, and it certainly has a unctuous, earthy flavor.  This is a powerful hunk of meat.  One may say that no burger should have this much power. You may want this burger cooked a little longer than usual, to sweat out some of the fat and grease.  I recommend adding the cheddar, which adds a very necessary dimension to the flavor of the meat.  You may hit a wall, but if you do, the cocktails are large and strong and can heal your gastronomic catastrophe.Definitely visit on a Tuesday, for a $16 burger, beer, and bourbon shot special.  On any other day, the burger alone usually costs almost that much!  Dine with someone who doesn't like bourbon, for the extra shot."
"My friend and I went here for brunch a few weeks ago and had pretty good experience overall. The service was very good, even when we stayed long after we were done eating.  We went there on the weekend expecting brunch but were slightly disappointed to find they were only serving a small lunch menu. My friend and I ended up splitting a French toast sandwich and pretzel and both were very good."
"Hits and misses:Scotch Egg: HitGreat Beer section: hitFrench Fries: hitSteak: TOTAL MISS (hint, the $25 filet is not filet minion...they also burned it when I asked them to cook it medium. Not over cooked, burned)Burger: mediocre hit...(greasy and big...I've heard this described as the best burger in Chicago. It was just not my thing...too much with no lettuce tomato and onion. If you hate having veggies along with your burger, you will probably love this burger)Pretzel appetizer: almost miss. the dipping sauce is fabulous (it's beer and cheddar cheese) but the pretzel was salted so  it made the whole thing too saltyAlso, our server just was not good...at all. Inattentive and when he was there he made everyone at our table uncomfortable. The meal also took sooo long to be served.If I go back it will be for drinks and nosh."
Unbelievable!  Both food and service!!  The selection of beers and the amazing fresh ingredients for the dishes was so much more than we ever expected!  Don't let the neighborhood or outside of the building fool you. We are in Chicago for only 3 more days and will come back before we go home!!!!
"I've always had consistently great service and food here. Great beer list, prices are right and the burger is so damn perfect it doesn't even need cheese."
"Very disappointed at the food. We came in on a Wednesday night before catching a movie right across the street. We had the scotch egg and peanuts, they were okay.. I had better scotch egg at the Gage before.. For entries we got the duck breast, it came with 5 pieces of duck, and the sauce was very sweet. We also got the chicken roulade, which tasted pretty dry.. There were many things on the chicken plate, but the flavors just didn't go together.For dessert, we got key lime custurd, it is seriously the worst dessert i ever had. They used the same source that was on the chicken plate..I came in hoping this place will amaze me and we ended up with a bill over $100 (with drinks) and not satisfied."
"Let's start with the obvious: Owen & Engine has excellent  English food, including the fish and chips and the scotch egg.Now the less obvious: really good, house-made charcuterie plate that even my Jewish mother enjoyed (we didn't tell her what she was eating; it will make for a good story one day).And the slightly more obvious because of the press it has received: best burger in the city. Not sure it's that close either.DEAL WITH THAT, BRENDAN SODIKOFF."
"I love burgers, and this place ranks as my #1 for best burger in Chicago (so far). They season the burger so well, it's cooked to perfection, and they don't use any toppings besides sauteed onions and maybe cheese/bacon (upgrades).Tuesdays are their special, beer bourbon burger for $15 which is an absolute STEAL... so reserve ahead and come here on a Tuesday. This also comes with their fries, which are also delicious. You can't really lose out here, I'll be coming back for their burger for years to come."
"Went here late on a monday evening with my hood rat girlfriend not knowing what to expect. Small dimly lit place with lots of character. We were seated and greeted promptly by the most helpful and energetic server. Ended up getting scotch egg, bangers and mash, and the burger. All of it was delicious, but I wanna talk about the burger. Ive been to many of the popular  burger joints in the city, including Au cheval, Trencherman, etc. This burger takes the cake. It is not underwhelming! Its a massive hand pattied burger (a good inch in thickness) served on a delectable potato bun with caramelized onions and a side of malted vinegar mayo (i usually hate mayo, this shit was a nice addition).  You can opt to add a fried egg or aged cheddar. I added the cheddar and was not disappointed. It was refreshing to see a burger that was not  a perfectly shaped patty, apparently once frozen. the texture still had the crumbliness of ground beef indicating it was pattied fresh. It was cooked to order a perfect medium and incredibly juicy. Only critique I have, and i dont even know if its worth mentioning, was that the bottom bun became a little juiced logged  and it got a little messy. maybe the bottom bun could be a little thicker? who cares. Ill be back."
"I originally wanted to try the fish & chips, but the brunch menu looked enticing so my fiancé and I stopped by one Sunday morning right as it opened.  The restaurant is located conveniently off the highway.  You can park in the movie theater's garage for $2, which is located across from the restaurant.  We started with a mimosa for me and a Red Snapper (similar to a Bloody Mary) for my fiancé.  I enjoyed the mimosa, which is the quintessential brunch drink.  He enjoyed the spiciness of his drink.They offer small plates, which I found very appealing especially if you don't have that big of an appetite in the morning.  We tried the scotch egg and the assortment of miniature scones.  The scotch egg was cooked to perfection with a crispy exterior coated in bread crumbs.  I loved the sausage wrapped around the egg and it all worked really well together.The scones were so delicious!  In fact, I can't stop thinking about them and I've now developed this weird obsession for finding the best scones in the city.  They came with three scones - blueberry, chocolate chip and early grey.  They were served with clotted cream and house jam, which was some sort of strawberry/raspberry jam.  The clotted cream wasn't too sweet and paired well with the sweeter scones while the house jam paired well with the earl grey.  They had just the right texture - hard on the outside (but not rock hard like other poorly made scones I've consumed) and crumbly on the inside.  Get them.  Trust me - you won't regret it.For our entrees, I tried the Eggs Benedict which was served on homemade crumpets (like English muffins, but less dense and more sponge-like), house rashers (thin slices of bacon), fried eggs and traditional hollandaise sauce.  It's served with a lot of sauce so I'd recommend ordering a side of brown bread so you can soak up all the sauce's creamy goodness.  The rashers were nice and crisp and the eggs were cooked to perfection.  Overall, an excellent savory brunch dish.My fiancé tried the house salt beef hash.  The beef was served in cubed pieces and a generous portion was offered with the dish.  It also came with potatoes (perfectly cooked and crisp on the outside), onion and a crispy duck egg.Our waitress was very attentive and she was constantly checking up on us to make sure were doing well and had whatever we needed.  She was also extremely polite and friendly.The ambiance is sleek, modern and clean.  Also, the music was great and wasn't too loud or distracting either.Overall, excellent brunch!  I definitely want to stop by for dinner so I can get my hands on the fish & chips."
"I went here on their Burger special night, which is Tuesday. You get a beer and a shot of bourbon with a Burger. What a deal! I have been told these burgers are good. I've been to Kuma's, which is also a highly raved about burger place. I love how O & E only had one burger to choose from. I got it, cooked med rare, and it was amazing. The beef was oh-so-delicious! It really was one of the bests! For apps, we also had the scotch egg, pork rinds with Mole , and pretzel with cheese and mustard sauce. My favorite was the pretzel by far! The pork rinds were very good too, but also VERY HOT! Just a warning to those who only like a little bit of spice. The scotch egg was soft boiled and yummy, I had never tried one before and it was cool looking. There was an herb that stood out in it - possibly sage, but over all, the product was pretty good. Our server was great and the manager was very nice as well. Can't wait to come back!"
"Fabulous! We actually had a 9 PM reservation, but ended up in the area at 7:30PM. They fit us right in, no problem. Great beer selection & the food was exceptional! Will make this a regular stop on our trips!"
I spent a summer afternoon on the patio here drinking great beer and falling in love - what else is there to say?
"I love this place for so many reasons and I can't believe I haven't written a review before.  I always come for the the Tuesday burger special (see other reviews). The burger is phenomenal and DEFINITELY worth the $15!!   We came today, on a Friday night.  They quoted us 45 min.  As usual, we snuck up to the bar and swooped into open seats within 10 min.  We ordered the burger (you have to), the sepia bone marrow and the pasty (only bc my bf is British and he insists on eating British foods). The burger, as usual, is amazing. Definitely one of the top 2 burgers in Chicago- and if you take service into consideration, the best burger in Chicago.  I was a bit drunk when I ordered and forgot to add cheese and a fried egg- these are essential FYI.  Upon receiving my burger I looked at my bf and said the F word very discreetly.  Another employee who wasn't serving us noticed my distress and immediately knew that I wasn't satisfied with my cheese less burger.  He offered to add cheese- which I accepted, and asked for a fried egg... Because that's how I roll.  The pasty was good- per the Brit.Now the sepia bone marrow... I have to admit that I wasn't impressed.  And it wasn't because the dish wasn't good- it was!  I was just expecting the bone marrow to be more like a schmear (sp?).  We came here maybe 2 months ago and had the most amazing bone marrow spread upon bread.  Think better than purple pig or Au Cheval.  Today, that dish no longer exists... But when it does make a come back to the menu, order it. You won't be disappointed.  At 10:22 we and the rest of the patrons at the bar got a free round of whiskey at the bar- the reason I can't recall but I don't question free alcohol.Overall, I love this place and I will be sad to leave Chicago in 4 weeks."
"Loved the atmosphere. Felt like I was in some european city. I do have to say - I was a bit skeptical before coming to this place - but I was quite satisfied when I left. I had a little difficulty trying to decide what I wanted to order, but alas I let go of my bias and just ordered the things that jumped out at me. I ordered the soft boiled egg and the paneer and fried chickpeas. The food was great! This place is right across the street from the movies - so if you are trying to plan a date - this is the perfect place to go for a bite to eat and a couple of drinks while waiting for your movie time! I hear that there is some sort of a deal on tuesdays both at the restaurant and at the theater!"
"We came this past weekend for a quick meal after watching Godzilla across the street. We ordered scallop special (tasty, but are you supposed to slice already small scallops?), elk (tough and gamey which we expected and the fried item was good! Not exactly sure what it was though. Not impressed with the dish), fish and chips (clear standout, entire dish was good, great with the clam sauce), clams with chorizo (another good dish with good strong flavor), bone marrow (disappointing, amount of uni was negligible, better at other places). I don't know how to describe service. He was very helpful because we had to be out by a certain time so he pushed the kitchen. But at the same time, we couldn't decide between a couple of things and his insight didn't really bring anything new to the table. Also, we got charged for a different table. Granted, we were in a hurry so that didn't help and he fixed it after I pointed out the mistake. But we were 1 of 3 tables on the floor. The meal was a little expensive for the amount of food we got, but our items weren't cheap. Overall, I would just stick to what they're known for like fish and chips and come back on a slow day with plenty of time to prevent any mishaps."
"The burger really is all that. The meat is high quality and essentially tastes like ground steak on a bun. Added cheddar cheese with the grilled onions.Fries were near perfect, but I didn't dig the aioli or the house made roasted red pepper ketchup.Started with the house made breads, a nice variety of four, which was served with herbed butter and a delicious, savory bean dip that had strong Indian spices.Cousin enjoyed her fish and chips, which I had at my last visit. Perfectly cooked, not too greasy.Great service, large selection of beverages."
Stopped in during a walk around the neighborhood on a sunny Saturday afternoon for a beer and a snack!  They have a great selection of both drafts and bottles.  Their staff was very friendly and engaging and had great recommendations!  The scotch egg came highly recommended and did not disappoint!  The bartender filled us in on some specials throughout the week and we will definitely be back!
"Amazing experience Sunday night. We had a party of 9 and so we got to try many things on the menu. Everything was great. The service was impeccable as well. Not just that they were always on top of everything, but so much more knowledgable about their menu and food than most places. Great recommendations all around.Highly recommend this place."
"Tuesday nights at Owen and Engine are Bourbon, Beer, and Burger night:  for a mere $15 you get a bourbon (quality one, too, not crap), beer (last time it was a Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald, so again, quality, not crap), and a burger.Let me state this is the best non-kitsch burger I have ever had.We all know what a kitsch burger is - we've been to Lockdown and Kuma's.  No, Owen and Engine is not a kitsch burger place but just a damn good burger with great cheese and bacon should you want said bacon.  No crazy meats, no crazy sauces ... just a damn fine burger.I would be shocked if there was a better burger deal anywhere in the city.124/365"
Love everything about the place. Small and unassuming. Excellent service not at all pretentious. THE FOOD WAS BREATHTAKING.
"Food is an experience here. Or maybe what I mean is that they have the best, juiciest, expletivist hamburger my silly American tastebuds have ever landed on. I probably mean both.When you're coming down from the sick-feeling high of any overproduced Hollywood output across the street at the Western Avenue Regal Cinema, return to our dark earth slowly. Enter a dim and relatively low-ceilinged Brit bar called Owen & Engine (laughingly, if you know the trivia that it's owned by the neighboring Fat Willy BBQ folks!) Be greeted by expansive smiles. Be seated at narrow tables. Determine your draft over close candlelight.Perhaps I over-romanticize this place because my husband tends to insist we shall not enter without Reservation. And yet have! Each time is a minor miracle, which I immediately diminish by ordering the 'burger. Find this low class? Order the juicy, oniony, prime-cheddary, bun-mazingly burger and then we'll talk. Maybe."
"Came around 9pm on a Saturday night with my boyfriend.  There was no wait, and we got to sit upstairs.  The upstairs had a nice atmosphere.  There was an energetic group of people celebrating a birthday party, but the area upstairs was relatively calm.  This was my first time here, and my waiter informed my boyfriend and I that their specialties were their burgers and fish and chips.  Their burger sounded amazing, but I had a burger for lunch.  The waiter said that the fish used for the fish and chips is delivered fresh everyday.  Fish and chips sounded great as well, but I wasn't in the mood for anything fried.   I opted for the seafood and grits.  The grits were creamy and also had a kick to them.  There was also a tomato based sauce used.  This dish was not what I expected, but in a good way.  People on Yelp have left so many good reviews about the burger though, so I'll have to come back and try it next time."
Fantastic food. Their hamburger is delicious and their (Amish farm) chicken....omg. Definitely going back.
"How many ampersand restaurants are in Chicago? There is a good chance that if it has an ""&"", it's probably good. And that was certainly the case with O & E. Can I call you that? Sure.Super cute, dim, pub like feeling, but not at all dingy.The menu consists of apps, small plates, entrees, and sides.Pretty standard, but there was nothing on this menu I wouldn't order... except for bone marrow. I had it in LA and hated it, so I'm over it forever. Moving on.Apps consist of scotch eggs, cheese and meat plates, pretzels, and nuts.Their small plate section is a little more involved with things like kale salad, flatbreads, bone marrow, soup, etc.They have a large cocktail and draft list. All of the drafts are listed by alcohol content. I approve! They have wonderful seasonal beers here on draft-- I'd say about 15? That is pretty awesome. Their cocktails are also $10 instead of $12-$14 like other places in Lincoln Park for example. WIN!We started with the lamb meatballs. MM! There were 5, served over a creamy cheesy polenta. I would get those any day.Then, we got the pumpkin gnudi (teehee), which is a lighter version of the gnocchi, I'm convinced. It had little chunks of pumpkin with marshmallow-y buds of the gnudi pasta covered in shaved cheese and rich sauce.The presentation of the meals here are fantastic. We finished with fries and PEI mussels. They include some oysters in there, tons of garlic, and a little ghost pepper!! However, you couldn't really taste the heat. Sad :(There were about 20 mussels in there-a wonderful portion size.I will come back again very very soon. I really want to try their charcuterie ($19), their burgers and flatbreads- mainly because they put fried eggs on it.. ooooo."
great beer selection delicious burger need to get back and try more items on this menu. This place is up there !
"This adorable pub is such a gem! I don't typically associate British pubs with stellar cuisine, but this place is the exception (or maybe I'm mistaken). Our English friend recommended we meet at Owen & Engine for a Saturday lunch. We arrived at 12:30 and there was plenty of seating, but as soon as we sat down, the restaurant quickly filled up. The service was awesome. Our waiter (the bartender?) was sure to explain everything and made great recommendations. We ordered a Cornish Pasty for the table- apparently this is always on the menu, but the fillings change daily. Ours happened to be shortrib and it was phenomenal. The crust was perfectly flakey and the filling was tender. It was served with a generous side salad and a chutney. The server gave a detailed description of the handmade burger and I was sold. It came out perfectly medium and covered with caramelized onions. When I asked for mustard, they mixed it up fresh- who does that? Talk about fresh and homemade. The rest of the table did fish & chips and were equally impressed. The batter was light and the portion of fish was generous. The beer list is extensive and there isn't any TVs - refreshing that the the spotlight is the on food and the company. Excited to go back when I am in the neighborhood!"
"This place hits the 3.5 mark for me. I've rounded down because the service didn't blow me out of the water - it wasn't bad, just didn't wow me, I suppose. Walking in to a reasonably uncrowded restaurant (bar, however, was full) at about 7pm, sister & I asked for a table for 2. 3-4 minutes later, where at least 10-12 tables were vacant, we were seated. Again, nothing offensive or bad there, just left me scratching my head a bit.Sat down, and water was brought to the table. About 7-8 minutes later, again the joint was not crowded whatsoever, our server arrived and made very good recommendations on food & beer options available. I went with the short rib, sis with the fish & chips. Beer (Hennepin, 18oz for $6 - nice!) came out very promptly. The food came maybe in 10 min or so, and was very very tasty. Really liked the fries (chips, since we're in merry old England), and the short rib sandwich was super tasty, but a bit on the greasy side. Had a bite of the fish, which was also good. When plates were cleared, we declined dessert (albeit the chocolate bombe looked outstanding) and asked for the check (cheque?). Maybe 10 min later, it was returned and we paid & left.In summary, food was quite good (need to come back for the burger night, apparently on Tuesday), beer selections were extensive, but the service could have been better during a reasonably uncrowded night - not bad, but speed somewhat lacking. I'll definitely be back to try some of their other items and drink from their superb beer list."
"What a treat! Bloody Mary tasted good but not great. Could have been dressed up more than a few green beans but it only got better from there. My girl and I opted to split 3 things... Salmon plate, vegetable quiche and plough man's platter. Salmon came thinly sliced on homemade brown  bread , cream cheese, capers, dill and hard boiled egg. We added some lemon juice and this was a standout. The ploughman's platter had two kinds of cured meat, cheese , apple chutney, hard boiled egg, pickled vegetables, horseradish creme fresh , more bread .... Good stuff.The vegetable quiche which I think had cauliflower and asparagus was a real treat as well. Extensive craft cocktail and beer list. Only able to order off the brunch menu on Sunday...Will definitely be back for lunch menu. Only $2 to parking theatre parking lot unlimited  time ."
"Well again I was dying to come here with all the hype around it. Cool little English pub feel. Quite small but fun, minimal decor and design. I heard it had a fab burger. So, I got it.But first, we got the bone marrow. Yes, very very good. It was super flavorful with toasted brioche. Very buttery and creamy with sides of bacon jam and nut butter, but it's actually better just on toast. Then we got the burger, fish n' chips and sweetbreads with chicken liver. The burger was pretty good, not great. Pretty salty and came practically bare with just caramelized onions. Expensive for coming so plain. Mostly just over seasoned. Fish n' chips were again good, not great. The sweetbreads and chicken liver were fried beyond belief, and mostly all breading. Huge disappointment. Good beer selection, although they didn't have 2 beers I asked for, so ""sigh."" Overall it was expensive and just ok."
"I Need to go with 5 stars as this is the best burger I have ever had!   The Tuesday $15 burger beer bourbon is a great value. A real working mans dinner. We were nervous about not getting a table as they were booked with reservations for the dinner hours. I called an told them we were coming anyway, and they did in fact hold a table for us! At first I was confused as too why cheese did not come on the burger. Its an add on with an additional charge, but you don't need it! The meat is extremely juicy and a ratio of 80% lean. some%brisket. And some% magic or chuck or something.  Also the potato bun was soo buttery there really is no need for cheese. This day the cheese option was an aged Cheddar which i requested to be unmelted and on the side for nibbling. Another add on option was back fat Bacon! Not just any bacon, but a chunk of swine back. Well played O&E. The meal comes with really good fries and aoly dipping sauce. In our group one of our friends had the burger at Au Cheval. though it is talker than The O&E burger, This one tastes better and is uniquely well thought out with articulate accessories.The beer selection is crazy with many across the pond English varieties. Most drafts are In The $7 range. Their Malort shots and other aperitifs start at $3! Now for the lesser important facts. The ambiance is very classy and it was would be a great date spot or impressive client dinner. Its more than just a great value on a Tuesday.  They really put together a nice pairing  of good beer and quality Bourbon with a burger that changes slightly week to week. See ya next Tuesday!"
I can't believe this place only has an average of 4 stars!!!! The food was absolutely amazing and service was incredible. Hands down one of the best meals ever in my 4 years of living in Chicago!
"Let me preface this by saying that I grew up in this area and have experienced the gentrification first hand and have always welcomed the idea of my hood changing. For the most part everything that comes along with more money being dumped into an area has been more than positive, until I walked into owen & engine. I am Hispanic with dark skin and to be honest, never cared to notice or was unaffected by any under currents of racism. I  always felt others who played the race card were being hyper sensitive and ignorant of their own behavior that may cause someone to treat them a certain way. All in all I always cringed when a person of color proclaimed some establishment as being ""racist "", until I met the bartenders and servers of this place. I cannot tell you that they did anything rude or objectionable in anyway. They didn't! I was with a friend who is white and she seemed to have a wonderful time. I did not. I can't stress it enough that the servers did their job correctly, it's just the ever elusive ""vibe"" I got. That vibe that read, what are you doing here? My friend and I are both very outgoing and started friendly banter with the servers ( that's part of the fun!) it's just wierd they rarely responded to me and directed 99% of their dialogue to my friend. I felt rejected and told my friend about it toward the end of our meal. She felt really bad and I excused myself to the bathroom. When I came back the servers were being overly hospitable and beaming with smiles toward me. (She definitely said something ) ugh I appreciated the caring nature of my friend to stand up for me but I felt even more embarrassed and isolated. I really just wanted to get out of there, so we did that. I was done feeling like I didn't exist and then feeling like a freak that everyone needed to be nice to. I won't be back."
"I'm extremely impressed. My English grandma would be so excited to see this place. Just walking in and seeing how beautifully it's arranged and the lighting was enough to make me melt. My boyfriend and I went for brunch and I was absolutely delighted to see eggs and soldiers. If they don't make their butter there please don't tell me because it tastes house mouse. We also got the pasty (which apparently changes pretty frequently - another love) and good gravy it was tasty! Between the dressing on the salad the the curried veggies I was in flavor heaven! We split the fish and chips that we paired with some really tasty beer. Our waitress was great because she was able to take our taste into consideration when she was pairing our beers with our fish. Absolutely delighted with the food, the service, the drinks, and the atmosphere. This is definitely my favorite gastropub I've been to here in the city."
"Love Pub Food, British, Irish, American, a cuisine of itself. This is a gem. Went there for mothers day, and  the mother is not usually so keen on pub food, but she like it here, maybe it was because he son was buying! Great beer selection. All the help staff were foodies, so they where proud and chatty, and friendly. Fish and chips, bangers and mash, curry chicken, all very good. The scotch egg maybe best in town, I will have two next time.Small, causal, pub feel place. neighborhood location."
This place is fantastic!!! I love the olde pub style atmosphere and the excellent drinks and service.  We didn't have food on this visit but I can't wait to return to try the delicious looking grub.
"The food was unique and delicious! Not your usual menu, but I absolutely loved it. Our waitress wasn't very attentive though."
"I really feel like a bad Chicagoan for not going here sooner.  Everything I ate and drank was amazing!  A few friends and I wandered in here after seeing a movie across the street.  We were quickly seated by friendly staff.  Our server was awesome - funny, extremely knowledgeable, and made great food and drink suggestions throughout the meal.  We all shared the Cornish Pasty to start which I believe was made with beef tongue - not something I would normally gravitate to but we trusted our server and I'm SO glad we did because it was delicious!  Then we, of course, all had to have the burger to see why it has made so many ""Best Burger"" lists.  It WAS the best burger I've ever had anywhere, not just in Chicago (sorry, Au Cheval).  We added the aged cheddar to our burgers (another great suggestion from our server) and they were cooked to a perfect medium-rare...absolutely amazing.  I had the Victorian Pimm's Cup and my friends tried a few other cocktails and drafts - all were great!TL;DR - Go eat their burger immediately."
"Holy Shit.Just go.Now.(Tuesday - Burger, beer and shot of Bourbon for $16)"
Yesterday I was with me momma traipsing through the city and we got very hungry and wanted to find a place to eat. We couldn't decide so we looked up a place near by and chose at random deciding on Owen & Engine having never been or even heard of the place. I must say it was the perfect choice!! The atmosphere is great feeling like a pub in jolly ole' England. It gets busy quickly so a reservation should be advised but the food and the drink selection is worth it!! The Mons and I were thoroughly happy.                                       P.s. I would suggest getting the soft pretzel to start because its off the chain!!
"Recently discovered Owen & Engine while exploring my soon-to-be new neighborhood and already have become hooked. Love the vibe here; sophisticated yet unpretentious pub with some incredibly personable staff. The downstairs has an energetic atmosphere and I love sitting at the comfortable bar seats and socializing with the bartenders. The upstairs is stunning and has the feel of an old fashioned spacious, elegant living room; dark lighting and plush leather seats. There is also a small but nice patio on the upper level. The beer list is at O&E is outstanding; such a great variety of craft beers on tap, all served in glassware specific to the beer's style. Each visit there is at least one new beer on hand for those like trying a wide variety. There is also a nice cocktail list featuring quality spirits, yet with extremely reasonable prices. Elliott Beier has created a top notch beverage program. In addition to the wonderful staff, what really elevates Owen & Engine over nearly every single pub I have frequented is the quality of the food program. I have been slowly making my way through the menu and am so impressed; this is not at all ""bar food"" but is on par with an upscale restaurant (though much more favorable pricing). Executive Chef Bo Fowler and Pastry Chef Jenna Crille are immensely talented. As a snack I love the mustard glazed pretzel served with a delicious melted cheese sauce. The burger here is one of the best in the city IMHO; so juicy and a wonderful tasting bun and great chips. The tuna melt on rye (made in house) was fantastic and at Sunday brunch the steel cut oatmeal risotto with a poached egg, confit pork and grilled brown bread is not to be missed. Most surprising was the Lapsang Souchong creme brulee; this might just be the best dessert in Chicago right now. An expertly prepared crème brûlée with a pronounced smokey flavor as well as notes of bacon; it is accompanied with cherries, meringue and other goodies that create a tantalizing blend of different textures and flavors that marry perfectly; quite a masterpiece and it is worth a trip here just for this dish alone! Probably my only beef about the menu is everything has been so incredible that each visit I am torn between repeating a prior order versus exploring something new. Since I will soon be residing just a couple blocks away I anticipate spending many happy evenings at Owen & Engine and am ecstatic to have such an amazing venue so close to my new abode."
"Dropped in a few days ago for the burger deal. This used to be one of my favorite burgers in town. Great quality of meat, under cooked to bring out the succulent flavor and texture of the burger.Unfortunately, it was either an off night or the quality has gone done. Burger was overcooked, and felt way more greasier than I remember. Fries were way over salted, unnecessarily so. Also tried the fish and chips, which the server boasted about the freshness of the catch. Unfortunately, the restaurant relies too much on how fresh the fish is versus actually adding any flavor or spice to the fish. I'm fairly certain that the only spices these guys have in the kitchen are salt and pepper. For the price - I think the place could benefit by being a little more creative with their recipes.Otherwise- service was OK, and the drinks were great."
"Best burger in Chicago. Hands down. Grass fed brisket mix. Yes please. Great service, too. They take the whole pub experience seriously and it shows."
"All summer long, I have been eating out and Yelping a lot.  Owen and Engine has won the award for the most AMAZING everything.  I joined four other friends out for my belated birthday dinner two weeks ago on a Thursday evening.  We have been going to restaurants that were on Metromix's list of Best Bars for Beer Lovers.  Everything about my experience was out of this world.  Owen and Engine is definitely my new FAVORITE restaurant in Chicago.We were seated at a table near the kitchen, and our server was Tracie.  She was the best!  She was super funny and just added to the whole experience to make it even better.  We decided on ordering a bunch of mostly small plates so that we could try a lot of different things.  From the Snacks, we tried the pot of housemade pickles, the cheeseboard, and the oysters.  The pickles included pickled strawberries, which were a surprise to see pickled and surprisingly tasty.  All of the cheeses on the cheeseboard were phenomenal.  It came with a jam which complemented the cheese nicely.  We tried half East Coast and half West Coast oysters, and I ended preferring the West Coast ones.  They came with an excellent vinaigrette and were some of the best oysters I've had since leaving Florida.For our main course, we ordered the pizzette, the scallops, the fish and chips, and the beef tartare (which I didn't try, given that I don't eat meat, just seafood).  Scallops are one of my favorite things---these were seasoned and cooked to perfection.  My mouth is watering now just thinking about them.  The fish and chips were my other favorite, the aioli that  came with this dish was awesome!  Everything was absolutely fantastic!Because we were out to dinner for my birthday, Tracie hooked us up with dessert on the house.  We choose the ice cream sandwich.  This was the most gourmet ice cream sandwich I've ever had.  I wish I could end every meal with one!  We were so happy with our experience, we decided to purchase a case for the kitchen, which is listed on the menu. They were really happy and came out to thank us.Owen and Engine, I think I'm in love."
"Everything we had for dinner was excellent: the krispy kale salad, pan roasted chicken, and the best ribeye steak I've had so far.The lighting here is perfect and lends a very cozy and warm ambiance, which makes an ideal setting for a winter dinner."
"I'm giving this a place 4 only because the service was horrendous. It would probably be a 3.5 if I could but I'll round up. When we were waiting for our table the bartender ignored us after we told him that, and after we were seated we had the same server/bartender who didn't greet us for about 15-20minutes. However.. EVERYTHING I consumed was amazing. Pretzel, burger, beer, bourbon! So good!"
"Tuesday's Special: The burger, fries, a shot, and a draft beer for $10! Hard to beat that deal. The burger is one of the best I've ever had, no cheese needed since the flavor is so huge! Will definitely going back frequently."
"This is By Far one of my favorite places to go out for dinner or for a few drinks. Such a cozy place and all the employees are very friendly and knowledgable about their menu. Love the bartenders and their drink options, very unique and selective about what they offer. If you love beer and bourbon and burgers you must come here. I've never had a bad thing here and probably have been here 50 times in the last 3 years. I love the scotch egg, bangers and mash and burger. I also love that the menu is ever changing since they are farm to table and bring in seasonal local fare. I just can't say enough good things about Owen & engine."
"One of my favorite places in the city. Always consistently great. Service is always friendly and knowledgeable from the hosts to servers and bartenders, to the food runners. We were told the wait would be about 30 minutes. Sean knew we were waiting around and let us know that a seat was opening up shortly so we ended up waiting for less time. I can not say enough about Sean. He was attentive while not hovering, knowledgeable about all items on the food menu, efficient, remarkably friendly and polite. The food always tastes delicious (from burgers to fish and chips to their steaks have been my favorite). I would just make sure to ask the staff if the plate is a light or hearty dish. Since I did order a light dish this time around, I was still hungry after. Lots of beer options as well! Quite a variety of options actually. Great staff, awesome food. Always excited to go back."
"This place is one of our favourites in Chicago.  I could go on and on about the excellent service, the fantastic cocktails, the wide range of tasty beers, and the delightful decor.  I could go on about all that stuff, but I won't.  This review is reserved for one thing and one thing only.The burger.I can honestly say, without an ounce of hyperbole, that Owen & Engine's burger is the best burger in the known galaxy. When I think of the things that I love more than anything in this world, this burger is second only to my wife and family.And it's a very close second.I would drag myself through a mile of broken glass and swim through a pool of iodine for one sniff of this delicious burger.When I eat Owen & Engine's burger, I shed tears when I'm on the last few bites...because I don't want the experience of eating the burger to end.In the grand scale of human achievements, this burger is more important than the Great Wall of China and the Moon Landing.  Combined.One night I dreamed I was walking along the beach with the Lord. Many scenes from my life flashed across the sky. In each scene I noticed footprints in the sand. Sometimes there were two sets of footprints, other times there was only one. This bothered me, so I said to the Lord, ""You promised me that if I followed you, you would walk with me always.  Why, when I needed you most, were you not there for me?""The Lord replied, ""The times when you have seen only one set of footprints, my child, that was when I was at Owen & Engine, eating their ridiculously delicious burger. Have you had it? It's fantastic.""Seriously.  This is the best burger you will ever eat in your life."
"I dream of this burger. Everything else is wonderful too. and the PIMMS CUP-- delish!Service is a bit over the top but once they recognize you they drop the silly spiel (this farm, that local, corn fed blah blah blah)."
"Swung by here again (FINALLY) to get some dinner before seeing a movie next door at the Regal Cinema.  Little did I know that Tuesdays they have this magnanimous deal where you can get one of their infamous burgers, a beer, and a shot of bourbon for $15.  SIGN ME UP!!  The burger, topped with nothing but caramelized onions) was very juicy and delicious, and the beer was a stout (I forget the brewery) which paired nicely with the meat.  And of course I got a scotch egg to go with my burger.  Because you can't come to Owen and Engine and NOT order the scotch egg.  Definitely will be coming back for their burger/beer/bourbon deal again in the very near future."
Great burger and awesome beer list.
"I visited during Sunday brunch. It was great! I love the relaxing feeling you get just entering the place. Our waiter was very friendly and easy going.  He helped us with the menu, since it was our first time here.  We ordered the Pastry board, which is a little biggie size because of the cinnamon roll. So be careful, you might not order that much afterwards(it was just two of us, and we ordered the 3 for 12 option).  But our favorites were the croissant and the popovers.  Our favorite dish we ordered was the flatbread, which I can't find on their online menu, but its there! The flatbread was a savory dish which we needed after indulging in the pastry board.  We also tried the crumpets, which I really enjoyed, granted I've never had crumpets.  They are just like a flat version of an English muffin and if you add their spread, it was just a simple deliciousness 'toast' per se. I'll be coming back to try their other menus.  I also tried their Duchess drink, which is very tart, and their Campi di Fragole, which was my favorite of the two because it felt refreshing. :)"
"Lots of gastropubs in Chicago. Of the choices, this should be on the top of your list. Good atmosphere, great food. They have noncarbonated beer (semi flat, 55 degrees- like English beer) available, as well as many other options. Do yourself a favor and get the burger and bone marrow. A wonderful combo which will satisfy the most discerning foodie."
"This is one of the neater restaurants I have been to.  When you go into this dimly lit restaurant, and if you are brought upstairs like we were, you feel as if you just stepped into a 19th century home and you feel like you are eating in the upstairs living room, thanks to the classic decor.  It is quite the experience indeed.We ordered the pretzel and the CHARCUTERIE  as an appetizer for 4 of us.  The meats and cheeses were truley amazing and mind blowing, I especially loved the Italian sausage and the head cheese.I ordered the burger with fries, which apparently was the number 1 seller on their menu, since these were flying out of the kitchen to the vast majority of customers.  The burger was thick and juicy.  The meat and 8 year old chedder was really good and high quality, especially since they get the meat from a farm completley fresh.  I am a very fair Yelper and refrain from biases.  I will be honest here also, I did not enjoy my burger all the way because of those dang carmelized onions!  Their onions are too sweet for me, usually when I get carmelized onions they are delicious and not sweet, these were too sweet for my taste and, in my opinion, ruined my burger.  This is only my opinion not fact.  The fact is these onions went well with the burger and were of good quality, but I am just anal about sweets on my meat.  If you are like me please skip the onions when ordering.  I will be back here for sure to try the burger again with NO ONION!  I dare not drag them down any stars due to my personal preference.  A good food reviewer will know quality even if he or she does not like it.  If these onions did not match I would have dragged it down some stars, but they matched but just not my cup of tea.  In the past I have had to review foi gras and I dislike that stuff but still know quality when I see it, or taste it, even if it makes my stomach turn LOL.  Now the fries were oversalted, but I am not going to go dragging down stars because of something petty like french fries.  But they could use to cut back on the salt.  I was really thirsty afterward and my lips burned from the salt pieces.Overall, this was an excellent dining experience, and I will be back soon for burger redemption to have the onions off the burger!"
"BURGER SPECIAL!!!!! OMG YES!  I've tried far too many burgers in the city.  I've done ""burger week"".  I've done Dood Food Tuesdays.  I've still never had a better burger.  This place is crazy consistent.  Delicious fries.  Fantastic deal.  Other food is great too, but if I'm coming here anymore, it's for that amazing special!"
"A fantastic meal. We started with the homemade bread selection, which was delicious and so much more satisfying and interesting than you would ever expect breads to be. It featured 4 different breads -- a small pull apart, toasted baguette, thick and buttery brown bread, and a special polenta bread -- with absolutely delicious nordic butter and a seasonal spread with creme fraiche. I cannot recommend this highly enough.Next, we shared the burger. This burger is INCREDIBLE. It was a perfect medium rare: juicy, tender, and extremely flavorful. I ***highly*** recommend getting the cheddar and rasher add-ons. Both complemented the meat perfectly. I cannot wait to go back to this place! Adorable decor and ambiance, beautiful dishware, and great service."
"I came in here late the other day and just got the burger, added cheese. It was fantastic. Other than that I just had water, so I was pretty boring. I was also turned on to a new band since the bartender had a pretty great playlist going."
"This review is based on many previous visits to O+E... always great food and service. Good strong cocktails, worth the money spent. Definitely a unique interior... check out the other floor if you're eating/drinking on the main floor. Tuesdays.. Beer, Bourbon, and Burgers.... what else can you dream of?"
"Came here for their burger/beer/shot for $15 special which was awesome. They are known for their burgers, so I was excited to try it since I love burgers. When they brought it out I was super disappointed because it came basically plain. To say I love ketchup would be an understatement, so when they told me I shouldn't eat my burger with ketchup , I was annoyed. Who are you to tell me how to eat my food!?But.....they were right. It was perfect on its own - super juicy and with great flavor. I would like to go again to try some of the other items on the menu. Perfect place to go before a movie with the theater right there."
"We came here just for snacks.  The desserts were a disappointment.  They were not that sweet or rich, which I felt I was rightfully expecting since I ordered dessert.  It was just an overall unfulfilling experience for me... # SCOTCH EGG.- I think this is what people in the UK had envisioned when they created the scotch egg.  THIS WAS A PERFECT SCOTCH EGG.  Thin crispy bread crumb outer shell, with an inner shell of sausage meat that was just barely thick enough to appreciate the meatiness of it.  The egg was soft-boiled, and it oozed as i cut into it.  We somehow managed to split this into 3 parts, but I would recommend maybe splitting it with one other person, or even better.... EAT ONE BY YOURSELF.yelp.com/biz_photos/owen…# STICKY TOFFEE PUDDING, Steamed Date Cake, Toffee, Basil-Mint Ice Cream, Vanilla Cream.- The cake itself was ok.  I should have probably not ordered this.  True to the name, the cake tasted just like dates.  Wait, correction... it tasted exactly just like dates.  Maybe a good/impressive feat for anyone who loves dates, but it was a bit overwhelming for me.  (Sorry... this is like the vegetarian going to a steakhouse to rag on the meat...)# CHOCOLATE CURRY PUDDING, Sweet Potato Doughnuts, Stout Cherries, Marcona Almonds.- I forgot this had curry in it until I came home to write this review.  The part that stuck out in my mind was the ""chocolate"".  Anyway, this pudding did not taste chocolately.  Did I taste the curry in this? Not really either.  It was just bleh.  I disliked the cherries since they tasted kinda medicinal."
"Their burger is so good you will be a little sweaty after you eat it. It only comes with caramelized onions, but that's really all you need (although adding bacon certainly didn't hurt!). The fries are also ridiculously tasty. Service has always been friendly and fast even though I usually go on Tuesdays to get their $14 burger/beer/bourbon deal, which I'm sure is one of the busiest nights of the week."
"Food:Delicious gastropub with an authentic British flair; a relatively concise menu with consistent execution and interesting flavor combinations. Their charcuterie plate is also fantastic and they do a mean brunch.Drinks: Great beer selection, fresh cocktails and some pretty fantastic french press coffee.Vibe: This place feels like a mix between a British pub (downstairs) and a cozy ski lodge (upstairs), where either way you'd want to sit for hours. Good for a date, getting together with friends or even flying solo at the bar.Is there really anything else left to say?  Go here."
"I just overheard the bartender say to a patron:""We're knocking it out of the park in every direction we can.""I don't think that waiter is cocky, I think he is accurate. I've never met a bartender here who is not extremely knowledgable and passionate about the top notch liquids on hand. I've never eaten anything here that did not change my life. Once by accident I paired the By The By with the Flatbread (id est, I ordered the cocktail and flatbread with independent consideration for each) and it was the best decision of my life; it transported me to a different time and place. I've never know a cocktail to pair well with any meal until now. You should try this."
"If I could give 6 stars, or 10 stars, I would.Burgers are my favorite thing on this planet. I consider them more special to me than my own children will be some day.I really don't want to get too emotional here, but Owen and Engine has the best burger in the entire city of Chicago, possibly the world.  As of right now, I am willing to say it's the best in the world.  I've eaten thousands of burgers...I have credibility in this department.  You'll never know if that's true, but just trust me as a fellow American citizen.Quite simply, it's the best. Slagel Farms, top quality, grass fed...and cooked to perfection.  It melts in your mouth.  I have literally drooled onto my plate out of the corner of my mouth while eating it.There is only one burger there.  It comes with carmelized onions on an unbelievable potato bun, lightly toasted.  That's it.  And that is all it needs.  I don't even like onions, so I get the burger without it...that is all it needs.  No cheese, no bacon, you will essentially be wasting your money because this burger needs nothing extra.  It's that good, it's that special.A big popular thing in Chicago and in the U.S. in general right now is having many varieties of burgers, with all kinds of unique crazy toppings.  That's cool, but O&E one burger to choose from.  And it's the real deal.  Nothing compares.  Get it.They have a great beer selection, too, apparently...but I don't drink, so if that's your thing, check that out too."
Nice spot! Serves food late which is a plus. Great service. Food is always great too.
"I'm a little perturbed that I haven't reviewed this place yet, considering that I am always recommending O&E to friends. O&E has become a staple for what my friend Marissa and I call ""Red Meat and Whiskey Night"". I've already given up on any and all fast food cheeseburgers. I'm also really sick of out of town visitors insisting we go to one of those played out burger places whose toppings include everything but the kitchen sink. People of Chicago, YOU CAN DO BETTER. LET ME HELP YOU.Anyway, you know you've got a good burger when all you need are some grilled onions and maybe a slice of good cheese (none of that plasticy Kraft crap). No, you're not going to get a burger with a bajillion slices of bacon, avocados, poached pears, or other pointless stuff at O&E. However, you will get an superior burger with simple toppings and simple sides (chips with aioli!). Add in one of my favorite Manhattans (Get Buffalo Trace, on the rocks, DON'T QUESTION ME) and you, my friend, have one of the best red meat and whiskey combos in the city."
"The man-friend had to be in Logan Square for some school stuffs, so we decided to venture out of the 'hood and try a new place. I fully admit I picked Owen & Engine because of it's proximity to easy parking ($2 at the theater garage next door! or, go see a movie after dinner and get that parking fo'free!). Moving on... I like the interior of O&E, it's smaller than I expected but super cute. I can see how reservations would be kind of necessary if you want to go at dinner time. Decent beer list, and a menu with lots of things that I wanted to order. I decided to get the mussels for my meal & a side of brussels sprouts because, duh. So yes, I ate mussels & brussels, & they were delicious. The mussels is a huge order, so you can defintely eat this for your entree, and it's plenty to share. The bread it came with was really good, and it had some sort of meyer lemon spread on top of it. The man-friend had the charcuterie platter & he really liked it. I think it's a great little spot & worth checking out, for sure."
"Owen & Engine is an upscale English style gastropub.  The woodwork is very beautiful.  We had been meaning to visit for a very long time, and we ended p stumbling in on a Tuesday and found out they have a special where $15 buys you a beer, a burger, and a shot of bourbon.  When you see the size of the burger, you know it's an awesome deal.  We also wanted to try some small plates, so we only ordered one of those specials and split the burger.  For small plates, we ordered the peanuts, the scotch egg, and the pretzel.  The peanuts were a little sweet for my taste, but the scotch egg was to die for, and the cheese dipping sauce that came in the little cast iron was delicious.  The burger was amazing in its simplicity.  It's meat and caramelized onion.  That's it.  And it's incredible.  Ron Swanson would be proud.  Now for the beer.  Owen & Engine is a destination for the beer alone.  They have one of (maybe the) best cask program in the city.   If you haven't tried cask beer, you need to get some here.  They usually have all 4 casks going on weekends. There's also 18 regular drafts well balanced between style and place of origin.  They have some pretty rare offerings.  If you go to a movie across the street, you should always stop here after for at least one.A fun moment happened between 10 and 10:30.  The beautiful clock behind the bar stopped within the first week of opening.  When the real time matches the clock time, the entire bar gets a free shot of bourbon.  Overall, we had a great experience here and we will definitely be back."
"This is the closest bar to my house and I couldn't be more happy about it.  On nights when I'd get off work late I stop for a beer or bourbon drink and cant help but look at the late night food menu they offer. The hard part is deciding how hungry I am. The peanuts are a great choice for anyone that wants to snack on something while drinking their beer. They have complimented every beer I've had them with but be careful, they are addicting. The jar of pickles! Oh my. Changes all the time but has always pleased my palate.I've ordered the pretzel when Im a slightly hungrier and I love it every time. Warm, soft and glazed with mustard and served with side of mostly beer and cheese, how could I not?My friend and I shared a flatbread with bacon lardons, ramps, and two fried eggs on it and she still talks about how good it was. The first dinner I had there I split the half chicken with my roommate. We rock, paper, scissored for the leg but I'm not mad I lost and got the thigh! Perfectly cooked, served with mash and seasonal veg, all sitting in a puddle of delicious jus. We couldn't finish the entree only because we previously demolished the bread basket we ordered (also great) but I can assure you, the leftovers were not wasted. As if the food wasn't enough to make me a regular, the people working there are amazing too. Its hard not to befriend the bartenders there on a slower night because they are so friendly. They are very knowledgeable and always aim to find customers something they'll love. If you go in on a night when Jameson, Elliot, and Jeremy are all working, then you've hit the trifecta of cool dudes tending bar."
"Went here with 3 girlfriends for some post work libations. Cute outdoor seating area upstairs, if the weather is nice.  Otherwise, the interior is fairly typical of a dark pub.Food recommendations:*Kale salad: even the non hipsters can appreciate this fine veggie combo*Slagel Farm Beef Burger"
"This place has been on my checklist for a while because a coworker of mine dared to say there is a burger out there better than Au Cheval's.  I have yet to try Au Cheval's burger but all of my other co-workers couldn't believe he would say such a thing.  All I know is after trying this burger, Au Cheval's is better I'm in!  It was so rich and tender and awesome.  Plus the fries and aioli dip were great.  They also had dishes with beer pairings, we had an elk steak and it was delicious.  Not to mention the bar staff were super friendly and funny.  So if you want a place with a cool feel and awesome food definitely check this place out!"
One of the best meals I've had! We got there at five with no reservation and were seated right away. The service was wonderful our waitress was very kind and knowledgeable. The food was divine! We got the bone marrow and the sweatbreads and they were so good! The citrus it came with was a perfect accompaniment. Overall amazing meal.
"I know this place has a great reputation and a loyal following.  It is quite likely that Sunday night's visit was simply an aberration, but given the poor experience I feel compelled to put it out there for the management to read this and make sure their game is consistently high even on a Sunday night.  We arrived at 4:45 p.m. to get an early dinner before dropping my son at ORD.   We were told that the kitchen doesn't open until 5 p.m. but that we could order drinks and certain apps/bar food until the kitchen opened shortly.  The drinks were excellent as were the starters - Scotch egg, crispy Kale salad and the cheese Board, all of which arrived quickly.  The problems started when we ordered dinner at 4:55 p.m.  First off, our food didn't show up for almost an hour even through the place was just beginning to fill up and we asked about it several times (letting the server know we had a plane to catch).  Second, when the mains finally arrived, the burger and beef sandwich were excellent (and certainly didn't require an hour to cook); unfortunately, the third entre, the rack of lamb, was a disgusting, fat-laden, inedible hunk of grey meat for which they had the audacity to charge $28.   Our advice is to stick with the usual stuff, the bar food and not anything more.  We'll return and give this place another chance, but we'll be wiser."
"I've never been to England but I feel like I can save the $$$ and venture to O&E.I jumped on the first chance to visit O&E after having this restaurant on my ""places to try list"" for a really long time. I dragged the hubby on a gloomy weekday (made it feel even more England-esque) and told him to trust me, he'd love it.We walked in and to my surprise, there was no wait. Woo hoo! My favorite 2 words (no wait) when it comes to dining. Upon walking in, I noticed the amazing Old English decor, dim lights with a couple dudes at the bar and a few couples sitting by the window. We were sat at the furthest table from the door, which I considered another success since it was cold out.Our server immediately approached us, told us about the specials and what to expect from O&E, such as popular items/drinks, etc. I found him so cool because he was extremely down to earth and really knowledgeable about every weird beer question hubby had. I then ordered the fish and chips (my belly is smiling just thinking about it) and hubby had a cask beer with a burger. We never had a cask beer before so we were a little confused if it was supposed to taste flat. The server instructed that because it's hand pumped, it doesn't have the bubbles we're used to with regular beer. He then showed hubby other beers and offered to let him sample another one and switch it out with no problem. Hubby got an IPA instead and was as happy as a camel on humpday. My fish and chips were freaking perfect and my hubby said his burger was within the top 5 of his life. I was treating this meal like Gollum in Lord Of The Rings and only ate half so I could savor the rest tomorrow for lunch. It was my preciousss.It's cold and gloomy out again. Looks like I need to make a stop at O&E ASAP."
"This is a great place to go for a cozy dinner, weekend brunch, or grab a quick drink and snack before the movie.  Stepping into the place transports you to a vintage English pub, or even someone's home.  I love the decor, from the tiles and wallpaper in the bathroom, the comfy furniture you'd find in a friend's living room or dining room, floor rugs, and dimly lit fixtures.It can be pretty packed on a Saturday night, but there's always the option to sit at the bar on either the first or second floor.  The servers on the second floor go out of their way to make you feel comfortable and to find an available seat if possible.  They are also cognizant of the time if you're trying to catch a movie across the street.  The drink list is extensive, as well as their daily specials.  Hubby had a full body Christmas ale.  We split the pork rinds and the pretzel appetizer.  Both were enough to tide us over before the movie.  I've also had their fish and chips before, which were good.  I'd like to come back to try their weekend brunch (available on Sundays) and their sticky toffee pudding."
"Can I say AMAZING!!?!?The burgers here are just phenomenal. We go as often as we can for the Tuesday burger, beer and bourbon special. I don't even like beer or bourbon! I give them a taste and then pass them over to my husband who enjoys them, and a ride home from me. Eat the burger as is, and enjoy the fries with the malt aoli dipping sauce. We have gotten the pretzel as an appetizer several times and it is my favorite. Staff is great, but it is always crowded. Make a reservation!! My husband is very upset I'm giving this as a review, as he says, ""the less people that know about it, the better it is for us!"""
"Whoah. Heard the burger was great and that there was a Tuesday special, so I stopped in.1. They choose the beer for the special. Tonight it was some gross blonde. Skip the special unless you need cheap abv. 2. The burger was disgustingly greasy. Gross. I would've rather had a good burger from red hot ranch for less than half the cost of this one. I feel sick and my tongue is numb. Verdict: even if it wasn't expensive it'd still be awful.For the record, the beer list is good, and the fries were solid, so it wasn't a total loss. But I did have to order a non-special beer, defeating the lure of a special. (People who think this is a top burger in Chicago are out of their minds.)"
"Big fan of Owen & Engine not only because it's walking distance from home, but they have amazing food and a great selection of beers.  The fish & chips and burger are both amazing.  I recommend the cheese and bacon additions to the burger, because why wouldn't you?  My wife also tried the ribeye and that was also fantastic.  They take a lot of pride in the meats they procure from farms that I assume are local-ish.  It's a great place to hang out and drink too.  Check out the upstairs for a more cozy environment with some comfy seats to drink, another bar and some more tables as well."
"Owen & Engine is a cozy English gastropub located on Western near I-90. I visited the restaurant on a Tuesday night to take advantage of their BBB special - for $16, you get a shot of bourbon, a beer, and a burger with fries. The special is only available on Tuesdays, and is easily the best deal in town. I have only had their burger, which was one of the best I have ever had. Make sure you get it medium rare with cheese on top. The restaurant does take reservations, and I recommend that you take advantage of this service (we waited an hour for a table without having a reservation.) I would like to come back to try some of their traditional English food. and beer. I will be recommending this restaurant to my friends."
"Visited Owen & Engine on August 15th at the invitation of my future son-in-law David.  David will be a welcome addition to the family if he keeps his focus on great food AND adds outstanding places like O&E to our stable of go-to places.When I crave a burger, which is about once a month, I want a really good one.  And to make my demands more particular, is that I recently went Gluten Free, so I need a place that will let me bring in my own buns (from Rose's in Evanston; but that's the subject of another Yelp Review). The waitress explained that their menu is unique and they even make some of their own ketchup and pickles.  They described their burger as combination of brisket, ground beef, and I believe, rib tips.  Quite a trifecta!  Well, that combination of taste has launched O&E to the top of my favorite burger places.The fries were also very good.  They do offer the burger with bacon and cheese and egg.  I only opted for the cheese.  Maybe next time I add the egg and/or bacon, but honestly, this baby doesn't need the help."
"Going with 5 stars here because everything was just unbelievable. Anyone who hasn't been, I urge you to check it out. What is nice is that its a level of class for any occasion, but at the same time won't deplete your funds all too badly.We got the pretzel, which normally is 'whatever' but here I wanted to pick up the cheese dip and lick the bowl (I actually did). Wow it was good. The scotch eggs were also crazy good. Totally unexpected and blew my mind.. I came here for a burger and was already sold on this place two bites into my appetizers.I've lived in Chicago for two years, and while I have other places yet to try - this is the best burger on the list. I can call out other restaurants with a better 'sandwich' (encompassing all the bacon/cheese/toppings they add), but if we're going straight burger,meat, and bun; this place takes the lead. Truly an experience. They keep it simple and the thick patty tasted incredible. I didn't get extra toppings, it was juicy enough alone.10/10 would go back every day of my life."
"Do you miss the recent wave of gastro pubs in the UK? Owen and Engine does a nice job of replicating the experience. I've been here twice during business trips, and enjoyed each visit. They feature several cask conditioned ales on tap, and the place just plain looks pub comfy vs faux authenticity. The food rocks; this isn't bangers and mash or fish 'n chips with mushy peas, though that is fine. This is modern gastro pub fare, and it's good. If that's the experience you seek, check them out."
"My favorite spot in all of Chicago this past year, I have and will continue to try everything new off this menu.  I mean if you like burgers, GET THE BURGER, but if you like food, EAT EVERYTHING ON THE MENU.   Great meal, atmosphere, and rotating menu.  Cant get enough of O&E."
"Love the pub feel. Beautiful details upstairs.  Love their brunch (Sunday only and reservations accepted!_. Crumpets? Tea time? Yes and yes, please.Random location, but worth a visit.  If you can't find street parking, park in the movie theater lot for $2."
"I waited waaaay too long to finally make it to Owen & Engine. This place is awesome, great ambiance, super friendly staff, fantastic drink selection (including a couple of things on cask), and excellent food. I got brought in by their Facebook advertisement of a Navette conditioned with French oak, roasted chestnuts, cinnamon sticks, peppercorns, vanilla and primed with buckwheat honey and I can attest that it was an amazing beer. In terms of food, I shared a couple of plates and had the kale salad, bubbles and squeak, fish and chips. The kale salad was the star of the night for me, hitting an array of textures (good job crispy kale) and flavors (loved the sweetness of the fruit and the tangyness of the blue cheese). The fish and chips are better than any I've ever had in London and stand among the best in the city. For dessert, the banana rum pudding, a twist on the banoffee tart with a nice boozy kick. I was upstairs and really felt like I was in a cozy little pub in London. Great place."
"I go to Owen & Engine for their Tuesday deal where you get a burger, fries and a shot of whiskey all for $15.  Owen & Engine is an upscale hipster bar with an all wood interior with dark lighting and relaxed atmosphere.  They are known for their burgers as one of the best in the city.  It is a hearty burger served on a buttered bun.  They serve this with a side of fries that can be dipped in aioli sauce.  My friends and I participated in this deal and watched a movie right after a few times and it was a ball.  After a while and a few other visits for dinner I began to dislike the taste of the food from this place.  Everything seems to be over butter and over salted.  Perhaps I am being extremely picky but the food no longer agrees with me. But if you like this British like style of food then Owen & Engine will not disappoint.  This is a foodie place with a menu that changes with the fresh ingredients they are able to get within the season."
"Great spot - please-please-please order the scotch eggs. Seriously, DEVINE. So so good. If you can't already tell, I think the food is absolutely delicious. Everything that my table ordered when we went was great. I mean, you have to taste test everyone's entree to make sure it tastes good!We had a few drinks at the bar while waiting for a table. Definitely worth the price, the drink I had was great and fit the description on the menu which sometimes does not happen. Price range I quoted includes one drink.I'm seriously excited to go back, plus it's the perfect date spot. Right across from the movie theater, how can you go wrong?!?!"
"O&E has Upland beer on tap! Any fellow Hoosier will understand my excitement at this.Anyway.I've been to O&E twice now and each time has been terrific. Appetizers: Scotch Egg & Charcuterie are both amazing. Pretzel was good but forgettable. Entrees: Burger is one of the best (if not, the best) I've had in Chicago. Fish & Chips would make my England-loving parents very proud; the pea puree is worth mentioning, too. I want to try a few of their small plates and other entrees but it will be hard to not order that burger each and every time.They have a $14 burger/beer/bourbon special on Tuesday's. Both times I went was during a weekday and I never had to wait for a table. Try to get a table upstairs."
"Well, they certainly have the quirky, Anglo-ish pub name down.  This place sits at an unassuming corner next to a big movie theatre and the inside has uniquely British accents (the bathrooms are even labeled ""blokes and birds"" respectively).  I'll definitely have to visit again given the extensive pub menu, but the fish and chips were solid, though somewhat inauthentic--first, these are just fries not chips and any fish n chips must be accompanied with a bottle of vinegar by default.  I do appreciate that they have mushy peas on the side though.  Bangers n mash, the burger, and the stilton cheeses will have to wait for next time...The drink selection is impressive and I believe their English milk stout (blanking on the name) is a must-try along with their high quality scotches.  Their staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the drinks and definitely hit them up for suggestions.  So in short, Owen and engine is the dog's bollocks!"
"'Ello, Guvner! I'm really slow to getting to the new hot places, and have just discovered Owen & Engine. I was looking for a Saturday night dinner in Logan Square that wouldn't break the bank, was more casual, with less Suburbanites. A hard nut to crack on a Saturday night, nowadays in the Square! But Owen worked out great.My friend from Wisconsin swears that no place in the whole State of Illinois can do  fish fry right. Hyperbole aside, her argument is that basically she can't find many fish fries, whereas in Wisconsin every place has one on Friday nights, regardless of the Lenten holiday. I'm happy to report she was practically speechless with Owen's excellent and perfectly light battered fish in her mouth. And I concur, their fish fry is excellent!I like the Pub atmosphere of O&E, it's perfectly casual. I agree with David R. that more British beers could be on the menu, since good craft beer can be found anywhere- why not set yourself apart by doing one thing nobody else does, and holding steady to it? (A minor minor complaint, because I loved my Revolution Rosa w/hibiscus. Perfectly tart to offset the meal. But I was hoping for a crisp British Lager).We started with the potato salad, because I love potato salad. It wasn't really a salad, per se, but small Yukon Gold or red potatoes drizzled with an aioli, and topped with an unknown green that bunny rabbits probably go crazy over in the wild. The server was nice and told us all about it, but I forgot what it was that made this dish tasty. A good starter.All in all, I would definitely go back to Owen & Engine for more of their pub fare, especially for that heavenly fish fry. Wisconinite approved."
"Last night was my 4th time visiting Owen & Engine, though I wish I could go more often! Here's the scoop. I absolutely love their decor, down to the vintage silverware they give you. It's very cozy, and classic. The staff is always very nice and accommodating, and all of them wear plaid/flannel, which this girl is not complaining about. Last night my bf and I stopped in before seeing a movie at the Regal theatre next door, and per ushe, we both started with our own scotch egg. I love Owen & Engine's scotch egg, their stone ground mustard they serve with it really sets it off. And it is always perfectly cooked. We then shared a couple of small plates from their tasting menu, one of which we had MANY questions about. Our server was fresh off of vacation and couldn't remember what some of the things on a complicated dish were so he had to run to ask the kitchen for specifics a couple of times and apologized profusely, but we were just happy he was so eager to explain what exactly was happening in the dish for us. No complaints here. And thank you for letting us get some of the dishes off of the tasting menu a la carte! So nice.The first, and complicated dish, was called ""Pheasant under Glass"". It was a Dry Aged Pheasant Cooked in Hay, Crepinette, Cognac Pheasant Jus, Crispy Blood Pudding, Porcini Dirt, Huckleberries, all inside a Sugar Cage. A SUGAR CAGE. No wonder we had so many questions about it, right?! Let me just cut to the chase and say it was delicious. It was a small portion to share, but we were so intrigued, and also fairly broke ($22 for the dish) so we just wanted to experience it and got 1 to share. It was definitely an experience. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys amazing food with many different layers of flavor and texture. Delicious! We then shared the Venison Tartare, which was also very small but delicious ($16) It consisted of a Quail Egg, Anchovies, Smoked Olive Oil, and pureed cauliflower, and something crispy, I don't remember what and it's not listed as an ingredient on the menu. Delish tho. Both tasting dishes came with a beer pairing, which were yummy too! They let us split one and gave us each a half portion in a glass. Our waiter was super helpful the whole meal, but felt off of his game coming so fresh off of his vacation, he gave us some chocolate walnut praline ice cream on the house for ""our patience"". It really made our meal, and though we were not at all bothered by him blanking on what a few things were, we very much appreciated the gesture, and it was absolutely superb. That's customer service! When you go out of your way to make absolutely sure everyone has a great experience, not just giving free things to people who are upset with something and make a stink. TL;DR- Everything I've ever had here was delicious, and their service is amazing. If you value attention quality and experience in your culinary adventures, please come here, you won't be disappointed."
"Fantastic every time I have gone. Awesome decor and lighting inside. The beer menu is fantastic, and they always have good cask options (if you have never had one try it!) The food- ohhh the food. Delicious! Everything! The Scotch Egg is so awesome, the fries with the aioli sauce, fish and chips, the Burgers!! My favorite is the roasted chicken. The first time I had it, I fell in love. And Tuesdays they have a great burger deal. The perfect dinner spot right before a movie across the street."
"Despite the construction on Western Ave, this place is worth it.  They also have $2 in the lot across the street- which is better than looking for a spot on the street.  The beer selection is great!  It is a cozy setting and the fish was fantastic."
"Okay, seriously. The food is orgasmic. The service is outstanding. The drinks, delicious. I just can't get enough of this place! Not to mention, the Executive Chef is an adopted Korean from... *drum roll, please* MINNESOTA! Amazing! *happy dance and hand clap*So let's start with that it's my favorite spot thus far in Chicago. I've gone every time I've visited. Beef Tartare. Amazing. Pizzette, amazing. Burger, YUM! Cheese plates, phenomenal. Beet Salad, yes PLEASE! Charcuterie, omg! Delicious cocktails?!? Scotch eggs! Pork Rinds! Virginia Peanuts!  YES! YES! YES! The service has always been exceptional as well! I've had the same Server each time I've went; and he is hilarious! Next time I go, I really want to try their brunch! And also their lunch menu! :) All I can say is, you need to go here. ASAP."
"My experience was just under 3 stars. Cool spot. Young and hipster crowd.The short rib melt would have been really good if it wasn't on pumpernickel - a friend and I both ordered this and felt the bread dominated the sandwich. Service was a solid 5. I never got our waiter's name - late 40's man, graying hair. Serisously, this man was the top of his profession.I'd try it again."
"Loved this place.  Was looking for a cool/trendy but cozy spot to get a drink with a date on a cold night, and that's exactly what I got.  Not too busy or loud but still a good crowd there on a Thursday evening.  Great spot, and the beers did not disappoint.  The only downside was that the fireplace upstairs wasn't lit - oh well :P"
Great selection of beer! The lamb sandwich was pretty yummy. Just wish it would say on the menu that it's a cold sandwich. The service was great and the decor was awesome! Will definitely be back here soon :)
"Ah, so this is where my craft coctail journey begins. Let me begin by saying, I'm pretty much a vodka and gin guy. I ordered a crafty from O&E with whiskey. This now reminds me after all these years why I don't drink dark spirits. Soused, oops, I forgot where I'm at, pissed after half a glass..."
"Tuesday nights they have a burger special. My friends and I had regular burger nights in Chicago and our goal was to find the best burger in town. Owen & Engine wins. The quality of the meat is what sets this place apart. No fancy garnishing needed for this fat juicy burger, only a hungry appetite. It may look small from the outside, but dont be fooled. They have an upstairs dining area too!  It's not that loud in there so it's good to go with a group of friends. Like I said, Tuesday nights are their special burger nights. Tip: go across the street to the theatre bc they also have a Tuesday movie special. Think it's like $7 a movie."
"I finally got around to visiting Owen & Engine recently -- what a treat! We loved the English pub ambiance, the menu and, of course, the beer. It was an early weekday dinner, and the mellow vibe was just right for the four of us to enjoy the surroundings, the food and our conversation.As a frog leg devotee, I am delighted to have found the best in town served here as a small plate -- they were fresh, fried crispy outside and tender inside, and service with scrumptious fiddleheads. I will be back for them, if for nothing else! Indian spiced half chicken was another big hit: so tasty, so tender. Fish & chips were exemplary: perfectly cooked, not greasy at all, great flavor and delicious sauces. Even a tiny lettuce salad was outstanding with its roast cipollinis, homemade curds and maple vinaigrette. To wash all this good fare down, there's an admirable beer list, with true British beers on draft. Ahhh, bliss...Nice place, congenial & knowledgeable staff, fine-dining pub fare -- quite a delight! I'll certainly come back (for the frog legs and more)."
"This is one of my favorite bars in the city.   The food, cocktails, ambience, and service are all excellent.    Can be crowded but I've rarely waited long for a table.   Beer and cocktail aficionados will find plenty to be happy about.   And the whiskey selection is smaller than some of the ""whiskey"" bars in the city but still top notch.   A purveyor of good whiskey will always find something to drink."
"I assumed the worst about Owen & Engine. I assumed that since it was across from a multiplex, it'd be on par with most of the mass-market chain restaurants I've seen spring up around movie theaters. But this is a far cry from the soulless, dead food of a TGI Friday's or Bennigan's. It feels wrong even mentioning those rubbish restaurants in the same paragraph as O&E, but that was the misconception I initially held. Of course, that was quickly dispelled once we (my wife and I) went inside.Led by our hostess up an insanely dimly-lit stairway, we soon found ourselves in a beautiful, well-lit lounge. It reminded me so strongly of a place I've been in London, with the the warm, lighter-colored wood of the bar and tables, but mostly the big sofa in the middle of the room. That really pulled it all together and gave it the feel of a true public house. So cozy and homey.Feels good, but how's it taste? Everything on the menu sounded so good, and our server really sold a few things, so we started with the pasty and the taglierini. Both were clearly products of a skilled chef. Tasted nice and fresh, homemade, bursting with flavor. The lamb in the pasty was so tender and juicy. The fresh egg noodles of the taglierini were light but hearty. Those were the so-called small plates, but both were fairly sizeable. Each could be an entree for a skinny person. That said, my wife and I were ready, willing, and able to split an order of fish and chips as a main course, so that's just what we did. Fish batter was nice and light, didn't overpower the delicate flavor of the haddock. Little smear of pea puree tasted like fresh peas. My wife made little squee sounds of joy over the chips and, especially, the malt vinegar aioli. Highly recommended. Can't wait to go back and try the burger. Apparently, it's equal parts ground chuck, brisket, and short rib - damn that sounds good!I'm increasingly difficult to impress as I get older and more cynical, but I gotta say Owen & Engine impressed me. I suppose it helped that they had such a low bar to clear with my floor-level expectations, but from the space to the service to the prices to the food to the beer menu (Belhaven nitro stout!), they really knocked it out of the park."
Tea & scones!! That's all you need. Tea and FRESH scones. This place is amazing. The food is always so delicious. They have a very creative menu & everything (seriously everything) is cooked fresh and perfect. One of the best fish and chips. The service here is great. The girls on the floor when we went were so sweet and accommodating. They kindly closed some windows for me (not sure why the other person wanted them open-it was so hot outside and I was not looking for an allergy attach while waiting for lunch). I'm not a drinker but omg the selection is amazing. The bartender seemed to know about all the liquor they had. My friend was more than happy with the recommendation.  But seriously amazing scones. Fresh cooked so make sure ur ready. Best 25min I've ever spent!!
"I came here on Friday and it was incredibly crowded. We were told that the wait time would be an hour maximum for 3 people but we ended up waiting two hours. We were very frustrated until we were told that our first round of drinks was on the house! The server, Christopher, was lovely. He was very funny, knowledgeable, and incredibly nice. Our food, was also delicious. It was my first time getting the fish and chips here and they are definitely some of the best in the city. Cozy atmosphere, great service, delicious food, and good beer selection....you can't go wrong."
"Everyone here needs to realize that they should take their guard down and understand they are serving burgers and beer. Their 3-flat renovated pre-1900's London house is no excuse for treating people like bags of crap.We went in and yes, the food was decent. 6 minutes after our reservation we were called and reminded that our table was seconds away from being given away - oh, thanks, dude - great to know. We arrived 12 minutes after our reservation and, again, were reminded how lucky we were that he didn't give our table away in the next ""30 seconds.""When we asked for ketchup for a table of four, we were brought a 2oz ramekin -  we asked for another one and the staff talked to us like we were a pain in his ass.We didnt split the check. We paid and tipped in cash. We didn't complain about the shitty host. We didn't complain about our shitty ketchup nazi. We tipped at over 20%. We eat out a lot and always tip well. So when we went upstairs to get a cocktail around the christmas tree up, and were told to get out cause they weren't accepting 'new customers' we about shit our pants.Us: ""We bought dinner downstairs, we aren't new."" Them: ""Um, well, sorry we we aren't bringing in new customers.""Us: ""We are current customers""-a man walks to the bar and orders a beer - Them: ""Um... I dunno, like.. it's based on how busy we are and stuff""If you want to run a bar, run a bar.If you want to house pretentious pricks who make you feel bad aboutventuring to their crappy location to eat, then fine.I liked this place once and have eaten here a dozen times.But this last time was a big fat turd on a silver platter that I was toldI wasn't fit for... so fuck it.I'm not an out of towner. I wasn't in for the 'burger special'. I  didn't ask to split checks. I didn't bitch about anything. I wasn't cheap. I did not request anything off menu and asked (and abided by) the servers reccos. And it turned out to be a big cock slap in the face.Owen & Engine can shove a big fat subpar burger up their chimney;cause there are a million other places to go who will have better foodand people who won't treat you like ass.Go to Au Cheval and the wait is well worth it.Go to Trencherman and enjoy without the flack from entitled asshats.Go go PQM and learn something from the butchers who care about the ingredients and don't just flaunt them to make you feel stupid.Food is food - the people and atmosphere make it all worth the travel and money.This place isn't worth either."
"Great burger and beer selection. But missed out on 5 stars because of a ridiculous ""open food charge"" because someone with a gluten allergy needed to use their own hamburger bun. No advance notice that they would be charged for doing so and they even requested no bun so as not to waste one. So to your extra fee for NOT using a bun - In the words of Seth Meyers and Amy Poehler - REALLY?!?!"
LOVE this place! So worth waiting 45 minutes for during off hours! Delicious cocktails and amazing English gastro pub fare. Love the Bubble and Squeak! Also our waiter was so great. I don't remember his name but he gave great recommendations and was so friendly. Restaurants like this are usually stuffy and unwelcoming but we did not feel that way at Owen + Engine. My friend was on crutches and the staff was extremely accommodating and looking out for her. Very worth the slightly higher prices- their food and cocktails are true works of art as is their beer list.
"This place is always solid and deserves more credit than it gets. It even has amazing hot chocolate !!!! Best I've ever had, served in a beautiful tea service with cinnamon toast, like some kind of dream I had as a kid. Burger special on Tuesdays, same plight as half-price movies. Excellent, frequently changing menu, we've tried everything-- the patsys, bangers and mash, and root veggies are particularly good. I always keep their private-ish room in mind for parties of 8-10 or so. It's a lovely, sequestered table upstairs, facing the front window, and easy to reserve. A few constructive critiques from a big fan -- I wish they had more veggie options; the heavy reliance on meats is authentic to the theme of the restaurant but gets a little lazy, plus I'm a vegetarian now and there's little to mine here anymore. And the cocktails have been disappointing for the price; they just aren't that special and it's difficult to justify having more than o e at premium prices. Short -- very short -- pours of wine too, also $10 or so across the board. Never had much luck drinking here.but overall such a great experience every time."
"For appetizer, I split a scotch egg.  It is amazing and everyone should have it.  The stout mustard that comes with it was great.  One of the best burgers in the city.  I got aged cheddar, but they also had bacon slab and egg as topping choices too ,  They grind the burger mix themselves .  Everything about it astounding.  The London meets and ciders on tap was great touches.  I'll be back guaranteed."
"Did a larger party for brunch with my family for my birthday this year.  The server (I wish I could remember his name....) did a great job explaining the menu, what things were, etc and was very attentive to the table's needs, and even made a special request to the kitchen for my poor cousin who just had her wisdom teeth out.  The food was excellent.  I had the Plowman's Lunch and I wish my arteries could handle that every day.  I think every member of my family walked away satisfied and all mentioned that they would love to come back for dinner."
"So so so so great.My boyfriend and I were going to the movies next door and instead of trekking down to the reliably sub-par Golden Apple, we walked in to O&E. Never one to shy away from dairy, I ordered the cheese plate for myself. It had no description so I didn't have many expectations, but this thing was amazing. Our server described each cheese, roasted nut, pastry, and lemon poached cherry. Not only was each item on the plate exemplary -- no ""throwaway"" crap items to take up space -- it was HUGE and hearty. I'm convinced that if I bought the same stuff from the store it would have cost me twice as much as the plate itself, and it brought me back to when I lived in France, which not many places can say.My boyfriend started with a mustard glaze pretzel with an incredible dipping sauce, which I only got one bite of before he demolished it. He is picky, so this was a good sign. My entree was a split pea soup with roasted chestnuts and hazelnut cream. It wasn't super hot because I was probably nommin' on my cheese for two long, but the flavors and texture of the chestnuts was spot on. My boyfriend got a melt with this amazing beer sourkraut and it was also delicious. Oh, and the fries with malt vinegar aioli? Yeah. Licked that bowl for sure. It is now almost 4 days since I've been to Owen & Engine and my boyfriend has begged me to stop talking about it. The service and food were amazing, though, so we will definitely be back, and we will bring friends. Worth a trip in before a movie or to watch the game!"
"Every dish is finely crafted with an English flair.  Atmosphere, staff, all 5 stars. Try their burgers, if you don't like them you're not real."
"AWESOME place.  Great beer selection, but the food...the FOOD!  Very tight and cozy feel, as this is a popular place and you can tell.  Loved everything I've ever ordered from here.  Mmm scotch egg.  Just go eat here."
I've never had a better burger. It's taken me a year to do the Tuesday night special...and so I had very high expectations. The burger did not fall below my expectations at all. Bravo!!
Love the food here! To top it the waiter was so nice and very helpful.
"Picked O&E as my first Yelp review - went on a Thursday evening with reservations.Our server was named Alex, at least according to the bill. Very friendly dude, and good server. My fiancee ordered a glass of wine, while I ordered an IPA. Alex informed me they were out of the beer I ordered but recommended another that they had on cask - the Arcadia HopMouth Double IPA. It wasn't quite as hoppy as I would expect from a double IPA, which made it even more pleasant - good recommendation based on my tastes.We ordered the mussels and each got the burger, mine medium rare, the girl's, medium.Mussels were goooooood, but the broth - the broth was outstanding. I could've slurped it up with a spoon. Just enough baguette to soak most of it up.The burger was fantastic. I don't know why some reviewers here say this is a bad, greasy burger. Maybe they don't understand each meat O&E puts into their burger. It's impossible for these meats to NOT be a little fatty or greasy - unless you order it hockey-puck charred. Anyways it's high quality meat and the burger was mostly cooked to spec, maybe a tad more medium than medium-rare, but I was certainly not complaining. Got it with the cheddar add-on and the onions that it comes with. Overall, an excellent burger. Fries were very good. The aioli seems to be hit or miss. I loved it while the girl wasn't as big of a fan (which was ok, as I used the rest of hers on my fries).Good experience and meal, will definitely be back."
"We were seeking a place to just stop in and have a bite to eat. What a surprise to find that this little gastropub has the most amazing beers and food that could rival all of the ""big name"" places. The decisions begin as soon as you sit down. What to have to drink. The specialty is beer and they seem to have a brew to satisfy the beer desires of all patrons. I am  not a beer drinker but felt compelled to take a chance on something from their extensive menu or one of their special offerings. Everything sounded so good. Minnie, our server, guided me with a sample of the perfect brew for me -- Chocolate Camaro (who'd think???).Next came the food decisions. Once again it was Minnie to the rescue. She explained what some of the dishes include -- some of the Queen's English we didn't understand was translated to good ole' American English.  We started with ""Pot of Assorted House-Made PICKLES""  They were incredible ... not just your average pickle but a combination of veggies that are pickled in various types of brine. We learned that fruits are included in the pickling process when they are in season and are ready to be served in the fall.My husband had the best burger he has ever had. Lucky me, I got to taste one of his fries, outstanding. I savored the ""SHRIMP SAUSAGE AND GRITS, Mussels, Clams, Stew of Preserved Tomato and Fennel, Shellfish Bisque"" -- oh my gosh. Every bite was incredible. I am not a big eater but ate everything on the plate and wanted to be able to lick it clean -- manners are the only thing that held me back. Our son had Moroccan Spiced CHICKEN, Crushed Olives, Preserved Lemon, Apricot-Almond Cous Cous, Cardamom-Rose Scented Carrots"" and enjoyed every bite. An unusual feature is that the server provided an explanation of the dish when it was brought to the table -- a reminder of all of the elements you are able to eat. Believe me, you will taste each of those elements as the ingredients have their own place in each dish.The cozy feeling of this pub adds to the comfort of the meal. There is a large bar with seating that is a nice alternative to the tables. It was not overly crowded on this weekday evening (~7:00) but I understand they are packed at times. Being across the street from a movie theater, I'm sure they have many patrons after a show. They take reservations and I'd highly recommend them, especially for large groups. owenandengine.com  The theater across the street has a huge parking deck. Parking is just $2.00 and a nice option if you can't find street parking."
"Everything I tasted here was unique and memorable.  Virginia peanuts, roasted bone marrow, P.E.I. mussels, sweet breads and chicken livers were appetizers we tried.  Ok, the mussels I've had similar before, but they were still outstanding.  For dinner, I tried the crispy kale salad and a leek soup, which I no longer see on the menu, which is too bad.  It was an elevated version of french onion soup.I thought I had tried gastropub cuisine, but Owen and Engine is undoubtedly the best I've had.  The decor is like an updated version of old English decor.  A lot of heavy, dark wood and what looked like raised velvet wallpaper.  However, it didn't feel old and stuffy.  I loved it."
"O&E should be visited for the beer over the food.  They have a good burger and some of the best fish and chips in the city, but the other items I've had are boring. Their biggest issue is consistency in food execution which is all over the map, and the service times.  I've eaten here a half dozen times and one time its great the next I can't believe I came back. Until they solve consistency this is a skip before the movies, hit up Fat Willy's instead."
"Get a reservation! Packed on a Tuesday night, but they still have unseated tables reserved. 1 hour+ wait at 8pm.Had the burger, beer, & bourbon special. Fantastic. I will definitely be going back to try the Fish & Chips (they had run out by the time we were seated)."
"The ""chef"" got his panties in a bunch when I requested ketchup for my burger.  It was brought out begrudgingly and the mood soured immediately.  Hey guy, get over yourself.  You're making burgers at 2700 N. Western.  Which is not Bucktown btw.  Lose the tude."
"My wife and I walked into this place and fell in love.  It is gorgeous.  We were seated up stairs.  I felt like entered someones living room in 1910.  The bathrooms are even gorgeous with the black subway tile and octagon flooring.  The wood trim and beautiful wallpaper is what I dream my house to be.But it quickly stopped there.  I know this is nobody's fault but mine.  I forgot my drivers license at home.  However, I did have 2 forms of government issued identification both with my date of birth including an FOID card.  The waitress had to ask her ""boss"" if it is okay I was served.  Nope.  Waitresses boss for some reason felt the need to be overly authoritarian.  Well, that's very cute of you but you're still a 35 year old bartender I don't know why you need to be so rude maybe you hated my profession?  We'll have some appetizers and leave.  Clearly you don't need our money.  The waitress was very sweet and apologetic.  After our cheese plate arrived.  The waitress asked to see my FOID card, I told her to go show it to her ""boss.""  Evidently when the ""boss-tender"" realized we would not be spending the night for dinner.  Everything changes.  The cheese plate was fantastic.  Perhaps one of the best my wife and I ever ate.  The beer list is o-kay.  Not going to blow you away, especially if you're a beer snob.  Wife had the ""MO"" by Maine Beer Company and followed that up with ""Behemoth"" by Three Floyds.I had the ""Double Daisy Cutter"" by Half Acre and also ""Imperial Stout"" from the amazing Smoke Stack Series by Boulevard.  Finished with ""Go to IPA"" by Stone which I only had to just try it because I never had it.For entree's my wife had the Ploughman Lunch.  She enjoyed it. She loved the horseradish that wasn't over powering that was a great pairing with the meats.  Ham was very fresh.  The salted beef tasted like non-crispy bacon.  Which was supposed to taste like corned beef but not really.  Hard boiled eggs were also very good.  I would like to know their secret.  Wife thought the pepper mix was fantastic.I had the Burger.  Amazing patty, juicy, cooked perfect, tasted great.  I believe it was a 50/50 Brisket/Chuck.   Unfortunately, there were not many other condiments to make this burger standout.  Maybe that's the point, I'm not sure .For dessert we had the sticky toffee pudding with date cake along with some mint-basil ice cream.  The ice cream was about a tablespoon of ice cream.  The cake was lacking sweetness and a little boring.  We wish there was more ice cream because that was the true star of dessert.The crowd was...annoying.  For some reason there are children (running around in circles screaming) let into a place that is basically a bar but I couldn't get served with government issued identification? Typical hipsters here.  Which, I still don't get.  Three frat boys walked in with 2 of them with their hats backwards.  Nothing annoys me more than people thinking it's okay to wear hats in a restaurant or inside any building outside of a sports facility. Waitress gave us tasting of 3 beers at the end.  Thanks.Made sure to tip our waitress well.  Felt bad she had such a crappy boss that almost made her lose money.What I would also suggest is get rid of the bar upstairs and add more tables.  Have that strictly for dining.  There is nothing worse than people being loud and standing with their ass in your table space while you're eating dinner.  Also, I felt bad for the waitresses struggling to get around the standing bar people.Besides our unfortunate experience with the identification issue.  I think people are rating this place a little high.  Mediocre beer list that is very minimal.  Along with food that really hasn't not ever been done before.Will we ever go back?  Probably not. Far too many other restaurants to try in Chicago to spend another night here."
If you don't love this place you're nuts.
"This place is gorgeous and oozes pre-colonial class. The decor is reminiscent of those impossibly exclusive old English hunting clubs wear stuffy old men smoked pipes and relived the glory days with one another. However, on a Saturday night Owen & Engine was stuffed with 30-somethings swilling sherry and lounging on expensive leather furniture.The first floor is kitted out as a bistro, complete with mood lighting and dark wood.The second floor was a bar with ample seating and a nice breeze.Very fancy. I felt like I should constantly be ordering something expensive, but the staff was cool with my group of loveable dorks nursing one drink each and playing board games for a couple of hours. Very nice.The wallpaper, just pet the wallpaper. You'll understand."
"Goodness the parking sucks!  However, this is a diamond in the rough.  Very professional staff, attentive bar tenders, and the food is excellent.  This a great place to go on a date, pull your best moves, and well, you just might get lucky. The chicken is amaze balls, a great burger ( one of the best I've had), and you can't go wrong with a scotch egg.  Oh, and please do not forget to enjoy their selection of beer and cocktails.   One last thing, take good care of the staff with a big tip. They earn it here!"
"So my review is really a 1.5 start rating however I had to underrate it because I have never been to a meal where my fiance looks like he is going to cry over his failed entree.  Usually that is my role since I am the foodie in our relationship.  He even said he would have opened up a Yelp account just to rate this place a one..so being his fiance, I'll take one for the team and rate it.In short, this place is really overrated and I fail to understand why it is in such high demand.  There are a few things that went well.Scotch Egg is terrific.  A little overpriced for a scotch egg..but it's still really delicious.Their cheese sauce that comes with the pretzel, well it's sinfully divine.Their cocktail James Reily (I think I have the name wrong but it is the cocktail that is whiskey with ginger beer..I prefer to call it a twist on the Moscow Mule)Bangers and Mash are awesome, they make their own sausage and it is out of this world.However, our experience was overshadowed by the huge mistakes they made.Even though the pretzel sauce was amazing, the pretzel itself was flat and nothing special.It took FOREVER to get our main entrees.  We got our appetizers right away, but that just made the wait for our main entrees all the more longer.My fiance order a filet and he requested it to be medium rare.  When he finally got his filet, it was the height of what a skirt steak usually is (really thin) and his steak was rare.  I ordered the Bangers and Mash and let's be honest, it doesn't take long to prepare sausages that have already been made and cook up a medium rare filet.  The fact that it took so long and both meals were semi cold...that just speaks to poor culinary service and bad timing on the kitchen's part.Our waiter was really cool and I think he felt bad about the filet mess up and he gave us a free dessert which was a brownie with bacon fluff...which in spite of how nice it was, the bacon fluff did not tasted like salt goo and just ruined the brownie.I would suggest coming here for a drink and appetizers if you have time to kill before a movie..but for a nice date dinner...there are way better places elsewhere that actually have food that is worth waiting for."
"We had a group of 9 for a going away party and everything from start to finish was awesome. The bar bites and charcuterie were fantastic. The boys all oohed and ahed over the beers, loving each variety as recommended by our AWESOME (did I say freakin AWESOME) server, Christopher. I loved my Pimm's and all of the other cocktails were a hit. Our table was in a semi-private room on the second floor with just another 2-top (so sorry to those people for our loud group!).All of the couples pretty much ordered and shared the burger and fish and chips. The burger was great, with the meat ground in-house. We did not get the egg on top but those that did said that the egg made it. I really loved the fish and chips. The pea puree on the bottom was perfection. One friend of ours ordered the chicken but asked for the sauce on the side. Our fries dipped in that sauce was freaking life changing. Unfortunately we could not stay for dessert but we will be back!"
"This place has, hands down, one of the best burgers I've ever had.  Everything about it made me want to touch it ever-so-lovingly.  The cheese was excellent cheddar with fairly pronounced calcium crystals *YUM*.  The patty itself was definitely made of quality, semi-fatty meat which lends itself so well to evolving into a sweet juicy burger.  They top it off with caramelized onions,  not just grilled mind you, but thoroughly caramelized.  That venture takes time.  Even the bun was fantastic.  Nice, yeasty, artisanal bread with a bit of tug to it--a hallmark of good bread.  I had beer here and remember that it was good, but it was so hopelessly overshadowed by that celebrity burger that I can't remark any further about the suds."
"We came here last night as one of the last stops on my bachelorette party food and drink tour. Staff were super accommodating to get the eight of us seated, and instead of being outwardly annoyed with eight loud girls, we were treated on the house to a couple of dishes and attentively cared for when we had questions about our drink choices. And oh are there wonderful choices. The Scotch egg was delicious and perfectly runny, the fish and chips were bursting with flavor, and the bone marrow with their accompanying jams was ah-mazing. I also had a new favorite sour beer there - The Bruery's Tart of Darkness. To top that all off, we had left and were across the street when a server came running out with something in her hand. She met us halfway across the street to hand us one of the food and drink ""passports"" that we had been keeping the whole night and someone had left behind. That was such a rad thing to do for us. I'll definitely be back. Thank you, amazing folks of Owen and Engine!!!"
"We were surprised at how tiny the place was.  Very cute though.  We went upstairs and sat in lounge chairs by the fireplace.  Food & beer were very good.  Just super crowded with folks standing all around us.  There were 5 of us, so perhaps we will try again now that we know what to expect.  On a week night it would be very nice and intimate or to go and sit at the bar just the 2 of us.  Fish & Chips and the Short Rib Melt were delicious.  Try their beers and don't forget to read the descriptions.  I appreciate the beer described as tasting like ""wet earth""  :)"
"So, still a 4* because my wife says ""best effin burger in my life"" and the beers great.My ""full English fry up"" missed the mark (and I'm allowed to say that). The bacon was not proper back bacon but normal US crispy thin stuff. Beans were hard. Bread was not fried in bacon fat. The black pudding (blood sausage) was just dry and grainy. The pork sausage tasted good but had a piece of plastic inside. Tomato and egg were fine.But a few weeks ago I had the beef hash which was phenomenal!add: they also comped the meal, so full marks for that."
"I did not expect to be blown away by Owen and Engine and I truly was! Came by for dinner with the boyfriend, Tommy R and Cara S on a Saturday night. We arrived around 7:30 without reservations and were told the wait was an hour, it ended up being a bit more than that. However, with the cozy upstairs bar to enjoy some drinks at, the wait went by quickly. Owen and Engine has an extensive beer list and an interesting cocktail menu. I had the Guy Reily and Old Fashioned, both of which I really enjoyed. After being seated downstairs, our waitress came over and was very friendly and helpful while navigating the menu. One of my dining companions has a serious gluten allergy and our waitress was very accommodating. She had no problem asking the chefs for clarification on what items were actually gluten free. We started with the charcuterie plate which was awesome. Every item was more delicious than the next and all of the flavors played off each other extremely well. Knowing that our GF diner couldn't eat the bread, out waitress brought out a whole order of pork rinds (which were gluten free) to use instead. Very thoughtful of the chef. For dinner, I had the bangers and mash which was incredibly flavorful and hearty. Literally, every bit was full of flavor and I was so full maybe one-third through my meal. I definitely recommend ordering this dish. I tried one of my dining companion's burgers and it was delicious, one of the best I've had in a while. The remaining two at our table ordered the Ploughman's which is like a deconstructed sandwich. All of the items are displayed separately and you can put them together however you'd like. Again, they were very accommodating for our diner with a gluten allergy. Everyone was thrilled with their meals and we were all incredibly full...but not too full to not order dessert. The pumpkin cheesecake was definitely non traditional, it didn't resemble a piece of pie in the least bit, but it was a very tasty dessert. Definitely embodied ""fall"" and included components like candied pepitas that added extra flavor and crunch. Overall, go to Owen and Engine and you will not be disappointed."
"So. The famous burger. BIG disappointment. I am not a big fan of caramelized onions that literally taste like nothing but sugar...  and the burger was very tasteless, despite their use of what I'm assuming is good quality beef. And it came with soggy chips/fries (mustard from the scotch egg was great with the chips though). Most hyped and worst part of the night. Just way too overly heavy.But. Our scotch egg was amazing. I was so embarrassed to be licking tiny crumbs off my fork but it was just so good! And such a small bite to share between 2. Next time I""m getting 2. For myself. We also tried the mole spiced pork rinds... crispy, but not too memorable. Bf sprang for steak HAH. I should have done that. Our server was great, kept an eye on us the entire time, super friendly, and helped me pick a beer to try. I always assumed I didn't like the taste beer because I never had any good ones, and so I needed help picking. He recommended a cider that had some fruitiness (which I said I liked), and I have to say, it was the least bad beer I've ever had. Guess it's just an acquired taste... It was something refreshing to wash down the heavy food though.I am all for homey pub ""rustic"" food, simple but done well. This I ust think was way too heavy and greasy. I would personally need a little bit of *something* to offset the heaviness. A little bit of balance in every dish....That said, I do love the environment... While I don't think I'll come here for a dinner meal again, I would love to return for small plates before/after a movie across the street or something."
"Amazing cocktails, everything about this destination is incredible. The atmospher can compete with any restaurant in Chicago, and the food is a classic ENGLISH fare.   This is a goto place after a movie across the street. Cocktails and a good film... is there anything better?"
"Staff takes their time but the food and the drinks more than make up for it. Fantastic seasonal selection of drinks and eats, tons of creativity and amazing flavors. And... OMG the pork rinds."
"So I checked out the $15 beer/bourbon/burger special. I have to say I was impressed. The burger was plane yet delicious with all the fix-ins perfectly complimenting the patty. The bourbon and beer are on rotation every week but they all seem to be craft or microbrews as opposed to other places that include ""Bud Lights"" in their special. Now Logan Square is becoming the place to be for the beer/shot and burger combo but what I can say about Owen and Engine is the food is truly delicious and the staff is amazing. Despite it being one of their high volume nights (special, duh), our waitress was courteous and attentive and never once tried to rush us out. Rather she stopped to make chit chat.I think that everyone out to check this place out and if you can do so on a Tuesday, even better."
"One of my top two bars in all of chicago. The food here is excellent and the cocktails they serve up rival some of the top spots in town. They also bring in some truly special beers, and they are always changing up their menu selection. Service is usually top notch; the bartenders are very knowledgeable and friendly. For food, fish and chips all the way. They also make a mean Scotch egg. For drink, the menu is ever changing, but for winter 2013, I'd go with the Redhead cocktail."
I can't believe I'm just finding out about Owen & Engine! Decided to stop there before a movie and was so pleasantly surprised.Decor and atmosphere was cozy - embraced the Brit feel without being in your face.Food - holy shit! Everything made fresh and the staff really takes pride in their food and ingredients. Tuesday night was a special - $14 burger but for $15 you also got a beer (IPA) and a shot (bourbon). Amazing deal! Burger was so delicious. amazing chips with garlic aioli and ask for their housemade ketchup. Probably some of the best I've had. A friend tried the freshmade breads and the rhubarb spread was craveable.Service - Extremely accommodating for our large group. Got 10 of us in and out in less than an hour so we could catch our movie. I will definitely be back!
"Visited Owen & Engine on a cold Thursday night and felt the warmth of an English Pug as soon as we walked in. The  charcuterie was a great starter and item to share, especially with a beer from a very solid and diverse draft beer list. After reviewing  the very creative men I settled on a traditional burger, it was outstanding. One of my guest went for the Moroccan Spiced Chicken, he offered a taste I will order it the next time we visit. The service was very good. As far as corner taverns go for drinl and food  O&E is better than most."
"Owen & Engine is one of those places that I can hang out in repeatedly.  Just a good feeling.  The staff are friendly and very helpful.  Great service all around.  It is supposed to be like an old style english pub and I enjoy what they have done with the place.  Notable offerings are the burger which must be of course accompanied by a runny egg and two big thick slabs of bacon which overall combination is yummy harmonious.  Also, being in an old english style pub, one must try the Scotch Egg which is delicious.Love this place."
I have been to Owen & Engine both times I've visited Chicago. I returned for the burger and was not disappointed the second time around. This is my favorite burger ever -- and I've had my fare share of burgers. It is juicy and delicious and I want one right now. I also love the atmosphere here. I really don't understand why anyone would give Owen & Engine anything less than a 5 star rating.
Good looking cocktail and beer selection. The food is amazing and the service is great. The space is cozy but the amount of people in here make it a little too cozy. If you get lucky enough to go upstairs you'll get to enjoy the beautiful big wood & brass bar next to the fire place.  As far as food I've ordered 7 different big plates and all have been delicious.  Have the burger even if you don't add all the fixins it's the best patty of happiness and joy you'll taste! The menu changes as they offer seasonal and many house made selections.
"Pretty Delicious, the dishes were daring and interesting but I wont say ill become a regular.  Worth the visit and a nice way to mix up my typical chicago restaurants."
"Went here with a group for their Tuesday burger/beer/whiskey special. The burger was very, very good (possibly best I've had in Chicago) service was fantastic, and their upstairs lounge was a great place to hang out. Exceeded my expectations."
Simply amazing.  The Saganaugh (sp?) Inn cocktail was sublime.  The burger is hand ground. The bun hand baked.  The whole meal was exceptional.  Will be back!!
"My friend RAVED about this place (mostly their burgers), so we had to try it out. The atmosphere is like an English pub - something a little different! We came here for lunch, so we didn't really drink. However, I hear that they have some good drafts. I did get coffee, and I was really impressed that it came french-press style. NICE. They have a nice menu selection, but we knew right when we came in that we were getting burgers. They are simple - they come with caramelized onions and a burger and bun. The end. You can substitute or add a very few things, like cheese. I don't like onions so I just got cheese. It was a tasty burger! It was cooked just right, juicy, and seasoned well. I wasn't a fan of the fact that the bun gets a little soggy (I hate soggy bread). It also came with fries, they were very good as well. It was a very filling meal!Our server was very nice and attentive. She visited our table a number of times, refilled our waters frequently, and didn't even need to write our order down. I was impressed! i wouldn't definitely recommend this restaurant, and would come back!"
"My initial review is 3.5, but I only had lunch.  Actually, I set out for brunch on a Saturday morning only to find out that they only do brunch on Sunday.  Huge bummer.  I was really excited for their brunch menu.  The ambiance is great, the bar is beautifully done, and their take on a 'Red Snapper' is pretty tasty....savory, balanced, and nice presentation.  I had the Indian Pub Curry, which is served with either white or dark meat chicken (I opted for white) and basmati rice.  This was really well done....chicken was cooked perfectly (not dry, well seasoned) and the curry flavor was fantastic.  My BF had the open face french toast sandwich topped with ham, cheese and an egg.  It's served with jam and maple syrup--hint: ask for the syrup on the side.  The sandwich is really rich...tasty, but really rich. He enjoyed it but it's not something I could have eaten by myself.  Although the food was tasty it took a really long time. I believe we waited nearly 40 minutes for our meal, which was surprising since we were one of two tables in the restaurant.  So, if you're looking for a 'quick' bite, might not be the best choice.  I'll probably go back to check out their bar scene, and maybe brunch."
"Saturday Night August 30th, We were down in the Logan Square neighborhood for our first outing to the roller derby.  We decided to try a local restaurant and chose Owen & Engine.  Wasn't sure about the menu but decided to give it a try!  We started with the seasoned peanuts for an appetizer and were pleasantly surprised.  I had the Eggplant Sandwich which was delicious, the mixture of flavors were amazing.  They were served with fries and a dipping sauce of lemony mayo.  My husband had the rib-eye steak which was cooked to order and served with delicious seasoned grilled veggies.  We sat outside upstairs and enjoyed the warm night and the sunset!Give this British place a try!  Very good!"
"I am pleased to report that all of the stars were in alignment for what proved to be a pleasant solo dining experience here. I may never be able to eat a hamburger anywhere else.Talk about scrumptious. With perfect ambiance and service,  too.I had only been to Owen & Engine for a private birthday celebration prior to this visit. That was in the upstairs bar-a place which feels more like a private parlor in an imaginary rich friend's house. The wood, the seating area with sofas, the fireplace. Well, the birthday bash was a big success . Staff were more than welcoming and helpful. The finger food was was excellent, and so were the drinks. I confess to be an unapologetic abuser of the open bar.On my recent visit, I came specifically for their $15.00 Tuesday bar special which includes a house burger, fries, a black Scottish Ale and a shot of Bourbon.  It was fairly early, maybe 6:30 PM.  The downstairs bar was full, so I was sent upstairs. The bar there was empty, but not for long. There were a few parties seated at the windows and by the roaring fire. The bartender was all mine for awhile, so I asked as many questions as I could. Such as ""Why is this freakin"" burger so good?""Their burger is nothing short of perfection, and probably because it is made with 40% ground chuck, and the remaining portion is a mix of short rib meat and brisket. It makes for a rich, juicy and fresh combination. My first bite elicited some noise not unlike Meg Ryan's in that diner scene of ""When Harry Met Sally."" I opted for English Cheddar ($2.00 more) and put only mustard on top of the carmelized onions. I have to admit I was just a bit intimidated by the lack of presence (or offer) of catsup, fearing some private cultural humiliation, I passed on that. But later I found it was available. But neither the burger nor the fries needed any enhancements.  The fries, or ""chips"" were in fact some of the best I've had. What I really like about the burger was the B to B or burger to bun ratio. I like my burger to hang over the side of the bun. No bedonka-donk buns with my burgers.. I want a burger with love handles- like the ones I get from eating them. The Owen and Engine buns are light and just the right size, and perfect companions to a half-pound medium rare burger.The service with Upstairs Daniel was excellent. He made the entire evening feel as if it were a private party. He went way out of his way to accommodate a chap next to me at the bar who had an onion/garlic./leek intolerance or allergy. He worked with the chef to make sure this guy got something tasty but not harmful to his delicate condition. Daniel also gave us all great information on all of the food and drink here. Not just a bartender-he's also  a fan.Menu items are always changing, and exciting things like duck with sag paneer and curry sauce simply jump off the page. Prices are reasonable and the burger/ale/shot deal is really a good value. Great place to hang out on your own to drink and eat, or come with a group for a birthday or an unbirthday. So I'll see you sometime this winter around the cozy fire, OK?."
"Ask for Kip as your server! Hands down one of the best gentlemen in Chicago. He won't settle until your time at O&E is completely satisfying, through and through. He noticed in passing that my burger (which is supreme) wasn't quite cooked to perfection, took it back to the kitchen, and brought out a new one. The attention and knowledge of 5 star service, truly."
Very helpful service. Food always comes out at appropriate timings. Big portions leave you satisfied. Best restaurant for miles. Sit upstairs and drink your beer slowly; you may just forget that you're in the city.
"Best burger I've ever had. One bite will bring on weeping and gastronomic ecstasy.   Beautiful place, nice people, great beer, booze, and cocktails."
"My fiance and I went here last night, on a Tuesday to enjoy their Burger, Beer and Bourbon for $16 special. We have lived in the neighborhood and driven by this place for three years and finally got the chance to go in. We drove over and parked in the theater parking lot for a flat rate of $2. It was about 6:45-7 pm, we walked right in and were seated right away- there were only two of us. Soon after, a line started to form. The waiter knew right away we were there to take advantage of the special so we ordered soon after sitting. The beer and bourbon are pre-selected for you and the burger comes plain (with caramelized onions) and the choice of cheese, bacon and/or egg add ons. I got all three options for add ons, and don't regret it. The beer was delicious and it was fun to try something new,  I know I wouldn't normally order. I am not a huge bourbon fan, but it was part of the deal so I tried it- and my fiance drank the rest. We enjoyed our meals for sure, the burgers come with some fries and aioli sauce on the side. The food is really very good (and pretty greasy), however we were disappointed when our bill came to find out our add ons for our burgers were almost as much as the special, so our bill still came out to be about $55 for two of us- so that's where they get you! It was a fun experience and if you like fancy burgers, craft beers and an old Englishman ambiance, Owen & Engine will provide that for you. Overall we had a good time and would probably go back but it wasn't the best dinner I've ever had for $55."
"The first thing you should do when you sit down is order a scotch egg. It does not matter if you had a scotch egg before or not, you should still try Owen & Engine's. For me, scotch eggs were alright...but then I tried O&E's and it was ridiculously good! A soft-boiled egg with a thin crispy crust. The stout mustard that came with it paired so well with the scotch egg. It was my best experience with scotch eggs!The crispy kale salad was pretty awesome. The crispy kale and the roasted Brussels sprouts really made the salad stand out. Let me explain what a cornish pasty is; it is a giant English empanada. I never saw the appeal of fish and chips but I was willing to try it here because everything had tasted so good already. It was not disappointing at all. The fries were pretty good and the fish was crispy. Thanks to O&E, I no longer think British food is bad!"
Finally someone in the states has nailed the British version of fish & chips! Thank you to the chefs at Owen & Engine for making the most delicious fish I've had since Wales... The demi sec cider is also amazing. :-)
"I lived in England for 5 years and this is a better Real Ale pub than many in the UK. Very well kept casks. And they removed the spirtlers from their engines...which many top pubs do not do.  I had the pickles (which were amazing - well worth $8) and the Scotch egg (runny, but the sausage sort of ""meh"")."
"Really a fan of this place.  A) It feels like you're in the living room of someone's beautiful, yet cozy Montana lodge.  B) Service extremely friendly and accommodating to the annoying needs of a large group.C) Food is delicious!  Great portions and affordable pricing.  We had the pretzel, a scotch egg (do NOT come here and not get a scotch egg.  It is WRONG), the bone marrow, the sweetbreads, and a side of bubble and squeak.  And a pot of hot chocolate.  Perfect!  Everything was flavorful and prepared excellent.  Bone marrow was buttery, sweetbreads were tender and perfect.  One of my favorite parts of the meal was the cinnamon toast that came with the pot of hot chocolate.  This is how to do cinnamon toast, my friends.Anyway, we all left full and happy with about 10/person paid.  Which means extra happy!  Great restaurant."
The White Walker cocktail here is magical. Follow that up with a few pints and once you are feeling floaty get the scotch egg and some fries. Drink a few more pints then head across the street and catch a movie. Just about everything I've tried here has been great. The bartenders are pros and the atmosphere is top notch. It can get pricey but for what you get it's worth it.
"My girlfriend and I just walked in off the street  expecting a decent pub but we were AMAZED by the food, service and drinks! We had an excellent time! Try the mussels!"
"This is a great little English pub.  The space is pretty small so seating is limited, but I have been lucky not to wait too long for a table.  They have a great beer selection that are offered at a good price.  I also started drinking scotch, so not sure what a good scotch selection would look like; but I have to say, the 2 glasses of scotch I got were really good and made me want to delve more into the scotch world. People have told me that the burger here is amazing; however, I found mine to be over salty.   I would like to think that it mine was just done wrong at the time, since everyone else has loved theirs. Their gyro, which was much more upscale  than the drive-through version, was good but nothing fantastic.   The Ploughman was a make your own sandwich plate and I really liked it.  I recommend this. Bone Marrow appetizer  was really unique and I thoroughly enjoyed it. The staff is also really nice and knowledgeable.  I definitely recommend this place!"
"they had a damn good hamburger and fries, the patty was big, juicy and one of the better ones i had, solid beer selection, went with one called gatecrasher, and for apps we got frog legs and bone marrow, both of which were pretty small, though i suppose that's how they're served, they were a bit pricy, the legs tasted like chicken wings but with more bones, and the marrow tasted like fat, but the burger was worth the time and money"
"Came here Friday night for my fiancé's birthday with our friends who love this place. We did have a reservation, so I'm not sure how hard it is to be seated without on. We sat upstairs which was super cozy with a fireplace.  Our server was incredibly helpful throughout the whole meal.  We started with the pickles, which were really good. They didn't taste too much of vinegar and there were tons of different veggies to choose from.  Plenty for 4 people, maybe even for 5 or 6. Also had the stuffed calamari, which was tender and tasty with a lamb stuffing and an awesome romesco sauce.The highlight of our starters was the bone marrow, which featured 6 breaded escargot.  This dish came with 2 large slices of toasted buttered bread.  I never had bone marrow, but wow was this good.  For entrees, we ordered the fish and chips and the bangers and mash.I got the bangers and mash which was out of this world delicious.  Two nice size, perfectly cooked and extremely flavorful sausages.  You can tell these guys are house made.  The mash was awesome, creamy with a ton of flavor and smothered in a delicious onion gravy to tie everything together. I could barely finish half this dish, but it was amazing the next day as leftovers. This fish and chips was also really good.  I only had a taste but it was fresh, crisp but not overly greasy.  They fly their haddock in everyday so it's top quality fish.  The chips were also really good.  No one at our table could finish their meals.  Although several amazing and giant pints is probably to blame.Their beer selection is great, so definitely explore the menu but be careful not to over drink, these are traditional 20 oz pints so the alcohol will definitely sneak up on you.  Something we were joking over with our server.We had an awesome meal and I look forward to coming back the next time I'm in Chicago."
"I love O&E - I think the neighborhood really needed a place just like this. I love the ambiance and the servers and bartenders are always knowledgeable and friendly. The beer menu is top notch. I think the food is a tad over-priced, but I'm kind of cheap in that regard. I could eat the pretzel everyday of my life and never tire of it. The peanuts, pickles, and olives are also outstanding. I mostly go to O&E for snacks and drinks but I hear the fish and chips are not to be missed and I'll definitely be back for the burger. The bar area tends to get crowded but the upstairs bar is generally open for overflow and it's a bit more chill up there. O&E is definitely one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood."
"We sat upstairs and it felt like we were in a pub in London. The important difference, the food here is great while pub food in London is not usually a pretty thing. I had one of the best burgers I ever had. I don't eat bread, I am GF, so the burger has to be a great blend of great meats. And theirs is. I can't eat the Fish and Chips, but others had it and said it was like being in England. The beers are really goods, service great.Put on your list of gastropubs"
Delicious delicious delicious food!! I loved it and it's right in front of the movie theater which is extremely convenient. Eat great food before watching a movie rather than getting hoed for a popcorn and a drink at the movie theater for $20.00
"O(wen) so handsome.I can't remember the last time such solid food came together with an equally impressive cocktail/beer/wine list. Add to that well-bred service and the deliciously dark stylings of a British pub and suddenly, there's no where I'd rather be. Add to that the person you'd rather not be without, and you'd have one hell of a fantastic date spot (bookmark... now).Anyway. Settle in, get cozy and start with the oysters, a plate of housemade charcuterie, the pork bangers and mash and if nothing else, DO NOT leave without trying the fish and chips. Over the years, I've put fish and chips on the back burner due to all those good Catholic Fridays (you would too after eating oily, deep-fried fish at your church's pedestrian fish fry or diving uncouthly deeper into the most unrefined sector of fast food: Long John Silver's). But I digress - these golden-hued filets of haddock were fried in the lightest of batter. The accompanying malt vinegar aioli? Housemade. Everything, from sausage to chantilly cream, is housemade. I ventured upstairs to take a call and instantly fell for the upstairs bar - it's a bit ostentatious in that Oxford University type of way (definitely rich and marginally pompous) but somehow it's still warm. Give me a book and a quadrupel Belgian and we'll make an entire day of it, okay?Speaking of Belgians, my only real gripe is that this portion of the beer menu is a bit too boastful. With a starting price of $9 going all the way up to $30, the average price for one of these beauties is about $14. Accessibility is attractive, yes? And it took three tries before landing on a beer actually in stock.... but because I already like you so much Owen, we'll give this another go."
"Update on the salt beef hash and benedict -- *cue all the angels singing*The benedict was not so-good-I-could-cry, but it was done well and properly. And it was damn tasty. The plus of ordering both is that you can eat some salt beef hash with your benedict and make it even better."
"So, a timeline:7PM- have a snack, because we have a late reservation at a place my fiance is surprising me with, but not enough to fill up. Perfect!8:30PM-Walk in the door of the mystery place. It's Owen & Engine, and I'm told it has Bib Gourmand status. Score!8:37PM- Seated at table.8:45PM- Waiter acknowledges us for the first time, takes our drink order.8:55PM- Waiter returns to take dinner orders, I think the drinks made it out sometime in between. We order wings to start, fiance orders chicken thigh sandwich, I order the burger. Fiance had originally wanted fish and chips, but they were 86'ed.9:15PM- Wings arrive. There's 4 and they're dry, but we have entrees coming, so I'm not too concerned. I left most of one wing uneaten, just want my food.9:25PM- Wings are removed from table. 9:30PM- ""I hope the food comes soon... I'm kind of starving now."" I've stopped having conversation with my fiance. My stomach is pretty much seizing with hunger. My 7PM snack of cheese and crackers is pretty much spent, and the last time I ate before that was noon, because my day at work was insane and there was no time to eat.9:40PM- ""Can we just pay for what we've eaten and get out of here? It doesn't take this long for a burger."" Hipster chick at next table rolls her eyes at me, but she and her companion sat down 20 minutes after us, and have been served 3 small plates in this time, so she can shove it. Also, I've been sipping one beer for nearly an hour, it's not even gone, and I feel tipsy.9:45PM- Food arrives.  Waitress serving it details all the things in it. Great, I don't care, let me eat. I'm at the point where you're so hungry you're sick. I tell my fiance this.9:46PM- Waiter who has been dealing with us all night walks over and spends three whole minutes talking to fiance about his sandwich, how to squeeze it down to fit in his mouth, etc. Eat a couple fries, but don't start eating, because the dude won't leave. They're kind of cold, but whatever.9:49PM- Cut burger. I cut a half, then cut one half in half again to make fourths. Hand one-fourth to fiance.9:50PM- Take bite of burger. HOLY MOTHER OF GOD, the fricking burger is COLD. I waited an hour and 20 minutes for this? I tell fiance, he's begun to eat the fourth and agrees it's cold. I encourage him to take a bite of cold fry. He does. Confirms it's cold, but says his are piping hot.9:55PM-Flag waiter over. One-fourth eaten by fiance, my quarter on my plate with one bite taken. Essentially 3/4 of burger remains. ""Oh my gosh, I didn't realize! You should have communicated to me earlier!"" Not sure if he thinks I'm scamming them or something...  Really?! When?!  Last time you were over here I hadn't taken a bite and you were standing here talking and preventing me from eating.  I send the burger back. I'm on the verge of tears. I just want food, the food I've gotten is bad and cold, and I just want to leave. They take my plate. We sit for another couple minutes as the fiance fills up on minimal food, as he was also past the point of hungry from sitting too long.9:58PM- Manager comes over, says he's heard there was a problem. We tell him we waited an hour and 20 minutes, my food was cold (fiance notes his was excellent and piping hot), he apologizes and we ask for the check. Manager asks if I'd like my burger in a box. I say no thank you. I don't want to look at that burger ever again.10PM- Check is brought by both manager and waiter. They've taken the burger off, apologize again and tell us to come back for a better experience next time, because, ""This is not at all how we serve our customers,"" we pay and leave.11PM- Domino's pizza arrives, and I finally get to freaking eat.I'm seriously baffled by the experience we had. There's pacing, and whatever this was. This wasn't even close to Bib Gourmand service, and I'm so angry to have wasted so much time here. Everyone around us seemed to be having a perfectly paced meal. Hipster chick next to us was in after us and out before us with about 4 small plates (all hot). I have an inkling they had our meal sitting, someone took my fiance's sandwich to another table, and they tried to cover up by making him a new one on the fly, and served me a cold burger. But it doesn't take an hour and 20 minutes to serve a sandwich. And based on the time we ordered, it was an hour, and an hour isn't even a permissible wait for a freaking sandwich, so this was not ok by any stretch.And in case anyone, including management, is wondering when the last time I sent back an entree was... it was 2010 at Norma's at the Le Parker Meridien Hotel in NYC. I cut into my $25 crepe and sugar water from canned strawberries oozed everywhere.  So yeah, I don't do it often, and I feel completely justified in sending both the crepe at Norma's and the cold burger at Owen & Engine back. I'm not a fussy customer. Owen & Engine managed to completely ruin my dining experience with slow service and cold food."
"I can't believe we waited so long to try this place in our hood. We don't really go for fancy-schmancy pubs, and though that's what it would be.  Definitely not. While the food is great quality and there are some menu items too adventurous for me, the host was wearing an awesome taco shirt. Need I say more? We had the burger, chicken, pretzel, pickles and mashed potatoes - all were outstanding. Great beer and cider list and we'll definitely be back."
"A timeline:6:45: Show up late, meet friend upstairs by fireplace. 6:50: Drink orders taken, service is great. 6:55: Waitress takes order. We order one app to split and an entree each.7:05: Pasty on our table. Easy to split between four. I like the addition of the arugula salad to balance out the meat and pastry.  7:15: Our waitress notices when a drink needs to be refreshed asap. We never wait more than five minutes before she asks if we need a new drink. 8:00: We have plenty of beer but still no entrees, what is the deal?8:01: GM ""Our computer system screwed up and the kitchen didn't have your order this whole time. You can have any apps you want and your next round is on us.""8:03: We order three apps because no one can decide and some people have dietary restrictions.8:15: I've been here for an hour and a half and I've had four apps and am no longer interested in the entree. The pretzel is good but messy. The mussels are good but not personally for me, I would prefer them without bacon. 8:30: Entrees show up finally. Good thing I only got the crispy kale salad which is a light dish (and is awesome by the way.) Not waiting an hour and 45 minutes for it awesome though. I pick at it because I was completely full after four appetizers. I also ate a few of my husband's fries, sososososososos good. 9:15: We get the final check back and go home. I am sure this was a fluke. Food was pretty good, beer list caught my interest. We sat upstairs at the fireplace and that portion of the bar reminded me of Louis Winthorpe's gentlemen's club. The food was good, hoping to go back when they don't lose our food order. They handled it in the right way, I must say."
"I've eaten almost everything on the menu here.  I can't think of a single item that didn't  match or exceed my  expectations.   When talking to the waitstaff,  they are very familiar with the food & ingredients.   Ask them about a wine or beer pairing and they have great suggestions.   Check out the upstairs and outside deck in the summer time."
"The youngish lad in his mid-30s with the nice glasses, silver hair, and plaid shirt was pleasantly amusing, engaging, and knowledgeable.  Whatever you do, don't Google anything, especially bubble and squeak! He loves explaining stuff like that. He's willing to eat or drink anything you don't like, which in the end doesn't matter because everything is fucking fantastic. Cheers!"
"Owen & Engine is by far my FAVORITE place for a burger. Definitely the best I have had in Chicago. I recommend the burger with a fried egg on top- you can go all out with the bacon and cheese, but it really isn't necessary because it is so good plain. The fries come with a malt vinegar aioli and if you ask, they can even bring a spicy ketchup (which is super yummy too). I have also had the fish & chips, which are fabulous as well.It is conveniently located across from the Regal Cinemas and is a great place to chill on a cold night- makes you feel like you are in a pub in London. My only gripe is that the wait tends to be a little long in the evenings and they don't really have a good bar standing area (you feel like you are standing over people at tables as they eat)."
"The British Pub atmosphere is quaint and unique. The service is friendly, food is tasty, and the draft beers are special, too. Give it a try."
"Owen &  Engine has made it easy to judge weather a ""Chicago's Best Burger"" list is worth reading. If they're not rated #1, don't trust that critic. I've seen so many lists that put Kuma's on a pedestal. Owen & Engine blows any Kuma burger away. Even Au Cheval, which I'd been told was a serious competitor, was good but couldn't compare.In my opinion, there are toppings driven burgers and meat driven burgers. Take the toppings off of most burgers and they'd disappoint. Owen and Engine's burger is phenomenal as it is served with only caramelized onions on top. Add cheese, bacon, or an egg and it is still amazing.Putting the fact that they have the best burger in Chicago (so far) aside... everything else is great too! The rest of the menu is amazing. If the bone marrow is in season, get it! The fish and chips are good, the steak is good, even the fries are original and amazing. The bar is great too. I originally came to Owen & Engine because it is the only place in Chicago (I've found) that serves Old Speckled Hen on tap. Even when they aren't serving this, I can always find a great replacement or Daniel, the upstairs bartender, always has a great one to recommend.The service and ambiance are great. Tuesday's they have a Burger, Bourbon, and Beer special which coincides with the movie theater next door's Matinee-All-Day special. This makes for a perfect date night. (Though I would suggest an exciting movie because we often leave stuffed, satisfied, and ready for a nap)."
"This review is for Owen and Engine's Tuesday burger night.  My friend says the chef packs the burger full of 40% chuck, 30% shortrib and 30% brisket, with a target ratio of 65% lean to 35% fat.  However the chef is also known to hold up raw burger and admit with a smile, ""That's about fifty fifty.""  I know for sure the hamburger I got was packed with the intensity of a Wisconsin butter burger and I loved it."
Upgrading review as consistently great!  Best burger and amazingly good brunch!  Service is top notch as well always!
"I never liked British Gastro pub food until I experienced Owen & Engine.  My boyfriend and I liked this place so much, we came for Lunch, Brunch, and Dinner, three days in a row.  The fact that I live around the corner from this restaurant makes me deliriously happy, as they are open for lunch as well as dinner and brunch (Score!!...that in love).  Perfect date night= Owen &Engine, followed by a movie across the street.  Based on all the hype we ordered a scotch egg to split, well let me tell you, we've ordered this every time since.  I do not like deep fried anything, but the coating on this dish is so light that it just adds a perfect little crunch to the sausage enveloping the egg, which by the way is light and flavorful, with a perfectly runny egg inside...  ermahgerd this is orgasmic. Next we split the kale salad and bubble & squeak.  The salad had so much going on between the Brussel sprouts, edamame, beats, and tons of other ingredients, that I felt utterly satisfied bypassing the meat options.  The bubble dish.....oh my, first of all huge portion, cooked in enough butter, to make a butter loving girl like me watch her portion.  The mashed potatoes are mixed with fried onion and sautéed root vegetables.  Delicious? Yes!  The boy and I couldn't finish it due to the richness.  Next up was brunch and after getting a scotch egg each, we split the Full English Fry Up.  This was the only dish I would not order again.  The brown bread was dripping lard and the sausage felt heavy, the egg excessive to all this richness, and the sweet beans and poached egg didn't make up for it.  Blood Sausage was amazing!!!!  Now, dinner.  Slagel Farm Beef Burger was the best burger I have had in the Logan Square neighborhood, or maybe all Chicago.  No exaggeration, Kuma's corner might boast fun and tasty toppings (which I love), but the taste of the burger itself is hands down better at Owen & Engine."
3 letters word : OMG.It has been 2 years now that I ate a burger there and I'm still thinking about it every single day.I'll be back for sure.
"My most recent visit to Owen and Engine was graced by tasty old fashioneds and the half chicken with grits and veggies. I cannot remember another restaurant where I ordered chicken and it tasted as good as it did at Owen. It was the juiciest, most flavorful chicken I've eaten in a long time. A forkful of chicken, drag it around in the savory gravy then devour. Repeat! And repeat and repeat! It was absolutely delicious and a perfect dish to split with a hungry guy as the grits helped fill your belly rather quickly. Man, those grits! And the veggies created a perfect little cushion for that tasty bird. The only unfortunate bite consisted of the heirloom tomatoes. I popped one in my mouth and it didn't vibe well with everything else. The acidity was a bit too overpowering.  But don't let those guys deter you from ordering this dish. I honestly can't wait to order it again. That chicken was perfecto!"
"Came back with some friends and tried some other dishes.  This place is solid in all aspects.  Accomodated our group of 8 and the service was excellent!  We tried a variety of their dishes and was happy with them all.  They even brought out the steak to show the table before the cut it up for us in the kitchen!  Presentation and attitude towards their food was very respectable.  And again, the bone marrow....  my God so good."
"My husband wanted to do a pub dinner for our first wedding anniversary and we were very happy to try Owen & Engine. They did not disappoint!We arrived a little earlier than our reservation, and they were able to seat us right away. We ordered beer and some appetizers (the scotch egg for him, the soft pretzel and rarebit for me), and whoa...everything was delicious! Our waiter was nice and funny and wasn't intrusive. We ordered our dinner and both were VERY delicious. Husband went for the Fish and Chips and I got the burger with bacon and cheddar added. The fish and chips were the best I've ever tasted (and I love fish and chips!) and the burger was among the best I'd had. My only complaint is that I'd asked for my burger to be medium well, but it was still very pink. Next time I'll order it well just to be sure.After all of that food (and two very heavy beers), we really wanted dessert, but there wasn't much room. We ordered the apple cake with celery root ice cream and it was the perfect amount of sweetness to finish off the meal. The best part was that the hostess wished us a happy anniversary on the way out! It was a nice touch!Thanks Owen & Engine for a lovely first anniversary!"
Magically crafted cocktails paired with an unforgettable British style dessert made for an excellent experience here. We ordered the Rhubarb Trifle which was surprisingly delicious!  Who knew celery pastry cream paired with lemon cake and rhubarb bits could taste so divine?!  Service was on par. Definitely coming back for the pub grub.
"Food was good.  My dining companion felt that the price was too high for what was offered.  Also, it took quite a long time to get our drinks and there was an obnoxious bachelorette party sitting next to us that was extremely loud."
"I really enjoyed Owen & Engine.  Good wine list, interesting cocktails, and a great atmosphere.  I can see it being a tad busy for dinner, but we lucked out and scored a table for about 7 on a Friday night.  They had run out of the pretzel, which was disappointing, but the drinks were good, smoked olives were interesting, and it was an all around good stop in for a quick visit.Atmosphere - 5Food - (only apps, but 4)Value - 3Bathrooms - 5Service - 4"
Awesome. Amazing. The food the drinks and the atmosphere all are great. Came here with a large group of friends and everyone was pleased!! The staff was friendly and made great recommendations for food and drinks. I will definitely be back!!
Damn SERIOUSLY best customer service in the Chi these fools have the best food too man I love this place
"After jumping off of a plane from Detroit, I was starving. I attempted to go to Longman & Eagle but as always it was too damn crowded.I new I wanted some good food and I wanted it soon. I remembered some buddies of mine on separate occasions telling me about this place ever since it opened.I luckily got a parking space on Western right in front which I saw as a win. I walked in and was greeted by the nice staff and since I was alone I told them I would grab a seat at the bar.As I said in the beginning, I was starving and desperately needed food. I didn't want to go with steak or anything huge, but something that would hit the spot and not overstuff me. I decided on the scotch egg and the english peas risotto. The scotch egg was delicious as it came with stout mustard...it was sooo good that I devoured it as soon as it was placed in front of me. The risotto included asparagus, mushrooms, mint, fresh parmesan & green pesto. I actually took my time on this as I wanted to savor every bite. I was thirsty so I went with the Coup De' Taut which was delicious as well. The staff was awesome as they were having a bit of trivia on movies (it wasn't too crowded/wed nite). They made sure I enjoyed my first time @ Owen & Engine and that my food was great. Def a place I would like to return to especially on Tues nights as they have burger, bourbon & beer nights for $15. Awesome beer list is another good reason to return...draft & bottles."
"So my friend, being the drunkard he is, asks the bartender what the strongest beer they have is.  Out came the 10.3% alcohol Sam Adam's Imperial White and it was some awesome fresh tasting beer.  I've picked up a few bottles since then, but it's just not the same as the beer from their special engine taps.  They have a nice menu of beer on tap, as well as a list of bottled beers.There's table seating downstairs with a bar and there's another bar upstairs, surrounded by comfy leather couches and a fireplace.  Also, the 2nd floor outdoor patio is a nice chill spot, but it sucks that it has to close at 10pm.  Service was really slow, but we were having a great time drinking... and drinking.  Let's just say the night ended with my friend trying to demonstrate to all the guys his hulk strength.  Demonstrate by trying to side grip a tree and keep his body straight.  Total fail.It was after 10pm, so we ordered a few bites off the pub menu.  The Pork Rillettes were alright, but I really liked the House Cut Chips.  Perfect with the malt vinegar aioli.  I also tried some Amish Chicken Wings, which were very vinegary with a kick.  But it went well with the chive creme fraiche.Next time I'll be back earlier in the night, since their dinner menu sounds pretty good."
"This place is just awesome. It's plain exterior and flash neighboring businesses have hidden it from me for years. Honestly, I always just assumed the place was a bar. I was shocked to find out that it is a high quality gastro pub serving some amazing British-style food!I'm Scottish born and raised and while I don't need something just like home I love any place that can match flavors and inject their own style into it.I ate the Ploughman's as my main but tried many littles as well. The drinks were also well made, well served and well priced.Finally, the service was fast, effective and courteous. I did not expect a bearded man in purple flannel to come across as professional but he more than did that."
"I finally got here for the Tuesday burger special. The burger really is one of the best in the city. I've come across few burgers that have a beefy flavor quite like this one. I added cheese ($2), but it was easily good enough to stand on its own.The fries could have been an afterthought given the quality of the burger, but this was hardly the case. They were well-salted and had a great texture (crackly crisp exterior, pillowy interior). The accompanying aioli was also quite excellent and even felt surprisingly light.Come on, though. $15 for a burger, a beer, and a shot of bourbon really sells itself. With a deal like that, how could you not check it out?"
"Amazing juicy burger, super fresh fish and chips, bone marrow is like an incredible adult peanut butter and jelly sandwich, house made pickles, outstanding beer selection. Win!"
"A phenomenal 5 star restaurant at 3-4 star prices. We had the Taglierini (freshly made egg noodles, cherry tomatoes, fresh basil, roasted pine nuts and a lemon pine nut emulsion) which was out of this world. We also had the lamb pasty (delightfully flakey, golden brown crust) and the fish and chips with malt vinegar aoli (the aoli was amazing and the chips are freshly made). With three drinks (2 alcoholic) the total bill came to only $60. Also, this is the most authentic looking pub I'be seen outside of England. Can't wait to return."
"Great food, ambiance, service. A bit pricy but will def return! Free st parking."
Scotch Egg was amazing.  Great beer selection and knowledgeable staff.  Pretty laid back nice restaurant atmosphere.
I have been here two times now.  Once for brunch and another time for dinner.  Portions are small but the prices high!!!The scallops I had at dinner were delicious but it consisted of 4 scallops for around $17
Cool atmosphere. Great service. Love the decor n woodwork. Great food. Scones were the best I've had.  The bacon is in a class of its own.  Very nice selection of craft beers. They also accommodated my son's food allergy.
"Have you ever read about a restaurant review from somewhere thinking, I ought to try it and rarely do...Well, I saw an article from Serious Eats and they wrote about Owen and Engine as having the best burgers in Chicago... whoa - that is quite a statement! To sweeten the pot - there's also a Beer, Bourbon, and Burger special? At this point, it is too good to just ignore and forwarded the email to my burger lovin' friend whom she quickly responded, does next Tue work for you?Done.Indeed it is a exceptional burger, it hits the spot for one who is craving some serious gourmet, grassfed grease.For the non-bovine connoisseur the menu looks very promising and hopefully will make another trip out to sample the rest. Happy eating!"
"Couldn't decide what to have for dinner the other night.  A couple of friends were discussing all foods British the other day and I may have had that in mind when I stopped in here.  I love when bar or restaurant owners go the extra mile and detail their washrooms.  It's silly when you go to a new place and every last detail is thought of when decorating an interior and then you make it to the washroom and it turns out to be a plain white room with cheap hardware and you're left wondering if they ran out of money or just didn't care.  I know, starting off the review with their Blokes room.  But, with that in mind.  We'll begin.  Tally-whacker in hand I looked around at the wall & tiles. My eyes were captured by the dark skinned wallpaper.  As I filled the porcelain bowl I thought how sweet it'd be if the vintage flowery details of the wallpaper's design were velvet to the touch.   Guess what? It was! I want my washroom like this. British pub. Check. Not like the burger place on Lincoln, Jury's. Same cozy feel but massively modern.  They have TVs but its not necessary to be on. Ambient music played lightly in the background, the easy chatter of ladies around me; filled the room.  Bar with a step to lay the feet, great compliment to their customer.  Not that it was needed but their bar chair offers an arm to rest your feet as well.Bartenders attentive. I wait for my Cornish pasty, the fish and chips were sold out!  I first heard about pasty on a long ass family trip through the U.P. decades ago.  (U.P. = upper peninsula) At that time so many years ago, it's all you would find at most restaurants, well that and smoked fish.  Some years later I watched a documentary on the original pasty that housewives once made for their hardworking coal mining men. Two types of pasty's exist. Original and the upgrade; which included dessert! Imagine a two hander pasty with meat and potatoes on the one side and blueberry pie on the other. Fucking awesome yes?Owens' pasty is made with lard which is credo to doing it the original way. Crisco is the only other way I've had it.  The taste was savory, the flakiness of the crust and moist in its texture. The bartender was hovering to take my plate upon completion.  Except one piece lay waiting to be devoured.  Leg of lamb should be savored, I replied.  The price was spot on.  A pasty dinner with picalilly, chutney and arugula salad.  $11.  Just enough to fill the dinner appetite.  If chips came along, it'd been perfect.  This paired with a couple Allagash White and the total with tax was about $23.  Made a few fast friends at the bar and enjoyed a couple whiskey shots with staff.  How cool? Yes.  A good meal inside, new camaraderie created, time to head down the street to find a sultry friend.If good beer selection is your often companion for nights out.  I recommend a trip starting with Quenchers, then Owen & engine and a night cap at Underbar.  It worked for me."
"Went on a Saturday evening--early around 6:00--no reservation. The place fills up on the early side rather than the usual 7:30-9:00 window like a lot of places in the city. Found a seat in the lounge area in the upstairs bar. Great service, and the ambiance is reminiscent of a lived-in upstairs area of Barrel House Flat and/or more cozy Hubbard Inn (library/living room feel). Started with the house made breads--generous portion of various breads, especially for the price. The butter with sea salt was melt in your mouth yummy, as was the bacon jam spread. For entrees, ordered the burger--came with caramelized onions on top that added good flavor and french fries with an aioli. The indian spiced half chicken came with naan (a bit different from others I've had--but good) and a really delicious mix of textures and flavors--paneer, blueberry-tamarind chutney, roasted cauliflower, mint-cilantro raita. It all really came together. Portions were quite generous, and I eyed the cheese plate that someone next to us ordered. The cocktails were comparable in variety and quality to other cocktail-centric bars in the city, and I loved the Cuvee de Jacobins Rouge--slightly effervescent red ale with notes of balsamic vinegar and sweetness--served in a sparkling wine glass. Would recommend Owen and Engine, hands down. Come hungry, and arrive early for a seat if you don't already have a reservation. An off the beaten path gem."
"Came in after a movie for late dinner. Friend got the burger and I got the fish & chips. Food was surprisingly lightly seasoned for pub fare. Friend's burger was almost bland, maybe they forgot to salt it? Really enjoyed my fish and chips though, lightly battered, perfectly moist fish and flavorful fries (not the crispy shoestring type). The spring pea puree added a hint of sophistication to standard bar food. A bit of a trek for me from home but wouldn't mind returning if I'm ever in logan square again."
My 4th or 5th visit and everything is so consistently good here.  Tuesday's BBB special for $15 is the best deal around. Check it out!
"1 hour wait? No problem...Their upstairs bar is a cozy setup with both dining and relaxing couches to sit on. They have great beers/cider and the food is something everyone should enjoy. Everything from the decor to the on the point fresh ingredients were something I really enjoyed about this restaurant. I chose the Pork ""Bangers"" which were some of the tastiest and tender sausages atop some of the creamiest mashed potatoes and sweet caramelized onion gravy. I saw someone order the bone marrow. If/when I go back, that will be on my bill no doubt. Looked phenomenal. Great location if you are cool for paying for garage parking at the movie theater across the street. If not parking on the street could be tricky."
"Best Burger I've ever had! (something I don't hand out lightly)  Trying their fish and chips tonight.If you are in the area and craving some of the most creative and tasty food in chicago, this is the place for you.  Oh and bonus points for their incredible beer and liquor selection.  Even more bonus points to the amazing and knowledgable staff!10/10 will eat here at least twice a month until I move out of the area."
"2.5 starsI know I'm going against the crowd here, but I thought this place was fairly average.  I enjoyed my meal, but I wasn't wowed.  And the food was too expensive for the quality.  And the service kind of sucked too.  Did I order the wrong meal and get the wrong server?  Perhaps?  But I'll tell you what really ruined my experience was when i went to use the ""loo"".  It was nice enough looking, but it smelled like a sewer.  Made me want to puke it smelled SO DISGUSTING.  I nearly lost my appetite right there and then.Food: My father and I both ordered the burger.  It was $14 straight up (no cheese or bacon).  Cheese and bacon were $2 a piece extra.  So a bacon cheeseburger would have cost me $18.  FUGGETABOUTIT!!!  I got the burger plain.  The burger took 40 minutes.  WTF?  How does a burger take 40 minutes?  Luckily we had ordered one appetizer.  Unluckily it was a tasteless piece of fried meat.  While waiting patiently for our food, our server never came to check on us.  He did stop by when we finished our beers, but after 30 minutes he should have said something about our food.  I finally ask him and he says it's coming right out.  10 minutes later we get the burgers and they aren't even cooked all the way through.  We ate them anyway because we had a movie to go to.  They were tasty, but not $14 tasty.  Of course I got sick, although my father didn't and I ended up paying for it the next day.    I guess my last gripe is the location.  What a horrible location.  Unless you are going to a movie there is no reason to go over there.  There just isn't.  Lesson learned:  Eat before going to movie at City North Theater."
"Yes, the standards are right on: great whiskey, beer selection, fish and perfectly done chips.But can we talk about the bone marrow?  It would have been indecent to pick up that bone and suck it dry-- but these folks almost gave me no choice.  The marrow bones are cut lengthwise for easy access to the juicy bits, but it doesn't stop there!  How about we add more butter, panko breadcrumbs, and snails?  The answer is yes, yes, yes!"
"Probably my new favorite restaurant in the city.  Sure, some of the dishes are hit or miss, but I've had WAY more hits than misses.  Then to top it all off, they have the best burger in Chicago, and I've had a ton of burgers in Chicago.  Just make sure to get the burger medium rare, closer to the rare side is even better.The one issue I have is that the burger is SO good, I have trouble not ordering it.  Everything else is good, the fish and chips are pretty great.  Actually, pretty much everything has a great flavor and balance to it, this is the place that taught me that chicken has an amazingly delicious flavor all of it's own, when done right.  The veggies and sides served with meals aren't just throw-aways, they're critical components to the dish and add a ton of flavor.  I also always need to order the pickles as an appetizer, you never know what you're going to get, fennel, brussel sprouts, green beans, beats...The staff has also been superb.  I still remember the first time I came and I jokingly asked if the chocolate financier was chocolate in the form of JP Morgan, and was informed that it was, with a whole story about what each of the components represented in a class struggle.  This was then laughed off and the answer was, ""No, it's just a chocolate cake.""  When the staff is having fun while still providing great service, you know you've found a good, well run establishment.I haven't even addressed the bar yet, which is also superb.  Great bear selection and some great cocktails.  It is all fairly low-key, they seem to take their inspiration from the classics, but that is the way I like it."
"Now after doing an extensive Google search for almost 5 minutes, I still cannot figure out why there are so many English restaurants in Chicago named _ and _ (Owen and Engine, Bangers and Lace, Elephant and Castle, Blokes and Birds, Longman and Eagle). Still left dumbfounded, so I would appreciate an answer from someone more informed than myself. After visiting England twice, I can say that the grub I ate Saturday night at O&E was better than anything I had in their motherland. England is not known for their fine cuisine, but O&E refines American favorites including their well-known burger.  I also undertook an adventure I have been putting off for awhile now. Unexpectedly, this past weekend I broke my oyster cherry. Friends ordered the dozen oysters. I quickly grabbed an oyster, slurped it up, and swallowed the slimy thing before anyone could take any embarrassing iPhone video of the sour, disgusted look I surely displayed. No comment on the oyster quality as I still can't get over their sliminess. The pretzels with mustard/cheese? sauce is scrumptious and would recommend. All four in our party feasted on the burger. 3/4 went straight-up with the grilled onions only. One friend ventured out into the unknown, going ""all the way"" with his burger topping it with an egg, bacon, and cheese. For first timers, get the burger classic style. While our server did not have an English accent, his attempts were humorous and so close to authentic, O&E really makes any effort to make your dining experience a truly English one. The beer list astonishes and trying a couple were an absolute delight. The ambience and building itself is very impressive. All the details from the wallpaper, mirrors, and lounge couches along with the excellent service and beer list will draw me back to this establishment. Plus, I learned of the Tuesday deal O&E rocks- Burger, beer and shot of bourbon for $15. Who can pass that up?"
"'Ello Gobna.  Spot'a tea for ya then? Bloody 'ell, ya' got some on me britches!  S'all right, no need to throw a wobbly ya bloomin' twat!After getting all of my English slang out the of they way (this took a while mind you,) I was able to finally sit back and enjoy myself at classic English brew-pub, Owen & Engine. I'd actually been here a couple of times, so I've had the opportunity to sample the beer list (I use the term ""sample"" here loosely as it was really more of a binge) and try out multiple food options.  Of course, when I'm drinking a traditional English beer, sitting in what appears to be a traditional English pub, using up all of my traditional English slang, I want some traditional English food.  So what better way to test out the bar fare than by ordering up some traditional fish & chips. The verdict? I can honestly say that this plate ranks up there with the best fish & chips I've ever had.  The fish was amazingly textured, the pea sauce is just the right amount of flavor, and the tartar sauce is perfectly complimentary.  I had also heard rumblings that their burger was the dog's bollocks, so I thought I'd give that a whirl on another occasion.  Again, I was completely satisfied.The quality of meat at this place is quite amazing, coming straight from local meat provider Slagel Farms. They'll even tout this to all of their customers, oftentimes encouraging you to try your meals without a lot of extra flair and condiments.  After all, quality meat doesn't really need much more than just being in your stomach.Naturally, they'd be flat out liars if they didn't have beers on the engine as the name implies and luckily, they pull through.  They generally have three beers on the engine, being local brewers all of the times I've gone, making the experience even more interesting.  Their draft beer list changes often, and you can almost always find something interesting and new to test out with your food.So Bob's your uncle, Owen & Engine is a pretty solid place to go.  Just remember to cool it with the English-isms after you've left (unless you're English of course.)  But in the meantime, cheerio!"
Right across from the movies. Get a quick drink and boom. Good drinks and food. would recommend
"After a night of Christmas shopping, two friends decided to replenish their bodies with a meal from Owen & Engine. The ladies opted for burgers made from Slagel Farms beef served with carmelized onion, aged stilton, potato bap and chips. The burgers were cooked to perfection. The bap stood up to the meatiness of the burger, yet retained its lightness. The fries were some of the best to be had, accompanied by a wonderul malt vinegar aioli. The girls finished their meals, let out a collective sigh of satisfaction and vanished into the cold night air with full, happy bellies. Yet, there was still a longing for doughnuts and pot de creme... Will these hungry mystery ladies return to satisfy their craving for more of Owen & Engine's elevated British pub fare? The saga contintues..."
Its far from being a British pub or British pub food. But the banger's and mash were pretty good.
"Great spot.  I've been here several times now.  The first, despite my 5-star review, was a total dud: I went for the Tuesday night burger/beer/bourbon special and was disappointed, primarily in the burger, which was just not very good.  (I mentioned this to a waiter on a subsequent visit and was told I'm the first to ever say this.  I doubt that, but I'll accept that I'm in the minority.)I went back anyway and I'm really glad I did.  On my next visit I mentioned my burger disappointment and the waiter -- a very cool guy -- indicated his surprise and brought me a shot of rye to make up for things.  It worked.  That night I had the fish and chips and they were terrific.  On subsequent visits I've had the Cornish pasty, which I adore and will keep having every time I go there.  The beer list is terrific and spirits just as good.  I like the decor and the clientele always seem friendly.  This is a great spot to bring some friends for a night of booze, laughing, and good food.  (But not the burger.)"
"I continue to be really impressed with Owen & Engine. Great booze, great food, and, most importantly, great service. They have one of the best burgers in the city. There's also plenty of things for those with restricted diets to eat (vegetarian, gluten-free, whatever).A small quibble: I wish there was some crowd control. I was here recently when a group of guys were taking up a bunch of extra barstools with their coats (stools they were not sitting in). It wouldn't have been a big deal except there were no there seats and they were really rude when I asked them if they were using the stools. Some support from the staff would have been awesome, but it didn't happen."
"So excited to come back to O&E. Great burgers, great Kale salad, yummy fries and aioli and good beer/cocktail selection. The atmosphere is super cozy and the bartender/wait staff was really nice."
"My top 3 best burger in Chicago thus far (with Davanti Enoteca & Longman, all in no order). I was completely blown away by this burger. I am currently drooling as a I recall last Saturday. My best friend and I needed a hangover meal without a wait. I suggested O & E without any expectations because I had not been and had not heard much on the radar about it. We got there around 12 on a Saturday. No Wait. Hell yea! Bonus points. Although we were ironically skeptical that there wasn't a wait...yet we stayed because we were starving. The place is cozy, a little outdated, but still gives off a cool pub vibe. Maybe it's more trendy at night, but it was pretty dorky during the day. There were some dorky midwest families around us so it caters to more than the 20 somethings. The waitress was solid vanilla. She was very unmemorable and blah. But she was just the salad of the meal. In comes the meat....this juicy, fresh, pretty large, kind of greasy burger from heaven. The bun was fantastic..the egg..the cheese..it was all so perfect. The fries were SO good too. I cannot vouch for the rest of the menu, but my friend and I were really really happy with the burger. FYI, I will be working this meal off until summer. Anyways, just go here. Actually don't because then there will be a wait. But if you do decide to go, don't expect personality to serve you. Luckily for this place the burger was so damn good that I really could care less about who served it. I will be back to test the consistency...so please continue to deliver excellent food!"
"Let me preface this review by saying that I did not try the food, but the review is based on my experience. We (a group of about 8-10 people) showed up at Owen & Engine at about 10 PM on a Saturday night, the bar wasn't too crowded yet as soon as we walked upstairs I hear a bartender say ""Fuck this."" Usually when I walk into an establishment, I don't really like to know that the people that will be serving me are unhappy to see me there. This particular bartender had a nasty attitude all night, he was short-tempered and I understand if you don't like your job, but the fact that in the service industry, most of your income comes from tips you should at least put your best fake smile on and inwardly hate. However, the other bartender, who looks like a sexy Kenneth from 30 Rock (yes, it can happen) was very friendly and accommodating. I do plan on coming here and trying the food, hopefully the evil ogre of a bartender won't be there, because he projects some serious negative energy, man."
"Fantastic beer selection.Friendly wait staff.Very limited menu, and not at all vegetarian friendly (not an issue for me, but is for my wife).But the food is... amazing.  I think they have one of, if not the, best burgers in Chicago.The ambiance is nice.  You get a real british pub vibe in there.But this place is trendy, and very much a hipster magnet (both in clientele and staff).  It is loud on a night visit, and very crowded.Make a reservation.  Seriously.  I have so many made the mistake of thinking ""the wait won't be that long"" only to be sorely disappointed and be waiting at the bar for an hour at least.   And that's standing at the bar, since the seats are taken up because, as I mentioned, the place is packed.  I've pondered slipping the host/hostess a $20 to see if it bumps us up the list, but I never have the chutzpah to give it a go.But any place that serves cask ales is okay in my books, and they serve *four*!  It's a great spot to visit before or after seeing a movie across the street.  But, again... *reservation*!  Don't leave home without it."
"Been here.  OSH on tap.  That's Old Speckled Hen on tap.  Cecil love.  Me and Schmackie (Schmackie and I) came with Jeanette and Daniel.  Savage evening.  Super British, mate.  Like a pub in London but a little bit fancier.  I totally fancy this place, yeah.  Arsenal.  North London.  Muswell Hill."
"This place rocks. It always has a couple of Real Ales pumped with a beer engine. The food menu is very creative. I can't recall the chef's name but she really can do some creative stuff. Try the sweetbreads. the best. The portions are decent and the staff is good. It is a good value for what you pay. It really is a gastro-pub with some up-scale dishes, more like what you would get at a gourmet resto."
"This is the best dinner and a movie combo you will ever see (there is a movie theater next door). Go for the awesome selection of english pub beer. The inside of this place looks like an english pub. Their burger is great, one of the best in the city. So is the fish and chips. Charcuterie is also very good. Not everything on the menu is great , but I like that they change the menu often and try new/fun dishes. Will go back every time I go to a movie.PS - if you prefer to sleep through your movie, go to fat willy's rib shack (also next door). They also have great food."
"You have got to try this place! All the times I have passed this place I assumed it was massive inside. It's quite the opposite, it's quaint, intimate and cozy with the lots of wood, wallpaper and candlelight. We started with a pitcher of Pimm's O&E, caramel corn, which we inhaled and grilled wild ramps. This was my first experience with ramps and I have been craving them every day since our visit. Seriously, so very good! The pan roasted half chicken is where it's at. It's a ton of food and has loads of flavor, you won't be disappointed with this selection. The mussels were very tasty as well. The service was great. Our waiter was very knowledgeable and made lots of recommendations, which we really appreciated. We will be back!"
"Great ambiance, awesome food and beer menu. The folks who run the place are serious about the beer knowledge and serving amazing food. Had the Kale salad and mussels to start and split the chicken dish. Finished it off with a yummy bourbon beer."
"My good friend Charlie and I are still reeling from a completely random trip to this adorable pub on Saturday. Elliott showed us how to make their delicious Malort cocktail step-by-step (along with an amazing history lesson to accompany all of the ingredients), and a taste test of a new Filipino liquor he'd picked up. We had an intense discussion on anklet socks, drank delicious drinks, and all was right in the world.Descriptive quote of the night, ""... Did we just stumble upon the greatest bar in Chicago?"""
"You want to know what makes a good place great? Saturday nights. This place was brimming with people, having to deny newcomers because there was just simply not one seat available, anywhere. And the staff? Cool as cucumbers. Savvy as snakes, winding in and out of a controlled and disarmed crowd. What an exciting atmosphere; to be working at capacity and doing so with ease? Maybe I will come before midnight if I want a seat next time."
"I have been here probably 10 times. Every time is usually the same because I go on weekend evenings around 8 or 9PM before seeing a movie with my boyfriend. Obviously I like the place! It's usually crowded and busy and they always tell you it will be a 1-2 hour wait (kind of like Kuma's Corner), but it usually ends up being 30 mins or less if you don't mind sitting at the bar. Many times we've been offered a table shortly after sitting at the bar so it's never a bad wait either way. Atmosphere- Dark, romantic, cozy, yet elegant. Typically busy so I wouldn't recommend this place on a weekend to people who dislike crowds/close contact with others. For me, it makes it a better experience. Everyone is there for a reason, right?! Food- some people are complaining about portions, but that's never been a complaint of mine. If you order scallops from a decent restaurant you're probably not going to get an enormous portion. Think before you order and you won't be disappointed. Also, their meats are humanely raised and from hormone free farms. That's important to me. The burger (as others state) is A+. Honestly one of my favorites in the city. Beer- Good selection and very unique offering of ""room temp"" craft beers. I can't remember what they're called. *In the case of good craft beers, the low temperatures just dampen the flavor, causing you to miss all the things that would open up if a little warmer. This, so far, is the only place in Chicago I've been that offers beer in this fashion. Usually they only have about 3 or so at a time that are served this way. The rest are bottled or from a normal tap. Kudos to Owen & Engine for being different here!Coffee- I will have to try it this evening and report back :)Go here! *esquire.com/blogs/food-f…"
"Cozy atmosphere with really amazing burgers.  I recommend going on a Tuesday night for their special 'burger, beer and whiskey' combo.  It's a great deal!  The movie theater right next door also does a deal on Tuesdays too - win win!   As long as you show up relatively early (by 6pm), you shouldn't even have to wait."
"After making and canceling reservations several times, I finally had the opportunity to get the burger at Owen and Engine.  I'm sure we all know about the special by now. You get the $14 dollar burger on Tuesday with a shot of bourbon and a beer for an extra buck.  I was half expecting a shot of swill and a PBR, but I was pleased to find out that they give you a quality brew and a respectable, albeit small, hit of bourbon.  Our server was awkward but pleasant.  I had trouble understanding him through his beard and fitted flannel shirt.  In fact all the guys had fitted flannel shirts.  Kind of gave the place a Euro Paul Bunyan meets the Old West vibe.  The décor and lighting accentuated the feel of Cowboys vs. Lumberjacks.And now we talk about the burger.  You want cheese; it'll cost you two bucks.  You want some other shit; it'll probably cost you a couple bucks.  They'll even put some pygmy lamb on it or whatever the hell our server was talking about.  The meat patty itself was massive.  I'm not a drug dealer, but I'd say it weighed at least as much as a half pound of good street coke.  This burger was probably the best I've ever had.  All the ingredients complimented one another. In a stroke of genius, the lower bun was skillfully constructed larger than the top which helped soak up rivers of nourishment bursting out of the burger like a savory flavor volcano.  Even the fries were served with a scrumptious dipping aioli.  I could see the objective observer saying, ""$14 for a burger, I ate dinner at a gas station last night"".  Oh well, nerd. Sometimes you get dealt the Meat Mercedes in life and sometimes you get dealt the busted ass Chevy shit-burger.  Eat it or starve, Mother Fucker."
"We all need a reminder from time to time of the old cliche ""you can't judge a book by it's cover"". I have probably gone by Owen and Engine 100 times since I've lived in the neighborhood. From the outside it just sort of looks like your standard British/Irish pub. Also, the fact that it's right next to the move theater, had me picturing twenty-two year old's downing pints of Guinness and high- fiveing about the Hunger Games. I couldn't have been more wrong.      We almost tripped on some slush in the entryway, but once we were inside the decor is classy-comfy and the food is excellent. As other reviewers have pointed out the fish and chips were top notch. Not a single sign of grease beneath the hardy chunks of deliciousness. The fish was definitely fresh they weren't trying to hide low quality fish by frying it, like some places do. They have a good selection micro brews that will surely satisfy the beer snob in your party. The server was pretty good and more then willing to go into detail about any dish or drink on the menu. He was able to stay on the line between classy and pretentious, without falling over on the pretentious sign. That being said Owen & Engine is definitely the restaurant equivalent of a hot girl that knows she's hot, but to be fair when you have something good you should be proud of it. I'll be back sometime in the near future."
"The burger deserves a five star review, and despite a few missteps here and there, O&E is pretty consistently good.  If it's a nice day, I suggest trying to get to the outside seating area upstairs for brunch.  They do a proper English fry-up and the salt beef hash is as good as I've had anywhere.  Pretty hard to beat paired with a Red Snapper.As other reviewers have mentioned, it's in an odd location.  They've so carefully curated an atmosphere inside, but it's pretty difficult to appreciate when neon lights from the movie theater and Burger King are blazing in every window.  I suppose they probably clean up with movie theater traffic though..."
Awesome place! Great great great burgers!!! Second floor bartender provided excellent service to us the entire night. Probably one of the best experiences I've had at a restaurant. Highly recommend - not going to write an essay. 5 stars plain and simple. Go.
"In my review of Fat Willy's Rib Shack I mentioned that really it's a 4, but when viewed as one half of the awesome combo of dinner and a flick at the Western Ave movie theater, it's a 5.  The fact that I forgot about Owen & Engine when valuing that combo is a shame that I will have to live with for the rest of my life.Owen & Engine offers a wide array of English cuisine, for which I have a soft spot ever since studying there in high school.  Please refrain from discounting my subsequent reviews after reading that statement.  I had the Shepard's Pie, which was a special, and it was excellent.  Innit right guv'na?"
"My husband and I have been to Owen & Engine a few times but only for drinks and a few appetizers. When discussing where to go for his birthday dinner he expressed interest in somewhere where he could get a steak and a whiskey. His sister suggested Owen & Engine and that's where we decided to go. I made a reservation online and then called to see if they do anything for birthdays. I was told that if we order a dessert they would put a candle on it. That sounded great to me. As always, everyone was very pleasant and accommodating. Our food was outstanding and the best part was, they comped our two desserts! I would highly recommend Owen & Engine for the amazing food and service. It's a cozy place to spend an evening."
"Guys.  The burger is all I've had so I can't speak about the whole menu... but THAT BURGER.  It's like french onion soup and a burger had a baby.  A glorious, juicy baby.  Best burger I've had in Chicago.  We went on a quiet night and it was lovely."
"This is my second time here. First time in the summer- vibes good, food great, awesome service. Second time was today-food great- especially fish and chips and burger. Unfortunately the waitress was not. Service was unfriendly. She rolled her eyes a few times, brought us one small ketchup container for FOUR people each with fries. Really? When we asked for more she, she questioned why.Will come back but hopefully not have the same waitress."
"Loved this spot. Great beers, AMAZING burgers, and very cozy atmosphere (especially the upstairs). Got there on a tuesday for the burger/beer/bourbon speical - you wont regret it."
"Used to be my go-to (4-5/month), but the rude waitress whom would prefer to text and chat with the bartender rather than take 2 minutes to get me mustard resulted in a cold burger.  Did they get a new owner?  I won't be back to find out.  If you do go and have a disappointing experience or service, don't waste your time by calling them unless you like being hung-up upon."
"Been here several times now and have had most of the menu items. The scotch egg and soft pretzel are must-try snacks. The burger and the fish and chips are a daydream interpretation of working man grub. We have also enjoyed the cheese plate, pork rinds, amish chicken wings, bangers and mash, salad.... okay, so the food is great. The cocktails are good, not excellent, but their beer selection is impressive. My wife was amused to discover that hot buttered rum is indeed literally hot rum with butter melted into it. This place really emulates an authentic British pub (according to our token British friend).I would give this place 4.5 stars if I could. They've got great heart, but are missing that extra something that makes a place transcendent."
I went there for brunch for the first time last Sunday.  A very interesting cocktail menu and  great selection of bunch will keep me coming back for more.
"Overrated IMO. Disappointed in the fish and chips. The malt vinegar aoli was poured over the top of the fish ruining the crispy batter, as did the green pea cream under the fish. The chips were standard issue French fries that were not even improved with liberal doses of malt vinegar. This was an overpriced frou frou rendition of a British classic.  Even though the lace had a nice pub feel, we were stuck back in the corner across from the loos and near kitchen, not very relaxing. No issues with service, DH enjoyed his clam chowder with mussels."
"The scotch egg is good enough, but not the best I've had.  The french fries with malt vinegar mayonnaise, on the other hand, are amazing.  And I don't even like mayonnaise and when I've gotten the same thing elsewhere I generally haven't liked it.Skip the cocktails and the other beers on the menu; if you're coming here the whole point is the real ale.  Which would justify the 5/5 rating on its own."
"I went to Owen and Engine for the first time last night for a birthday. We were a large party, but our server was extremely engaging and accommodating in every way.  The food was superb, of course, but the impassioned descriptions of food and drink is what made this a stand-out experience.Everything we ordered was excellent. I was personally slightly underwhelmed by the Scotch Egg, but probably only due to the hype.  Eager to go back!"
"Owen & Engine is a legit space, draped in lavish wood and subtle lighting,  that looks exactly like a firehouse, assuming you've never been to one. There are two floors to this fun, British spot, and lots to love.  On my visit, the food was very disappointing, but everything else was really great.On a busy Saturday night we sat down upstairs with a group of three.  We drank some good beers, and enjoyed the hell out of some vinegary boiled peanuts.  We moved on to the wings and a burger, because they had ran out of the fish n' chips everyone raves about.  Here's the lowdown:Wings -  While the outside of the wings were golden and crispy, the sauce was insanely overpowering.  There was so much vinegar that it choked me up as I brought the wing to my mouth.  I couldn't really taste much besides vinegar for the rest of the meal, a major bust. Cheeseburger - Overcooked!  We asked for it Medium, and it came out well done.  At this point in the meal the service slowed down a lot, and we were just ready to go.  The waiter apologized, comped our burger, and bought us a dessert. The service and space here is fantastic, which is why I would like to return soon.  I've heard great things about the food, but my visit didn't yield that same experience."
Amazing fish and chips. Beautiful interior and great service.
"This place is great.  Three of us came in on a Saturday night, and sat at the bar for some food and beers (awesome beer list).  I would have loved a table, but they were (not surprisingly) busy and had no tables right away [though, while we were at the bar, there were several tables that had cleared and sat empty for quite a wihle... a little annoying, but whatever].The chaps behind the bar were super friendly and helpful, explaining their beverages & menu items.  I wasn't that hungry, so I opted for a warm pretzel with delicious honey mustard sauce, and a fresh salad with leaf lettuce, snap peas, sliced radishes and a fantastic buttermilk ranch dressing.  It was simple, delicate and all had great flavor.  (My only gripe is menu prices were just a tad high.  I know it's good food, but the salad was $10 and not that big, and the pretzel was $4 - average size.)I'd love to go back when I'm feeling more up to one of their entrees.  My companions got a steak sandwich and the fish and chips - both cleaned their plates and said everything was delish. Everything was upscale, great / sexy decor, great / sexy staff, great food!  **After circling the nearby blocks for 10 minutes looking for a parking spot, we checked out the parking garage for the theater, across the street - $2 flat.  Head straight for the garage when you're next there, save yourself the trouble!"
"Oh my goodness, this place. So good. so GOOD.This was just a fantastic evening - a few beers beforehand, and the entire event flowed seamlessly from devouring my delectable burger (oh yes, with the egg, and the bacon, and the cheese, oh yes indeed) to sampling just about everyone else's dish as well. Unheard-of beers, a charismatic waiter, deft at handling a group of ten, odd looking dark decor that is reminiscent of an older time when everyone had character, felt articles of clothing, and decidedly yellow teeth. The drawback of course is that it is a bit spendier than other restaurants, but in my opinion, the experience is well worth the cost. Will absolutely come here again."
"40% ground chuck, 30% dry aged short rib, 30% brisket.  This was the makeup of the hamburger that I had at Owen and Engine last night.  Cooked medium rare, served on some kind of onion bun, it was heavenly.  Going here just for a burger is a great idea, but there's so much more. Beer.  I haven't been drinking a lot of beer lately, but they've got a really nice selection.  There's even a decent selection of wine and spirits. I had an itch that I couldn't scratch, because I didn't know where it was itching.  Well, once I had a bottle of the Goose Island Orange Cream soda, I stopped itching. The fact that it happened right after I took a shower is pure coincidence: the itching was due to lack of cream soda. We started with the Scotch Egg and the pickles.  There was pickled cantaloupe and asparagus -- enough said.  Aside from the burger, we also had the scallops, which I can highly recommend.  The potatoes served with the scallops were delicate, tasty and cooked just right.  Now, I've got a great tip for date night.  On Tuesdays, the movie theater right next to Owen and Engine has matinee prices all day.  Plus, on Tuesdays at Owen and Engine, they've got the $15 special.  This special includes that wonderful burger, a beer and a shot of bourbon.  Once you throw in the fact that the movie theater has a sweet arcade, you've got the perfect storm for the best date of all time.  Or, you know, at least a good one."
"Have you ever wanted to walk into a someone manor, sit at their bar and get a great dinner but at a price that is friendly? Then this is the place to go. I had heard about this place from co-workers but never made it. Just happen to go in on Tuesday night with the boyfriend for thier $15 dinner special and WOW!!Walking into Owen & Engine, you really do feel like you have walked into someones home. I also likes the bathroom. Normally I don't mention this, but it is a great bathroom. it was not only cleaned, but it smelled liked fresh flowers and CLEAN!!Back to the food . . .The burger was amazing, the fries were so good I had to order an extra side of them. The shot of whiskey was amazing as well. Paired up with the beer you can not go wrong with this dinner in Chicago. I'm looking forward to coming back with my girls for our girlsnight out that we have. Plus, if you sit at the bar past 9pm, you just might get a little something extra. Can't wait to come back with friends and sit in my manor of a house."
"Come on,  guys.  Someone needs to explain to the chef that the batter on Fish and Chips is supposed to be crispy -  not like a soaked cardboard.  It was truly shameful for a gastropub!  On the bright side Scottish Egg was great,  and so was the Cornish Pasty.  Excellent service."
"Good beer menu.Average food.Not worth the hype.Don't get the BLT.  They say how it is housemade bacon and they sell a BLT sandwich- so I expect a nice thick slab of bacon on my bread, but was disappointed with what looked like 3 strips of Oscar Mayer.Many better gastropub options in Chicago."
"As loyal fans of the movie theater across the street, we were excited when a new pre-movie dinner option opened. We finally tore ourselves away from the BBQ next door, and we weren't disappointed!We started with the homemade pork rinds, which were actually the only mediocre part of the meal. For entrees I had the fish and chips, and the husband had the burger. Yum! The fish was super light and flakey, with a nice tender breading and a vinegar sauce. The burger was succulent and juicy, and the cheddar cheese he added really complimented it. Don't expect char broiled, just expect something totally different and delicious in its own way. The fries were good, but the fact that they came with plain mayo and a homemade ketchup was kind of a bummer. I'd rather have plain ketchup and homemade aioli! Then there's the SUPER reasonably priced beer list, which, in a world of places with craft beers on tap, actually was really unique. I had an unbelievable cider that I can't stop thinking about! We'll be back here many times!"
"Had a nice dinner but wasn't overly impressed. With all of the rave reviews for the fish and chips I knew it was gonna be on my list of things to try. Over all the best things I had tonight were the soft pretzel, fries and beer. The burger meat was very high quality but the overall burger was not memorable. The fish and chips were pretty good, nice and fresh without a spot of grease on my plate but again not the most memorable meal ever. I definitely will be going back to try the crispy kale salad and will defiantly be getting another pretzel!"
"The food here is right up the wife's alley and the beer selection is interesting enough to appeal to me, so this is our go-to compromise on a rare date night.  The food is the kind of stuff that C.S. Lewis describes in the Chronicles of Narnia, which is to say it is pretty British.  I am not super into that, but what I have had is pretty tasty.  The main selling point of this place is the ambiance.  It's very ""old boy's club"", as in one of those men's clubs where dudes would smoke cigars and talk about safaris in the early 1900s.  It's cool.  I have found the staff to be pretty cool, in opposition to some of the other reviews."
"Owen & Engine may be a member of the trendy ampersand club, but I won't hold that against it.  Really though, what's next And & And?  Anyway... some ladyfriends and I gave this one a go, and I'm glad that we did.  I arrived a little early and started in with one of their cask selections, the Arcadia IPA, which I enjoyed.  Two of us ordered the much lauded burger which was a hit.  The meat itself was the star, and was very flavorful and juicy.  Simply dressed with caramelized onions, they allow it to shine through.  You can also add a really nice cheddar, which I did.  The accompanying chips were great as well.  Our other dining companion went for the fish and chips which looked and smelled great though she could have done with out the mushy peas-esque puree underneath, and I personally would have ordered whatever sauce comes on top on the side.  But then again, I have a problem with white condiments.  The same friend also ordered a cocktail that looked like a liquid highlighter, tasted like liquid swee-tarts, had a rim of candied flowers, and still managed to be sophisticated.  What, what?  Impressive.A dessert of rhubarb crumble was a sweet treat, and the best part was the gravy boat of ginger creme anglaise.  I'd drink it... or bathe in it.  Whatever.  All of the staff were friendly and helpful and the atmosphere on a weeknight was chill.  Also the bathroom has fuzzy, pettable wallpaper.  I do have to say that the prices are on the higher side of what I'd like them to be, but when I'm feeling flush, I'll be back."
They do not get more snooty and pretentioius than this bar. At least the patrons I mean and the place isn't really anything special. It is basically fish n chips with craft beer and yuppies added to the mix. I am surprised this bar often gets mentioned as one of the cities best. The food was average and the place small and cramped almost in a strip mall type setting with the movie theatre right next door.
"I really wanted to like the food here. We sat in the front by the windows, such a cute interior. I ordered the infamous fish and chips, but to my surprise, the fish was severely under cooked. For $17 for 2 small pieces of under cooked haddock and some fries, I expected better execution. I might go back for drinks, but not for the food."
"Once upon a time, I would go to Owen & Engine for biweekly brunch with a friend. Then my friend became a vegan, and we don't go anymore.What do I miss most? The blue and white china? The delicious Eggs Benedict? The yummy scones? The way the waitress would pop up just as my friend got to the most awkward part of her story? The great ambiance and decor? There's no way to choose."
"The Sunday Brunch was excellent!We ordered scones, which were positively the most delicious I have ever eaten pastry-wise (and I don't like scones usually). Scones before having them at Owen & Engine were dry and stale entities. Now I know better. So tasty, moist, and fresh that the accompanying jams were not necessary. The jams they were served with were so fantastic, you just wanted to eat them with a spoon, scones forgotten.We also ordered fancy drinks, I had the Fuzzy Morning and my friend had a Mimosa. I wasn't too blown away with either taste and next time I will be ordering plain coffee or tea. For the main meal, we tried the grass-fed burger and the granola and yogurt. Both were rather large portions presented in a nice fashion. Oh my goodness, that burger- soooo good. I don't usually eat a lot of meat anymore, but I can see myself ordering this all the time if I were in Chicago more frequently.Our server was super-sweet and gave excellent recommendations to both of us. The only drawback of the whole experience was the host, who was just plain rude to us and not digging her job at all (you could tell). Smiles go a long way in life!"
"I hate to be a naysayer, but the place doesn't seem THAT British to me.  Sure, there is dark wood and paisley designs stenciled onto some of the glass.  The host was wearing a vest and tie, but it was not a natty English look, but more like a somewhat shabbier ""only an eyepatch away from steampunk"" look.  These days that is the hipster class-A uniform.  The rest of the staff was wearing the hipster B uniform.Furthermore, although they do have cask ales and a healthy selection of draft beer...only three of them are British.  Three.  This is a serious weakness.  I can get great American microbrews at dozens of bars in town.  If they want to set themselves apart, and especially if they want to brand themselves as a British pub, they need to offer more British beers.  It's just that simple.So why the four stars?  Well, their food is fantastic.  To start in medias res--their fish and chips are among the best anywhere.  Yes, ""anywhere"" includes Britain and Ireland.  The fish is top-notch and the batter is so light and oil-less that it barely tastes fried at all.  Savor every bite because you will be very sad when it is gone.To open the meal, I enjoyed the house pickle assortment, including earthy carrots, traditional cucumber pickles, red onion pieces, and grapes, all served in a country glass crock.  I also enjoyed the cauliflower soup, which, while a bit too salty, combined some incredible supporting flavors.Dessert was chocolate ""banoffee""--a combination of banana and toffee pudding.  The layered presentation was attractive, and when I could get all three components on one spoonful it was a delight for the taste buds too.The food menu is short, so perhaps I won't be rushing my next visit.  I imagine that I will be back sooner or later, though.  I'm sorry that their cocktail list looks far more compelling than the beer list, but perhaps I'll try a couple of those next time...in addition to a second helping of those perfect fish and chips."
"Jacob is the man! I mean it, he is a grandmaster server- Someone get that man a raise! He could've been snooty with all the questions we lobbed at him but he was so warm, enthusiastic, educated and refreshingly unpretentious- he explained everything and that made us understand then enjoy our visit tremendously!The boyfriend had a rough week, all he wanted was a burger and a beer. Maybe two beers. It enthusiastically turned into three beers, cocktails, dessert and promises we will be back very, very soon. This is the kind of place for a sophisticated man. Don't let the leather, wood paneling and wallpaper fool you (heh), This isn't a frou-frou-pink-fluffy-girly-drink place (which is great!) Upstairs, it is laid-back and lounge-like with big chairs, fireplace and even rooftop dining to come. Try it, you'll like it. Boyfriend had one of the greatest burgers ever, very juicy, flavorful and satisfying. He was incandescently overjoyed at the beer selection and the choices Jacob advised him on. I wasn't hungry in that way that means I only want to see dessert menu to try to order everything that is chocolate... and listen to Boyfriend tell me stories about Scotland. Do not miss the sublime Hot Chocolate: It is made with rich, pure, dark Venezuelan chocolate and served in a big pot with cute, buttery cinnamon toasts (like Grandma used to make) on the side that you will have to defend from other diners- delicious and highly recommended. Get going and I'll even share Jacob instead of pestering him all night with questions."
"There are two things that suck about this place.  First, it gets insanely crowded when you least expect it and trying to get reservations via phone is haphazard, at best.  If you get voice mail and leave a message per their suggestion, then assume you will never hear back from them (or, gosh darn it, they had one number off when they wrote down your contact info.......).  Second -- I don't care what day or time of day you are there, you must ALWAYS factor in an unnecessarily long time between the placement of your first drink order and the arrival of your first drink table side.  I assume there is either zippo communication or outright animosity between the wait and bar staff!That off my chest --- this is the most awesome pub in Chicago.  Don't let these two minor complaints keep you from going.  The food is awesome!  Craft cocktails and beer selection is awesome!  Ambiance is awesome!  While I try to mix it up, I keep coming back to the burger (they will even cook it rare!!), the fish and chips, the scotch egg, cinnamon toast, hot chocolate.....  The list could go on.  Burger is way better than all the other current favorites -- DMK, Au Cheval, etc.  I am torn between sitting upstairs or down -- both have their charms.  Even the building itself makes a dreary stretch of Western Avenue seem somehow special. Try this place.  Enjoy this place.  Just be prepared to pay your bill and vacate your table if I come in without reservations!"
"I'm sooooo happy I finally got to go to Owen & Engine. I'd been reading about it in food blogs for AGES! Well only like 6 months, because it hasn't been open that long, but that felt like an eternity in restaurant years! My friends and I went to O&E before heading to the movie theater to see Bridesmaids the other night. I ordered the Braised Swan Creek STREAKY BACON (baseically pork belly), Foraged Black Trumpet Mushrooms and Michigan Ramps. It was a small plate but it was enough food for me! Oh and I also ordered a side of Aged Cheddar Mash. It was absolutely scrumptious!I was also really impressed with the beer selection. I had very high expectations and was not disappointed! For starters I had the Bridgeport IPA which was hoppy and bright. I tried a sample of the Hoppy Feet black IPA but it wasn't my style. Later in the evening, I had the New Belgium La Folie sour beer on draught. It was a great end to a great meal. I don't live very far from O&E so I'll be going back to check out everything else on the menu, both food and booze!!!"
"I had heard a lot about Owen & Engine and while I was excited to try it, I worried that I would be disappointed after all the hype. Luckily, the hype was right! I make it a point not to order chicken out at restaurants (I'm worried I'm going to be ripped off for a tasteless chicken meal), but the pistachio rubbed chicken with fennel, fingerling potatoes and buerre blanc was calling my name. OMG, this chicken was the best chicken I have ever eaten. Seriously - that good. So moist and the flavors were perfectly balanced, not too heavy or overpowering in any one flavor profile. It was so good I ate the whole thing (with only a little help from my husband) and am still thinking about it. I also had a bite of their famous burger and wow, when I go back, it will be a fight between ordering the burger or the chicken. Yum. Our party ordered the pickles to start, which were better than most pickles I've ordered out (not too vinegary, yet not bland). I started with the Pimm's Cup, which was good but I prefer my Pimm's Cup to have more fruit/mint/cucumber muddled into it like how the mixologists make it in London. The staff was friendly but relaxed and the atmosphere was masculine without being too ""boy's club."" Will definitely be back...but will I order the chicken or the burger? hmmm...."
"I like it here.I found the service delightful and helpful. $3 beer on mondays seems pretty legit to me, though I guess that would be subjective depending on if you like their choice or not.Lets see we had...the salmon? i totally did not expect it to be a not warm dish but it was pretty tasty with the bread. I had the gnochi and a side of shishito peppers. Overall mixing everything was an interesting combo. Then we had the chocolate dessert, in which I enjoyed with my glass of whole milk =]We will def go again!"
"I was always under the impression that I wouldn't like English food - that if I lived in England, I would drop some el-bees by subsisting on a tea-and-occasional-scone diet.  I also attribute the popularity of games like cribbage and lawn bowling to a people unwilling to work up an appetite since there is nothing good to eat.    I'm probably still right.  Unless of course, the food is like the offerings at Owen & Engine.  Because that food is very good and would make anyone gain a few, and enjoy doing it.  I visited on a recent evening to celebrate my beloved's return from faraway lands, his belated half-birthday, and a handful of other reasons that demand a sweet date night.  I was mildly apprehensive at my menu previewing, since my food prefs are what you (and anyone who's ever eaten with me) might call ""limited.""  Truthfully, there were not more than a couple non-red-meat options, but I settled on the half-chicken with Brussels sprouts, mushrooms and sunchoke puree.   The plate came out hot, and everything looked so good I just wanted to eat it all in one bite.  I paced myself but really did nearly inhale the Brussels sprouts, which were small in number but large in taste.  I also thought the chicken - white meat especially - was super moist, with or without skin.For dessert, we'd considered the pot of hot chocolate with cinnamon toast on the drink menu, but eventually decided on the banofee.  Banofee is a combination of banana + toffee, so points to Owen and/or Engine for introducing a new word to two word nerds (and a dessert word, no less!).  The dessert itself is a combination of toffee, chocolate pudding (actually more of a mousse) and banana bread with banana and a graham cracker garnish.  No one element stood out as stellar, but it was overall a harmonious and inventive treat.  Overall, I was pleasantly surprised by the food, the service was friendly, and the aesthetic was, to use my favorite person's favorite descriptor, ""handsome.""  Date night list updated!"
"We ate here in late December and I'm just finally getting around to writing my review. We really loved this place and would definitely go back. It's small, so definitely make a reservation. Fantastic service - our waiter did a great job helping us select dishes and pair them with beer. He even brought us beer samples when we couldn't decide. We started with the charcuterie and cheese plate. It had a really nice selection of meats and cheeses that differed from other places in the city. People at our table ordered the fish and chips, bangers and mash, and the burger. They were all great. The atmosphere was warm and inviting too."
"Owen & Engine excites me. Just like whips and chains excites Rhianna. We were meeting some friends here for dinner and we got there very early, as we usually do. There was some sitting space upstairs (we GOT THE COUCH, SUCKAHS) and we ordered a beer and a glass of wine. I got a white wine, since that's the best drink EVER for warm weather. The interior is interesting. The wallpaper is like nothing I've ever seen - the designs on it are 'raised' from the rest of the paper...it's very unique. I really liked the space. A lot. The service was attentive and wonderful, as well. Once our friends arrived we sat down upstairs and perused the menu. We started off with pork rinds and home made pickles. Both were great. The pickles were actually a variety of pickled vegetables and not just...pickles. We enjoyed it. For our mains, I ordered the Field Green and Tatsoi salad and my husband got the fish and chips. My salad was outstanding and great for a  warm night. It was field greens, tatsoi (which I have never tried before O&E...very delicious), asparagus, carrots and daikon tossed in a miso vinaigrette. It was wonderful. My husband's fish and chips was outstanding and I would probably get that when we come back. We also got a plate of bubble and squeak for the table to share (a sweet mixture of mashed potatoes and caramelized onions....it's heaven incarnated in a food). For dessert, our friends ordered the panna cotta and we got the cheesecake with toffee crumble. Both were really outstanding, but I liked the cheesecake a little better. That's unusual for me, because I'm a total panna cotta whore. It was really great cheesecake!We will be back, most definitely. Owen & Engine delivers on all counts."
"Owen & Engine gets a lot of hype. Every bit of it well deserved. I've been twice in the last two weeks, and hot damn this place is delicious to its core. First, off the bartender Rich is a great guy and makes a mean Old Fashioned. I was a bit skeptical at first, but after my indulgence in this whiskey meets bitters delight, I was sold. O&E also features a respectable beer list; well chosen craft beers dot the draft list and you'll be able to identify some fantastic imports, especially mouth watering Belgians. And did I mention they even sport cask conditioned beers?? On my first visit I had the Bells Best Brown Ale cask goodness. The map room better wake up!!The food here is also a treat. The crumpets are to die for. Local legend has it that the pastry chef spent 3+ months perfecting the recipe. A plate of crumpets drowned in clotted cream and smeared with jam. Does it get any better? The beef hash was also incredible. Dark, rich cubes of corned beef mixed with fried potato chunks and a deep fried egg sitting a top this mountain of this goodness. Just make sure you cut into the egg early and allow all the runny yolk to immediately drown your hash. Trust me, you won't be sorry.O&E has executed the greatness about a British pub without the attitude and without the warm beer. Amen brother!"
"this place: 4 stars.my date: 1 star.  first date: we came here after watching that horrible Wizard of Oz movie back in early march (not my choice).  movie on a first date??  yeah, i should flat out said no.  but i went.  sigh.afterward, we came here.  FINALLY!  i tried coming here on my birthday a few years ago (which was a horrible day - why is it that i have come to O&E on bad days?) but it was packed to the brim.  anyway, back to the weird date.  it was 8:30, and i hadn't eaten anything since 1.  he apparently wasn't hungry.  so he watched me down my pimm's cup and the cornish pastry, which was basically awesomeness in empanada shape.  it was a big one, and, like a lady, i went town on it.  with every bite, i drowned out the awkward conversation about IT.  UGH, just because i do IT doesn't mean i want to talk about it for 2 hours.i enjoyed my meal.  not my date.  oh, and i paid for my meal and his drink.  then i threw up the deuces and peace'd the eff outta there."
"Owen & Engine makes the best fish and chips I've ever had, anywhere, in my entire life. No exaggeration. The best.Anywhere.And....Their homemade pickles are perfect.The scotch egg is top notch. The cornish pasty is pleasing.The duck meatballs with saag paneer is the stuff of dreams. Their bangers are magnificently beefy, sage-y goodness. Their draught beers are delectable and the whiskey list is wonderful.But, really, the fish and chips are perfectly paired with a pea puree and sauce gribiche. And let's not forget the malt vinegar aioli. Brilliant! Okay, so why no ""Woo-hoo?"" I could have done without the cheese plate.The bubble and squeak was neither bubbling nor squeaking by the time it arrived at our table. Not even so much as a whimper. It's bubbly, squeaky moment was long gone. And, not sure if it was the kitchen or the service, but none of our food was exactly piping hot by the time it arrived at our table. Also, and this is just my personal preference, I hate it when they box your food for you unless the person boxing the food is thoughtful enough to include any sauces which may have accompanied the dishes. Our dude was not...thoughtful. And the chutney he did toss in with the cornish pasty was just that, tossed in. Thanks, guy.All in all, though, Owen & Engine is full of delicious pub dishes, good whiskeys, beers and warmth and comfort during the all too abundant blustery Chicago evenings."
"I really, really loved the food here.  I really did.  But Chicago has tons of fancy, schmancy gastropubs popping up all over the place and I don't appreciate the snooty attitude of Owen & Engine.  I still give them three stars because the food and the beer are great, but their own vision of themselves is really irritating since there are a lot of similar places doing great things with food and drink and they're not big dicks about it.House burger + bap was yummy and definitely worth trying.  The bread pudding at the end of my meal was absolutely killer delicious, so I highly recommend it.  My friend tried the bangers + mash and loved it, so you could try that too.  Selection of beers is overwhelming, so ask your server.  They know their bar and they're happy to tell you everything they know about all the libations they're serving.  Apparently they also have some killer cocktails, so keep that in mind if you're not an ale fan.The attitude still gets me, though.  I like that their website says ""I wanted to open a British Pub in Chicago, one of those found in the pastoral countryside of Britain, where the ingredients are fresh and the atmosphere is casual.""  This place is much, much too pretentious to actually be a real pastoral British bar.  Those countryside bars are super dive-y and full of all the hillbillies that live in the middle of nowhere with livestock.  This bar is not that casual at all.  As Carol K. mentioned, they'll look at you like you're crazy if you don't have reservations.  I didn't know I needed them for a bar, but OK.  Everything is much too proper and this bar is a bit too expensive to make it a regular hangout, which is a shame since it's so close to my apartment.  We tried to go back another time and were shut down by an hour-long wait, so we'll see if we'll visit Owen & Engine in 2011 or not."
"Owen & Engine kind of blew my mind the weeknight a few weeks back when I decided on it for dinner.  Didn't expect so many options, and seriously delicious food. Had a few tremendous beers here, you can tell they pride themselves on the selection they offer.  Chose the burger for dinner, and honestly it was one of the best burgers I can remember having in the longest time.  If you are deciding whether or not it's worth the trek to get to Owen & Engine; you can start heading that way now."
"Sometimes timing is everything. My beer loving friend and I decided to check out Owen and Engine the other night to relax in a place that wasn't still ""Decked to the Halls"" or full of fake holiday cheer. We arrived without a reservation (get one or they look at you like you have two heads) and were told that there would be a 30 minute wait. Since there was no where to sit at the smallish bar, we were just starting to carve out a standing spot when the host came back and said he had a table ready. Score! The interior of this bar has been designed to look like a British pub. Lovely, dark oak, divided pane windows line the one wall, old fashioned ceiling fixtures light the place and the tables are cafe style, dark and cozy. Even the bathrooms are nice with flocked wallpaper and old style fixtures. The seating issue solved- we were now on to the more pressing issue of getting someone to wait on us. Finally (we were almost to the point of going up to the bar ourselves to get a drink) the server made her way over and asked for our beer order. My friend always likes to see if the people working in these kinds of places know their stuff- so he quizzed her on a couple of her suggestions and she passed with flying colors (yay!) so both of her recommendations on our descriptions of what we wanted were spot on! I had the BitBurger Pilsner and my friend had a Three Floyds Robert the Bruce cask ale. Beers in hand- we were now able to check out the menu and order some appetizers and entrees. We started with the oysters (kumamotos on the night we were there) and the chacuterie plate. Both were great with the chacuterie plate coming with a couple of meats, a pate, and some kind of a pulled pork served over something like an apple sauce. Perfect, and the crackers and bread they served with it was also spot on. While we had asked the server to put all of our food in at the same time (we were trying to catch a movie across the street) she didn't, so there was a bit of a pause between the appetizers and the entrees. That would have been nice to sit and linger if we hadn't specifically asked for it to be done another way. Oh well- the entrees came up and they were quite good as well. I had the highly touted fish and chips and my friend had the bangers and mash. Both were definitely better than my expectations, as we all know the Brits are not known for their gourmet food! While the entrees are not expensive ($15 -$20) the appetizers are in the same range so dinner for two with 2 beers ran about $80. Street parking is a bit of a challenge but if all else fails- you can park in the movie theater garage across the street for only $2! (a deal) Plenty of ""Gastropubs"" popping up in the city right now- easy to spot as they all have an ampersand (&) in their name. Owen & Engine is doing a great job with the food and ambiance. They just need to work on a consistent level of service . . .and coach the host that not having a reservation is not the end of the world!"
"I went here for the first time recently and was very impressed. My friend and I got there before 6 on a Tuesday night, so it wasn't crowded at all. To drink, I had an amazing gin and tonic--not a hard drink to make, and yet so many of them aren't that great. We split the farm egg custard appetizer, which was truly amazing. I easily could have eaten about 5 of these. For my entree, I had the snapper, which was also very tasty, but perhaps not quite as great as the appetizer. My friend ordered the burger, which she said was quite good as well. We skipped dessert, so I can't comment on that. Based on this experience, I'm eager to return here soon!"
"Bone marrow is amazing, same with the fish and chips;  well really everything here is amazing. Love the fact that they let you sample as much beer as you want too ;-)"
"This place is worth a visit. Went here on Tuesday night for their burger special. $16 dollars for: House burger, large amount of fries, pint of beer and a shot of bourbon. The bacon, fried egg, and  cheese add ons to the burger were extra dollars but were excellent additions to the meal. Very much recommended that you try out this burger if, like me, you are a burger enthusiast. My friends had other dishes. One had the fish and chips and enjoyed it very much. I will be back to try out other dishes on the menu here. Good value, good taste, fun ambience."
"I love Owen & Engine.  Love, love, love. I've had about every staple menu item a few times, but I crave the burger with aged cheddar!  It is the best in the City.  No condiments needed.  Do yourself a favor and order it.   O&E also has a great drinks menu with a fantastic selection of craft beers, cocktails, bourbon and whisky.  The atmosphere is cozy with dark wood and if you're lucky enough to snag a seat upstairs by the fireplace, you might stay forever.  I went here about once a week this winter (sometimes twice) and loved it every time.  O&E, if you are reading this, you must put the roasted chicken with truffle spaetzle back on the menu! It was delicious."
"This place was phenomenal! My husband and I went here for dinner last night with another couple. The location is a little odd, but I won't hold that against them. It happened to be Craft Beer Week, so there was a bunch of specials in addition to the regular menu. Be sure to make a reservation... luckily we had one and we saw a few people getting turned away at the door because they were solidly booked for the night.We started off dinner with the New Belgium Lips of Faith 10/10/10 beer, which they had just tapped that day. Wow. So refreshing. And only $6 for the glass! All the beer prices seemed incredibly reasonable and there were lots of rare craft brew options.Then on to appetizers, where we tried the Eggplant Chips from the specials menu and the Peanuts from the regular menu. The Eggplant Chips were fried sections of eggplant served with tzatziki sauce. They were good, but nothing mind blowing. The peanuts, however, were another story. They were coated in sriracha, worcestershire, brown sugar for a sweet and spicy flavor all at once. You MUST try them! Our friends shared the Risotto, which looked delicious with lots of fresh asparagus and peas. I'd like to try that the next time I'm there.For the main course, I got the Duck L'Orange from the specials menu, my husband and his friend got the Fish and Chips, and our other friend got the Chicken. We were all pleasantly surprised at the quality of the dishes. This was way more than your average pub. The Duck was the best I've ever had, with a crispy skin and wild rice and brussel sprouts on the side. It was perfectly prepared, and not at all greasy or fatty, like many ducks I've had before.For dessert, the four of us shared the Ice Cream Sandwich because we saw several being served around us and it looked amazing. Let me just say that it was SO GOOD. They packed a lot of flavors into a little ice cream sandwich! I could've licked the plate.Overall, this was a solid restaurant that I would definitely visit again."
"We had a work dinner here and it was a lovely spot for it! This place is designed like a genuine British pub - and I mean really genuine, not the ""genuine"" ones you find on every street corner in downtown London (which, btw, are mostly owned by the same chain company). It has a beautiful and cozy upstairs bar and lounge, including a little private room/nook, which is where our party was seated.They have a great beer list - lots of local craft brews plus some Europeans - and the menu is short but it has a good amount of options. Definitely heavy on the British pub traditional meats, breads, and cheeses so if you're a vegan I'd recommend elsewhere ;-) We tried most of the things on the menu and everything was great - my favorites were the scotch egg, cheese board, and the french fries that came with my fish and chips (perfectly fried and salted!). If you're in the mood for upscale British fare I'd definitely check it out."
"holy shizzle these were the best fish and chips I've ever had! The cod was falling apart on my fork and seasoned perfectly. I also had the cauliflower soup, which I wish I could eat a bucket of this stuff. Will definitely come back!"
"I liked Owen & Engine for the most part. The whole place was done up nicely.Almost too nicely for two buddies out of a beer after a bike ride. You're better off coming here with a fat wallet and a date.We had the Thursday evening special for scallops and a taster of beer for $15. Not bad, but 3 tiny scallops and 1 tiny beer still left us wanting more.I ordered the pork rillettes, pretty much pork puree. Not bad, somewhat salty with even saltier flatbread which was about as fragile as an eggshell. I still had a lot rillettes left over after finishing the bread, however.Owen & Engine is definitely for the well-heeled crowd. Small menu, craft beers, and expensive, complicated cocktails complete the modern Victorian interior. I liked the location, since for once something nice exists somewhere that isn't in a yuppie enclave. Yet Owen & Engine could be far better than an overpriced snack bar by expanding their menu. They also could get the waiters to actually dress slightly better than they did...it's rather ironic to sit in a neo-Victorian restaurant eating pricey delicacies, all while being served by some dude in a t-shirt, jeans and scruffy beard."
"We stopped in for dinner this evening.  I ordered the fish and chips, my fiancé ordered the bangers and mash.  Both entrees came out lukewarm as if they had been sitting in the kitchen for awhile so we were very disappointed.  The chips (fries) were little broken pieces from the bottom oft he basket.  We won't be back."
"This is quickly becoming one of my favorite go-to places. Owen & Engine has everything right... starting with the food. All of their ingredients are fresh and come from artisans or small business farmers. Some of my favorites include the Scotch Egg and Cornish Pasty. Now onto drink... the beer selection here is one for those who really appreciate beer. The selection is very carefully thought out. The bartenders are also very skilled mixologists and they have some very interesting house cocktails as well. I often find myself wanting to sit at the bar just to watch them. The bartenders are also very friendly and easy to strike up a conversation with. Lastly, I love, love, love the decor and atmosphere here. The design on the coasters, menu, and wallpaper is all well thought... candle light, antiques... just fabulous."
"Generally excellent high-end English pub food made with highest quality ingredients. Excellent, friendly, welcoming service. Strong beer list, including four casks.Recommended."
"Wowzer!  Where to begin?  I'll keep it short and sweet.  The bartenders are AMAZING!  The drinks and beer are wonderful, the burger and fish and chips are to die for, the egg sandwich is great but go with the burger or fish and chips.  Do get the pickled veggies in a jar, it was really great and different.The interior was GORGEOUS!  I really felt like I was transplanted to England. So warm and comfy, I loved it and can't wait to go back."
So I live in the area and i've been meaning to come here since it opened.First off:  The decor is beautiful.  I didn't make my way upstairs but the downstairs was decorated well.  It really does feel like an upscale neighborhood pub that is immaculately clean; which I guess is not very pub like.  Very homey and cozy; but not to the point that it feels like a cottage.Service:  Our waiter was very energetic and knowledgeable.  You could tell he was a firm believer in the kitchen staff and the quality of food presented.  My only small qualm is that he listed out all the specials and it took a while.  MIght be better to explain it as people ask about the various dishes.  I was kinda a pain in the ass and he was very accommodating.  Sometimes I feel like I'm secretly testing people haha.Food:  Menu was a little daunting.  I went to London twice; but I was still confused by a lot of the menu items.  That's a good thing.  Unfamiliar is good.  Rashers is bacon.  Bubble and squeak is shallow fried odds and ends of vegetables.  Scottish pancakes are pretty similar to American pancakes and delicious btw.  English fry up meant an English breakfast (fan-fucking-tastic toast. egg. baked beans. potato hash. bacon. stewed tomato. sausage. blood sausage)  Bangers are sausages and I forgot what was in the Ploughman's lunch.  Though I remember it being a hearty assortment of layman foods.  I thought everything I tried was pretty spot on.  The bread in particular I found to be alarmingly good.  Not too often that bread leaves me wanting more.  Value:  Everything is made in house except the blood sausage.  Everything is broken down and prepped in house.  The food has some pretty solid quality credentials.  That being said...the prices are a little high to warrant that. I personally found it towards the the slightly pricy side. but overall not too terrible.  My english breakfast was certainly filling and overall the food is hearty and filling although the portions are not American gargantuan.I would love to come back just to drink in the late evening.  Pretend like I'm depressed over something and huddling away from the harsh Chicago cold.
"The place was small and had a very limited menu. We were surprised that in a Friday in lent they ran out of fish. In addition,y wide ordered Chardonnay which was gross, followed by a Savigion Blanc which wasn't good either. The service was polite but incredibly slow. I will not return to this place."
"Ever so often, the stars just seem to align and you have a dining experience that is exciting, unexpectedly remarkable and leaves you dying to return for your next meal. And so it was last Thursday night at the beautiful new British gastropub Owen and Engine. With such a huge selection of beers (on tap, bottled and cask conditioned), we immediately began our evening with one of the latter - the Robert Bruce Scottish beer = excellent choice! O&E serves a rotating selection of cask beers served from their cask cellar on hand-pumped engines. FYI - for the uninitiated (i.e., us), cask beers are traditionally served at a cellar temp and have a lower carbonation than bottled or draft beers.Right up front I am going to tell you that I DIE for fish and chips and British pub food in general. Having spent a university semester abroad in England and being the Anglophile that I am, I have pretty high standards for this fare. So when I tell you that the fish and chips is one of the best in the city, I mean it.Haddock!  ""Freshly flown in daily,"" per our lovely and fabulously attentive server Emily. Now, I have a hard time believing it is daily (vs a few times per week, etc.) but I am trusting her. When I lived in England, it was Haddock, Cod or Plaice - the former being my fave and the latter being my 2nd fave. Oh Haddock...tender, moist, flavorful, served with out of this world chips (w/housemade catsup) over a dab of a fresh pea puree. Delicious!The fish and chips is also served with a fabulous malt vinegar aioli - just bathe me in the bloody stuff. Wow! Known in my social circle as Mrs. Potatohead, I also ordered a side of Cheddar Mash - scrumptious.My beloved died over the ham hocks soup with braised kale and cannellini beans but was quickly resuscitated with O & E's exquisite housemade sausages & charcuterie w/pickles & mustard. FYI - In the middle of the soup bowl was some cannellini bean puree and when Emily poured that broth over the puree causing it to ""melt"" into the soup, I thought my beloved would melt onto the floor. The service was spot on and so accommodating. Server Emily showed us around the restaurant taking us up to the comfy 2nd flr (replete with a fireplace), and she also brought us a number of beer tasters throughout the evening which we greatly appreciated.We can barely wait to come back to try brunch - tea, crumpets, bubble and squeak, housemade bacon, Scottish pancakes, scones - wait - HOMEMADE CLOTTED CREAM? I am so there."
"This is one of the best burger & beer combinations I have had.  A few workmates and I trudged along the rainy avenues of Chicago to take a taste of good British pub food that had been a small mention in an aged Chicago magazine write-up.  We were not disappointed.  The scotch egg is a good appetizer and who doesn't like a fried whole egg?  My angus burger topped with fried onions and fried egg caused a combination of taste of meaty protein burger, grease, and an omelet.  Outstanding!The beer variety is wide and I enjoy a good British beer on tap.  'Chips' are fries to us and lightly salted and tasted with malted vinegar.  All a really good night.My colleagues had the fish-and-chips and while they thought the meal tasted fine, it was just a bit off of a 5 star rating.Service is friendly and on this weeknight there were plenty of locals to give it character.  We were in suits and those around us were a bit of the large tattoo crowd - but nobody cares because we are all drinking beers, eating good food, and enjoying what could be a British version of  'Cheers'."
"Ok so I am giving a one star review because I never ended up staying. I walk in and was ""greeted"" by the host who for whatever reason had an attitude to as why I was there. I asked if we could sit at a table if we were only going to have a drink he said the bar would be best....No one was in the place except two older ladies in the corner....The host also said they have a lounge upstairs. Well after going out to get my bf and coming in we decided to go upstairs in the lounge...well he walked right past us as I asked where we could sit and he just flailed his arm in dismissive way as to point to anywhere. We both looked at each other and decided to leave. its a shame because I have heard good things about this place and have been wanting to try for a long time. We really felt like we were not welcomed....not sure why."
"This place is more of a 4.5 star place, but for what it's trying to be and how it executes I have no problem giving it 5 stars. It's an old style English pub and the decor definitely gives that feel with a lot of wood and a fantastic lounge area upstairs complete with leather sofas and a fireplace.  Their beer list was expansive and should appease most connoisseurs....they even had some of the limited release BCBS from Goose Island in their cellar!  We sat at the bar downstairs (before we realized they had the great upstairs) and the our 2 bartenders were attentive, very friendly and knowledgeable.  To top it all off I ordered the burger and ending up having what I consider to be the best burger I've ever had, and I've been to Kuma's, Bad Apple and Longman & Eagle.  They use a 40/30/30 combination of ground beef/short ribs/brisket which was absolutely melt in your mouth divine, topped with a 2 year aged cheddar, homemade bun, spectacular fries and a side of vinegar aioli.  I was blown away. It was a bit expensive for a burger but the experience was worth every penny, AND they do a special burger night on Tuesdays with $15 for a burger, beer and a shot.  I will be going back, frequently. Cheers!"
"We thought that this place had to be worth checking out when we got an email from our friend Scott lauding it's glory.  Ya see, Scotty's not the type of guy to recommend a place and he went completely out of his way to draft a late night email about it.  When we woke up this morning we felt as if we may make better use of our time by brunching rather than going to the gym so we ended up giving E&O a shot instead.  Um, wow.  Just wow.  Their scones were amazing and the rest of their menu took English, Irish, and Scottish classics and make them tasty.  The decor is warm and the staff is incredibly friendly.  I had an awesome quiche and the hubby got the eggs bendict which were amazing.  They change their quiches based on what's fresh which always makes for better food but an inconsistent menu.  If you check their menus online make sure to give them a call to check on the menu for the day because it changes sometimes daily.  Adam's benedict had fresh eggs and was peppered well.  It complemented his homemade bloody mary perfectly as well.  They make everything fresh, in house, including their bacons and butters, which are made from ricotta and is outstanding!This place is not to be missed!!  We can't wait to go there for dinner!!"
"Nice Ambiance, though bar staff definitely on the scruffy side.  Burger was very solid, though I don't really understand the other reviews that claimed it was the best burger in the city.  My friend had the chicken thigh sandwich which was interesting to try....lots going on there, flavor wise.  We also had the pretzel with stout mustard sauce which was quite tasty.  They had a delicious sounding blueberry pie on the dessert menu but we were so stuffed from the appetizer and entree that we didn't have room.  They also have a nice selection of wine and beer to choose from."
"Took a very mixed groupon of 15 people here for my husband's birthday. The food and service were outstanding. There was something for everyone and our waiter was great at explaining to us middle Americans Britishicisms like ""Bubble and Squeak"". (Delicious, by the by.)Then, in my (drunken?) haze, I overtipped...by like an extra $100 because I was so worried about making sure everyone in the party had put in enough I flaked and didn't realize tip was included - the waiter took me aside and very politely asked if I meant to do that. Well, I hadn't, but...I split the difference with him because he was so awesome about it. We went back just a few weeks later to do their Tuesday night deal - $15 for a beer, bourbon, and burger. As if I weren't in love enough already. The burger is fantastic - the potato bap (bun) was so good and the bourbon was Knob Creek. We'll be back. Regularly, no doubt. Much to the dismay of my pant-size."
"Without a doubt, one of the best burgers Brian and I have ever had. The meat is the best quality."
"Hanging with a friend on a Saturday night we had no plans and an appetite for something new, at least to us. We seen the positive reviews for Owen & Engine and decided to give them a shot. And let me say was it a pleasant experience all around. Walking in to the exquisitely decorated old english style pub. Heavy dark woods luxurious fabrics and wallpaper that just begged for petting, even our server asked if we ""felt the wall"". The decor and design was consistent all the way down to the menu's. This displayed a level of detail before we even opened the menu that impressed. While very well appointed, the atmosphere was pleasantly casual, warm, inviting, and unpretentious. Starting with drinks, my friend ordered the ""Sage Advice"" a refreshing Gin cocktail with hints of lemon, ginger & sage. I took a taste and was delighted at how refreshing it was. I ordered up the ""Flores Blanco"" Mezcal, St. Germain, lemon, egg white, and black pepper, and was equally pleased. During dinner we switched up to the Pimms cup, she trying the ""O&E"" and I the ""Victorian"". The drinks were exceptional, great tasting and they delivered a happy buzz!For dinner we wanted to try a few different things, so we started with the ""Scotch Egg"", for the uninformed which i was before this dinner, it's an egg wrapped in sausage meat, battered and fried. My friend hit the Nail on the head when she said ""This is what a sausage McMuffin aspires to"". Why would you want an appetizer that tastes like a sausage McMuffin? Just eat it and then you'll understand. Absolutely worth the try. Then onto the ""Escargot in Bone Marrow"", Escargot in buttery Bone Marrow that  delivered as well. Some restaurants use this as an impressive novelty on their menu, here it had a purpose, and was well executed. We finished off with the ""Bangers and Mash"", looking like a well presented version of the british gastro-pub classic. The Taste far exceeded any version of the dish I've tried before. The Sausages were tender, and the meat melt in your mouth. The mash was freaking awesome, we ended up taking home a side for a friend. An aged cheddar cheese mashed potato that was out of this world . The side we took home was actually from the late night menu, it was toped with a sunny side egg. This was an exceptional experience, Our server Ryan was extremely personable and friendly, explained the dishes well and offered some great suggestions. He was clearly invested in this place, as an employer myself , that is rare and speaks volumes. When your staff is passionate and excited about the place then everything else seems to fall in line.Owen & Engine more than met expectations, it delivered on all fronts. Be it a date or casual dinner, this is a great place."
"I've been itching to go here for a long time, and tonight was finally the night. Maybe my expectations were too high. I understood straight off the bat that the prices were a little higher than you'd expect in a gastropub, and I was okay with that. But by the end of the meal, I was less okay with it. I mean, seriously. $14 for a decent burger with only caramelized onions and no cheese? You've got to be kidding me.The atmosphere is great. Very authentic English pubby. They also carry this amazing French cider that I love, and I ordered it despite the $22 price tag. You heard me. I have to say I was pretty shocked it was so expensive, especially when you can get it elsewhere in the city for a LOT less. I must note though, while it was $22 on the menu, it was only $15 on the bill. Not that I was upset, but the discrepancy was confusing.We got the charcuterie platter and the quail for small plates. The charcuterie was decent. Nothing ground breaking. The quail was definitely the star of the show. Crispy skin, perfectly seasoned, delicious bed of kale, and the little soft boiled fried egg was flavorful and perfectly cooked. Amazing. My burger was fine. Cooked to requested temp. Not life changing. My lovely dinner partner said that her fish n chips were good. Dessert. We both got the sticky toffee pudding. It was less than impressive. Between the fact that we've both lived in England and the fact that I work in pastry- it just didn't do it for us. The cake was a little dry and had a thick crust on the top- not how authentic sticky toffee pudding is supposed to be. It's supposed to be more bread pudding-y and spongy. The caramel was interesting though. Pretty positive it's made with buttermilk. Overall, a decent meal, but I have to say I'm not in a hurry to go back. Oh, by the way, do yourself a favor, make a reservation. Or you're screwed."
"I have heard a lot of complaints about consistency here, but I guess we got lucky as everything seemed pretty spot on.  The only complaint was our server who between his skinny jeans, intermittent service and assumptions about our order and plans for the night became the only real flaw in the meal.We opened with a Scottish egg, which is an egg wrapped in sausage and the fried.  It is quite fun to cut that open and see the egg yolk spill out.  Quite tasty as well, though the sausage on the exterior could have used a bit more flavor.  Thankfully, their stout brown mustard can pick up the slack; that stuff in wonderful.Then we had the Amish wings which hold a very mild spice in the sauce and the dish is served with the mild creme fraiche.  So not terrible, but not exceptional either with places like Crisp around.I keep getting charcuterie plates and while I have never disliked one I have also never really eaten one worth raving about.  Owen and Engine's does nothing to change that, despite being quite good, but a tad pricey for what you get.  Highlight was the reappearance of the stout brown mustard.Lastly, we had to try the fish and chips.  Not a fan of how they put them in pea puree or placing the tartar sauce directly on them; both are a good way to get them soggy.  Similarly, I recommend dumping your chips out to make sure they don't get soggy in their paper.  That said, the fish while it was hot was EXCELLENT.  I can only think of one place with better fried fish and it was of a heavier batter.  However, the star, for me, were the chips which were good enough to eat without condiments, though a perfectly fine malt vinegar aoli is served with them.My true complaint is how shallow the menu is.  If I came back the only new thing I would try would be the burger that everyone raves about.  Also the prices are a bit high for gastropub food, but the fish and chips are worth it."
"I've wanted to come here for months and finally got the chance for a two-months-late birthday dinner with the in-laws.  The place (like most others mention) is seriosuly awesome and oozes with British awesomeness.  It's dark and fancy and lovely (British people say things like ""lovely"", right?)The drinks took a little bit but they made me a fabulous Dark and Stormy and had an impressive beer list that the husband took advantage of.  Some of the 9%+ beers had me a little scared so I stuck with my drink.  We started with two scotch eggs, perfectly cooked eggs and crispy shells with delightfully tangy mustard.  Yum.  I was going to be adventurous and get the bone marrow but I couldn't pass up the fish and chips so I caved.  Husband got the ribeye, mom got the Cornish Pasty and dad got the salt beef sandwich.  Everyone was raving about their meals and not a complaint was heard.We got both the bannoffee and sticky bread pudding for desserts and bannoffee was definitely the winner.  Dad already wants to come back, seeing as it was pretty reasonably priced, a little bit different and parking is super easy.  Key for the suburban parents!   Love this place."
"Long drive from the edge of civilization in the Fox Valley, but worth it. Great burgers, comfy place, adequate service.. Good selection of beer and some fancy cocktails. Convenient parking across the street in a garage for $2. That all adds up as a winner for me.TIP: Make it a night with a movie across the street and you can save the $2 parking charge!"
"I have to say, this place is a little random.  I mean, Chicago is no stranger to excellent restaurants in janky locations (*cough* Publican, *cough* Bonsoiree) but this one is pretty dang janky.  Don't get me wrong, I live right in the neighborhood, but it is a bit unexpected.That being said, its a very pleasant oasis of ultimate civility in the middle of a somewhat seedy strip of Western.  The decor is absolutely spot on.  While we were waiting to be seated (we didn't wait long, even though the place looked packed) I couldn't get over just how perfect all the details were.  The marble tile floor in the vestibule, the wood paneling, the finishes, everything just shouted ""I'm an authentic british pub!!!!"" except for the giant flat screens playing some sporting event or other, that's pretty ""city of big shoulders"".The food was great, the burger was very tasty, as was the charcuterie plate.  I found my beverage (a Pimm's Cup variation) to be a bit off, but BF's drink (had some crazy weird name, I forget at the moment) was totes delish.Our server was a bit meh; he gave us some BS explanation about why all the ""chips"" we got were tiny  (as in 75% of our fries [sorry, chips] were less than an inch long) he said ""they're cut the traditional way that chips are cut, that's just what happens"".  Whatevs.  We got the bottom of the chip barrel, its fine, they were still tasty.One thing I have to comment, being a stickler, is that on one place on the menu, a dish included ""rocket"" whereas another dish included ""arugula.""  They would have gotten props for consistently using the word ""rocket.""  I pointed this out to BF, he just half smiled and changed the subject.  Later I realized that he had NO IDEA what I was talking about, so for those of you who don't get it, there is a salad green called ""arugula"" in America.  In Italy they call it ""rucola.""  In the UK they call it ""rocket.""  In France, its ""roquette.""  Class dismissed."
"Burger, Beer, and Bourbon night is the best!  The burger was cooked and seasoned perfectly, tender and flavorful.  The caramelized onions on top were really all you need--pure excellence as is.  The addition of a beer and a shot of bourbon led to a very fun and decadent Tuesday night.  It was one of the best burgers I've had in the city."
"Shoe shopping always makes me hungry. On a Sunday afternoon, a friend and I went shoe shopping for me. I needed some killer shoes to match an equally killer dress. After acquiring the hottest, garnet red patent leather pumps ever, we were starving. My friend mentioned Owen and Engine immediately. I was excited for this new English pub in Bucktown/Logan Square. We were seated quickly and given plenty of time to check out the menu. We ordered drinks for our Sunday post-shoe shopping brunch. They have a great selection of beers on tap and a cool cocktail menu. I did their Pimm's cup cocktail and loved it instantly. For brunch, I had their play on Eggs Benedict, my go-to brunch selection. I ate up my Eggs Benedict right away! It was so delicious and filling. After we finished our brunch entrees, we lingered and drank more cocktails. It became a bit of a boozy brunch for us. Our server was extremely attentive and made sure we were never without any empty glass. Before leaving, I checked out their velvet damask walled bathroom. Yes, I pet the wallpaper! All in all, Owen & Engine is fantastic. It's a great English pub in Logan Square."
"The idea to come to this British style pub was my friend's idea after debating where to get a burger. He had been here before and really liked the place. It was a Tuesday night and the place was pretty busy, so we went right to the bar. The bar was the busiest place to go actually and it seemed like the bartender was really busy. His friend, from what I assume by the way they talked they were friends. I had the Belhaven Scottish ale which was a little sweet and malty which was a nice, tasty complement to the pub atmosphere. As a started we got the rillettes, I wanted the pork rinds to compare them to the Publicans but my friend wasn't in the mood. However, the pate was pretty tasty with the pickles adding a nice sweet/tangy combination and the flat bread was soft and warm.We both got the burgers which came with onions, but we both got the Stilton cheese-imported from England they said and rashers which like a fresh bacon cut from the loin and not the belly-which was brined in-house. They were both good additions to the burger-for a second I thought the cheese would be incredibly overpowering but it turned out to be a little nutty and a creamy texture. The rascher wasn't overly salty, either but actually a little sweet. Overall, I had a good experience food wise and service wise when it clicked was really good as well."
"Lovely.My friend and I met a group of three already at the bar.  It must have been some time between 11 and midnight (it was just last night but I'm bad with numbers, sorry).  Although my friend and I came in so late, I didn't feel rushed.  The bartenders are very attentive and friendly.  The Kentucky Blackhawk (Buffalo Trace, Lime, Sloe Gin, Rosemary Thyme Syrup) was exquisite!  Smooth, not too sweet, perfect.  I took a recommendation for a rye from the bartender (don't remember which one :/ sorry) on ice which was also delicious.It seems the staff are also wonderful conversationalists.  I spoke with the sous chef, Jake, about the kind of food used.  I am thrilled to find a place I can get a drink, quality food, sensible decor and be served by such affable staff at the same time.Next visit I will definitely try out the food menu.  Thanks for a great night, guys!"
"The ambiance tries very hard to mimic an iconic pub experience, with some success, though, given the price point- one would expect a setting more Buckingham than back-alley Brighton.  The scotch egg was a highlight, lovely golden crust, the yolk just soft and creamy.  A pretzel served with a delicious (though very unappetizing grey) gravy with chunks of cheese (Rarebit--not nearly as exciting as the name would imply).   The bone marrow & escargot was over breaded- the escargot were so flavorless and amorphous I was sure they had forgotten to add them to plate. We also sampled the Amish Chicken Wings--which were good, drenched in a rich, spicy mole--but I couldn't help but feel that they were completely out of place.The all-important cocktail menu had interest to spare- clever sounding combinations that either came on too strong, or one in particular that completely eschewed herbal and landed in Pinesol territory.When we sat down, the waitress immediately informed us there was only order of Fish & Chips remaining- which seems odd, given that it was fairly early on a Saturday evening and it's meant to be their signature- frankly, they could have kept it in the kitchen. For $17, the two lonely pieces of haddock where crisp, but under seasoned and bland.  Meanwhile, the Ribeye steak was a seared salt lick.  The ""filet"" featured huge globulous  lumps of fat, circled in untrimed gristle. It was tender, and the flavor good if you could ignore the way your mouth seemed to be curing itself with every bite. The chewy, overly large Yorkshire pudding- think a popover with no butter- only highlighted how unbalanced the whole mess was.  The pinesol did act as a pallet cleanser...That brings me to the bill: I'll grant you- we ordered 4 apps, 4 entrees, and drinks- but the bill came to a whooping $300 for 4. My money would have been better spent on a flight to London."
"Being that I'm a movie buff and the movie theatre across the street from Owen & Engine is the easiest mainstream theater for me to get to I find myself in the neighborhood on the regular. Because of that I've always wanted a good place to go get a drink or a bite to eat before or after a film. Sure, Fat Willy's is there and it's got some tasty treats but the wait can be insane and sometimes I'm just not in the mood for BBQ. There are some other really great places in the neighborhood but if the weather is crappy or you just don't feel like walking your options are limited to ribs, a hot dog at the theater, or the BK across the street. And while a flame broiled whopper can quell hunger pains just fine I'm usually up for something a little more interesting. Luckily for me Owen & Engine has arrived! I popped in with some friends post a viewing of The Social Network on Saturday night for a drink and fell in love right away. The space is warm and inviting. Comfortable seating both downstairs and upstairs. Upstairs has some casual seating positioned around what one may call a roaring fireplace which will be perfect in the coming winter months. Even the menus are aesthetically pleasing (a nice floral wallpaper print on the cover). The beer list is awesome--a lot of my favorite Midwest brews on tap made me a happy lady (Bell's, Great Lakes Brewing Co., Founders, etc). Not to mention some quality imported brews bottled for your pleasure. Reasonably priced ($5 for a pint of Bell's Brown Ale) and poured nice and cold. The perfect nightcap to a quality evening at the cinema!If I recall correctly the wine list has few by the glass options--it's an entire bottle or one or two choices for just a glass. Drink mix-ins are few and far between (it's soda or nothing. No juices) but it's a English pub, not a martini bar so if you want an appletini or a vodka cranberry might I suggest you try somewhere else? Those looking for nonalcoholic options can get a ginger beer, soda or some coffee or tea. They have a quite a tea offering-- even at 2:30am! Our waitress was awesome. Really personable and attentive. Checked in on us quite a bit without being annoying and was extremely helpful when I was on the fence between two beers. She gave us the run down on when they opened and some menu tips. We weren't hungry so I can't comment on the food since I didn't order any (I think that's why I'm apt to give it 4 stars instead of 5 since I haven't sampled any of their edible offerings) but the menu looked quite tasty and I'm looking forward to popping in here some day for some fish and chips or a crumpet."
"Between living in London for a while and travelling back a few times, I can say I've been in my fair share of English pubs. The first thing I noticed after entering was the sparkling room  with polished wood, lots and lots of windows and tables set for dinner service. This hasn't typically been my experience in English pubs. The first floor is a little stark, but the hidden gem is the upstairs lounge. After a drink at the bar (nice beer list) , we were escorted upstairs to the warmer, cozier second floor. There was a roaring fire, with couch and chairs set in front and along the walls, comfortable tables and chairs. There's also a second bar. The floor, with the oriental rugs was more reminiscent of the many carpeted pubs I frequented in ol' Blighty (minus the decades old layer of smoke).The service was stellar, swift and very friendly. We ordered the fish and chips, a side of seasonal veg and the cheddar mash. Everything was absolutely scrumptious.The dinner menu's a little expensive, but the pub and brunch menu are a little less pricey. I'd definitely like to go back to test the crumble."
"It was still brunch time but I had the burger. Either the best or second best I've had in years. Cooked exactly as I ordered it, very thick on a toasted bun with caramelized onions. Enough onions to taste rather than just see. The meat had a few spots of intense salt flavor but was not salty over all. My wife had the Swedish pancakes and was very happy with them."
"yes indeed I am a fan. This is a really good pub, with really good beer, and really good grub. The staff was knowledgable, and pleasant. My wife had been there after they had first opened, and did not have a good time, she said it was light years better this time. I would go back for sure.Get the Cornish Pasty & Pickle jar growing up on these things I am not very forgiving; this was the real deal.GOOD all around, better than most of it's kind."
"Had heard some great things about this place from a friend who is English. So I decided to try it for myself. First off, it's a great neighborhood place. (a great place were where you dont have to pay an arm and a leg for parking). But really, it it actually in Logan Square? I think it's on the border. Nonetheless, it's easy to get to. Secondly, reservations were easy to get on a Saturday evening @ 8:00pm for 4 people. (score!) Lastly, service is friendly and food and drinkis great!"
Great Beer Selection!The four of us ordered different entrees and sampled each entree..each lived up to it's reputation.  The best was the rib eye with a side order of the mash (Bubble & Squek my fav).Our waitress was great and very helpful in going through the beer list.  Definitely would come back though to try their Brunch menu!
"My quest for the best burger in Chicago came to a screeching halt at this place.  Don't expect creative or fancy toppings.  There's just something about the meat and the bun that they use that makes this the best I've ever had, and by a very wide margin.  It's perfect.  The rest of their menu looks amazing too but I'll never be able to speak to it.  You couldn't pay me to go there and not get their burger.  Beer and cocktail snobs (like me) will love it also.  Ask to be seated upstairs; better atmosphere IMO."
"Not a fan of english food. Nothing we got there was worth bragging about. Its close to the highway-yay for convenience! Hmm the service was ok too not the best. But overall environment is nice. Very traditional english pub like, but maybe im just not a huge fan."
"This place is a little swanky for me.  It should really have two and half dollar signs especially because if you go here you're going to have to try some of the sweet beers they have on tap.  Don't get me wrong, I like this place, I just prefer a little bit more laid back vibe in a bar.P.S.  If you're trying to impress the man in your life and they have any inclination towards being into beer - BRING THEM HERE.  I swear there is like man cat-nip in the wallpaper in this joint.  They love it!"
"Chips, are just regular fries. I know that makes sense for this restaurant. But sorta a bummer, to just get regular fries & not ""chips""Our server was AWESOME! (A man, didn't get his name)If you like beer, you should go here.Prices are high for the portion."
"Perfect way to warm up on this super cold night...their Tuesday night special: $15 for a house burger, hand cut fries, a pint of amber ale and a shot of bourbon...mmm mmmm..."
Pretty average tuna melt sandwich. The decor is nice though.
"The Gastropub scene is one of my favorite places to visit. Great food, cool people, fantastic beer and cocktails, and usually some cool decor. Owen and Engine is one of my favorites. I love everything from the sign above the door, to the pestle they use to breakdown my orange  and sugar for my old fashioned. Their decor is really cool. Mixed furniture that looks of good quality, a multitude of different rooms, and an upstairs and downstairs. Their old fashioned is hands down my personal favorites, the garnish of a brandied cherry is a nice touch. They have a superb beer selection too. Lots of nice choices on draft or by bottle. Their food is great. Nice presentation, most pair well with their drinks, Excellent selection of charcruterie and cheese. Plus the pairings they provide are a nice complement. The pork rillette was also really good. The Slagel farm meatballs are really good too. Their bone marrow is great, rich and generous portion.Their chicken wings were nice as well, I loved the chive creme friache. The fish and chips are perfect. The pea puree they serve with it is heavinly. Owen and Engine rocks! I gotta get back so I can try their Clam Choweder and other great products, plus I their brunch looks worth a go (or 20)."
"we went here recently for my husband's birthday, and like all hipster-esque places in logan square, we were whisked away to a darkened corner so as not to ruin the ambience or hipster atmosphere. not a big deal, though. it was a sunday night, pretty early, so we were lucky to not have a hugely crowded restaurant/bar to deal with. i love the vibe and the layout - upstairs there is a fireplace, another full bar and some high backed leather armchairs in addition to dining tables. very masterpiece theater. we had the roasted olives appetizer, and it was amazing. definitely going to attempt to recreate at home. we also had a couple of beverages - my wine was delicious as well. for dinner, i had the mussels, which are served in an amazing broth with leeks and fresh tomatoes. the ingredients were well-seasoned (some might say a little on the salty side, but i LOVE salt) and very fresh. my husband's veggie-based stew was also quite good - we both gobbled up every last bite and had to turn down the offer of dessert. i would definitely go back, but i think i would be more intrigued by the ambience on a weekend night - maybe have a drink at the bar instead of full on dinner. great food AND service, though!"
"I haven't had every burger in the world, but of the hundreds of burgers I have had the pleasure of consuming over my lifetime, the top two are:1. Owen & Engine's old burger (before they changed the beef sourcing).2. Owen & Engine's new burger.Everything else is just vying for a distant third place (which happens to belong to Minetta Tavern in NYC, but that's not important right now).But don't think that this place is just about the burgers, the full menu is fresh, delicious, and nearly entirely made in-house.  The steak is more flavorful and ""beefy"" than steaks costing three times as much, the fish & chips are completely perfect, and the beer selection is wonderful, varied, and includes numerous rotating casks.  I've heard about a couple of inconsistency problems from friends, but never experienced them myself.All that said, the reason I'll be back (even though I now live 715 miles away) is the burgers, the wonderful, juicy, beefy burgers, on warm house-baked potato rolls."
"The experience was great! The fish & chips was incredible. The chicken wings were some of the best I had and Alex, the server, was the man! He was great at explaining the food and different beers. His recommendations were top notch and my friend and I had a great time! I will definitely be returning in the future!"
"Liked the food, not the service. Our waitress seemed awfully bored and unhappy to be there. We went there on a Tuesday for their $15 burger, beer, and bourbon special. We got there around 830 and had to wait about 45 mins because there were several reservations ahead of us.The burger and the fries were great! ask for dipping sauces! It came with the standard garlic butter sauce or something, but the waitress also brought ketchup with a spicy kick and wasabi mayo? totally unexpected. We got the add ons (eggs, cheese, and bacon?) without realizing that there's an up charge, so our $15 burger came out to be like $22-23 each which is steep for a burger (since I didn't like the beer and didn't take a shot of the cheap bourbon. Even the waitress herself said its' just a cheap low quality shot of bourbon!) Would I go there again? maybe, but not for the burger. Oh, also, our first burger came way under cooked (it was still very red) eventhough we asked for medium rare. The waitress happily took it back because it was obviously way undercooked, but our replacement burger was great, but maybe great doesn't cut it when there are so many awesome burger places in Chicago."
"Bangers and mash, perfection!!!!!!!!Their fish fry is the best in the city as far as I am concerned. Lightly battered not to heavy and not at all greasy.Lets get onto their signature cocktails.One day I came in here, and  tried almost every single one.Unreal!!!!!!And yes, I remembered walking out of there.I love the cozy upstairs with the couch and fireplace, and the dark oak surrounding you.It reminds me of my grandparents library.I love this place, and will always continue to come back!"
"Loved this place! The service was great, the food was delicious -- the charcuterie app was a great way to try different meats -- and the drinks were yummy. But the best part is this place really feels like a British pub. It's a little too new to be 100% authentic, but give it a few more years and it will have that worn in ease that you find all over London. The rooftop is an intimate, lovely way to spend a beautiful summer evening. Parking is easy peasy. And we had no trouble getting a table. In fact, I wish it had been a little more difficult -- I don't want to lose this place. We'll definitely be back."
"Yes, big time.  The burger is insanely good, and every other dish I've ordered has been delish.  The service is great too, and the pub atmosphere is relaxed, hip, and pleasant.  Lots of beers to pick from as well --  try the cask beers.  The location is kind of strange and was initially cause for some skepticism on my part considering it's right next to the tacky movie theater.  It's easy to assume that it could afford to suck since if you're just looking for a bite to eat and you're stuck at the theater your options are pretty much limited to O&E, the BBQ place next door, or possibly the Golden Nugget.  However, it's fantastic, and a great addition to Logan Square.Also!  There's roof seating!"
"What a great bar!  The drinks are fantastic and very reasonably priced.  The best part is that you can actually breathe there on a Saturday night.  I really was surprised that it wasn't overcrowded like most bars are.  But that's probably due to it's location, which incidentally worked out for me as I was able to find a parking space really close."
"Owen & Engine has bestowed upon us cask ale!  Beer geeks unite! This place has a great selection of brews. I will have to give them extra points for having Founders on tap. The interior is very classy.  I came here for brunch and ordered the English Breakfast. I gotta say, it just seemed ""okay.""  The baked beans seemed a little bit off mark. Larger portions of the black 'n white sausage would've been nice.  I enjoyed the ""Bubbles 'n Squeak.""  I've never really had it before, so I don't know how it compares to others. There's a second floor with a fireplace & leather couches, along with a 2nd bar & additional seating.I'm a beer snob so I came here for the cask ale served from their engines.  Pumped from the cellar downstairs, this is true ale.  The lack of Co2 allows you to enjoy the full taste of this liquid gift from God.  There is a significant difference.  I learned this the hard way after picking up a 6pack at Binny's after enjoying the same beer from their engine.  It just wasn't the same!  I will definitely be coming back here.."
"Excellent gastropub fare! A well thought out beer list with something on tap for nearly every taste. We started with the Chicken Wings as a starter. The spicy wings came with a cooling chive creme fraiche on the side, brings wings to a higher level. The cornish pasty was fantastic. The main ingredient changes regularly, we had the brisket. We liked it so much we thought we would order some to take home, but they don't do takeout orders. We need go back and try other varieties!We had the hamburgers, and they are truly one of the best we had. One of our party had a lamb sandwich and claimed it was excellent. Of course as others have written, the chips with the malt aioli are the best.Deserts were very unusual and combined some really interesting flavors. Our favorite was a brown cake with celery root ice cream on the side.Who would have thought celery root ice cream would taste so good!The staff was knowledgeable and helpful.They did not rush us and since we were with good company that was just fine!"
"Just what the doctor ordered for me. I was at work on a friday wanting to get out of there when there was still two hours until I was off and this was exactly what I needed to kick back.I got here around 8 on a friday and it wasn't too bad for me and my friend to grab a seat. The upper bar and lounge area was a bit harder to get a seat, but we were fine in the main area. Seeing as how I was in a bar geared towards an English feel, I did my duty and started ordering up Fuller's to get my fix. As far as the food, I got the fish n chips while also getting some welsh rarebit too. The fish n chips were extremely good. The fish was real light, but with a lot of meat, and they gave two sauces for the fish and fries. Both teh tartar sauce and what looked to be a mayo were great compliments to the food. The fries were smaller but were seasoned great. The welsh rarebit however was the real star. This was some of the best welsh rarebit I've ever had. I mean it was damn good, and its one of my favorite things to have. The sauce was nice and thick and the cheese was just perfect. Seriously, I was in food bliss with that and the fuller's esb. I really liked the feel here overall. It was relaxed and there was zero problem having a conversation as well. The beer list is absolutely perfect for what they are going for. This is what you want and there is no pretense about being anything other then an english styled pub. While I was mostly sticking to the english beers that they had on the list, I had to have a bit of fun and get some duchess de bourgogne from the draft. I didn't try any of the cask beers that they had going, so that will have to wait for the return"
"This is the second time that I've been to this restaurant, and it has only gotten better since the last time I was here, which was at the beginning of 2012.We decided to come back on a Tuesday in order to take part in their $15 burger, beer, and bourbon special that occurs every Tuesday. Normally their burger is priced at $15, so this is a great deal. We made a reservation for 7pm, and I was glad that we did as the restaurant was bustling upon arrival, and several groups of people were waiting for a table. We sat at a table near the bar, and the atmosphere was lively (and loud!) but our party of three was still able to carry on a conversation.We decided to start off our meal with the Slagel Pork Rillettes that was served with sweet pickles, lavash, and a few pieces of a baguette. The pork was amazing, as you could taste a certain smokiness to the meat which was exceptional. We all likened the consistency to mayo-less tuna salad (this description really isn't doing the appetizer justice, but trust me, it was amazing) in which you could spread the mixture onto the bread and top with the pickles. There was a decent sized portion for all three of us to share, and we each got a piece of the baguette and the lavash. I'm not for sure if this was intentional, but it's nice when a restaurant adequately portions out an appetizer given the number in the party.Let me back track to the beer and the bourbon that were included with the $15 special. The beer was an easy to drink, light lager. I didn't quite catch the name of it, but it was their beer of the night. Also, they were out of their bourbon, so they served up a rye whiskey which was smooth and also very easy to drink. Just to clarify (as I didn't see any other yelpers mention this) you do not get to choose your beer or bourbon for the Tuesday night special.Now, onto the burgers. We all decided to get the burgers topped with the cheddar cheese and had them cooked to medium perfection. There is something special about the burgers here that I cannot get enough of. They are seasoned to perfection and the beef speaks for itself. Normally when I eat a burger I love to have tons of veggies/sauces to enhance the flavor of the meat. The opposite is true at Owen & Engine. I almost felt guilty ordering it with cheese this time (but who can resist an aged cheddar?!) as the flavors of the beef and the caramelized onions are outstanding as is. You also have the option of adding bacon or a fried egg, but I just can't bring myself to do it. Whatever Owen & Engine is doing to their beef is amazing, as I thought the days of ""plain"" burgers were long gone, existing only as a fleeting memory in my childhood. The burgers come with a sizeable portion of french fries which are served with a dipping sauce that is to die for. The fries greatly accentuate the burger, and are downright delicious.For dessert we decided to split the Carrot Cake Trifle. This was the most unique and delicious spins I think I've ever seen on a carrot cake. The waiter described it as a ""blood orange soup"" on the bottom with a piece of carrot cake floating on the soup, topped with a walnut cracker/crisp, and polished off with a cream-cheese like mousse. When it arrived, it was beautifully plated, only to be destroyed in a matter of minutes. The waiter had us try the cream-cheese mousse first, as it was very unique and strong tasting, but it greatly enhanced the dessert. My favorite part of this dish was the blood orange soup and the cream-cheese mousse. The cake was a little dry, but once it met the blood orange soup the flavor were amazing together. I would definitely recommend this dessert to anyone who loves carrot cake and/or blood oranges.Lastly, the service was a little slow, but I think it was because they were fairly busy. Our waiter was nice and helpful, but he forgot to put in our appetizer, so it came out with the burgers. He apologized multiple times, and gave us the appetizer for free, which was nice. Other than that, I can't really complain about anything, and I will definitely be back in the near future."

"Went here last night for dinner with my girlfriend. We walked in and got seated right away. Our server was great and handled all our questions with ease. We started off by sharing a Scotch Egg. The mustard was so good that I was tempted to drink it! We ordered the Clam Chowder and  Chicken Cassoulet - we almost went with the standard Bangers and Mash & Fish and Chips, but our waitress said those would always be on the menu and the chef was from Connecticut and was REALLY serious about his seafood. While in the middle of eating we switched and after a few large bites, switched back. At the end of the meal, both our plates were empty.The beer selection here is great! Just make sure you don't order one of the $30 bottles at the bottom - unless it's what you want. Our visit was nothing short of spectacular. We left full of food and drink, and will be returning."
"Great beer list, they had a Yakima hops dark IPA by Victory on special for only $3 a glass. Are you insane? I ordered the Pasty meatpie and it was awesome. Really big and meaty and delicious. The pickled indian cauliflower and beets as a side were good too. Very zippy. The atmosphere is very classy-  rich mahogany and antiquarian book type place. It would be a good date spot. It reminded me of Longman & Eagle or that one place, Ampersand & Ampersand. Oh wait, tha place doesn't exist but it will soon.The staff was also really cool and attentive."
"We were one of the first customers ever at Owen and Engine, and have since become regulars, and I've labored long and hard over what to say in a review. Owen and Engine is one of our favorites, and we do go a lot. That said, the menu changes often and the service and experience can be a little erratic.The good: The Tuna Melt on the Saturday lunch menu is the best tuna melt I have ever had (as it is for everyone who has tried it). It is amazing. I hear the pub curry is of the same quality, but I am not a curry person, so I couldn't say.The Fish and Chips - I finally tried them the other day. What have I been missing all my life? I loved the pea puree and the sauce, and I have been craving more all week.The Scones - If you order tea during brunch, definitely make sure you get a pot of tea so that you can try Owen and Engine's amazing scones. Love them - especially the Chocolate Chip. The Beer Selection/Elliot - The beer selection at Owen & Engine is one of the best in the city. If you are a beer lover/beer nerd, don't miss O&E. Same if you love cocktails and hard liquor. I could go on and on about the rare and wonderful beers I've had here, but all I will say is that they had Topless Wych on tap, followed by Ham & Rye. So good. They also had Bourbon County Coffee Stout in bottles for weeks. Duck Egg - Try it. It's like an egg, only richer and better.The bad: The Wait - now that Owen & Engine has become more popular, the wait for a table can sometimes be long. Make reservations if you're going to be in a hurry.The service (sometimes) - Depending on who is serving you, service can sometimes be slow. We've figured out who is better or worse, and it's really only one person who's the problem, but regardless. When it's good, it's great. The one or two bad experiences have been really really slow service. We love Owen & Engine, and you will too!"
"On occasions, I cross the pond and savor the goodness that is Merry Old England.  In between those occasions, I go to Owen & Engine.So... there are actual British speaking clientele in this joint, on the fringe of Logan Square.  Dishes are traditional to a fault, but as with any gastro-pub worth its salt these days, elevated.  Bangers and mash contained nice hearty sausage and really creamy potato.  Fish and Chips is seriously making me waver about that top spot that The Gage currently holds on my list.  The mushy peas with the fish were ok.  Since I can only claim colonial Britain as a small part of my heritage/background, hard to say whether I like it or not.The Yorkshire pudding, on the other hand, is the stuff sweet dreams are made of.  Ooops, I just admitted in public my moment of wanton disregard, oink oink.  I will say no more about this.Lastly, the Cornish pasty.  At O&E, the fillings change frequently.  If you've read my write-ups here before, you know that any restaurant that inspires me to make the similar dish at home is A-OK in my book.  I have just recently discovered Trader Joe's frozen pie crust.  So i roll it out, put whatever filling is on hand, pop in the oven, get whatever chutney is on-hand, and fix a small salad with a tart dressing.  I've gone to town.Why 4 stars?  Solid British classics.  With what Virgin Atlantic charges for upper-class, i can eat at O&E 120 times.  You do the math."
"Owen and Engine is about two blocks from where I live and thank god it is so close. This place hands down has the best burger I have ever eaten. They use short rib, prime rib and something else amazing and make their own patties on location. I am also fully obsessed with their Fish and Chips which has an amazing malt taste fried right in. My favorite thing to do is go with someone else and order one of each and split. The cocktail list is also amazing from what I hear from my Fiance. Love Love Love this place!"
"So the place to hang on a cool (maybe one day cold) Chicago evening.  This place is so unassuming - so not about the smack - and yet still carries all the swank of a NYC restaurant - YEA I said it - its not the gage  - THANK GOD - it's not prissy like Fill In the Blank. It is heart, appropriately slow, warm, welcoming, casual without in that oh I just want to hang out by the fire but still look picture perfect in my winter wool ensemble.The crowd is a good mix of artsy - to fartsy with a low amount of bridge and tunnel in the room. Everyone always appears to be unassumingly well appointed and just perfect.  So shhh if this sounds good don't talk it up too much.....The service here is five STAR FIVE FRIGGIN STAR! seriously - I am using the word unassumingly again because - that is my favorite thing - this is DA PLACE - MY PLACE... yea downstairs is perfect for dinner - but if you ask me I will only eat upstairs even if I have to stand - it feels like my home away from home... You may remember years ago on the lower west side (barrow st. in fact) there was the PERFECT restaurant - called: the grange...MY FAVORITE SPOT ON THE PLANET (ok the Nikkei hotel restaurant, London was my favorite spot on the planet but you know what I mean) Owen and Engine is The Grange 2012 - seriously HUGE COMPLIMENT.Only Owen and Engine has a fire place upstairs - sSHHHH seriously don;t tell the bridge and tunnel folk.Did I mention the cute sexy boy to me ration is like 100 to 1 yea place is dripping cute sexy boys - straight/gay/hipstery/older younger - they got em working there, eating there, drinking there - this is the place single folk to find you a MAN- who obs has a job because this place is not exactly cheap - but they do have some easy to swallow *blushing* deals for those of you who like burgers and beer (MEN) see what am I talking about they like DRAW THEM IN. Oh yea the food is FLAWLESS. Like farm to table BAM! like interesting food - marrow etc BAM, like LARGE sharable portions BAM!Seriously if you see me by the fire - please say hi and please buy me a drink!"
"This place is a spot-on gastro-pub, everything is made in house and is freakin' delicious. Great beer selection of craft and micro-brews, inventive specialty cocktails (love the Pimm's cups), amazing house-ground burgers (get it with the bacon and cheddar!), and the fish and chips are made with fresh fish flown in from the North East daily. It's their attention to detail and dedication to fresh ingredients that makes Owen & Engine stand out. There are two floors here, and two bars as well. I like to dine upstairs, generally, either at the bar, or on their back patio- which has more communal seating. I've noticed it's become increasingly difficult to get a table here as it becomes more popular, but I'm not the kind of person who begrudges a restaurant for being well-liked. The servers have always been extremely helpful and knowledgeable, with the bar-tenders being the best example of this. they're always willing to give suggestions, make pairings of food and drink, and generally are willing to carefully navigate you through the experience. This place is one of my favorites in the city."
"I had seen on Serious Eats website that this place had the best burger in town, and I am on a kick of tasting as many good burgers as possible while I live in this city. So, I dragged the bf with me on a Saturday afternoon for lunch (they only offer brunch on Sunday) and there were a few other tables downstairs, but also a few tables open which was great. We both got the burger with cheddar, and I thought it was amazing! My bf's burger was good too, but he didn't like that 1/2 way through his bottom bun was totally soggy from the juices/greese/etc. The meat itself is what makes this burger so good, but it was a very fatty burger so I don't think I could eat this very often. The cheddar cheese was very tasty as well, and the potato onion bun was soft and delicious. The fries were good, and came with a malt vinegar aioli instead of the standard ketchup. My only complaints would be the tiny glass of coke we got. The glasses were tall and skinny, probably for alcoholic beverages normally, but it only held about 6 oz. of coke with ice! And we didn't want to have her get 10 refills for us, so we drank slowly. And I know, I went to this great beer place with all sorts of new and different stuff on draft, but it was a Saturday afternoon, so I didn't want to drink that early. Oh one other awesome thing is how it's decorated, and feels like you are in someone's house. In the winter, it's probably very cozy!"
"My ""Go-To"" place after work.  I'm in the industry and this is a frequent place for me to unwind after work and have a beer. This place serves one of the best burgers in the city and it also has a great rotating beer list.  Everything I've had here has been good to excellent.  Great staff too!"
"Another great beer destination. They have a beer draft system from England that has no refrigeration and low carbonation.  Tried a brown ale and it was ok.  Tasted like a a beer that's been left out for a few days and seemed a little bland.  Bar keep said that he would describe it as ""creamier"" more than anything coming out of the draft but i disagree.  Still, i like the fact that they offer it and i wouldn't mind trying other beers (they sample different beers from that system on a regular basis).From their regular tap, I tried their Entire Butt Stout (yes, great name i know) also from England and it was very tasty.  But the best beer is the Double Down 'N' Even Dirtier Imperial Stout (yes, another great name).  Bar keep claimed that it was the best beer of the house and this time i agreed with him.  Have a full bar with a cozy pub like atmosphere. Kind of cool. Staff is friendly and if you ask for a tasting of any of their beers they will likely oblige.  Be warned though...people here seemed a little pretentious. At least when I was there.  As for the menu, didn't eat other than some fries (or ""chips"") but the offering seemed interesting.  A few people around us ordered the cheese tray and it looked really scrumptious.  Others ordered the burger with fried egg on top (ok everyone...stop with the fried egg on a burger already...not original any more) and it looked descent too.  If you're around this area and thirsty for a good brew, you gotta try this place.  Interestingly enough that it's right across the street from the movie theater on Diversey and Western.  Good for a drink before or after a flick (which is what we did)."
"Great food, great beer & drink selection.  I love that all the staff know the preparation and provenance of all the menu ingredients and craft beers.  Food is delicious, space is very comfortable.  But minus one star for the horrible disco music they play in there.  It's too loud, and it sucks.  We go to places like O & E to sit and drink in peace.  Wish they would play something better, and turn it dowm.  Or better yet turn it off altogether.  But the burgers are fantastic...."
"Before I get into the food, I've got to give some attention to the building itself. Yes, that's right. No preamble. No story. No witty recount. I'm all business tonight. The building. It's brand new. Seriously. Props to the owners for creating a space that conveys ease, class, British otherness, and warmth. The main floor dining room is a fantastic eating space but to truly understand the specialness of the building, go upstairs. Check out the bathroom. Contemplate the couches. Think about nestling at the bar in cold weather whilst sipping a grown-up beverage. You'll want to do this in a month or so. Trust. The space instantly conveyed what Owen & Engine is and made me happy to be there to take more in. So, as good as the food and drink are (and they are both very very good), take some time to appreciate the effort that went in to constructing the perfect place to transport you from Logan Square to England. I think that's pretty special.Since you can't eat or drink buildings, I'm sure you want to know about the food and drink. Solid. Enjoyable. Pleasing. A wee bit inconsistent. Upon my first visit, I was all about five stars. The second visit made me recognize that, while things are good, they aren't as good as it gets. But, that's okay. Here's what trips my trigger: the fact that everything is made fresh by the staff and what you'll order will, likely, change from one visit to the next. The bangers and mash are a staple. They're always around. They're always delicious. They're always filling. And, they're always easy to share. Get them. The above applies to the fish & chips. Actually, you won't want to share. Get your own. I HATE all things mayonnaise and I eat up every last bit of aioli with the crispy, crunchy haddock. I've enjoyed a custard ham small plate that was decadently rich. Likewise, the charcuterie, breads and cheese plate should all bring smacks to your lips and smiles to your belly. Dessert is always a good choice but I can't stop thinking about the rhubarb delight that graced the spring menu. If you're a drinker, I challenge you to find a beer or cocktail that doesn't impress you. You can't do it. The 1st Ward with its bourbon, hum, orange, and lemon will get you drunk. I could waste flowery words on it but let's be real: it will rock your world. It's strong. This doesn't take away from the artistry behind the cocktail, but I am talking real talk. Start with a cocktail and finish with one of the eleventy-billion beers. You will not be able to find one that doesn't do it for you. You can't. If you say you can, you're lying. And miserable. And no fun. Don't fight it. It can't be done.England's on my to-visit list but until such time as I am cheery-o'ing in foggy weather, you can bet I'll be at O&E, taking in the good food and drink in the kind of comfort that comes straight from the pages of a book. Enjoy."
"I really love this place.I've been here twice; once for brunch and once for dinner.For brunch, we tried the pull-apart buns, scones, steak and eggs, and burger. Everything was delicious. I particularly loved the scones, especially the earl grey scone. The burger was by-far the stand-out of the meal. The bun was unbelievable, the meat was incredibly moist and flavorful, the cheese and caramelized onions melted in my mouth.... I couldn't wait to have it again. In addition, the malt vinegar aioli for dipping the fries was so perfect.For dinner we had to have the burger again. Both my dining partner and I decided it's the best burger we've ever had. Beer selection is wonderful, the decor is masculine and classy, and the service is great.Highly recommended."
"Went here for their Tuesday burger, beer and bourbon special for $15.... Well worth it. I thought the burger was one of the best I've had in the city. The fries were delicious alone but the malt vinegar aïoli sauce made them all the better. We got a Scotch Egg on the side. Delicious. Overall I was surprised because it's a British Pub but blown away by how good the food was. Definitely worth checking out this special."
"This place is really great! Their organic bison burger is the BEST burger in the city and I haven't tried anything I haven't liked yet. Great selection of beer and spirits. Cozy atmosphere, helpful and accommodating staff, there's nothing bad to say! The most important of all, they're consistent."
"While I so desperately want to give this a 5-star, the whole set-up of the bar and waiting area loses a star.  We arrived last night with a 1.5 hour wait.  Ok....great beer at the bar so we were ok with that.  It was as if we were invisible to the bartenders - this the loss of another star.  One bartender just forgot we were about to order, walked away and never came back, another looked me straight in the eye at least 3 times and never asked for our drink order.  I shouldn't have to shout out to get served a drink at an upscale gastro-pub.In the meantime I was being bounced around by all of the people trying to shove past the bar area.  There we no seats at the bar so we stood and my purse kept getting banged around every minute or so and I had to move about every minute or so as the wait staff uses that only standing room in the joint to get to/from the kitchen.  Oddly, there is a HUGE area behind the bar itself so the bartenders have plenty of room to move around.  Hmmm....if only they built the bar and pushed it back a few feet this problem would be solved.We were finally sat at a table and I have to say the food was stupendous and the beers even better.  Our waiter was courteous and lovely and knowledgeable.  It if weren't for the bartenders and waiting area, this would be a 5-star.  I had the fish and chips and substituted the mash.  OMG.  Delightful.  The fish is light and fluffy and perfectly friend, the mashed potatoes are out of this world with cheddar cheese in them.  We also ordered the charcuterie plate as an appetizer.  Loved the pork sausage, the blood sausage had no taste (but I'm not a big fan anyway), breads were great, pickled veg was good and bacon skin was good.  Didn't love the duck liver mousse but that's just because I can't do liver in any form.I will definitely go back, hoping they fix some of the issues above in the interim."
"Hamburger.  Paradigm.  Shift.  My knees buckled with each bite, and I was seated.We knew we were in a reputable gastropub when one of the bouncers from Hopleaf pulled up a seat at the bar.  It's an auspicious omen.On our first visit, I insisted we split the famed but rather pricey burger ($14), if only to earn our tsk-ing rights.  But that's not how it went down at all.  The half that Tom ate will always be the one that got away.This is a burger whose natural glory makes ketchup a four letter word.  I am brash enough to add cheese, however, and I'm not sorry.  The Barber's cheddar comes masterfully melted and adds a distinct tartness and nuttiness to the flavor profile.  I recommend it.I order it rare, and that's how I get it.  Charred on the outside, fuchsia in the middle, and Juicy everywhere like it's 1994. The caramelized sweetness of the grilled onions blends into the meat almost imperceptibly.  There's a reason they come with the burger.Each bite is its own exquisite sensory experience.  I eat in slow motion.  There will be no conversation.  I only open my eyes long enough to map the route to my next bite.  I will tolerate no distraction.  The knowledge that the burger is made of 3 different kinds of ground beef (shortrib, brisket, and chuck) serves only to offer some explanation of its grandeur - and to convince me not to try to duplicate it at home.The house-cured olives are outstanding, and merit mention. They're herbal and earthy, and punchy but not too strong.  I've heard a lot about the fish and chips, and for $17, that's all I'm going to do.  Let me know how that works out for you.The garish, unsightly view of the movie theater across the street undermines the elegance of the atmosphere, at least on the ground level, but who cares when your eyes are closed in carnivorous rapture?  The upper level has its own bar and more of a lodge-like feeling, and is worth peeping out even if you're seated downstairs.  It's good to be informed.Owen and Engine's burger got me giddy, and I'm sporting Cupid's arrow like Steve Martin's headband.  Call me a jerk, but don't talk to me until I've savored the last morsel."
"Bangers and Mash.  GreatBurger.  ABSOLUTELY the BEST in the CITY.  Forget Kuma this is it.Bone Marrow with escargot.  was pretty good.Chicken was phenomenal.Mulled Cider was great and the selection of bourbon was fantastic.Overall great place, there were a couple dishes we didnt care for but the service was outstanding and we will definitely be back."
"I think this is my first 5 star review. There might be one in my past, but I don't give them out often. Simply put, there was nothing I would have changed about this place. It was a 5 out of 5 in every way.First of all, I LOVED the look and feel. Straight out of London, complete with pump taps, generous wood finishes, and antique-y feel. Bar upstairs and down.We came here before a movie with a group of 8, they easily accommodated us upstairs. Our server was great, and she clearly took pride in the food she served (evident when explaining and answering questions). Most of us got the burger special (which on Tuesday is their $14 burger but for an extra DOLLAR we got a Pacific IPA AND a shot of bourbon. A dollar.) One guy got the ploughman, which he said was great, and one got some kind of starter with rhubarb spread that was extremely tasty. Now, $14 is a lot for a burger, but easily worth it. Patty is made by hand, out of brisket, ground chuck, and I think ground pork. One of the best burgers I've had in the city and a true hidden burger gem. Comes with fries and homemade ketchup, which was also great (and very unique). I can't believe I'd never even heard of this place, but I'm glad I found it and can't wait to go back. This place is a must-try, and if you can't find someone to go with you, message me and I will go."
"Tuesday night special- burger, beer, and bourbon $15.This is about as good as it gets people!The decor is a cozy across-the-pond atmosphere. I absolutely loved it.  I could have stayed all night visiting with people at the bar.Our server was excellent. Very attentive and helpful but not obtrusive.  She never rushed us as we sat and enjoyed ourselves for a little over 2 hours.Food- best burger I've had in a LONG LONG time, and I consider myself a burger snob.  It was cooked to perfection, which lately seems to be hard to do at most places. The burger is a half pound of  60/20/20 blend of chuck, short rib, and brisket.  It comes with caramelized onions, but you can also add on aged cheddar, rashers (kinda like bacon), and/or an egg.  Drinks- I was impressed with the draft list.  Several beers I had never tried.  Obviously I had to try a couple of those.  Again, our waitress was wonderful and was very knowledgeable about the list.I can't wait to come back!"
"I stumbled across this place when a group of friends and I were waiting to see a movie across the street. We were taken away by the cool decor, and the brioche toast our first time around, and we decided that it would be worth a visit for a proper meal. Long story short: O&E is a typical British gastropub with most of the dishes you would expect to see at such a place. Food: 3.5/5Oysters: Oysters are oysters, and these were good and fresh. As long as they were alive prior to being shucked, I feel like you know what you're in for. There appeared to be two different types of oysters here, and they didn't taste overly briney/salty.Ginger and scallion meatballs: The meatballs here were very delicate, but definitely contained a lot of filler. Preparation was very good, although I felt like it was very light on the seasoning; in other words, I felt like these were fairly bland, in stereotypical British-food fashion. If you don't get these, I don't think you'd be missing out on too much.Slagel pork rillettes: I'll explain it like this - the texture was essentially canned tuna mashed together with pate to form a glob of food. It didn't taste like canned tuna. But it didn't really taste like pork, either. That's not a very attractive way to explain it, but it's the most straightforward way. However, it was pretty good; in fact, I enjoyed this texture, and I also liked that it was mild and salt seemed to be used sparingly. However, I must note that the pickles overwhelmed the taste of the rillettes. This dish was good, but nothing extraordinary.Slagel Farm Scotch egg: This is essentially a hardboiled egg wrapped with sausage, breaded, and deep-fried. I mean, does anything that really sound bad in this? The Scotch egg was my favorite ""snack"", and the house-made mustard was a wonderful complement. Haddock fish and chips: I thought the chips (fat fries) were the best part of this entree. They were fried to a perfect crisp on the outside with a fluffy inside. I love fries, and these definitely are some of my favorites I had in recent memory. The haddock was coated with a straightforward beer batter. They cooked the fish beautifully, and it was moist without being greasy. However, I thought that the pea puree was fairly flavorless, and the house-made tartar sauce. For fish and chips, O&E's version is up there as one of my favorites. If you want to try something typically British, I definitely recommend the fish and chips.Housemade Slagel Farms pork bangers and mash with onion gravy: Let's start with the mash - these potatoes were the dense kind of mashed 'taters, but there's nothing wrong with that in my opinion. I thought they tasted just fine with the onion gravy. The sausage bangers were juicy, but not very memorable. Again, I feel like Owen & Engine is following that British cookbook a bit too closely. I like it when sausage has some seasonings, some kick to it! But alas, it wasn't meant to be. I thought the bangers and mash I had at various run-of-the-mill pubs across London were superior to this one.Roasted half chicken with broccoli and fingerling au gratin: This chicken dish was highly recommended by our server, so we decided to give it a shot. She was particularly proud of how it was soaked in brine for ""several days"" to keep it juicy and delicious. What ended up happening was that the chicken ended up being salty and a bit rubbery even. Admittedly, I only had the dark meat whereas two of the guys that had the white meat thought that it was perfect. I didn't get a chance to try the white meat, but given the Amish chicken I had at Ruxbin, I was disappointed. However, I did love the broccoli and fingerling potato au gratin. It was definitely a lighter version of what you might be used to with au gratin, with a creamy-but-not-gooey cheese sauce.spiced pumpkin cake: I really liked this dessert. You could easily smell the pumpkin spice as the cake was sliced into, and the granita was very refreshing. This dessert was light, flavorful, and not overwhelmingly sweet - just what I like from my desserts. I recommend this one if they have it!Service: 5/5Friendly, fast, and usually good recommendations. The service brought up the rating from a 3.5 to a 4.Overall/Value: 4/5So overall, Owen & Engine delivers on its concept of being a rustic British pub. I did think that everything we ate was cooked just right, and that in of itself is a mark of a great restaurant. But I didn't leave excited about my next trip back here, although the uniquely crafted beer list may be a good enough reason for Round 3. I thought the prices were fair, but I've seen better value at some other good Chicago restaurants."
"Stellar, amazingly lovely and comfortable interior.  There is a roof deck too, where if you go on a nice day like we did you can just relax, feel the warmth of the sun and get wafts of (the best) BBQ from the place next door.  The brunch has a nice selection of items, one friend of mine got this heirloom tomato salad, which had some of the most beautiful looking tomatoes ever, another got the pancakes with big strips of bacon across the top, and the other got the Full English Fry Up, which is like every typical British food item you can think of on one plate.  I myself got the seasonal vegetable quiche, which came with a small lettuce salad drizzled with a lemon vinaigrette.  Lovely and perfectly sized portion.  I also had the chance to sample the French Press coffee they serve, and it is worth it to get the big pot!  They say it is 3 cups but I would wager it is closer to 5 or 6.  It's a lot of coffee!Overall, great place.  Somewhere I would not hesitate to come back to again and again."
"I really appreciate this place for all it does.Why I like it so much:-Service...they all know what they are talking about & it is so refreshing to go somewhere and actually learn something new. You can tell that they are all passionate about what they do. I love a place where they greet with you a smile and are happy to see you.-Food: I have been impressed with everything I've tried. Some things stand out more than others- FISH&CHIPS, BURGER, BEER SELECTION.-Comfort: It gets a little loud when it's busy, but that goes w/o say'n. The real treat is sitt'N up on the 2nd floor on a not-so-busy night, with it's ideal lay-out and choice music play'n in the background.Could be my new favorite place in Chicago..."
"Peas & Carrots do Owen & Engine, part 1.We had to move quickly as we had an event to go to around the corner, so we grabbed two seats at the bar and went for it. I ordered a lovely Belgium on tap which it turned out, wasn't what the tapper said it was so the fantastic bartender put that one on the house. Classy.We decided to split some items: a pasta with pesto which was a bit too salty for us, but the housemade (I presume) noodles were silky and lovely. The fish & chips, as everyone has already pointed out, were indeed really really really good. The pea puree was fresh and bright, the vinegar aioli was something I had been dreaming of for years (how had no one provided that yet? It's perfect and solves the ""where did the vinegar go after I put it on my fish?"" dilemma of yesterday). We pretty much inhaled it, without shame or apology. I know we got a third item but I can't recall what it was.The bill wasn't too high, the ambiance was pleasant and the company was stellar. I am really excited to go back. It seems like a great place for anything from a date to a solo experience at the bar. A surprising find indeed."
"I would give this place 5 stars but my initial interaction with the host could have completely ruined my experience. However, the Manager and server completely made up for all her short comings. We were celebrating my cousins birthday and we decided to do what we do best and order family style. This is really a fancy and less obnoxious way of eating an obscene amount of food without feeling too guilty. We started off with their homemade pretzel and scottish egg and both were really delicious. Then we dove into the serious stuff and devoured the MOST delicious fish n' chips, burger and meat pie I've ever had. The crust for the meat pie was perfectly flakey, buttery and golden brown. Their meat pie selection changes daily...so I'll have to come every day this week to see what else they got, I'm addicted. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and towards the middle of the meal we let him order the rest of our food. I look forward to coming back and having him show us around the rest of the menu!"
"I don't drink bourbon and I wasn't in the mood for a burger, but i pass this place on my way to Mariano's at least twice a week.  So i checked out Yelp and it sounded like a great choice for a fast casual dinner for me myself and i rather than shopping for it. Parking is tricky what with the permit only neighborhoods, the 4-6 rush hour ban on Western and the theatre across the way, but i managed.The place was nearly empty, so i sat at the bar. The folks were friendly, especially the woman behind the bar who served me.  Most bars have the stereotypical male employee who's old enuf to act mature and smart enuf to know customers can hear and form opinions about a place, but choose to ignore their level of age and intelligence in favor of acting out.  I have learned to just ignore them in the process.  So I don't hold that against O & E.To Jacob J who just reviewed O & E - the ambient music was not playing last night - at least I don't consider the Doobie Brothers and Hall & Oates to be ambient, they're not British either so ?? at least it wasn't loud.  The Cornish pasty in another review caught my fancy since I remember eating these in Canada.  And it was shredded lamb last night - the most moist tasty lamb i've had anywhere. The crust was perfect and the sides were equally balanced and proportioned.   I tried the Bombadier beer, not my usual libation but it suited the meal.  I will most assuredly return, mate.  Probably on my bike next time!"
"Owen and Engine has officially made it to my top 10 Chicago restaurants list.  I've never had a dish I didn't enjoy and the beer selection is vast enough that my beer snob partner always finds at least 4 beers he needs to try.But, the stand out for me are the bartenders - Christopher and Jeremy to be specific.  These guys are outstanding and have some serious drink mixing knowledge.  They will custom make a cocktail for you (for me it's always, ""please include egg whites and any liquor but gin"") and IT WILL BE DELICIOUS.  Plus, they're fun to talk to when they're not busy hand crafting cocktails.Call them to make a reservation and go here!"
Love the atmosphere and food.  They make great drinks.  Park across the street at the movie theatre for $2.
"nice beer selection and solid meal options, a good place to go before taking in a movie at the cinema next door."
"Great gastropub, a bit far though right across the street from the movie theater...so a future date of cocktails and a movie would be nice.  The food is great, British pub theme.  Cocktails are very well crafted and the bartenders can go well off the menu.  Service is friendly.  I wish this was my neighborhood bar!"
"Awesome atmosphere. Pretty pricey, but great service and really good food."
"Came here for a friend's birthday.  My husband ordered a fish and chips and devoured it. He said that was good. He also ordered the burger and said it was good too. It seems those are the only two things they do right here as those are always sold out (the fish and chips sold out when I tried to order them).  I ordered a cheddar mashed potatoes - it came out very dry so I sent it back. It came back with no cheddar in it this time and when I asked about it, the waitress said it's in there. Uhh, why did she have to lie to me? I think I can tell that there's no yellow bits of cheddar in this all white mash. Anyways, we had the waitress bring out the birthday cake from the back and she told us it was $5 per person if they let us cut it at the table, or $4 per person if they cut it in back (for liability reasons). Really? First time I've ever heard that. My friend was so upset that they didn't tell us about this cake fee until now (and not when we first handed the cake over to them) that he asked to talk to the manager. 25 minutes later the manager wanders up to us. The place was pretty much empty except for 2 other customers. After explaining our issue with this cake fee, the manager agreed to waive it. Overall, the food (the fish and chips and burger) was ok but why deal with this indifferent service? There's tons of other gastropubs I'd rather visit, and one with a better name to boot."
"I had heard their Fish & Chips was the ""best around"" from my hairdresser, who is from England, so I had to give them a try.  I will be honest - they were a bit bland for my tastes.  The fish was bland, tartar sauce was also lacking taste.On the other hand, the lamb meatballs were truly fantastic, as were the fries.  The burger was very satisfying as well.  The atmosphere was cute, pub-sy, and service excellent.  We all enjoyed our speciality cocktails too.No wait @ 7pm on a Sunday.  I'll be back to O&E again, no doubt, but I have to give it a 3 starts b/c of the F&C.  I was so excited about them, but I left a bit let down.  Price for 4 was about $125 (2 apps, 3 entrees, 6 drinks)."
Really like this place. Cozy and has great service. Excellent selection.
"Having spent about half my life in the UK and half in the US, this place combines the best of both cultures like no other I have experienced. A few pints of a fine German pilsner accompanied by a scotch egg complete with a warm runny center and dipping mustard started the evening off well. Er indoors was not particularly chuffed with the lack of gluten-free options (us Brits like our gluten) but settled on the steak and fries. Basking in nostalgia, I went for the ""bangers and mash"" which was pork sausage and mashed potatoes with gravy. It was everything I'd hoped for. I fully appreciate the shortcomings of the British culinary experience but Owen and Engine overcomes all of them and excels .... accompanied by a large cottonwood tree outside and $2 parking across the street at the theatre. Will definitely return."
"Pardon my English English, but with the exception of dessert, that meal was shite. Started off with ""streaky bacon,"" aka pork belly, with ramps and mushrooms. You kind of have to order anything with ramps in the dish during the season, but give it a rest mate, the little focks aren't going to make your dish. Give me some sauce or something to pull it all together.I'll admit, the pork belly was impressively crispy, but I think they crisped the wrong bloody side, as the soft side still had the nipple visible. If you've never seen a whole uncooked pork belly, it's basically like a Chicago strip club that serves alcohol -  no minge, but nips galore. Correct me if I've gone a bit Pete Tong, but generally the skin side is the one that is crisped, init?While a bit posher than your bog-standard chippy, I reckoned Owen (with Engine's help) could pull off a decent fish and chips, but what arrived at our table left us... gutted (worst pun of the year? you decide!). The batter was so horribly salty, we had to send it back. I asked the waiter how often the batter was made, because there was no way they were serving this all night with no complaints. He didn't seem sure, but kindly exchanged the dish for the chicken wings which were edible, but not what we were hoping for. I'd heard good things about their hamburger so we decided to give it a go. Something about 3 types of meat, including brisket... *Flashes back to Fabio getting kicked off Top Chef: Allstars for making a boourger that tasted like meatloaf* The flavor was just fine, but the consistency was just a hair stiffer than the potato component in a bowl of bangers and mash. Bottom line, I'm now convinced that it's very hard to beat fresh, unadulterated 80/20 on an open flame. Consistent with our fat American lifestyle, we had to have some dessert. It was either that or theatre popcorn. The panna cotta left me with one of those I'm-Hugh-Grant-and-I'm-the-good-looking-one-in-­this-movie smiles. I don't know how the pastry chef got the thin strawberry gelee layer on so perfectly, but I can only assume this dessert was made in stages. The lime curd at the very top was lovely and proportioned perfectly. The real genius of it was that it didn't really have to be plated before serving. While it might seem a bit buffet-ish to serve dessert in a glass, this was so well crafted it wouldn't matter if you served it out of a pair of old trainers.Our server was very accommodating and the cask conditioned beer was a nice change. Even combined with the sublime dessert though, I still left with an overall bad feeling about the meal. I probably won't go back until the next Twilight movie comes out."
"The burger at Owen & Engine is what you'd expect of a stereotypical English food as I believe this burger is steamed, but don't let that dissuade you. What you get is a moist interior but an outside absent of any kind of char. The consistency is more salisbury steak than burger but don't let that turn you off. You really get a good beefy taste, further enhanced by worcestershire and onion.The potato roll is a welcome addition and more than up to the challenge of containing the moisture in this burger. Be sure to add some stilton to complete the experience. The frites served along side are excellent as well.This burger is kind of an English spin on a full-sized slider and it's definitely worth a try."
"Oh, what a night. I was just meeting up with an old friend for some drinks and maybe light appetizers, but it all went wrong. Not with O&E, of course, but with this crazy friend I thought I knew. Luckily, the other patrons had a good sense of humor and we were all able to take it in stride. The drinks were good. I only loved one of them, I think they called it the Black Widow's Kiss. I only know it had a cherry in it, and boy did they get me loaded. I got to taste a few different things. Their charcuterie plate was ok, the lamb meatballs were great and the steak was delicious. I would definitely go back, it's kind of out of the way for me."
"Hello, new favorite bar.I didn't exactly have a full night of drinking and eating by which to judge it, but the O&E Pimm's Cup? Every bit as refreshing as a regular Pimm's Cup, but with the addition of strawberry liquor. YUM. Same goes for the Bubble & Squeak, which is mashed potatoes mixed with root vegetables, served along with a complicated explanation of the name if you ask for it. The fish & chips flew out of the kitchen the whole time we were there. They looked delicious -- and bettah be, for $17 -- but we opted for the chips alone. (Yeah, that's right... potatoes with a side of potatoes.)The service was friendly, too, complete with accents that'll only get more attractive as I get more drunk. Which makes it a good thing I got outta there after two. Definitely looking forward to making a night of it next time."
"Is it THAT difficult to get non-brain-dead employees? Apparently so, if this spot is any indication. (How hard is it to pay attention to customers coming and going?!)My bus was taking forever after a little shopping on Elston, so I decided to have one cocktail before the trek home. This area used to be a no man's land for alcohol, unless you went to the Mutiny, Fat Willy's or the Chinese place on Diversey. I opted for Owen & Engine since I'd only been once before. Downstairs bar was crowded so I went upstairs. There was one seat at the end of the bar, so I sat.....and sat....and sat. Finally, a woman comes over behind the bar and says hello. I said hello to her and asked for a drink menu. Perused it quickly and sat....Tried to get the eye of the male bartender, but he was too busy fussing over the two people next to me. After 5-10 minutes have gone by, I get up and leave, telling the male, 'Thanks for that incredibly prompt service!' He smirks and says nothing but the female rushes after me, asking what's the matter. I tell her that she should have asked me what I wanted after giving me the drink menu. She tells me it's a private party that night (What does that matter? I would've gotten lousy service whether I was with the party or not) and offers to buy me a drink to make up for it. I say no, as I'm over the place and leave.The first time I was here, I put down a $20 for a bourbon and ginger and got $3 back. When I questioned it, the bartender apologized and gave me a $10 back, also. Incredibly sleazy, and after two strikes, they're out. I'll stick to Mutiny, where I've NEVER had a problem getting a drink."
"I am giving this place 4-stars.  There are some things going for it, and some things that could be improved.  First, the decor of  this place (particularly the upstairs) reminds me of a 1920's rich man's cigar smoking room.  And, in fact, I kinda feel like that while I am there, except I am surrounded by much trendier lads that would be shot if they entered that man's 1920's smoke room.  I have been here a couple times; it definitely seems like a spot you would want to go with your pals, than a one-on-one date, but that may just be me.The location is kinda cool, because it is off the beaten path, but at the same time it kinda sucks because it is right next to a lame movie theater.I liked the food.  We have had the chicken wings as a small plate, the chicken, fish & chips, and Rasher & Egg as large plates.  Each were excellent.The service was fine, but could be a bit more attentive... of course, it was always really busy when we were there (which I believe is a good thing and adds to the vibe).I do believe this place is slightly over-rated, so don't go there with too high expectations."
"First, a confession.  I did not have a beer here, which seems like sacrilege.  My only excuse was that I had an insanely early flight the following day and I knew if I had one beer, I would have two beers and  maybe even three or...  You see where this could have headed.I did, however, have the food and damn am I happy to live within walking distance of Owen & Engine!  I had their burger, which is a very interesting blend of different cuts of meat - the details escape me at the moment but these guys are on to something!  The burger doesn't seem to come with cheese but they graciously added it - I have to say, though, you really don't need it.   This is a burger that stands on its own and dare I say might be better without cheese.  Yep, it's that good.I also tried the Bubble and Squeak - I wasn't familiar with it, but the idea is that it's sort of a casserole of whatever veggies are left over from the previous night at the pub (I think they said some places do meat as well).  Owen & Engine's take on this apparent British standard involves mashed potatoes, parsnips, carrots, and I think a few other things.  It was deeee-licious.I can't wait to go back (and have beers)!"
"Wow, don't even know how to begin describing the insanely good experience I had at this fine establishment. Let's start by saying that it puts many ""authentic"" gastropubs abroad to shame. Having just returned from London and experiencing a fair share of over-priced mediocrity, Owen & Engine was a happy retreat once back in Chicago.So their beer selection is beyond fantastic, with a massive showing of specialized, seasonal, and rare beers, I was a little slow-moving to make a decision. I was happily surprised to be enabled by our knowledgeable and ever-patient bartender and waiter who were quick to offer samples and suggestions, and overall engage in a geek-out over the beers.The food was unbelievably great. I tried the clams - so warm and tasty, fish and chips - covered in the best batter I've ever had, and the bangers and mash - equally out of this world. Had ridiculously good service, food, and sips at Owen & Engine and can't wait to head back for another round!"
"Sadly, my return to Owen & Engine did not compare at all to my first visit.  Hard to know if my original stand-out experience or the chaotic, mediocre second visit was the anomaly.  Definitely not consistent.  With so many other choices, I would not return."
"A famously British bar. The neighborhood area brings it down one notch. Inside, the decor sets the proper tone. The liquor is the best part of this establishment. AHHH the bourbon. The fish & chips okay but the Burgers are solid."
"It all went so terribly wrong.I was excited to go here. The reviews were positive, the menu looked strong! The night started out well and service the entire night was excellent. I was so hungry McDonalds would have tasted good.Our appetizer of pickles was great. The service and the pickles are the only thing bumping this up to 2 stars. From here the downward spiral began...Our drinks were ok, served several minutes apart.Appetizer was again, very good,Dinner. Poor dinner.I got fish and chips.I can't believe people are saying this is good. Have they ever had real fish and chips???Hard to mess this up... but they did.They put pea puree under it and sauce ON it. I was told the sauce was supposed to be like tartar sauce, it wasn't. I don't like tartar sauce and wouldn't have wanted it on my fish, but anything would have been better than this salty mass of goo that ended up there. It made my fish taste like slimy salt water and made the fried crispiness horribly soggy. I scraped it off the best I could. The chips. Soggy. Tiny. Over-seasoned. Served with malt vinegar aioli which was terrible and barely tasted like anything. Not aioli and certainly not malt vinegar. I love a nice aioli on my fries and the punch of malt vinegar on fish and chips is half the reason to get them. I left this terrible disaster alone. Gross.My boyfriend's sandwich should have been amazing. Especially for $15. There was almost no meat on it, he basically had an arugula sandwich. It came with a pickle so he ordered a side of cheddar mash. The top was great, the bottom tasted like rancid non-stick spray.By this time I was done. I had made my decision that this place sucked and I was ready to leave. My boyfriend thought there was hope for redemption in the dessert menu. He was sorry. Three tiny pieces of flavorless chocolate cake with a seriously over salted caramel (this place loooooves their salt) and a little cocoa nib cookie that was inedible because it tasted like fried rancid oil. Get me outta here..."
"Owen & Engine has gourmet British-inspired dishes.....this I what British food would be like if it were good!  Good Scotch eggs with homemade mustard.  Very good burger (it needs no condiment), but the meat is literally a cut above your ordinary burger, and may be enough to share if you are ordering appetizers.  Excellent fries; homemade ketchup, aioli.  Good portions.  Interesting background music (not overly loud).  Beautiful and comfortable building/decor.  The scones and homemade jam were the best that I ever had, but they take time so order them early.  I brought my 10 and 13 year-old sons with me and they enjoyed everything very much!"
Who knew that an English pub would serve such an amazing brunch! I came here yesterday to celebrate a friend's b-day and the brunch was indeed a celebration. Service was amazing...and everything we consumed was impeccable. We started it off right with some Blody Mary's...which were amazing. It was served with a pickled celery stick in it. Delicious. Metropolis coffee was served in a french press and the cutest old school cups. A friend ordered hot chocolate...which was rich and delicious and served with bread with cinnamon. We ordered the crumplets and the cinnamon buns to start off....they were a sweet goey goodness.I ordered the Eggs Benedict. It was so filling and amazing. The taste of everything was rich and satisfying. And I'm we all consumed a good couple thousand calories...but it was well worth it!And the best part....the word is still not out that O&E serves a great brunch....so there was NO WAIT!!!
"There's no better way to start off dinner than with bacon and beer. Three hours later I was brought outside in a wheelbarrow. Kidding of course. Hot damn.This place shines like a new penny. I was told it's a new building built to look old, English and pubby and they do a damn good job. As the night became darker this place flipped the romantic switch. It's definitely a date spot for the beer loving couple. The beer selection was filled with local brews and I spent half the night drinking the 'hop juice' from Two Brothers Brewery out of Warrenville, IL. At 9.9% ABV, I left with a big smile on my face.With too many choices and only one stomach, we opted to try as many small plates as we could and split an entree. Beer, bacon and pickles was the start to our dinner. Fatty and rich, the bacon could have been cut with a spoon. It was outstanding. The goat cheese on the gnocchi was a nice touch. I devoured this so quickly I actually stopped talking for a few minutes. I would order this again without hesitation. And let me say that if bubble & squeak always tastes like it does here then I've found my new favorite side dish. Simply amazing.The bangers and mash were very good as well but I definitely preferred the dishes I listed above. We closed our dinner with the rhubarb crisp; crunchy, warm, delicious. Owen & Engine made a fan out of me. I'll be back with my beer loving family."
"Very tasty food, great service and ambience. A little on the pricey scale. Definitely will be frequenting this tasty menu again!"
"It was so nice to be seated in the private room on the second floor overlooking Western. We couldn't have felt more welcomed by the awesome staff. They were very helpful the entire evening. The beer list is amazing - so long that I didn't even notice they had my favorite beer until I'd already ordered a different one.We started with the pork belly which ended up being our downfall. As it came towards us we watched it teasingly jiggle on the plate. Wow. It was insanely filling. I would never order that again. It tasted magnificent but oh man, what a price to pay...I felt too full by the time my fish and chips appeared. Sadly, that didn't stop me from also eating the huge portion of incredible fish. And chips. Fantastic. I think I also had something else but the food coma set in and the next day or so is still a wonderful blur."
"I LOVE THIS PLACE!I've been here three times, and each time, I'm blown away.  We usually go sans reservations, enjoy a drink in the beautiful, cozy upstairs (damask wallpaper and dim chandeliers), and park ourselves in a small, no-reservations-needed table in the corner.  The staff immediately takes our orders from this no-reservations-needed table.  It's our own corner of heaven :)Service is great, food is excellent!  We've had chips, roasted chicken, charcuterie, and sandwiches, all were great.  The only thing I didn't love was pork rinds, but I guess I'm not a pork rinds gal, I don't think they were made incorrectly.  I highly recommend the ""Bubble and Squeak,"" named because that's what leftovers do when they're heated.  It's this potatoey gooey gravey-y dish of deliciousness.  We had a cumquat cheesecake with sliced cumquats on top, it was gorgeous.  They serve cask ales, served room temperature, like in England.  Great beer and cocktail selection.  Owen and Engine is ""wicked!"""
"With my defenses down and my stomach empty I charged into O&E with no ressie on a Saturday night.  No problem just a 45 minute wait unless i opted for the bar.  We wandered up to the bar for a pint whilst we waited and pondered the choices.  As we waited my hunger grew.  I made the choice,  several small plates and an entree to split was the only cure for this craving.First was the charcuterie,  house cured chorizo,  pork rillet,  pate and copa,  excellent!  A perfect sampling.6 Oysters,  awesome oysters by the way,  didn't need the mignonet or the lemon,  they were perfectly fresh and delicious. Then came the seared scallops with peas,   mint and something that escapes me.  Fantastic.Next was Streaky bacon,  we call it pork belly.  A perfectly cooked pig gut,  tender,  rich,  unctuous a real crafty version of a ubiquitous dish.This was supposed to be it,  but I still craved some fish.  Bring it to me I said,  the daily flown in and salt and sugar cured haddock was sublime.  By far the greatest version of fish and chips I have ever had.  The batter was thin,  crispy exactly what you want to compete with such a delicate fish.  The flesh was almost creamy,  one of the best and simplest fish dishes ever.Dessert was the,  ahh hell I forgot,  but I really enjoyed it along  with the french press coffee and the three craft brews.  It is official,   I am a glutton of the worst kind thanks to O&E."
"Great selection of craft brews and cocktails. I was surprised to see that they even had a cocktail made with Malort. If you don't know what Malort is then you apparently don't go to enough dive bars or care to abuse your taste buds. Great bar staff that helped out with beer choices and all seemed to have a sense of humor. The food was not bad and the fish and chips were great, especially the chips. I would skip the pork rinds. Went there a few times and both times the rinds tasted stale. I will definitely be back for the beer and to try more food of the menu."
"If this is what an English bar/restaurant could be, then Chicago needs to start getting more of 'em.Let's start with the great decor. It felt like I was eating in the study room of some house. Lots of wood and brass. The first floor is a great deal of booths and a nice long bar. We then headed upstairs as we were a bit early for our reservation and I suggest everyone do this. The upstairs has this great fireplace and lounge area with a smaller bar that has the same selection as the one downstairs.The staff were all cool. Our bartender upstairs was chatty and great with suggestions. Our server was very cool and great at describing all the dishes. When one of my friends mentioned that she had a sore throat the bartender downstairs made an excellent warm drink for her.The food was also very good. The bangers and mash were excellent and I had an English version of a BLT that was outstanding. Definitely looking forward to going here again."
"Excellent, all the way around.  We went here after Diversey Bowl and I must say, ""Wow!""  The upstairs is so comfortable and romantic, the food was exceptional (scotch egg, pickled veggies and the pretzel).  They had two great sour beers on tap, which were both amazing.  Check it out."
"After a great dinner there a week ago, during which I peeked and drooled over the breakfast menu, I impulsively made a reservation for the brunch. The place was nearly empty when we showed up, and we were seated at the second floor lounge instead. The second floor is beautiful with velvet wall paper (in a different pattern from the first floor and the bathrooms), dark wood trimming, and a beautiful lounge area. Our waiter, John, recommended and explained the items on the menu. We orderedsticky bun - buttery and spongy soft, could use more sauce on top. I like my sticky buns SUPER sticky. burger with bacon - super rich and flavorful, the crunch bacon completes the textural experience. One of the best I've had.beef hash - loved the potato cubes, crunch on the outside, soft inside, topped with lightly battered and fried soft boiled duck egg. OMG.tea - Loved the tea service here. The joy of sipping tea and holding a cupful of warmth in my hands during winter is indescribable. coffee - freshly pressed and individually brewed coffee. WOW.Still great service with jokes in between, friendly yet with personality. The owner, Boa, came by and greeted the customers. Compliments to the wonderful pastry chef, Crystal! p.s. did you know the building is brand new? All custom made down to the wall paper?"
"I went here with my good friend to celebrate his new job. He was dying to try it and, after scoping out the menu online, so was I.Drinks- he got a glass of Pinot Gris wine and I opted for a vodka/tonic. The vodka they had was apparently a potato vodka. The waitress recommended it and I was glad I went with it. It was extremely smooth.Dinner- we wanted to try a variety of dishes, so we ended up ordering some ""snacks"" and ""small plates."" For snacks, we tried the spiced almonds, pot of house made pickles and the assorted house made breads. I loved the almonds and the breads. The pot of pickles was actually not only just pickles, but a pot of all different pickled veggies. I tried it, but it wasn't for me. For small plates, we chose the special that night which was a delicious gnocchi plate that had tomato chunks. That was hands down my favorite dish. This place is fabulous and I would totally go back!"
"Came here last night for the first time - just happened to be $15 for a burger, bourbon shot and a beer.  What a great deal!  The burger was awesome - I added a fried egg, cheese and bacon.  Came with ""chips"" and vinegar aioli.  I didn't love the aioli as much as others, but the fries were good.  My dining companion had the salt beef sandwich, which he said was great too.  The space is really cozy, great beer list, good food, great time overall."
"I rarely give a restaurant a bad review.  Out of 66 reviews, this is only the 3rd time I've given 2 stars or less.  THIS PLACE WAS THAT BAD.  I have to agree with the other unfavorable reviews here - I suspect Owen gets 5-stars from its own staff and from overly sympathetic friends.  Basically, two things made this place 1-star: the food and the service.First off, the beef sandwich was horrible: (1) it had practically no beef in it, just bread and a few bland veggies - in all it had practically no flavor; (2) it was way overpriced at $15; (3) if was sadly presented on a big, empty plate with a skinny, shriveled, old, pickle wedged under it.  I wouldn't waste an appetite on this sandwich again (not that it satisfied my appetite); let alone pay even one fifth of the listed price.Second, our service was repeatedly, frustratingly poor.  The room was half empty when we came in and yet they had us wait around for a while to get a table.  Once brought to our table, the waiter asked for our orders as were literally sitting down (I was thinking jokingly, no, we don't know what we want to eat, since as you can see we're being handed the menus at this very moment).  He forgot to bring our appetizer plates, and he was practically unseen after the food was tabled.In closing, I have to say I came into this place excited and optimistic.  It looked homey and old-world inside, it had a good draft list, and the owners seemed to really be trying to make a quality addition to the neighborhood.  I'm writing this review out of the hope that those same owners will take note of their poor food, step up the quality and the quantity, and tell their servers to be a bit more courteous and attentive (hence, even if yelp buries it or it gets drowned out by misleading reviewers, I bet it will still be noted by the people who work there). There are too many other good restaurants in Chicago to waste your time and money here, at least till they make some changes."
"Last Saturday was my first visit to Owen & Engine and I really only had one grumble - the location.  Its petty, I know.  O&E is located on Western 1 block south of Diversey, directly across from the Regal 14 Theater where I saw Hot Tub Time Machine, one of the finer scripts of 2010.  Anyway it's tough to hail a cab over there, even on a Saturday night.  But I guess that's really neither here nor there, especially if you live in the area and/or have a cell phone. the food & spirits..Top-notch.  We started with the charcuterie and sausage plate which was better than expected.  Typically, you order this plate and no matter where you go everyone sort of dresses it the same.  Pickled onions, hastily cut sausage, dijon mustard, salamis, so on and so forth. O&E's seemed to be a little more thoughfully put together.  The bartender was nice enough to explain the origins of the plate, which I believe is mostly in-house, could be wrong though. He also told me how their oysters are flown in daily from Cape Cod, I think.  Sorry for the vagueness.Spirits were as expected: lots of craft beers, good wine, and a wide variety of whisky.  Finally, the burger.  I believe it was a House-blend beef burger with carmelized onion.  woo-ee.  This was impressive.Anyway, you should go.  Today.  Or next week, if today is no good."
Been here 2 times once for dinner the other for brunch. The first time was within the first week they had opened. We didn't have a reservation and there was a possible 2 hour wait. EEK! We were about to decline and go elsewhere and try back at a later date. The staff started scrambling and said they could push 2 tables together and bring in a couple of chairs (there were 6 of us.) We gladly accepted. The menu is mainly pub grub with higher end ingredients (i.e. grass feed beef). I had the burger only because we were told that they had run out of fish and chips. (C'mon you ran out of fish and chips and your place is a pub? 1 star off for that!) My girlfriend had the bangers and mash. Both were well above average. Have a decent sized beer and wine list and Iike I said they went out of their way to try and accommodate us. Great first impression.For brunch we got there right as they opened. We were about to leave since the door was locked (that open at 11am I guess) Til a chipper hostess opened and said they weren't open just yet but we could come in (I believe it was just a few minutes til 11am) I had the Scottish pancakes while everyone else got the traditional English breakfast which came with Heinz baked beans. Everyone Thought their food was good and the staff really seems to not want me to leave (not that I would have held anything against them I mean having a long wait opening week should have been expected and me getting there before they opened was my fault.) Will definitely go back soon.
"I am not sure how I feel about this place.  The food was good, but it was uber pricey.  Okay, I've made up my mind.  I think it's overrated."
"I visited Owen & Engine for a late night bite and a couple of beers. I believe we arrived close to 10 p.m. right after the new year. It was a quiet night, we sat in the upstairs bar. I think they managed to do the ""pub"" thing correctly. There are televisions on the main level and it is fairly quiet so conversation is welcomed. Pubs in England do not have music (maybe some do), in fact, I've seen people reading a book sitting there with their beer. My friend and I headed upstairs, we walked past the Christmas tree, past the comfortable seating areas of the well lit room and headed to the bar. I always prefer to sit at the bar. If you've read my reviews in the past, you probably already know that i am not an easy person wait on. I ask many questions, I dislike many things and I am not easy to please. Our bartender was excellent. He was happy to answer all of my questions, even though I was worse than a third grader, he offered great feedback and he accepted my feedback.  My friend and I split a few dishes:- The chestnut soup (excellent)- The fish and chips (very good)- The bone marrow (very good)I drove that night, so I had to be careful about my alcohol intake but I wanted to try more than one beer. I asked our bartender if they offered 1/2 pints (which is totally normal in England but for some reason gastropubs here do not offer them. It's just a 1/2 glass, just pour me 1/2 the amount and charge me 1/2 the price, not that hard). My bartender at Owen & Engine was happy to oblige. Which was great because I was able to try two beers. Even though I do not venture north of North Ave., I would most certainly make an exception for Owen & Engine. I would strongly recommend this establishment and I hope to be back soon."
"My first impression of Owen & Engine, based on the menu, was admittedly apprehensive. $14 for a burger? $17 for fish and chips? Not a single glass of wine under $10? Yelp lists this as a two dollar sign place, and those are much higher prices than I anticipated.However, my initial misgivings about the price almost all but vanished when my burger showed up. I am a burger fiend. I read blogs about burgers. I look at photos of burgers and I ask questions about burgers like ""whats your meat blend"" and ""where is the beef raised"" because I am obnoxious about burgers. The Owen & Engine burger is, without hyperbole, the best burger I've had in Chicago. Maybe ever. Hands down. The grass-fed beef is, as our server said, ""the star of the show"" and comes on a potato ""bap"" bun as a ""play on meat and potatoes"".  I am trying to remember all the descriptions of the burger and its optional toppings that our encylopediac server mentioned but I simply cannot remember much after I took my first bite.  I opted for cheddar on my burger and was not disappointed. I ordered my burger medium and it came out on a plate, brimming with meat juice. I think angels were singing. The bap did a good job of holding in the impressive patty, which burst with beefy flavor. A prodigious dose of caramelized onions added umami, not that this excellent beef patty needed much. It just all added up to a perfect burger.No rabbit food on the side save for a pickle, and a generous portion of excellent crispy fries are all you get on the side. The beef really is the star of the show. My dining companions also got the burger and were rendered silent by how good it was. We shared the housemade pickles, also very good and a bright burst of acid to sometimes balance the rich burger.I reserve one star because I still am disappointed in their wine prices. They have plenty of beers on tap and many craft cocktails that look phenomenal, but if they had a wine by the glass for under $10 I would be back here eating that burger at least once a week. I'd be 400 lbs but I'd be happy.  Absolutely perfect burger."
"Solid.Service was very friendly - our server, whose name I unfortunately didn't catch, was great.  Quick and always willing to go back and get answers when we asked questions about things.  He was also really good with beer recommendations.  The food was really good - the beet salad is rather tasty with little balls of goat cheese and I also enjoyed the fontina, though you need to eat it as soon as it comes to the table to the cheese doesn't solidify.  The duck was enjoyable, the fish stew was quite well-liked, as was the fish and chips, and the pasty was rather delicious.  The pickled, curried veggies that came with the pasty (which wasn't even my dinner) was the best thing we had.  The regular appetizer order of pickles is pretty fantastic, too - pickled pear is not something I would have though to work but it did, quite nicely.  The bubble and squeak was a big hit, too - the added veggies gave a nice texture to what would otherwise be plain old mashed potatoes, which are a very good thing, but even better with other veggies in there.  We also tried each of the desserts and the only thing in the meal that I didn't love was in one of the desserts - there was a sort of minty pesto that had a blue cheese of some sort in there and the mint was just really not a good complement to the dish.  The cake was good, though, and we also really liked the apple buckle (tasty syrup with this!) and the pumpkin cake, which had a lovely little pepita brittle with it.  In close second place to the pickled, curried veggies with the pasty, the toasted brioche cinnamon toast was rather quite to die for.  Sweet and crunchy - it comes with the hot chocolate but so very good!The decor is really comfortable and very much like other actual pubs I've been in in England.  The temperature was a bit on the freezing cold side but it worked out ok.  I do note that there are quite a few steps going to the upstairs dining room so something to keep in mind if you have problems with steps.Overall, a great experience and I hope we get to go back again soon!"
"You know that episode of My So-Called Life where Angela totally thinks Jordan Catalano is going to hang out with her at the Buffalo Tom show?  So she gets all prettied up and gets out of her curfew and goes to the show with her friends, and he gives her the cold shoulder?That's what Owen & Engine did to me, man.  Not cool.We first tried Owen & Engine on a slow Thursday night.  Dinner was great, the restaurant looks really cool, and the beer list was awesome.  Service was top notch--really polite and accommodating.  That's why we told our friends all about it, and attempted to bring one of them out with us last Saturday night for a second round.I'm not even going to pretend that we didn't expect there to be a wait, possibly a long wait.  The place has gotten popular.  I know how that works on Saturdays.  We planned to spend a little time at one of the two bars having some drinks before we got a table.  But when we came in the door, the girl behind the podium just kind of stared at us like she was disappointed.  ""How many?  Three?""  She looked down at her list.  Then she made a noise that was kind of like ""eww"" and kind of like ""ohhh.""  It came out like ""Uuuuuuuggghhhh...I gotta say?  The way things are going right now?  It's probably not gonna happen.""Um.  What?""Yeah, it's just like, super busy.""I know a lot of people who have served as host staff.  I've also been to a lot of restaurants.  So I know that the last thing you want to do is turn people away AT THE DOOR.  ""Yeah, forget it, not gonna happen for you.  I'd give you some options but there are none.""So we noticed a large table clearing, the patrons left.  I asked the hostess if people at the bar would be taking that table, and then we could have the open seats at the bar.  She responded ""People at the bar are waiting for that table, but you could eat at the bar?""  Like it was this brand new idea, like she'd just had this epiphany that yes, YES!  There actually IS a way that you could patronize this establishment tonight!  What a thought!  She then added ""I mean, I COULD take your names down.  Crazy things happen sometimes.  You never know, hahahahah!"" By that, I'm assuming she meant that something would happen to move us forward in her exhaustive line of people waiting for a table (we were the only group standing, there were only 2 people actually standing at the bar--plenty of room).  She was kind enough to finally take our names, then she said ""Now, I won't hold it against you guys if you decide to leave.""At that, we turned on our heels and were out of there faster than a gastropub can even materialize in Logan Square.  Screw that place.  Sure, you're busy, I get that.  But this is just another case of one of these cookie-cutter gastropubs disregarding customer service because who cares what the people on the fringe think, as long as there's butts in the seats?  So crank that Portishead, bartenders: tighten your matching suspenders, and let's all take a jaunt down to foggy London town!  But you can't come, there aren't any seats on the double decker bus at this very moment, and I'm not really interested in keeping you as a customer.  I'm totally cool with it if you leave.(We just went to Lula instead, where they have control over their dining room every second of a busy night, and they WILL get you in.  Tried and true.)"
"I keep downgrading my review because of my recent experience.  Horrible customer service.  I finally got a call back from Tracie, the event person, to make a reservation for a small group.  This was over a week after my first message.  In total I left 2 voicemails, 2 emails through the website, and three messages with people that answered the phone.  One of the people said she was there but couldn't talk.  She said that she never got the messages until the last one and my latest Yelp comments.  Apparently the place has been booked for small/large groups for two months.1. Do I believe she didn't get any of the messages: No.  Remember that one of them was supposedly left while she was working the bar.  If she didn't get the messages than someone else there isn't doing their job.2. Do I believe that the place has been booked for larger groups for two months: yes 3. Do I think this is an example of horrible customer service: yes4. Will I eat there again:  probably notBottom line is that if she ignored the messages than the service sucks.  If someone didn't give them to her, the service sucks.  Either way, bad customer service.  Did I mention that I also sent two emails to Tracie directly?  It was a work email, so she may not have checked them.  Even if you're booked, at least have the courtesy of returning a call.  Clearly someone there gets these reviews, bec she referenced my recent complaint.  If you work at Owen Engine and are reading this, I hope you learn from this."
"Happy Birthday to MEEEEEEE!!!!!  The hubby and friends surprised me with a brunch at O&E.  At first me thinks, ok pub food....really? Do you people know me at all?  I mean yes I am a lover of wings, but otherwise, do not take me to a pub for my birthday.  And yet, I was pleasantly surprised.  Read on.First off, it's great inside. Built from the ground up and designed thoughtfully from the coffee cup to the velour wallpark in the bathroom (yes I felt the wall while in there...then almost immediately wondered how many others before me had done the same thing...good thing this place is relatively new.)  Being not an expert of English food, let me just comment on food in general - I've eaten a darn lot of it in my almost 28 years, so let's stick with that. I think I saw an angry Brit saying it wasn't authentic English and what an embarassment to the cuisine...I dont know anything about that or what was alleged.  I think everything was delicious.  Ok maybe the crumpets weren't all that, but then there were the sticky buns, oh sticky buns.  Ymmmm....so sticky and coated with Lyle's Golden Syrup.  If you've never tried the stuff, let me tell you, I didn't think were was a sticky substance more tasty than maple syrup but there is.  And you can order it online and pour it on pancakes, ice cream, and sticky buns apparently! I digress...I like freebies. You get freebies when you order stuff at O&E, and it's a delightful surprise.  When you order coffee, it comes in a beautiful Englishy coffee cup and saucer, in your own perfectly portioned french press with tasty Metropolis coffee and a little cookie. When you order the hot chocolate, it comes in tea pot and is accompanied by 4 slices of cinnamon sugar brioche bread, how cute and thoughtful.The beef and hash is delicious, with a boiled whole egg that is then encrusted and fried. Also very simple but good is the Scottish Pancakes. The bacon is very thinly cut and crispy. I like crispy bacon so I'm happy. Oh! And I forgot the most important part. The bloody mary is delicious - quite spiked (but I didn't seem to mind, hello I'm drunk at 11am), and garnished with a home-made pickled celery stick. My one complaint would be, give me another pickled celery stick, and a couple more garnishses...I like my bloody mary to be like a meal.All in all a great place. Perfect for a dinner and a movie sord of how Pequod's is perfect for dinner and a movie.  Check it out, cheerio ol' chap!"
"I'm going to be honest here, under normal circumstances I would never set foot into this establishment.  It is completely contrived, expensive enough it could be considered over priced, pretentious and caters to fashionista honkys in white boots bringing their screaming devil spawn to brunch. In other words this joint is the opposite of everything I like in a bar and/or breakfast joint but I am still compelled to give it four stars in spite of all this.Why?  Three words:Full. English. Breakfast.Since Martyrs stopped Sunday brunch this is the best English breakfast I have found in Chicago.  This alone would be enough to garner high praise from me but it is just the tip of the delicious breakfast iceberg for Owen and Engine.  Their menu, beyond the English fry up, contains several other amazing English brunch standards such as Bangers and Mash, Bubble and Squeak and even a Ploughman's Lunch as well as and amazing beef hash that comes with a deep fried egg.The Egg itself deserves a special mention of it's own; it is basically a soft boiled egg breaded and fried into a delicious golden brown, soft yolk filled orb of awesome.The food here is amazing, the service excellent but you need to be prepared to dig a little deeper into pocket then you normally do for  breakfast/brunch and be prepared to put up with a gaggle of honkys with designer strollers discussing the merits of various SUVs.Oh, and I feel I should mention, lest Owen and Engine management read this...  I would have rated 5 stars if not for their complete and total lack of bike racks; I had to lock up across the street at the movie theater."
Quality beer and very good food.A very nice restaurant that does upscale pub life in comfortable fashion.  We split the burger which is made with ground sirloin and brisket with the 10 ounce filet.  Everything was cooked to perfection and we didn't leave a bite on the plates.The beer selection is pretty incredible.  Four different selection of cask brews with two that are not available anywhere else in the United States.  Quality local and national micro-breweries on tap with a selection that you normally can't find.Go here.  Enjoy it.PS - they make their own ketchup.
"YOU CANNIBAL, YOU MEAT-EATER, YOU SEE......Ended up here when stupid Grahamwich was closed....slightly different dining experience, but glad we made the trek!Hostess-ok, we called to get a reservo for 745....walk in at lik 730.  Mean asian hostess & nice man hostess....nice man hostess tries to tell us that we can go have a drink at the bar and our table will be ready soon.  Mean asian hostess says ""the table will be ready at 745"" (mind you no expression on her face).  Ok then....off to have some fun beers at the bar!  Great selection and they will let you taste if you arent sure.  Very knowledgeable bartender and cute to boot.Get our table upstairs at 8PM (I shouldve complained to the mean asian lady, but was enjoying my beer and convo too much to cause drama).  I LOVE the decor in this place....everything was perfect....leather, paisley or something on the walls matched the menus, matched the check, etc.Waitress was nice...didnt really give any suggestions on what to have until we asked her.  We tried ordering the oysters, pork rinds & salad to start....I hate oysters (the one thing that I really dont like) and these were not any different.  However, I have to say the people I was with also said that they were not good and very fishy.  BLAH!  The pork rinds were 86'd in the kitchen (BOO, I have never had these so they were insisting that we order them....so I was bummed when I couldnt try them) so we ended up with the chicken wings.  AH-MAZ-ING!  I dont even really like chicken wings but they were tastey.  The salad was refreshing but nothing too exciting.  Next we split the fish & chips, ribeye, & bubbles n squeaks....YUMMY!  The fish and chips were amazing.  I think I ate 18oz of the 20oz ribeye....sick, but sooo good.  I couldnt stop.  Also, the bubbles n squeak was FABULOUS!  All of it pretty darn good.A little pricey but good food, pretty good service and a great little vibe going on.  Skip the oysters and avoid the mean hostess.....then you will be good :)"
"Loved it. Food was amazing. Service was good. My only reservation was that I had to ask for toast points to accompany the bone marrow. WTF?! That's like ordering soup and having to ask for a spoon. Aside from that- great. Oysters were great. Fish stew was excellent, complete with shrimp heads for sucking. Lamb was perfect. GF had a burger. Best burger I've ever tasted. No cheese. Sasion duponts, bookers manhattans, and pappy van winkles nice and neat! 4.5 stars. 0.5 of a michlien."
"I really liked this place! Don't judge it by outside or location because the inside is really cool...Dark/Classy/Fireplaces/Warm! I really liked the Wallpaper upstairs-believe it or not! We started in the Liquor Dept--Very ""Healthy"" Beer List complete with 4 ""Cask"" offerings!? Damn--have seen 1 or 2 at a few places but not 4? Drink menu very nice as well-prices seemed about average for this nice of a joint. Started with a couple Apps--""Coddled Egg"" and ""Wings""--Both were very well done in terms of flavor and presentation! The Coddled Egg being the better of the two--Amazing! For ""Mains"" we tried the Famed Burger and Fish & Chips--they both lived up to the hype...Burger is very flavorful as it is ground Sirloin/Brisket/Chuck I think? Def a different taste to say the least! Dessert was an Old Fashioned but I'm sure they have nice offerings. BTW, this place is owned by same people that own Fat Willys--you do the math!! PS--Sit Upstairs if your hiding and they have Mallort's!! GTFJD"
"Always wanted to try this place and I finally got my chance! The beer menu here is excellent, and the wait staff is super attentive and, dare I say, cute. They have an upstairs area that is primarily for dining and a downstairs area for dining and drinking. I ordered a Hairy Eyeball and it was absolutely great - at $5, it was worth it. The interior of this place is awesome, and it's a casual vibe which I appreciate. It's well-lit and I hear that the bathroom towels are awesome. Definitely would want to come back to try the food sometime!"
"I came here on a Saturday night with no reservation.  My bf and I got incredibly lucky...someone canceled their reservation right as we walked in. Otherwise we would've had to wait 2 hours.  So make a reservation.This place gets 4 stars b/c it has great ambiance.  It made me feel like I wasn't in Chicago anymore and it's a place where you want to have several beers with friends and hang out.  They have a great beer selection...I enjoyed their Apricot IPA. Tasty.I ordered the fish and chips upon several other Yelpers recommendations.  Personally, I prefer cod over haddock.  I know others may disagree but the haddock, which this place serves was a lil too slimy for me.  Also, I appreciate a lot of tartar sauce and here they gently top your fish with it.  However, they did use a pea puree which was unique. So, the fish and chips receive 3 stars.The fries were good with garlic aioli.  The pork rinds aren't worth it.  They need more flavor/spice.The service was great and extremely friendly.  I will be coming back here."
"Please hold my wake at O&E. This pub/restaurant has the perfect combination of great food, a great bar, and the comfort of a place that feels like home.Start with the Shrubbery cocktail, a scotch and bitters combo that is perfect.  Have a scotch egg or the house pretzel with it.With all the great classic pub dishes like Fish and Chips or Bangers and Mash, it's easy to overlook some of their other entrees, but don't. The Amish Chicken with beets and Brussels Sprouts may be the best item on the menu.  The Bubble and Squeak side dish is huge and delicious, and can be shared.I love this place..."
"Love this place and it really is that good. The dining room does tend to get busy, so come at off peak hours."
"Ugh, totally disappointed.Worst part was the guy creeping around the area and lingering around my table with nothing to say. The entire time trying to force horrible small talk. Not Interested Dude!I later find out he is the Cicerone. Not once did he mention beer to me. Doubt I will go back for another overpriced, sub par dinner. Perhaps for a drink before a movie though."
"I eat a lot of burgers, and have high standards for them. Owen and Engine manages to meet and exceed said expectations. We had some appetizers for the table, which our server recommended; fried scotch egg, and duck meatballs with saag paneer. Both of these are updated, inventive takes on conventionally bland British fare. The show stealer here, however, is the truly exceptional hamburger. The menu option ($14) is served simply, on a housemade bun with caramelized onions. I added bacon and a fried egg, because apparently all of the time I've spent taking care of people with strokes and heart disease has yet to influence my eating habits. The meat is actually cooked to order, and the patty stays in one piece as you eat it. The bun is good but not slathered in grease so as to overpower the other ingredients. Fried egg is not cooked to death, and the yolk runs down the side of the burger as soon as you press on the top of the bun, which is an auspicious sign. Bacon is cracker-crisp, and very salty but delicious. Add a little Colman's mustard, and that's all you need. O&E seems to grasp the concept that hamburgers are hamburgers, not canvasses for a Jackson Pollack-esque array of toppings. Bravo!The beer list at O&E is very good, with a restrained selection; they offer enough beers that everyone can have something they like, but not so many as to overwhelm the diner. The beers offered here are generally well-thought out. Pricing is a touch steep, especially for a pub in the bumfuck part of Bucktown, but it's well worth it. Be prepared to wait on weekends; our party waited about 90 minutes, but I almost forgot about it because the burger was so good. All in all, Owen and Engine is a great pub. This burger probably ties Au Cheval for second best in Chicago, in my book anyway"
"A haiku:Loved the beer, the foodI wish it weren't so close tothe shitty Target"
"Ok Yelp, here it goes, my first review...We went to Owen and Engine with a group of 13. Because of the size of our group, we got a semi-private room upstairs. I didn't make the reservation, but it was a great setup for a group that size. We also split the bill at the end of the night and they were happy to do that for us.The ambiance was pretty cool and almost felt like you were eating at someones house rather than a restaurant. Walking to our table we passed by an area upstairs that felt like a living room with cool vintage furniture and a huge fireplace. The menu was fairly basic, mainly upscale English bar food. We had the charcuterie and housemade pickles for appitizers. Both were good. I'd probably try something different if I went back, but that's because I'd rather try new things when I repeat at a restaurant. For an entree I got the steak sandwich and my fiance got the fish and chips and we did the old switch halfway through move. I really liked the steak sandwich a lot, although I wish is had been warm. The fish and chips were really good. The chips (fries) were especially good and I really liked the malt vinegar aioli dipping sauce. If mayo is not your thing, they will bring you ketchup (which tasted homemade). All in all, I was happy with the food and it was about what I expected going in.A couple things I should mention. The drink service was painfully slow at the beginning of dinner. We were told the bartender had a lot of drink orders, but even our beers took over 20 minutes to come. Also, the location is kinda weird. I knew it was in Logan Square and I always pictured it being on the square. It's actually on Western right across from the movie theater. Kind of feels out of place...Overall, I really liked it and plan to go back at some point in the future."
"I don't feel I can give this place a fully accurate review without having tasted the food (all I can say is that it SMELLED delicious anyway!). We just drank here but wow, this is a great little place.I am always hesitant to come to these types of little places because I am afraid my regular choice in beer will make them laugh me out of the joint. That was not to be at Owen & Engine. The bartender asked what kind of beer I normally drink, and after hearing it, she quickly drew up a few shot glasses full of things for me to sample. And, I did find one that I liked. I am proud of myself that with the encouragement from places like this AND many, many ""beer-snob"" friends,  that I always find something to drink when there is no ""nationally-known"" name brand beer in bottles in the bar's coolers. We took up spots at the bar upstairs. It's not a huge place, and reminds me of someone's nicely-decorated antique home with the cool wallpaper, dark setting, wood floors and leather furniture. The crowd seemed to be 20's-30's and a bit hipper than I, but then again I must remember that I am used to bars in the metro Detroit area. I settle for dive sports bars and $2 beers because, well, there aren't a lot of cool joints like this in the 'burbs! (and there's nothing wrong with that!)Our bartender Tracie on Friday night... thank you for being 100% NON-pretentious. She also served us up a lovely pink shot concoction that had a lemon flavor, vodka, and tiny little chips of ice....it was so good!"
"Owen & Engine stands out in this area because it's so darn fancy. Stepping through the door, you are no longer in the Logan Square/Bucktown border area, a block away from 90/94. Rather, you are in Merry Ole England at a posh pub. Right-o! Boyfriend and I were seated in booth. From there, we had a good view of the rest of the restaurant. The main level has several tables and a small bar area. Behind the bar were two gentlemen who (based on my mad eavesdropping skills) were quite knowledgeable of the beer offerings. Both of us started with a cask ale - a pumpkin ale for me and a scotch ale for Boyfriend. These ales are hand pumped from casks in the basement and are slightly warmer and less-carbonated than your average beer. I loved my pumpkin ale and was torn between ordering another and trying something new. Our server apparently read my mind because she stopped by at that moment to offer a special pumpkin beer they'd just gotten in. Delish. To start, we split the charcuterie plate. I'm usually not about mysterious red meats, but this selection of sausages and mustards was quite scrumptious. We decided to be traditional in our entree choices. I had the fish and chips and Boyfriend did the bangers and mash. Both were quite well done. My fish had a perfect flaky crust and the chips - well, who doesn't like chips? For dessert, we split the chocolate trifle (when in ""England,"" one must). Creamy chocolate with a crunchy topping - it was the perfect size to share. While there are a few seats at the bar (and more upstairs if it's not rented out for a private party), people coming across the street from the theatre may be disappointed. Owen & Engine is more of a sit-down-for-a-nice-dinner place than a grab-a-quick-drink-before-the-show place. Whereas other bars/pubs let you wander in and pull up a stool, here, you are seated by a host when you enter. Not a negative, necessarily, but something keep in mind when planning your night out."
"Great burgers , great beer selection , great bourbon.  Nice layout. Good service. This place is a destination."
Was there last night for the 3 B's. Burger bourbon and beer. They were all tasty.
"I've been waiting for this place to open and when it did, it took a long time for me to get here.  We came here on a Friday night with cousins for a late dinner. We arrived and was quoted an hour and a half wait. We moved upstairs to their bar area and got a few beverages while waiting,  We even got lucky and snagged with big overstuffed leather couch.  When we got seated, we were greeted by a friendly server.  After water and refilling beverages, we ordered the charcuterie to start.  The pate was the highlight of the tray. Dinner was two fish and chips, burger and cauliflower soup.  The fish and chips was the best I have had.  Other places that serve fish and chips tend to have too much batter and very little fish.  This was the complete opposite. All fish and very minimal batter.  It was flaky and very light. I love the interior of this place.  It's all wooden table and chairs on the first level and the upstairs is overstuffed chairs, couch and a mix of tables and chairs.  My husband said it is exactly like pubs in England.  The food was amazing and I can't wait to have their pot of tea with scones."
"Came here yesterday and loved absolutely everything. Scotch egg, that my husband convinced me to eat, was superb! Burger medium rare was really medium rare and was absolutely amazing. Very simple, great flavors, not overwhelmed by toppings. Great choice. I liked the service, i liked the food and cocktails and really felt like I was in a pub in London once again!"
"This place is awesome!  Loved the Fish and Chips!  The upstairs room is very cozy, and romantic.  Great service and excellent and unique beer selection.  Will come back for sure!"
"Forget English Teatime- Hello English Brunch!We started with French-Pressed Metropolis coffee and tea, as well as a trio of scones, still warm of course, and fresh ,house made, brown bread topped with lox, capers and onions.  In the past I have found traditional brown bread to be tough,but not here, it was pillowy and wonderful!Three of us split two main courses; Eggs Benedict and Salt Beef Hash.  The Eggs Benedict had an English flare by using rashers (lean bacon) instead of bacon and a crumpet rather than an English muffin.  Wow do those Brits know what they are doing- crumpets are fabules!  The Salt Beef Hash was another winner; rather than a mushy blob of hash, we were served freshly chipped (?) beef- chunks that reminded me of corned beef but cooked more, amazingly crisp breakfast potatoes everything was toped with O&E's version of a Scotch egg, using a goose egg, which was still runny in the middle. You can only imagine the deliciousness of mixing these items together.  We also had a side of ""bubble and squeak"".  Classic pub food made out of the previous night's mashed potatoes and veggies- a great side dish out of leftoversThere is an amazing upstairs area with leather bound furniture and a fireplace and a bar.  I cant wait to visit on cold winter nights!"
"My wife and I came here for Sunday Brunch with a friend. We were seated upstairs, on a positive note , it looked like an authentic British Pub, but it was cold, this set the tone for the meal.We ordered a couple of ""fry ups"" and some sides, now a full English breakfast requires little to no culinary expertise to get right, it's basic. So for a $15 price tag, you expect two things, good ingredients and good execution, unfortunately there were neither.Some ingredients were cold, while some were hot, my companions kept asking, ""is this meant to be cold?"" The baked beans, the part that's meant to marry everything else together were cold, we sent them back to be reheated, not only that but they were hard, suggesting they hadn't even been cooked correctly in the first place. C'mon you can get 'Heinz' baked beans at the local supermarket for $2 a tin, all you have to do is heat them up and they would be infinitely better than what was on offer.Bacon, in Britain we eat a different cut of bacon, back bacon, I know you can get it in Chicago, so serving up a rock solid , cold slice of generic supermarket bacon is unforgivable for a $15 price tag.Tomato, cold, toast, cold, sausage and black pudding were ok and an egg,  an egg right?, cold.The sides were good, all warm and tasty, especially the chips and scotch egg.Service was bad, there was one guy on his own up there, we waited 20mins for a coffee and the food arrived about 1 hour after we entered, 30 mins after we ordered.I imagine that Owen and Engine put some good food out, but I'll never know as I won't return, if you can't get the basics right then you don't deserve a second chance in my book."
"The inhabitants of Great Britain have been drinking ale since the Bronze Age, but it was with the arrival of the Romans and the establishment of the Roman road network that the first Inns called tabernae, in which the traveller could obtain refreshment, began to appear. After the departure of Roman authority and the fall of the Romano-British kingdoms, the Anglo-Saxons established alehouses that grew out of domestic dwellings. The Anglo-Saxon alewife would put a green bush up on a pole to let people know her brew was ready. These alehouses formed meeting houses for the locals to meet and gossip and arrange mutual help within their communities. Here lie the beginnings of the modern pub. They became so commonplace that in 965 King Edgar decreed that there should be no more than one alehouse per village.Owen & Engine is but one alehouse among many in Chicago, however it is easily among the finest.  The beer selection is astonishingly broad, including four rotating beers served straight from the cask, medieval style, slightly chilled and extremely delicious.In addition, the food can only really be described as 'pub gourmet'.  We had an order of the wings, which are most probably not worth $10, but were extremely delicious anyway, with an amazing crispy crust outside a perfectly cooked interior, and served with creme fraiche that finally sated my need for a creamy dipping sauce with wings that doesnt involve ranch or blue cheese.The real highlight though was the burger.  Oh, the burger!  Toasty potato bun sandwiching a perfectly sized handmade patty which consists of four (4?!) different types of beef.  I believe it was ground chuck, sirloin, brisket, and crack.  Or possibly the fourth one was ground flank steak instead of crack.  Then some caramelized onions and topped with melty english cheddar cheese.  What went so right?  I don't know.  I certainly know that the first bite I took of this burger was quite possibly the best burger bite I have ever experienced."
"I have been to this place before for dinner, but brunch is the real masterpiece here.   First off, I love the true English set up- the sugar bowl  with sugar cubes and the tea sets were right on the money.  I was i pressed with that alone but then you have a piece of short bread too.  Impressive and what a great little sweet treat.  The coffee was amazing and done in a press which just made the experience more over the top.   The English Fry Up- you have to get this.   Lastly, the mini scones and dessert options were enough to make me feel like I  needed a wheel barrel to get home.  Best brunch in a long time."
"My friend and I came here on a Friday night. I was concerned about getting a table so I made a reservation, but the place wasn't packed so the reservation wasn't really necessary. I really liked the ambiance and decor of this place. The dark colors, low lighting and wood make for a cozy and intimate dining experience. We ate in a room upstairs that had stuffed leather chairs and a fire place. It reminded me of the living room of a British hunting lodge. The service was very friendly and attentive. We never had to ask for anything and the waiter was eager to answer any questions we had. We started with a dozen oysters. They were fresh and delicious, but the ones from the east coast were the best. I had the pims cup to drink (the O & E). It was clean and refreshing and I ended up getting two of them. This is a perfect summer drink. For dinner I had the rib eye steak. It was well seasoned and cooked perfectly and the fries with malt aioli vinegar were perfect. My friend had the bangers and mash and these were spot on. They actually make their own sausages. I think I will get this next time i go back. Overall, this was a very pleasant dining experience. I think things were a tad pricey, but the service and food quality were on par with the price. They have a fantastic beer list that I'd like to explore in more depth."
"Ate here for the second time last night and basically its catapulted itself into one of my favorites bars.  I'm going to miss this place when I move out of Logan Square.  The beer list is aweomse; anything for a novice beer drinker to a veteran hop-head.  Last night they had 4 beers on cask along with a dozen or others on tap.  Bottle selection is great too...The food:  This place is going for a British feel with dark tones, tight corridors, and fancily dressed servers and hosts; the food fits the mold and then blows it up.  If you enjoy fish and chips; a hearty burger; bangers and mash-type food, then you're an idiot for not already eating there.Tip:  They take reservations and I highly recommend making one."
"My fiance and I absolutely loved Owen and Engine!  It's walking distance from our condo and the feel is quaint and homey unlike the Irish pub feeling of many bars and restaurants in Chicago. (I lived in Dallas for quite some time, so the atmosphere reminded me of a more upscale pub/eatery in the nicer neighborhoods there).We instantly ordered the two recommended items--fish and chips and the sirloin burger.The fish and chips were great, the batter was light and the fish was fresh with tartar sauce and smashed peas underneath (weird, but strangely good).  We also ordered the burger (which I guess is a mixture of brisket and sirloin formed into a burger) with cheese and bacon on it.  The homemade bun it was on was AMAZING--rivaling Kuma or some of my other faves in the city.Both meals came with french fries served with mayonnaise in a pint cup.We totally finished both of our meals.  The fish and chips were to die for and some of the best I've had in Chicago so far.  The burger was extremely tasty and my fiance later told me it is THE best burger he's had in the city and he plans to take his best friend there later this weekend.The ONLY reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because I tend to eat fairly healthy and our food was definitely on the heavy side.  I would not suggest eating here if you're on a diet, although next time we go (which will be very soon), I'll look over the menu for something with a bit more nutritional value.There is also an outdoor balcony/patio on the second floor, that is small, but very neat.Our service was great for dinner and the other time we stopped in for a beer before the movie.  We will return here and bring friends and family--an all around unique place to go, with a stellar atmosphere!  I look forward to exploring the menu further."
"This is NOT how they do things in England. How would I know? Have I ever been to England? No, I haven't -- but that's not what's important right now. Before I go on, I want to address the prevalence of the ""&"" (ampersand) symbol in the name of every one of these so-called ""gastropubs"" that are sneaking around town, springing-up surreptitiously on every street corner in Chicago... Hold on, I think I hear a gastropub coming down the street right now. Wait, let me check... Yep, sure enough.. What's that? You wanna turn MY apartment into a gastropub? We'll talk later.But really,"" Longman & Eagle?"" ""Girl & the Goat?"" ""Owen & Engine?"" Excuse me, but wouldn't it be more fun if they were called ""Longmen & Eagles"" or ""Owens and Engines?"" Ha, ""Girls and Goats.""Seriously, you can take any restaurant name and add an ""&"" and suddenly it's a gastropub. ""Burger King?"" No.""Burger & King??"" BAM! A gastropub!Isn't gastropub a British kind of concept? If so, I guess Owen & Engine deserves to be called one despite the questionable ampersand.I had ""bangers and mash"", which gets a quotation mark because I feel uncomfortable saying it with a straight face. Really it was bland sausage. But the mashed potatoes on the side outshone the sausages. Delicious!I thought the one cocktail I had -- the Kentucky Blackhawk -- was overly-sweet and also too lemony. If you want to hide the taste of Buffalo Trace, that's the way to do it.I caught a whiff of some fish 'n chips going to the table next to us. Next time I'm getting that. And a beer from one of the time machine contraptions from behind the bar. I have a feeling they're good enough for me to up my review to four out of five.Here's my point: food like this is better if they don't put so much thought into it. Where I payed fifteen dollars for sausage and mashed potatoes at Owen & Engine, I feel like I'd get a more satisfying version for less money at a greasy-spoon diner, or hell -- a real pub in real England. But I don't know.I get that the whole point of gastropub food: it's bar fare fancied up, but that only works at somewhere like Longman & Eagle -- where they imitate AND innovate. Owen & Engine just imitates as far as I can tell. British pub eats made worse with expensive ingredients.But I had a good time. The place is comfy, the food is more than edible -- it's good. But I can't see how it's better than the real thing."
"This place is flippin awesome! My husband went here first and then had to take me...2 days later!As many have said, the fish and chips is superb. The fries are perfectly seasoned and they come with ridiculously delicious malt vinegar aioli. The fish is so flavorful and so so SO soft. It's more like tempura batter.But the real highlight was the banofee pie. Oh my f-bomb. Toffee, banana, chocolate goodness with a homemade Graham cracker. Order it. NOW.And to top it all off, the servers and bartenders are very friendly, talkative, and knowledgable. My husband made friends with Rich, a bartender, and he took care of us the second time too! Other recommendations from the staff include the toffee pudding, pickles, and ribeye.AND $2 parking next door at the movie theater. You don't need to show them a movie ticket stub like the sign says. Just give them 2 bucks and you're good! Bartender informed us that sometimes the attendants leave the gate up while they're smoking and you can snag free parking! Happened for us!All in all, you need to go. Now."
"Came in on a Tuesday not knowing that Tuesdays was the burger special night. Thus the wait was 45 minutes, but we managed to get a seat at the bar. So, I obviously had to order the burger special, which honestly was one of the better burgers I've ever had and easily one of the best (if not the best) in Chicago. The crust was awesome on the outside and the inside was cooked perfectly medium-rare as I requested. I also didn't ask for any toppings or cheese, so it was simply: house-made potato bun, burger with caramelized onions. And you know what? Nothing else was needed. The burger was oozing with so much grease and butter that it required no condiments. It also came with some delicious fries that were again cooked perfectly and served with some tasty aioli. I washed it down with the amber ale and shot that were included and was a pretty happy dude. Oh yeah, and the draft beer selection ain't no joke..."
"Bloody hell, any twit who doesn't fancy the Burger at Owen & Engine is a potty wanker!  Sorry, my only exposure to British slang is from Guy Ritchie movies...Regardless of which version of English you prefer, there's no doubting that this little British gastropub serves one of the finest burgers this city has to offer.  And when I say ""finest"", I'm talking top 5 - maybe even top 3 - on my personal list.  What makes this burger so fine you ask?  It starts and ends with the beef.  O&E sources their beef locally from Slagel Farms then does an in-house grind on equal parts brisket, short rib, and chuck.  Net result is a loosely packed patty that's big on beef flavor with an added touch of richness that you would typically get from a well marbled steak.  It's borderline decadent.  When you have a foundation that good there's really no need to pile on an excessive number of toppings.  Kudos to the chefs at O&E for being smart enough to keep things simple by only adding caramelized onions for a touch of sweetness, and I also opted for some English Cheddar to round out the flavors with a little sharpness.  The homemade Potato bun was nice and light, with just the right amount of toasting to stand up to all the juicy goodness.  While I'm usually partial to pretzel buns, the potato bun was really the spot on choice as it kept the spotlight on the beef, right where it belonged.  The fries (or is it chips?) were very good as well - crisp on the outside, fluffy on the inside, and well seasoned.  The wifey was hoping for Fish & Chips for her dinner, but they had already sold out for the evening.  She settled on the Spatchcock, which was good but on its own was slightly over-salted.  The sweetness of the Sunchoke puree was almost required in each bite to balance out that strong savory flavor.  O&E also sports a healthy beer list to wash down their delicious grub.  In keeping with the British pub theme, I decided to choose from one of their four cask ale options.  Cask ales are probably the last thing you'd think of when looking to crack open a cold one, but the warmth and richness of my Two Brothers Stout proved to be the perfect choice on this chilly winter night.  Even with the over-salted chicken, we still had an enjoyable experience.  I already plan on going back to try the Fish & Chips, and will most definitely return for that fine fine burger."
"Love the atmosphere here.  I guess I'm an anglophile.  My wife and I enjoyed a date here on a Saturday.  Be warned: This place is tiny.  There's an upstairs and a downstairs, but precious little space in either.  We started out with cocktails on the couch while our table was made ready.   All told, I probably had 3 cocktails, and was optimistic about each one, but not a single one of them was impressive enough to remember the name.As for entrees, we had the fish and chips - about the best I have had in the US - and the bacon sandwich.  This was outstanding.  Served with Arugula and an over-easy egg.I'll definitely recommend it, but I'd recommend you stick to beers as I should have."
"Owen and Wilson (that's right, I won't even use the right name and made up something stupid) has diappointed me so much to earn the rarest sanction in my repertoire: the ""No-Return"". I'll give the staff one thing, though, which is that they tried to make it right after initially being curt and boarderline uncouth.First, these famous fish & chips were nowhere to be found because they were out by the 9pm seating on a Friday. After making us wait at the bar near the narrowest bar-to-seating-area intersection ever for an hour, they seated us at a table on the other side of the narrowness to balance us out, I suppose. We had witnessed several fish & chips platters leave the kitchen while at the bar, and were then informed once seated by our waitress that they were out of them.Normally, I'd chalk that up to the late seating, and the waitress did attempt to make the justification that they were always fresh and flown in daily, and the place did not over-order because of the maintenance of freshness on the items (i.e. They refuse to freeze any excess in order to serve it the next day so as to maintain freshness standards.). However, she made us know that it was our fault for living and not getting there earlier. In order to have the manager even address the issue, one of our bolder diners had to speak with the hostess.Now normally when you have a special item or specials, where you fly in the ingreedients, you list for patrons that it is out when they walk into the place, or at least cross it off the chalk board. Nope. Here they let us spend good money on beer before they informed us.And I even would have understood that I had come in and they'd just exhausted their compliment, BUT HERE'S THE KICKER: the bearded, suspender-wearing manager LIED!! While sitting there, two platters of Fish & Chips went out 20 minutes after we'd been told they were out. I'm sorry, but assuming those orders were in even as we sat, Fish & Chips don't take 20 min. to prepare. Hence, I don't care how good your food is, you're a bunch of liars, and I would've ordered your touted special at the bar had I known you'd run out of it in time to lie to me about it.I shan't return. You don't deserve a second chance. Your stout cake  dessert tasted like burnt chocolate, and your fat, bearded manager lied right to my face."
"Hello Tuesday nights! Burger, beer and a shot of whiskey?! Count me in.I went with clients and they are still raving. We sat at the bar and the bartenders could not have been more friendly or attentive. Order the duck meatballs, you will not be disappointed. We also had the pickle jar which included pickled everything: onions, mushrooms, grapes, mango, peppers....yum! I had never heard of this place prior to going there...but glad we stumbled upon it!"
"As I was enjoying my fish and chips, surrounded by dark Edwardian furnishings, I glanced out the window.  It was momentarily jarring to see the date couples loitering outside of the City North 14 movie theatre, as if aliens had scooped up a slice of dear old Blighty and dropped it in front of a suburban American cineplex.  So it goes with that corner of Logan Square: Fat Willie's Rib Shack does it's own quasi-authentic southside thing down the block.  Owen & Engine is beautifully furnished, and the service is attentive and well-informed.  This is a fine dining establishment--a English style gastro-pub.  At O&E, an ordinarily humble menu item of fish and chips start with haddock flown in daily from the coast, and salt and sugar cured in-house. It was the best I've ever had: flaking into bite-sized tender, sweet chunks.  Presentation is especially nice. My dinner partner had barley mushroom soup.  It arrived as a coulis or gruel of the solid ingredients, and the waiter poured hot broth on top of it.  The soup also came with rich, savory french toast points.  Wow, I am salivating just thinking about the flavor. So yeah, be prepared to pay more than one customarily would for pub grub.  What can I say--the ingredients and preparation are worth the price. My only criticism would be the acoustics, which give loud voices a few extra decibels after they've bounced off the ceiling.  Wear your earplugs, and a pair of comfortable pants."
Best burger I have had in all of my life. Three kinds of meat ground up. We added bacon and cheddar. Don't ruin it with any other condiments.  Our server recommended good beers too. Go there. You can park in the theatre for $2.
"My husbawalked I went here for date night. It was a Monday night at 7pm. The first good sign is that all the tables were full! Even with a short wait of 20 minutes, we decided to sit at the bar to eat.  My husband, who is Irish, and drinks a lot of beer was really, really excited about their selection and the beers offered on tap. I,  on the other hand, was perfectly happy with a delicious bottle of root beer.We had heard about their burger so we decided to share it. I would have ordered my own but was not that hungry. More on that in a second.... We ordered octopus to start and it was delicious! The bartender who too our drink and food order was super friendly and fun to chat with. Okay, back to the burger.....first of all, they make everything  fresh right there,including their own dill pickles! When the burger came, the bartender said, ""be prepared to never look at another burger the same again"". Boy, was he right! It was juicy, delicious and the aged cheese we added was salty, nutty and mouth watering! Literally my eyes were rolling back into my head! I will never be the same, it was that good. I am still dreaming about it today!The hand cut, fresh French fries served with it were sensational on their own but they served them with a malt vinegar aioli that was sooooo delicious.I highly recommend this place if you are a fan of finding the perfect cheeseburger. My search ended with Owen & Engine!!"
Tuesday burger and beer deal is a steal! Burger was awesome!
"Me and two friends stopped in here on a whim after our movie across the street. In that area you have Burger King or BBQ to choose from so it was a pleasant surprise. This place blew me away. First off, we were greeted politely, not once but by FIVE separate staff persons (no exaggeration)  all wanting to know if we'd been helped yet. A little over eager but it was a pleasant contrast to the usual unenthusiastic restaurant hosts at most places. Our waiter was THE best. So well informed on every single detail without ever crossing the line into gratuitous explanations. I got an education that night! We tried a little bit of everything. (I'm salivating just thinking about that beer menu.) Chicken wings were delectable. Cheese plate was gorgeous with such a nice variety of extras to slather atop of every piece you cut. And the squeak and bubble disappeared fast. My friend ordered a giant steak so well prepared we couldn't stop talking about it.Very unique place. After about 3-4 rounds of drinks and several plates of food the bill was around $175. Probably a once every two months place for the price. That's if I'm good. I could eat here every weekend and it will take some effort to restrain myself not to."
"Oh. My. God. Best burger I've ever had. Normally when a server describes something as ""too good to share"", I assume he's just blowing smoke up my ass. But this man was bearded and Welsh, so last night I decided to give it a chance. Boy am I glad I did!!! This thing was so amazing I wanted to bury my face in it and die there. I literally did not put it down until it was gone.Seriously go here. For a pub on the corner next to a funeral parlor, sketchy movie theater and greasy spoon BBQ pit (ugh Fat Willy's...also AMAZING), they actually care about their food. For example, they butcher and cure all their meat onsite (something my delightful waiter told me all employees are forced to partake in)....hell everything was just so damn tasty, just RUN RUN RUN down here as soon as you can.Also, you can partake at the aforementioned sketchy movie theater for a very reasonable $2 and the staff seems to have an excellent knowledge of the extensive beer selection. Cannot emphasize enough: go here, go here, go here."
"Came here for brunch this weekend.  No wait, cheap street parking, and cute ambiance.  The decor seems kinda authentic as an english pub.  And the food was really good.  The scones are crumbly and soft, and my coffee was french pressed and good, although the first cup was not hot.   My friend loved her tea, I guess they use some special brand there.  I got the scottish pancakes and they were exceptionally good.  My friends liked their food too, one had the quiche and the other had the beef hash with a fried duck egg.  It took over an hour to get our food, so it was definitely lukewarm, but it tasted good and we were hungry at that point.  I definitely would like to try this place for dinner."
"I debated but I'm going five star on this one, if only for their burger and beer selection. We came a  bit late and had to settle for their pub menu which actually worked out pretty well. We decided to share a bunch of things and wash them down with a few beers. The amish chicken wings were really tasty and the chive creme fraiche complemented them very well. Also good were the meat pies. I thought the pastry crust was nice and flaky. The star of the evening was the burger. Tasty, juicy, delicious. We added the cheddar which was a plus. The accompanying fries were also really good. I'd go back just for this. Our waiter was also good. Knowledgeable, friendly. My wife told him which beers she liked and he recommended a winner with the Weihenstephaner Hefe Weiss. I stayed with a two brothers domaine dupage. Their selection is awesome. Two things that almost brought it down a star:1. The pork rinds were stale and not good. 2. The bartenders gave me beard envy. I'll be back for their beers, burger, and to try the fish and chips."
"By far the best ""find"" in a long time.   Yeah, they are somewhat doing the ""freshly sourced"" hipster thing hitting the city, but they have an excellent bar, grub tilted toward that of a true London pub, excellent beers and can make a wicked classic ""handcrafted"" cocktail.   Try the Saczerac neat.   Plus, they've done an excellent job rehabbing this cute little building.   Parking is a problem, but you can always park in the homie theatre garage across the street.I liken O&E closest to the Gilt Bar on Kinzie/Franklin but a tad more on the comfort food side."
"This upscale English pub has been renovated beautifully. It's romantic and cozy with gold velvet flocked wallpaper and warm wood. Fittingly, the entire waitstaff looks like they just got off tour with their indie orchestral rock band. I visited O&E on Saturday night with a party of four. We were seated upstairs which, along with a few tables, had a small bar and comfy seating around a fireplace. I'm not sure if this is the standard but - attention single ladies - I'd advise you to head on up and grab a pint! The upstairs was filled with guys. I would say it was about a 15:2 guy to girl ratio. The menu of English standards is fairly small. I had the fish & chips, which was good if a little bland. My sister had the mussels with chorizo & potatoes that she found made the sauce a bit heavy for her taste but. still good. Our partners ordered the bangers & mash and the rasher & egg sandwich which they enjoyed without compliant save the cost. You won't be eating dinner here without dropping around 20-40 per person. However, the standout for us were the cheapest thing we ordered, fries with homemade mayo. Actually, the whole bar menu looked pretty appealing. Given that, and the high cost of dinner I imagine our next trip here will be for drinks and small plates only."
Cheeseburger.
"tuesday night date idea:1.  order 2 specials at owen and engine  -- a burger, beer, and a shot for $152.  go across the street to the movie theater for half off tickets on tuesdays. 3.  hold hands and giggle like teenagers.you're welcome!  that's what i'm here for!"
Their burger legit changed my life.  It was amazing!!
"I think this is a lovely addition to the area. I have only been twice for brunch but both times I was very happy with the food, and there was no wait even for prime brunch hours. Tasty eggs benedict, amazing house-made bacon, and the salt beef hash is super satisfying. Tried the crumpets and loved them! The only thing I had to compare them to are the ones that come in a plastic package in the grocery store which were gross! So in comparison, the crumpets at Owen and Engine were out of this world! The coffee service is gorgeous! Beautiful china tea cups, a little shortbread cookie, lumps of sugar, and the coffee comes in a french press. It is great coffee, however, it gets cold pretty quickly because of the glass caraffe on the french press. Also, you pay per caraffe, so no bottomless cup here. A solid brunch option with great food, but it can get a bit pricey. Two french presses of coffee, crumpets, two brunch entrees, one side of bacon added up to a $60 brunch for two. Woof. Worth the trip for the food, but be careful of all the little extras if you're trying to stay on budget. I wish I could give 3.5 stars, but I'll round up to 4 for the quality of the food."
"shut the front door! and get the brownie dessert! (it's salty, sweet, chewy, delicious, bomb dot com.)"
"I made all my friends come here and meet me for my birthday and it was awesome.  Great everything!  Our server Lauren was super.  And everyone was very welcoming.  I'm not waiting another year to go back. I'm going every Tuesday I can for their $15 Burger, beer and bourbon special.  It would be dumb not to.  Thanks Owen & Engine for always showing me a great time."
I'm just so impressed with the wall paper!
"Hmmm, strange... I came to rewrite my review of when Owen and Engine opened, but it has disappeared. It wasn't even a bad review-- what's going on Yelp? Purging reviews for no reason?At any rate, we gave this place another shot. It has been quite a while since we last ate here (we normally stop in for a drink while waiting for shows at the movie theater). Last time my biggest complaint was that the Fish and Chips were soggy even though it came right out of the kitchen (our table was right in front of the kitchen), but this time the Fish and Chips came out and were nice and crispy. It did get soggy after about 10 mins but I think it's because they put the sauce right on the fish as also put the fish on top of pea puree. Sure it looks pretty, but to preserve the integrity of the batter, I still recommend putting the sauce on the side. So all in all, I'm glad that my Fish and Chips were 110% better this time.My boyfriend tried their burger. It looked reasonably priced but after we added things like cheese and bacon, his burger was about $20. They charge a lot for toppings: $2 for cheese and $3 for bacon. Good thing it was DELICIOUS!We also tried the Clams. They were awesome. The combination was a little unusual compared to other preparations of clams that i have had. The clams were steamed with corn and bacon in a sweeter broth but it worked!If anything, this place has a kick ass selection of beers and they are for the most part reasonably priced."
"this place is kinda hidden across a local trashy movie theater in my neighborhood, but don't let that turn you off, it was delicious.we got the peanuts (w/sriracha, worcestershire, brown sugar) and pickle jar to start, then i got the slagel farm beef burger with caramelized onions and cheddar and chips (fries) with malt vinegar aioli. there were some rave reviews about this on previous reviews i read, and now i understand why. i bit into it, and my response wasgf got the scallops which aren't my thang, but she really enjoyed them...seared on the outside and nice and soft and chewy inside.we wanted bone marrow, but that's only in the wintertime i guess.i got a delicious, strong belgium beer, don't even recall the name, fumble peter.couple next to us got the fish & chips which looked delicious, might have to try that next time, because YES, there will be a next time."
Food is good. Servers are charming. Staff is accommodating. Take their suggestions on libations. You won't be sorry!
"First of all...best burger I've ever had. I had a bite of my date's burger and she ordered it plain. The fried egg, cheese, and bacon are unnecessary. Best charcuterie board I've ever had. The head cheese, rillettes with pork rind, pork pie, spicy chorizo, and sausage were all amazing. The bowl of olives featured a tasty assortment. I had the fish and chips and enjoyed it. We tried a few cocktails...of these my favorite was the O&E Pimm's cup. There were so many things on the menu I wanted to try that I can't wait to return...the blueberry pie sounded amazing, and i still regret not indulging."
"What did this place not have? Caipirinha's...and that should be expected from a Gastro British Pub. But, I tried to order it anyway in honor of Jolly Bob's in Madison, WI. Anyway, this place was pretty damn cool. My buddy knew one of the chefs, so he must have hooked up the sweet table upstairs in back because it was about as close to a private room as you can get. The food: I got the half chicken. I could have literally cut the breast easily with a dull butter knife. It was that moist and delicious. It had a dark sauce on the plate that complimented the chicken well. My girlfriend got the gnocchi and it didn't look great, but it was actually good. You know how you can add bacon to anything to make it better? Exactly. The service: Our waiter took his time getting us drinks, but honestly that worked only cause I was in the mood for a chill night. He blamed it on the bartender getting ""a lot of cocktail orders"", but please. Karma...Will I return? Most definitely. My cousin has been raving about this place for some time. I thought that maybe he was just talking up Logan Square, but he was for real on this place. Bravo."
"At first I thought, ""A British Pub with food? Gross.""  But I gave it a shot and really liked it.  The food, the atmosphere, the staff, this place is great.I loved the warm atmosphere.  It is a classy pub.  It has a look that makes it seem that the pub has been around forever, even though it hasn't.  It is inviting and cozy.The bartenders and watiresses are so friendly.  They offer helpful suggestions, and give speedy service.  The menu has enough variety for everyone to find something they will like.  I ordered the Sirloin Sandwich and it was delicious.  Crusty bread, sirloin, and a delicious sauce.  It also came with perfectly cooked fries.  They even had malt vinegar for the fries!I was very impressed by the extensive selection of beer and drinks.  It is a nice place for a date or drinks with friends."
"Being one of the only vegans in a circle of fellow food lovers can involve some research before dinner. Based on the menu, I didn't expect to eat at Owen & Engine, so I ate beforehand.I kind of wish I hadn't, because the server kindly talked with the chef about possible vegan options. They had a seasonal squash dish that they could make with olive oil in place of the butter. Other vegetable-based sides could be similarly adapted. Still no major entrees, but it would have been enough for a light dinner. I ended up getting the chips with regular malt vinegar in place of the aioli. They were alright, but I like the ones I make a little better.The cask ale - specifically the New Holland Night Tripper Imperial Stout I had - is awesome. I'd go here just for the beer.Our server was polite and helpful. The rest of the staff was not. It was the night of their staff party, and clearly they had lost interest in working. It took too long to get our food from the kitchen, though our server was quick. They should have not accepted reservations for that evening if they knew they wouldn't be able to handle patrons."
"Best fish and chips I've ever had. The fish was incredibly fresh, flaky and moist while the batter was flavorful and crisp. The chips were good, too, I think, but I was so distracted by the amazing fish that I really can't remember too well. The mix master is also extremely talented, making me an amazing hot toddy, then an excellently delicious drink dubbed the ""Whoville Warmer"" which was not on the menu, but exactly what my lingering cold needed.Get here early on the weekend if you want a good seat, or a seat at all for that matter. Upstairs by the fire is an excellent spot in Chicago's cold weather months, but again, get there early. Our server, I think his name was Mike (or maybe Matt?), was excellent. He steered us in the right direction in drinks, food and dessert, all while being incredibly entertaining. Highly recommend this top-of-the-line service. Great work with making service a priority, O & E. Next time we're in the area, or before a night out at Quenchers or the movies, I will make a beeline for Owen & Engine first."
"Can I eat here always?The cask beer was delicious. I had the Two Brother's Can and Ebel and it was the perfect beginning to a great meal. The food was incredible. A friend and I split the salad and the fish and chips. The salad had wonderful flavor and the parmesan cheese just elevated it that much higher. The fish and chips were delightful as well. The fish was lightly breaded and flaky with a homemade tartar sauce and a sauce of peas. The chips were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with a delicious malt vinegar mayo dipping sauce.We finished our meal with the Banobo dessert (they don't always serve it) which was a rich combo of bananas, butterscotch, and chocolate mousse. Nough' said.The service was so attentive, which I appreciated but  the attention was almost too much for me. The decor is rich and very cigar house style. I could have easily found a leather couch upstairs and stayed all night long!"
"If I brought the kid, the first part of the review always has to be about whether or not I felt the place was ""good for kids.""  I don't care what that little check mark in the Yelp description says; if I paid that any mind, the only places I'd ever eat would be John's and Uncle Julio's.As usual, when the restaurant isn't explicitly kid friendly, I stick to the general rules of arriving early or late, at an off time and being ready to leave in moment's notice if my baby goes from hyde to jekyll....I noticed another reviewer also stuck to these general rules when bringing his little one to O&E and didn't get a very good reception.I won't say you can't bring your kid here - They offered us a banquette seat as that's the best place to secure the carseat - especially if you're not offered a high chair flipped upside down (we weren't). I did notice that some of the Williamsburg-styled staff were suspicious of the evidence of sexual congress reclining at our table.  Did they just not like her Sex Pistols shirt? I can't be sure. They might simply have suffered from the common affliction known as coolitis, which is contracted from beer, cigarettes, tattoo ink and very tight trousers. Fortunately, it's not terminal; it just forces a sour look, which some could interpret as rude face.On the other hand, our waitier was fantastic.  Of course, this could have been because my partner is an actual English person, who was more than excited to appraise our Saturday brunch service on its authenticity.Overall, the meal was good. French press coffee,a beautiful pastry plate, bangers and mash and Eggs Benedict.  But I wouldn't order the Eggs Benedict again.  The bacon used (rashers, as pointed out by another reviewer) doesn't cut well and the crumpets just weren't right.  Crumpets require sponginess and these were just too solid.  Knowing the general competence and skill of the kitchen, I would expect there may be some experimenting that could be done to remedy this.  Crumpets should sponge butter - or hollandaise.  My partner very much enjoyed his housemade bangers; he cries over the lack of real sausage in Chicago.  The cheddar mash is lethally savory.  As a little bonus, our lovely waiter brought some homemade brown sauce (HP sauce) to try and we loved that as well.Sidenotes on the experience....O&E doesn't yet have the cozy feel of the quintessential English pub.  Maybe that just requires more time or dirt.  As O&E's lifecycle continues, I'd like to see it take on a warmer, more homey feel - maybe the coolitis in the air has has it too chilly to be the real thing on this side of the pond. For the true pub feel, there needs to be more of a sense that this is the place you can just walk in, pull up a chair, bring the fam or not, kick back and raise your glass."
It's like England without soccer hooligans and bad teeth.  Take the waiter's beer recommendations. Heads-up: steak sandwich is actually a roast beef sandwich. But it's delicious.
"Another stop on my friends and I's city burger tour.  To me, this one stood out.Again, I am a purist at heart, so if you can make me a good solid burger with a great meat to bun ratio and pairing without any razzle dazzle to it (im so tired of bacon and fried eggs being added to every burger) and it can stand on its own, you own me.  This place owns me.The beef patty is one of the best hamburger beef patties you can find.  The rough ground of short rib and brisket meat is so flavorful and tasty, and that texture of the rough ground is great.  All it has on it is sautéed onions and put on a very soft onion roll.  PURE in its truest form.No need for ketchup or veggies, just eat the burger the way it is.  Thats how its meant to be, and thats a true testament as to how good a burger is.  I am curious to try it with some cheese next time, but im also afraid to as well since I dont want it to overpower what else is going on here.The place itself is very cool and casual.  The prices are a bit on the higher side, but after you taste the burger, you realize you are paying for quality.  We also tried the bacon sandwich (decent, but wanted the thick cut bacon.  Good sourdough bread though) and had all three desserts.  The chocolate trifle was very rich and decadent, the apple was good if you ate it with the apple butter, and the sweet potato pie was ok but had a shining star in the marshmallow on top.  Not sure if i would order the desserts again, but happy to try em.  No matter what though, this place has got me by the ""fill in the blank here"" because of their burger.  Now if you want a burger with bacon, fried egg, and all sorts of stuff so that you dont taste the meat as much, this is not the place for you.  But if you want to eat a burger where you can truly appreciate the beef patty, this is the spot."
"I love the food and drinks here, but what really makes this place special to me is the wonderful service from the bar and waitstaff. Every waiter or waitress I've had here, including Ryan, Beth and Kitty, have been incredibly helpful, friendly, and professional. You can get great food in plenty of places in Chicago- but the staff here are the true gems, IMHO."
"The best burger hands down. Im constantly craving it. I love this place, everything about it, staff is super friendly and our waiter (i forget his name) was a total babe. The bathrooms have felt wall paper, its amazing."
"Came in with some high expectations and O&E didn't disappoint....until the food arrived.  The layout and style of the place is really cool - it's an experience to come here, and there's no place I've seen that quite matches what they've been able to do with the place.  It's very comfortable, cozy and intimate.  Like being in some English aristocrat's drawing room or something.  Great beer selection, excellent service, and the food was as unique as the decor and the ""costumes"" of the staff. Probably could've gotten 5 stars from me but some of the dishes were just plain too salty.  Didn't like the pickles much...pork rinds were interesting but not something I'd get again...the bone marrow didn't do anything for me but came with a good risotto.  Wasn't impressed either by the coddled egg, but everything up to that point was all in all OK.  The burger would've been fantastic had it not been totally oversalted, but the fries were fantastic.  I can't remember getting better fries anywhere else.  We also got the chicken, which was WAY too salty.  I could tell without the heavy dose of salt it would've been a really top notch dish."
"2.5 stars.  First time I came here was for a scheduled birthday party for none other than me!  We had the big table/room reserved and everything was great.  From the pasty to the duck entree to the excellent beer selection (German Rauchbier?  I'm impressed.)  Service was great too.  Fast forward, 8 months later, decided I was jonesing for a burger and wanted to try theirs.  Was seated in the bar area which is not as nice as the upstairs but I digress.  Beer selection is still stellar, but the service was a bit distant.  Ordered the burger, medium rare and it came out rare, which I didn't mind too much.  They tack on another $2 for added toppings which is a bit annoying given the burger already is $14.  Added cheese, can't remember which one, but the burger was very average on taste.  Given it's pedigree (local cattle, grass-fed, blah/blah), I was expecting greatness.  It  was very average.  The thin potato bun was a nice change of pace and did add some flavor and texture, but it did not elevate the burger that much.  And the fries were very average too, a bit overcooked.  Warm aioli saved them from oblivion but there wasn't enough flavor (more garlic was needed perhaps) in the aioli.  Left somewhat unsatisfied and overcharged for what is was worth.  If I hadn't ordered the burger, there wouldn't have been much to select from as their menu is a bit limited.  Amish chicken?  Yeah, everybody and their brother in Chicago is playing ""Rumspringa"" (google it, I know the Amish very well, perhaps too well) with chicken.  Fish & Chips?  I've had the real thing many times in England and the stuff they server in America is a pathetic joke.   Steak, are you serious?I may go back for the burger special on Tuesdays or when they have the duck back on the menu, but until then, I'm content to go to Revolution or the Peasantry when I'm in the mood for the gastropub."
"Finding the latest gastropub has become pretty easy these days. Look for an ampersand in the name and it's a near guarantee that the wait staff will be clad in flannel, the provenance of your food will be prominently placed on the menu, and the only beer pouring will be thoughtfully curated craft - my ideal imbibing and dining destination. Owen & Engine in Logan Square asserts itself among the leaders in the current wave of ampersand laden establishments sprouting up in Chicago.While waiting for our table (no reservations), we passed the time at the bar where certified Cicerone Elliot Beire expertly, yet very approachably, walked us through what was pouring on the four - yes four - beer engines. Even in Chicago's most prominent beer bars, cask ale is a novelty; here they are passionate about it. As a matter of principle, I always get my first pint from the hand pull to support a pub's commitment to real ale. Shortly into our second pint we were seated upstairs where the dark wood and damask wallpaper contributes to the ambiance and exudes coziness.Our dinner entrees included the astonishingly light and greaseless batter-fried haddock flown in fresh daily from the North Atlantic and the Slagel Farm's burger served with caramelized onions on a potato bun. The burger here is delivered without traditional accoutrements as to not distract from the custom blend of brisket, chuck, and short rib, which results in one of the ""beefiest,"" umami laden, burgers I have ever had the pleasure of tasting. Admittedly a bit out of the way and on an odd corner, Owen & Engine elevates humble pub food without being a scenester's paradise, making the journey well worth it."
"The wife and I had dinner here before seeing a show across the street (great location location to eat and drink before a movie, although the beer selection may cause you to miss some of your show) and we both came away pretty impressed. We had a reservation for 7:30 which was honored even though we were ten minutes late and people were waiting for tables (apologies all around).I had a couple of Mud Puppy stouts to wash down my fish and chips; both were excellent. My better half had the burger with just caramelized onions which she thought was delicious (I can confirm). I think I could happily alternate between the burger and fish 'n chips every time I come here, but there are some other items that look good as well. The only complaint my wife had, besides what I thought was curry ketchup for the chips and was kinda good, was her pour of wine seemed a bit light. I thought it was close enough not to complain, although for $9 a glass (of what is probably a $12 bottle) it could have been more generous. Since everything else was spot on, I'll give Owen and his Engine the benefit of doubt (maybe the end of the bottle?).We were seated upstairs and thought the ambiance was very cozy-almost like being in an English pub, but the tasty food happily ruined the authenticity (and I didn't see bottles of that dreadful HP sauce).  Our server was also very good and his recommendations were great (although that's easy when the stuff is good). Overall very good. We live in the 'hood and plan to be back."
"Very cool décor... heavy dark wood paneling, fabric-like wallpaper, an upstairs that is fun for a group and is romantic and intimate for a date!  We were heading to a movie, so we had to eat quickly... things are a bit expensive... my friends got the charcuterie plate and it looked underwhelming for $15.  I got spiced almonds as my little snack ($4) and they were excellent, both in taste and in quantity!  The server was SO knowledgeable.  Very cool place.  Huge extensive beer/drinks/wine menu, much more vast than the food menu.  I was glad to try it out, and I will be back!"
"I love the atmosphere in here.  The traditional wallpaper, fireplace, old school leather chairs and sofas.  It somehow captures ""relaxed"" and ""formal"" in the same instance.  We went here on a Sunday night whim just to get out of the house.  The staff was very friendly, chatty and accommodating; and there was a group of rowdy middle-aged men sitting around the fire shooting the shiz, and giving the bartender a good-natured hard time.  LOL.They offer several cask beers every night along with draughts and cans.  If you haven't tried a cask beer, I suggest you give it a try, a little less carbonation, warmer, and has a nice ""creaminess"" to it.  I only had two beers, but it made me a bit tipsy.  The beer has a high alc % here, so be careful!We chose the appetizer of pickled vegetables to share.  Each veggie was pickled in its own unique vinegar/herb mixture that made each ""pickle"" unique.  For the entree, I had the fish and chips.  It was delicious, served with tartar sauce.  Although it was weird it wasn't served with the traditional Malt vinegar--I probably should have just asked for some.I like that it's right across from the movie theater, making it a perfect spot for brunch/matinee or dinner/movie combo.  We'll be back!"
"This place is modeled after a British gastropub, but unlike in Britain where everyone is just drinking and I was the lone person in the entire bar eating, everyone in Owen & Engine is eating.  And with good reason.  Their versions of British fare are actually really tasty.  I love that they have the ""British"" names on the menu like bangers and mash and bubbles and squeak.  We started our meal with the pickles.  One guy in our party ate a really hot jalepeno and needed bread.  So we asked for bread, which was off menu.  They ended up charging up $3 for it, but it was some of the best bread I've had.  They had fresh out of the oven baguette, brown rolls, and some other stuff I can't remember.  Then we had the burger and the fish and chips.  Fish and chips were well fried and the fish was perfectly flaky.  The burger was the star.  Ground in house, so not ground as fine as what you'd get in the supermarket.  I recommend getting the onions on the side, so you can really taste the beef.  For dessert we had sticky toffee pudding, which was a cake baked in a ramekin served with a toffee flavored syrup.  I've never had it before, so I wasn't sure what to expect.  The cake was a little bland, so a lot of syrup is a must.  Syrup was very tasty, but not as sticky as I expected.  The waiter warned us to spread out the syrup for the entire cake, and as he predicted, we ran out before we were done with the cake.  Still it was a pretty good dessert.  All in all, experience was positive.  This place is quite expensive for pub food though, but you are getting unique foods.  Ask for a table upstairs, it's cozier and has a fire."
"A-ma-zing! First time I've ever had a Scottish Egg.. delish! The meatballs were a little too small but ohhhhhh so tasty! Also, I'm from the south soooo I know 'Fish 'n Chips' and theirs is incredible! The malt vinegar aioli was perfect with the dish! Great service, great experience!"
"This is easily the best British Pub I've been to in a while.  The decor is charming and tasteful, exactly the way an upscale pub is supposed to look.  The beer is unbelievable.  They have three rotating casks, served at the proper temperature (read:  warm) and the pints are imperial (read:  big).  I've had three different beers from their casks and they were all fresh and delicious.  A proper cask pour is reason enough to visit this place.The food is all high quality.  I have to say that British food has a well deserved reputation for being bland so Owen and Engine is playing with an arm tied behind their back.  However, their focus on locally sourced, fresh ingredients makes the best of it.  The fried halibut strips (in the fish and chips) were moist and the breading delicate and their fries are excellent (served with vinegar aioli).  However I thought the bubble and squeak was pretty bland (it's essentially mashed potatoes, but not creamy or garlicky) and the corned beef hash was dry and had too many potatoes.  My first trip I got the burger and it was outstanding, definitely the best I've had in recent memory.  They talk up how it's made from Slagel farm beef and ground from a blend of cuts.  The result was a tender and very beefy burger that tastes good all by itself (no fancy toppings necessary).  However, my second trip they WAY overcooked it, essentially ruining the meal since it was such a huge letdown.  The service was nice about it, comped us a dessert, but such an error coupled with some of the bland dishes make this a good but not great destination for me.Still, British pub food done very well."
"A friend & I had dinner at Owen & Engine last week before a movie.I was the only one drinking & was excited by the beer list. They have 20-30 beers on tap, including at least 4 cask conditioned ales. I didn't completely review the list of beer available by the bottle because there were so many great options on tap. The waitress was very knowledgeable, listened to what I liked/didn't like, made some great suggestions and was generous with the samples.We got:* Homemade pickles: Good assortment of young carrots, brussels sprouts, beets, bread & butter pickles and red onions. Nice assortment of items, all of which still had a nice crunch to them.* Charcuterie platter: Pork rillettes, a salmon terrine, Tuscan salami, a domestic prosciutto (from PA or NY, I think) and another sausage along with some homemade crackers, bread, mustard, and more bread & butter pickles and pickled red onions.* Scallops: So great we ordered a second round. Served with a fresh minted pea puree, crispy prosciutto and roast or sauteed green onions. Fantastic combo of savory, sweet and salty fresh flavors.* Streaky bacon: A good-sized chunk of bacon ends (pork belly?), nice & crispy on the outside with melt-in-your mouth texture inside, wilted greens & peach slices, which made a terrific combo."
"Was dismayed when the hostess told me ""good luck"" when told her I was going to drink at the bar.  We went upstairs from the 3-deep crowd to a 2-deep crowd at the bar.  Before I even had a chance to get upset at this, the bartender spotted us empty-handed in the scrum and passed back drink menus.  This was full of win.  The quick service, awesome cocktails and fantastic decor more than made up for the fact we had to stand in a crowd.  Grabbed stools about 15 minutes later, and quickly got nice and lit trying out a wide sampling of mixes, including being the benefactors of an old-fashioned-making contest between the two barmen, who were friendly and attentive the whole time we stayed, despite the crowd .  A great time, look forward to returning to try the food that smelled so good."
"What a delightful public house!  Drinks and food are brilliant and reasonably priced.  The furnishings and wood panel walls make we want to live there.  My girlfriend wants me to say that they don't have vegetarian options and she thinks they dislike Scotland, but I don't know what she's on about.  This pub is my new favourite."
"Owen & Engine was really great, even though it's in Randomtown, U.S.A. Great pubish atmosphere with a view of... the behemoth cineplex on Western. But you don't go to a restaurant for the views...So:I had a Druid to drink-- tasty, but was served in a martini glass and looked like something out of an old episode of Sex & the City. Drink two was a delicious beer aged in a whiskey barrel (I forget the name). For food we got the Gnocchi with goat cheese, snap peas, hen of the woods mushrooms, and pancetta-- it was everything I expected it to be for having all of my favorite ingredients (mm). For my main course I got the Fish & Chips which was really, really good. So buttery, flakey and delicious and the sauce for the chips was totally addictive. I tried my friend's burger as well, which was excellent/incredibly flavorful.Definitely check this place out. We enjoyed it and left really full."
"Very clean, very welcoming, and a cute place to take a date out for brunch.  Their beer selection is pretty great and although i was a wee bit disappointed that they ran out of the beer I wanted, they did give me what was left of it, which was about half a glass for free!  Freebies are always welcomed.Their Bangers and Mash were just as good as everyone says it is.  Unfortunately, they do not server Fish & Chips for brunch so I was saddened that I couldn't try the staple of what all English pubs are known for and seeing that their other dishes were pretty tasty, I'm sure I'll head back one day in the evening to give it a try. Parking is a bit of a hassle, but you can occasionally find spots a block away. Anyway, if you're not going there for beer, I do warn you that their food tends to be on the salty side to compliment the beers, so be warned."
"You know what?  It was just OK.  I found the beer selection decent, but heavier on the American crafts (ehh-hem, did somebody say IPA overload?) than on the Europeans - namely, the British!  I did find the beer prices far from competitive. Charging $30 for a 22oz (NOT a 750ml!) Goose Island specialty brew is just beyond reason, no matter how you slice it. Yes, the fish and chips were well prepared, though I wasn't wowed. The haddock itself had an odd texture from what I am accustomed to and the batter was a bit on the salty side. Perhaps my expectations had just been built too high from reading the rave reviews.  The bangers were excellent quality but just didn't have that quintessential banger ""taste,"" and the mash and gravy were lackluster. They also came out to the table lukewarm and by the time I found our server to address the matter (he took the plate back to the kitchen to be reheated, not remade) my husband had finished his meal. It's never pleasant to go out for a nice dinner only to wind up eating alone because the other guests at your table are through with their meal by the time yours arrives. No real apology or compensation was offered. There are a number of quintessential British favorites that never made it to the menu, but should have.  A nice Sunday roast, steak and kidney or pork pie, a ""curry,"" cullen skink, scotch egg, all-day breakfast and a rhubarb crumble, all would have made perfect sense to offer - and would have set O&E apart as a true purveyor of British cuisine. Our server seemed like a nice guy, if a bit dispassionate and overtaxed - and he was MIA for a good portion of the evening. The place did boast a warm and pleasant atmosphere, but overall, I would not go out of my way to come here again.  Far and away my favorite gastropub in the Chicago area is still Publican.  There is just no contest."
"A friend and I hit up Owen and Engine on a rainy Saturday night. As others have remarked, the ambience is very cool - - homey, woody, totally London-esque, (having never been to London I'm confident of this assessment, mmmhmm).Staff were super friendly.Grub: We ordered the burger, the fish and chips, and the amish chicken wings with some beers. Dessert was Rhubarb crisp.Wings: Nicely savory, mild spice, slightly oily. Coulda used some extra grill time. As a testament to that, some of our wings appeared undercooked, but they did kindly replace our dish.Burger + fries: Savory, beefy, quite delicious. Fries were awesome with the aioli.Fish and Chips: I only tried a bite, but as others have noted, it seemed awfully slimy beneath the batter. My dining partner quite enjoyed her dish though. Rhubarb crisp: Very gingery and soupy. Meh. Overall: A cool atmosphere, would definitely get the burger again, but the quest for awesome fish and chips continues."
Great vibe. Great beer selection. Great food. Get the Scotch Egg and the risotto is a must-have.
"Best burger in the city hands down. O&E's burger is the bare minimum of what a burger should be, they've got it down to perfection. Everything I've ever had here has been exeptional, but I go for the beer, burger, bourbon tuesdays. They originated the BBB tuesdays, so don't take any imitations. Beer selection is top-notch as well, and the service is usually really good. It's a really cozy environment, perfect for eating before or after a movie on a rainy night."
"Owen & Engine has the best Fish & Chips I have ever had, hands down. The Haddock was light an flaky and the sauce gribiche was amazing. The house made aioli and house cut chips were the perfect pair. We also got the seasonal veg, which this time was beets and brussel sprouts with some amazing bacon. My wife ordered the Bangers and Mash, again the best we have had. The sausage had a lot of herb to it, but really pleasant and not over done. The mash has a ton of aged cheddar in it and it is as smooth as silk. Very filling and I can't wait to fry up the left overs at home. Make sure you check out the upstairs, fireplace, leather sofa, tables and a second bar. This place makes you forget that you are on Western. The staff was very knowledgeable and the Sous Chef came out a number of time to check on how things were (we were there on a Sunday evening). The experience of the kitchen really show through! We can't wait until the temperature drops because this place will be perfect to get the chill out."
"$15 for a 20-oz. beer, a 2-oz. ""shot"" of bourbon and a 10-oz. burger and fries that is definitely one of the ten best I've had in Chicago?  Off the top of my head, I can't think of a better deal (Tuesdays only); it was so much food and drink for a meal that my wife said she could have done without the beer and just had the bourbon and the burger...or, maybe that was me.  The burger is truly no-frills--I loves me some Lockdown, but the O&E burger is basically a cheeseburger with caramelized onions; I'm sure this was a mix of more than just ground beef, but I don't want to know the specifics, I just know it was amazing.  The fries and the aioli served with them were perfect.  The beer was actually too much for me, and the Zachariah Harris bourbon served was smooth as silk.  I'm in a tough spot; I already like to do Cortland's on Mondays for their $5 burger special, but the $15 special at O&E is something else...sounds like burgers two days a week will become the norm!!"
HOLY FUCKING DRINKS! AMAZING BEER SELECTION! AND THE BARTENDER ELIOT! THIS FUCKING GUYS WILL MAKE ANY DRINK YOU CAN THINK OF! AND BETTER THEN YOUR FAV BARTENDER!  Thinking of a Beer that you had in Kenya That was Made by a Chinese jewish guy that only kicks with his left leg?? I bet you a 100 bucks this Fucking uys knows about the beer and will Educate the shit out of you about that one beer.. Will also give you a shit load of sample beers till he figures out what type of beer is good for you!.. Oh.. and the FOOD! is GREAT.. wings are awesome.. burgers as well.. Stop reading this shit and go get drink already.
Pasty was amazing and the chips w curry sauce were great :-)
"I cannot say enough great things about the Owen & Engine, but I'll have a go...Atmosphere: It feels like a real British pub. Drinks: They have numerous cask conditioned ales that are excellently kept.  I went there this week with my wife.  We had an Old Speckled Hen, a beer that used to be brewed in my hometown (before Greene King bought it out) and a German amber ale that was rather refreshing.  On a previous visit, I had a fantastic Scottish beer that was brewed by Belhaven.Service: The waiters here are fantastic. Very attentive, friendly, and willing to chat and answer questions if you would like to talk or ask questions.  And they keep your water refilled so that you can stay hydrated enough to keep drinking beer.Food: The best part about this pub, in my opinion.  The fish and chips here are pretty much perfect -- the batter is light and not greasy, the tartare sauce is tantalisingly tasty, and the mushy peas are delicious (even if not truly ""mushy"").  The burgers are also excellent, and you can add rashers of English-style bacon to them -- bacon which the Owen & Engine cure themselves.  The only other item that I have tried is the bangers and mash -- also staggeringly good.Reservations: Make sure you have one unless you like to wait over thirty minutes.Location: Perhaps the worst part?  A little out of the way...  but as I might have said, I cannot recommend this place highly enough. A real gem."
"Decent food with a good beer selection, but the prices are completely out of touch. I stopped in on their openeing night, as I was excited about a gastropub in my neighborhood, and  was completely taken back at the prices when I saw the menu. Sandwiches start at $14, fish and chips are $15, and anything above that is going to run in the $25-$30 range.My date and I both decided to try the fish and chips, as we saw a pic of it online that looked pretty tasty. The fish was good, but by no means the best I've ever had. I would say it is on par with most $7-$10 fish and chip platters that you can find at any number of pubs around Chicago..and the fries weren't that good at all, we both only nibbled at them. Altogether, our tab for 2 fish and chips and 3 pints of beer was $49 (before tip)Bottom line, the concept here is a good idea, and fairly well executed, but the pricepoint is about 30- 40% off base. Honestly,  I could see myself stopping by again for a beer, but never again for dinner...for those prices, you can enjoy true fine dining instead of above average bar food."
"Outside of that whole ""no electricity"" thing, the Amish got one thing right--the Amish chicken wings at Owen & Engine. Despite the unnatural orange oil ring that will appear around your mouth as you eat, these suckers are top notch! Another can't miss starter on this menu are the house-made pickles. Each time we've gone, there has been a different assortment in the jar--from mushrooms and beats to radishes and brussel sprouts--it's like Christmas day for lovers of pickled things. Pickles aside (tee-hee), alcohol is always a highlight of any meal for me. The cocktails on the menu are pretty solid--they regularly change up the menu, but it's a safe bet to try their seasonal old fashioned or Manhattan if you're a bourbon/whiskey lover. For you beer lovers (the real kind... not the ones that ""opt"" for Dos Equis instead of Miller), give their cask beers a try. They're less fizzy and served at room temperature, but the flavors are great!Quick note on food: Lenten followers will find a high-quality Fish and Chips and burger/sandwich lovers would be remiss not to go for the burger or the sirloin sandwich."
"All i've been hearing is ""the burger from Owen & Engine is amazing, you gotta try it."" It's not far from me so i finally go. I can't give this place 1 star, cause i didn't necessarily try the food or the burger in particular, and the draft beer list was pretty good. I was hoping to get food there, but I basically sat down, ordered a beer, and was never able to get the bartender (and i assume manager due to what he was talking about) cause he refused to come to my end of the bar while he was just going on and on about the details of craft brewing and how he wants it served at O&E. Now i love me some craft beers, but there's nothing more annoying than some beer nerd going deep into the details of brewing. On top of that, i never got the chance to order that damn burger. That goes to show you how one bad, initial experience with one sub-par employee can ruin it for you from here on out."
"Ummmm . . . yes, please?Can I have more of everything? More hand crafted hand contitioned beer? More Whiskey with eye-droppers to add water at the amount want? More high end meat and potatoes?Everything in this place is fantastic. Did I mention leather armchairs in front of a fireplace with a flat screen? Great service?Worth every peny."
"Positives: I've visited Owen & Engine since it first opened and was immediately a huge fan for several reasons: the staff was friendly, well-educated on their offerings; the atmosphere is rich and intimate and the beer and cocktail selection is incredible!  The food is on the pricier side, but I forgive this because they use the highest quality meat and locally produced/farmed ingredients.  The food is great- try the burger, the fish & chips and the lamp chops if they ever have these as a special! Although the extensive beer list and cask ales take center stage (the Stone Smoked Porter is my current favorite), Owen & Engine gives Violet Hour some much needed competition in the hand-crafted cocktail department.Negatives: Since my first few visits, I've noticed that service has dropped down a few notches and O&E feels less openly inviting and more aloof and inattentive. Without getting into specifics- I understand everyone has an 'off' day- it seems that the staff is more interested in talking with each other than they are in paying attention to the patrons. I really hope the friendly, inviting feeling comes back to O&E. Kudos to O&E for becoming popular and doing well; I hope it sticks around for a long time, but as my momma says, ""Don't get too big for your britches."""
"Good drinks, good food."
"Excellent fish and chips, very crispy on the outside but was, as if steamed on the inside. Felt like they used different cooking methods before combining them on the plate for you! The Amish chicken was a tad too dry though and not flavored/marinated long enough.We also ordered chicken wings that were pretty good and tasty. My friend had oysters and was raving about it. They got our orders mixed up and our food arrived really late but they made it up with free yummy desserts. We got 1 each - the rhubarb crisp (oat streusel, ginger creme anglaise, candied orange), the choc financier (salted caramel sauce, almond kulfi, cocoa nib tuile), and the panna cotta (strawberry gelee, lime curd, lemon shortbread cookies). I personally didn't take to the rhubard crisp too well but my brother and sister in law were extremely happy with it. My fav is still chocolate! :)IMHO, It's an unforgettable place because of the awesome fish and chips."
"Awesome ambiance, extremely knowledgeable waitress, great alcohol list. All food was excellent however I wish there were one or two more veggie friendly options. My husband is British and he approves! We were there for four hours! Great place."
DELICIOUS! I have been twice and both times were absolutely tasty. The menu is not huge but everything is super savory and you will be satisfied. It's never a hassle to get a table like Longman and Eagle and is a much more civilized experience. I recommend it. Ps. I am addicted to the rasher sandwich.
"If I had to pick one thing not to like about Owen & Engine it would have to be its location. For the car challenged it is not an ideal location. Sure it's right along the Western bus line, but darn, it's tough to get to...BUT this is not something that can be changed and everything, I mean everything aside from that is pretty fantastic.Super friendly host, bartenders and servers? Absolutely. They were all happy to discuss the menu, gave samples of beers and overall were a pleasure to be around. The menu is delicious and is stocked with traditional British food fare. Their scones were melt in your mouth delicious!"
"This is my go-to spot when I need a quick bit to eat or a couple drinks. It is certainly helped by the fact it is literally two blocks from my apartment. I've never had a bad meal here - the food is simple and straightforward, but can be very creative. A ton of well-deserved accolades have been heaped on their burger, which truly is one of the best burgers I've ever eaten. But, sometime I have stuff to do after my meal, and that burger and fries usually puts me out for the count. They have some great small plates as well. I LOVE the duck meatballs, which consist basically of a duck/pork meatball in a curry sauce with saag paneer. It is a delicious combo and makes for an affordable meal if you aren't terribly hungry. They also have amazing peanuts, which are coated in a worcestershire/sambal/brown sugar/secret spice coating and make for a great bar snack. Everyone who works is very friendly and the ambiance is so tasteful and upscale. It feels like what I assume a small irish bed and breakfast would feel like, though I have never been to a B&B OR Ireland...so take that last statement for what you will."
"I love Owen & Engine.  From the food, to the drinks, to the ambience- everything is fantastic.It is a old fashion styled English Pub.  The inside is beautifully designed with small little accents all over.  You can tell that someone put a lot of time into arranging this place.  It is very personal. The food is stellar.  I have mostly had the burger and the fish and chips.  I love them so much I don't really want to stray!  The burger is ground in house and served with onions and chips(fries) and cheese is optional for an extra 2 bucks.  Get the cheese.  Also order it rare because the meat is really good quality and has an amazing flavor.  Fish and chips are light and juicy.  The fish is served over a pea puree with tartar sauce and chips.  They also make their own ketchup- it has a sweeter taste to it, but it is very good.They have great beer and drink menu.  The drinks are typical mixology style (which I love), and the beer menu is really well thought out.  They have some standards like Orval and some Unibroue, but they also have some really great beers that I have never heard of.  Mostly belgian styles.  Also on draft they have these ""flat"" beers.  They are beers that don't have carbonation.  They may seem weird at first, but it really allows the elements of the beer to be more pronounced.  It is like drinking wine warm- you can taste more of the flavors. Try a glass!The service is great.  Really friendly people and very knowledgeable.  The only thing that is one minor downside is that they seem to have a little problem handeling busy nights.  The food and the service is always much better on a week night.  I think they just need to work out some more kinks in service when it gets busy."
"I really hate that I love this place. Seriously. Not only do I hate it, but my wallet hates the fact that I'm making it cheat on Irazu. I've been here a few times now, and it's been nothing but lovely experiences. The wait staff is great and extremely knowledgeable about all the beer/food here.Each time I've come, I've ordered the fish and chips....words cannot describe. The chips are pretty decent but the fish just seems to melt in my mouth and is coated in the perfect amount of lightly battered fried goodness. I've ordered the apple cobbler each time I've come and it's been nothing but amazing and the perfect cold weather desert. Bangers and mash were great, though the mash was a bit tastier than the bangers. The lamb was delicious and I am dying to try the rib-eye. At $39 though, I'm hoping I can find someone to split it with me...I've heard it's a bit large...I would hope so for the price tag. The veggies are crispy and perfect. They put such care in their food and though I complain about the price, it is very worth it. I hear they buy local and it makes me feel better when I sit my growing behind inside their dining room.The atmosphere....just amazing. Fire place, great warm feeling....I realllllly love this place. Though my wallet hates me each time I come (a meal for two with drinks is easily over $100)....my taste buds love this place. They have Best Brown on tap!5 min from my house....yes, I am recommending this place to everyone I know...I mean, come on...it's a win win for me. Great food. Great atmosphere. Great for my laziness...since I don't have to travel far. Now...I just need to find a sugar daddy/mama to take me out here more. People with cars only need apply."
"OMG, the chicken wings.I can end the review right there. Yes, the space and vibe is cool. Yes, the waiters take their job seriously and will help you with questions on both drinks and food. The beer menu is eclectic and well put together. They have awesome drinks specials. They take where their food comes from seriously and give things a creative spin. I'll be honest, I didn't think the fish and chips were unbelievable like so many others. But I was probably distracted still by  the extreme amazingness of their chicken wings!Seriously, just go for the wings and it's worth it."
"I would say this is really more of a 4.5 star restaurant. Despite the fact that the neighborhood is slightly odd (the corny looking movie theater across the street isn't the best dinner scenery) this was one of the best meals I've had in a long time.First of all, our server Ryan was the best waiter I have ever had anywhere. He knew everything about everything (beer, cheese, charcuterie, entrees). I kept asking questions because it was really nice to have someone give an intelligent, accurate response. After hearing his description of the charcuterie plate, we started with that. I can't remember all of the selections but the lamb bacon was tasty. I took Ryan's dinner recommendation and went with the pan roasted chicken, which was very flavorful and a good size portion. My husband went with the fish and chips which he thought was wonderful. Their malt vinegar aioli was terrific for the fries. His only complaint was $17 for fish and chips might be a little high. We also enjoyed their nightly $3 beer and $5 cocktail specials. For dessert, we tried the blueberry pie, which was amazing and different. They put caramel corn on top like a streusel and there is a little cheese baked in the crust. It was a great ending to a great meal.I will be going back since there are several items I was debating about trying. As with almost every place, I guess I wish the prices were a tiny bit lower but it was very high quality food and a wonderful experience."
"I scratched my brunch itch with their eggs Benny and was happy I made the right choice. Overall a well-done dish, with hollandaise that was thick but not goopified and some bacon snuck in. What set it apart of all things was the crunchy muffins that anchored this bad boy.... super tasty. A respectable bar and beer menu rounds out the fun. Unfortunately I tried a gin concoction called Lucky Lucy, which tasted nearly as girly as it sounded. Great bite and bitterness with a fresh, sweet lemon, but too sweet with honey, cinnamon, and maybe vanilla. Service on our midday stop was friendly and helpful, but the kitchen was killing our waitress in getting our order out. Fortunately it was worth the wait."
"**************************YUMMY*******************­*********Went here by accident when we were early for a movie the other night then returned for more a few days later. Decor and staff border on ""steampunk"" --totally Chicago. My drinks were A+ each time made with care by the super friendly bartender(s). The food is pig/beef/British and SO SO good. Can't wait to go here for brunch. Too bad it is located next to an ugly movie theater and creepy funeral home on a miniature highway (Western) across from a Target. Inside you can live the fantasy."
"This place is great! The ambiance is very cool with its dark woods throughout and it's industrial era feel. It looks like an upscale British pub.The service was great. The wait staff was not only friendly, but nice and very accommodating. When we asked to switch two things for another on one of the brunch menu items, there was no problem at all! And there is plenty of seating (there's more in their upstairs area) and there's two bars (one for each floor) which is nice.The food is fantastic. My friend, sister, and I shared three plates: (1) Full ENGLISH FRY UP, which included 'Tinned Beans', Fried Egg, Grilled Tomato, House Bacon, Brown Bread, Blood Sausage, & Banger. The Tinned Beans were delicious in their rich red sauce. The bacon was cooked to perfection. The brown bread was so good and buttery. And the eggs were divine. We didn't get the sausage and banger; (2) The Nichols Farm and Genesis Growers Seasonal Veg QUICHE. The quiche was cooked to perfection w/ the right amount of vegetables. The eggs were fluffy and the crust had a great thickness and texture to it; (3) Assortment of Miniature SCONES, Clotted Cream, House Jam. These scones were out of this world! Our assortment included raspberry, earl grey, and chocolate chip. They were warm and decadent. The texture was divine. These, unlike most scones, were moist and rich, not dry. They were served with soft butter and a tasty jam.Overall, I had a great dining experience here and I plan to go back!"
This place is awesome.  Brunch is delicious. The people here know and care about food.  Hand ground grass fed beef burger will not disappoint.  Add a fried egg for extra deliciousness.  Outdoor patio coming soon.
"Great beer selection.    Fish&chips amongst the best I've had! :)   Reservations a good idea even on a weeknight.    Tuesday special:    Burger, beer and a shot for $15!"
"Awesome! That is all you need to say. Best Fish and Chips ever, even better than in the UK.  Had the bone marrow and escargots, and I was in heaven.  This is a serious foodie pub, great vide, great service. Ask for Lauren, she is wonderful."
"Best fish and chips in the city! Apparently they make an airport run every morning for fresh haddock. The haddock on your plate tonight was alive yesterday!  They have a very limited number of orders so put your request in as soon as you sit down.  For cocktails try the Flipped Monk, made with egg whites and Chartreuse, it was awesome.Also the breakfast stout was a really nice beer,"
"This place ostensibly specializes in British food, but British food wishes it was this good. The prices are a little high, but you definitely get what you pay for. Their burgers--made of three different kinds of beef, if I remember correctly--are exceptional, possibly the best I've ever had in Chicago. Also: great beer and whiskey selections!"
"This place has become a favorite.  The food, service, beer/cocktail selection and large 2-level interior really set it apart from the rest of the city's gastropubs (Longman & Eagle is also great, however). I've been many times since its opening, and have never had a bad experience.Went for the first time for a quick visit very shortly after they opened.  We sat at the bar and were immediately impressed with the deliciously crafted cocktails, friendly bartender, and bar food menu (very small at the time).  My birthday was around the corner and we asked about reservations.  It ended up being a perfect place for a memorable birthday dinner. Thy have a semi-private back room upstairs (behind the bar) that has a large table perfect for a bigger group.  They were amazingly accommodating for our party of 12, even down to letting us play our own music with a separate iPod connection.  The food delivery was well paced and all delicious.  Food:-  The pot of house made pickles is a favorite and a must order.  It includes seasonal pickled veggies as well as pickles (the mushrooms are addictive).  -  The burger (made of house ground slagel farms beef) is amazing.  Everyone I know loves this burger.  Seriously - get it. -  Fish and Chips are really authentic and perfectly crispy.-   Bubble and Squeak side sounds sort of bland  - a bowl of mashed potatoes and grilled veggies mixed together - but is comforting and so good.-  The dinner was topped off with a (surprise) 6 layer red velvet cake with cream cheese icing. I don't think it's on the menu, but you can arrange with the pastry chef.  It was beautiful AND SO DELICIOUS.  We were eating it for days after.  I wish I could have some now."
"It takes a very bad experience for me to write a negative review of a restaurant on Yelp.  But I felt I had to warn other people about several problems in both service and operations of this establishment.  They ""run out"" of their signature dish, then they are snide and smarmy about it to your faces.  They hide behind the idea of freshness. However almost no other restaurant that orders things same day fresh that I have been to has ever been as rude or non-communicative as this one.  Stay away from this place.   After hearing about O&E from other Chicago foodies my girlfriend and I brought several of our friends here.  When we arrived they had open tables upstairs in the outside patio area but told us they were reserved and the wait would be about an hour.  We told them we had heard about the playful but mysterious little fish and chips dish and would have a drink or two at the bar.  It took about 40 minutes of listening to hipster Phil Collins and Huey Lewis remakes to get seated whereupon we asked if we could get three ""fish and chips"" which is, after all, the only excuse one could have for being in this restaurant. She told us they were out and when we expressed shock and exasperation she shrugged her shoulders and gave us a sorry your too late. I jokingly said I am a child of divorce gimmie a break!   But she maintained that it was our fault for them running out.  We spoke to a manager who was more of the same. I felt like my mask of sanity was about to slip. Perhaps their behavior can be a bit erratic sometimes, but we didn't get a positive experience.  So we left to go return video tapes.If they were Kuma's or Dorsia busy I might understand but they weren't.  Every place I have been to that orders fresh or runs out of things WARNS the customers ahead of time or posts some sort of signage showing they are out of something.  This place needs to learn a good lesson and teach the staff to be more understanding and accommodating, practice basic operations and order in sufficient quantity for a normal weekend, and communicate to customers facing 1 hour + wait times that they are running low."
"Food is amazing, well worth the wait. The female host that works on Sundays (when I usually go), is without a doubt the friendliest and most patient person in the world. Go here."
"OK, seriously, in the realm of Gastropubs that don't make their own beer, this place is the GOLD STANDARD.Owen and Engine is tucked in interesting part of Bucktown right across form a movie theater. This is advantageous due to the fact it is two dollar parking there (or free if the attendant is grabbing a smoke and leaves the gate up like the two times I've gone). You walk in and you come into a pub that is dead on to the nicer ones you find in London. Warm carved wood everything and a nice medium-low lighting. Come on a date and sit at the lovely tables and booths, or grab a seat at the bar for some revelry.The staff are awesome, and you can try a sample of the quite-extensive taplist, as well as four beer engines to serve up real ales on cask. Our server/bartender was friendly as hell, and really knew his stuff. The beers were great, you can choose from any style your heart desires.As for the food, I have yet to try anything that doesnt' know it out of the park. The fish and chips are the best I've ever had with their crispy melt-in-your-mouth consistency (malt vinegar aioli, FTW), even better than what I had in London on the best trip of my life. Get the Bangers and Mash if you're not a fish guy/gal, and pair it up with a brown ale on tap. At the time they had Hobgoblin, and it rocked with the food. Do not skimp on dessert, and get the Banofee pie. It will seal the deal on a great meal.I don't like to gush on places, there's often too much hyperbole in positive reviews (everyone does it from time to time), but this place is totally deserving. Well done, Owen and Engine."
"I don't think this spot can be considered a hidden gem anymore, but it is an amazing new farm to table restaurant. Huge beer and cocktail menu, eclectic menu and classy decor. Highly recommend checking it out!"
"Oh how I loved this place! My sister and stumbled on it today while waiting for a movie in rainy May. I had heard about this place! Let me start with saying that sitting at the bar is great choice! The bartender was super friendly and really knows his stuff. The beer selection is fantastic! Just tell the bartender what you like and he will pair you with the perfect pint. Now on to the food, my sister had the Ploughman's platter which she loved. All the bread and ham is made in house too! I had the burger and let me tell you I ate it so fast! It's made with chuck and short rib and cooked to perfection! I also recommend adding the cheddar. I will return soon for dinner and some dessert! And of course more beer!"
"Great spot, a little out of the way (not a bad thing), and found free parking after a little bit of a search. Expected more of a crowd, but it was Black Wednesday, the weather was horrible, so we were glad to find no wait. The first floor was generally filled upon arrival, but we wanted to sit upstairs and had no problem (party of two) with no reservations.....The upstairs is really nice, the fireplace was great and it's much warmer and cozier. Even with a small vestibule off the street, the first floor is quite drafty when both doors are opened at the same time. When leaving, you could really notice the change in temperature coming downstairs.Tried a few beers on draft, we just wanted some bites and drinks. We weren't feeling the entrees - will go back for the fish and chips - and couldn't decide on anything to split since we weren't that hungry. We chose the cheese plate (listed under desserts, but totally acceptable as a starter) and the charcuterie, then split the cobbler for dessert. It was a good way to sample things and not over order.A nice first visit, impressive setting, looking forward to brunch and sampling more of the menu."
"Going here before seeing Tron in 3-D, I asked my good friend if we needed reservations and he was like ""No, it's a bar.""...Thankfully, a person in our party got here earlier than the rest of us, though we couldn't sit at a table because we had 5 people? Thankfully, the bar upstairs didn't have anyone sitting at it, so down we sat.The boyfriend and I split the burger and the others in our party got fish and chips. While the french fries were good and there was VINEGAR available (i love vinegar), the burger was really good. We even got it medium well (because the bf is picky) but it was still very juicy and not at all dry, which was good. It was seasoned well and didn't need anything else to make it any better. Seriously. I would come back for this. I tried the fish as well, and it was lightly battered and well flavored. I also am considering getting it next time. Hell, I'll just get everything next time.We ordered a lot of different beers, especially the cask beer, which you don't find many places, so it's definitely worth a try. They also have a lot of awesome things on tap, so really beer=yum.The atmosphere is a bit stuffy, I guess more so if it's early in the evening, but the bartenders were really nice to us and we had good conversation with them the whole time through our meal. If it were closer to my house, I'd probably be here a lot more often."
"Went here for brunch, looking for something new. Have been all over Logan square & needed a change. We had the hash, eggs Benedict & homemade sticky buns. Everything was delicious & fresh. The service was lovely - was the perfect atmosphere. We will be back to try dinner!"
"I'd go 4.5 stars with this joint...British fare kicked up to new levels + top notch craft brew list = win.I've been going to The Duke for years, and was using that as basis by which to compare fish & chips in this city to, but that's all over now.  Owen & Engine just took top honors...they brilliantly use haddock, which imparts a much better flavor.  Then you add a perfect breading, proper doneness (*just* cooked through) & a delicious ""Sauce Gribiche"", all served on top of mushy peas (which are the freshest I've had in any form)...just too good for words.Also got to try the Rasher & Farm Egg sandwich.  Wow.  A+++.  So good, I want one for breakfast tomorrow.  Shit, I'd have one for breakfast every day, if I could.The server knew his beers up, down and sideways...but being the alcoholic that I am, his help was unnecessary...went all West Coast with the Firestone Walker ""Walker Reserve"" Robust Porter and the Rogue McRogue Scotch Ale (a wee heavy).  Clean lines, but a tad too cold for the styles.  Still, the selection is awesome - Founder's, North Coast, Bell's, Lagunitas, Brooklyn, Magic Hat, etc..To top it all of, an *amazing* goat cheese cheesecake.  I was skeptical, but damn....So yeah, relaxed atmosphere, good service, great beer, fantastic food.  This place effin' rocks."
Never disappointed.  If the weather cooperates it is lovely to sit on the rooftop deck.  If the weather is not cooperating the lounge upstairs is very inviting.
"The best fish and chips in the city. Not!Try crisping up those fillets, Owen & Engine. Mine were a soggy mess. Tasty, but a soggy mess. Otherwise, cute little joint, with ample quality drinks. No stars off for the annoying dad and his son who tried to snake our seats at the bar. We had to do a serious stake-out to get our butts on those barstools in that tiny bar area."
"I've driven by Owen & Engine many times but never had the time to stop by.  A group of us went Friday night and I loved it.  I didn't know that Engine in the name means beer engines.  I'm in love as I brew beer!  However, I'm recovering from tonsillectomy and my taste buds are so screwed up that I can't review their beers.  A couple of guys in the group had 2 or 3 beers and gave them thumbs up.  None of us had any food so I can't review that but I will be back soon and then I'll review the beer for myself and the food (how good can English food be ;-)  ).  The atmosphere and service was very good also."
"To be honest, I walked in and almost wanted to walk out after looking at the brunch menu. It wasn't as extensive as I like, there were no fish & chips, and it was kinda pricey. The average brunch entree runs $14. However, we decided to give it a shot. We sat at the bar, and the bartender was extremely friendly. He knew his stuff and made it a point to make us feel at home. We ordered the eggs benedict and burger. The eggs benedict were easily the best I've ever had. I'm not even a big benedict fan, but when you serve it on a homemade crumpet with bacon it's seductively good. The burger was amazing. The bartender said that it's a mixture of chuck, short rib, and one other delectable meat that I can't recall. The only thing I would suggest is extending their burger options on the menu. I really wanted to try the fish and chips, but they do not start serving them until dinner. According to the bartender, the fish is flown in every day and they sell out pretty fast.We were pleasantly surprised and couldn't get over how nice everyone was. We will definitely be back."
"Getting here early or having reservations are highly recommended for this place. 3 of us arrived at about 6:30pm on a friday and ended up ordering food and drinks at the bar since the tables were booked solid until 9pm. The bartenders were highly knowledgeable and friendly. The bar has a large selection of beers, spirits and a cocktail list worth looking at. Beer drinkers should inquire about the current cask selection. My husband ordered the bourbon barrel aged ribeye. He normally doesn't eat a cut other than a filet, but he was very glad he made an exception for this steak. The aging process helped break down the gristle. The worcestershire reduction was delicious both with the steak and the yorkshire pudding. The yorkshire pudding was a darker version of indian flatbread. My brother in law and I both couldn't choose between the fish and chips or the burger, so we each ordered one and swapped half. We both agreed that the fish and chips were some of the best fish and chips we've both ever had. They were light and fluffy and packed with flavor. The burger was phenomenal. The bartender elaborated on the ingredients of the burger, which includes several different kinds of meat, giving this burger a particularly unique taste. All in all at the end of the night we were glad we sat at the bar because we were able to ask the bartenders all sorts of questions about the drinks and the food."
"I am now a big fan of Owen and Engine.  We went here for brunch and I loved the atmosphere, the decor, the food and the service.  We sat upstairs in what felt like a home with the fire going and the decor that made me think of my parents house, not a bad thing in my book.  The tea and scones made me feel like I was back in London.  The waitress was awesome and talked about the food enthusiastically to the point of making me want to come back for dinner.  I loved everything about this place and will definitely be back."
"Cool place, right across the street from the movie theater so if you get there early or aren't ready to go home after the movie this is a great spot. Very English feeling inside and at the bar with a wide selection of beers form a variety of countries...even have a few cask ales on tap.. warm, slightly carbonated strong ales aren't really my thing but who am I to judge...aside from the Miller Lite drinkers.Anyway, didn't have food but had the spiced bar peanuts and they were great and apparently home made, as is their linked sausage apparently.  All the food I saw looked good, smelled some curry so I would be interested in eating there. Will definitely have to try the fish and chips even though they were a bit pricey.I think this place is new because for one I have never seen it before but the people behind the bar, also possibly the owners, were really really friendly. Unusually so in fact. I doubt that will last long but who knows.Yes, it is a bar. at first it almost looks like a restaurant that merely has a bar but although they have food, I think this would still be considered a pub...Kind of a fancy pub as most of the people there were slightly dressed up so it certainly isn't a place you are going to go play darts, pool, listen to a juke box and get loud while you fill out your fantasy football sheets."
Came in for brunch. Horrible waitress. Kind of ruins everything.I love the look of this place. Beer list is good. The prices are a tad high for what you get. 12 bucks for a salad with four leaves of romaine is embarrassing.Weird location. Doubt I'll be back.
"Having a group dinner out with 8-16 people?  Go to Owen and Engine and request the semi-private back room upstairs!  There were 12 of us there on a recent weekend night, and we were surprised and excited to find ourselves in a beautiful, intimate space at this new restaurant.  I was captivated by the decor- the pattern on the wallpaper is repeated in a different color scheme in the bathroom and in smaller, muted tones on the various menus we were offered.  Beautiful attention to detail!  The location was a little off the beaten path and not easily accessible from public transportation, at least from the east side of the city, but I am glad we put in the extra effort to make it over.We were slightly disappointed to find that only one beer was offered on cask the evening we were there, since the promise of multiples was a major factor in going.  The draft beer list isn't huge, but is full of interesting and occasionally surprising selections, and I anticipate it will rotate seasonally.  Some in our group also ordered (and loved) several bottles of the Lorgeril Pennautier Red Blend.Order the charcuterie and the cheese and chutney plates and prepare to fill up on them- we started with them and definitely over-ordered for the rest of the meal.  The sweet onion jam was amazing, as was the fresh honeycomb accompaniment.  The menu is cool and small, but unfortunately lacking for vegetarians.  I lucked out with a rich and hearty barley vegetable soup of the day, and also had the salad, which was good if basic and with overly large pieces of cheese.  Others in our party loved their meals, especially the fish and chips, butter chicken, and bangers and mash."
"We had a great night catching up with a couple of friends here and were  very pleasantly surprised by the service, decor and the food. This place is located right next to a movie theatre, so you can expect a lot of folks killing some time here, as well as the locals in the area. What we didn't expect to find in this pub / restaurant was a great dinner menu that was perfectly executed.Upon the waitress' recommendation, we started with some very good drinks (Pimmes for me). Then came the cheese plate. For the entrees, the four of us ordered the bangers & mash, fish & chips, roasted chicken, and Slagel Farm beef burger. We then finished up by sharing the apple cobbler and banoffee dessert. For a snowy, slushy night outside, this type of food hit just the right spot!Four people, total with 20% tip included was $190. A bit more expensive than your usual bar food, but then again, this isn't your cheap local bar, so this was definitely worth it."
Mussels were to die for! They came with potatoes and chorizo. mmmm.Fish and chips were amazing. I can't wait to go back to try it again!Bit on the pricey side but well worth it.
"After long thought, I do want to raise my star value to 4.  I can't think of another bar in the city that offers such quality food, great service, and I can still feel cozy and relaxed.  I promise next time I am getting a jar of pickles.  But I won't eat them like snookie."
"When we arrived, there were no open tables and a wait. And we arrived just after they technically stop serving the full menu. (They have a pub menu after 10:00PM.) Things were not looking so good for our dining experience.But the hostess suggested we check the first-come, first-served tables upstairs in the bar area, noting that she had just seen some people leave from there. While I glanced at the menu before we ventured upstairs, the hostess excused herself to find out if ordering from the full menu was still possible. When she returned, a woman who I assumed was the manager came with her. The manager took us upstairs and showed us our options of open tables. We ended up in a quiet nook next to a window with a good view of the street outside. She said a server would be with us momentarily and left us with the full menu. All potential problems with our dining experience eliminated!The server was very attentive, courteous, and informative. Our food was fantastic. My girlfriend had the delicious burger, and I had the massive ribeye, which was cooked to perfection. (I ordered very rare and boy was it!)If we weren't completely stuffed, I would've ordered dessert. But I'll do that the next time we are there (which I expect will be soon).P.S. - They have a really good trappiste quadrupel on the extensive beer menu. I highly recommend it."
"An excellent place.  Parking can be difficult because its across the street from a movie theater.  The first word I'd use to describe this place is civilized:  professional staff, thoughtful menu, coffee served in a real coffee service.  The food is refined, unique & delicious.   The Scotch Egg is amazing (for those who like Scotch eggs, which, admittedly, are not for everyone).    To be fair - this place is not inexpensive, & I'm not sure how well it would work for a night of casual drinking, but definitely good for a night of  sampling a beer menu with breadth & depth.On a related note, what is with the new tradition of linking two disjointed words with an ampersand & calling it a bar?  Longman & Eagle, Bangers & Lace, Owen & Engine?  I am sure there are others.  Don't get me wrong - if there was a society for the promotion of the ampersand, I'd be a member, as I think it is one of the most valuable logo-grams in the English language.   Maybe yelp should jump on the bandwagon, & become the ""Yelp & Falcon""  or the ""Yelp & Battleaxe""?"
"Just got home from Owen & Engine and it was fantastic!  I'm not going to sit here and try to think of a witty review to post about this place, so I'm just going to say the following:Atmosphere: Very cute and comfortable.  We sat upstairs and the the music was at a perfect level where I could hear what my husband was talking about.  Service: Very attentive.  The server made sure we had our beers quickly and the food came extremely quickly.Food: YUM.  We both ordered the fish and chips and let's just say that we both completely cleared our plates.  The malt vinegar aioli on the side was very tasty.  All in all, a great dinner.  We will definitely be frequenting this place!  Loved it"
"This gastro-pub is fantastic.  Real ale, great spirits, delicious food.  Dishes with a pedestrian origin -- Scotch eggs, roast chicken, burgers, fish and chips -- are delicious here."
"Not sure why everyone is losing their minds about this place.  To be fair, this style of food doesn't excite me much, so I went in not really expecting to be super impressed.  The food was good, but not something I'd make a special trip for.  The presentation was nice, and the service was fine.  I did really love the restaurant decor - very cozy and antique feeling, making you want to spend a while there, but.... don't expect to, because it gets really crowded and loud by 6 pm, so it's not a place you can wander in for a drink or a meal, or linger for a while after you finish.  The beer list was ok (we tried four, none were spectacular), but all of them seem to come in 14 oz goblets at $6-7 - about the price of an average full pint elsewhere.  I guess I'd say this place is fine, but at the price point (moderately spendy; two entrees & four drinks + tax & tip our bill was around $75), if I were going out for a special meal I'd choose a place with more flavor variety (such as the Hopleaf - more food AND beer choices).  Most of the menu seemed to be a variation on salty meats with mayo-based sauces (vegetarians - don't bother going here).  We had the Ploughman and the burger.  Both were good, but not incredible (but again, this *type* of food never strikes me as that amazing).  Also a word of warning - we just barely squeezed in our party of two since we arrived at about 5 PM, and that with a warning from the hostess that we had to be about within 1 hr 15 min for a coming reservation.  Starting around 6ish my impression is you have to have a reservation to get in at all."
"I want to like this place more than I do. I am a Brit abroad, I miss some of my home comforts occasionally and this place could have filled the gap. Have been to O&E twice. First time round, they had the Pasties on the menu. Second time, gone......this was one of the only legit British items on the menu. When I went just recently, there was a Scottish haddock appetizer (which was very good) and the bangers & mash and fish & chips options that were remotely in line with the theme. I think the place has a good concept but it doesn't live up to it. The service is attentive and the fact everything is made in house is commendable. Just drop the allusions of being British themed as it isn't quite working out. If they bring in Yorkshire Puddings then I will be seeking a table out soon. The absence of this most English of delicacies lets them down a star or two. I think this place will improve and I look forward to more challenging fayre on the menu."
"I went to eat here last night.  I had the chicken, very good!  I was cooked perfectly, and not greasy, with crispy skin.  So yummy, I even eat all my veggies, including the brussel sprouts!  My husband had the bangers and mash, which I tasted.  The potatoes seemed overworked to the point that the tasted like mashed potatoes that come from  flakes in a box.  The sausages were good, but small, and he only got two.  He was still hungry after dinner.  I gave only three stars due to the price, and I am not sure there is much more on the menu I would want to try.  But the vibe was a bit wierd, reservations for a pub?  We also sat right by the window and we were very cold.  They built this place from the ground up and only put in single pane glass.  Really?  In Chicago?"
"The girlfriend had a hankering for fish and chips one day, and I'd heard great things about this place, so we elected to come here (despite the drive from Rogers Park, El isn't really an option unless you want to hoof it for several blocks). She: fish and chips (duh) and some sort of cider. She was nice enough to let me have some, I personally would not have shared their deliciousness.Me: an amazingly tasty burger, and (several) bell's amber. Both came with fries and malt vinegar aoli, which was superlative as well.Service was great, love the atmosphere too. I only wish public transit was a better option, but you can't fault them for that.They have a few cask beers as well, though I didn't try them, but I always appreciate the effort.All in all, a top-notch pub in every way. If I could own a bar, I'd want it to be exactly like O&E."
"Loved this place. My date and I had a very intimate dinner experience while sampling each other's dishes and the wait staff were very helpful. The only issue I had was that I couldn't try everything on the menu, because everything sounded so good. Will definitely be back"
"This place has some great potential. It is very beautiful space, looking very Anglo, but in a good way - a decidedly masculine-but-proper feel. My party of 5 arrived on Friday night at 8pm without reservation - to find out that we would be waiting two hour for a table. After taking a look at the second story bar, we decided we'd wait. There was room to stand and socialize up there, and like I said, its a great space. I will say, however - if had come to be a choice of staying downstairs for the wait or leaving, we would have left. Packed to the point that one could not even move or even think about getting a drink, it was extremely loud, pushy-shovey-  place to hate right away. Add a snobby Maître d'  and we nearly were out the door. But the Manager suddenly appeared, seemed to sense the unhappiness and ushered us right upstairs. Nice. We were happy. Beer! Poured at proper (British) temp, via beer engine. Nice touch, A very respectable collection of Ale kept us happy for the evening. The place was noticeably less full around 10:30, but alas still no table for us. Apparently they feel that five people is a ""Large Group"" (quote intended) and even after 2.5 hours they were unable to seat us. I'll go back because I did like the place, but will make sure I have a reservation first. Waitstaff seems dressed with the 'scally lad' look which is pretty creative but apparently difficult to execute well, as evidenced by some pretty sloppy looking characters. Seems a touch out of step with this very nice place. And while I know O&E is pretty new, (and I'm hoping that this is not part of the ""uniform"")... Rude waitstaff is never a good idea. Especially when you are sitting around for 2+hours spending money and hoping to eat. Just a thought. In the end, we had a good time socializing here. 2.5 hours waiting to seat our ""Large Group"" though was just too much, and we wound up eating elsewhere."
Nice to see a great place open in the neighborhood.  I love the look and feel of O&E.  But the upstairs bathroom is my favorite decor.  I had one of the best burgers I've had in ages. We started with the HAIRY TADDIES which was delicious and shared an order of  BUBBLE and SQUEAK - YUM.  We ended a fantastic meal with Chocolate FINANCIER which I couldn't pronounce but had no trouble eating.
"Walking through the doors at Owen & Engine you are immediately greeted by a very traditional English pub feel. In other words, bad-ass.The vibe, ambiance, branding, and overall representation Owen & Engine exudes is pretty excellent. This is actually why I gave it 3 stars.So menu time comes and, having waited to be seated for 20 minutes I chose to use that time wisely by turning to fellow yelpers in order to insure my meal quality.I ordered what seemed to be a pretty traditional English meal, fish & chips.Pretty hard to fuck up right? Wrong!The breading was falling off, the fish was terrible quality, greasy as all hell (and I expected grease). In fact, the fries were this dish's saving grace.Moral of the story is if you want to dine in a english/hipster themed pub and don't give two shits about your food don't read any further and just go!"
I was disappointed about the quality if the food given the rave reviews I read in Yelp.  Pub food was overpriced and quality was mediocre at best.
"The owner of Fat WIlly's knocks another one out of the park.  I love Owen and Engine, though I've only ever eaten here for brunch a handful of times.  The English fry up breakfast is amazing (I was just in England before that big Royal Wedding so I have a reference), Owen and Engine takes the traditional English dishes and turns it up a notch.  Most everything from the bacon, to the pickled celery in your Bloody Mary is made (or cured) on site.  The attention to detail is evident, in that every dish is a delight.  Try the clotted cream on a scone, or the hot chocolate, or even just order a coffee or tea, you'll see what I mean.  The restaurant and staff is casual but very polished.  All and all wonderful, and highly recommended."
"Awful! Way over priced! We ordered the meatballs, ham and cheese sandwich and fish and chips. $7 for three small sized meatballs; $14 for half a ham and cheese sandwich (I say half since they only give you one slice of bread for the ""sandwich""); $18 for two pieces of fish. Ridiculous! What made it even worse, and why I'm writing this review, is the ham on the ham and cheese sandwich was 75% fat. It was disgusting! When we told our server he said that he would tell the kitchen. No offer to discount the fat ham sandwich, no apology or anything. He even had the nerve to ask ""more fat than normal ham?"". He could have just looked at the plate that had chunks of ham fat around it! Why did we wait so long to complain about the ham? Because he was he was nowhere to be found after we got our entrees. We also had no refills on our drinks while we were eating. I would not recommend Owen and Engine!"
"Wow! The consensus is correct, Owen & Engine knows their stuff! The small bites as well as the fish and chips, whole trout and steaks were all excellently executed. Cocktails were stretching a bit so I would recommend sticking with the hand pulled beers (from the engine.) The desserts are fairly traditional but good.  A solid meal overall in a rather inconvenient location."
"Was shocked to find no elevator upstairs. After a recent lung infection, I had to take 3 rest stops on the way up that looooong flight of steps.  Also, all t he food is hand  carried up that same flight.  I ordered the salad with duck, and it came uncooked, raw and red.  I sent it back, asking it to be cooked.  After. A very long wait ( everyone else was almost finished with their meal) they delivered shriveled, tasteless, tough overdone meat. The dominant flavor was salt.  Had to ask server for more bottles of water.  The automatic 18% gratuity  was a very difficult to swallow; it wasn't earned. Another group member has difficulty going down stairs, so she struggled down that long flight as well. I'll never go back. It's NOT accessible, the food was awful, and there are m any better choices."
"This place is amazing! Excellent English pub food with a nice beer selection. The service was great and attentive. I had the burger, try it...delicious. The burgers are made up of three different cuts of beef with all beef ground on premises. I had the We had a group of nine and the wait was a little long but we had a few cask beers at the bar while waiting. The bar tender was a little quirky weird but that made the night interesting. The hostess was kind and kept checking in with us while we waited. She was a verrrrdy nice. The lighting is low and the interior design was fitting for the style of food. Make sure you feel the wallpaper upstairs, it is soft and feels like velvet. I liked it and so did the others that I pointed to try it. alright...enjoy"
"Our friend loves it there, so we went. However, we'll never go back. Let's face it, the English are not known for their food. On top of that, the selection was soooo bloody limited, we worked hard to find things of interest on the menu.Drink options are very limited. I wanted any kind of a martini other than the ONE kind they offered with olive juice.  ""NO CAN DO"" and an explanation of a limited bar is what we got.  OK, they're following a theme here, so I'll have to back off.  So no cranberry juice or pomegranate --- fine, we'll manage.We ordered a bunch of plates -- salad, pork rinds, olives, and wings. All pretty average.  (We could not find an entree that suited us. There were but a few to begin with.)   The wings we had were impossible to manage, either by hand or with knife and fork.  Meat did not want to come off the bone.  I ended up in the restroom, trying to get the sticky sauce off. I even brought we paper towel back for my spouse.  I was taken back by the horrid ergonamics of the bar. Glad we sat at a table. The bar stools were quite large and deep, yet the bar  overhang was almost nonexistent.   No way you'd ever be able to maneuver food sitting that far away from the surface. It is a sobriety test even if you're just drinking. (15"" to 18"" overhang for a bar is standard, not 3"").It seems folks love it there. Just not us.  We don't get it."
"My third time dinning at O&E it was phenomenal. We had a small group of 5 and had no problems sitting on the patio. Our server Ryan was outstanding; very knowledgeable, patient, accommodating, and his recommendations were right on time. I asked a couple of times for oddball cocktails and he and the bartender (Jeremy?) didn't bat an eye, and executed them flawlessly. Finally had the Fish'n'chips I had heard so much about and they did not disappoint at all. We had come to brunch a few months ago and had the best corned beef hash in my life. Great Job guys, keep 'er up!"
"Visited Owen & Engine last Friday. It's a real gem. The atmosphere was that of an old English Pub, exactly what it was going for. The menu choices were a bit limited, and some items seemed to be a bit exaggerated in the price. However, overall they are successful at providing a very authentic menu. I had a lemonade, which is made to order...very refreshing. For an appetizer we had chips & a side of sauce - It was good, but not mind blowing. We also had some of the pickles, which were extremely good. For a main dish we both had a sandwich with thick cut bacon, a fried egg all on top of house-made bread. As a side was the mashed with cheddar - above average. All in all the dishes were above average, and the presentation was top notch. There is a second floor with a second bar, lots of seating & a fireplace - very charming. It's well worth giving a try. On a side note - there was a couple being seated before me. They had a young child with them - the hostess did not seem very accommodating. They didn't have any highchairs - what type of neighborhood restaurant does not have highchairs? Note to the management - you must at the very least not seem to be bothered by children, the look & reaction of the hostess seemed to be a bit snooty. Also descriptions of the food in plain English would be helpful as well."
"This place is super cozy and the staff was really attentive and nice.  I could definitely go back for a nice dinner and a movie date, although the prices were a little high for a normal evening dinner.  I tried the fish and chips and they were very salty, but super fresh and delicious.  The soup of the day came out with just the veggies and barley in the bowl and then they poured the broth in at the table.  It was pretty spectacular, although my friend didn't much care for it, so they comped her drink which was nice.Overall, pretty great, but you will probably drop $20 on the cheapest dinner."
"I'm not going to say anything too new, but wanted to add my two cents. Ate here last night with a friend before going to see a movie at the Regal across the street.  Let's start with the host wearing a bow tie. Superb!  The inside emulates a quaint and cozy English pub.  The wait staff is extremely helpful and polite. The food was yummy.  Food specifically: I had the wings and an order of the cheddar mash. The cheddar mash was a mouthful of happiness.  Flavor tickled every taste bud delightfully.  The brick oven wings were good, but lacked oomph.  Don't get me wrong, I liked the delicate flavoring, but was in the mood for something spicy.  They need a dipping sauce or just a sauce in general. Plus they were the whole wing pieces, and that posed a bit of a challenge to consume politely. My friend had the fish and chips. Big portions and the chips were really good (she wouldn't share a taste of the fish-I can conclude that it was just as good as my wings were.) Downside? As mentioned before the prices are too high for the food for it's peculiar location.  I love that there's another food option so close to the movie theater, but $40 for just food (no drinks) is just too pricey for a frequent pre-movie dinner."
"My husband and I went here on a Saturday night - had a reservation for 8 PM and were sat right away.  Love the look of the place, although it felt a bit incongruous across from glaring neon of the movie theatre.  Oh well...I'm always happy to see restauranteurs venturing into slightly unchartered territory.We had the delicious salad and the subpar meat pie as appetizers - both were reasonably portioned but slightly overpriced (especially the salad).  For entrees, we had the rasher & egg sandwich--very good--and fish & chips--very good.  We had 5 drinks total and no dessert - but the tab was still $100, which felt slightly high for a pub dinner.  I was thinking more the 65-70 mark.One thing I noticed here that I notice at a lot of restaurants - the HUGE rush between courses.  Boom-drinks! (and actually, amen for that) and then boom-appetizers!  and boom!  entrees.  I wish we could linger a bit longer over the courses.  That seems to be a lost art form at many places, not just Own & Engine.I'll be back for drinks - great beer list and the cozy atmosphere is perfecto for winter.  Not sure I'll be so eager to drop 100 bones on a full meal, though.The service was great, food was hot, so--all in all--a good night out. The three stars instead of four is honestly from the prices."
"When this place first opened, one of my buddies claimed he had dreams about their burger.  I thought it was a bit of an exaggeration.  A burger can't be that good.  I've had the burger (multiples times).  I have those dreams now too.  Loved the tunes they play in here as well.  Led Zeppelin III?  The whole thing?  Awesome."
"I have driven past this place so many times without noticing it. It wasn't until my husband and I had an hour to kill before a movie that we found ourselves there. We both really enjoyed it. They have a good selection of drinks, the service is great, and the food was tasty. I deducted a star because their food menu is pretty limited and they didn't offer a meatless choice. I eat fish so I just got the fish and chips and it was delicious.They serve Irish pub food which seemed pretty authentic from what I remember from a trip I took to Ireland a while ago. We will surely come back to this cute little pub."
"Been here twice. The staff has always been extremely friendly and helpful. The food is very good too if not a tad pricey. A lot of there stuff comes from local farmers so get there early before that days ingredients run out.  Twice now I have not been able to order the fish and chips because they ran out of fish for the night. Also, they have a lot of great beer, including cask ales."
"This place is so cozy and classy! The house made sausages and burgers were delicious! The burgers were made from quality meat, not just your regular run of the mill ground beef. They had a great beer selection, too! My friends and I will be back sometime soon to sit upstairs by the warm fireplace!"
"My boyfriend and I went last night on a date. We were excited for the deal that they have on Tuesdays--burger, beer, and a shot of bourbon for $15. The waitress even knew that we were there for that deal and it was the first thing she asked when we sat down. It made it that much easier. I've been to Owen & Engine 3 times now and I have to say the food is great..the burger I ordered was perfect...full of flavor, cooked just how I like it and the bun was soft, buttery and delicious...superb!,The draft beer selection there can be hit or miss sometimes so I'd just stick with their signature cocktails! The dessert is fantastic!!!! I've tried the cookie sandwich and the chocolate pudding cake thing YUM!--its making my mouth water just thinking about it. The only thing is the service isn't the best. The hostess was not very confident with presence and had a very shy candor..not too smooth, maybe she was new? The waitress was sweet but towards the end of our meal she did not come back to check on us. The place was pretty empty so it's not like she was busy. I had mentioned to her in the beginning of our meal that we definitely were interested in getting dessert but she never returned. The bartender actually was the one who cleared our table.  My boyfriend had to get up and ask a different waitress for a dessert menu. The staff at Owen and Engine has always been a bit weird and quirky. The last time I was there our waitress kept joking around with us and was extremely sarcastic..and good thing my friends and I are pretty chill so we let it slide but we all thought it was inappropriate behavior at a place that I consider classy, especially in Logan Square. But other than that, the food is fantastic and the ambiance and vibe is really soothing and romantic. I'll definitely being going again and I definitely want to try other things on the menu because everything on it sounded GREAT!"
"This comfy new British Pub just opened its doors. When we walked in, we were blown away by the atmosphere. The layout is wonderfully welcoming.  Go upstairs, grab a seat on the couches that surround the fireplace, order the fish and chips and a pint of Poperings, a really good Belgian beer. We found the wait staff to be friendly and knowledgeable, & the bartender offered tastes of some of the other draught beers on the menu. Next time I'm ordering Goose Island Sofie.  This is my first Yelp review, I was that impressed."
"Although I hadn't intended for this to be another stop on my Great Burger Hunt, it turns out they serve a darn good burger.  I'm beginning to realize that although the burger itself may be the quest, it really is the experience that makes or breaks the meal.  O&E deliver on both counts.  The burger itself (with English cheddar) had a great 'earthy' taste that matched well with the onion roll and carmelized onions.  The chips were also very good.  They must have been as I finished the leftovers from everyone else at the table.  Twice someone tried to remove the remaining fries and I stopped them both times.  Other than the burger, others had the fish and chips which got good reviews.  We all needed some suggestions on beer choices and the Two Brothers Northwinds Imperial Stout was the overall winner.  The cask pour tends to be a little warmer than some may be accustomed to so don't be surprised.  Our server knew his beer and his recommendations were all very good.  The atmosphere upstairs is like sitting in someones living room.  Very cozy and gives the appearance that the place has been here forever.   Dinner with a couple of beers each ran about $35 per person.  Not too bad given the good food, good beer, and helpful suggestions by our server.  By 6:30 on a Saturday it looked like every table was filled so we don't seem to be alone in our high praise.  $2 parking acoss the street was a nice surprise.  We were told when the exit booth is empty, parking is free!"
Fantastic food. Fish & chips are awesome. Beer served from an engine is cool. Authentic English atmosphere. Cozy upstairs. I didn't find the prices to be out of line--good value. Very knowledgeable server.
"i rather not write an exhaustive, lengthy, in-depth review like my peers have so instead, i will say this:if you're willing to fork over 17 on the best fish and chips you can find in chicago, then get the hell over to owen & engine right now. this shit melted in my god damn mouth."
Maybe just a bad night.  We waited at least a half an hour between appetizers and main course. The hamburger was overcooked.   The soup was delicious.  They have some $5 cocktails on Monday nights that were quite good.
"Fish and Chips were the best EVER!! Sooooo good! Took my BF here for Birthday Dinner, he'd been dying to try this place out for months! So I finally made it happen...what my baby want my baby get....So he ordered Bangers and mash and half way through we switched because he just HAD to have a taste of the fish n chips, I couldn't let him not experience that deliciousness place was very nice, we were seated upstairs and it was quite cozy and so nice.  The server was great and he recommended some beers, which I liked but the Bf wasn't a fan...Dessert was sooo good, a souffle of sort, sorry I can't remember name.  Anyway, I loved it...was very good.  Would I go back? More like when am I going back cuz I can't wait!"
"The burger will change your idea of what a burger should be. The place is a little pricey, but definitely worth the splurge. Very cozy atmosphere. I can't wait to come here and plop down on the couches with a beer and some good friends. Warm and inviting. Good beer list. A somehow classy casual irish pub with really excellent food. Welcome to the hood."
"You have to drive several miles on Western to find another place half as good as this.  The staff are excellent, the drink selection is excellent, and although I haven't had a full entree here, as far as I know, the food is excellent too.  Make a point of going here for a bite or a couple drinks.  If you are for some reason going on a date to the theater directly south of here, you owe it to yourself to make it dinner and a movie, and hit up O&E."
"A great bar and pub that serves great food and beer and which I hope continues to do so in the future.  Exceptional features include: the bar tenders dress in a funky way that really fits the aesthetic of the place, really nice British food (which hitherto now I thought was a contradiction in terms), there is no music so you can actually talk with your friends.  A good place to get a drink and a bite and talk, if you're looking for less of a conversational venue and more for a place where you can meet new people then head elsewhere."
"I have been WAITING to try this place out and when I did I was so happy.There was a long wait, a wait to get menus, our drink orders, our drinks and finally our food....the only thing that would compensate my wait was that the food had to be good, and by golly it sure it was!I order the charcuterie plate, and the bone marrow dish-both from the small plate menu.It was dee-lish!!!   They gave me a lot of bone marrow and it was scrumptious(compared to Longman and Eagles, smaller portion).  The sausage plate is a meat lovers delight!  It comes with house made sausages, beef heart and mustard.  I wasn't too crazy about the beef heart but all the other sausages were sooooo yummy.  Definitely worth the $19 small plate!  (Also, there small plates were very filling).I am definitely coming back to try more things on their menu(I was rushed because I had a movie to catch)... and will give insight to its other menu items. I had a Pimm's cocktail and it was alright.  Nothing special- I still believe the best bartenders are at Longman and Eagle and the Violet Hour.  The ambience is darling and I highly recommend this place as a place to bring a date."
"First impressions are lasting ones and this first impression was so bad that it'll be a LONG time before I ever go back. First off, we didn't drink or eat there.  In fact, we went on a Saturday afternoon around 3:45.  We walk in and a guy is standing in the doorway.  Doesn't say a word to us, just looks at us so I figure he's waiting for the hostess.  So we stand there and wait...and wait...and wait and finally the CHEF comes out to talk to this guy standing in the doorway because he's there for a job interview????  I wouldn't hire this guy if someone paid me. After we tune in to the fact that he's not waiting to be seated we shove past him and try to find SOMEONE to help us.  We finally found a waitress that was twirling her hair by the bar who informed us that we can sit where ever we want but they aren't serving food.  WHAT???  3:45 in Chicago on a Saturday and they aren't serving food at a ""pub""?   I get the whole maybe not serving dinner before 4 or 5 pm but at this point in the game I was so annoyed by the whole door thing that this just pissed me off really bad. I really wanted to like this place and give it a try, but it seems like everyone there is in outer space and doesn't know the first thing about customer service....In fact, just thinking about it, I'm getting steamed."
"This place totally rocks! First off, the ambiance is amazing-- the interior is beautifully designed and the lighting is just the right warm yellow glow. They have both an upstairs and an outdoor patio, which makes the space much more open (unlike Longman & Eagle, for example). In fact, I was shocked that a party of four didn't have to wait for a table at all at 9pm on a Friday night (don't know if this is normal for them? I do know they take reservations, though)! There is something of a Rootstock feel to it--not too loud and great for conversation. On to the food and drink. I ordered the ""Wounded Swede"" cocktail and it was awesome- lovely strong juniper earthy flavor. And our server patiently explained the ingredients to me (Boomsa, Bonal Quina, Malort, Cherry Heering, Orange Bitters). I then tried ""The Good Stuff Sour"" which was also quite good. Far more delicate eggwhite/lemon/rye made it taste neither too boozy nor too sweet. They also have a great selection of interesting craft beer both on tap and in the bottle. Finally we ordered the Wings and the Cornish Pastry. The wings were good but the pastry was delicious. Make sure you combine the chutney with the pastry--the taste is much more interesting. Our server was very chill and helpful, and I was amazed that they didn't harry us out when we ended up as the last table upstairs. All in all I will definitely be back. It's awesome to have a place that is a bit more low key (and less expensive!) than something like Publican or Longman, but pushing on the just as fun and delicious."
"Have been here a number of times to sit at the bar (or at least we tried to).  Was here most recently for dinner and had a fabulous time.  We had the oysters to start and the fish and chips and the clam chowder for entrees.  All were excellent, as was the service.  Drinks are on the spot and the beer selection is wonderful.  The coffee I had at the end of the meal was amazing.  I only gave four stars because the place is so tiny!  Whether you are at either bar or eating at one of the tables it always feels crowded.  I will be back, of course, but wish they could expand their seating options.  Maybe keep the bar upstairs and reserve the downstairs for diners?"
On a whim one Saturday afternoon I visited this fine establishment.  The experience was great and I can't wait to go back.  I shared the pot of house made pickles which was delicious.  It came out in a mason jar and was an assortment of veggies all pickled.  Yums!!  Also we had the pork belly appetizer which melted in your mouth.  The bartenders were a nice sight and very friendly.  The decor is awesome and the wallpaper in the ladies bathroom is velour and soft to touch.  I look forward to my next visit - might just have to see how their brunch is.
Great food.  Great atmosphere.   Great service.  What more could one ask?  Oh and did I mention how great they are?
"Tall, dark and handsome."
"I got hot chocolate and cinnamon toast here at midnight. That is awesome! It was also really freaking good. My friend who came with ordered an entire tea service at the same hour complete with scones and cream. We were hungry. And then we had some beer. All in all it was a lovely evening. The whole place is charming and pretty, especially the upstairs. You'll like it."
"Went with a work colleague on a Sunday night, 8pm reservation.  We travel for conventions and have our pick of restaurants so were able to sample a lot of Chicago upscale food.  The ingredients here are locally sourced, fresh, and the cooking reflects a trust in this, simple, not overly combined or overly rich or overly spiced.  Had Scotch Egg--delicious, Pork Rinds, a bit dry, but maybe that's normal, i haven't had them before.  I had Fish and Chips, texture and temperature were perfect, just simple, very very good.  Mashed potatoes with cheddar cheese sounds heavy, but this version wasn't, had incredible flavor--best thing I ate all week (including food at Frontera Grill).  My colleague had a steak and said it was excellent.  We noticed that the steak prices were 1/2 of the price of downtown steak houses.  One thing to be aware of is that the food takes a long time to come out.  I get the impression that everything is made to order and nothing is pre-made, but this means appetizers arriving 25 minutes after ordering and entrees at least a half hour after appetizers arrive.  I'm ok with this but it's noticeable in comparison to other restaurants.  Our waiter was unobtrusive, knowledgable, personable, hip, but interested in us--the hostess was friendly, cool.  The customers were young.  Lots of people on dates or out with friends. I'm in my 40s but felt completely comfortable w. the vibe I thought there had to be a university nearby, but the waiter said it's because of the movies across the street.  Prices were mid range, we spent about $90 for two with drinks, appetizers and entrees, and tip.  Solid experience, memorable food, I'd most definitely come back."
"My expectations were not high given the British food theme. And my expectations were not exceeded. While the hosts were friendly, we did wait 60+  minutes  beyond our reservation time.  The restaurant did purchase our party our first round of drinks once we sat.  My party of 4 all pronounced the food ""salty"".   I'd return for cocktails only-bar looks super comfy."
"I loved this place! My friend had her wedding rehearsal dinner here and thanks to generous dining partners I was able to sample the steak sandwich, burger, fish and chips, and their mashed potatoes. They had a decent beer selection and the attentive staff made sure our table was cleared and our water glasses were full. Highly recommended!"
"I went here having heard good things. Cute upscale bar atmosphere, but I found both our waiter and the menu to be a bit pretentious. We got the muscles, which were good, but not amazing and the burger which was very good. I thought the menu was a little pricey for what it was and the portions were on the smaller side. I would be open to going back and trying something else, but I'm not in a big rush."
So good! The pickled items to the amazing bangers and mash. I loved every moment of the place.
"Went here just this evening, and liked it so much I had to put in a review asap!  I had the fish and chips and the Missus had a burger.  We didn't get too adventurous, though the other food choices looked damned good, so I know we'll try other stuff soon.  The burger was the business!  A mixture of ground meats (chuck, brisket, and something else), very little seasoning (with that mixture of meats, it didn't need much), cooked perfectly, with the best caramelized onions i've had in awhile--some people don't have the time to saute' them long enough.  Perfect bun--just a great burger.  My fish was super moist.  Almost too moist.  Sometimes I like the fish to be a little lighter and fluffy, and theirs is seriously moist, almost dripping--but not oily.  I guess it's a highly subjective thing, fish and chips.  Still liked it, not overly battered, either, maybe a little splash of vinegar will do the trick next time.  Chips came in waxy paper inside a glass.  Served with this ridiculously good sauce.  The Missus said these were better than MK's truffle fries.  I don't know about that, but they were addictive. For drinks, the Missus had the Druid, which she really liked-very summery and not too heavy.  I had a Three Floyds Robert the Bruce on cask, and it was damned tasty!  Service was killer.   I haven't even spoke of the decor of the place, which has to be experienced to be believed, particularly on the second floor.  I thought it had a warm masculine feel to it, but our server said that the owner designed and decorated the place HERself, which may be why the Missus went buck-wild over it.  It's just an amazing color scheme and layout--woods with dark prints on the deep green walls.  A beautiful leather sofa and two leather chairs in the center with maybe a Thailand style table in the middle, all on an oriental rug.  This setup in the midst of dark dining tables and sturdy comfortable leather and wood chairs.  WTF--how much have I written!?  I started with a 4 but I think the whole experience is actually a 5 now that I think about it.  The dorkus view of the movie theater next door is really the only thing I didn't love, but they can't help that.  Sit on the second floor.  This place I love."
"the moment we walked in, we felt like we were on the set of downton abbey (in a good, peasant way). i wish lady grantham would have served us but alas, it was still a great experience. the atmosphere was very inviting and homey. the food was scrumptiously cooked. the chicken cassoulet was to drool for. crispy chicken skin with moist white and dark meat. the curried veggies and butternut squash soap were unassuming items on the menu but turned out to be winners. we also started with a jar of pickled veggies which made us wanting more."
"I do love it when i see a British pub because there are not many of them at all in Chicago.I came for brunch with a group and was impressed that it was all home made. The crumpets were nice and I appreciated that they were home made although I have neer had a truely home made crumpet before which was interesting. It's not very veggie friendly since a lot of the brunch stuff had bacon in it or was made with animal fat.I was still impressed with this find, they impressed me with their service and with their British menu which is always nice to see. It make's me feel, even for a minute that I could be in England. It is terrible to park around there unless you want to pay for the garage next door and its not easy to get to . I would love it, if this pub was in the loop or closer to the loop and CTA. You really have to know it's there or be referred there by someone. Cute find and I would go back again."
"This is one of my five favorite Chicago restaurants. Great, creative food; amazing beer selection; *four* freaking casks; and amazing service. Been four times, and every time has been the same: fantastic. Haven't been? Go!"
"I really don't like the name of this place... but aside from that the food although it sounds very good was sub par.  I ordered the Bangers and Mash and was severely disappointed.  I was with 6 others and their food looked sub par as well. The winner of the night for me was The Macallan barrel aged scotch.  I also thought it was pretty cool that they offered 3  ""Real Beers"" which have no nitrogen and no carbon dioxide pressure.  Overall since the food was mediocre it is hard for me to like this place."
"Great beer, great staff and great food. Listen to staff recommendations they are spot on."
"If you're looking for a traditional style burger, you're not going to beat Owen and Engine.  Honestly the best burger I have ever had!  Fan-freakin-tastic!"
"Like many yelpers, I typically post a review to:A) Share a bad experience and thus warn othersB) Praise a business and hope that others patronize itI just finished doing the former by lambasting Kuma's Corner.   I thought I'd post a review for a restaurant that goes above and beyond in many ways.We went here on a quiet Friday night in December and had a wonderful experience.  First, the parking was excellent in the theater garage (also easily accessible via the 49 bus.  The ambiance was amazing, and there was no wait.  Our waiter was friendly and super knowledgeable about the food and drink.  His drink suggestions were perfect and the drinks themselves were amazing.I had the rabbit ravioli and my girlfriend had the rasher & egg sandwich.  Both were amazing and we're going back on Valentine's Day to have more.  I might order both of those entrees while I'm there.  5 stars ."
"We love Owen and Engine! They make one of the best burgers in the city, and this is coming from someone who lives a block away from Kumas. Their fries are also cooked perfectly, and it comes with a very tasty dipping sauce. We also had the bone marrow escargot, and it was very buttery and it melted in your mouth. The best part about Owen and Engine is the service. The bartenders and waitresses are very friendly, and keep a lively conversation with the customers. The bartenders have given us several drinks and appetizers on the house, so we could try them, and I now found my favorite beer because of their generosity."
Try the...everything.  Delicious!
