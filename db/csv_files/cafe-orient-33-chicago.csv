Cafe Orient 33
"I come here about once a month (I used to come here twice a month when I was lazy to cook, haha). I am addicted to their wings, particularly the Sweet Garlic flavor. It's not overwhelmingly garlicky and balanced out with a sweet (obviously) and peppery flavor. I've tried nearly everything on their appetizer and entree menu, and each dish has a Korean/Asian fusion theme to it while still feeling like it's homey, comforting food.I also like that the menu sometimes changes and has new additions. I recall last summer was when the Pork Bulgogi Sandwich first came out--it was a very flavorful and unique twist to the Korean dish. Their BBQ fries were also added a few months ago, if I recall correctly. I highly recommend ordering them! They're sweet and smokey, and the portion is large.Service is wonderful here. Kelly and her husband (the owners) are genuinely nice and make you feel welcomed. You really can't go wrong with this place, especially for the price. I highly recommend eating here!Also, don't forget to places your dishes on the left by the register when you're done :)"
"3 stars for service, location, and value. I'm no expert in Korean food. I think this is my 2nd time ever eating Korean food so I'm really not a very good judge. I ordered something that looked popular -- bibimbap with beef. It came with noodles in the bottom, beef and veggies on top. I think this is an acquired taste to which I'm not accustomed to. And I really don't have anything to compare it to since I've never really eaten Korean food except for bulgogi. This dish is just ok to me. It was fresh and I liked the veggies. The meat was tender and was tasty but the veggies were plain and so were the noodles. It's kind of like eating pho for the first time, if you don't know to add the sauces, you won't enjoy it. The bbq French fries were tasty but definitely not an authentic dish to brag about. I'm just a fat girl looking for something familiar in an unfamiliar place. The place was clean and the service was good. Also the meal was uber cheap. So that's always awesome. I guess for newbies like me, you won't know til you try again. And I may, in the future."
"Super disappointing!  I got the wings in two flavors - Louisiana and Korean spicy.  The Louisiana is just nonsense - the sauce was terrible, and the chicken was mushy.The Korean spicy seemed a little better, at first.  But once you got through the crisp outer layer of what is passable sauce, you got to slimy, wet, and slightly spongy chicken meat that lacked flavor or edible texture.  The wings do seem gigantic, but I'd guess they are regular small wings that have retained water and sodium.  The whole thing just reeked of that really low quality spongy chicken that you'd get from cheap Chinese American lunch specials in suburban strip malls.I love fried chicken and I really love wings, but these are wings I couldn't even eat.  I'm just glad I had a side of kimchi to eat with some leftover rice."
"This is a place I can bring my asian family!  It's simple and inexpensive with a parking lot and lets you eat casually like a fast food joint. No weird interaction with the server constantly checking on you. Come and go as you please.As many have mentioned, the lady, whom I presume is the wife and husband team of the restaurant, were soft spoken and sweet. She pointed to me all the most ordered dishes and asked if I needed WiFi to study. I'm a little too old to be a student, granted, I had a backpack on, but to study? well, there are alot of students that roam around here I guess.Anyway, there are stacks of newspapers and magazines by the door and it's actually a pretty good size place with high ceilings and a soft sunny yellow interior. It's homey, warm and airy, which is such a contrast to the up and coming neighborhood. I've been to Korea before and there are definitely Korean elements with decor, plants and use of light wood.I got the Bibim noodles and Korean wings. I wasn't expecting much of the noodle dish, but the beef was really good. It's sweet, but has other savory flavors. The wings are pretty awesome too. It's a bit different, like there's a crunchy nutty coating, either it's deep fried garlic and the sauce is a bit spicier than I had at other places. I can only eat two, but probably the whole thing if I had some rice to go with,"
"Hands down one of the best dollar per taste bud value to be had. Btw, also BYOB so basically you make money by eating here!Get your wings on. Get your bibimbap on. The side dishes including kimchi are wonderful and the service is excellent. Simple place with very good food. Enjoy you beverage of your choice BYOB!"
"This is based SOLELY on the food alone. But if it was about service, I'd rate it a 4 because the people behind the counter were oh-so friendly and really cute! The guy behind the counter told me not to get the Louisiana sauce on the wings. Really appreciated the honesty haha even when it's against their own food.That said, I was very underwhelmed by the wings... I mean it has NOTHING on Crisp... The wings seemed too soggy and lost its crunch, which I'd expect from my Korean fried chicken! The sauce was also lacking in a kick... the garlic sauce was not garlicky or sweet enough nor did the korean sauce have enough of that chili paste flavor. I think the biggest problem is the texture of the chicken though ... just not crispy enough!I also ordered this octopus cooked with onions and hot peppers just out of curiosity. I must say though, I was disappointed but it's probably because I just don't like the tough texture of octopus. I really loved the milk tea. Get it hot and without the bubbles! They also have complimentary tea on the counter -- it's barley flavored and really pleasantly nice."
"Menu seemed confusing at first glance because it was so diverse! I ordered the bulgogi for take out during dinner time. Staff is friendly. Space is quiet and located in a plaza. Bulgogi was delicious. Rice was yummy - soft and slightly sticky. Kimchi had string radish and cabbage in it and tasted good, not that fermented, a bit salty... It was good but then again, I was super hungry when I ate it.It's a short walk from the Kimball brown line subway station. I would come back for food next time I'm in the area and want Korean food."
Went here on a Saturday afternoon with Nae L.  I was very happy to see a Korean place with chicken wings and high ratings on Yelp!!!I was a little surprised to find this place in the strip mall and the set up was more like fast food than casual dining and there were loads of college kids there being loud and very loud.  We grabbed and perused the menu and I ordered some popcorn chicken along with Korean and Sweet Garlic wings and we went up to the counter to pay.  For water you get a very small plastic cup to fill from an urn. The food took awhile to come out but the spicy Korean wings had a nice crisp to them and were probably double fried.  The sauces did not impress me much since the spicy Korean sauce seemed too concentrated in the sauce making it a little rough.  Sweet Garlic had very large chunks of raw garlic in it so the flavor was a bit overpowering.  The popcorn chicken was crunchy and came with Louisiana sauce which was spicy but not like Louisiana sauce.The real pro of this price is that the food is very affordable and very flavorful.  The cons are that it is very loud and will take a very long time to get food.  Overall I am a fan and would come back when I have a craving for Korean Chicken Wings.
"After having seen the famous Cafe Orient 33 on Yelp with nearly a 5 star rating, I decided to come in to see what all the hype is about. One bite later and I must confess that Heaven on Earth exists. This place was and is amazing. The chicken wings were freshly made to order. They were roughly $1 a piece but they are large and extremely flavorful. The sweet garlic and the spicy Korean sauce are a must try. In addition to this, I also had the opportunity to try the bibimbap and gyoza which were also phenomenal. Food is enough of a reason to give this place a try. Another outstanding quality that this place possesses lies within its customer service. The lady at the front was offering so much guidance in choosing what to order and she even gave us a few extra wings. She had a smile on the entire time and really valued her customers. She even thanked us when we left - so generous. Her efforts to keep us satisfied don't go unnoticed. I love this place and will definitely be back!"
They have 4 wing sauces available and many other entree dinner choices. The service was extremely fast and all the dishes were piping hot when they hit the table. Lots of flavor and a little spicy but even a weakling on the spice barometer can handle it.
"Nice, affordable place for Korean food, especially spicy wings.  At other Korean restaurants, the minimum order for wings can run close to $20.  With Cafe Orient 33, you have the option of ordering as little as 5 pieces for only $6.50!  Most of all, their wings are perhaps better than at more expensive eateries.  Also, service has always been great at this super clean, order-at-the-counter, mom and pop shop.Their ramen (Korean shin-style) was also good. Spicy pork dish wasn't bad, but not great.  Their wings definitely are the star of the show."
"Cafe Orient 33 proves that it is possible to offer high-quality Korean food at low prices (I have often wondered most Korean restaurants are really expensive when the ingredients don't really cost that much and the preparation time doesn't seem like it should be that long.).  The Korean Fried Chicken was really inexpensive and was crispy and the meat was still moist.  The tofu stew was flavorful, and the fried rice was a big hit too.I also liked the fact that hot tea was offered complimentary too and that tea seemed pretty decent to me."
"There's no excuse for not giving Cafe Orient five (5) stars.  I will break it down for you why that is:1) no need to tip: it says on their website.  Seriously, there's no chance to leave any tip; there's no line to write down the amount of tip on the merchant copy.  2) service is outstanding: did I say that you don't tip in this place?  Yeah, but the service exists.  It may be slow because the person who took your order will be the very same person who serves you.  You can help yourself with water and tea on the condiment table.  3) the people are SO nice: it was the husband today, but the wife is so also cool.  My hubby did the takeout orders with them twice before.4) free wifi that actually works: the password was underneath the cash register, so pull out your I-pad and start yelping while you eat.5) delicious home-style Korean food: don't expect anything fancy, but the stuff they cooked comes from their love for customers.  yummy that is.  I usually stick with the dumpling rice-cake soup combo.  By the way, if you have any question, don't be shy to ask because the owners always patiently answer any question you have.  6) ask more rice if you want!7) there's a plenty of magazines for you to peruse.8) the entire place is very clean.  9) cheap: the entire bill came to under $15 for two (2) meal combo and one (1) can of melon milkis.  10) the ambiance is relaxing and comfortable.  P.S. They did politely to ask you to put away your dishes and trays.  Do so since you didn't tip.  Well-deserved five (5) stars.  If you live in Albany Park, you should try it out.  I wouldn't recommend you to go out your way to come here because it's meant to be a neighborhood restaurant that exists for your convenience.  They now serve home-made bubble teas."
"This restaurant is very cute. The walls are decorated by what appear to be self-painted pictures of water lilies. The couple that owns the restaurant is so sweet and funny. I got the Korean spicy wings. They were spicy yet mildly sweet, with a crispy but moist exterior. SO GOOD. I was having a day out in Albany Park (pretty far from where I live) with friends and we had just pigged out on a giant tray of sushi from lawrence fish market three hours earlier, and so I was essentially full before I even took a bite! (Don't judge.) I literally ate one wing and brought the rest home. They lost their crispy exterior but the flavor was still amazing. Mm!The hot milk tea is DELICIOUS. I promise that you won't regret ordering it."
It was ok.Not as great as I expected from the reviews.They were friendly. It was clean.
"I'm so hooked. Lately I have been addicted to their bibimbap as it's just so delicious!  I rarely eat fried food but I've tried their popcorn chicken and it's really good, not to mention their dipping sauces are unique and full of flavor.Have to try their chicken wings and peanut butter smoothie as other Yelpers have said such amazing things about them. Will post an update as soon as I am able to venture away from the bibimbap!"
"My bud and I dropped by the awkwardly-named Cafe Orient 33 on a Friday evening for dinner.  I was initially stunned that I was able to drag him to this place, as he has had a longtime aversion to Korean food ever since he had a school roommate who ate a lot of kimchi.  I told him that as long as he stayed away from ordering any kimchi, he should be fine, and indeed we both enjoyed our dinner here.  It is unassumingly located within a strip mall on Kedzie, a street famous for its collection of Middle Eastern restaurants and establishments.  The pleasant interior of Cafe Orient 33 is simply decorated.  You place your order at the counter and the food is then brought out to you.  There is a station where you can pour your own cups of hot corn tea and cold water.  Smoothies and bubble teas are apparently popular here.I ordered the beef bulgogi, which comes with a side of white rice and a small cup of kimchi.  The tangy marinated beef was good but not great, and the kimchi was not too spicy so my bud was not put off by the smell of it.  I also ordered the sweet and spicy wings, with five large chicken wing sections in a serving.  The wings were yummy, not too sweet and not too spicy, with a bit of a crunch.  I would love to come back and taste these wings again sometime.  The wings also came with a few carrot and celery sticks, and our server brought out a container of ranch sauce for them.  My bud ordered the chicken with broccoli and other vegetables, a dish which is probably more Chinese or Japanese style rather than Korean.  The chicken and broccoli came with white rice (he passed on the complimentary kimchi), and he added on a side dish of bean sprouts, all of which he liked very much.  My food came out first, so I was killing a bit of time by looking at photos freshly taken by my bud on a recent vacation.  In a cutesy moment, our server gently admonished me in a motherly way that I should eat my food before it gets cold!  Good non-threatening Korean food and good advice are both pleasantly served up at Cafe Orient 33."
"I've dined here a few times so far.  I believe it's owned & run by an older Korean couple, who are very friendly, sweet, kind, respectful, and always smiling!  You can typically expect terrible customer service from most chinese/korean restaurants... so you'll be taken aback by the welcoming & inviting hospitality of this place!The place is a storefront in a little strip mall.  Extremely clean... tables, floors, washrooms.  Although they serve & bring the food to you at your table when it's ready... they refuse to take any tip money.  I've tried, and they won't let you.  They do have a designated table in the restaurant, to  help yourself to cold water / hot tea / condiments.  Also, after you're done eating, you clean your own table (not necessarily clean & wipe down the table... but bring your empty dishes to a bin & throw paper cups in the garbage).The food is very good & has a home-cooked feel to it.  If you're a soup lover... they have ramen noodles (spicy & mild versions).  But I'd recommend their dumpling soup (chicken broth with small gyoza/pot-sticker dumplings & eggs) if you haven't tried it... amazing!  For appetizers... I've tried the fried calamari, deep fried shrimps, bean sprouts sauteed in garlic, house salad.  Entrees... I've tried the bibimbap, chicken teriyaki, egg beef noodle, ny strip steak & onions w/ fried rice.  All food are decent portions... tasty & satisfying.  Kalbi is always good, so haven't bothered to order that yet.  Still have yet to try their salmon teriyaki... looks delicious!Overall.. always a good dining experience when you go here.  It's not exactly ""to die for"" food... but if you're looking to grab a convenient, very good-tasting meal in a clean storefront restaurant w/ a casual setting, this is definitely a nice stop!"
"My man wanted some gyro, again, but I persuaded him to try something a little healthier :) We got some bi bim bop with beef and some spicy korean wings out of here last night. The bi bim bop was sooo good - you just feel good after eating it with some kim chee - yum! As other have said, the wings are absolutely heavenly - like probably the best wings I've ever had. They also give you complimentary tea while you wait - I think genmaicha - brown rice tea - nutty and savory - so yummy.The service was also pleasant and friendly and the restaurant was clean. Free wi-fi as well!Can't wait to try the smoothies/shakes others have posted. I'm very lucky to have this nearby.Do your body and soul good and go here!!"
Chicken is what you come for. The garlic chicken was nice and crispy when it came out. I recommend eating there for maximum freshness. Dining area is large and can accommodate larger parties. The owners are nice and friendly and very inviting. Chicken is da bomb!
"I went here on a whim and never lived to regret it. The food and price were stellar. Delicious eats for cheap ! For such a small place they have quite a selection, plenty to choose from on drinks as well."
"I come here all the time. Great food, low prices make this place good. What makes it great are the staff. They treat you like family! Thanks to Kelly and Ed for always making every experience outstanding. Love your Bulgogi, pork broth soup, and bim bim bop!"
We love coming to this place. It's like being in the home of a Korean family and they're making you fresh delicious food in their kitchen. And the price is unbeatable!  The place is always meticulously clean and welcoming. We adore all the decoration details too. As well as the great periodical selections. We enjoy our relaxing meals here so much that we drive from Logan Square to eat here every chance we get. Love it!!! Can't find a place like this anywhere else in Chicago.
"Second trip, 11/23, and it was just as fantastic this time as the last.  The wife seemed to be working the counter today, and she was just as friendly and helpful as the dude was last time.  For the record, this time the three of us ordered (besides enough food for 5), 15 wings (half spicy Korean, half sweet garlic), 2 Korean BBQ pork sandwiches, 2 bowls of bibim noodles, an order of the fried potato balls, and 3 sodas.  That whole meal came out to 49 bucks and some change.  This place is seriously inexpensive.The Korean BBQ Pork sandwich here is utterly perfect, as are the wings.  Both flavors we tried are seriously recommended, especially the sweet garlic if you're a garlic maniac...huuuuge chunks of garlic stuck to the wings.  It's a garlic lovers wet dream.  The Korean BBQ Pork sandwich has just enough heat to start creeping up on you, and with perfectly cooked glazed pork pieces and kimchi, the flavor is incredible.   The fried potato balls are great...a thin perfect deep fried crunchy outside layer, with a surprising curry-ish flavor on the inside.  Great stuff.  I am also in love with the bibim noodles.  I'm for any dish that comes with a bottle of hot sauce.I'm pretty convinced there's nothing you can get here that isn't just...well, awesome."
"It's a little bit out of the way for me but I wouldn't mind returning if I was nearby. The owners are Korean and they're very nice and sweet. If you can't decide, they will be happy to give you recommendations. As for the food, my order of Bulgogi with rice was rather standard and plain. There was nothing too elaborate or too terrible about the meat so it's a pretty solid 3. Food is brought to your table but you have to bus your trays yourself."
"There is an overwhelming amount of items on the menu. But don't be intimidated. Stick to the basics and you'll be full and happy. Such as,The chicken wings and popcorn chicken. Comes in sweet garlic, louisiana, korean hot spicy. Or the rice plates: bibimbop, bulgogi, pigogi (dwejibulgogi), kalbi, chicken teriyaki."
"Fantastic wings, great bimbimbop"
"Met two of my friends out for dinner here with my wife. The place is a mom and pop place. You order at the counter and bus your own table. They have hot tea and water sitting out for the taking.The food: I believe I got A4 (beef and rice) and A5 (6 different vegetables with an egg) and 10 Korean spicy chicken wings. My friends got the BBQ pork sandwich and the lettuce wrap with bbq short ribs i think. Everything was delicious. Absolutely delicious.The wings: crispy, slightly sweet, slightly tangy, with a spicy heat that was pleasant (it was noticeable, but not overpowering where you stopped being able to taste the food).The beef and rice dish: well spiced and seasoned, flavorful. And very fun sticky rice and a side of spicy kim-chi.Wife's vegetable dish: must have been good because I didn't get a bite...Friends lettuce wrap: also delicious, one bite of meat was slightly tough, but the flavor was nicely complemented by the red sauce and rice that went with it.Didn't get to try the bbq pork sandwich, but it looked delicious.Downside: I probably gained a lb or two from the 10 chicken wings...BYOB, and they supplied nice wine glasses so you didn't have to drink out of plastic cups.Good for easy, casual, good food dinner."
"If you want cheap and delicious Korean food, this is the place to go! They conveniently have a parking lot so parking is not a problem at all. The interior is super clean and nicely decorated. You order and pay at the counter, and then they bring the food out for you. There are a lot of tables to pick from. We ordered 4 things. We got the spicy Korean wings, which were 5 for $6 (or 10 for $11, 15 for $15). They were delicious! I'm a big fan of Korean style wings and have been to many places to try them, but these are really good. They're not too spicy, but are still spicy enough. They are crispy, and not soggy with too much sauce. They are a good size too. We also got the squid ($4.25). It was a decent amount of squid, but it wasn't anything too special so we probably wouldn't get it again. We also got the Bulgogi (7) which comes with rice. That was tasty, and the meat was tender. There were a lot of onions too. Finally, I wanted a hot soup since it is (still) so cold outside, so I got the dumpling soup with rice cakes. The broth was amazing. It definitely hit the spot! It came with 6 dumplings inside, as well as a bunch of rice cakes. In total, our whole meal was less than $25, which is a great deal, considering how much food we got. We didn't have any leftovers though.They have a station with complimentary cold water and hot corn tea, which is delicious. Give it a try if you're there! The service is great, and the owners are very nice and helpful. We will be back for sure!"
"I wonder what their name is all about.  I'm not crazy about it.  Cafe Orient.. what does that mean?  Does it have any context to their menu?  I believe the owners are Korean and many of their dishes are Korean cuisine.  I was talking to the counter guy about the menu.  It's all in English and the entrees are spelled out but curiously, it's written out in definition form.  I found it hard to follow.  Don't get me wrong.. I'm an American, born and raised.  I speak standard English and all that but life in Chicago has taught me to order in Korean when dining on K cuisine.  I've gotten so used to it, that when I'm reading it in English it looks foreign.  Isn't that a trip!  I inquired as to whether they have a Korean menu and they did!  So, I ordered off that.  Ha.Look at all of these glowing five stars.  Alike one other reviewer's mention, it's a great idea that needs work.  Some dishes work great and others, well, should get removed from their menu.  Quite like the bul kogi philly cheese sandwich which was pretty gross mainly because it tasted like a microwaved sandwich.  The texture of the bread and cheese, one could discern it was nuked.  Also, it was oily to the touch.  More than I cared for.  The meat was probably flavorful at one time.The one menu item which is clearly what they're good at are the wings.  The flavors are interesting and each are sure to win over someone's tastes in your group.  Korean spicy and sweet garlic are the clear winners.  The sauces aren't too spicy or too sweet.  Just good enough to enjoy.  However, if someone were to tell me that their wings were frozen going into the fryer, I would probably believe them.  The wings we enjoyed the other day were HUGE.  I'm talking GMO and because of that, you're getting the most for your cash.I'm hopeful about the place.  On my visit I got to meet one of the owners randomly.  Nice idea and the restaurant has cute accents which make it a fun environment to bring a group or a friend.  One interior decorating accent that has always captured my interest are ""air plants"".  In their dining area suspended by string they have these  small, globe terrariums or bulb vases.  Currently, they are empty but I wonder if one day they might be filled with something unique.  Till then, maybe I'll be back again to try a more standard Korean entree.  Prices are great and you won't find Korean fare for this fair a price."

We come here every month and we love it. It's a very relaxed environment and great food.
"They have such great good and very wonderful service. Anyone that says otherwise is a just trying to be a jerk. (I read some of the other reviews, and was upset that a guy gave them 2 stars because they didn't have diet sprite--and the other guy was complaining because they don't put ice in their water. If you ask them---they DO have ice. And they will happily and pleasantly give it to you) but those two men are baby, girly men and do not know how to ask for what they need. Or they throw a fit when diet sprite isn't available. Are you from Ohio or something? Moving on.....the food is delicious. Great Korean chicken wings, great chicken terriyaki, great sautéed veggies--asparagus & mushrooms. They have this interesting fried rice that is great. It has egg & beef sausage....but it's different from any other place. I cannot express how sweet and nice the owner is.....the service is so sweet and personable from her. She makes you feel welcomed and at home. I love her. It is clean, pleasant and an absolute Korean/Asian treasure in the Albany park neighborhood."
"I suggested my siblings and I go here since it has five stars. I almost regret it when I entered because I noticed the meals by the register don't have names on them. I was thinking how would I know what those foods are since I'm not Korean and I only know Bulgogi. Good thing the lady, who I believe is the owner, was so nice to us. She asked us first if it was our first time and when we said yes, she suggested popular foods from the menu and also explained what some of the foods are. She was so helpful and nice.We ordered chicken wings, half korean spicy (SO GOOD!!!) and the other half was Sweet Garlic. Sweet Garlic was good too, but the Korean Spicy was perfect for me. I loved the Chicken Teriyaki that my brother ordered and my Bulgogi. Best thing I had was the banana and peanut butter smoothie. I am not a fan of peanut butter, but when I read from a review here that it's a must, I said why the hell not. No regrets because it became an instant favorite! Did I mention everything on the menu is under $10? Yup. Affordable, delicious food!Will definitely go back here!"
"I LOVE this place!  It's so adorable and the folks working there are super friendly.  I've only tried a few dishes (chicken teryaki, bulgogi, a few appetizers, and wings).  All have been splendid, minus the egg rolls which were so-so.  The wings (especially the sweet garlic) are very flavorful.  You really do get a lot for the price (chicken teryaki and bulgogi are between $6-$7!) The restaurant itself is super clean and adorable, which really stands out in this neighborhood.  The lady who I often see working there (perhaps an owner?) is beyond friendly - one time she brought me a slice of watermelon to munch on while waiting for my carryout order...I don't think you see that kind of service at most places.  I'm fortunate to live two blocks away and come here way more than I'd like to admit."
"Have only been here once (so far!), but the wings and service were definitely on point.  Both the Sweet Garlic and the Spicy Korean wings were very tasty and really big/meaty (I was really hungry, but ended up quite full after eating just 10 wing segments). plus they were friendly and seemed totally cool with me walking in ~3 mins before closing time (which i didn't realize until i got to the door) and then ordering something that would take ~15 mins to cook -- and the owner(?) even gave me a piece of cake while i waiting for my carryout order to be cooked.  The restaurant is in a fairly nondescript strip mall, but the interior seemed nice/clean/comfortable, and parking in the strip mall lot was easy. Will definitely be back."
"My friend and I ordered from Cafe Orient 33 for the first time this week.  Everything was wonderful - tasty, fresh, and reasonably priced.  We ordered dumpling soup with kimchi, garlic chicken wings with nutty coating. asparagus and mushroom stir fry, popcorn chicken with spicy sauce, octopus with onion and hot pepper, and white rice.  All the food was flavorful, and if they said spicy, believe them!  I am looking forward to bringing my family back here - they loved the leftovers, esp. the wings.  FYI, the Yelp listing says delivery is available, but the delivery radius is only 3 blocks.  Plan to pick it up yourself or dine in.  Look for the menu online, but don't forget to look at the ""New Items Added to Our Menu"" tab in addition to the ""Meals"" and ""Side Dishes"" tab cafeorient33.com/home/ne…"
"I live right around the corner from here, and I'm glad I do!The wings, the wings, the wings..Perfect..I had 5 spicy Korean and 5 sweet garlic per the owners recommendation and these things crispy and flavorful. They had the right amount of heat and sweet..Also got the kids some popcorn chicken w/ sweet dipping sauce, they loved it.Got the ramen noodles, which are super inexpensive and pretty good, I mean its ramen so it's never going to be mind blowing. I wrote this place off as just another store front restaurant that probably wouldn't be there for long(like most the other restaurants in that strip), that won't be the case with this spot!"
"My husband and i ate here today and we really enjoyed the food.. We ordered bibimbap, bulgogi and korean wings.. Everything was so yummy.. This will be our go to place if we want our korean food fix.. The owner.. I think he is the owner is super nice.. And the restaurant is really clean.. Definitely coming back here again"
"Was there about a months ago.Looks: It is in a old strip mall that used to be all Koreans years ago. Outside is nothing to show, but it was very clean and nice when I walked in.Service: Very nice people. They are not just business nice, but appears to be very nice people in general. Food: I am a fan of ice water when it comes to drinks. This was the biggest turn off for me. Their water, which is self-service, is almost warm. Not hot, not cold... warm. I tried all three kinds of wings they have. It seems that ingridients are fresh, and everything is made to order. They were crispy outside and juicy inside. But, they were all salty in my taste."
