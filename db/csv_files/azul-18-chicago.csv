Azul 18
"Having returned from a long vacation in the Greek Islands, where there is absolutely NO MEXICAN FOOD to be found........ANYWHERE, I turned to Yelp! once again to find a new place that my wife and I would enjoy given we are very particular in taste when it comes to latin food. After looking at the pics we decided to visit this joint and I must say it was every bit as good as we hoped for! Not only are the chilaquiles excellent in flavor, the tortilla chips are fresh (big plus), but the salsa verde de tomatillo is just as AWESOME, I ordered two extra small bowls of it btw, the house chorizo is very tasty and not overwhelming in spice and to top it off as a center plate the Home Made Beignets made for a nice mushy sweet treat to end the meal.The service was equally pleasant and the price was very decent and well worth it. Thank you very much Azul 18, for this experience could've gone riot wrong given my suppressed appetite for a good latin cuisine meal overseas!! WE WILL BE BACK."
"The service is great here; our host kept our drinks filled and was very on point with everything. The food, well, it's not that great. I've been here for breakfast before and was disappointed. The items on the menu are of the Nuevo Latino type--and it's a BYOB establishment.My brother ordered quesadillas as an appetizer/meal since he wasn't very hungry. The plate did not look very good and he said it was alright.I ordered fish tacos and they apparently came with sweet potato fries. The tortillas were stiff in some parts, and soft in others where my tacos just started falling apart. The flavor was great though, which helped eclipse the disappointment of  stiff/breaking tortillas. Each taco (3) contained a filet, covered in a flavorful sauce/coleslaw-type mix. The combination of flavors was really nice--neither the sauce nor slaw mix was overwhelming. The sweet potato fries though, they were odd. The flavor was ok, but the serving looked like they were just bottom-of-the-bag leftovers from wherever they came.I'm a bit iffy about returning to this place at this point. If you have other recommendations, please feel free to message me. I'm all for supporting local businesses, but the food needs to be good enough that I'll want to return."
"After a several visits now, this has become our go to breakfast spot! Great coffee, delicious bacon, and yummy fruit smoothies. Never crowded, we've always gotten a seat quickly. Only thing is the service. While they are very nice, every time we've gone our waiter doesn't write down our order and so every time we have to ask for it again or he comes back to ask again. Forgetting how I wanted my eggs, bringing sausage instead of bacon, our fruit smoothie never showed up once, you get the idea.  Having been a waitress for many years back in the day, I'm pretty understanding of how hectic it can be, so we didn't make a big stink about it. And having been a waitress I also know that a lot of people may not be so understanding (especially about a bacon fail!) so I strongly suggest they start writing orders down! No more bacon fails!"
"Honestly maybe it was what we ordered, but after reading some of the reviews, this place is either a hit or miss on service and food. During our experience, the service was definitely on point, but the food was nothing to rave over. It was honestly just mediocre. Time: 1030-11am on SaturdayService: Friendly and pretty attentive. My coffee was consistently full.Food: Disappointing and mediocre. We got:- Azul 18 breakfast and asked for the eggs to be over easy, but half the eggs were overcooked. Dry biscuit and just regular bacon and sausage.- Special of the day: Apple and walnut challah french toast. The constancy of the bread was off. Some slices were thick than others which causes the batter to soak differently so the thick pieces was pretty much just bread whereas the thinner pieces were actually french toast. I figured the special was the way to go, but sadly it wasn't the case. It just seemed like their specials meant they needed to get rid of inventory aka the walnuts because they were super stale.Overall Pilsen is diverse and upcoming area that I have yet to fully explore. This place gives the area variety and I probably need come back and get what others are raving about because my first time experience was a miss."
Came here for a late breakfast.Chilaquiles - My guy got this and thought it was pretty good. He liked that they added the sour cream. Fish Tacos - I thought these were fresh and good. Would come back to try other items.
"Spacious and clean, friendly service albeit a little slow for the amt of ppl there. The spicy omelette was delicious! Abundant and crispy pork belly with radish and cilantro, which worked well. Tad salty though. Fried potatoes were solid. Beignets were REALLY GOOD. Fluffy and chewy soft inside, little crunch on the outside. Perfect with a cup of black intelligencia coffee. Will be back!"
"As I was looking for quick bite near work, I stumbled upon this place. It's looked like a nice, clean brunch place with tons of breakfast-y options but I was in a hurry so I ordered the flautas. They were the most unique flautas I've had -- dry meat wrapped in toasted shell topped with greens and salads. As I was full I enjoyed my meal for $10 but I'm not sure if I'll be back for lunch again. Looking at the other reviews, I know I'll be back for some chilaquiles!"
"One of the fancier, cleaner and newer places in the Pilsen neighborhood. My son and I came here on a Sunday for brunch and ordered the Steak and Eggs and Chilaquiles. Chilaquiles was awesome but I thought the Steak and Eggs lacked flavor.BYOB- I saw others bringing in champagne.Service- The gentleman that was serving us was nice but he was the only one serving so service might be backed up if it was any busier."
"Happy to see a normal restaurant occupy a good spot on this block with Beurrage bakery and across the street from Thalia Hall and Honky Tonk BBQ. This is not a gastropub, not a new concept, not a make advance reservations, not a grass fed beef, not an all ingredients sources within 50 miles, not a must try restaurant. Just a nice low key restaurant for regular folks to have eggs and coffee on Saturday morning. And hopefully at my next visit, some dinner. We had beignets, huevos rancheros and lobster house Benedict with coffee. $24.  All were good and we will come back again soon. The menu is a mix of American and Mexican flavor dishes. They were called International Grill a couple of months ago, same owner but they changed Chefs."
"The chilaquiles w/ eggs, turkey chorizo, avocado, sour cream are delicious! The service was equally as great, our server came to refill the water & to check on us quite a few times. The atmosphere is relaxing and inviting. They take care of their appearance and the restaurant looks awesome. Plus they have intelligentsia coffee, major plus! A great Pilsen gem."
"Great food, great service, great place! Ordered the chicken tortilla soup and lobster benedict and banana with granola milkshake! Owner very nice and excellent service!!"
Beignets.  Lobster Benedict.  Pulled Pork Hash.  Spicy Omelette.  In that order.  And the kind and highly servicing owner Jose will make you feel at home.  DO IT!
Pleasantly surprised.  The eggs benedict with smoked salmon was egg-cellent.  Eggs and hollandaise sauce perfectly executed.   The potatoes - I believe were reds deep fried were crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.  My friend had the chicken tortilla soup and he loved wi along with his eggs.  The rest of the menu is VERY reasonably priced for the type of food they serve.  Jose Cruz one of the owners sat and chatted with us.  It's BYOB and they have mussels for $7. Shhh---it's a secret!
"Hidden gem! Just had dinner here tonight and it was really great, couldn't believe there were only a few tables taken. We usually just do brunch takeout here (which is always great) and we realized they are open a few nights for dinner so gave it a try. We had the shrimp Diablo and the panko crusted chicken and both were so flavorful! Service was very nice and presentation was top notch. We will definitely be back. Menu is very inventive and so reasonable.  Give it a try!"
"Walking in the atmosphere was very welcoming.The music was great :) It was four including myself who came in for breakfast on a Sunday it was great seating,no wait at all.Our server was great;very polite.We ordered our drinks before hand I first decided to go with the 'life juice'but our server kindly recommend their special of the day which was 'strawberry and orange'juice perfect change of choice!ordereding the  ham & cheese crepe for myself.my friends ordered the smore french toast , steak benedict and azul 18 plate...everything was delicious! I will definitely be coming back. Oh almost forgot it's BYOB ;)"
Very hearty comfort food. I had an amazing breakfast which included the banana and granola smoothie and Huevos Rancheros with the tomatillo sauce. I am certainly adding this place to my list of favorite to go places.  My guest had the Chilaquiles and was blown away. A really reasonable pricing and down to earth staff.
"Disappointed with the service AND the food. The food wait was way too long, and the food was mediocre, perhaps if it was very yummy I would still go back. My little fam bam ordered a kids pancake (comes with juice) with a side of sausage for my son, a Pilsen waffle for me (strawberries, bananas, vanilla ice cream, and chocolate drizzle), huevos rancheros for the hubby, and an oatmeal and bananas so we could get to eating asap. The waffle was okay, honestly I've had better (at Cornerstone on Western/Elston, at IHOP on Diversey), my son's pancake and sausage was fine- he didn't complain, and my hubby's huevos rancheros were a little under seasoned but okay. We paid $40 for a meal we waited close to 50 min for, when there was no big crowd, and that's just not okay with me. I will stick to my favorite, Cornerstone (seriously try the Delightful crepes with Nutella, strawberries, bananas and walnuts), or will accept my aunt's Mexican homemade cooking for free. I was there Iast Sunday at 10am (Palm Sunday) and there was no wait, so I went in with my son as my hubby parked and we were seated quickly. (Parking is hard.) The hostess was welcoming, and served us water. The waiter came after 15 min, and so we ordered. Our drinks and my coffee came about 10 min later. 15 more min passed and the oatmeal we wanted first wasn't done yet, bummer. Quickly I noticed that the two gentlemen seated next to us, who arrived 10 min after my hubby and I ordered were being served their brunch; now I was lit. I asked the server if the oatmeal was coming up and 5 min later he came back with it. By now we had been waiting for about 40 min and my son was asking me for his pancake. The wait ended 5 min later and we were all finally eating."
The steak and eggs were delightfully delicious. The larger than advertised steak was surprisingly well seasoned and tender. The guacamole portion was small but tasty and the fried beans were swapped out for a small salad with a crisp taste. 10/10 would order it again.
"This is my new brunch spot.  I had the steak salad for $10.50.  For sure a good deal.  It was light, filling and very flavorful.  I also had the Azul traditional full breakfast with eggs, sausage and potatoes and it was average.  I suppose with eggs over easy it's pretty standard thus I'm not sure how I could be better.  However I was hoping the potatoes that went with it would be a little bit more salty.  The fresh kale juice was light and refreshing.  It could use s little bit more kale though.  Overall, nice brunch spot in Pilsen!"
"Here is the thing..A couple days ago, me & hubby were walking around Pilsen when we noticed this new spot, so since we were felling adventurous we decided to give it a try: The Service was right on point, Jose Cruz took care of us in a marvelous way, he was attentive without being annoying,  and I really appreciate that when I go out..The food was also amazing, and I have to admit that I like the fact that our food came out in a decent amount of time, my husband had the fish tacos, my son had the french toast and I had the beef burger,  and I have cero complaints about the food,nice flavor with a nice presentation. For what I noticed seems like a good restaurants for groups also, oh, and for kids!! Our server mentioned that initially they were open only for brunch but they are also going to be open for dinner starting on October 16.So guys, I do believe this new spot deserves a try! Im totally coming back to see what they will be offering for dinner, you never know if this will be the ""Pilsen Hidden Gem"""
"Deliciously fresh omelet with the ability to substitute fresh fruit or a salad for the potatoes, major win. The chilaquiles were excellent and they kept the coffee cup full. You won't be disappointed dining at this Pilsen gem."
"One of the best breakfast places my boyfriend and I have ever been to! The beignets were great; they were warm and came with raspberry and Nutella dipping sauces. We split the chilaquiles, and it was phenomenal! Everyone should order it. We also ordered the fresh juices and split the cloud crepe, which were all very good. Overall, a great out-of-the-way find that everyone should visit!"
Food was superb !! the owner was so warm and friendly . I had the salmon with a lobster sauce and it came with zucchini . It was amazing . The dishes has amazing  unique flavors.. Must try restaurant . I will   be back !
"If I lived in the neighborhood of be a frequent diner. Good food and reasonably priced.Highly recommend the steak salad (amazing meat and beautifully presented), beignets (perfectly done and served with Nutella and homemade raspberry sauce), and chicken sausage (it's insanely good).Staff were really nice too."
"Very tasty food,the service was very good,the only complaint was slow for bring our food,definitely I recommend this place!"
"The food is really good here!  We order take out and dine in frequently.  Chilaquiles are so good and I love the house potatoes!  It's a good deal for the quality of food that they serve.Only criticism is that service can be a bit slow sometimes.  As long as you are not in a rush, the food is totally worth the wait."
"Nice servers, but brunch burrito with turkey chorizo was bland and had a bad after taste.  I ordered a side of fruit and they brought potatoes. The potatoes were deep fried and large. My sister ordered a biscuit and it was stiff and tasted microwaved and for some reason was greasy. They receive 3 stars for kind servers, allowing BYOB, family friendly, and no wait for seating."
"This is a great brunch addition to the block. I've visited a handful of times and each dish I or my guests have had did not disappoint! My favorites so far are the pork belly hash and the chilaquiles. If you're in the mood for pancakes, they have those too. Also on the menu are fresh juices - carrot/orange does it for me. Friendly staff, quick service. Definitely recommended."
This place was recommended and when I read the reviews all the feed back was positive so we decided to stop by for breakfast. The Chilaquiles and Torta Cubana were so delicious and good portions.  We had to end our pleasant visit with the Waffles!!!Excellent Customer Service!
Second time here this place is really good. Everything I had was perfect.. Was annoyed by the girl next to me complaining about the lobster Benedict saying the chunks of lobster were not big enough blah blah blah lobster isn't in season and why would you order it in the Midwest if your expecting what your expecting.. Again I say this place is good chilaquiles are amazing I recommend getting that if you're undecided.
Had the fish tacos and they were amazing.  Fish was crispy and tender.  Our table also orders the black bean burger and special request vegan fajitas.  Everyone was happy and we will be back again!
Great service and food. Salad was fresh and filling. Tacos the sauce was ok. There is plenty of meter parking. Bathrooms clean.
I really loved the food and the service at this place and that's the main reason I gave it so many starts. It's rather quiet during the week although it's an awesome restaurant located in the Pilsen area. A neighborhood going through gentrification.  Their cuppachino's are great and the Lobster hollandaise with poached eggs was super!! Their red velvet pancakes are also yummy!!!
Bought a Groupon for lunch.  NO where on the Groupon did it specify you can only use the Groupon Tuesdays through Friday from 9-3 p.m.  So I go there today on a Saturday at 11:30 a.m. and the waiter tells me I cant use it!  WTF!  I explained that it does not specify what day you can use it and he still refused!  I really wanted to try this place out but customer service sucks!   At least Groupon gave me my money back!
Excellent meal and service! Four of us came for brunch and all of us loved our meals. Fresh ingredients and hearty portions. Can't wait to come back and try more things on the menu!
"Best breakfast/brunch in Pilsen and maybe Chicago! And so reasonably priced. The chilaquiles are to DIE for. Their specials are always unique and delicious, including the blueberry cream cheese stuffed french toast. They also make these gorgeous fruit bowls out of grapefruits and add yogurt and granola. It's so good. The staff is so friendly as well, I always love going in there. Next time I'm bringing champagne to add to their delicious fresh squeezed OJ!"
Food took forever & it was just O-K...to top if off owner would not accept my Groupon which brought me here ...due to a clerical supposedly on Groupon... It was meant for Monday thru Friday not on weekend.... It was not stated on the Groupon. He was nice but dismissive ...not a good way to have a new customer go back especially after I ended up paying $65 for a crappy lunch for 4....if food was great was great wouldn't have cared!
"This place is a gem. Fantastic food, great service, and shockingly low prices. They offer interesting twists on both US classics (like the delightful croquet Benedict) and Mexican fare. It's worth going far out of your way to eat here."
Wonderful Mediterranean BYOB restaurant across from Thalia Hall in Pilsen. I want to return and try more. Nancy O
"Tried this out for the first time since I saw they had good reviews. The service was good and the waitress even helped us decide what to order in which she did not disappoint. The chilaquiles were delicious; the turkey chorizo, sour cream and guacamole were an added bonus! Their freshly squeezed orange juice was awesome as well! Already planning to go back sometime this week to try other things on their menu. It's also byob so don't forget to bring some champagne to make mimosas! ;)"
