Cafe Urbano
"An Irving Park gem! The neighborhood needs more cozy and hip spots like this.The coffee was exceptional and well brewed, teetering on bold and dark versus watered down is just my style.We also had the breakfast wrap which I would describe as a healthier morning treat complete with a morning side salad.Try their muffins too.Atmosphere was clean and cafe-esque, definitely catering to a hipper, refined yet down to Earth crowd that you won't find at Dunkin' doughnuts or even Starbucks. Great spot! We will be back soon."
"Pros: Food was a solid 5 stars. I had the Cajun Turk panini and it was phenomenal. Their fruit salad was huge and contained strawberries, blackberries, bananas, oranges and apples. The space itself was cute, pretty hipster, which is fine by me. The biggest plus is that it's a 5 minute walk from my house and the prices are great for what you get. I'm excited to go back and try some coffee.Cons: The entire bakery case if from Costco (confirmed by the girl behind the counter). This bums me out because there are so many local bakeries they can partner with to fill their case. Also, we had lunch there on a hot day and the place was ROASTING inside. No AC was blowing, which made it uncomfortable. Luckily we had layers on, so we made it work by stripping down. Service was pretty slow, but once I tasted the food, I did not mind one bit.I will definitely be back. I hope they consider getting baked goods from an actual bakery or making them in house because who doesn't enjoy a delightful pastry with their coffee?"
"Passed by this area and saw the sign. My husband and I were hungry and wanted to try the place out. First I really like the look of the cafe. It reminded me of Pilsen mixed in with some Island life look (reminded me of a cafe in Kauai HI last time I was there).  I was really digging the look of the place. Local art hanging around and I saw on their calendar that they have a yoga night too. How awesome is that?!Food: I ordered the breakfast burrito which was eggs, chipotle gouda, avocado, and tomato in a tortilla wrap, then grilled panini style. Very tasty and filling. yum. Washed it down with a sweetened Cafe con Leche which was solid. Would have liked it a bit stronger but maybe Ill just get a shot of espresso as a topper. It came with a little side salad that was perfect! great combo and for the price? you can't beat it.  The guy at the front was nice, welcoming and I like that! non pretentious atmosphere that serves solid food and java with local art that I can appreciate. Will visit there again."
Super good spanish American fusion place. Try any of the paninis or soups. I had the tuna sandwich with a special order of a fried egg. Then had the albondiga (meatball) soap that reminded me of my moms soup when I was a kid. Very good and tasty. Add a good cup of expresso coffee and it's heaven. Must try.
"It's a much-needed addition to the Irving Park/Albany Park neighborhoods.I finally got the chance to check it out, and I wasn't disappointed.  They serve the red eye coffee!  Do you know the magic of a cup of red eye coffee?  It's the best coffee to keep my stamina up the entire day.  The best thing is that they serve it, either in a 12oz. or 16oz. cup.  Their red eye coffee is definitely on point.  In addition to a variety of coffee and drinks they offer, they have made-to-order sandwiches, too.  However, be mindful that it will be an additional ten (10) minute-wait.  If you're in a hurry, I'm assuming that you can call a head of time and pick it up onsite.  By the way, their red eye coffee is reasonably-prices.  For $2.50, you can have a 12oz. cup.  A side salad comes with my roast beef sandwich.  Everything was delicious and I had no complaint.  It's a well-lit, tastefully-decorated coffee shop with friendly people.  I could feel that they are passionate about what they do and were very kind to answer my questions.  It's located diagonally across from the Tony's supermarket.  The exact location is the corner building on Elston and Avers.  Fortunately, I live approximately ten (10) minutes away from this place.  I will certainly continue to patronize it and show my biggest support to this newly-established local business."
"This place was very nice. To be honest I have drove several times there and never saw it, but thank god for Yelp. I was looking for coffee place near my house and found Cafe Urbano very close of me. When I got to the place I was impressed of how nice it was and it was actually pretty big this coffee shop. Place has a lot of arts in their walls and look like kinda hipsters kinda place. I love visiting coffee shops and  for sure will stop more often there in this one."
"Beautiful place. They just open and I am so glad. Besides *Bucks there is no coffee shop  close to me. They serve FOOD tooooo not only cofee or tea! Welcome to our neighborhood, CAFE URBANO! I like u so far :) thanks For making me a great Americano!P"
"Yum! Very friendly, welcoming place and delicious, simple and straightforward food! Great drinks, sandwiches, fruit salad, dessert, and service!"
Great little independent cafe with super nice ownership and staff. Tasty food and coffee drinks and they have special events from time to time.
Home style atmosphere today great chill out for my wife and I and our 3 yr old. There are plenty of friendly people to talk with and the smoothies are bombastic!
"What a great addition to the neighborhood. We've been waiting for a place like this! Great coffee, nice vibe and tasty sandwiches. I recommend the 'Twisted Chicken' yum. Or basically anything with the chipotle Gouda in!Nice decor, local art on the wall and for sale as well as free wifi. I hope this place does well and continues to get people through the door, in the culinary/social desert that is this part of town! We'll certainly be going back."
"Can't say enough about this place. Delicious food, great service and very nice atmosphere. Definitely better than Charbucks. Very glad these folks are in business!"
"veggie panini was awesome! it was a mix of veggies and some berries (strawberry, blackberry and blueberry) in the sandwich, nothing I've had before and I loved it!! delicious drip coffee and nice staff. I'll be going back for sure.They also offer a coffee punch card, buy 10 get 1 free. I'm a huge fan of punch cards. I love getting rewarded for having good taste."
I love the Breakfast Burrito. Ask for Cholula hot sauce to put on it. They keep the bottle behind the counter.  The artwork and music is splendid and the staff is friendly and hip.  Wednesdays they have yoga.  Cool place.
"This cafe is exactly what this neighborhood needed!  They keep saying this is their ""soft opening"" so they are still solidifying their menu etc, but so far it's really great.  The Abuelita Mocha is just different enough and not overbearingly sweet that I like it (and I'm a black coffee girl.)The Burrito Panini is AWESOME and comes with the best little salad.The Tuna Salad Tostada seems a little crazy, but try it anyway... It's surprisingly tasty.The music is always good and dang is that place cute on the inside!Bonus- the guys who run this place are super friendly and pretty cool people."
"I love this new neighborhood joint! This is the first place I went to after I got over the stomach flu (TMI? I think not). This place has a good vibe and the employees are friendly and helpful. They were quick to offer suggestions for foods and drinks.I ordered the burrito panini. It tasted fresh and delicious... defintely a good choice for my first meal after getting better! The Mexican hot chocolate was a treat. It warmed me up in this frigid weather. Don't hesitate to ask the employees if you can't decide between two items,  but I'm sure you can't go wrong here!"
"Great little coffee shop that just opened up. The staff was friendly and polite. The manager, Gerardo was willing to take time to talk to us and made sure we enjoyed the food.I tried the Turkey Panini and it was great. Perfectly toasted, and crispy. The Turkey was also seasoned with a great flavor. I also had a bottle of coke in a glass, which was a nice touch. After my meal I tried the hot chocolate. It was delicious and had a different flavor than regular packaged hot chocolate.I definitely plan to make this a regular coffee spot"
"Sooooo friggin happy this place exists right in my neighborhood!I call their cappuccino ""crack-accino"" because I have become dependent on it to live on a daily basis. The staff is friendly and fantastic, and their Hawaiian panini is to die for. Thanks guys, you rock!"
"This is a great little coffee shop with so much soul. I love the way it's decorated and they music really sets the vibe. They serve Metropolis coffee and get their pastries fresh from a local bakery. The guy warmed up my pastry for me and I also had a macaroon. They also have good paninis and are community-oriented, which also makes me love this place. They want to support local artists and host events to bring the community together. If you are looking for a coffee shop, or even a quick bite to eat, this place is definitely worth stopping in."
"Coffee by metropolis is good! Breakfast burrito and cubano were delicious. Things that could be greatly improved: woman with the couldn't-care-about-anything attitude (I asked for no tomatoes and seemed to receive extra in my burrito) and the pastries from Costco (really???? With all of the wonderful local bakeries, it is a shame to serve this crap.) Good addition to the neighborhood nonetheless!"
We live in the neighborhood and recently tried the food at Cafe Urbano. I was very impressed. I ordered what I thought would be a simple sandwich and it was absolutely delicious and came with a wonderful side salad. The staff were very nice and the service was great. This is such a great addition to the neighborhood.
"Just wanted to add that the twisted chicken wrap was really tasty. They also had amazing caneles from the French pastry school for awhile, but currently don't offer them. Hopefully they can partner with another good local baker soon."
"This place ROCKS!! I live in the area, so I've seen the place a lot, but never ventured in. While waiting to view a new apartment nearby, I decided to give it a try. It was SO good that I think it helped me decided to sign the lease. After moving in, I think I was there four times before I closed out the first week. The vibe is unique, sandwiches are yummy, pastries are DE-lish, chai lattes/café con leche are highly addictive, and to top it off, the staff is impeccable! ¡QUE rico!"
"This place was aiiite. Got the turkey panini and a roast beef tostada. Thought they were pretty bland. The cafe con leche was decent. I think there's a lot of potential though. Really nice vibes, friendly staff and cool art work. Id still say check em out and support a local business. Stfu though. Peace!"
"Never a disappointment!Oooooooh, the breakfast panini! Yum! Love the salad it comes with, love that they make it fresh and that everything is pretty inexpensive. Sometimes they don't cook things exactly as I need them because of some food allergies/sensitivities but I would say the staff, vibe, CLEANLINESS and overall quality of the food balances that out.  I've tried a few things but I keep coming back to this and most people I come with get this and love it too.This neighborhood needed this quaint cafe so bad, a welcome surprise! Support the local business, go inside and get warm and I can't wait to see how this place runs in the spring and summer! Love the art too..."
"4.5 stars.Cafe Urbano is a cool new arthouse cafe with great service from a friendly staff, decent cafe grub, and a bright and interesting atmosphere.  The local artist's and authors works are displayed throughout.  The wedge-shaped storefront adds to the appeal.  How cool is it, that a local elementary school class wrote a book of short stories!...it's on the northeast book shelf, check it out."
"Fun menu, very good food, nice, casual atmosphere"
"I don't usually write reviews but this place deserves it. I love pretty much everything about it, from the metropolis coffee and espresso they brew to the truly awesome burrito panini and delicious side salad. I've been twice- once for just a latte and once for breakfast and a latte. The music is perfect coffee house music, the guys working are always crazy nice which is a huge plus in comparison to some of the hipster snob baristas at other places, and the decor is sick- lots of interesting art for sale on the walls and just a cool vibe all around.the burrito panini is delicious as one of the other reviewers mentioned, not super heavy and greasy, just beautiful fluffy eggs and fresh flavors. The side salad was a surprise bonus, leafy greens with a nice vinaigrette and diced apples, pears, tomatoes, onions, and peppers. Simple and delicious.I LOVE that they use Eco-friendly cups too! And real plates and silverware- they seem to be earth conscious which is way appreciatedA great mix of clientele coming and going, too- clearly all locals from the neighborhood.I've always come when I have time to hang out but I would note that it's not the one-minute-latte of the big chains so if you're in a real hurry consider yourself warned that you might have to wait a hot second, but it's well worth it for the quality and care!I wanted to keep this gem a secret but I really want them to flourish because they're so great so hopefully people will see all the positive reviews and check the place out for themselves. I would come every day if I could."
"Unique food, great coffee, excellent soundtrack for your chat or work. Just what the neighborhood needed."
Finally a coffee shop that's open to Irving/Albany Park residents! This place is located right on the corner of Avers and Elston so it might be kinda hard for those without cars or bikes to get to. They serve 16 oz cups of Cafe Con Leche for $3 as well as Abuelita Mochas. Interior is nice with pieces of artwork and plants surrounding the walls. They do have wifi and power outlets. They bring the food and coffee to you which is nice. Atmosphere music is your usual Yeah Yeah Yeahs and Feist. Overall a sweet new coffee shop that has a lot of potential.
"This coffee shop is a great addition to the neighborhood! The people who work there seem super nice. They serve Metropolis coffee and their food options and creative, light, and inexpensive. I've had the burrito panini and I agree with other reviewers that the side salad is a really nice surprise- not your typical side salad, but an interesting mix of flavors. The inside is cozy and comfortable. There are tables as well as tall chairs along the window with plenty of outlets and free wifi (just ask for the password). Nice music, cool decor, all around a great place to chat over a cup of coffee or get some work done."
"Yummmm. Only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because of the limited selection of cheese...BUT the Cubano was amazing. The tuna was also yum, but a bit spicy for my taste! Def coming back!"
"I saw Café Urbano had opened through a posting on Every Block so I decided to go try them out and take out. It was Black Friday around 11 am so most people were out shopping or relaxing at home. I was greeted right away and I saw that they had café con leche so I decided to try it out.  I had also read about the burrito Panini which normally I would not get but I felt adventurous. I paid and sat and waited. There was a family of 4 there besides myself.The café con leche was just ok. It tasted watery instead of milky but this is not really a Cuban restaurant. I added sugar and waited for my burrito Panini. The music was retro alternative. Joy Division and a song by a punk band played which was nice since it took me back to my college days. The space is very nice in the corner of the building at Avers and Elston on the south side of the street.I got my food 15 minutes later and it was brought to me while I sat at a table.  The café con leche was also brought to me. The staff was friendly. When I tried the burrito Panini I was very happy. It has fluffy eggs, peppers, wrapped in a tortilla.  It also had a very fresh side salad with light leafy spinach. It tasted very good. The idea I had was that it was going to be heavy but instead it was perfect and very healthy tasting. I recommend Care Urbano and plan to visit again to try their other menu items. I didn't see a menu online but they may be working these things out since it was literally like 3 days open.  Also I'm guessing they will put up some signage as well.This is a welcome addition to my hood which lacks hip breakfast places with good food.  There are some nice breakfast places with good diner food but this is very hip and relaxing. Check them out."
Really great food! The tostadas are beautifully made and delicious. I also negotiated some of friend's egg & ham sandwich and it was also really good; nice bread.Coffee is right on. A cozy corner spot.
"Irving Park could use more places like this. I stopped in to get some work done outside of the house and couldn't be happier! I had a few coffees and a brownie which were both delicious. They also have outlets, wifi, and a nice variety of music. It's pretty sweet. I might even check out yoga wednesdays."
Tasty sandwiches and good coffee.
"Best experience I've had at a neighborhood cafe! The food is definitely the selling point of this place. I ordered the turkey panini which came with a salad, and an Abuelita Mocha. My panini was badass, but I was pretty much drooling at everyone's plates around mine. The decor of the place was awesome. The signage and art on the walls are from Twisted Tattoo right next store. Both of which are the same owner! I've been following the opening process of this place online and I must say I am very pleased. I would recommend and will be returning. If not for the attractive/muscular spaniard with the glasses taking my order, it would be for the awesome customer service they give!SUPPORT YOUR LOCAL BUSINESS!"
"Awesome!  Cute new place in my hood.  Spacious, nice decor, clean, good music, friendly staff.  I'm having the Hawaiian Torta Panini & The Abuelita Mocha.  The sndwch comes w/ a side (mixed greans) salad.  ALL DELICIOUS!  Big portion, stuffed!  The Mocha is like no other I've ever had, I cant pinpoint what it is (must be the chocolate) but I like it.Only complaints...They didn't bring my food to my seat like they said they were going to (no biggie I took the 10 steps) but they did bring food out to another table & they forgot my coffee.  They come out to chk on me, which was nice, which is when I reminded them of the coffee.  I asked for a glass of water, they gave me btld, which they did not charge me for.  They just opened 2 days ago so I think they just need to critique their service. Overall...Awesome!  I will be coming back to try some of their other tasty sounding items."
"It's a shame this place had to be a disappointment.  I've had the tuna, roast beef, and red white and green panini, the albondigas soup, and several drinks off the menu.  All were bland and mediocre at best.  Last time I was in it was over a half hour until I had received my food... Only to find out that my order was filled incorrectly and I had to wait another 10 to get my food.  My panini was cold and hard by the time I was able to eat it, my drink- average.   When I explained that I had to leave as I didn't plan for a 45 minute sandwich take out in my schedule I was told ""yeah well it'll be up in a second""... 10 minutes later... Only reason it gets two stars is the atmosphere is cool and Elston ave really needs a place like this... Hopefully these are mere growing pains as I would love to have a coffee shop I like in that area"
"This place is great! The staff is wonderful, coffee delicious and food unique. They do a great job connecting to the community. The even donated gallons and gallons of their soup for a fundraiser in the neighborhood!"
