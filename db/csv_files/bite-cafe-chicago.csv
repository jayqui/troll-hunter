Bite Cafe
"If you drive too fast on Western Ave, one can easily drive past this small but delectable cafe. It is located on the east side of Western in a very bland, boring building. If Bite Cafe would put some flower pots at their front door, drive bys would notice this restaurant and stop and enjoy their freshly made Breakfast & Dinner items.We arrived at Bite Cafe around lunch hour and were promptly seated. The restaurant offers a contemporary spin on favorite breakfast/brunch entrees. Today I wanted to try comfort food so, I ordered the grilled cheese sandwich with tomato fennel soup.  Yeah, the sandwich arrived with it's crusts cut off, which is how I like my grilled cheese! The sandwich was a little too crispy and could've used another slice of cheese. The tomato soup was thick and tasty. I would've liked some parmesan cheese sprinkled on top.My companions ordered the Pimento Cheese Eggs Benedict served with Arugula and something we've never heard of before: the mashbrown. It was an inch thick circle of fried potatoes and spices, very tasty, could've eaten another one.My other companion ordered the Pork Belly, Egg and Cheese Biscuit. The pork belly was fried nicely, not too fatty and his egg was cooked thru, not runny.The ambience of the cafe is simple: wood tables anchored by turquoise metal chairs offset by a floor to ceiling brick wall.The only downside, the bathroom is located in the kitchen, which is awkward and very small."
"So, understandably they won't seat an incomplete party, and it's a good thing because the girls were quite late!  I love the modern/rustic decor and the huge paned window.  I also love that it's a BYOB and you can walk next door to the Empty Bottle and grab something to drink.  Although there was a large Friday night crowd, service was good and the staff was really friendly.  My meat-eating friends had catfish and udon noodles, and the slow-cooked beef short rib.  They both loved what they had and I'll have to take their word for it.  I had a couple of tofu tacos.  They were ok.  The tofu wasn't very flavorful.  Although tofu is bland by nature, it can take on any flavor that's thrown its way.  I just didn't pick up on much flavor.  There was guacamole on the taco but it was seriously the size of a chocolate chip, so I can't really tell if it was good or not.  There just wasn't enough there.  So the girls decided to get dessert and I was sad that there wasn't a vegan dessert on the menu.  The nice server told me they had an off-menu dairy-free lime sherbet so I gave it a go.  It came with a crumble of crunchy sweet granola which was delicious with the cool, tart sorbet.  Although I wasn't blown away with my tacos, I'd love to come back here and give it another go.  There were enough things really right about this place to merit another visit."
"Can't believe it took me three years to review this place after countless trips and living mere blocks away! Bite is one of the original joints on the new Western Ave. Ukrainian Village revitalization, and it's also one of the strongest. A great option for brunch or dinner - as long as you are able to amply be seated. It is much easier to get seated for dinner (no reservations! heed warning!) Very often I find there to already be a wait; sometimes up to 45 minutes. BYOB is a huge plus, as I've made my own mimosas for brunch and enjoyed beer and wine for dinner. For brunch, both their savory and sweet dishes are absolutely delectable. My recommendations: french toast or any of their hash/scramble selections featuring a plethora of appetizing ingredients that you won't find being used so innovatively in most neighborhood brunch establishments. For dinner, the burger, grilled cheese, and short rib are all great bets. The only problem with Bite is that they sometimes ""bite"" (see what I did there...) off more than they can chew. Their more eclectic offerings, such as pasta, Indian, or Mexican dishes, often fall a bit flat and don't match up to ethnic cuisine restaurants. Although I suppose it's my own fault for being an adventurous eater. Stick to the American comfort food and you'll be amazed."
"Bite is such a great brunch spot! Be sure to get here early on the weekends because this little place sure does get busy. Luckily you can grab a cocktail while you wait in the bar next door. I love to grab a seat by the window! We start off with some coffee and a biscuit with jam. I love places that make their own biscuits and jam as a starter because it makes you feel right at home. Some suggestions for dishes would be the eggs Benedict and really any hash they have, but I'd go with the pork hash if they have it. They are also open for dinner and I've gotten a decent burger from there. However, breakfast is definitely the forte here!"
"Great place for brunch!  Small place, so expect to wait 20-30 minutes.  BYOB, but connected to the empty bottle if you want to pop over before or after for a drink. Pork hash was fantastic. Breakfast poutine was also delicious. Dark Matter coffee is the house coffee. Would definitely recommend for brunch, and we'll be coming back to try dinner."
"This is such a cute restaurant with very reasonable prices. It's quaint and charming. We ordered the escargot pasta and the beef cheeks. I would skip the latter since the flavors are so familiar but the pasta had great flavor. We also got the Belgian waffle with goat cheese ice cream. For $6, now THAT was worth it. It was really crunchy (probably deep fried) but the ice cream was delicious. Probably the best goat cheese ice cream I've had in a while.I also just enjoy the vibe of this play. It's charming and laid back and there's a lot of space for diners. Would come back again!"
"I saw this place featured on Chicago's Best and the food looked delicious. We went around noon on a Sunday and were told it would be a half hour wait. The restaurant is quite small so they have you wait next door...it's not the fancy of places, but at least you're not stuck waiting outside. We were seated in exactly half hour from the time we put our names down. Our waitress was pleasant and my friend and I decided to go the lunch route. I got the veggie burger and my friend got the turkey arugula sandwich. Both of us were disappointed. Maybe it had something to do with the wait versus what the food tasted like. My veggie burger was bland. I was sort of hoping the red sauce on it would be spicy, but it really didn't have a taste. The fries were also quite boring and not seasoned well. I still have high hopes for this place though because after I ordered I sort of knew I should have went the breakfast route. If I do go back I will definitely try the French toast!"
"Going for breakfast on Saturday and Sunday mornings in Chicago can be rather discouraging. Many breakfast spots have long lines outside and crowded waiting areas inside. So, you end up preparing your own breakfast at home. And then you stumble upon Bite Cafe.It could be that I got there as soon as they opened for business because the restaurant did start to fill up later, but not such that patrons had to wait outside for a seat. This was a huge plus.I had the challah bread French toast, mashedbrown, and eggs scrambled well with gruyere cheese. The French toast was so blooming good that it didn't require any more syrup than the maple syrup drizzle that came on it. The hazelnut butter and banana anglaise gave flavour without making the toast excessively sweet. The mashedbrown was a potato cake that I'd buy in bulk and eat in the mornings for a breakfast snack. And since I was able to get gruyere in my eggs rather than American, jack, or cheddar cheese, I was in love.So, it seems that Bite Cafe also has lunch and dinner menus. I shall have to return to check out those offerings. The breakfast set was definitely good enough to have me return in the mornings, for sure."
This is our first visit and we really enjoyed our brunch.The pork and collard green omelette was original and delicious! Our waitress mistakenly ordered an additional and returned it without any issues. Customer service was awesome! We will return with friends.
"Now I rarely come to the Ukrainian village, but I did want to check out the Do Division fest. K recommended Bite and so we went over. The place is smaller than the pics they have up, but its very cute and lively inside. They seat you once your whole party gets there and cos of lack of space, you usually have to eat at the bar or stand outside. They have a number of smaller tables, so really big groups would be hard to accommodate. One of our friends showed up unexpectedly and we squeezed her in on our 2 person table, to be informed that we were making the other guests uncomfortable. Not really cool- the waitress didn't offer us another table or anything. On to the food- now this is the reason to come here. We tried the bi bim bap, the biscuits and spinach, the asparagus omelette and the strawberry bread. I LOVED the first dish, the bulgar was so well made and flavorful, will definitely get this and the strawberry bread again. The omelette and spinach biscuits was ok- well made but ok. The omelette comes with a hash brown patty which is a true melody of textures- I hope to get it on the side without the omelette. I will come back to try the other dishes for sure."
"Bite is great. I've been several times, I'm a big fan of their brunch. I'm warning you now, there's a wait. I usually come during the week to avoid the crowds. It's small, quaint, and quirky. The service has always been good.I'm a big fan of their eggs, the hangover fry is my favorite so far. There's usually something different to try, in addition to a few staples. The menu isn't very big for those of you that are picky eaters, but I do think there's variety. Oh, and the bathroom is in the kitchen, the staff had Fleetwood Mac's greatest hits playing last time I was there.I personally think that their brunch menu is stronger than the dinner menu, but I could eat breakfast for every meal. Good location, usually parking isn't much trouble. Definitely worth checking out!"
"This place was PACKED on a Sunday afternoon, but thankfully we were quickly seated at the bar. Our waitress, a fabulous girl with blue tipped hair whose name I can't recall, was awesomely helpful in guiding us toward food we would love. And man was she right! I had the French toast with hazelnut butter, which was a perfect blend of sweet and savory. The ""mashbrown"" was a fun take on a latke, although probably the most lackluster thing we tried. The pork hash was a hit with the boy, although it wasn't my thing. Great food at reasonable prices - no complaints here!"
Absolutely amazing food. I have been here a couple of times now and I have never left disappointed. The menu changes often. Every time I come in I am delighted to see very creative and unique menu options. The pork hash is absolutely amazing and a regular item on the menu. I had the Pomento Cheese Eggs Benedict this morning and it was delicious. The smells from the kitchen alone are a reason to visit this place. The ingredients are always fresh and nothing is ever stale. Good coffee and amazing food. What else can you ask for?! The server was also kind and very attentive. 5 stars from me and I will be back!
"We decided to try Bite based on the Yelp reviews and were not disappointed. We went for Sunday brunch and ended up sitting at the bar next door, so we didn't have to wait. The service was good and so was the atmosphere. It took a while to get our food and when it came, was a little on the lukewarm side of things. I'm not sure if this was a result of where we were sitting or what, but it's worth mentioning. My Bi Bim Bop was super flavorful and light, exactly what what I was looking for. My husband's breakfast poutine was also very tasty, but he was a bit disappointed that his poached egg arrived hard boiled. I'm excited to try Bite again and I'd love to see what they have in store on the dinner menu!"
"You don't spy breakfast poutine on too many menus here in the good ole USofA. And if I had more space in my midsection I would definitely have sampled said dish at Bite Cafe. But nevertheless I ordered the migas and thoroughly enjoyed my bfast at the adorable Bite Cafe. First of all, the location is pretty choice, as there's a good amount of free or metered street parking within a stone's throw of the cafe. While it's small in size, Bite Cafe's menu is big on flavor. After some perusal I settled on the aforementioned migas - fried tortilla scramble, yukons, pico de gallo, salsa verde, and pepperjack. It was warm cozy, super filling, and delicious. Hat tip to our friendly server who recommended it as I was waffling through options! Next time I'm in the area and craving a substantial, creative bfast, Bite Cafe is near the top of my list!"
"Idk why I haven't been back sooner! Went here to grab my favorite tofu tacos- which were amazing as usual- I also grabbed a side of the seasonal vegetables And so happy i made that choice. I usually go for the fries, but so glad I chose the veggies today! They were so delicious  can't wait to come here again and loveThat they have a veggie & vegan friendly menu! Thanks bite !"
Can I somehow give this place 6 stars?I don't know what I can say that hasn't been said in on of the more than 600 reviews that have been previously posted.AMAZING Food.BYOB.Great service.Did I mention BYOB and Fantastic Food?
"I had some great food while in Chicago, but this was by far the best!We had the escargot pasta and the beef cheeks/scallops. Both were great, especially the escargot pasta. For dessert, we ordered the Belgian waffle with the goat cheese ice cream, which was probably one of the best desserts I've ever had--I'm so glad I split it with my friend, because it was really rich.I loved the intimate vibe of the place. Such a great dinner experience!"
"The husband and I truly like the staff at Bite Cafe and the ambience. The ambience is casual with local artists' work displayed that changes several times a year.  The music varies with the personnel and that is cool.We enjoy getting the breakfast and lunch menu here more than the dinners because the selection of entrees has changed so much. Everything emphasizes red meat or seems to include bacon or cream during dinner and the vegan/vegetarian options usually are heavy on pasta or other carbs, or fried, or otherwise are heavier than we prefer.Breakfast and lunch options (available from 9am to 5pm) are lighter and more appealing to us! The morning bread is big enough to share and a quick bread reflecting seasonal flavors! It's particularly good with the Bite Cafe Blend of Dark Matter coffee, which is only available in a full octane caffeinated version, which I love! The husband doesn't like Bite's inability to prepare his eggs in a soft un-browned version. He limits himself only to soft poached eggs if he orders them at all. He enjoys the soups, except those that feature potato or bacon; the breakfast taco, the black beans (number 3 quality version in Chicago, IMHO), the Bi Bim Bop, and is willing to try new menu items when they appear. I enjoy the breakfast taco made with egg whites, the tofu scramble with black beans instead of the mashbrown and multigrain toast instead of sour dough, the side salad, the seasonal entree salads, and the grilled asparagus or vegetables when available.We like the evening fish dish when it is prepared without cream or bacon. The vegetable sides are usually very good especially when dairy free. The desserts are limited to their after 5 Pm seatings. I like the brownie and give my ice cream to the husband. He usually likes the cake if available.All in all, I highly recommend the Bite Cafe! Usually parking on Western is not a problem."
"According to my husband Bite Cafe deserves a 4.5-5 stars from his point of view.I only gave them 4 stars because we weren't noticed once we walked in at the door (however: they were a bit busy for having just two servers), and we actually sat ourselves in which might throw some people off if you never have been here before. (note: this wasn't my first time here).Kudos to Exec Chef: Dave Cooper & his Sous Chef: Todd Decker. My husband and I decided to tackle items off the special menu board. For some reason I feel this is where the chef/sous chef have more freedom w/creativity in a dish. My husband had the milanesa open face sandwich special, and I had a crazy fresh, clean, lots of heat and favorable tofu scramble special.The end results we both w/clean plates asking for more.;)Thank you Jesy you were sweet, and attentive."
The French toast was good but underwhelming for what I expected. The hangover salad is always good though. The place is small but the hours are nice.
"On a day I wanted to celebrate my birthday brunch, I went on yelp and looked for a spot around the wicker park area. And I am so excited I found this place!!My cousins got here a few minutes before me and there was a 10 minute wait, we were given the opportunity to hang out in the back room (surprised they had this room, but is a great addition) where they had a pool table and a few vintage games. The service was great! Really nice and attentive waitress who gave us her recommendations and helped us set up our BYOB mimosas!I ordered the pork hash (in which 3/5 of us ordered--and all of us agreed is to die for). My cousin got the migas---kinda like a chilaquilles and she finished it! My other cousin figured to order the bi bim bap since the holiday eating has been overwhelming--she was glad she had this choice!Overall nothing I can complain about !!"
"This place is good, inconsistent, but good. The space is small but great for dates. The tables are close together so be aware that'll be close quarters. The kitchen is open to the dining room but not noisy or smokey. The food: We've been there three times and have tried 1) The poutin: delicious, you can choose between bacon or mushroom gravy. I like the peppers on top.2) The mussels and fries: it's an appetizer but I had it as a dinner dish. Very good, mussels we're cooked perfectly and the wine broth was also good. The fries and grilled bread were a great addition.3) The fish fry: we've has this dish twice and it was good the first time but too oily the second time. 4) Broccoli cheddar soup was underwhelming and under seasoned. 5) Salmon and soba noodle is my favorite dish here. The salmon is delicious. The problem we've had here is that the experience goes down each time we go.While it's a great place overall I think that consistency is lacking. The first time we went the food was perfect. The second time we went the fish was soggy. And the last time we went the fries we're too salty and the fish was soggy again."
"I had the ""magi."" It was delicious.  I was disappointed when I asked for a bloody mary and I wad told it was BYOB, but there's a bar next to bite cafe, which is connected to this place.  .....I was confused, but it was like going from one world to another.  One business is a restaurant, but if you leave that room, go into the waiting room and into the third room-bam!- you hit the bar.....It was a lovely, unique experience!  Go! You won't be disappointed!"
Had the eggs Benedict and it was exceptional. The place was packed with hipsters to the brim. Quite interesting.
"I came here with a friend for brunch on a super cold windy day and we were asked to wait outside since there isn't really a waiting area inside. By the time we were seated I couldn't feel my legs anymore. So it's not necessarily an ideal place to come in winter unless you're willing to freeze outside. Once we were seated, it took a while for our waiter to come. When we saw that a table seated after us was already attended to, my friend ended up going to the f front to ask about our server.In terms of the food, I ordered the pork hash and was underwhelmed by the flavor. It looked really appetizing but the pork was too salty and the rest was just bland. I had high hopes for this place. Maybe I'll give it another go, I'm not sure."
"Went with a friend yesterday and was pretty disappointed. We were told it would be a 20 minute wait which was fine. We waited next door where there was a craft show going on. When we were called we sat at the counter and were served coffee by a very cranky waitress. She dropped our coffee mugs so hard on the counter the coffee sloshed over the edges. My friend asked the waitress if she recommended the leek bread pudding, 2hich was the special, or the grilled cheese. The waitress seemed annoyed and recommended the grilled cheese since she did not know if the specials were any good.I ordered the crispy pork belly breakfast sandwich with fries and my friend ordered the grilled cheese with tomato soup. It took 45 minutes to get our food and I was given hash browns instead of fries. We sat at the counter so we could see my friend's grilled cheese just sitting in tge pick up window 20 minutes. My guess is they messed up my sandwich but I wish they would have said something or at least fed my friend instead of having her food just sit.Food was good but not worth the wait or the bad service."
"Well worth the price for a nice brunch. The place is small, so try and go off peak.  We had the grilled cheese/tomato soup combo and the house Ruben w/fries.  Both sandwiches had very crispy bread and held the ingredients nicely."
"Simply put, this is no ordinary pub/cafe/restaurant. The first time I ate there, I had dinner. They have great mussels and potatoes. I can't remember what I had the first time, but it was so delicious I chose this restaurant for my birthday dinner last year.The braised pork belly was perfectly cooked and tasty. The duck confit was delicious. What makes their entrees so great is that they prepare the dishes well, choose quality greens and starches to go along, and tie it all together with thoughtful sauce and flavor combinations. The menu is New American with different specials like risottos and braised meats. Another time I came back for brunch and was happy I did. The Challah bread french toast was a good start and big enough to share. The pork hash was filling and so yummy. The right amount of spicy Hollandaise and tender pork shoulder paired well with the roasted and slightly sweet butternut squash. I can't wait to go back and try the other dishes.The service has always been good and though the space is a little small, the decor and atmosphere make it feel warm and cozy. Even when it was busy for dinner, I thought the service was friendly, quick, and helpful with suggestions and answering questions about the menu. I highly recommend trying this restaurant if you are looking for a place for quality New American food executed well--oh, the prices are cheap compared to other restaurants of this class."
"I went back to Bite this week, and although it was still good, there were a few issues that make it necessary to knock off a star.We started with the poutine with mushroom gravy and it was fine, but not great and maybe not even good.  It tasted a little healthier than a regular poutine but the flavors were nothing special.I had the pork belly porcetta entrée and this dish completely  knocked it out of the park.  It was salty and fatty and delicious, definitely an A+ dish.  My friends had the asparagus and cheese grits meal and the Tues night special filet mignon.  I'm told both were very good.Now, dessert was a big letdown.  I had the salted fudge brownie again, and unlike last time, the salt was too heavy-handed.  I had taken too many bites to send it back, but it was not good.  The fried challah bread pudding was excellent though.On the whole, this is a good restaurant and I'll be back, but not quite five-star worthy this time around."
"Went here last night for dinner and wanted to love this place but it really missed the mark. Although it's possible that we just ordered the wrong things.1. Love that this was BYOB and that you can buy beer/wine from the bar next door. Makes it easy when you forget your own booze. Also loved the decor - super cozy & cute.2. Had the hangover salad to start - this was a hit, likely something I'll try to recreate at home.3. Mac and Cheese - hard for me not to order and while it was tasty it wasn't my favorite and probably not worth the cals. No breadcrumbs, or bacon - they kept it straight and to the point but still wasn't my favorite. 4. Steak Tacos on Special - both my dad & boyfriend ordered these, I didn't try them but mainly they didn't like them. They did not look great - the meat looked sub par quality and they had a weird sauce on them as well, would stay away from this.5. Falafel sandwhich - Amazing french fries, sandwhich was heavy and nothing out of the ordinary. Other things on the menu jumped out at me: grilled cheese & tomato soup, whitefish on special, burgers - I really think we just ordered wrong. Other things that people ordered around us looked much better than the options we selected. Would go back & maybe even for brunch!"
"Interesting, homey BYOB place with really good food.I came here with a couple friends. Food is excellent, and the service is very nice. It's quite small, and you can feel a little shoulder to shoulder with your neighbors, but the noise level is fine. It's nicely priced - you need probably one more dish than you have people, which works out to about $20-25 with tip per person. That's great for the delicious food here.The Fried Oysters and Grits were particularly memorable. The Chili Vinegar on top gives a great kick. We also had the poutine, which was tasty, though not totally memorable. You can buy a bottle of wine next door at the Empty Bottle and carry it right back, so it's really BYOB in name only. Loved it; will definitely go back."
"LOVED this place.  If you're a fan of places like Lula, and enjoy VERY FRESH creative delicious food, check it out.The only thing that wasn't for me was the coffee - has more of that dark roasty flavor than I'm partial to.Cool interior, interesting menu (plus plenty of breakfast classics)Even scored free parking to the north of the building on a weekday morning."
"I'm a fan!!! Was curious about this place based on the stellar reviews on yelp and it sure didn't disappoint. Everything we ordered was excellent. Chopped summer salad was light & refreshing & perfectly dressed. Drumsticks had crackling skin and juicy interior. Catfish stew had an interesting kick an perfect for chilly fall days. Short ribs were fork-tender and oh-so-flavorful. Mussels were tender and juicy and the broth was to die for. If I had to nitpick, the sausage appetizer was probably the least exciting. Pot de creme dessert was a bit too salty for my sweet tooth but given how good the main dishes were, I think they still deserve 5 stars! Service was also great. Love!"
"I wasn't sure what to expect out of the Bite Cafe. However, I will admit I was very pleased. I was worried during the beginning of our experience when they skipped our name on the waiting list. Their host stand seemed unorganized. This worried me because the host stand is the core of a restaurant. Nonetheless, that is truly my only complaint of my experience.My boyfriend and I shared the falafel plate and two specialty entrees of pork chops with a fluffy polenta cake and blueberry compote and a ramp pesto gnocchi. The gnocchi was outta sight and the pork chop was cooked perfectly. Daren, our server, was friendly, attentive and did everything to make our experience worth 5 stars. I would definitely recommend this to a homie."
The service blows. I was waiting for 10 minutes for a menu. Then I waited for over an hour and still had no food. A staff told me they lost my order due to kitchen fire something and they are making my food. 15 minutes later I still had no food. The server didn't offer any toast or anything to hold me over. Nothing! I left starving.
My favorite breakfast. I've been eating here about once a week (at a minimum) for over three years. Just love it.
"I ditched my friends who were playing volleyball to eat at Bite Cafe. They were really mad at me, but when I said that it was because I went to get brunch at Bite, they understood.Pork Hash. BYOB."
"We came here as part of our Wicker Park brunch tour, as big lovers of brunch (and obviously Wicker Park). Bite was next on our list. It was a little out of the way of the Division and Milwaukee stretches, but we still ventured over there. We were quoted a half-hour wait on a Saturday and were informed we could wait in Empty Bottle next door. We waited in the vestibule area for 30 seconds, discussing if we actually wanted to wait 30 minutes or not, and the hostess came out telling us we weren't allowed to stand there. Fine. We went over to Empty Bottle, which was filled with some kind of art fair and also a bar. We saw people eating at the bar and realized that we would maybe be able to eat there. We decided to look around and wait. It was loud and we noticed the hostess walking around yelling out names, which may have been difficult to hear. Luckily, we heard our name when it was finally called.We walked through to the restaurant area. The actual dining space is small. Out tattooed waitress wasn't particularly helpful. When we ordered three entrees (one of which was poutine to share), she made a judgmental comment about how it was too much food for two people. We requested the poutine to come out first, like an app, which did happen. It tasted good and portions were big. My meat-lover skillet was also decent, but nothing to write home about. The poutine was probably my favorite. She gave us the check with NO PEN. She was nowhere to be seen after that, so I ended up having to write on the check with my girlfriend's eyeliner pencil. Ridiculous. Honestly, food was pretty good here and probably deserves four stars, but service was pretty lacking. We tried it, so now we won't have to come back. We will be back to Empty Bottle, though."
"We really enjoyed the specials here. Steak filet and pork shoulder steak. I guess we were in the mood for some protein haha. Plus, we usually like to go for any specials of the day that the restaurant might be having. It's like they were experimenting with some ingredients and came up with something thoughtful and amazing and wanted their customers to try it. Or it could also be that they are trying to ""get rid"" of certain ingredients that they have too much of? I don't know. I'm just rambling now.I love that it's BYOB without any corkage fee! Awesome for those of you who are looking for some good eats to go with your bottle of wine that you got from Trader Joe's for only $5. Because that's exactly what I did. Heehee."
"Cozy brunch place with friendly service. The pimento cheese eggs benedict was amazing -- can't recommend it highly enough. One of the best breakfast dishes I've had -- delicious mix of flavors and textures with a slight kick. The crispy pork belly, egg, and cheese biscuit was good too but not at the same level. Prices are very reasonable for the quality of food."
"I went to bite with my husband for our 3rd anniversary (we wanted something cozy and romantic for our special day). When we came in our hostess greeted us kindly. One of the reasons I like coming into town, especially to places like this, is that you get to see cool artist-types but without the attitude. She was friendly and gave us a pretty reasonable wait time for such a packed restaurant (plus I loved her hair -- I have nooooo idea how she got it to be that color). We got to wait next door in the bar and drink bloodys (not a bad deal if you ask me! But next time I'll bring my own bottle of chard). Overall the menu is a soulful, eclectic mix: eggs Benedict, French toast - but I don't get why so many restaurants these days have bi bim bop on the menu (must be some sort of east meets west food trend, can't say that I'm not over it already) We ordered the grilled cheese and the pork hash. The grilled cheese was beyond buttery and so tasty my hubby was almost in tears! Overall great place for brunch- the service was attentive and the food was tasty. Great spot especially for a special day!"
"Perhaps it was because we were incredibly hungry but the meal we had here was absurdly good. Let me start with the fact that we went for dinner on a Saturday night and had no wait - there were plenty of open tables. One would take this as a sign that it's not a great place, but that's just not true.We ordered the mac & cheese ($6), the beet salad ($9), and the burger ($10).Mac & cheese: I am picky about my mac & cheese and Bite Cafe lived up to my standards. It wasn't the least bit dry and it had a ton of flavor without having to add things like bacon or peppers. It was delicious.Beet salad: This was so, so good. Goat cheese and beets is a fantastic combo. My friend thought it had too much vinegarette, but I disagreed.Burger: It was HUGE and I enjoyed every bite. Most importantly, they didn't overcook it.I thought the prices matched the portions really well; we left with leftovers. The service was quite good - very friendly and helpful. The atmosphere was cozy but not overly loud.I would definitely go back here to try more things on the menu (I wanted to order them all!) and the delicious-sounding specials. We loved Bite Cafe."
"Probably my own fault for ordering something I didn't like, but I got the fish special of the day and it was too full of capers for me to eat and/or enjoy. The boyfriend ordered sausage which was much better. We shared the poutine which was spot on! I recommend the poutine! It's BYOB which is always awesome. I will definitely be coming back to try something different and will be sure to update the review!"
"Cozy, quirky place with an interesting menu! Not feeling very adventurous, I got a cheeseburger with fries and split the Hangover Salad (romaine, croutons, bacon, poached egg, vinaigrette dressing) with a friend. Loved the burger!! Just the comfort food I wanted taken up an extra notch.Others in our party got the mussels with fries, roasted rabbit, and coconut milk catfish. I think everyone enjoyed their meal."
"Ohhhhhh where do I start with Bite Cafe. I've been coming here relatively regularly with my girlfriend since this past summer, and we're never disappointed! The atmosphere is tasteful and modern, cohesive colors, cool screen prints on the walls.Breakfast available every day until 5:00 pm, the French Toast, Eggs Duncan, and $3 breakfast tacos are standbys, not to mention the excellent Dark Matter coffee.For dinner, we love the Beef Short Rib (when it's available), it's just like Mom's pot roast from home! The oysters with grits are an amazing combination as well. Everything is skillfully prepared so you really can't go wrong.Service is top-notch whether you're the only people in the place or if it's packed. Try the shakes too, if you look toward the back of the cafe they're listed on a chalkboard on the lower-left corner. We've also had a butterscotch Pot de Creme which was nothing less than spectacular. Try this place, you'll be back again.... and again... and again........... and again."
"tried the..Poutine - French Fries, Bacon Gravy, Cheese Curds, Pickled Chiles- it was ok.. didnt taste bacon or any bacon flavor...Mussels and Fries - Shallots, Garlic, Bacon, Smoked Paprika Butter, White Wine- looked really good and the mussels was cooked just  right.. but needed a little more flavor..Falafel Sandwich - Smoked Eggplant, Chickpea, Tomato, and Herb Salad  . kale salad - i like it.. the ingredients was fresh.. and the portion was a good size..Housemade Rye Pappardelle - Caraway, Charred Tomato Sauce, Golden Raisins,Capers, Broccolini, Parmesan - looked weird but it wasnt bad.. i didnt know what i was eating but it had good flavoring to it lol.."
I pretty much want to eat here all the time! Those little delicious tofu tacos make me so happy I could do a back flip. It's BYOB and and has super reasonable prices considering the food is very high quality. The bathroom is located through the kitchen which some people might not like but I like to creep on the line cooks so yay! One of my favorite things about this joint is it's located right next to the Empty Bottle. It's the perfect place to fill up and get a little saucy before getting your face melted.
"I ordered take out with my roommate on a Friday night and decided on Bite Cafe since their menu looked so enticing and it's conveniently only a couple blocks away. I'm so glad we finally decided to try out Bite! We called in our order and it was ready in 20 minutes. I ordered the grilled cheese with tomato & fennel soup. Once I got home I didn't find any soup! :( I called Bite right away and asked to see if we placed our order wrong, but they confirmed the grilled cheese comes with the soup. The gentleman I spoke with was very apologetic and I ran back to grab the soup. They even included a brownie and ice cream for the trouble. I'm so glad I ran back to get the soup. In my mind, there are fewer combos that are as perfect as grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese was on thick pieces of buttered sourdough bread. It had the perfect amount of crunchiness and I loved the combo of cheese they used. The soup was creamy, but not too heavy. I liked the addition of the fennel. I know fennel can have a strong licorice taste, but it wasn't overpowering at all and gave the soup character. I probably could've gotten away with just eating the sandwich though. It was very filling.The brownie and ice cream was also great. My roommate and I split it the next day and warmed the brownie up in the microwave. It's a very fudgy brownie and I liked the bite from the chocolate chips. I also have a love for the chewy edges of brownies and this one definitely had a nice chewy edge. Bravo Bite Cafe! I can't wait to dine in with y'all!"
"i have been here a couple times for the brunch. The food ranges from ok (the pork hash and french toast) to poor (chicken and biscuits). I like runny eggs, but I specified that I wanted them well done to avoid undercooked whites. Of course, the eggs arrived and most of the egg whites were clear and raw. There was also too much potato. Otherwise, the hash is not bad, but not as good as those at Yolk or Original Pancake House. The chicken and biscuits were bad. There was barely any chicken. The $12 dish was 75% biscuit and 10% gravy and cabbage. The biscuit was quite dry and the gravy a bit gloopy (maybe from cornstarch?). Not at all delicious, and so overpriced. We had a pretty negative experience with the service. The lady seating people asked us to wait in the adjoining room until our third person arrived. We did for a while, then our third person did arrive, and we informed her as she had instructed. There was an empty table for four, but she gave it away to a party that had just come in. Not a big deal, because another table of four had just left. Minutes passed, and no one came to clear the table. She asked us to wait in the adjoining room.We went back to the adjoining room to wait, but there was a band was practicing with percussion, and it became so loud that we couldn't hear or talk over the noise. We went back to wait in a corner of the dining room. The table was still uncleared. The seating lady again asked us to go back to the adjoining room or wait outside (this is in December, so it was cold). I don't understand why she was so keen on herding us away and adamant that we wait somewhere else, as the dining room was pretty empty and we were in a corner, not in anyone's way. Maybe they shouldn't play deafening music in the only other place they have customers wait. Maybe they could have explained why it takes ten minutes to clear a table. We felt like we were more a nuisance than customers."
"I've been here quite a few times, and I think the A-Ok yelp rating definitely fits the bill. The waitstaff has been pretty decent.  I've never had to wait too long for anything I've needed or wanted.  I think they definitely have a hipster requirement in order to get hired though, so they have a little bit of that hipster malaise going on.  But over all, they've been cool.  I've had quite a few different dishes:-the tomato soup and grilled cheese was probably the best dish that I had-the veggie burger was a little mushy, but the bun and the fries were delicious-the eggs duncan was probably the worst of the bunch.  The biscuits were good, but there was a ton of spinach and cheese and peas on top which made everything a bit more mushy than I'd like. They serve dark matter coffee which is always a plus.  Overall a cute, decent restaurant.  Prices aren't outrageous either."
"My friends and husband came here to eat on a Saturday early afternoon. I hear this place gets really crowded so my husband and I came early to get a table..like around 10am. They weren't as busy but unfortunately my friends were running late so we had to wait for them. They won't seat everyone until the whole party is there. We waited a little over an hour for my friend to show up, and the staff were nice enough to reserve the table I saw for us. I did leave my name with her when I first went in...so it was nice the table wasn't given away. It's a cute little cafe..baby blue chairs, stools, but dark artwork. For food, I thought it was decent. I liked it, but my husband not so much. I ordered the pork hash which I found to be very good. It's pork shoulders on top of a garlic bread with eggs on top with a specific sauce. I also ordered their biscuits and gravy as a side...its  a very strange biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were hard! That was not tasteful...I shared it with my friends and all of us just finished half of it..just because it is so different than the biscuits and gravy we had before. My husband had their cream of potato soup which was decent..no potatoes, but there were bacon chunks. It's a potato soup base with chunks of bacon. As for entree he had the egg duncan. I thought it was good, but he thought it was just okay. I like the spinach..but his biscuits were hard as well. My other friends ordered similar things as us, and they thought it was ok.Overall, decent brunch place. Interesting items on their menu  - it's not your standard brunch food but it is very fun to try new things! Service is good."
"I came here on a Sunday night for dinner for 4 people and expected a long wait but we were seated right away. I ordered the burger with pepper jack cheese and a fried egg. It was pretty good for the most part. The patty was thick and juicy. My girlfriend had the crispy duck leg confit served with Brussels sprouts and butternut squash. She loved it! She said the squash was a nice touch to the duck leg and the Brussels sprouts were amazing. This dish was small though and she had room for dessert. I got to try the gnocchi from my friend and let me tell you, this was amazing. She has been dreaming about this dish since she tried it and I can see why. I will be ordering this dish the next time I come here.Since we weren't too full, we ordered the gingerbread cake and salted fudge brownie for dessert. The gingerbread cake was topped with apple better and whipped cream. This was good but it was a little too overpowering. The salted fudge brownie was topped with vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. This was amazing! There was enough ice cream for the whole brownie. This really hit the spot. I will definitely be back to try brunch soon!"
"I love this place.  They never seem to disappoint me.  I swear it's always delicious, all the new stuff I try every time.  Also the portions are pretty good for the price and the staff is friendly."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago, for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Everything is fantastic, and they have tons of vegetarian options/accommodations. For example you can sub tofu for ANY brunch entree with eggs. My dream. Super cute inside. It's BYOB, but they also have a full bar due to Empty Bottle being next door; while you're waiting for a table you can buy drinks and then bring them to your table when it's ready. I highly recommend Bite!!"
Was there for a breakfast with my wife. Tasty. Big portions. Not expensive. Close to home. Happy)
"This is my our go to place in the neighborhood. We are spoiled and live down the street from here. Just about everything they have on their menu is fantastic. Some of my favorites breakfast, brunch, lunch and dinner. Can you tell I go there ALL THE TIME!!"
"Tried this place on a whim and loved it. It's small and a bit cramped, so be prepared.We tried the apple pie bread (yum!) and a biscuit with mushroom gravy- soooo good. Us non-pork eaters are usually SOL when it comes to biscuits and gravy but if there's ever a non-sausage option I usually gobble it up and this mushroom gravy was great.I asked if their OJ was fresh squeezed and our waitress said, ""Yes, but not by us!"" which made me laugh. Points for honesty! :)Husband loved the coffee- a bit too strong for me but I'm more a tea drinker than coffee so I guess you can't trust my opinion anyway. He had the steak and eggs and I had the migas- all good. My migas tasted better with his leftover salsa verde over the top so it worked out nicely! Prices also seemed fair. His steak and eggs were $15 and my migas (easily enough to feed 2 if you both shared an app or something) was under $10 I think. Super nice waitress and friendly service. A+ !"
"Great for Breakfast.  There is usually a bit of a wait on the weekends, but it's worth it.  They let you hang out in the empty bottle where you can sit at the bar or in the lounge and order coffee or drinks.I had the chorizo special.  The chorizo was some of the best I've had along with a good portion of fresh cooked peppers, onions, and zucchini. with 2 eggs over easy.  The staff is also great."
i love how it's connected to the empty bottle bar so if you're waiting forever to be seated for dinner you can at least grab a drink or two.byob with no corkage fee ++++the pork shoulder is a knockout.
"I played hooky one day from work and decided to go here for brunch. It was very empty, since it was 11am on a Tuesday. The service wasn't great. The guy got our orders very confused and he didn't stop by the table too often so it took awhile to get things corrected, but I will give it to him that he was apologetic and fixed the situation. I BYOBed some champs for mimosas. We tried the biscuits with jam, the breakfast taco, the hash and the fried chicken. My favorite was the hash, and my least favorite was the taco. Everything was amazing."
Food was decent but it took 45 minutes to get 2 sandwiches. Our waitress was kind of crabby too. I see no reason to come back.
"My old coworkers and I met up here for a quarterly now becoming brunch BYOB gathering. We were seated when our last person got in the door. It was perfect timing, and maybe the weather kept others from venturing out. We brought 3 bottles of champagne and went to town on a carafe of freshly squeezed orange juice. I ordered the Pork Hash and was very happy with my meal. The portion was right and it was very tasty. I also got to try my friend's Bi Bim Bop which I was debating over, and that was also a great option. The staff was very friendly, and the prices were comparable to the area. I would love to come back."
"Amazing dinner last night! The best I've had in a long time! The service was terrific, the room was lovely, and the food divine!"
"Came in on a Thursday night around 9:00 with my husband and two of our friends. None of us had ever been before but were thrilled to find out that there was a non-sushi BYOB fairly close to home (west loop). I had read on Yelp that there are often long waits for this place, but we were seated right away, probably due to our later arrival time.Food was excellent, but service was a little spotty. Our server was super nice, but it was very obvious that she had too many tables. When we arrived, we were quickly seated and given menus and waters, but our server didn't come by to take our order, not even for apps, until 15 minutes later. There were only a couple of empty tables when we arrived but only two servers for the entire restaurant! Not the servers' fault, of course, but something management should be aware of.Poutine: ordered the poutine with mushroom gravy and asked the server to leave off the chiles - I'm Canadian! Peppers don't belong on poutine! It was AWESOME. Easily the best poutine I've had in Chicago - yes, better than BadHappy!Tofu Tacos: the spicy slaw was too spicy for me, good thing I ordered it on the side. The tofu was nicely seasoned. Tacos were good but nothing special.Short Ribs: hubs ordered this. I'm a vegetarian so I didn't try it, but he was very happy with the quality and quantity of the meal. At $14, I think this is probably the best deal on the menu!Burger: friend had the burger with egg, cheese, bacon - all the toppings. He said it was excellent and especially liked the consistency of the egg.Pork Gyro: this is a huge meal! the gyro itself is stuffed with fries - kind of confusing since the way it was written on the board made it sound like it was a side of fries. But it does come with a side of mixed greens.Salted Chocolate Brownie: just ok. It was a good amount of saltiness but the brownie was thin and a little hard/dry. I prefer a more moist, crumbly brownie, which this was not. I probably wouldn't order it again - I'd try the bread pudding, though!Overall, I was really happy with this spot and we will definitely be back. For the 4 of us, our total bill was about $70 plus tip. Pretty amazing for the quality of food here! It really pays to BYOB! I can't wait to try out their brunch!Note: They were playing really weird, pretty loud metal music. Not sure if this is a normal occurrence, but it was kind of an ambiance killer. Also, the fact that you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom is just plain weird."
"All of the food is incredible, and I'm excited to go back ;o)"
"I super love Bite, especially because they are super vegan friendly. They have a rotating daily tofu scramble with seasonal vegetables that comes w/their mashbrown (vegan), which is this awesome fried smashed potato patty situation. Great salads and other awesome vegetarian options that can be made vegan. Also, they have crystal hot sauce on their tables, so that immediate elevates them in my book. BYO or you can grab a drink next door at the empty bottle if you don't BYO."
This small restaurant has great food and a great atmosphere.Perfect for a date night or small celebration. It is quiet BUT not stuffy with good music coming thru the speakers.The special on the board that night was squd ink linguini with a tomato cream sauce. I didnt have it but wished i had been brave enough. I had the short rib plate that was incredibly tender. My date had the drumstick plate which he lovedIm a dessert girl and had the challah bread pudding..YUMMOFriendly waitress.
"I have been to Bite Cafe too many times to count in the last couple years.  My last experience made me give up on one of my favorite byobs.  The service on this day was  some of the most atrocious I have encountered.  I stood in the door with another group of people.  The hostess came and took their name and told them something I could not hear and they left to wait next door.  I had to get her attention again as she left promptly after speaking with them, not realizing I was a different party.  No big deal.  I told her I would like a table for two and she asked for my name and told me the wait would be 20 minutes, I said ok, and went to wait at the empty bottle.  20 minutes go by and I see the group in front of me get called and seated.  30 minutes, then 40 minutes go by and my husband goes to check how much longer it will be since we see many empty tables.  He is assured by another host that it will be just a few minutes.  10 more minutes go by and I go to check with the initial hostess to see when we will be seated.  I am pretty annoyed at this point. She tells me at this point ""I told you that we are closing at 4 today and that you would not be seated after 3:30"" (its 3:50 at this point, I put my name on the list at 3pm).  So she lied to my face to cover herself in front of the other host.  There was no point in arguing that she told me 20 minutes.  I am not going to argue with a hostess who realized she forgot about us and has no remorse.  The host in question has blue hair, and I have no qualms about calling her out.  She was... I'll put it this way... not a nice person.On a side note, the food is pretty good.  The salads are always awesome.  The veggie poutine is great, and I love the grilled cheese / soup.  The daily vegetarian options ok, but usually a bit more bland than the regular menu items. Also, the chef is really awesome.  I am sorry to leave one star, but I really want management to get on the staff about the attitudes and how unorganized the list / waiting process is.  I know its a relaxed place, but I don't want to be disrespected.  I left so genuinely mad I was close to crying (hey I was hangry at this point)."
"I loved everything about Bite cafe and it's my new favorite place, with the tastiest options for vegetarian breakfast I've seen, and some meat options that almost had me dropping my vegetarian vows. Fantastic flavors on all dishes we had. Everyone in my group was very impressed with their food. All the dishes that came out for tables around us looked amazing as well and had us drooling waiting for ours. The mashbrown is SO GOOD. The tofu scramble is uniquely flavored and hearty. The vegetarian tacos are **the best I've had in Chicago**, and only $3 each, WHAT????The coffee is toasty and delicious. The decor is comfortable and relaxing. The prices are fair and reasonable (Pay attention here, Handlebar!).Will be back again and again!"
"My boyfriend and I came in for brunch and had a great time.  We just moved in down the street and were looking for the perfect brunch place we could come to regularly, and we found it.  The service was perfect, her name was Jen, and she was awesome. We sat by the window and it was very cute inside.  The food was great too!"
"I truly enjoyed my first visit to Bite Cafe!Quite a few friends have been talking about the awesomeness of this place for years.I stopped in around 1PM on a gloomy afternoon and it was pretty full. Wait wasn't too bad as we were able to wait in the middle space between BIte & the infamous Empty Bottle. You can shoot some pool, play video games and pinball while you wait or check out some of the cool art on the walls. Our wait wasn't too bad as it was maybe 15 minutes. This place is BYOB, but you can go right over to Empty Bottle to order your brunch drink of choice. I had a couple of mimosas which were awesome as they poured the precise amount of champagne and oj.The food was great as I decided on the Pork Hash which includes kale, two eggs, butternut squash, braised pork shoulder, sweet potatoes, spicy hollandaise on top of  toasted sourdough. It came in a nice sized bowl...was shocked I actually finished the meal. Wait staff is very nice in addition to having good food. The place itself is pretty small so I imagine the wait time probably being a little bit longer on the weekends (I came on a Monday)."
"My friend and I came here for brunch last summer.  This cute little gem is bright and cheerful, exactly what I needed after a long night out.It's byob, but we both weren't in the mood for drinking.  We shared the Fried Chicken Sandwich and Lemon French Toast.  Portions were hearty and perfect for the two of us.I'll be back to try dinner, with a bottle in hand!"
"My sister and I were looking for a byob in the neighborhood and stumbled upon Bite. We really did enjoy it. The staff were very attentive and helpful with the menu. My sister ordered the oysters, which she really enjoyed. There were plenty of them and full of sauce. I ordered the chicken and let me say, they weren't shy about their portion size. Due to the entree sizes, we weren't able to try their dessert. I'm a fan of bread pudding so I'm hoping I can stop by soon to try it out. The decor was nice and intimate. We were lucky to find an open table but it seems that reservations would be key since its not too big (at least what we saw). There is no cork fee so that was ideal too. This is a place I will definitely try again."
"A cool little joint hooked to the Empty Bottle.  We were playing a show there and had to get a quick bite before we played.  The Bite Cafe was nice, it's kinda a small place and at 5:30 it was slammed and full and with only one waitress (very nice by the way) it was hard for her to command everyone's attention. But the food was good I got a Vegan burger and they put in on Sour Dough for me cause the normal bun they use is not vegan so that was cool.. The burger was pretty good, definitely a more veggie flavored, Veggie Burger.. Not Black Beany at all. But good. If I had to do it over I would have probably got a side salad instead of the fries.  Cause the fries were good but they were also super greasy. All in all I think this is a cool little spot and nice service and good portion sizes. I would go back."
"This place rules so much!  Delicious food, BYOB, and an awesome and adorable staff!  There's usually a wait but head next door to Empty Bottle and sip on some coffee to pass the time.. It'll be worth it.Get the Pork Hash and try not to pass out from mega delicious super tasty wowaweewa flavor overload."
"This place is sweet. Awesome food and service. Enjoyed one of the specials and grilled cheese. Nice people and ambiance, felt great just being here. Thanks!"
"Checked out Bite Cafe for our last breakfast in 2013.  BYOB and I'd remembered to stock the ride with a bottle of Prosecco.  OJ could be ordered in sm, L or a carafe.  A large glass was more than enough for three sharing a bottle.  The place was packed and we waited in a warm car for about forty five minutes.  As others have mentioned via reviews, this is a small dining space with hardly any additional for those waiting on a table.  I bet this is a fun spot when its warm but while its cold, you need to dress very warm.  Many had their jackets on till they got used to the temperature.  It'd be wise if they called in an HVAC engineer to make use of their vents in the most appropriate of ways.  Or as I mentioned to my friends, change out a couple of the hanging bulbs with hanging heaters. (For serious, I hate to eat in the cold)The dining room is cute in an Martha Stewart home dining room kind of way.  Lots of exposed brick, few artsy pieces, matching this and that.  The space was small.  I imagine if their everyday patron were thin hipsters, it'd be alright.  But being that humans come in all sizes and this is winter when folks are adorned in warm jackets, you should mind when walking past tables.  There were times it was so busy we had llamas standing all around our table but that was the woe of getting a table in the walk path.  It was an experience.  Food was exceptional, service was alright and the washroom was slippery.  Blame the last bit on snowy boots.  We dined on pork hash, Eggs Duncan and a shared half plate of the challah French toast.  The exceptional were the Pork hash and Eggs Duncan which are a must.  The way eggs were ordered and coffee requests got bungled without a resolve.  I resulted to reordering from runners.  Those minor annoyances aside, breakfast was tasty and appreciated.  Per their website, menus and offerings I could see a future visit back for their Prix fixe menu or to try something late night."
"Mmm, one of my new favorite brunch spots in Chicago.  What an amazing treat!  First, as everyone has said, they do not take reservations - much like most of the best brunch places in Chicago.  The beauty of Bite Cafe is that they are connected to the epitome of ""hole in the wall"", the Empty Bottle.  There is a transition room between the two establishments with a couple chairs and an old pool table.  And then the bar is next door.  Bite Cafe is BYOB, which is amazing and gets more amazing when you realize that if you didn't bring your own booze, you can buy a drink at the bar next door and bring it with you.  The bloodies are pretty darn good.The restaurant atmosphere is much less hole in the wall and more hipster contemporary.  Friendly service, crowded tables, and a lively buzz of conversation.  We only waited about 20 minutes for our table for 2 on a Sunday morning at 11:00 last week.I'm embarrassed to admit that my friend and I were totally unoriginal when we ordered, because we couldn't afford to pass up what seemed like hands down the best option.  She ordered the pork hash...and I ordered the pork hash, without the pork.  Both were amazing.  Just a heaping bowl of deliciousness - potatoes, seasonal vegetables, and perfect flavor.  I don't normally eat the whole entree of anything but I basically licked my bowl clean this time.  My only complaint was that one of my eggs was over poached so my yolk did not drip down when I cut into it, but that's a small price to pay for the otherwise perfection of this dish.To be fair, everything on the menu looked pretty amazing as we saw it come out to other tables.  My only complaint (aside from the fact that they don't take reservations) is that they don't offer a vegetarian sausage option.  Come on people!  You're a hipster BYOB restaurant off of Western Ave - you have to offer a veggie sausage!  Even Prasino does it."
"Oh. My. Goodness. The breakfast poutine. I don't remember anything except the tasty, cheesy goodness of the poutine. Wait. That's a lie. The place is cozy and clean, and the staff was very nice and served us immediately. That's how we got the poutine that all dreams are made of - so perfect with its egg and crispy fries on top of crazy good curds and some gravy. I know there was other stuff in there, but those were my faves. That's all I've got - memories of the best. poutine. ever. Get over there and get some!"
"Amazing food and service, the escargot pasta was a perfect ending to a wyld night at empty bottle next door. Alec, our waiter, was a dream boat with a deep sadness."
"I feel like I come here once a weekend. Bite is great; I love the grilled cheese, the cheeseburger, the tomato soup, the bacon... my girlfriend OBSESSES over the biscuits, I tell ya.Always the best service, great prices, charming atmosphere, great menu, cool people... everything about this place is so cool, and I'm so happy it's just a couple blocks from my place. I haven't tried their special pizza nights and whatever else but I really want to. Breakfast or dinner- this place is wonderful."
Yummy breakfast poutine with bacon gravy. The gravy had small thick chunks of bacon. The poached eggs were perfect and added to the deliciousness of the meal. My friend got the vegetarian version and loved it. The mushroom gravy was also as tasty. My other friend got the migas and devoured it in its entirety. All the food was great and the coffee was Dark Matter.
"Love love love this BYOB.  This last Sunday they had escargot which was fantastic and poutine - who doesn't love poutine?  I had the pork belly, which was basically a huge slab of bacon and was delicious.  My wife's salmon was also excellent, as was my mom's ravioli.  The bread pudding dessert was outrageous.It's very small, so you may have to wait, but it's well worth it.56/365"
"We had a car for the day and were looking to explore outside of our usual bubble... so we went where the hipsters go!  After several Yelp and Urban Spoon searches, this is where we ended up.The atmosphere: Shame on us for waiting until 11:00 a.m. on a Saturday in Chicago to go to brunch - The place was packed!!  It's not very large and it's a challenge to walk around the tables, but decor is adorable.  We wanted to eat right away, so we sat at the bar - it was kind of fun to watch the chefs in back!The food: I shared everything with a vegetarian and had no problem bc they had vegetarian options for pretty much everything (within reason).  I kept watching the homemade biscuits come out of the kitchen and knew I just had to try one... We started with a biscuit and muschroom gravy.  It was more delicious than words; I could've eaten an entire meal of these.  We then had two breakfast tacos, the breakfast poutine, and sides of fried tofu and bacon.  Both main courses were imaginative with fresh ingredients.  We were so stuffed by the time we got to the poutine, but couldn't stop eating!  But still... those biscuits.The service: The waitresses were very nice, even though they were very busy.Next time: We'll be back!  It's BYOB too and we didn't know that... so definitely an option to explore.  We've heard the Empty Bottle next door is a lot of fun too!"
"I stopped in with a guest for a light bite after a quick Yelp search led us here.  Not really hungry for a full meal, we went with the Tofu Black Bean Taco's each, shared a poutine, had some bread pudding and coffee.  For 3 bucks, the tacos were well worth it. Huge piece of tofu, with spicy slaw. The poutine was quite delicious. We went with bacon in the poutine, which was good. I might recommend a bit more bacon, but still good. She was really wanted bread pudding after being disappointed that another place ran out before she could get to it. So, this was my surprise to her. The bread pudding is awesome.  My golden rule of ""if it ain't chocolate, I ain't eatin' it"" was broken here. Very tasty, topped with whip cream and well worth it. We went in expecting a light bite and ended up leaving quite full.  Outside of the food being wonderful, it is a really cool place to go to. Classy, exposed brick wall décor and the service was wonderful. I've lived in the area for quite some time and not sure why I've never stopped in. I would recommend it if you get a chance."
"My lovely friends treated me out to a belated birthday dinner last night at Bite Cafe. They rave about this place, so I couldn't wait to try it. The atmosphere is very relaxed and casual. It's a great for a dinner with friends or a casual date. They don't take reservations, but if you do happen to wait, it'll be worth it. The service is on point all around. They are very attentive, and don't rush you at all. Another plus is that they are BYOB, so bring your favorite beer and/or wine to have with dinner!The food is absolutely delicious. We shared the Beet Salad and Mussels and Fries appetizers. The Beet Salad was very fresh. The Mussels were also very tasty, especially the broth. My friend even asked the waiter for extra bread just so that we could finish it--yum!For dinner, I had the Pan Fried Chicken Thigh. It was SO good. I would highly recommend it if you are in the mood for chicken. I also tasted the Pan Roasted Steelhead Salmon and the Skate (Fish) special. The Salmon was good, but slightly lacked in flavor. The Skate (Fish) was very tasty and preferred it over the Salmon. I was almost too full for dessert, but decided to end the night with the Vanilla Creme Brulee. Best decision ever. Get it if you can! Bite Cafe is a wonderful place and I really can't wait to come back."
My wife and I ate here last night and were quite impressed. Lots of foodie options. Staff was very welcoming and the atmosphere was cozy and sweet.
"We came here on a snowy Friday night for dinner. The wait was an hour but luckily we were able to wait it out at the Empty Bottle music venue connected right next door. A very unique setup.The overall atmosphere is trendy and comfortable. BYOB is a huge plus here as it keeps the check price down and you can spend the savings instead on the all-star food. The menu is enticing - everything looked so good that it was tough to decide. The fatty in me went with the poutine and the fried oysters with grits. Both were delicious but if I were smarter I would have balanced out the meal with a vegetable side as I felt the full weight of carb overload take hold of me.Bite Cafe, you can count on me to become a repeat patron!"
"An uptight blonde in a sea full of hipsters and it didn't even matter, Bite doesn't judge, they just slang fire food. We had a late brunch at Bite yesterday, and it quickly shot up onto my list of top 3 brunch spots, sorry Bongo, you've been demoted. The atmosphere is chill and inviting, and unlike dozens of other local brunch spots, there is a pool/waiting room adjoined so when there is a wait, you're not packed like ravenous sardines around the perimeter of lazing, gluttonous patrons taking their sweet ass time finishing their meal - cue rage. I digress, we were seated right away at Bite and the very friendly waitress steered us in the right direction, recommending a few of her favorites. We settled on the Migas and Pork Hash, with a side of fries just because they looked like the absolute perfect specimen of fries, and they were. The Migas is basically chilaquilles, flavorful, delicious, with solid texture despite most of the ingredients being from the 'mushy' family. The pork hash was on point as well, the meat was tender and juicy, and anytime you toss in tomatillos, I have no complaints. We cheers'd the meal with grapefruit juice fuelled by our own BYOB Prosecco. Could this place be any more perfect? Oh wait, it could, and it was, a smooth tasty chocolate milkshake topped with rich whip cream and rainbow sprinkles to top the meal off! Bliss! I can't wait to come back over and over again."
"Went here yesterday for brunch. We arrived early and there was no wait. The staff was extremely friendly and I have no complaints about the service we received. The coffee was good and regularly topped off. My complaint is with the food. I ordered the pork belly with a side of mash browns. The mash Browns which were quite talked up by a member of the party were nothing more than what you could get if you bought a box of grocery store hashbrowns.  Not special. I ordered the pork belly on a cheesy biscuit with egg. The biscuit was flavorless and dry. Another friend ordered a biscuit and came to the same disappointing conclusion. Dry and flavorless. You can't market your biscuit as a star of the show, a feature item on the menu and have it be an utter disappointment. My pork belly was SO salty. Almost inedible. And the pork belly fat was tough and gelatinous rather than soft and spreadable. Pork belly can be amazing. This was a total waste of a great ingredient. Seriously. The level of salt was really nasty. There are so many great breakfast joints in the city, I wouldn't bother to ever try this one again. My sister said her tofu scramble was good however."
"The food (brunch menu at least) is delicious. I had the eggs Duncan and it was to die for. The bi bim bop was a good adaptation on the original. The food is amazing, the decor was cool, but to be honest, the service was amazing. I was in town for work and family drove up from Indiana to meet for brunch and the staff were so understanding of and patient with our odd arrivals. They graciously offered to take the suitcases out of the way and they bent over backwards to accommodate my baby nephew. The hostess offered to hold him when he was crying and she played peek-a-boo with him. They are the nicest people."
"Small, but cute space. Food was excellent.  We shared the bibimbop, the strawberry bread, the biscuits (I skipped that because I hate gravy), and the special omelet (fresh asparagus and spinach - yum!).  A little hard to get to, but will definitely return."
"Oh My Tomato! The tomato fennel soup was amazing. The grilled cheese that came along with it had a cheese variety melted together to create a wonderful combo to the soup, though I wish the tomatoes in the grilled cheese were juicier but thats just my taste buds. I am not a huge fan of pork but the pork hash was done well and the poached egg just opened my eyes to a new side of eggs. The food was great, the service was timely, and the cost was just right (average for a dine-in Cafe)."
"Bite Café strictly abides to their time schedule. 10:15pm on a Friday...Tick tock...tick tock...is it 10:30pm yet? Some 15 minutes later, the late night menu finally unfolded. YAY! Show me the food! Falafel gyro, bite mac, grilled cheese, and poutine. The gyro was quite a delight, assuming you enjoy hummus and falafel. I wished I had ordered that instead of the grilled cheese which was nothing more than a plain Jane. The bite mac was a delicious stack of mess with the double patty and usual ingredients. The poutine was a complete disappointment. It was my first time having poutine. I'm certain that wasn't how it was supposed to be made. The fries were soft and drowned in what appeared to be dried lard. It was supposed to be smoked bacon gravy and cheese curd. Not quite... For dessert, we had fudge brownie and cardamom pound cake. Both are a huge slap on the self-conscious calorie scale, but I will have to worry about that later. The fudge brownie was freshly baked with the outer layer having a slight crisp. The sweet chocolaty richness was engulfed by the polarizing vanilla ice cream. Each bite was a melt in the mouth! The pound cake was less buttery than usual. That's a plus for those who are health-conscious!  The cake was paired with a side of toasted pistachios, marmalade, and vanilla whipped cream."
"Bite cafe is super adorable, definitely a perfect place for first date. The cafe itself is really beautiful, the noise is not too bad, its BYOB, you can walk through the kitchen, AND the food is delicious with a bunch of daily specials that are always changing. Empty bottle, which has live music, is right next door making it a perfect date. Couldn't recommend more strongly."
"This place has a good vibe great for brunch and overall good food ..it's conveniently connected to the empty bottle which is where you can wet your whistle or even buy a drink and bring it back to your table.  The service is phenomenal, and knowledgeable of all items on menu. Recommended!"
"We came here after a quiet night of drinking fancy beers at home. Suddenly we realized it was 11:00 and our only food options were sushi, pizza, or bar food. Where are all the late night options in Chicago? That's when we found Bite Cafe. Standing out the outside at 11:30, the restaurant was dark and empty. Oh no! Was it closed? We pulled the door, it opened, and we saw a lady standing by a register. BYOB in hand and desperate starvation in our face, we asked: Are you still open? She answered ""YES!"" Alleluia and thank God because the food was good!The poutine was right on point with the cheese curds just perfect. We ordered a side of the grits - how could one resist grits imported from Kentucky? Or was it Tennessee? Well, it was from a place that would have grits. Then the main courses: I had a pork shank that must have been deep fried at the end because it was perfectly crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. My boyfriend had spare ribs that were pumped full of meet.Service was top notch, food was superb, and the place was open til midnight! I'll definitely be back!"
"Bite Cafe offers everything I want for brunch. A cute little dining room that's vibrant and welcoming. A bar next door to wait for a table to open up. And delicious, delicious options ranging from sweet (french toast) to savory (bi bim bop). You can sub tofu for eggs on any option and even though I do love me some tofu, today was an eggs day and I settled on the eggs duncan. Two perfectly poached eggs (I mean, seriously, how do you get the whites THAT perfect?) a top two biscuits and a great creamed spinach and peas mixture. This was good ol' fashioned brunch comfort food at its best. Easily one of the best brunch spots I've been to in the city."
"Used to be great. Now it is inconsistent and mediocre at best. I miss the old Bite, the Bite I loved so much I would be there 3 times a week."
"BYOB & some of the best food I've had in Chicago. This place is a little gem that you must uncover ASAP. They make their own Kraut (German woman's dream). Also, everything I tried here was delectable.Make sure you try their fried oysters accompanied with grits (wherever those grits came from, they should be part of my last meal on earth). Also, I'm not a dessert lady but the fudge brownie had me on my knees. Stop reading this, grab a few bottles of vino, and get to Bite Cafe already!"
"Bad experience. This is my first negative review and I didn't want to do it. I went in for lunch and their were only 2 other tables occupied and one person at the counter. I was greeted with a nod from a server near the counter and sat myself at a table. A menu was given immediately and my coffee order taken. So far so good. I waited for about 10 minutes for anyone to return with the coffee or to take my order. My waitress did return and did both. I asked a question about carbs and what items on the menu would be considered lower in carbs and the face/attitude I received from the server was beyond disgust. I was wasting her time for sure. I also asked for a sugar substitute for the coffee. She said they had none. She gave me ""Truvia"". I had never had it and asked her what it was and she said ""I don't know, that's what we have"". Ok. I open my napkin which contains the silverware and there is no spoon. Just fork and knife. Nothing to stir the coffee. I grab a setup from the empty table next to me and find the same. No spoon. I guess they don't give out spoons unless asked. My fork was dirty as well. I try to make eye contact with my server as well as two other servers behind the counter (about 30 feet away) and no one looked in my direction for the entire next ten minutes while waiting for the food to arrive. They were quite busy laughing and chatting with each other though. At which point I surmised that the patron I thought was sitting at the counter was actually either an employee on break or someone known/related to this restaurant. Their convo/banter was well beyond the patron level. No problem. I stirred with the back end of my knife. Food comes. It was very good. Waitress then shows up every 5 minutes to refill my coffee. Cream is empty after second cup. She doesn't notice or even look. Ok. I was coffeed out anyway. Both other tables leave and I am the only one left except the person at the counter. I wait over ten minutes for the check. I pull out cash, I need to split. I never thought a quick bite would take an hour. I only ordered a salad (only low carb option). Waitress doesn't return. She is again involved with other staff behind the counter talking and smiling and seemingly having a nice chit chat. She never broke anything close to a smile in her brief forays to my table. I thought I was dealing with the milk lady in the cafeteria in third grade. You know, that one with the hair net and the mustache. Finally she looks over from the counter and asks across the empty room if I need any change. I say no, not able to wait any longer, and leave the cash on the table and exit. Summary: Food is very good. Coffee not bad. Splenda should be available. Put a spoon in your setup. Pay some attention to the customers. Smile every now and then. 2 stars for the good salad. When you need a semi dive joint that wants to pretend to be ""hip"" and there is nothing else around check it out. Would I return? No. I never liked that milk line lady anyway..."
"This is the place to get you're munchie fix, after burning a big fatty mcsticker! Such a different fusion style. Fresh, simple and chill. One of those places"
"I come here all the time. The food is great, the servers are sweet, you can grab a drink at the Bottle and bring it over. Pretty sure I would end a fully satisfying romantic relationship if I found out whoever I was dating disliked Bite. They need to bring back the Bite Mac for the late night menu every day of the week. I need it in my life.Update: I've been informed that the Bite Mac is indeed available every day of the week after 10pm now. I am pleased."
"Holy tomatoes, I never tire of this place! I come here about once a week- love it every time. We live a couple of blocks away, so that always helps.Their menu is the perfect length of simple- with variety. From the burger(veggie and meat options) to the breakfast poutine (bacon or mushroom options), to the simple single tacos and epic beet salads- I've loved just about everything I've tried here.OH OH! Also, I'm a stickler for awesomely poached eggs. Ooey Gooey in the center, not over done- these guys have made my poached eggs perfect every time.  I love you guys.Oh- and try the shakes, they're quite tasty too. I also enjoy the BYOB aspect."
"Came here on a sunday morning for brunch. 20 min wait time = NBD as you can wait inside the empty bottle and have a delicious cocktail or cheap beer and the hostess will come get you.  Definitely a big plus over places you're forced to stand around crammed into some small waiting area making small talk like a jabroni. Menu is large and good for veg. or carnivorous desires. BYOB is awesome too, the hostess gives you your hooch back once you cross back into Bite Cafe from EB. Great local spot and the pork hash was serious business and brutally good. Service n Staff top notch too. Keep crushing it."
"It's a hip little place but with its challenges. My mom and i went for brunch. I am vegetarian. I think it's a matter of knowing what to get. I did not like my food,  did not taste good and was just blah. My mom got the burger and said it was outstanding. It inspired me to get a veggie burger to go. I love that the burger comes with purple onions. So maybe the meat items are pretty good. The service was abysmal!"
This is the worst customer service I've ever dealt with in my life. she put the phone down when I called in for a pick up order. And proceeded to talk to some jerk off in there for about 30 minutes about how to Sand down the countertop .that's not her job. Answering the phone's and taking orders is her job. Obviously she does not know how to run a restaurant and needs to take people management skills . I for one will be boycotting this restaurant is long as I can stand on my own and pee!
"This place is just fantastic! Been going there since I moved to the area in Feb. I have never been let down. One thing I recommend is either getting there early, you tend to seat yourself."
"the food here was good unfortunately it came out at room temperature and quickly cooled. however, the quality was still good so i will be trying bite cafe again! also, it's byob with no corkage fee. aw yiss!"
"Great neighborhood spot.  The dishes are very reasonably priced and super tasty.  My wife had their grilled cheese, and I had the trout.  Both dishes were excellent.  Our table shared the bread pudding for dessert and it was fantastic.  Add on the fact it is BYOB, and you have a great night."
Great meal.  Byob and quick service for dinner.  Not sure why people complain about waiting at great byob place when they read there is always await......anyways had the smoked chicken special on Thursday night.  My favorite half chicken in the city.
"This place... so good! Popped into Bite Cafe over the weekend for brunch while I was out running errands, and I left full and impressed. The coffee is perfect, the Pork Hash is to die for and the wait staff is both friendly and responsive. Will definitely be back!"
My experience at this restaurant was not bad and not great. The gluten free options were few and pretty uninteresting. Not much else to say.
"DO NOT COME HERE.I want to keep this my neighborhood secret.  I want you to forget that it's BYOB.  Forget that you can listen to live music next door if there is a wait.  Forget that their Pork Hash is the best breakfast item in Chicago.  Forget that the staff is all incredible. Forget that its the menu always changes so you can have something different even if you come every week (like we do).Forget everything about it and keep it on your list of places that ""you've been meaning to try.""  I don't want you to actually go there and fall in love like we have because then it will be awkward as we fight for a seat at their cute little counter."
Absolutely delicious. Definitely a hidden gem that I will visit again. We ordered the muscles which were cooked to perfection. I had the pork and it was probably the best I've ever had. My boyfriend ordered the Thursday special which was a boil with sausage and he loved it.  The price is certainly right and its all topped off be being BYOB.
"When we first found out about this place (yes, I saw it on one of those local food shows. Admit it, you watch them too. And when I checked Yelp to see they had an almost perfect rating, I was sold) I wasn't aware that there was a dress code. Shoot, and I left my knit cap, black-rimmed glasses, and ironic t-shirt at home. But no worries, because every single other person in the restaurant had theirs on, even in 90-degree heat. Gotta hand it to the hipsters, they do their thing even when it's melty outside.Ok, I'm going to nix with the judgy judgy. Okay, first of all. Parking? Big problem. Aside from Western Ave. itself, almost everywhere nearby is residential only. DO NOT PARK HERE! RESIDENTIAL PARKING ONLY! NO PARKING! DO NOT THINK ABOUT PARKING! I swear they should put up a sign that says, ""JUST GO HOME"" because that's what I almost did. But upon finally finding a spot to park and making our way to the cafe, we went inside to find (hipster central, yes) a cute industrial looking space with brick walls and light blue metal chairs. Digging the look. A friendly girl in an airy dress and covered in tattoos took our name and said to wait outside. So we did, since the idea of waiting inside was pretty much impossible. No more than five minutes later (we expected 20-30) we were seated in a nice two-top in the window. We were handed paper menus that were divided into breakfast and lunch (brunch) options and immediately another nice tattooed girl took our drink order. SIDEBAR: Just to clarify, I have nothing against hipsters nor tattoos. I'm just stating their presence because to a suburbanite (or Jen Lancaster) they can sometimes be startling. Back to the review.Wifey ordered the breakfast poutine because poutine has been on her/our bucket list for awhile, thanks to the many Canadian food shows we watch, and also our friend Barb who loves the stuff (and is also Canadian). So yeah, I didn't like it. The fries were really salty and greasy. I don't like greasy fries. But Laura enjoyed it so I was glad of that.I had the pork hash, which was really tasty. The pork was tender and well-seasoned, the eggs were perfect and the potato/corn/pepper mixture really gave it a great flavor. Everything was freshest and didn't taste like it had been frozen or sat around, so big ups on my meal choice.Prices were fair, people were friendly, almost no wait on a Saturday morning. I really can't say anything bad about this place. Will I go again? Probably not, but only because I don't think it's good enough to drive to the Ukranian Village for, and haggle with parking. But if I lived down the street? Totally."
"One of my favorite spots, easily. I would call it that brand of hipster ""home style gourmet"" with fancy grilled cheese & tomato soup and other wise up scale, foodie takes on classics & original dishes. The menu changes seasonally & there are different specials every night. I love their version of Moule frites with big bacon chunks. The dessert menu: DON'T MISS THE BREAD PUDDING. Srsly though. Only possible issue, they have in the past occasionally dressed up cheaper cuts of meat on the menu, leading to some chewiness. I've been going regularly for about 4 years & this hasn't been a thing in about 2 years, so it gets all 5 stars easily. Quality is consistent, staff is rad, BYOB keeps it cheap. You can also always go next-door to empty bottle to grab a drink if you forget."
A few of the dishes are overpriced...lots of fillers like potatoes and bread. Nothing special - lots of other brunch places are much better.
"I love this place. We went on a cold December night and brought a bunch of beer with us because it's byob. For five people we probably waited a half hour at 7 on a Saturday but they kept our beer cold for us and came to get us from the bar next door when our table was ready. Cozy, friendly atmosphere and we tried lots of dishes to share, mac and cheese, poutine, etc. After several courses the bill was only about $20 for each of us, wow! I will and have recommended this place for locals and out of town guests alike!"
"I've always been kind of a curmudgeon when it comes to Bite Cafe.  I've been less than thrilled with the service, the brunch menu makeover was kind of disappointing and nothing ever stood out to me as being overly awesome.  I would never say it was baaaaad.  Just... not my absolute fave.  But being one of the only brunching options in the immediate area, it always served it's purpose.I'd never been in for dinner, though.  I figured if Bite Cafe never knocked me out of my panties for brunch, why bother with dinner?I'm a silly, silly girl.  Especially since I'm something of a mussels and frites slut.  Bite Cafe's rendition of my beloved mussels and frites ROCKS.  Rocks hard, yo.I think Bite Cafe may have my favorite mussel preparation ever.  It's a wine and butter sauce with leeks, tremendous amounts of garlic and bacon.  BACON for crying out loud!  The almost obscenely large, plump, tender and luscious mussels are swimming in this bowl of deliciousness just waiting to be gobbled up.  And it's a hearty, hearty portion, too, my friends.  Factor in a criminally large amount of crispy fries and you're pretty much talking about heaven.HEAVEN.Service has definitely stepped up a few notches since I first started going to Bite a few years ago.  Our gal last night was fabulous.  Incredibly attentive and didn't bat an eye at a table of five ladies with five bottles of BYOB wine that may or may not have all been finished.  Don't judge.So here's what: OK brunch still sitting at 3 stars, but a solid 5 stars for my mussel experience.  So round it out at a clean 4 star experience.Also, easy FREE street parking on Western Ave, aka Chicago's Largest Parking Lot."
Food was mediocre and the service was HORRIBLE. Both waitreses that were helping us had terrifiying attitudes and ruined our experience. The tables around us all felt the same way. TERIBBLE EXPERIENCE
"Well, after being so excited about my first visit, I encouraged a few more people to go back to experience the delicious food and cute space. I knew right when we walked in that this time was going to be different when our server gave a cold greetings upon entering. We got our table and picked out our meals. I suggested my friend try what I had last time. It was amazing. She asked if it was possible to make a dietary change, but the quick response was a simple 'no'. No asking, no suggestions for alternate dishes....just a nope. Well, it got weird after that. All of our food was good, but the first five minutes kind of killed the warm feeling that we walked in with."
"My roommate and her sister were headed to Bite Cafe one day for lunch.  It has been on my list of places to try, and I had an a la card to use there, so I figured why not give it a try.  We got in just as it was starting to pour outside, and the three of us plus a baby in a stroller where seated right away.  The atmosphere is pretty cool.  Check out their website for photo of the dining room. My roommate had been to Bite and had given it rave reviews, so I was excited to eat there.  I very briefly was on a no carb diet, so the options were pretty limited.  I wanted to try the Bi Bim Bop without the farro plus more veggies.  The server flat-out said no, without any explanation nor sensitivity.  I quickly tried to find something else on the menu and ended up ordering the black bean burger.  It was pretty standard for a veggie burger, not the best, not the worst.  Overall, I think I would have had a much more positive review had the server not been insensitive.  Service makes or breaks the dining experience, and more servers need to keep that in mind."
Pork braised shoulder was sooooo legit . Don't skip out on this place when you're in the Windy City
"Bite Cafe totally nails it for brunch! Small, cute little shop and probably a decent wait every weekend but well worth it. We waited 45 minutes and stomachs were growling but at least they have a waiting room in between Empty Bottle and their location. Had a lot of trouble deciding on my order but went with the Pork Hash. I was a bit nervous the portion size or at least amount of pork would be small but it was HUGE with a ton of pork. The pork shoulder was so tender and flavorful. The spicy hollandaise was the perfect compliment and mixed with the yolk from the eggs, brought everything in the hash together. Next time I am ordering the Chicken Thigh Migas which is similar to huevos rancheros but with chicken and scrambled eggs. Ugh if I wasn't so full I would have stolen it all off my friend's plate. Third buddy got the omelette of the day which was also packed with goodies. The food was REALLY good - made up for some errors in service but it was the day after St Pattys so we were all moving a little slow...Can't wait to go back to Bite!"
"Best poutine this side of the Danube. I ordered half and half bacon/mushroom gravy-both were REDONK. And then I also ordered a side of their siracha aioli. The waitress said it was an impressive order, had to wholeheartedly concur.Service: 5/5 everything was great, very nice staffAtmosphere 4.5/5Overall very unique. Some of the art was really out there and not the most appetizing in some cases but it was fine.  The restaurant is connected to this divey bar that's fun.  There  was a dj playing some good beats and what seemed to be a record/music exchange going on too, and a pool table for those who have a long wait.Food 5/5Already vetted the poutine fully. The frencht oats was also knockout.  Kind of tasted like an old fashioned glazed doughnut.  We medal so shared a taco which was top notch too.Its BYOB! the wait staff directs you to the bar for booze but there are some gem spots for those beer snobs out there very close by with huge selections.  We went to the Puerto Rico food and liquor spot which has a full selection of bomb brews (bells, founders, trapipists, left hand......)Overall this place rocks, if you are in the area and don't stop here brunch...shame on you!"
"After walking for several miles we stumbled upon Bite so it was a delightful discovery. Clearly they care a lot about creating quality food and their menu catered to my vegetarian/gluten free needs with an awesome soup and tofu tacos. The only reason I would not go for 5 stars is that the waitstaff were kind of cranky. It didn't seem particularly busy but they seemed overwhelmed. Also, they need to figure out a better bathroom option. Would definitely recommend this to foodies."
"I was super excited to try Bite, so I treated myself to breakfast here the other day on my birthday.  Easy parking at 9am on a weekday, right in front.  It is cold and snowy right now, and the restaurant was COLD!  Bring a jacket!  Service was attentive and fast.  I was torn between the hash and Eggs Duncan.  Since my mother made ""creamed"" everything as a kid, I decided to try the Duncan, with creamed spinach and peas over biscuits.  You cannot go wrong with creamed spinach or biscuits, and many yelpers recommended the dish.  It was pretty disappointing.  Boooo.  The biscuits had a nice flavor, but the creamed concoction was dull and lacking in flavor.  Even pepper did not redeem it a bit.The space is adorable with bright blue chairs.  Not a fan of going into the kitchen to use the restroom.  I actually hate this....Will come another time...for lunch!"
"2 pm on a Monday afternoon, place is empty and we are missing two people from our group of 6, they make us wait outside when they can easily seat us. BYE"
"I decided to go here after reading a NY Times article about the owner of Black Dog Gelato; she said that Bite Cafe is one of her favorite spots in the city, so I decided that I had to try it. I'm very happy I did. I've been a handful of times now, and I'd give this restaurant five stars, but some of the vegetarian meals I've had have been just good, not great. I do LOVE the bi bim bop that they serve for brunch. The mixture of flavors and textures knocked my socks off. The mashbrown that they serve with most of their brunch meals is SO good. I wasn't a huge fan of their veggie burger or their black pepper pasta. The butterscotch pot de creme was delicious, but the brownie was meh because it was served cold and therefore hard; it was actually challenging to eat. My husband really enjoyed the Friday fish fry, and he's a cranky Brit who's hard to please. So like I said, the food can be hit or miss. Some have complained about the service, but it's always been quite good. They certainly don't go above and beyond, but it's not bad by any means. For the price, this place is definitely worth returning to. It's BYO, so that's another selling point. I just think you need to try out the dishes and find the ones you love and keep coming back for those."
"Yummy healthy breakfast! And they substitute tofu for eggs! Ha! Cute spot attached to the Empty Bottle. It's BYOB but you can grab coffee/a drink at the bar at the Empty Bottle. It can get busy on the weekends, but this is my first healthy yet yummy brunch visit in Chicago. The staff were awesome and friendly. The atmosphere was clean, bright, yet cozy. Prices were decent too. I had the pork hash which was good (it was salted unevenly though.) I tried the Bi Bim Bop which was delicious and spicy. Chicago lived up to it's awesome brunch reputation. Give this spot a try!"
"Always save room for dessert here.  Had the falafel sandwich and the fried halvah bread pudding tonight.  100% sure I'm going to have dreams about that dessert.  Only my second time here, but always impressed by the low key but very attentive service."
"This place is so out of the way for the downtowner me but any chance I get, I'll be back. We really loved every single thing we tried - cous cous, mac n cheese, tacos, everything! Friendly service, good selection, really cute place!"
We went for breakfast/brunch - it was pretty crowded but we got to sit at the counter which I preferred = the table seating looked a little too cozy.  Food was really good but the service was outstanding.  From where we were sitting we could see them preparing food and washing the dishes - the place is immaculate.  We will be back.
Pretty cool that it connects directly into empty bottle. A little bit on the loud side so I wouldn't recommend bringing one of those soft-talkers. Pork Hash was great!
Had dinner here last night. We came in right before the rush. Everything here seemed and looked fresh. We had a hard time figuring out what to order because of so many options. The staff was friendly but busy at times. I will definitely be back. I recommend anyone come here for a delish BYOB dinner on a casual week night.
"Probably my favorite place in the neighborhood. I stop in for lunch once in awhile and order takeout for dinner. Hangover salad is awesome as are most of their specials. Steak Night is worth it. They also do a great job with the take out, boxing the food the right way so it's not an utter mess when you get it home."
"I had the absolute pleasure of visiting this slice of heaven when I visited Chicago last week. I was referred to Bite by a close friend who immediately called me after his first visit   His words were like poetry. Poetry that makes your blood rush to all the right places.  Having come from Colorado, I know my coffee and dammit I know my breakfast. It's a right of passage. When I first walked in the door, I was welcomed with a smile which was odd due to every other encounter I had previously had with humans in Chicago. I don't know what the hell is wrong with people in that place. SMILE AND SAY HELLO FROM TIME TO TIME. It's not difficult and it was soooo refreshing to see a smiling face... Faces are sweet, BUT THAT PORK HASH WAS FUCKING BONKERS. The poached eggs were cooked perfectly and the layers that followed suited each other beautifully. What really set this bowl of orgasm off was the coffee. Robust, full and smooth like grandpa's velvet underwear. DAMN. that was a good breakfast, go to this place always if you are a decent human and not a lizard person like half of Chicago."
"Very solid. Reminds me of Birchwood Cafe, except edgier and more hip.The food is comfort-oriented, and makes you feel warm and fat and happy after eating. The scramble/hash dish, usually a special, is generally terrific. We've also had some terrific sweet bread type dishes - apple bread, banana bread, etc.There's a bar next door that I hear is great dive place called the Empty Bottle (and I think Drinking Buddies was filmed in part there?)- we haven't been, but if we're ever in the area at night will definitely go."
"Before we go any further, LOOK AT MY PHOTO. That's a Staquille O'Neal, friends. And what exactly is a Staquille O'Neal? I thought you'd never ask (okay, I knew).So here goes:It's a 'mashbrown' topped with bacon, a burger patty, cheese, egg and hollandaise. It's the Autobahn to a coronary.And, it is special... yes, special as in obviously unique but  also a sometime it's on the menu, sometimes it's not SPECIAL.My apologies for being so cap-happy, but you'd be excited too if you ate one of these (well, half anyway) and actually survived... you know?So here we are. The approving buzz from my legitimately foodie friends (here's looking at you, Erin P!) brought me to Bite. After hearing the tales of grandeur, I knew I had to get to the 'new' Bite Cafe and I also knew I needed to go on an off time to avoid fighting the frenzied throngs of foodarazzi. A blizzard-y Friday afternoon turned out to be the perfect time to snag a table in the reformed Bite. Walking in, my eyes were met with polished but charming insides including exposed brick, thoughtful art and partly vintage but mostly French blue chairs. J'adore!Since you already know this story's delicious middle, let's cut to the chase: I spent a solid fifteen minutes contemplating selections with my colleagues. Darlings, this is a serious menu and it deserves your undivided attention. But once I noticed the Staquille O'Neal scrawled on the chalkboard... well, I was a goner.I'd venture to say that I'd come back for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Well, there wasn't enough time, Michael. There just wasn't enough time.**Godfather quotes mean serious business. Eat here!"
"Looooove The Bite for breakfast. Their tofu scramble is quite good. And I've heard their ham and egg biscuit can't be beat. That mashbrown is otherworldly. Gotta say though, Eggs Duncan was THE best vegetarian breakfast dish I have ever come across. So sad to see it's no longer on the menu. Fingers crossed it makes a return some day."
"Bite Cafe is a nice little spot with a pretty good atmosphere. The menu ks fairly diverse and includes vegan food. In the experience that I had, the place had it's drawbacks. The servers were nice but their service was very slow. The fries were pretty good but where also soaked in grease. Some might enjoy their veggie burger but it was not quite what I expected. The patty was basically a giant mushroom stuffed with veggies. This is definitely a place that I would give another chance, but I'll wait until I'm prepared to spend a little bit more money on a meal than I usually would."
I try to come here at least once a week becasue the food is really that good.  I use to live 2 minutes away so it was easy to get to but now it's a 15-20 minutes away but I keep coming back because the whole family craves the food here.  They have something for everyone and they have excellent specials.  Last night we got the tofu tacos(5)the mac and cheese(4.5)and the poached tuna special whiich was easily a 5 and was so refreshing of a dish.  To top it off Bite is BYOB!!!  I wish I lived as close as I use to but I will still come back weekly!
"I really don't understand why people think Bite is so amazing. It is much better than the shitbox it once was, which gave me food poisoning once. I know they have cleaned up their act, and I cannot deny that there are a couple things they do really well, but overall it is such a meh place. I ate there last night and 1) The service was pretty bad. I cannot imagine that the servers here could possibly work in a larger establishment. Yes, the place was packed, but there are no more than 15 tables in the place, and I think its probably closer to 12. The apathy was pretty brutal.  2) The sausage risotto was gross. It looked gross when it came out (please add some herbs or SOMETHING, because cream and brown as a food color is just not appetizing) and just didn't really have flavor. Needed more parm, less sausage. It just wasn't good. My husband's poutine was fine. The oysters and grits were pretty good. The challah bread pudding was very good.This place is just *fine* at the end of the day. Definitely does not warrant an hour wait and, once again, I think its another sad case of people buying into the hype of an admittedly neat place that just doesn't have great food."
"The best thing about Bite was it's adorable and comfortable atmosphere.  The menu was interesting, but the food wasn't out of this world.  Would likely give it another chance to live up to the hype."
"This place is small but it's clean and there is plenty of parking and it has delicious coffee! I like the fact that Bite Cafe has a bunch of savory options than your typical brunch place. I ordered the pork hash and my husband ordered the Eggs Duncan. Both good, but mine was better. The pork in my dish was seasoned well and I liked that there was a good mix of carbs, proteins and veggies.  My husbands biscuit was substantial enough to hold up to the very rich gravy, and it was good but it was really rich. I would definitely come back, but my only gripe about this place is that it needs to turn up the heat!! We sat by the window which was great, but we kept our jackets on the entire time. I'm pregnant, and I'm normally hot nowadays, but even with a North Face parka on and a buncha hot coffee, my feet were still freezing!"
"Bacon gravy is terrific. All in all quite good but I gotta give the nod to Hash in a ""brunch-off"""
"My first time here, ordered take-out on a Saturday night. Falafel sandwich: falafel over cooked, chickpeas undercooked. Fries,  soggy, but crisped up nicely under my broiler at home.Mac & cheese: moist, good portion. Not much flavor though. Bland. Added bread crumbs and parmesan cheese at home which helped.Tofu taco: good flavor, but not really worth the $3.Being new to the neighborhood I really wanted to like this place.  Maybe it's better for brunch?"
"After almost a year eating around West Town, we have no doubt Bite Cafe is among the area's best restaurants.Whether brunch of dinner, Bite's cozy, relaxed atmosphere, always-changing yet familiar-feeling menu, friendly staff and all around good vibes deliver every time.The food is fresh, delicious and very fairly priced. If you bring beer or a bottle of wine to share (BYOB is an option and seems to be quite popular among Bite diners), you can easily walk away with a satisfying meal for two for under $30, which compared to many other places nearby, is a steal. A favorite of mine is the pork hash, which comes with potatoes, kale, butternut squad and a few other ingredients all tossed together, topped with two poached eggs and served atop a couple pieces of sourdough toast. They also serve Dark Matter coffee, which is great.Among Shaza's favorites is the cheddar biscuit with siracha aioli. The mashbrowns are awesome, too.If you're in the hood, check out Bite. If you're not, take a trip down Western Ave. You won't be disappointed!"
I enjoy brunch here at least twice a month.  Every dish is delish and the service is always great.  It's my go to.
"Went here for dinner after getting a Gilt City coupon. The food was AMAZING. I had a special (pot roast) and we shared the oysters. Both were insanely great. The atmosphere is cute, but a little small and squished. We ended up sitting at the kitchen bar b/c there weren't any tables. I can imagine it would be hard to get in on a Fri/Sat night. Minus one star for the location. It's kind of in the middle of nowhere, right next to Empty Bottle and seemed a little bit sketchy when we walked out late at night. Perhaps I'm just used to more of a neighborhood location."
"One of my favorite brunch spots in the city and not just because it is down the streetRecent comparison of the pork hash to the duck hash at longman and eagle resulted in a Bite win. This little gem is not to be taken lightly, the food quality is solid always - even during the week.Pork hash and chicken migas are both winners. Salmon benedict special is equally amazing. Add on the fact that it is BYOB and you've got delicious food at a phenomenal price point.  Extremely neighborhoody, warm, friendly, good service. On weekends you may wait at peak hours, however on Saturdays there is often a vintage bizarre at empty bottle next door where you and your brunch crew can wander after grabbing a drink at the bar.  Conclusion: Amazing"
"Hash was delicious. Perfect place for weekend brunch. Kind of a hipsterish crowd but employees are friendly, food surprisingly delicious, and prices relatively reasonable."
"Delicious food!Great if your Veg, Great if you are Non-Veg and if you are non-veg you should def try some of the veg options thats how good this place is!We went for brunch on a sunday and the place was packed.  We sat at the counter and our server was very helpful.  She was a little bit slower than I would have liked her to be BUT like I said the place was packed so I could understand.The food was really good!  We had biscuits with jam and butter.  For the main course I had the poutine which was really good!  The flavor combo that they created here was exquisite.  My GF had the Bi Bim Bop, another tasty dish.We will definitely be back.  Check it out people!"
"I came here early one Saturday night and was not disappointed! It's a real small place, and since it was early we had no problem getting a table for six right away.  We started with the beet salad and Fried Oysters & Grits - both were delicious.  I had the skate wing, which was very tasty.  I made sure to sample my brother's Poutine and Hangover salad which were both also excellent and pretty good portions. Everybody else at my table enjoyed their food as well and we *had* to get dessert as well.  My dad kept raving about the Dark Matter coffee (now I know what to get him for Christmas)!  The only down fall was that the service was pretty slow and they took forever and multiple times asking to fill up the waters.  I would still be sure to come back, though."
Really good brunch. Great flavors. Fresh. Interesting dishes. Nice decor. Friendly staff. Try their french toasts!
"Relaxed atmosphere, friendly staff, and delicious food. Great combination. I had the eggs Duncan-if you like cream of spinach, peas, and poached eggs, this is definitely for you. It's a good portion but if you fit it in, get a mashbrown aka mashed potatoes in hash brown form."
Best brunch in Humboldt / WOW / Ukie area.  Great for dinner as well.  BYO!
"When I think of the type of dining Chicago excels at, it's places like Bite Cafe that come to mind. Small, almost hole-in-the-wall in feel. A little bit dark inside, with a few tables and a carefully selected (and consequently, short) menu. BYOB. This archetypal restaurant takes pride in high-quality, fresh, and local ingredients, and in-house preparation.The plate size is small, which leaves room for sampling or dessert-ing. I ordered the the Black Pepper Pasta with roasted tomato sauce, squash, zucchini, oregano, goat cheese, and pepitas. It was quite tasty, but the flavors were somewhat subdued. The goat cheese was served in the corners of the plate, and without the cheese the dish was almost bland. Once I figured out how to create the perfect bite on each fork, I was happy. For dessert, our table split the Fried Challah Bread Pudding with pecans, honey, and whipped cream. It was delicious. When I split dessert with a group, I am usually very mindful of how many bites I am taking so as not to hog the dessert. At Bite Cafe, that rule flew out the window. No regrets.My party was a bit rambunctious, but the waitresses (bless them!) took it totally in stride. The service here is great. Note: They won't seat you until the entire party is present, so be gracious to your dining companions and show up on time."
"My husband and I don't get it? We shared the mussels and they were weird. Not that they mussels themselves had gone bad, just the tomato sauce they came in. How hard is it to make a sauce for mussels, we just couldn't figure it out. Also I tried my friends pappardelle, just no, it tasted strongly of balsamic (I think). The waitress situation was a pain as well. There seemed to be a lot of people running around but only 1-2 people taking orders. So we had a table of 8, we asked if we could do separate checks and the girl said it would be a hassle so we tried to give one payment with cash and cards. She..was confused so we just asked for separate checks. She gave us our 5 bills, left and then came back and took only 2 bills. We were all like she's coming back right? No she closed the bill with $40 and one credit card. Girl, come on."
"KILL ME SLOWLY WITH THAT PORK HASHnow now I've been around the brunch/breakfast block quite a few times. But I was nothing but floored with the my brunch experience at Bite Cafe. I've been scared to write this review for quite some time because honestly I don't know how words could even begin to describe how much this place picked me up in it's sweet thick labored arms and carried me into the sunset to make sweet love to every orifice of my decrepit lonely body. Aroused initially with the invitation of BYOB(no corking fee and no limit) I sat with a fine cup of coffee and an equally satisfying mimosa. Little did I know that on top of being served by the cutest babes on the planet that I would consume food that would send my body into 100% ""I'll have what she's having"" ORGASM! If my pants had not been tightly bound to my legs I would have impregnanted every set of eggs in that room! YOU SHOULD HAVE WRAPPED ME IN RUBBER SHEETS I TELL YOU! I ordered the pork hash and I have not a single regret in my mind on that decision. I wept with every bite like Adrien Brody in the pianist when the German commander brings him bread. THE PIANIST IS ONE HELL OF A MOVIE! Hard to watch at times when you feel the weight of the reality but a good pick me up for anybody living in...... One of those democracies. ANYWAYS THIS PLACE WAS GREAT it's always a little bit of a wait but FUCK IT be patient and don't bring grandma unless you know she's ok with waiting because let's be honest our elders have specific meal times that their organs need to abide by, if you screw that up well then it's your fault that your cleaning her up. But I would honestly wipe my grandma A MILLION TIMES for the experience I've had at this place."
"This place is great.  Quick and friendly service and amazing eats.  Also, I would put it at $ or just almost $$.  I had the pork hash (i think that's what it called) - it was slow cooked pork, over sourdough, with over easy eggs, and some amazing chunks of cooked apple, and other awesome stuff - - - - - aka, awesome on top of awesome."
"Places like BC are why the food scene in Chicago is the envy of the country. Without a doubt, food options in The Windy City are going to be, about, the best you'll find in the US of A. Part of what makes it so magical is the fact that good food -- really good food -- can be found in just about every neighborhood and these neighborhood spots have a feel all they're own. I was never one for hanging out much in Ukie Village. I liked it. I liked it a lot. But, I didn't think that I had the Williamsburg swagger to pull off living here. But, from tree-lined streets to cool cafes, this is your Chicago neighborhood for real cool (Pilsen never found its footing, Logan Square is Wicker Park and Bridgeport will never cede to the hipster revolution). Bite Cafe is perfect for the 'hood.To walk inside Bite Cafe is to experience it all. It's not large. There are brick walls, smallish tables, a big ol' menu board that hovers above the kitchen, an impossibly pretty brunette waitress, and, big, pretty windows that look out on to Western Ave. That's all it needs. I never made it here to eat the dinner options. I've read they're good. But, come on. You're here for breakfast brunch. You got up late. You might be a little hung over. You may be in the midst of a walk/drive of shame. Whatever the reason, you're here. You want breakfast. You do.You want fresh orange juice. Lots of places offer it but it never quite tastes the same in every resto, no? Here, the citrusy goodness will wake you up and put a smile on your face. Being so far away from orange trees and sun, I didn't question why or how such a thing was possible. I just enjoyed.You want a breakfast taco. You might think to yourself that you don't have room for it and your meal (and, you won't) but you *really* need to get it. There ain't nothing wrong about scrambled eggs, jack Cheese, black beans, and pico de gallo in a tortilla. The taco's bigger than you think. You'll eat the whole thing and be happy about it.You want breakfast poutine. Breakfast.Poutine. Any respectful person who enjoys food, sunshine, smiles from a baby, and/or breathing air won't need me to explain why this is heavenly. But for the one person who needs to understand, understand this: this is a mess on a plate. This is why you live in the Midwest -- so you can eat things like this under the cover of 6 months of winter and hide the food triplets that grow in your belly. Enjoy. Relish. Some of us live in a land of heat and sun and are shamed at our eat-like-no-one-will-see-you-naked-for-half-a-year bodies. But we regret nothing. Nothing. Why? Because of french fries, BACON GRAVY, cheese curds, poached eggs, and pickled chiles.Don't you want it?"
On a whim I found myself at Bite Cafe with a friend and what a little gem it turned out to be.  The space was nice and cozy and smelled amazing.  The brunch menu was a little overwhelming for a first timer.  I wanted to eat everything.  I asked my neighbor what he was eating because it smelled amazing and I ordered what he was having.  The Pork Hash is possibly one of the best meals I've had this year.  I can't wait to eat my way through the menu then start in in the dinner menu.
Soooooo good! The service is great and the food is to die for! I have went for brunch and dinner a few times and have never been let down.
"Some of the best food I've had in Chicago. Great burgers and they do a lot of awesome stuff with lake fish and other seafood. Portions are usually on the smaller end but not tiny and they do vary somewhat-- but I've never left hungry.I also like that of the dozen or so times I've come I've only ever had to wait more than a few minutes maybe once, which is unusual for a city renowned for long lines and ridiculous prices. BYOB. Servers are all charming."
Tried the tofu taco and the vegetarian burger. The tofu taco was a little bland for me. I liked the vegetarian burger but i wouldn't say it's to die for. Service was attentive and the ambiance is nice.
"This place can do no wrong here...I can only attest to dinners here. And each meal has been something new/unique and delicious. Everything about this place just seems to work for me....it's small and cozy, you can go next door to the bar to get a drink. The staff is helpful, nice, yet chill. The menu options seem to change often (or maybe it's because I order from the specials a lot?). Their menu is an interesting blend of upscale meets down to earth, so there's something for everyone in terms of taste and amount of money you want to spend. Except maybe your dad who doesn't like to venture outside of the box much, but screw him and don't bring him here like I did. I've had the best mussels of my life (so far) here. I could drink the broth alone....Yes, check this place out."
"I'm one of those people that doesn't dream of life after 40. I love butter, butter cream and other things derived from butter. This death sentence explains my three stars.Bite has excellent byob service, a friendly staff and a nice intimate setting. I honestly had no problem, the food is just too healthy for my taste.I had the beef stroganoff and I think it had too many mushrooms, but really it had too few calories and deadly ingredients. I wanted a creamy based pasta dish swimming in butter and low grade beef. What I got was a clean light dish that tasted fresh and like life after 40. My taste are too low brow/unhealthy for me to frequent Bite.For those of you interested in living a long healthy life Bite is for you....for everyone else I will see you over the mozzarella sticks at the bar."
All I have to say is BREAKFAST POUTINE.  It's exactly as it sounds: poached eggs over cheese curd gravy covered fries.  I won't say it was the most delicious thing I've ever had...but certainly one of the most innovative.  It was like eggs benedict but from French Canada or something.  They had biscuits and gravy too - only $5! (think it was the special for the day).  Help was very good - super friendly.  Area kind of reminded me of Greenpoint or Williamsburg Brooklyn (which made sense b/c it's in an area called Ukraine Village).  This loses a star b/c I'm not sure I have a compelling reason to return here?  Didn't mean I didn't enjoy it immensely.  But it certainly wasn't the most delicious thing I've ever had.  It was just good.  I expected to be blown out of my chair.  I wasn't.
"Staff is great, they were friendly and we just beat the morning rush so we were seated pretty quickly. The decor is clean and simple, very hipster so if that bothers you don't come. I ordered a breakfast taco which I thought was really good. I also got the biscuits and gravy which was very non-traditional they had an orangish cheesy looking sauce all over them rather than your classic white sausage gravy. It was still pretty good but nothing special, I wouldn't order them again. I also ordered a side of eggs which were cold and a bit stiff. My wife got the classic which is very difficult to mess up. She did request all bacon and still got sausage which was really a tasteless hamburger patty sized slab of meat. I cut it up in pieces and threw it in my B&G which was OK. All in all, it's sort of your run of the mill hipster breakfast joint. Prices were great, many other things on the menu looked good. The taco was excellent so I would go that route next time around. I probably should have asked about the B&G. Check it out... If I lived in this hood I would check it out on a semi regular basis..."
"5 stars for the French toast! Decadent.    Crunchy outside but soft inside.  Perfectly  sweet without being doused in syrup.  The best ever, hands down.  I will return for the French toast.  Everything else is average and the morning I visited, my platter was on the oily side."
"Breakfast was delicious and great coffee. Service was friendly and attentive. I really enjoyed the pork hash and my wife ordered the French toast which was sent out burnt for some reason. Why the kitchen would try to serve something so charred and black is very surprising. The migas was also a winner, and my son loved the apple cider. It was very loud and crowded on a late Sunday morning but we didn't wait for a table, and the severs were great. Will definitely return."
"We've been here twice after reading rave reviews of the food. We went for dinner, which was very good. We had the pork belly special and the veggie burger. We returned for breakfast since we'd heard such good things about it. The pork hash was delicious! We also tried the ham and egg biscuit with a mashbrown. Also very good! My complaint about this place is that the service is very, very slooooooowwwww! The wait staff moves with no sense of purpose. On both occasions we had several things we'd asked for forgotten. Even though the food was incredibly delicious, we have a rule that if service isn't up to par we don't return. Sorry guys. We really enjoyed your food, but the prices warrant better service. :("
Quaint but elegant atmosphere.  Trendy comfort food.  The tater tot casserole was pretty awesome.  BYOB!
"I had heard so many wonderful things about Bite, so this place was hyped up and I came there with pretty high expectations. This place lives up to its hype. Everything my friends and I ordered was delicious. So happy with this place. I tried the grilled cheese with tomato soup, gnocchi, spare ribs, mussels, tofu tacos, brownie sundae, chocolate milkshake..... It was all so good. Can't beat that it's BYOB and next to the Empty Bottle! Love this place."
"My husband and I dropped into Bite Cafe for dinner before a show at the Empty Bottle which, conveniently enough, was located right next door.  I ordered the lamb sausage with carrot/sweet potato puree and peas and my dining companion ordered a burger.  With fries.  I know.  Anyway, I thought the overall flavors of the sausage and sides were ok but I wasn't wowed.  The sausage was a bit dry perhaps and the meal itself was a little cooler than I would have liked.  And while I'm not one who cares too much about plating, I could barely suppress a little giggle when the waiter delivered my sausage.  A single cased meat on a plate.  Something about that just seemed odd. We ordered the salted caramel brownie for dessert and overall that was a 3.5/5.  You get a dense, fudgey brownie (which, although it was good, the texture of it almost reminded me of those little debbie cosmic brownies) topped with a scoop of delicious vanilla ice cream and smothered in hot fudge.Service was attentive and friendly.  Given the fact that the menu changes often, I would maybe stop back.  But I wouldn't make any special trips for it."
"5/5 goes to the apple pie bread. ABSOLUTELY DIVINE. Also, I love how accessible it is via Bus No. 49."
Dark matter coffee!!
"Délicieux! First off, I really love the decor in this place. The blue accents in the chairs and the walls really popped next to the brick wall. I really regret not having jotted down the name of the dish I ordered. It was a special of the day, but all I know is that it included pasta, mushroom, zucchini, and a whole lotta creamy, heavenly sauce smothered on top! Honestly, they could've put this sauce on top of play dough and it still would've tasted amazing.Best of all is this place is really affordable. I'll have to go back and try the poutine because these pictures are making me drool!"
"Bite Cafe should have a solid 4.5 star average rating.  I think the issue is, the reviews from years ago when it was a dive breakfast joint are still up taking the average rating down.Bite Cafe is the bomb squad for so many reasons:-A non-asian BYOB (rare)-Rarely a crazy wait-No ressies means that you can pull the last minute Saturday night dinner out-Great american/local/hipster food that is very reasonably pricedBasically if you want to do a pretty solid date night, you can hit up Bite with a killer bottle of wine and it won't set you back more than $50. One of my favorites in Chicago."
"Didn't think I'd be able to find a place that could accommodate all of my food restrictions, but they did AND it was delicious, so much so I had seconds."
"The grilled cheese and tomato fennel soup is simply delicious. Not a light meal thanks to the magnificent cheese used in perfect collaboration with the buttered bread, but well worth it! The soup was creamy and smooth, clearly pushed through a fine strainer.The BYOB was the best part about it!"
"Fearing I wasn't exactly the demographic that frequented Bite Cafe, it was never really on my radar for breakfast / brunch options, but sometimes it pays to listen to your friends who obviously know better.Angie M and I had a car wash date (we both purchased our cars at the same dealer within days of each other and they offer free washes on Sundays) and then wanted to have brunch after, and a few places were tossed around before we settled on Bite.We got seated immediately, which at 10:30 on a Sunday, is a miracle in itself. It's a cute place, not what I expected, and I was pleasantly surprised.Angie went for a basic breakfast of bacon and eggs, but I was feeling a bit more adventurous. I was waivering between the breakfast tacos or an omelet, before finally settling on the Eggs Duncan.I was very happy with my choice: two fluffy biscuits topped with creamed spinach and peas, and topped with perfectly poached eggs. It was rich, creamy, and filling, and a great combination - kind of a twist on a florentine benedict. I could have done without so many pesky peas, but overall I definitely enjoyed all the components.Service was swift and friendly, and no one batted an eye at two girls with no (visible) tattoos.I will make a point of listening to my friends more often and I will certainly give Bite another shot.3.5 stars."
"Terrible service. Long waits, servers talking at the cash register when they have plenty of people waiting for them to take orders. The server taking names for the wait was patronizing as hell. We asked where we were on the list to get an idea of timing and in the most snide voice I've ever heard, she told us we were a ""bigger party"" so it would take longer for them to get us a table..... CLEARLY we just wanted to know how many names were before us and that was it. Not be told how many people are in our party or how challenging it is to seat us. After sitting down our waitress brought us coffee with floating chunks in it, whatever bottom of their pot of coffee that's fine, but she proceeded to take the order of two other tables that got their after we had before coming to take our order. We frequent this cafe a lot because we live around the corner. The food is AMAZING and inexpensive, but the service is fucking TERRIBLE and pretty consistently terrible. Need to overhaul their serving team."
I've had quite a few awesome meals here.  The bread pudding dessert is always amazing.
Great byob place that I'll be visiting regularly! I'd give the 5th star if my waitress was a little more helpful and smiley. Solid little joint otherwise!
Super good late night kitchen! Unique food options. The Hangover Salad was flavorful and tasty which is what my friend got so I only had a bite or two. I got the Falafel pita and it was really great. It had just enough spice for my taste and the sauce wasn't too heavy. Really great for a late night meal. I went there at around 11:30 and the kitchen was open. In a bit of a random location for the ambience of the restaurant but that was another reason it was so unique. The menu wasn't conventional but it had good options.
I went here for the first time last week and will definitely be going back soon. I had the beef short rib and it was amazing! The whole dish melded together perfectly with the potato gratin and carrot puree. The restaurant was cozy. I didn't really like that we ended up basically sitting on top of the people next to us. The menu is very affordable and high quality food. Love that it is BYO.
oh!!!! I'm so glad we live so close to a yummy place as this :)There was a 30min wait on a saturday around 1. Not too bad. Plus there was a craft fair going on next door at the empty bottle. We got a funny stare when he ordered. Joel is a growing boy and needed to share 3 meals and 2 sides with me. Needless to say we left breathing heavily...also drunk cuz it's BYOB. Mimosas are a must at brunch.FOOD: Pork hash is amazing! The mix of potatoes and kale really make the dish sing. The poutine was really disappointing. It was my first time trying poutine and was really excited but I didn't like the gravy. Joel agreed and has some poutine experience. The bacon is perfection. Sausage is ok and looks like a burger pattie. Finally we tried a french toast special. It had something that looked/tasted like a version of nutella that blew my mind!!! I think the waitress said it also had a banana aun glaze. I was so full at this point but still ate my 2 slices. This is how tastey it was!service is really nice to top it off :) will be back to try more of the menu!
"What a cute, neighborhood place!  We had an a la card for this restaurant and don't live too far so we decided to try it.  So glad we did!  The food was excellent and the service was great.  I would recommend the mussels and frites for an app (good for sharing if you're in a group).  They have a lot of specials that change all the time, but when we went, I really liked the 2 specials we chose.  Their version of bi bim bop was very good - it was with wild rice, asparagus, and garlicky kimchi.  It also came with tofu and a fried egg - yum!  My husband had the monkfish which was buttery and tasted like lobster.  Everything was very good.  Plus BYOB!!  We will definitely be coming back to try the brunch.112/365"
"My fiancé and I came here for brunch. The hostess told us an hour and 15 minute wait so we went next door to Empty Bottle for a Bloody Mary. It turned out to only be a thirty minute wait before she sat us at the counter. He ordered a pork hash (butternut squash, shredded pork, kale, etc topped with a fried egg and holandaise) and I got an omelette full of veggies that came with a ""mashbrown"" and toast which she happily substituted a biscuit for no extra charge at my request. All of the food was DELICIOUS. We weren't hungover, just hungry, and it hit the spot without being too heavy. My fiancé described it as no fuss, no frills, just lets the qualify of the food shine through. The service was fine (maybe it helped that we were at the counter). I will definitely come back!"
"I would have given it a 4, but their host was just rude. And if I could I'd  give her a 2. The servers are just the sweetest. I give them a 4.9.  When I went I got the pork hash. It was good! But my friends had the French toast... Omg!!! Best French toast I've ever had!!! 4 out of 8 got it. I just kept eating theirs. lol. My mom got the poutine and that was pretty darn good as well. I've never been here before. And we all felt a bit out of place. Mostly bc the host just wasn't very nice. In a restaurant the first and last person is almost always your host. I'll say it's my fault. I brought a group of 10; 8 adults and 2 kids. It said it was good for big groups. I disagree. I wouldn't come with anything bigger than 5. Love the decor and all very cute. Love u can have BYOB and loved their servers. And the food was pretty darn good!!  Ooh and they were totally cool with splitting our checks! Love that!!"
Great byob. You can have a beer at the blind robin next door while you wait. They have pinball!
"Delicious! I had the fried oysters and grits and was basically happy just from ordering it. The food didn't disappoint! It was hopping on a freezing cold Sunday night, so the popularity seems to speak to the quality. Cozy and homey joint."
"I just love this place, it's my parents favorite place to go since Flo switched owners/management, so I come here fairly often when we go out for dinners.  The staff is down to earth, professional, friendly, and doesn't try to pull wool over the eyes with their opinions of the menu.  As a BYOB place, I really appreciate the staff's courtesy with regard to offering to refrigerate your beer if you bring a 6 pack, instead of letting it slowly get to room temperature while it sets on the table.  Diana is AWESOME (if you remember her from Twisted Spoke, you should know), as are many of the other staff whose names currently escape me. The size is quite small, and cute, so even if there are a few other tables occupied (usually there are plenty of people here, which is good!  I love Bite!) it doesn't feel like you are the only table there.  (plus did I mention the waitstaff is awesome?  They aren't all up in your grill, just perfectly attentive!).  In addition to the service being stellar, I love that the bathroom is *always* super clean, as is the kitchen (you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the toilet).  These things are wonderful, and the music they play is always fun but not in a way that will make you think you're at an Empty Bottle show.  Oh, no.The thing that I really appreciate about Bite is their menu is extremely well balanced: vegans and meatheads alike can eat here, and each course's offerings are also DAMN good.  Appetizers?  Yum.  Want a soup or salad?  Both will be good (soup changes daily).  Entree?  Tasteeee!  The desserts are evil, and as a recovering cookie monster, I mean that in the best way possible.Some of my dinner favorites include:Curried tofuPork shank (they don't offer this all the time, though they SHOULD, because it is love on a plate!)Gnocchi (the pasta is like biting into a cloud, and comes with plenty of veggies)the Chickenpumpkin custard/flanspring rollsBite is a solid performer with dinner and also with brunch.  I've yet to come here for  lunch, but that is just a matter of time."
"Delicious!I've eaten both breakfast and dinner here and the food is awesome! I ate the mussels and fries and I cannot wait to go back, I seriously have been thinking about them all week.  Prices are very reasonable- about 12-15ish per entree.The atmosphere is cute- great date spot and/or casual dinner with friends.  I haven't had to wait long for a table yet, although I have not been here on a Fri or Sat night.I almost don't want to post this review because it seems to be kind of a neighborhood gem for the time being.  Can't wait to go back!"
"I recently stayed in Ukrainian Village on a road trip to Chicago, and Bite Cafe - recommended highly by a local resident - was by far one of my favorite spots in the neighborhood.  If I lived there I would probably come here every day.  A warm brick and wood interior decorated with chalkboards, photographs and cute blue wooden chairs, Bite embodies the trendy but cozy feeling of its surrounding neighborhood.For brunch, my friend and I both ordered the Lemon Ricotta Stuffed French Toast, two slabs of french toast heaven with tangy ricotta cheese centers and a lemony aftertaste perfect for the warm weather.  As luck would have it, they also served Dark Matter coffee which we had become acquainted with at the nearby Star Lounge.Our waitress was fantastic and immediately made us feel at home, offering recommendations of other places to visit on our maiden voyage.  When I'm back in town a trip to Bite Cafe will definitely be on the itinerary."
"It is a cozy little cafe that is amazing for being BYOB.  The baby blue chairs accent the unassuming and comfortable little cafe.  I really went because of the menu though, one item in particular.  The pork hash.  The pork shoulder was braised to be very tender and had the nice bite of a bit of vinegar that I love in a pork shoulder.  It reminds me of when my great grandmother made pork shoulder.  Two of my favorite vegetables also made an appearance in the hash, kholrabi and brussel sprouts.  When you top everything with the spicy hollandaise, you end up with a dish of pure bliss.  The menu describes a crispy sourdough that accompanies it but the toast being under the mounds of hash doesn't remain crisp.  This is not to say that the toast isn't tasty as a matter of fact I do like it being underneath to soak up the hollandaise sauce an runny egg yolks.  The crowning achievement of the place was the mashbrown.  It is one of those taste to believe it things but I think it  is one of the best hashbrowns I've ever tasted.  It is crisp and  has creamy mashed potatoes on the inside and a nice bit of onion flavor from scallions."
"We went for a late breakfast/brunch at 11:00 on a Sunday and found that this very busy place had about a half hour wait.  We were invited to wait in the room outside the theater venue that had a pool table and a few pin ball machines. After what seemed like a shorter wait we had a delightful server who explained some of the very interesting offerings.  We chose the pork hash and the French toast, both of which were different and excellent.  Of course, the side of bacon had something to do with it also. We were surprised that it took a along time to get our food, especially when a table who came in before us was served first.  Because of the apparent screw up, we received apologies and half off our bill. I am not taking that into consideration, because the food was so good and interesting I will keep it on the list to return and keep it at four stars."
"Came here for brunch because of the reviews, but found it to only be okay.  It was a little far (coming in from Gold Coast) taking the bus, but thought it would be worth it as long as the food lived up to the reviews.  We waited for quite some time (probably 30-45 minutes) because the place was rather small, but on the plus side, they had an adjoining room where you could wait inside out of the freezing cold (the actual dining area has very limited space).  We waited a little longer than usual for our waitress to finally come and greet and take our order.  I ordered the Benedict which was okay.  It was also cold with only the poached eggs being warm.  The presentation and overall taste was good, and while I'm not opposed to eating it without meat, it would have been nice to have it the traditional way (with either ham or salmon).    I suppose a Vegetarian would have appreciated it more than I did.  My friend ordered the omelette special - it also did not have any meat in it - and it was pretty good.  Both of our dishes came with a ""mashed brown"" which was good.  In addition to the omelette, my friend also ordered a side of biscuit and gravy (bacon gravy).  Not good at all.  The gravy was not only not gravy, it wasn't even good I'm afraid.  The biscuit itself wasn't very good either.  It was a bit tasteless and wasn't flaky.  Being from the South, I know a good biscuit when I taste one.  We both ordered coffee and it too wasn't very good coffee.  While the french toast looked really good - something I should have ordered instead - I don't know if I'll make the trek to Bite Cafe again simply because the food (overall) was only mediocre with a lot of other brunch places that are quite good that are much closer into the city."
"Well, I am not a hipster.  However, I enjoy potatoes molded into hockey pucks.Exhibit A: Mashbrown.  It's a hockey puck, only it's hashbrowns.  And it's crunchy, which is an absolute must for this hashbrown snob.The coffee was strong enough to make me anxious.The breakfast tacos are the perfect size and they come with a side of guac...I ordered one to complement my mashbrown and my biscuit.  The combo was perfect.  I enjoy ordering a la carte for brunch :)I think I can tolerate the hipsters enough to come back.  I mean, the non-breakfast items look amazing too.Annnnnd lastly, I didn't order this but my brunch mate told me it was incredible: I forget what it's called but it's poached eggs, peas and cream spinach over a biscuit.  It was my second choice!I took away one star for the hipsters specifically."
"This place is awesome!  Went for lunch on a Saturday. It was an hour wait time. They told us we could go next door to the Empty Bottle, a dive bar, and could order from the full menu.  We thought, why not...it's quite a different style place but if you are going for the food, go for it!  We ordered the bacon poutine and the pork hash. Both were absolutely delicious!  Great food."
"What a pleasant dining experience.  The food was excellent, the menu varied (lots of options for veggies) and the wait staff was superb.  We asked our waiter for rec's and he made some great ones.  Loved everything we ate.  Can't wait to go back.  We did brunch but I would totally go back for any other meal!"
"Love the cute neighborhood vibe of this spot - cozy decor & nice service. The food is amazing!  Bite Cafe has this magical menu - we went with a vegetarian and a meat lover and everyone left  happy.  There are at least 3-4 vegetarian entrees to choose from (try the Parisian gnocchi with mint pesto!) and 5-6 non-veggie choices (goat ragu, beef short rib and trout were all divine!).  Everything came with fresh veggies. Huge fan of th chickpeas, cherry tomatoes and aspargus that came with my trout.  We were fans of the fried mussels & grits and the smoked pork belly to start. Best part?  Super reasonable for the delicious flavors and fresh ingredients. For five people, we ordered 4 appetizers and 5 entrees and it came out to less than 30 a person including tax and tip!"
Uhhmazing. Writing a review so I remember to come back. So good I licked my plate clean. If you are looking for an absolutely amazing brunch - go here.
"Like the four stars says: ""Yay!  I'm a fan.""  It couldn't be more true for Bite Cafe.My friend and I hadn't seen each other in months so we decided to meet up for dinner in her neighborhood.  I'm glad she suggested Bite because it was the perfect place.  We sat down and looked over the menu.  It's the type of place where there aren't a ton of options which means what they do have is really good.  I went with the grilled cheese and tomato soup and added bacon which is always a good choice.  I bet the grilled cheese is great on it's own but adding the bacon takes it to another level.  My friend got the burger and added a fried egg and bacon.  It was huge and looked awesome.Hopefully I won't have to wait until the next time I see my friend try Bite again."
"Yay. I went to bite cafe for brunch Saturday.I had some delicious biscuits and gravy with bacon. I got a gigantic cream cheese poundcake for dessert! my friend got eggs duncan which was : House Biscuits Topped with Creamed Spinach and Peas with Parmesan, Fresh Herbs, and Two Poached EggsTHERE WAS SO MUCH CREAMED SPINACH AND PEAS. prices were super reasonable. had a great time would love to go back."
Best BYOB I've been to in years. What a pleasant surprise. How do I justify five stars? It's a hole in the wall that specializes in some classic dishes with a twist. Bite Cafe is outstanding at what it does. You won't be disappointed or broke when you leave. You don't have to be overpriced or the super chef du jour to be great.
"Long-time resident of the neighborhood, I ate at the original Bite frequently.  Good, reliable food.  When the revamped Bite opened, with its poorly designed sign that makes the ""B"" resemble the number 13, I thought I'd give it a shot.  The food was pretty good, though for the life of me I cannot remember what we ate due to the toxic service we received.  It was busy, so customers were pretty packed in.  We were in the middle of the dining room, at a table for four.  Our waitress, who seemed to be in hell...she radiated misery, kept bumping our heads with her elbow every time she raced passed us.  No apologies, or even an acknowledgement that she made contact with one of our craniums.  After an hour of this, we nudged our table three inches to the right.  The waitress in the adjoining station then proceeded to yell at our waitress within earshot of everyone for not controlling her guests.  We got dirty looks from our server the remainder of the evening.Now, I returned recently.  My partner and I were having a Valentine's day dinner early, since he was to be out of town on the actual date, and we didn't feel like driving anywhere.  We thought we'd give Bite another chance, and we're glad we did.  It was a Tuesday night, so the restaurant was only half full.   Our server was warm and attentive, even though it appeared she had the same amount of tables that our server had on our first visit.  Our appetizer was the fried oysters and grits...a bit paltry even for an appetizer, and with under-salted grits.  Our main courses were astoundingly good.  The beef cheek pot roast was amusingly presented shredded and pre-tossed with roasted carrots and onions.  It was succulent without the oppressive fattiness that can sometimes mar a traditional pot roast.  My partner had the skate wing, prepared properly, and as delicious as any higher-priced restaurant we've been to (one of us usually orders skate wing if it's on a menu).  We normally skip dessert, but we ordered the bread pudding.  Perhaps the best bread pudding I've ever had.  Served hot, with a light crispiness and a velvety, eggy interior.  Instead of the obligatory gooey, tooth-rotting bourbon sauce, it was topped with fresh whipped cream.  The light sweetness of the cream balanced the bread pudding nicely.  Great meal, great service.  I won't wait another year to return."
"I'm super serious about this five-star rating. I've been here three times. If you're going with a group of 3-4 people, there's not much better. At least in Ukrainian Village. Brunch is bomb. Dinner is dank. Had the lemon ricotta stuffed french toast the other and Great Odin's Raven it was delish. I also had the burger in a previous visit, also amazing.I'm a fan of how they seem to wait tables here too; they aren't overly friendly but they are attentive. But that's just my preference. One complaint- the art on the walls right now are a bunch of close up photographs of marble, or granite, or something. not a huge fan. Oh yeah, and empty bottle is next door."
"Between the grilled cheese & soup entrée and The Classic brunch entry (bacon, sausage, eggs, ""mashbrowns"" and perfect-toasted sourdough toast with jam), I was plenty full and very happy.  Then the chocolate milkshake came out and my love blew into the stratosphere.  The space is intimate and just right for a neighborhood diner, but it's got some charm and a friendly staff.  Prices were very fair and the portion size was huge (normal for Chicago).  The mashbrown and I will be hanging out again, and since Bite is open late I know where I can get my last-minute milkshake close to home.  Fabulous!"
Best breakfast place in Chicago! Jointed together with the Empty Bottle. They are a cafe with BYOB and a wonderful little atmosphere. The staff is nice and the service is quick. They are vegan and vegetarian friendly too. I would recommend trying the tofu tacos.
"""Tuesday- Fried Chicken and Forties""REALLY?"
"Canada has given us so many wonderful things. Hockey, Alanis Morissette (totally hot), Neil Young, Michael J. Fox, Jennifer Tilly (totally hot in a slutty sort of way) and my new favorite, Poutine!! For those who don't know what I'm talking about, Poutine is a deliciously-messy concoction of French Fries, cheese and Gravy. The Bite Cafe takes this heart-clogging masterpiece to another extreme by creating the Poutine breakfast. This artery clogging meal includes a pouched egg, home fries and cheese covered with a deliciously, fattening gravy. I devoured everything on my plate. Hell, I even considered licking the plate clean.  The bite cafe is a cute little eatery. The decor features dark wood trim and brick walls. There is also some odd looking art on the walls, presumably created by local artists. But who cares about art when you have a plate filled with Eggs, taters and Gravy. That's all the art I need.  Here's the bottom line: The Bite Cafe is the perfect place to go to raise your cholesterol level. Come for the great service, cozy decor and hipster art, stay for the delicious Poutine. It's just what the doctor ordered."
"I have but three words... pulled pork hash! I have tried hash at most brunch spots but this one shines above all the rest. Roasted corn, onions, peppers combined with pulled pork. All served on top of a slice of buttery brioche. Top that with poached eggs and spicy hollandaise sauce. I'm still licking my lips.  Amazing pumkin chocolate bread, too! Coffee was marginal at best. My only complaint was being seated by the window. The there was such a draft that I had to wear my coat to keep warm. Will definitely be back."
"I love this attractive little restaurant with its brick wall and cozy atmosphere. This is a great place to go for a tasty dinner without breaking the bank.  The prices are reasonable, and the menu is full of delicious options for everyone, including vegetarians.  The last time I was there, all 5 of us ordered a variety of foods and tasted them all-there wasn't a bad thing on the table. If you are a grilled cheese lover, they have the best one I have ever tasted.  The place is very small, but you are welcome to wait at The Empty Bottle next door if there is a line.  The restaurant is often full, but I felt the staff was as attentive as they could be, considering all they had to do, and they were all very friendly and pleasant.   Definitely put this on your list of places to try!"
"Ordered busquites w butter n jam, pork hash benedict wo pork. It was drained in the hollandaise sauce n tasted delicious!"
"Haven't been here in years.  Went back last night with a large party, and I'm glad to see that the menu has evolved to be a little bigger and a little better.  It's a small place, so I appreciated they were able to accommodate us.This place has lovely food at reasonable prices.  Definitely worth going here once or twice if you're in the area."
dat poutine doe
"A VERY solid BYOB restaurant (no corkage fee, yay!). Great service, good food... I was sold!Bite Cafe has a very cute interior - kind of a shabby chic look to it. Like most BYOB places, it is pretty small, though they were willing to accommodate a party of 10 (though we ended up changing to be a party of 6). Service was great even after we told her we had a restaurant.com certificate. Our server came right over to open our wine and give us a run down of the menu/specials. The menu has an overall comfort food theme - but scaled up a notch. I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The grilled cheese was excellent - Sourdough, Wisconsin Cheddar, Smoked Gouda, Provolone, Cured Tomato - yes please! The soup was good as well, though pretty standard. Oh, and the Mom's mac and Cheese was also a tasty treat that we all shared to start. While it didn't blow my mind, it was definitely good.Others in my party ordered the gnocchi, duck leg special, and short rib - all met with positive reviews.I most definitely want to make my way back here and would recommend this as a top BYOB destination in Chicago."
"I almost hesitate to write this review because I don't want you to go there, really. I love that I can walk in to this place on Saturday at noon and I don't have to wait an hour.All the things Bite Cafe does well are musts for my brunch spots. Great coffee. Automatic refills of water. Fast Service. A warm ambiance is another plus.I tried the black bean burger yesterday and the flavor was great, although I would have liked it a little crispier. It was served with a huge stack of fries and who can argue with that? I can't wait to try their dinner menu."
"Hello my new brunch friend...you definitely delivered on everything that I thought you wouldnt...hahaSo after my heartbreaking experience at Lula's...I went here with a friend.  I was slightly turned off when we got in there.  The staff is that hipster, artsy, ""I dont care"" attitude.  We were motioned to a table and barely were asked what we wanted to drink.  A couple of minutes later...no explanation of menu, specials etc.  Oh, we received a motion of the hands toward the board where the specials were listed.  HAHA.  When I couldnt decide what I wanted, I asked the server and he did help me decide....a little redeeming quality there....Service overall, 3.5 starsHello plate of pork hash...this was pure insanity on the plate.  Oh heaven...so much for my health kick.  It had huge chunks of pulled pork, poached eggs, brussels, potatoes, toast...sauce...oh man, it was good.  I would HIGHLY recommend it to anyone...that, of course, remotely likes the items above.  I ate the whole thing...the entire plate was gone before I left.The coffee was pretty tastey and they were good about refilling that and the water so props to them on that.The bathroom is in the kitchen so it makes it an obstacle course to go potty...not to mention a race to beat the boy to it first...hahaAlso, an FYI...there were a lot of kids in here when we got there so had to try to tame the F*** bombs as much as I could...give me a break, I was hungover.Price point...well from what I remember most of the items on the regular items were like $9-12...not horrible....go check it out and definitely get the pork hash."
"Went here because it's BYOB and per a friend's recommendation. I ordered the pork shoulder steak special and I did not like it. It was really tuff and didn't have much flavor. My girlfriend, however, ordered the trout special and it was really good. The decor was fun and lively. Definitely liked the vibe. The wait wasn't too long and they told us how long we had so we went down a block and had a drink at this dive bar. I am going to give this place another shot because it's BYOB. I think I just ordered the wrong menu item."
"This place is awesome!  They have a fairly small, but delicious regular menu and a variety of daily specials that always look great.  The staff is super friendly, down to earth, and they work their butts off.  Cozy layout, great coffee (Dark Matter from Star Lounge), rotating wall art, nice little nook in the Ukrainian Village.Personal favorites on the menu: pork hash, daily special bread/pound cake, grilled cheese, and shakes/malts.If you haven't been there yet, I would recommend going in 3...2...1...now."
"Freakin love Bite for lunch early in the week -- never a wait for a table, friendly staff, and delicious menu. Breakfast tacos and the tofu scramble are always excellent, and the recent addition of migas to the menu is crave worthy."
"Initially the waitress told us we had to wait 20 minutes and suggested us to go to the other room if we wanted drinks oR coffee while we wait. When we walked into the other room; there was a heavy scent that immediately made me sick. I think it was because that's where the bathroom was located at. Good thing is that we were seated in about 5-10 minutes instead of the 20 minutes she originally said we had to wait. We were greeted immediately upon seating. I got the Pork hash because it was the most recommended dish here on Yelp and my boyfriend got the breakfast poutine. We were both very satisfied with our meal! They did a good job in refilling our drinks whenever it was low and their service was good even though it was really busy when we went. The place is a little small but that's no problem. Not sure if it's right to give it a four star because the meal & service was amazing but the room next door is kind of creepy and dirty which can be very unappealing. Other than that, I'd give this place a 5 star!"
"I've only been for breakfast/brunch to be fair. But I LOVE this place. Helps that its right around the corner from my apartment. Mashbrown is where its at. Also, they have changing daily specials that are always pretty interesting. And its BYOB no corkage, hello!! If you forget your libations you can buy something at Empty Bottle next door. It isn't a huge place and can get super packed on the weekends. Can't say I didn't warn you. But hey you can wait it out at empty bottle."
"This is my new favorite restaurant in Chicago. Honestly, I'm shocked that it doesn't have 5 stars, as the quality of food for the price is a serious steal. The menu is full of offerings that are rich, delicious and interesting...and they serve large portions that occasionally warrant leftovers (always a bonus). The dinner menu boasts outstanding options all under $20 -- and honestly, I would happily pay $5+ more for any of the things that I have tried.  But don't test me on that. Whatever the heck they do to the gnocchi is unreal -- it was the best gnocchi I have ever tasted. The last time I was here they had a prix fixe meal for $20 (might only be on Sunday nights), so yeah, you want to check this place out. There can be a bit of a wait, but for a BYOB restaurant of this caliber, it is totally worth it. A great place for smaller groups. Can't wait to come back to try the brunch menu too."
"I seriously don't get why this spot has been on Chicago Magazine's Hot List twice...this is the only reason I went.  I visited for brunch and had a bottle of bubbly with me.  They came over...said we had to open our own bottle...this is fine.  They offered wine glasses...and mine was covered in a film that looked as if the glass had been attacked in the dishwasher by flakes of oatmeal (I asked for a new glass...they were very apologetic, but I would have preferred that they look at it before they give it to me as it was clearly visible).  However, they don't have ice buckets...or ice and a plastic bucket, or anything resembling a way to keep wine cold...this is a miss for a BYO spot in my opinion.The food was only ok....I had a breakfast sandwich and it was ok, but nothing special.  I picked it because the waitress told me it was the best thing on the menu. It was good, I ate it, but I wasn't overwhelmed.  I am trying to remember the other dish I tried, but I can't.  I remember only wanting to try one bite, so it wasn't the most fabulous thing either.The spot is rather cute, but was empty when I was there.  I can see it being nice at night if it's lit properly.  The waitress was nice, but not really around, and considering that it wasn't that crowded, I would have thought we'd have a bit more attentive service.  The food also took forever to prepare - we were basically done with our wine by the time it made it to us!Overall, I wouldn't make the trek here for only ok food.  I was just very not impressed.  Perhaps this is because of all of the hype - I had really expected perfection."
"This is our new favorite breakfast/lunch place!  We had the pork hash and turkey sandwich, and both were terrific.  Can't wait to try dinner!"
Love the pork hash. Love the biscuits and gravy. Love the breakfast pouttine (sp?) can never be bad when a spot down the block is byob. Milkshakes and French toast are bomb especially at midnight after a day of partying. Servers are friendly and knowledgable too. Perfect hours.
"Bite is a good spot to take out of towners to brunch when you're in a pinch. Say, you forgot to make a nice reservation somewhere epic, like the Bristol or Lula. Bite accommodates a lot of types of palates, but food is on the heavier side. Enjoy the poutine if you're starving, try a special if you're not. Service is great, and the Dark Matter coffee is pretty good, too!"
"Whenever I have friends from out of town come to visit I take them here. It's walking distance from my house and the wait is never ridiculously long. If you do find yourself waiting tho, pop into the Empty Bottle (opens at 11am) and get yourself a Bloody Mary. They'll come get you when your seating is ready."
"Over the last couple of weeks I've been here with a group of 7 and then with a group of 3. They don't have large tables so on my initial visit we had to sit cozily together with a chair at one end. No matter, the quiet and laid back vibe was good. But don't let the small floor fool you.The food was pretty good each time. The pork chop, beef pasta, and strip steak were my favorites. Also, their soups are good. The burger is just ok. I'd skip the fish-n-chips. One thing was, my wife requested a well-done steak but it wasn't cooked to order. We had the waiter send it back with no hassle and it came back as such. That was the only hiccup on my two visits.The service is good. It's a small place but with the waiter/waitress combo they have to work briskly when the place is full or almost full like on the days I was there. The kitchen is pretty quick with turning around the orders so even with near capacity seating the wait time is very good.Will keep on my list of places to revisit."
"I'm always very happy with the food when I come to Bite. The pork hash was really delicious. Good service, too."
"Super reasonable prices for semi gourmet food. The food is really good and service is a bit ""brief"" but ok. Quiet and comfortable and welcoming home feeling. Been here a few times when going to the bottle and always pleased. Large portion of Pork belly for cheap!"
"Small, casual, eclectic menu, BYOB. They do a few main dishes very well. I've been here twice and each time I asked the waitress for a recommendation and I have yet to be let down. Waiting for a table at the bar next door probably isn't everyone's cup of tea but it suited me just fine."
"Ate here a few days ago with some friends. We had the duck leg and gnocchi, which were awesome. Tried the macaroni and cheese and loved it! Reasonably priced food, great environment & cool staff."
"A friend recommended this place to me and it was somewhat close to home, so I had to try it.It's a cute cafe-style place with delicious menu and changing daily specials. I wouldn't go here for a fancy date night, but if you want a casual no-fuss atmosphere and no lines to wait in and good food, this is the place for you.The only slight downside is it's BYOB, however directly next door, there's a place where you can buy bottles of wine and drinks... Some nights are 1/2 off bottle of wine nights."
"Love this place, been coming here for a few years now.The servers are extremely nice - and fast as hell given how crowded the place usually is.Menu is splendidly diverse and the milkshakes are damn fine."
"We were visiting friends on the west side and were looking through yelp to find a place to eat. We needed one that was on the cheaper side. So a few places popped up. The one we were going to go to didn't take credit cards so kept looking then I found Bite Cafe, food sounded good they took credit cards and wasn't expensive. The only problem according to Yelp was that it was no good for kids. We said, screw it our baby is pretty well behaved. We went in, looked over the menu. I had the Mussels and Fries my wife had the parisian gnocchi and for the 16 month old we got the mac and cheese. The food was all perfect. The 16 month old all had bites of our food she had 3 mussels and some gnocchi..you know I could go into detail about how amazing it was but let me again just say, perfect. It was the dessert of Fried Challah Bread Pudding though that made the meal. It was so damn good it made me mad. Mad how good it was, mad that I shared with my wife and daughter, mad that I didn't order another, mad that I don't know the next time we'll go into chicago so that I can have it again. Either way Bite Cafe will be a place we go probably every time we go into chicago."
"I enjoy Bite for what it is, a decent place for a quick breakfast.  There's a definite lack of consistency issue with the food, but I've never had the staff treat me poorly, but maybe that's just because I have tattoos or because I exude my status as a UKV resident.Bite is generally excellent for brunch, and so-so for dinner.  Breakfast foods are creative and well-prepared, and I would say that no matter what your preference, you'll probably be able to find at least one thing on the menu that you'll like.  (However, I'd say there's a chance you'll see ONLY one thing you'll like...not a lot of options.)  I definitely have to recommend the mashbrown--but be careful once you get it, because the thing is frickin' hot on the inside.I've always been impressed with Bite's daily specials--they tend to have some really great creations on the board, so make sure to check it.However, dinner is always a crapshoot.  I've ordered a burger, cooked medium, and received it raw and cold on the inside, but charred on the outside.  Completely disgusting.  On the other hand, I had a tofu stir fry in peanut sauce that was outstanding. My friends have also had similar up-and-down experiences here.I love Empty Bottle, and the BYOB/next-door drinks system is pretty sweet.  And as I mentioned, I like the people here, and they've never been anything but friendly to me."
"Super good! Something unique and crazy tasty: a house-cured fish (anchovie?) salad that had asparagus, sweet peas, and a poached egg. This was very very good! I originally decided to come b/c I was on the search for Chicago's best tuna melt & heard theirs was a contender. Alas, their menu rotates so they did not have a tuna melt at the time, but overall everything was great and service was awesome. If you know where to find a good tuna melt in chicago can you please tell me???!!! Tunaaaaaaaa meeeeeeeelt"
"A BYOB non-Asian place? Awesome. Amazing food and extremely reasonably priced as well? Extra awesome! Also helps that they are walking distance to the Division Street strip of bars for some nightcaps after! I got the Pork sausage risotto with bruscetta water and apples...such a delightfully sweet, tangy and rich combination! Our appetizer was the mussles, or, the deliciously addicting pistachios of the sea, overflowing with flavor, complete with bread to soak up that leftover flavor juice!  I tried my friend's beef tongue sandwich and that was equally as tasty. Also, DO get the bread pudding for dessert. A flavor assault on your mouth! Bite Cafe just proves my theory once again that you definitely don't need white tablecloths and a pretentious staff to have a fabulous meal around here! Still dreaming about my food a day later, and our whole table of 6 was extremely satisfied! So excited I got my friends in the know with this place, now I have people to bring next time I want to try their new menu options!   Definitely a hidden gem in the city! Coming back here again and again to try their new stuff, as their menu changes frequently. 4 stars because they won't seat you until the whole party is there and I was getting a bit nervous because half our group was running late and I was anxiously watching the tables fill up with smaller groups. No reservations but if you know what time they start to get busy you're fine. (Which I will not disclose here because I don't want to give away one of my fave places and have other people catch on!) :) Fabulous as usual! Edited to demand that you also try the poutine with bacon gravy. Thank me later! That is all!"
"First time at Bite, a few days ago. The breakfast poutine was great! It sounded like a carb overload but my husband ordered it and it was absolutely delicious. He had the mushroom gravy option. I had the tuna melt and was equally as pleased. We're happy to have another great restaurant to take out of town guests to, to enjoy Chicago as a local!"
"Vegetarian poutine! Parisian gnocchi was really good as well. It's been a while since I've been to Bite Cafe. I really like the renovations. Place looks great and the menu is still fantastic. Reasonably priced upscale diner food. I'm a fan. Lots for vegetarians and meatetarians as well. BYOB and purchases through Empty Bottle make it a great place to get grub anytime, even late!"
Excellent meal served by a wonderful chef and staff.  Great local food.  Great wait staff and fun ambiance.
"My boyfriend and I moved to Ukranian Village last week and I had my eye on BITE as our new walkable brunch location since we scoped out our now new home! Sunday I mumbled something like ""food gimme now ... walk... brunch...BITE."" and we found ourselves quickly inside the cozy dining room that is Bite.The decor reminds me of a small old schoolhouse and had a very comfortable midwest feel. The menus are in vintage children books which I thought was adorable and clever. The wait staff are very easy going but definitely prompt. I think you have to want to sit and enjoy your company and give a thumbs up to the ever flowing coffee, not expect 5 star service. Its brunch- just enjoy it!I got a breakfast sandwich with the BEST potatos on the side. The boy got a breakfast burrito that came out with a KNIFE stuck into it, which I assume is always a good sign. Both of us devoured our meals and left very comfortable. Definitely in between the I could go on with my day OR take a nap state.I was absolutely satisfied with my experience at Bite. The only thing that would make it better would be for alcohol service INSIDE instead of walking to and from Empty Bottle. But apparently in the evening its BYOB? (thx, yelpers)I'm stoked to have found my new brunch home."
"There is seriously something wrong with you if you don't think Bite is 5 stars. I would give it 10 if I could.I always get the specials and they are always amazing. I literally have never had a bad thing there. When in doubt, I get the hangover salad (no bacon) and the gnocci. The dessert always makes me cry a single tear because it is so good. There was this server there, she is blonde and has tattoos.. she was really horrible and miserable. But I haven't seen her so I go back to giving Bite 5 stars! It's BYOB.. you can't go wrong! We always get the two same servers for dinner and brunch, they are awesome. There is one server there that has blonde hair (not the one I previously mentioned) that seems to always be in a tizz.. She always seems like she is super busy and in the weeds and at times it gives me anxiety and I can't enjoy my food because I see her darting past and looking stressed. But, like I said.. we always get the same servers, at brunch it's the spunky girl with the short afro and then at dinner it's the cool chick with the dark hair and glasses. For Brunch- breakfast poutine or I get the biscuits and gravy with an egg and fries. So good! I go next door for a ketel and OJ.For Dinner- Always get the specials. They're always great. Bring your own wine! and if you forget they sell bottles next door for $20. Not bad!oh and always.. ALWAYS.. get dessert. Too good."
"Have always been meaning to try this place for brunch, but was walking by in the evening and decided to try dinner.  We were seated right away (7pm on a Friday night... luckily, because about 20 minutes later, there was a line).  The hubs ordered the Friday night fish fry.  The fish fry was tilapia, light, moist, and flaky.  It wasn't an oily dense mess like at other places.  you could taste the spices in the batter, it was still crispy, and the fish was fresh.  Delicious.  I ordered the rainbow trout, in an indecisive whim.  I was skeptical when it arrived, with the skins on.  I thought this would give it a fishy taste.  But the whole dish was fabulous.  Nice fresh fish, 2 generous filets.  A fresh corn, arugula and cherry tomato salad with bacon vinaigrette.  It was like I was eating summer.  hahahaIt was BYOB but the hubs was able to go to the bar next door, which was connected to the restaurant and grab a refreshing beer.  Next time I'd like to try the grilled cheese with tomato soup and the mussels with frites. I would have given it 5 stars, if we didn't feel so rushed to get out of there.  But I guess I get it... it was busy."
"Wow. Things change and sometimes they become just as good as or better. From 97-99 Bite was our neighborhood joint, only a few blocks away. We ate here every Sunday and probably twice a month for dinner. I still crave the potato pancakes made in a waffle iron or the spinach and cream cheese chimichangas and I actually cook a version of their orecchiette and broccoli once in a while. But that was THEN. NOW- We were visiting Chicago and in the neighborhood to see our old landlady and went for dinner. Totally different menu of course and a bit different vibe, but okay fine. Greg got the veggie burger and it was house made or pretty darn good if not. I got the special of mixed sautéed vegetables with smoked eggplant, almonds and sambal over couscous. This was an amazing mix of textures- fluffy, crunchy, creamy and tastes- sweet, smokey, salty, spicey. I like one pot meals and this was a big, hot, tasty bowlful that hit the spot and my senses, which I needed after a long tiring  day of sightseeing and museum going. It was weird that they were out of clean regular sized glasses so Greg got his iced tea in a teeny juice glass. But we just laughed about it, snapped a picture and enjoyed being back at an old haunt."
"Bite Cafe has a small but well-done breakfast menu with excellent items such as pulled pork hash and mashbrowns. For a bread lover like myself, the top item is their biscuit. IT IS AWESOME. I always order one but may order a whole plate of them next time.This cafe has a pleasant atmosphere and nice employees. It is a standard on my breakfast rotation."
"The tomato fennel soup I had here, I think I could have smeared it on my face and I wanted to just drink a gallon of it.Our server was too cool for school."
"Outstanding atypical breakfast! Cozy spot in an unlikely spot in Ukrainian Village.We didn't have to wait more than 10 minutes @ 10 on a Saturday morning but I would have waited longer. Yummy comfort food (eggs benedict with creamed spinach and peas on, I think, cornbread), and a very friendly staff. I'll be back!"
Had the chicken...amazing. desserts were also some of the best I've ever had. Definitely going back.
I wanted to like this place but I'm not sure if I got an off night or what. I'll start with the food first. My gf and I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and a burger. Simple enough sandwiches. The pulled pork was all right (not sure if $11 alright) but decent. The burger was completely overcooked. The outside was charred and tough and it was not juicy at all. This is important to note because our waitress asked if medium was all right for the burger when she took the order. This brings me to the service which is what really brought down my review from a 2 star to a 1 star. Walking in the waitress that was supposed to be acting as a hostess continues her personal conversation with her staff friend. It was not until my gf interrupted her that she acknowledged her and we took our seats at the counter. About 5 minutes go by and we get no water or menus. So we get up and get our own menus. About 7-8 minutes go by after that and the other waitress notices we haven't ordered. I ask for no salt on my fries and at this request she seems taken aback and/or offended. Ok. We still don't have any water and two girls walk in and sit right next to us to which the male waiter IMMEDIATELY brings them glasses for their wine and water. Ok. About 5 minutes after that we get our water and menus (wtf?) from the other waiter who seems surprised that we've already ordered. I don't normally write reviews this long if I don't have to but I feel it's essential to explain the complete disorganization of the staff at the restaurant at the time we went. Everybody working there really seemed like they didn't want to be there. I get that. But at least fake a smile or something. Definitely not making a return trip EVEN if it's connected to the Empty Bottle. Please go somewhere else.
"Bite Cafe....  Unfortunately I didnt get a bite. The website nor signage stated that the restaurant would be closed for an hour (4-5 ) for dinner switch over.  Maybe I will try again  Bite Cafe update your web pages to reflect changes of these ""winter hours""..A wasted drive..."
"After salivating over Bite's specials that have posted daily for the past forever, I finally made it in. After waiting only a few minutes, my gal pal and I were seated and perusing the menu. We must've changed our minds 10 times before finally choosing our meal for the night. I blame it on Bite. They could at least make SOMETHING I don't wanna eat.We started with the veggie egg rolls. I wasn't wowed, but my friend was. She LOVED them. They were just fine to me. Each of us ordered one of their specials for that evening. I went with the schnitzel and cider braised cabbage while Yanette M. went with the cherry tomato risotto topped with roasted cauliflower. While both dishes were delicious, the portion size of the risotto was pretty small. We also ordered a side of the bacon brussel sprouts, and a side of the crispy smashed potatoes. Both of those were excellent.The place is small, and byob, which can lead to pretty long waits. Luckily you can grab a drink at the Empty Bottle, next door, and they'll come crab you when a table opens up. Our server was friendly and gave some great recommendations. Overall, a great meal. I just think the price to portion ratio is a bit off."
"Simply put, there isn't a better spot around. Their innovative farm to table meals are ridiculous & I love that you can now order and eat breakfast @ Empty Bottle."
"One recent lacking service experience aside, Bite has become our go to delicious dinner spot. The newer decor is cozy and perfect for a low-key date, or a catch up with your girlfriends. BYOB with no corkage is always fabulous, as is the ability to grab something from next door. Some new lovely must-be-mentioneds:-Mussels and frites. $12 for a large portion bathed in a delightful savory broth served with grilled bread and frites. Too much for a starter for two people, we have learned, but we don't care. We order it anyway. They are my new favorites.-Parisian gnocchi. Amazing. Creamy. Savory. Seriously, the next time you want to splurge on a pasta, do it here. This dish is fabulous.For brunch, get a biscuit. I dare you. It's huge, fluffy, and fabulous. Served with real butter and jam, this is another way to cheat on your carb-conscious diet. No regrets, I promise.Still a decent bet for brunch too. It's small, so you might have to sit at the counter, but still great. Service is occasionally hit or miss, the set up is less than ideal due to its small size, but it doesn't keep me away. I've got nothing but love for Bite."
"4.2Went to bite cafe for brunch this weekend.  Since the place was small, the wait was a bit long (about 45 minutes) and the hostess wasn't very helpful in terms of giving us an estimated wait time.  However, there was this awesome craft fair going on in the attached Empty Bottle, which kept me sufficiently entertained (I got a sweet postcard of an Octopus that says ""Multi-tasking like a motherf*cker"" (etsy.com/listing/8265796…).  Hilarious!  Anyways, I ended up ordering the Eggs Duncan (house biscuits topped with creamed spinach and peas with Parmesan, fresh herbs and two poached eggs).  It was such a unique item that I had never seen at any restaurant, and I love me some biscuits so I couldn't resist.  It was good, but I wouldn't call it outstanding.  I felt like it was missing some meat in the mix and ended up ordering a side of bacon.  One of my eggs was perfectly cooked and the yolk oozed out, the other was completely solid all the way through.  I would go there again, but probably order something else.  I didn't get to try it, but their grilled cheese and tomato fennel soup looked outstanding.  Random aside, they have a lot of fennel in their menu options.  Something you'll either love or hate."
"First time my fiance and I ever came here was about 2 months ago for dinner. I have gotten something different with each visit... yes, I've been there enough now to use such a phrase. When we're deciding to go out lately we throw out the favorite spots and potential new ones and lo and behold, Bite keeps winning the consensus. And we haven't even tried the brunch yet.True Story: Now when we go, we do our best to remember each and thing we've gotten and decide which dish was our favorite. That's how spectacular this place is."
"Huge fan of Bite Cafe!  I've only been there for brunch and never disappointed by what I order.  The pork hash is amazing-- great dish using seasonal vegetables.  It's probably my favorite brunch dish in all of Chicago.  I also like their lemon ricotta french toast.  It's a perfect amount of lemon and balanced by ricotta and berries.  Take a look at their specials too!  They once had a coconut lemon bread/cake that was to die for.  The servers are always quick and attentive as well.  It's a small space, so I would recommend groups of 6 or more to go before the 11am brunch rush."
"One of my favorite BYOB places. The food is great (mussels and fries are awesome), the service is friendly and quick and the waiting room in the bar next door is classic.  My only complaint is that the temperature in there is generally pretty cold. Last time I was there we sat next to the widows and I kept my coat on while I ate.  It didn't disrupt the amazing taste of my white fish but it did encourage me to skip dessert to back in my warm car.  So bring a hoodie and enjoy your meal there! It's worth it."
"Bivalves lovers, rejoice!!Bite is inviting you to savor some of the most delicious mussels in the city!Now, yes, it *is* a big deal and if you know me, you know it. I am an all sea creature afficionada, and finding some tasty morsel involving fish, shells or shell AND fish makes me all happy and giddy. Life is all about simple pleasures, isn't it?So now, back to Bite concoction. Pick up the little monsters, detach them from the shell with your dainty little digits (effective, and you get to lick them afterward, double bonus!!) and drink the broth. You'll want to; with palate pleasures such as shallots, garlic, leeks, bacon, smoked paprika butter and white wine I can assure you that you won't be able to resist this heaven-sent brew almost better than any hop-based beverage.......almost.It's perfectly salty, smoky, rich and satisfying. You can mop it off with the French fries that come with each order, or one of the two slices of grilled bread flawlessly balanced on the hot pot.All of this for a mere $12.And since we are talking numbers, what about this? Sunday night supper. $20 for a bowl of soup of the day (I had a most fragrant tomato fennel), an entrée of your choice and a scoop of home-made ice-cream;  $10 for a generous breakfast poutine (come hungry and leave your diet at home!); a FREE BYOB corkage fee.Yup.All that.And I quite like it, to tell you the truth."
"While I generally believe in a healthy lifestyle, sometimes you just have to say ""F**k it!"" and do something ridiculous.  Usually, for me, something ridiculous comes in edible form.  This past Saturday, it came in the form of breakfast poutine. Basically, a Canadian heart attack and eggs got married and invited bacon gravy to the wedding.  (BACON GRAVY? Why haven't I had this before??)Naturally, I had some pound cake too, because, as Wesley Willis would say, pound cake ""puts pounds on you"" and I have to say that their citrus pound cake and coffee go together delightfully.My elliptical machine and I have to be BFFs now, I suppose, but it's totally worth it."
Pork Shoulder Hash is killer. One of the best in the city for sure.
"I've been to Bite three times now, and I have been more impressed with the food and service with each successive visit. The breakfast offerings for vegetarians being slim, I opted to have the veggie burger, even though it was only 10 a.m. It was excellent. Fresh, filling, and very flavorful. I don't know what that bun was made of, but it was delicious. For that breakfast touch, I ordered the hash browns as my side. Again, I was very pleased. Not your typical, run of the mill hash browns, these were perfectly seasoned, formed into a patty and deep-fried. My friends, both carnivores, raved about their bangers and biscuits in particular. The coffee was good and quite strong. Our waitress, whose name we didn't get but who wore an ""I Love Mpls"" t-shirt, was very pleasant and had a good vibe. My one and only gripe was the over-powering aroma of ammonia that kept wafting in from the entryway every time the front door was opened.(Note to management: Please switch to milder, odorless cleaning solution instead). It kept interfering with the delightful aroma of coffee coming from the opposite direction."
Came for dinner. Great food and service. Its a small place but it adds to the charm.
"Trying hard not to hold it against Bite Cafe just because there was a Google offer a scant 30 hours after I ate there.  It's not really their fault.  I'm just crabby.  I'll try a little maturity and forge ahead.  At first I was a little scared because the tiny space was rather packed and it took a few minutes for us to get water and menus, but it was smooth sailing from then on, and it felt more cozy than cramped.  I opted for the fried chicken special, and enjoyed it immensely.  The boneless breasts were very juicy and the fries crisp.  I also really enjoyed the slaw.  The very thinly shredded cabbage was great and there was a unique flavor to the dressing.  You can also BYOB a 40 from next door (or home or drink wine or something fancier than a 40) though I washed my chicken down with some Sprecher root beer.  My companion opted for the grilled tofu and quinoa and cleaned his plate.  I appreciated Bite's selection of veg. options so I don't have to hear the groans of disappointment of eating yet another grilled cheese/veggie burger.  Go back to Nilbog, jeez.   As for the rest of you not experiencing the sour grapes, use that Google thingie and head to Bite Cafe."
"'m a fan of Bite and I was fortunate enough to try both a brunch and dinner menu. I like that it's just down the street from me and I really like the BYO policy. If you go for dinner on a friday or Saturday night you'll also have the pleasure of waiting for a table next door at Empty Bottle and listen to live music.Bite is small and quaint a few tables and small counter near the kitchen. The decor is clean and functional with very friendly and good servers. And as with most BYOs, you receive good overall value with affordable dishes and no liquor costs. We ordered a lot for dinner and really enjoyed our selections. I preferred the dinner menu but probably mostly because of the variety and ability to eat more. The brunch menu tended for favor savory items (my preference), large portions but a small selection. I sincerely recommend checking out Bite - particularly for a solid BYO, neighborhood spot that doesn't involve sashimi. It almost classifies as a hidden gem.But enough praise, what did we eat? My main course was a special of the night and included a huge head of cauliflower served on vegetable barley with a tomato vinaigrette. It was fantastic, with great flavors and interesting textures. The sauce had just enough acidity to make things interesting but not too much to ruin the flavors of the vegetables. It's something you could have found on any menu in river north. Erica's main dish was the potato gnocchi and it was our least favorite of the night. For as interesting as it appeared - and the presentation was very good - there just wasn't any flavor once in your mouth. I almost thought it was a magic trick (and maybe they were perfectly executed gnocchi) but it just left wanting for more. We also ordered 2.5 appetizers to start: one veg spring roll, meatballs and mac n cheese. I ate the spring roll and thought it interesting and well designed. The sauce is very sweet and I liked the crispy texture. It's not a blow your mind dish but tasty none the less. We both loved the meatballs and marinara sauce - the five servings did not last long. Finally, the mac n cheese was also impressive, and large. We have high standards for one of our favorite dishes and this version was quite good. I made it better by adding some Dark Matter bbq sauce (though I was a little surprised to see a $1 charge for that on my bill...), and appreciated the good service with a piping hot plate with a slightly blackened top. We took the plunge for dessert and somehow avoided the milk shake selection and went with the fudge brownie. It wasn't my favorite and seemed to lack character of love (just felt like it was done out of necessity). It also wasn't particularly warm which always makes it taste better particularly with ice cream. As for our brunch (which was weeks before we went back for dinner):We only ordered two things, one entree each and a side of amazing bread (pumpkin if I remember correctly..?) and ridiculous brown butter. I would return and eat six orders of the bread as a meal. I ordered a scramble with lots of veggies and Erica had a traditional ""two eggs"" breakfast with sausage and toast. Most of their choices come with their ""mashbrown"" - another delicious creative concept of potatoes browned and served as a patty crispy on the outside and mashed in the middle.Erica didn't love her entire dish with sausage and toast and standard scrambled eggs (kind of mis ordered), but I was happy with my remotely healthier vegetarian option and plenty of food. Again, most of the menu items lean toward the savory and lunch side of brunch so if you're looking for flap jacks and silver dollars I suggest IHOP.Not only is the food great at Bite Cafe, but I love the vibe, setting and style of the place. It has an identity and doesn't try to be like everyone else, but always focuses on presenting high quality dishes. And as an added bonus you can bring your own booze or just walk into Empty Bottle next door and buy some on the spot. I wish I could call it a secret but it's way too late for that; even so it's worth the trip."
"I remember way-back when, early mid 90s when it first opened... it had some sort of spirit, and was some sort of attempt to bring about some flavors beyond the most beaten track. (keyword: attempt)Fortunately, that spirit died, rotted, turned rabid zombie, and eventually moved on and left the building.Today's Bite is ALL different, and seriously improved.. actually more than improved,  Bite is simply a completely different animal altogether than from which the space originally hatched.I've been here many many times, at all 3 menu offerings since rediscovering it this year, and the food is great. Very well prepared, thoughtfully concocted flavors and combinations, great specials, and generally quite prompt service.This place is very solid, and is currently a favorite 'go-to' place. I very seriously hope it stays that way...Lastly, the acoustics are terrible, and if the place is busy, it usually means it's really loud."
"Great for a quick bite! Yeah, pun intended. Cute little quirky cafe in Ukrainian Village with mishmashed tables, local art, happy people, coffee, and an menu a step above most other cafe type places. Our server was delightful, checking in often...and the food was pretty good, too. *open pulled pork sandwich on biscuits, well don't mind if I do. All gone. *side salad with tahini dressing*Diet Coke-cans.Notes: *BYOB*Friendly service*Easy (free!) parking on Western*neighbors/owners of Empty Bottle next door, they open at 5pm, so if you time it right you can jump RIGHT into happy hour, stat. Lunch for 3: about $45. In 'n out in about 40 minutes. And really, I GUESS you could call it a ""hipster"" hangout (and no, I don't use that word negatively), but I'm not a hipster and felt JUST fine. They were polite and they make good food. Enough for me! :)"
"""Meh. I've experienced better."" - that's right, Yelp stars system - ""Meh."" is all I've got for the new Bite. Yes, the new decor is very nice, the matching chairs and lamps, the renovated ""bar"" area. It's all very very nice. But that's about it, Bite has no character, no spark, no bite. Now, it's just another regular breakfast place with an absolutely regular, boring menu options, that are not even cheap anymore. I don't know/care whose idea it was to remodel and revamp the old Bite. Maybe it was the new management, maybe the hipster clients weren't leaving enough tips, who knows... All I know, is this - no longer will I proudly bring any visiting family members, numerous couch surfers, and unaware friends to this regular boring cafe. Sure, change is good, but not when it turns an original, eclectic, fun, tasty and cheap neighborhood staple into a ""Meh"". Looks like the management is following up some of the negative reviews with a ""give us a chance to get on our feet"", but what could they do? Are they gonna replace the uniform printed menus with the old book covers? Are they gonna bring back the original breakfast items to replace the totally blah sweet potato hash and poutine? I don't think so. If the place is not smashing on the opening day, or weekend, it's done. Everyone knows that restaurants and cafes only go down in awesomeness with time, not up. I wish the new Bite the best of luck, I'm not sure how they are going to attract the polished clientele that they new slick decor calls for, but I doubt that the regulars, hipsters or not, will return for the second try."
Love this place. As already mentioned this is a great place to go before you head over to the Empty bottle. Came here two weekends ago with some friends and had a great time. Yes the wait was long but we knew that before we went and planned ahead perfectly. Once we sat down our waitress was really nice and accommodating (We had a large group). I got the mussels and fries and they were fantastic. I sampled my friends roasted half chicken and the grilled cheese with tomato soup. Both were great. Seriously the food is good. I am always nervous about getting roasted chicken because most places don't season chicken well and often times its overcooked. Nope not here. Best part about the meal was for sure the price and its BYOB. Cannot wait to go back.
"I am here, at least once a week!!! Sometimes more, it depends on the mood, i guess. Anyways.... My boyfriend and I love coming in here. It's so close by to where we live. We can just walk over. We never have to wait longer than 15 or 20 minutes, so that's awesome!! The food is great. I think I may have tried everything on the menu, probably not but most of them. My favorites are: Egg Duncan, Pork Hash and they used to have the Chorizo Hash too. It's so good. They use plaintains in the bottom of the pork and chorizo hash, so, you get all this spicyness and then bam!!! sweetness comes along. So good! YUMMMM!!! I've also had the Almond Crusted French Toast. Really yummy! On a hot summer day, sometimes I ordered the milk shakes. I mean, they are to die for!!! So good!!!! However, since i come here very very often, I get bored sometimes with the menu. They have specials on the board, so, that's nice but it's pretty much the same everytime i come in but i still love the food though. It's byob! But, if you forgot to bring your own bottle, you can just cross over to the empty bottle and buy yourself a drink and bring it over to Bite and have it with your meal. Not too bad.The service are always great. They have very friendly staff. I can't recall all of their names but i know elise (i think that's how you spell it) always waits on us and she's always very uppity and nice and super friendly. It's always so nice to see her there when we come in. I love the music, the decor and the arts on the walls. Well... we will see you soon, bite cafe :)"
"lots of things to like, but weak on execution.adorable brunch spot on a saturday morning, but the general theme was that all the food was way too salty.from their specials of the day:smoked whitefish chowder. I love the idea of this chowder, it was deliciously smokey, but way too salty. rustic, large chunks of potato and carrot were a welcome reprieve from the too-salty chowder, but i couldn't finish it.mash browns -- this is their default potato side course for breakfast.  instead of hash browns, a deep fried patty of mashed potatoes.  the mashed potatoes are a bit gummy, which i think is deliberate to hold the patty together while frying.  LOVE this concept, cooked well, outside was hot, crispy, and the inside was creamy.  over seasoned like the whitefish, so i couldn't finish this either.goat cheese, mushroom, arugula omelette -- very average omelette, was slightly overcooked, i prefer my eggs a little wetter. nothing special, this dish is a 3. most people probably will love it just because the filling ingredient quality was quite nice, but lacking on executionbraised pork shoulder hash with poached eggs -- this also would have been awesome if it wasn't too salty. i found myself gravitating towards the poached eggs, just because the yolks weren't salted.  when you're drinking egg yolks as a way to reduce the salt concentration in your mouth, something is definitely wrong."
My girlfriend took me to Bite last week for a pre-Valentine dinner. This restaurant is truly a gem. The decor is simple but attractive. it is a small space but it is utilized well and the seating is not crowded. The food was great. I had the mushroom soup-amazing. The stuffed quail special was great and the ice cream brownie desert was wonderful as well. Our server could not have been better. I look forward to coming back as there were several other dishes on the menu that piqued my interest. Prices are very reasonable and it is BYOB which makes for a very affordable dinner.
"I saw that some of my Yelp friends have reviewed this place and stated that unless you are a hard core hipster, get ready for crappy service, poorly executed food, and a snotty demeanor.OK, well, my husband and I are about as far from hipster as it gets and we had a stellar experience at Bite! I love the newly remodeled space, it is so clean and airy with the pops of turquoise against the dark wood and the brick walls.  I got the tofu scramble, which on this particular day was tofu mixed with garlic, piquillo peppers and swiss chard.  It also came with this mashed potato cake which was amazing.  Andy got...wait for it...breakfast poutine which is of course made breakfast-y by the addition of a perfectly cooked poached egg.  A messy, beautiful, completely wrong, yet omg delicious creation.I wonder if I am too old to be a hipster, because if this is the kind of place ""only hipsters go to"" I might consider a revamp of the wardrobe.  mmm, ironic tattoos and unflattering skirt lengths?  Er, OK no.  Will just keep coming back here!"
"I have a two-week old pile of laundry near my bed, a broken window in the bathroom,and a month-long defunct stove and fridge in my kitchen. I lack the drive to ensure my diet is more than canned soup or I have clothes for work, but I'll gladly set laziness aside to laud the praises of Bite Cafe.A neurotic who hates seeing his own words in writing, I don't commit my thoughts to a diary, though if I did, I'd suspect somebody had read it and based Bite Cafe around its entries.  I dropped in on a Tuesday, a day that coincides with a delightful special of 40 ouncers and fried chicken at Bite Cafe. The bird is a juicy little thing, with a fried shell akin to the firmness of candy coating, the flakiness of pastry, and a helping of seasonings like wafting opening the spice pantry. The fries were respectable and the booze involved a fun little errand of slipping through a side door, speakeasy style, to nab it from the neighboring Empty Bottle.While the place is good enough for me to set aside my sloth and review it, I fear it's impossible for me to have the drive to exhaustively detail the nuances that make it great. A playlist of British Invasion and 60's Protest Rock, Jay Ryan's fingerprints all over the rocking venue next door, and a pixie of a waitress who makes you wish you were in high school, just for the chance that she may ask you to Sadie Hawkins.Boiled down, if you're in spitting distance, swing by. If not, it's worth the trek for a great Sunday night dinner, or mid-week meal as a reprieve from the working world."
"Brunch poutine, guys.Brunch. Poutine.Poutine. For brunch. It's brunchy because it has an egg on it.You're welcome."
My favorite place for breakfast.only thing the waiting is long for food.took them over 40 min.
Super cool vibe--service SUPER well-meaning but maybe not 100% professional (but I guess you can go to Applebee's for that)....  Our server Matt practically sat down with us and was so charming we invited him over for Christmas (he was otherwise engaged).  Food was delicious -- creative if maybe a but high-priced for that hood.  Loved that the bathroom was steps away from the kitchen prep areas.  I think.
"I love this place.  Atmosphere, good.  Service, good.  Food, good.(""Jam, good. Custard, good.  Meat, good.""  Ten points for you if you get that.)Another Supper Club joint, we brought a boat load of beers and the girl brought us over buckets of ice to chill them in, bonus points.We had some mac and cheese and buffalo tofu strips to start, both fabulous.  If you love fried chicken, come here hungry and order the crispy pork shank and stare in wonder at it before diving in.  omgheavenlypork."
"Valentine's Day Weekend 2012 : Had reservations at a fancy restaurant with the beau. We got to the restaurant, all dressed up in our fancy clothes, and mutually decided we were just not in the mood for that kind of a night. Who were we trying to fool anyway? We wanted to pig out, have some drinks, and most importantly RELAX. We drove home, changed into some jeans and embarked on an hour long journey trying to find a place that didn't have a 2.5 hours wait (not gunna happen). Then we remember hearing about a place by our apartment, and decided to give them a call. After hearing there was NO WAIT(!!!!!), we headed on over to Bite.We made sure to grab the only alcohol we had in the house, since Bite is BYOB (!!!!!), which was pink champagne (so appropriate for Valentine's Day) and said a little prayer that we would like this place because it's just so close by.Fast forward to a month later, and we've been there about 10 times. I absolutely love the gnocchi, the burger, the chicken, the egg rolls (and I don't even like egg rolls), the panna cotta, the brownie, OK let's just say I like it all. Everyone I've come here with has been really impressed and left very satisfied. The best part about Bite, and I know I've already mentioned this, but it's BYOB! You can't beat BYOB.I can't believe I haven't been here for brunch yet. I must try it ASAP. I deduct one star because the bathroom is in the kitchen and that is a little awkward. Other than that, this place is perfect. I'm so glad to have found it."
This morning I ate what was left over from the fish fry I had here last night and I will be damned if the fish didn't taste even better today. I ate it cold and it was still just as crispy as when it was served. So good.Service is great and we didn't have to wait on a Friday at 6:30. There was an early show (5:30) at the bottle so it probably helps to check their schedule before you plan your trip. It's in a great spot for me as it is right by Amish Healthy Foods and I love that store.
Heres how it is... next time I want to pay 15 bucks for two pieces of tofu with three mushrooms and a conservative sprinkle of scallions I'll drag my sorry ass to Bite.The only thing that Bites is yo prices!!! And for that you get 2 stars.
"Service was a bit slower than i'd prefer, but Bite Cafe does have a laid back feeling to it, but it wasn't excruciatingly slow. Fast turn over too, at least when my fiancee and i went. She had the Pork hash which she really enjoyed. I think I got one bite and it was good, but had enough on my own plate. I had the Monte Cristo, i'm a sucker for that sweet-salty combo and this nailed it. Ham and turkey along with provolone sandwiches between two pieces of french toast and strawberry jam. Yup, just started salivating thinking about it. We'll definitely be headed back to Bite...maybe even today."
"The hubs and I hit Bite for brunch one week ago, walked in at prime time and didn't wait for a seat. We aren't coffee drinkers (I know, I know, so uncool!) so we ordered tea, which is the one thing they could upgrade. C'mon Bruce, Stash? How about Mighty Leaf, Rishi, or Harney&Sons? The food, on the other hand, was delicious! Orange-fennel glazed french toast was toothsome, unique and delicious, and the Eggs Duncan, biscuits topped with poached eggs and creamed English peas and spinach, left me with no regrets about eating green vegetables for breakfast!It doesn't hurt that Bite is next-door to the Empty Bottle, one of our favorite music venues in Chicago. Before the last show my husband's band played there I ordered an amazing half chicken and the hubs had what he insists was the BEST HAMBURGER IN CHICAGO! How about that?"
"Hot Damn...this place rules. Just got back and I'm already thinking about what I'll order next time. I had the fried chicken and 40oz combo, which means I get to go through the secret door to the Empty Bottle, order a 40oz beer and voila a free mac and cheese appears on the table while I'm unscrewing my Big Bear 40oz. The little lady had the gnocchi which was one wink shy of heaven. My fried chicken was full tilt, complete with sweet potato fries and a light cole slaw and tabasco hot dipping sauce. We shared the 40oz and savored the delicious meal and then licked our plates clean. We finished the meal with the homemade rich fudge brownie topped with pecans, malted caramel sauce, whipped coffee cream, and a stout flavored ice cream, all made in house, prepared with love and knowledge and devoured bit by bit while we drooled and giggled like school girls. The service was top notch all the way, 20% tip territory, personable, friendly, a bit feisty, a bit funny and all around enjoyable. The atmosphere is warm, inviting, relaxing, laid back and perfect for a slow dinner. We have found our new favorite restaurant. Bite for dinner on Saturday and Feed for Brunch on Sunday. God Bless the United States of Freedom! The Big Bear 40oz made me feel very sleepy, almost drugged, but that has nothing to do with Bite. I guess a 40oz called Big Bear hits me harder than I thought.  OVERALL: I can't wait to go back."
"Hadn't been to Bite Cafe since I moved from Ukranian Village in 2005. I treated a friend to dinner before a show at Empty Bottle. Service was great and the food was tasty. My only complaint was the size of the daily special that I ordered. I was looking for a couple of vegan options and the Sauteed Rice w/Veggies sounded filling (as I was going to be having a few beers next door, I wanted something to fill me up a bit). My entree was so small that I pretty much ordered dessert just to put something in my stomach. For $15 I expect to feel full, next time I'll order something off of the menu that costs less and will hopefully be more plentiful."
"Bite Cafe represents a price range and atmosphere combination that isn't too easy to find in Chicago.  It reminds me of a cheaper, byob Lula Cafe, and what's not to like about that? I will admit, however, that perhaps my favorite element of Bite is its late night menu, featuring the ""Bite Mac,"" a $6 non fast food version of the Big Mac. Combined with the lower than average prices and interesting booking at Empty Bottle next door, you get an almost sure-fire successful evening (assuming your benchmark for success is being full, drunk, and entertained at a reasonable price)."
"I am in love with Bite Cafe and want the world to know!! A kitshy, comfy small cafe with big flavor and all purely homemade food. The Parisian gnocchi was earthy and delicious. BYOB and super unpretentious. It's attached to a bar so you can order a bottle of wine if you forgot your own, a nice little touch. I already am anticipating my next trip."
I had the breakfast tacos and they were amazing!! The black beans added so much to this dish. They add a side of guac too which was deli and I'm super picky when it comes to guac!
"This place is awesome. Fresh, seasonal menu. The mussels are delish, be sure to dip your french fries in the broth (forget the ketchup!). It can get kinda busy so the wait staff may not appear super attentive, but the food is stellar and its byob so it all balances out. Definitely a wonderful dinner date place or a fun place to go w/ your girlfriends for a yummy local restaurant. Check it out!"
"Bite Cafe has become a regular spot for my boyfriend and I, after over half a dozen great experiences for dinner and brunch.  Low-key neighborhood vibe, very little (if any) wait time for a table, attentive and friendly staff, rockin' menu with great specials, cool crowd, very well-priced AND it's BYO!I've really liked everything I've tried (except for the head cheese...but that was my own damn fault for ordering it), but if I could recommend anything, it'd be the Coq Au Vin.  Seriously you guys...I had the waiter thank the chef twice for me.  Ridiculous."
"The decor is shabby chic and I really like the discarded book covers as menu holders. A group of us went here for breakfast (Generally Annoying Trend in the City of Big Shoulders: all weekend breakfast is now ""brunch"" in Chicago) and ordered the Chorizo hash (sietan version) and my friend ordered the avocado omelet. The food was OK. I did not think there was much about either the coffee, service, or preparation that made me want to pick this place over the traditional Greek diners that abound in Chicago. For $16.00 a person we had a nice meal, but none of us are in a rush to get back to this place. Oh, and what is with the single piece (cut in two slices) of toast. I really dislike the new ""fad"" of scrimping on toast. Sorry, but I can't celebrate something that looks great, but is not as good as a Mexican breakfast at a Taqueria or an old fashioned diner where the server is mom's age and calls you ""honey."""
"Ever since my first trip to Bite, I have only been able to order two things: the veggie egg roll, and the beet salad. They're SO good, that I literally cannot bring myself to try anything else. Luckily my boyfriend is a very adventurous eater, and he often tries menu items that I wouldn't normally order. Therefore, I am fairly confident that this place has the best tomato soup in all of Chicago.The place is cozy, warm, and bright, with a very friendly waitstaff. It can be a bit of a wait for a table, but come on, people, the place seats like 40 people. Be patient, and belly up to the bar for a glass of wine that you bought for $6, and are drinking FOR FREE. For me, this place will be a staple, and I've already made plans to bring several out-of-towners so that they can see why I love my neighborhood so much. Keep it up, Bite!"
"Perhaps it was my fault.  Our waiter told me that the chicken would be 20-25 minutes, ""Is that alright?""  I asked for his recommendation, ""Is there anything spicy?""""Spicy?  No, not right now.  Not really.""""Well what would you recommend?""""The pork shank is really good.""Maybe it was my fault for taking the advice of someone so skinny.  In hindsight, he probably wasn't a meat-eater.  Maybe he recommended it because it was the most expensive item on the menu.  Maybe he saw that I didn't fit in with the clientele and wanted to open up his table as quickly as possible.The pork shank entree is basically a hunk of meat that is fried and tastes like nothing but salt.  It comes with what seems to be one of those Jewel insta-salads that comes out of a plastic container.  Lots of rucola and a sliver of a red pepper here and there.  For 18 bucks, I figured I would get something with a little more flavor.  If Bite added a few small potatoes (better yet, croquettes!) and some sort of gravy or jam, it could be worth it.My boyfriend had the pulled pork sandwich, which I was incredibly jealous of because not only was it cheaper, but it came with real vegetables (broccoli, some kraut, and a pickle).  Well .... more vegetable-like than lettuce, anyhow.  He liked his sandwich but he wasn't overly enthusiastic about it either.I left the restaurant not feeling full.  If I were to ever return (unlikely) I think I would have to look to their vegetarian options (e.g. the rest of the menu) because at least those were served with some sort of carb."
"Bite Cafe is a hidden treasure in Ukrainian Village. We dropped by on a Thursday evening for dinner and were immediately impressed by the restaurant's simple yet warming and comfortable setup inside. There was ample parking and the place, while small, was easy to find. The food portions were large and filling and while we only ordered two dishes, both were excellent. My buddy got the Beef Stroganoff and it was far better than any stroganoff I've had before. There was a lot of flavor, some of which was surprising and went well beyond what you might think a usual dish like this would taste. All components were well cooked and part of me wish I had ordered this instead! But I got the pork shoulder steak special and I have zero regret. The portion was large and came on a bone, served on top of delicious short grain tomato rice stir fried with some greens. There was also a brush of sauce over the top of the pork steak and I couldn't tell what it was besides the fact that it was yummy and went well with the meat. The steak itself was well cooked, crispy around the edges and lined with a small amount of fat that was just amazing with the rest of the meat. There was a smidge too much oil in the rice/greens and a little too much salt on the steak for my personal preferences but those were minor and didn't take away from the dish as a whole. Overall, considering the price and in comparison with other restaurants around Chicago, the value and quality here at Bite is very, very good. Service was very fast, the waiters were friendly, and the atmosphere was conducive to good conversation (not much light though). Of no concern to me, but maybe for others, the restroom for customers is inside the kitchen. 4 stars for great tasting food at a pretty good value. Definitely coming back!"
"I have only been here for Brunch, but since I have, I have not gone anywhere else for brunch.  The pork hash is redic!  Basically it is like a big man's portion of Eggs Benedict with wonderful fixin's.   The pork hash has a piece of bread with two eggs on top, carnitas, a spicy jalapeno hollandaise sauce with brussel sprouts and squash mixed in.  I personally have never had anything more delicious for breakfast.Lastly, they make homemade shakes/malts the real way.  With scoops of ice cream.. and they serve it to you in the big milk shake glass with the metal mixer on the side.  Bonus points."
"Awesome fried gnocchi, tasty mussels, and fresh chicken paillard. Efficient service."
"This has become one of my favorite places. The food is amazing, and the service is great. You cannot beat the quality of the food for the price point. The variety of daily specials and the sunday brunch makes this place an all around restaurant. I strongly suggest this place to everyone who likes good food, made with fresh ingredients at a good price."
This place was just ok to me at best. My boyfriend said the same. Not a huge selection of items to choose from. Can't even say I would try it a 2nd time cuz if I was in the area again I'd be going across the street to Lockdown.
"My husband and I stopped in for dinner while waiting for a show at the adjacent Empty Bottle.  The only trouble we had here was deciding on something, as more than half the menu was right up our alley.  I ended up having a salad with watercress and shaved fennel, which was excellent; he had the beet salad with oranges and olives which was good but a little more tangy than I like.  I loved the side dish of Brussels sprouts with bacon; we were split on the vegetarian egg roll.  My husband liked it and I didn't enjoy the tofu chunks in the filling.  This was all washed down with black cherry soda (from bottles); the soft drinks menu is limited.  Then the cardamom-and-orange pannacotta and an excellent cup of Dark Matter coffee made a great end to the meal.Service was fine; we were amused when the waiter practically apologized for the kiwi-strawberry soda on the menu (we did not order it).We'd be happy to make a return visit if we're in the area again."
"I came here a few weeks back with my boyfriend. What a great find! It was cozy, reasonably priced, delicious, and BYOB!I had the beef shortrib stroganoff which was excellent!It is a smaller restaurant and is probably better for smaller groups. We will definitely return to Bite Cafe."
I tried this place a few months ago and had a WONDERFUL curry meal. The place is really charming and has great prices. I love the simple decor and the wait staff are really friendly.
"If fish tacos are on the menu, get them. They're huge and worth the $4 each. I've never had a better fish taco. I've been thinking about them for three days.Bite always seats me quickly, always has great service and always feeds me delicious food. My girlfriend and I last visited at 10 p.m. on a Sunday night and were treated to a candlelit dinner near a big window where we could watch the rain fall on Western Avenue. Perfect.Well, we may have found pubic hair in our fries, but we were too happy to care."
"I figured Bite was going to be like any other run-of-the-mill breakfast place. It kind of drives me crazy when restaurants specialize in one meal, especially when the meal is breakfast. I had the corned beef hash, and I will be going back for sure.Maybe Bite made a believer out of me, but I think the fact that the corned beef wasn't completely minced up into tiny pieces, and it didn't taste like it came from a Dinty Moore can was enough for me. The food was fresh. It had fresh vegetables in it, the meat was cooked perfectly, and the dish looked beautiful on the plate. It had been well-thought-out and well executed, and that's enough for 4 stars. The food was under-seasoned, but I took care of that with the handy pepper shaker from the table.My friend who was with me said the omelet he had was the ""best he'd ever tasted."" Definitely a great find at a great value.Edit:I came back here on Valentine's Day for brunch and ordered the exact same dish. However, this time it wasn't as good. I'm not sure if they were having an off day, but one of my eggs had jiggling whites in it... An amateur mistake when serving over easy eggs. Shame. I'm not pulling any stars until I've been again."
"Perhaps I wasn't aware when I wrote the review years ago, but you can totally sit on the Empty Bottle side for brunch.  Much more character--same great food and friendly service (and they totally refresh your coffee!)"
"Bring your babies, moms, expensive wines, silk ties, shiny shoes, Japanese frames, strollers, pressed jeans and your pinkie finger in the air. New Bite is now ready for the fancy Wicker Park crowd, and is no longer a hippie-commie-dirty-crummy extension of the Empty Bottle and the surrounding crusty neighborhood. The menu is fancier, the tables are new, the dishes are smaller and more expensive. The standard dishes are gone, so is the daily soup and some drink options.All Bite had to to was a minor menu revamp, now everything is different and I'm not allowed in anymore.People looking for a fancy dinner who have never been to Bite, rejoice, eat, and drive back to the suburbs."
"""How dare you!"", I thought when I bit into my pork chop last night. ""How dare you make a pork chop this damned delicious.""This was my second time at Bite and they did not disappoint. Bite is making food that is simple in the best of ways.A delicious well chosen organic root beer.A tender and fine cut pork chop.Delicious wild mushroom medley.Solid flavors with a enough character to build a story but not trying to be a Broadway show.All fine quality ingredients.Great price.Just the way I like it."
"Up there fore the best brunch in Chicago.  Pork Hash highly recommended.  Hard to get in, but worth the wait and attached to an amazing bar-come-artist market that is great to wander around."
"First off... I think its very odd that a manager/owner can write a reply to a review... Doesn't that mildly defeat the purpose of what we are all doing here??**Thanks for the retort Bruce... We know you think its great... you own it. And if your establishment was not 100% ready the first weekend we came in, maybe you shouldn't have opened your doors to public. But.. I digress... for I did give BITE another chance.. but after 3 attempts for they were closed twice for private parties.My original review stands... This place is not good anymore.. All the character  is gone & the plates are not exciting anymore. Every place in Wicker is now serves salmon on bagels, granola & yogurt and tofu scramblers... except every other place serving the exact same stuff... started out that way and didnt transform from something unique and original. If you like waiting outside with no place to rest for a table, or if you like being ""seen"" and paying a price to do so.... then this place is a must visit....If you like creative dishes at reasonable prices... invent a time machine.. because that BITE is dead."
"The new Bite bites. Why would a restaurant get rid of half of their selections? And replace them with bland, tasteless options?Thanks for the $10 piece of bread you call a ""muffaletta."" And just because your pasta is green doesn't mean it's pesto. On the bright side, the toilet now flushes."
"The old Bite was better than the new Bite.The food quality has not gone up and the service has not changed.  So why did they raise the prices?  I'm not going to eat the new hardwood floor and new tables are not going to take my order.I'll try brunch maybe in the future, but as of now, I would not recommend dinner.  To be honest, I don't think I'll go back for brunch.I hope these changes attract new customers with bigger pocketbooks.  I will always like the staff and wish them luck."
"how does this place only have three and half stars on yelp? it's soooo good. came here for brunch and was met with some of the best frickin eggs benedict ever.but be careful because they are misleadingly named pork hash. pork is tender and juicy and the bread (i think sourdough?) was chewy and delicious. and this is one of the best hollandaise sauces i've ever had. and it was spicy too! it had such a good amount of tanginess, which is usually what's missing in hollandaise sauces. good consistency too - i guess my complaint would be that there's not enough of the sauce. but the fact is, you cannot have enough of the sauce. if they put this sauce in a bowl and called it soup, i'd drink it.also had the breakfast poutine, which was great! the gravy was good and the eggs oozing out onto my fries were a good thing too. pickled chiles were a great touch for adding some freshness and crunch.a little bonus: they had a pumpkin bread on special and that was delicious too. sweet but not too sweet and soft but not too dense or mushy. cinnamon butter on it was the perfect touch.and if the great food weren't enough, we had an amazing waitress who was super sweet and nice and answered all our stupid questions and was friendly about it. i love modest places with great food and bite fits that perfectly."
Bite is a cute little place with awesome comfort food. I had the grilled cheese/tomato soup combo and it was delicious.
"Biscuits and gravy with an egg on top, FTW!I was really impressed with the brunch at Bite. I went there last weekend with a couple friends and we all had amazing food in a chill, quiet environment, which is rare for Sunday brunch it seems. The wait wasn't as long as other brunch places in the area and the menu was small, but full of unique and tasty items like the aforementioned biscuits and gravy that was on special that day, as well as a pork hash that was deemed ""awesome"" and vegetarian breakfast poutine. No complaints here-- I will definitely be back."
"Greeted with a very tasty Dark Matter coffee and soft slice of pumpkin bread with cinnamon spread. Easy seating for 10am on a Saturday but filled up fast. Pork shoulder Hash with egg over easy was amazing. It had a spicy hollandaise sauce and the sour dough underneath soaked up the egg yoke, the sweetness of the potatoes complemented the saltiness of the pork nicely. Very comfy yet intimate quarters. Service was wonderful. This was my first try; however, I will be back."
"In a neighborhood rife with monosyllabic brunch locations (Feed, Toast, Jam, etc.) Bite has risen to the top of my list, thanks in large part to its recent upgrade. I won't apologize for being delighted by its much-needed scrub-down!The differences are subtle but go deeper than just the new blue chairs and the smell of sawdust greeting you when you walk in the door. The tattered book-cover menus with remnants of food on them are gone, replaced with simple card stock (albeit with a fancy typeface). The menu feels familiar but the presentation is more thoughtful than I remember. They continue to offer plenty of solid vegetarian options, including a farro and beet salad that unexpectedly blew me away. And the people-watching is still as good as ever."
"Walked out and will never return due to the rudeness of the staff. I attempted to have brunch with my family on Sunday, in speaking to the very rude host I was told it was more than an hour wait for a table, although there were 3 empty tables in sight and no one waiting. When I inquired about the empty table the host thrust a notebook into my face telling there was a wait, interesting enough each name had already been crossed off. I can only assume my children and I weren't welcome!"
"I went to Bite for the first time since the renovation. All I can really say is that they traded all of the good qualities for a nicer wood floor and tables. It's like they sterilized the whole place, and now it's just a regular old cafe with standard everything. The food choices are now limited, eggs and toast, simple and boring. Even the photography on the walls is mundane. What a waste of resources. The place really only deserves 1 star now. It was dead at 10:30 on Saturday morning, where it used to be bustling with activity.The menus used to be clad in old book covers, the tables were recycled from a derelict diner, and even the art on the walls was eclectic and unique. The food was outstanding, with vegetarian options, a wide selection, and kind of tex-mex flair.All of what made bite a neat place is gone now, and so I will be too. At least the Flying Saucer is nearby, and hasn't sold out."
"I used to love Bite. I think, objectively speaking, I might even like the new Bite if I'd never been to the old one. But it truly pales in comparison. It's prettier, for sure, and fancier, but from the decor to the menu, it really lacks character. A fake philly cheese steak? I could get that anywhere. The Bite nachos, the miso tofu, the incredible veggie cheeseburger, the list of amazing options now missing from the new menu is nearly endless. Bite USED to be one of the absolute best vegetarian options in the city, with tasty food at a reasonable price point, just grungey enough to be hip but too nice to be a diner or similarly hole in the wall joint. The new Bite looks like every other new cafe in town. It looks cookie cutter cute, but not special. It almost feels like a pretend restaurant, an art installation on the modern trendy brunch cafe.Not to mention, the new menu lacks the assortment of tasty beverage options Bite once had (an awesome soy cappuccino, watermelon lemonade) and the limited dessert menu (Bite used to have nightly specials, usually 3-4 options) has nuts in every single item, making people will allergies look elsewhere for sweets after a meal (some of them don't even need the nuts - I don't understand pecan sandies with pot de creme).Pluses are the much better tea options and the aforementioned pot de creme (I made my girlfriend eat the nuts off of the top and the cookie that wanted my mouth to swell shut, but I'm one of the lucky few with nut allergies who can get away with that). I'll admit that Bite is pretty, and I appreciate the effort, but it's simply no longer worth the effort. What was once a staple of my dining routine is now one of so many generic options. I mean, I'm a vegetarian, if I want a sandwich, I can go to Jimmy John's or something. I miss Bite when they served real food in a real atmosphere, that looked like it belonged next to the Empty Bottle."
"Forewarning is fairwarning, or so they say. Unfortunately, I really can't attest since I'm a stubborn mule with a penchant for BYOBrunch - apparently even disappointing ones. How exactly does this happen? Because even after being adequately advised on Bite's shortcomings well in advance I still allowed my curiosity to get the best of me (as it often does) for Sunday brekkie despite the cautionary words of the lovely Erin P:  ""Sure, we can go to Bite if you want to, but the service is awful there unless you're a hipster."" Ok. Whatever, E. Little does she know, I'm super hip! Oh yes, I've got dirty chucks and black skinny jeans. I can go without washing my hair. And you know what, I think I may even be able to still squeeze into my Minnetonka's from 1987! Watch out, Hipster Barfly is on the move! Fabu service 10 feet ahead! Uhhhh, what happened to my well executed plan? Did the blonde hair give me away? The lip gloss? The French manicure? Betrayed by those damn sneaky French again!! It must be that... why else am I sitting for 25 minutes just waiting to be acknowledged?!? Hipster waitress - where oh where did you get those big Pee Wee glasses - I know you see me. And I'm thirsty. It's your job to fix this. Please? I get that my costume isn't fooling you and is probably mildly insulting, but I'm still a person who deserves some civility dammit! ...And thus goes the push and pull that became the worst service of brunch ever. Plain 'ol lazy, inattentive, negligent service. It was like pulling teeth to get coffee, juice, champagne cups, place an order, ask for napkins, get the correct sides with my entrée. Pee Wee-ette was clearly on meth. Thank God I'm not really a hipster. Oh! You want to know about the food? It was really good. I had a delightful herb and goat cheese omelette with a side of pinto beans (don't ask) and some wheat toast with shady grape jelly (they put Smuckers in mason jars to make it look home-made, Tricksters!)...  All enjoyable, nothing killed me, I'd eat it again with pleasure in more hospitable surroundings.   The biggest redeemer of Bite?? It's literally attached to the bar Empty Bottle. Oh yes, maximum convenience for day-drinking away the shame of being snubbed by the chick in the ironic Sally Jessy specs."
"used to be the best place in the city for quality food, creative and ever changing menu couple with extremely reasonable prices. No longer. The new ""chef"" puts his name on the menu-I'd be embarrassed and take it off. No longer creative, rarely changes, quality is average at best (what are those ""mash browns"" something out of a package that are bulky and greasy).I started going there in 1997. Introduced proudly to many friends who also became regulars. Its off my list sadly. When the new owners took over they spruced it up a little but the quality and creativity is gone. Too bad. They won't last and maybe the replacement will restore it to the great place it was.1 star because some of the food is average (those mash browns are not as good as the McDonalds breakfast potatoes)."
"I looked through my reviews and it seems like there's a lot of hate going on, so I'm going to mix it up with a love post for Bite!I never ate at the old place, but I can definitely recommend the new. The place is intimate, but casual feeling (love the blue chairs). The lighting and noise level are perfect. And the food and prices are stellar.Being a BYOB helps with the latter, but it's still surprising considering how well prepared the food is. I had the fried chicken with garlic, which was divine. We also shared a couple of yummy appetizers and desserts. I highly recommend the butterscotch pudding. It's a bit of a drive from Evanston, but worth the trip. My only complaint -- and it's more of a suggestion -- is that there's NO mirror in the bathroom, which also happens to be right off the kitchen -- a girl needs a mirror."
Great ambience and even better food. Service is great!
"My boyfriend and I went to this place on New Years Eve- we had been traveling all day and were just looking for a place to crash and get good eats. What we found at Bite Cafe fully satisfied both of those requirements. The atmosphere, for one, was amazing. Candlelit tables and a relaxed/family atmosphere...It gave you the sense of being at home away from home.The food was luscious and creative as well as moderately priced. I got mussels and a side salad for ~$9 and my boyfriend got the eggplant parmesan for $9 as well. Both of our dishes were enjoyed :) I had never had mussels before and the lovely broth they were served in made them incredibly tasty.The only downfall of the night was service, but only because it was so busy. It took a good 10 minutes for us to get our check after we had requested it.I've heard that Bite Cafe is known for its brunch and seeing as the dinner was this good, you can bet we'll be making a trip back."
"As someone who ate at ""both"" Bite's, I think people saying that the old Bite was better are on crack. The food IS better now, by far, unless you don't have good taste in food.Both brunch and dinner are delicious, and for the quality, creativity, and flavor, I think extremely well priced. The service is significantly better at dinner, but I think that is pretty common. AND you can get pasta for breakfast. I mean...Love the house-made ricotta. Loved the arancini, a vegetarian option to get all the flavors of a buffalo wing. We had 2 types of fish (trout and whitefish), and both were cooked perfectly-cripsy skin and moist fish-delicious. Oh and people were freaking out about the chicken leg sandwich (on both brunch and dinner menu).Bite also has a late night menu from 10:30-2 with fish tacos and corn dogs, which just happen to be two of my favorite things!!!As others have mentioned it is byo, but if you forget, you can get drinks at the bottle and a few options on bottles of wine for $15."
This is one of my favorite spots in the city.  Everything on the menu is good!  Order the poutine and the gnocchi.  The staff is very friendly and it's BYOB.  This place is a hidden gem.
"Super delicious. I had the banana, walnut and sea salted whipped cream French toast on a yucky Monday morning and honestly the sun came out when we left the restaurant.We found it in Bon Appetit Magazine. They were spotlighted bc of their poutin (served as french fries, over-easy egg, pickled something and something else) Mom got a half order of that and loved it.  She also got the biscuit and jam.. it was good and butteryDad got the bagel with lox and enjoyed it..And I don't remember what Sally's dish was called but it was mushrooms and leaks with a potato pancake? it looked really good:)Needless to say, we're going back this week for more :) also I forget the waitress' name but she had glasses and tattoos and was very pleasantThey almost got 4 stars because it was raining and made us wait outside until exactly 9, maybe a couple minutes after.. dad had to tell them through the open window that it was time to let us in haha oops but the food made all of that better:)"
"Been here for brunch and had a delicious bruchetta, a nice twist on the name, served with sourdough served open face with poached eggs, hollandaise and some leeks & mushrooms.  Really nice combination, the hollandaise wasn't too over powering to taste anything else, but still had the creamy and savory consistency it needs.  Also served with a mashbrown and bacon, the mashbrown is Bite's version of a hashbrown patty, I'm not sure exactly what was in it but it was great.  The rest of the group I was with had burgers and they were all happy with them, nothing fancy on the burgers, just good solid burgers.We'll be back here.  Just an FYI it's a tiny little place, so if you go during peak hours be prepared to wait a few minutes, they do not take reservations."
"Went here for brunch with the parents and brother on a Sunday Morning.   Very good service staff, the food was fresh and very well prepared.  The prices are cheap and the portion sizes are very generous to say the least.  The mushroom gravy is spectacular over the biscuit (which are moist and buttery!).  I had the Pork Hash, which was spectacular, one of our party had the Vegetarian fritata, another had breakfast poutine.  Every single dish was delicious!  The coffee and the OJ were also above the curve!"
"Love this place. Not a huge selection, but I always find something new and great to eat and haven't been disappointed yet. It's BYOB which is great to bring a bottle of wine or a 6-pack of beer in. Brunch is very good as well. Service has always been outstandings for me. The prices are very reasonable as well. It's hard to find such good food for a great price in the area. Vegan friendly too."
This is my go to place for a late night dinner because everything on their (limited) nighttime menu is between $5-$7. The staff is super friendly and the place has a great atmosphere - I love going here.
"I feel they're deserving of a 4 over a 3. I was torn but then I thought back to our random Friday night dinner here and I must say - we were very satisfied. I had the Philly Cheese Fake and was amazed with this healthy alternative to the real deal. And it re-heated well the next day! Their fries are delish. Though I didn't have any drinks, I thought it was super cool that people were walking in with their drinks from the side entry to the Empty Bottle next door! Way to partner up so everybody's happy (unless it's the same owner and I just have no idea). Either way, cool. I really like the ambiance and will go back again."
"Oh Bite, I used to love you so much, and would visit you at least once a week for that warm atmosphere you had, the great service, and the awesome veggie double cheeseburger and vegetarian specials you had.But after two tries, I just can't forgive the changes, and the abysmal vegetarian menu options. I know you want to be upscale now, and your new decor is lovely, but that joke of a Veggie Muffaletta? Are you serious with that? This is what I experienced: Two big, cold slabs of mealy focaccia surrounding what can best be described as a couple of roasted red peppers from a jar, some mediocre olive salad, some generic Italian salad dressing, and one- ONE- lonely thin slice of cold provolone cheese. Perhaps I'm spoiled, growing up eating kickass New Orleans muffalettas, but this Bite version wasn't even TRYING to be anything more than a castoff appease-the-vegetarians option on a menu heavy on the meat-based dishes. In their defense, I guess, the fries that accompanied my inedible mostly-bread sandwich were great. So there you go- 2 stars for some $10 fries.My dining partner was also incredibly disappointed in his Philly Cheese Fake sandwich, which contained none of the described onions and peppers- and not nearly enough portobella. As a vegetarian, the new Bite just isn't worth the money, which is a shame, because the old Bite was truly a gem."
"This place is great for a quick bite... oh, Colleen C. already beat me to this terrible pun.Luckily the food here is much better than that pun.I had the ""Dear Jong."" It's the Korean Beef Sandwich on a sesame bun with wasabi mayo, tempura onions, marinated bean sprouts. It was quite delicious.This place is also vegan/veg friendly. My gf had the Falafel salad plate Romaine heart, cucumber, red onion, and bell pepper salad with some sort of vinaigrette, hummus, olives, mushrooms, house made falafel, and pita sans tomato. It had everything! Mmm.Sadly, I did not see the specials board before ordering. Everything on there sounded amazing, so take a quick look so you don't miss out on the extra options, not on the menu.Parking is a breeze in this area. I also believe it is BYOB"
"Went there last night before going to a show at the Empty Bottle.  I was a huge fan!  The place is pretty small, but it just feels cozy rather than packed.  We brought a couple of bottles of wine (place is BYOB) and they had glasses for us and the bottle uncorked pretty much as soon as we sat.   My recommendation is the pork shank.  It was fantastic--crispy outside, fall off the bone, very flavorful.The prices... very reasonable.My only complaint--the place doesn't take reservations (that's fair enough), but after we put our name on the list, the person said she would be too busy to call us once a table opened up and we had to keep calling them every 10 minutes.  It was just odd as the place isn't that big..."
"Love this place. Food is excellent and I always go for the specials. I normally come in on weekday afternoons, weekend brunch crowds just scare me. But hell, if the number one review about a place is that its ""too busy,"" then I don't see what the problem really is. It just means it s a great place. The staff is always really nice and super friendly, I always appreciate that. Oh, coffee is pretty stellar too. Dark Matter, I believe. Just do yourself a favor and go here!"
"AH! I'm not sure if my measly vocabulary can explain how gooooooooooooooood this place was.  We ordered the meatball starter (yum yum fat fat)-Shared the pesto pasta and burger (I am still dreaming about that burger...and drooling at the thought of it!)Also tried a bite of the salmon special of the evening (also probably the best I've ever had).Shared the cookie & ice cream dessert (yum yum fat fat), had a bite of the banana fritters (EVEN BETTER)...and now I want go back and eat until I need to go up a dress size.Chef Rodney deserves a gold star :)FYI, the space is tight and gets really loud, so if you're not in the mood for a lively atmosphere, go early :)"
"I'd never noticed Bite Café, but a coupon piqued my curiosity. It's a cozy, hip little BYOB café, and the staffers were very friendly the day we visited. The menu offers attractive options for all day, breakfast thru dinner. We were there for a late lunch, and it was hard to choose. I settled on a pulled pork sandwich with fries; the sandwich was very good and the fries had good flavor & nice brown color but were just a little limp. My companion's falafel gyro was tasty, but dry. I could see myself stopping in again if I was in the neighborhood."
"I really enjoy brunch here. Try something from the specials board, and devour some potatoes. It's cozy when there's snow and sunny when it's nice out. Great destination for a bike ride and a nice place to meet friends."
"Bite really was fantastic. They've renovated since the photos shown on Yelp; from what I can tell, they're much more vegetarian-friendly (although I am a meat eater). Super cute inside; small, but big enough. When I went, it wasn't crowded at all. The menu is brief, but there is still plenty of variety. I chose the Hangover Salad, which consisted of a generous serving of Frisse lettuce, bacon, some kind of crouton (brioche?) and a poached egg. The idea was to break the yolk over the lettuce and use it as a dressing. Slightly weirded me out initially but it was super delicious. I didn't have a hangover, but it hit the spot. My boyfriend got the Philly Cheese Fake, which is basically the traditional sandwich with portobello mushrooms substituting the meat. I tried some and it was wonderful! A great option for a vegetarian. Overall, I really enjoyed Bite. The staff was friendly, the atmosphere is modern and clean. The menu had interesting dishes, and all of them sounded quite tempting. I'll be back!"
"Seriously just so good. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Everything is made fresh daily. Small and quaint. Beautifully lit by tealight candles at night with low lighting. Great service and prices."
"If you're reading this on your way to Bite in a car and you do not have bottles of alcohol with you -- STOP at Ola's or D&D's to complete the meal that awaits you!My new favorite restaurant. For dinner had the farro to start, Amish chicken, Salisbury ""steak,"" fries on the side, and cheesecake? pound cake. What I love about Bite: -Great dishes you'd get at another restaurant for 2-3 times the price. Literally -- 1/2 Amish chicken is typically at least $25. At Bite? $14.-Not only is the place super affordable, the plates unique, and the flavors great -- the portions are huge.-Of course, BYOB.-It was Monday and the place was packed.-Best server I've ever had. Didn't get her name, but genuinely friendly without a hint of fakeness or on the job routine.-Awesome hours. Would totally go back for breakfast, brunch, lunch, or late night. I love this place. Minus one star for their awkward bathroom in the kitchen."
"I joined Yelp simply to spread the gospel of the Bite fried chicken leg sandwich. Insanely delicious. Went in on a Tuesday afternoon and really like the new atmosphere and decor. It feels a lot more comfortable in there than the old Bite. It's changed enough that I don't quite get why they didn't rename it altogether.We were started off with a great plum coffee cake with fresh cream. I'd looked at the menu ahead of time and knew I was going to get the fried chicken leg sandwich; we also went with the poutine and a ham stack special.All was really tasty, but that sandwich still lingers in my mind. I'll be going back soon for it. The poutine was as good as I've had outside of Toronto, though I could've used still more cheese...but that's life as a cheese fiend.The ham stack was anchored by a mash brown...the ""what is a mash brown question"" was answered deliciously by it turning out to be a fried mashed potato patty. It was good enough to be ordered a la carte and enjoyed sans accoutrement. That fried chicken leg sandwich, though. Tender, crispy, perfect bread, perfectly spiced slaw. I could eat one daily. Go get you one.Though there wasn't really room, we also finished off a butterscotch pot de creme and some fresh strawberry ice cream which was mind-blowing. I'm not usually one for desserts but I'd have both again."
"I've seen that some people have said the service here is terrible, I have yet to experience that. The couple times I've been there, the staff has been friendly. Maybe not overly friendly, falling over you to fill your coffee after 2 sips, but when they come by, they are very friendly, and they come by enough that your coffee doesn't go empty, but not so often that you can't take a bite because they are always coming by to add a drop of coffee to your cup.I've had a couple different brunches here, most recently the breakfast burrito w/ chorizo. Very good. My girlfriend had the veggie omlet and thought that was very good as well. We each had breakfast, and 2 cups of coffee, for $20. Not too bad. Also, it's BYOB if you want to bring some in with you. And one time I was there, we could go next door to the empty bottle, order drinks from their bar, and bring them in to the dining room.The place is pretty cool, with a mis-match group of tables, and sometimes cool/sometimes weird art on the wall. I have yet to wait for a table when I go in there."
I've only been here for breakfast/brunch. I recommend sitting at the counter (Chicago needs more diners with counter seating!!). Always have had great service and food's pretty tasty. I usually end up there with my vegan friend and he loves the tofu scramble.
"Sorry Bite I had to downgrade you.We went today for the first time since the remodel (which I had no clue had happened since we moved to another 'hood) for brunch. It was definitely more fancy shall we say in presentation, but the food that I ordered was just ok. I had the sweet potato hash.  HASH being the operative word and HASH it was not. Hash means shredded, sliced, definitely not cubed. And the cubes were undercooked! On top of these cubes of potato were two eggs, not overeasy as requested but over hard which I really don't like. There was a slice of sourdough, which was yummy, as well as some onions, red peppers, maybe spinach if I recall. That was it. It was boring, unflavorful and uninspired. I miss the Fidel omlette which was awesome.To be fair my fellow diners loved their meals, one had the special and the other two had the bruschetta. The mashed brown, or whatever that new potato thing is called is yuumy!As in my previous review the desserts was awesome. Rhubarb coffee cake yum! The decor is nice, definitely classier than the old Bite but that Cheers-everyone-knows-your-name-vibe is sadly gone.Service was dismal. We had to keep flagging down our waitress and the restaurant was by no means full. The friendly, attentive waiters we knew are probably long gone, along with the warmth and friendliness of the old Bite.  Probably won't make a special trip to come here anymore, but would drop by if we were in the neighborhood. I wonder what lunch and dinner are like..."
"Been there twice since they reopened and both times were pretty awesome. The first time was right after they reopened and I was with a group of 6 for brunch on a Sunday. The place is relatively small, but they did an awesome job of getting us all seated together. I really didn't think it would happen.The second time I stopped in was a late morning during the week. Much more chill, only a few tables and maybe one person at the counter. The food was still good. I generally don't ever eat potatoes, but their ""mash brown"" was delicious.I found out they have a late night menu so more greasy gross food at midnight. Not sure what's on the menu, but I will definitely be trying it out."
"We used to live around the corner a couple of years ago and really liked this spot, but always left smelling of breakfast.Game Changer! They made some changes inside and it was the great food I remember but I smelled like me and not them when I left.  Service was friendly, coffee was great, and the food was delicious.I always appreciate the different spins on a traditional breakfast.  It's small and fun inside, so if I had a big group 4+ I'd say no go unless your early eaters.  Waiting for a table can be......uncomfortable but in the spring/summer easy wait outside."
Please put pork shank back on the menu and I will give 5 star
"I still love this place!Artsy in feel, it's maybe not the ideal place to bring your uptight mom... but if you're OK with feeling like you're in hipster central at a place with great food, this is the place..If you order off the menu, the entrees are around $8 or $9.  The menu is good, but the chalkboard menu for dinner is where it's at... still.  the chalkboard entrees have gone up slightly in price noticeably over the past year or so, but most things are still $13 on average...  and usually there's one (like a steak dinner) for $15ish.  I *always* ask what the best thing on the chalkboard is and they're pretty honest about it.It's BYOB with no corkage fee.  Though if you don't feel like BYOing, they're connected internally via a door to the empty bottle, so you can go next door and buy a bottle or glass of wine, a drink, etc (that door locks at 9pm though).I love the place, I'd seriously put it as one of my favorite restaurants in chicago.  And I'm not just saying that because it's across the street from where i live :]bigbitesite.com is their web site, though it seems like that's their catering site? (who knew they catered?)... they have a verrry long list of items they can make for catering, i have a feeling a lot of the chalkboard items somehow derive from a lot of those things...   Actually the empty bottle's site also has their menu, though they just changed their printed menu last week so that version is at least two versions outdated now... emptybottle.com/bite.htm  .. ...but not too different at the same time from what the printed menu is now.They have a chalkboard of desserts which are always worth getting in my book... they're $4 or 5 now... some great fantastic stuff can be found sometimes on the dessert chalkboard.  i always try to save room, and if i don't have room i annoy them by asking for it to go.My favorite thing on the printed menu are the corn cakes with bbq pork and dill pickles (you HAVE to eat it with the pickles at the same time for the full experience!), which comes with a potato choice as well.  And it's $8.  Though my friends ordered that last time we were there and weren't crazy about it... it used to be pulled pork, and it was better then.. now it's chopped pork...  I still like.They have art on the walls that rotates monthly or every few weeks with local artists selling their work.That said, it is a bit funky and you have to have expectations before you go.... it's very artsy/bohemian feeling...  Your mom might have a heart attack if she has to use the bathroom, which you access by walking into the kitchen.  And occasionally I'm not crazzzy what i get, maybe 1 out of 5 meals will be a slight miss for me, but given the price I still find it to be a great place.  Sometimes the people:server ratio isn't quite what it should be, like if there's only the guy or girl working the whole restaurant, but even so it's reasonably fast, yet if you're ""new"" you might feel like you were getting rude service maybe.  My friend held a birthday party of about 20 people here though, and it was just the guy working, and he did a pretty great job keeping everyone in the restaurant happy..They do brunch as well as dinner... personally I think their brunch is quite good and I go there once in awhile for it, but the dinner is a mile ahead of brunch.  If you want the standout experience go for dinner, not brunch...  (though on their new brunch menu they have corncake pancakes with bacon and a maple butter that is pretty tastey... Ooyee!"
"The decor of Bite is adorable, nice windows, colors of the furniture, etc.  The food was great, too! I had the Veggie Muffaletta, it was delicious.  My only complaint was that the bathroom was in the kitchen, and I absolutely hate that, personal preference.  Regardless, I will be back and I'm glad it made a comeback!"
"I love this place!!!! I really do. there is never a wait. I deduct a star because you have to get your booze from the empty bottle in order to have booze here, which is kind of lazy and sad on their part. either let your customers byob or have some decent drinks on the list. though I'm sure there are complexities and costs involving liquor law. anyway, I LOVE BRUNCH here ... it is quiet and beautiful. the servers are nice. they are cooler than me. the dinner is outrageous reasonable for the quality of the food. and i love the location -- next to the empty bottle. don't miss it."
"Another hipster joint and the menu was extremley limited. I did however enjoy the schnitzel, I thought that was pretty good the risotto ok. The mash potatoes were amazing also the brussel sprouts. But I felt this was plan basic food a bit over priced and there was nothing unique about this place not even the food on the menu. The waitress was down to earth and helpful. By the way they have strong coffee that's a plus in my book ;)"
"Just left Bite Cafe and felt the need to come home and write a review since it was really worthy of a good one.  We went in for a late dinner and having never been before but always pass on out way home we decided to give it a try and were pleasantly surprised.  We started with the poutine and have never had such a creation and while it's probably better for a hangover cure it was a great starter.  I followed it with the special filet mignon which for $20 was a steal, cooked to perfection and served with a loaded baked potato and wedge salad.  My boyfriend went with the lighter side and had the hangover salad which he liked a lot.  We finished off our meal with the sinful brownie ala mode which was perfect!   all and all the only reason why I didn't go with 5 stars is because I have never given 5 stars and it would probably take some live entertainment to do so.  Besides that the vibe was very homey and inviting and not at all pretentious."
"Seems like everyone brunches here but my first experience was actually for a late dinner and  omggg it was SO GOOD. Literally salivating at the mouth thinking about it. First of all, our waitress was incredibly funny and gave great suggestions. Other than that the food was fantastic. I ordered the Parisian gnocchi and it was one of the best gnocchis I have ever had.  Very light yet creamy and full of delicious veggies.  and no worries, there was no skimping on portions! The other people I was with had the Chicken Paillard which was also delicious. I didn't try the Mussels but everyone said they were great.  Lastly, there was another veggie pasta dish special...some sort of pesto thing and it was so good. A really great option for vegetarians. Only complaint  was that I had to use the neighboring bar to order drinks and use the restroom. Restroom sorta grossy since there was live music going, but whatever I would recommend this place to anyone."
"If I could eat there everyday I would. Brunch is a must. Poutine is Ahhh mazzingg. If you're looking for a lighter bite, I suggest the beet salad which is tangy and satisfying. All sandwiches in my opinion have been mediocre- so is falafel- but it's a no-fail for brunch items. Pork hash is perfect to nurse a hangover. The mussels are also a must try. Helps its a Byob, too."
"I've only eaten at Bite for brunch, and I'm always really happy with anything I order. The mashbrown is like a cross between a McDonald's hashbrown (in a good way) and mashed potatoes- YUM. Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Omelettes with any kind of mushroom are really, really good, and make sure to ask for jam for your toast- not sure if they make it in house, but it's quality stuff. Service can be slow, but I don't mind because the food is good! I would recommend it for sure."
"The artichoke fritters are the s@#t. Like, for real."
"If I had to pick a favorite place to eat in Chicago, Bite would most certainly be my choice. I was a little scared when they closed for remodeling earlier this year, but I need not have been worried. Bite came back better than ever, even though a few old menu favorites had bitten the dust (like the veggie burrito...R.I.P, veggie burrito). I have been eating at Bite for about 10 years now. I'll admit that I don't get terribly adventurous, in part because I love their hamburgers (even more since the reopening). The salad with grilled tofu added is also fantastic and for breakfast, you can't beat the sweet potato hash. Bite gets extra points from me for consistently wonderful desserts (please bring back the butterscotch pot du creme!). Bite has always just felt cozy to me and though it feels like home, it also somehow makes me feel like I'm on a road trip every time. All in all, the new and improved Bite is still top on my list. The new late night hours make me love them even more."
"This place was AMAZING.  It is small and packed, but we only ended up waiting 15 minutes on a Sunday morning which is not bad at all for brunch in the city. Service was great. I had Eggs Duncan, hubby had Pork Hash.  Both were amazing and we can't wait to go back for more!"
"Joined my sis here last weekend and it was a very pleasant experience.  I arrived far before sis, but they had no issue asking me to be seated and get started on coffee while I wait.  This is a luxury narrowly afforded at brunch spots near downtown (they usually banish you to the corner if your ""entire party"" is not ready to be seated.  Very quaint and casual atmosphere that is as welcoming as its staff.  This is definitely a spot to meet 3 or 4 friends for brunch or lunch. My waiter and another staffer checked in on me occasionally, without overdoing it. When my sister arrived, we ordered the Pork Hash and the Eggs Duncan.The Hash stole the show with tender pulled pork shank smothered in a melange of potato, onions, corn and jalapeno peppers.  The spicy hollandaise added a complimentary punch of flavor and creaminess to the meat.  This dish was very well seasoned, piping hot, and topped by two perfectly poached eggs.The Duncan left us desiring more flavor.  The biscuits were old school cast iron style, fluffy and caky, but would have been on point with a tad more butter (come on, it was a country biscuit!). The creamed spinach and pea topping was an interesting combination of texture, but not one I'd repeat.  This mix also lack a great deal of flavor - we ordered more of the spicy hollandaise to help dress this Duncan. Again, the eggs were perfectly poached. I'd definitely return to try other menu items."
"Let me tell you a story. Once upon a time when I had first moved to Chicago in October 2003, I believe I went to Bite for brunch. It wasn't particularly memorable, so I hadn't gone back for years. Cut to my friend Kris S. (formerly Kris W.) telling me in 2006 or 2007 that her favorite restaurant in Chicago was Bite. I decided to give it another try and lo-and-behold, she was right. Now I have a standing date at least once a month but usually twice a month, at Bite. Absolutely the only problem I have with Bite is that the recent menu change took off my beloved orecchiette dish. The bi bim bop with tofu is definitely my new go-to and I do love it, but I pine for the days of my pasta with raisins, pine nuts, chili oil. It's okay because the specials change nightly, so if I'm not feeling bi bim boppy, I'll go with a poultry or veggie dish off the chalkboard. If you're wavering between a special or a menu item, ALWAYS go with the special because you don't know if it will be up on the board again! Ask the waiters what's good if you are on the fence. Andy is our favorite.Last I heard, Kirsten Anderson, formerly of Glazed Donuts (R.I.P.), was still making all the sweets, so TRY to save room because they are excellent!"
"Super cute place, good food and friendly staff...but they'll ask you to leave shortly after dropping the check if there's a table waiting. Also, the bathrooms are pretty nasty since they're shared with the bar next door..."
"Bite was the epitome of just ok. They have a few veggie options and good OJ. I have been on a scrambled tofu kick and I was not really satisfied with theirs... It wasn't marinated or anything and was pretty bland. The Soyrizo hash had potential but it lacked, well,  Soyrizo...   I was hungry soon after.The server was great and the space is cute... maybe a meat eater would have much better luck here."
"We were starving and had a long night ahead of up, so three of us grabbed a late lunch at Bite. It was OK. Our server was great...a kind, friendly guy who joked with us. I started off with the soup of the day (mushroom lentil) and it was hearty, warm and good. I opted for the grilled cheese with ham, and it was OK. If you're a grilled ham lover, you'll enjoy the thick slab that they squeezed between the bread. For me, it was a little overpowering and -- for lack of a better word -- hammy. I had to remove it. I guess I'm more a deli style girl at heart. The fries were good, but had wished I'd ordered the sweet potato fries. They looked tasty. Bite served it's purpose. I ate, filled up, and was able to sustain any further hunger pains till I was able to eat again around 10:30."
"I can't speak highly enough of Bite.  This is one of my new favorite spots.  I had the Philly Cheese Fake because I love mushrooms.  The sandwich was so good.  I ordered a side salad instead of fries, and that, unfortunately, was underwhelming.  In all honesty it seemed like one of those bagged lettuce mixes from the grocery store with a viniagrette I could make at home.  There weren't any other accoutrements.My friend had the steak and potatoes.  At first when she ordered she asked for her steak medium-well, and I shuddered in horror.  Thankfully the waitress and I were able to convince my friend to have her hanger medium rare.  She was really happy with it.  The roasted fingerling potatoes on the side were perfect:  crisp on the outside, creamy on the inside.  (Why is it so hard for restaurants to roast/fry potatoes properly?!)  There was also a side of pickled cauliflower and carrots, reminiscent of what you get at Mexican restaurants.  It was really tasty and the vegetables had a slightly crunchy texture, but they weren't raw.We finished off with the lemon panna cotta, which is heaven on a plate.  It had the right amount of lemon for that tang you want from lemon without being overpowering."
"Bite Cafe is an adorable neighborhood joint. The food is of excellent quality and the service is casually friendly. The regular menu is quite small; however, everything is AMAZING. They always have specials which are handwritten on a chalkboard above the kitchen."
"We went here for Sunday breakfast: super friendly and fast service, cheaper, decent food with good portions.  Good variety of the regular and the unusual: I was scratching my head over the carrot cake covered with peanut butter and service with eggs and spinach combo (should have gotten it!).   Love the menus served in old schoolbook covers.    Definately have to come back for other meals of the day.Update 5/08: Happy birthday to Crister C, he took over the place and made it fabulous for one moment in time."
"I was a fan of the old bite, really good food, never had to wait to sit for brunch, so it was often our go to place when we were starving on the weekends.We went to the new and improved Bite for a friends b-day brunch.  we had about 8 people, so we knew we were going to wait awhile.  Happily we could wait next door at Empty Bottle and had a few cocktails as we waited for our table.  Food was delicious, service was better, I can't wait to go back again!"
"The new and improved Bite Cafe is just that!  If you haven't been since they revamped it, or have never been I recommend that you go. The new menu has a ton of great options, they serve Dark Matter Coffee and just started making ice cream!"
"I don't have anything remarkable to say about this lil' place. I worked right next door for a year or so and never stopped in, after eating there this morning, I don't take that as a total loss.Don't get me wrong, the food was fine, the service was exceptional, the music was great. Well, it was thursday morning at 10, I would expect if you were serving breakfast during a weekday you would be on your a-game.The coffee was limitless, I had the cornbread french toast which was just enough to be energizing. I prefer this in a sweet breakfast. Too many times you go for the sweet choice and you walk out half asleep hoping to get home as soon as possible to take a nap.I'm eager to try this again, and this time go for a savory option, so that MEANS something. Upon first impression though, above average but not a mindblower."
"I once had an ecstatic experience after eating one of their veggie burritos. I think it was the excitement of coming to Bite then going to the Empty Bottle for their (R.I.P.) Jazz Fest. Or maybe one of the hipster chefs had slipped a different kind of mushroom in the burrito!Been back recently before playing a show at the Bottle, and partook of the Specials menu, which is actually 2x as expensive as the ""real"" menu. I was very happy with my order, and the seasonal three-berry pie was killer. Since I was dining alone the service wasn't altogether great, but the food was!"
Dang this place is good. We had a 25 min wait on a Sunday (standard) but it was nice being able to walk next door to the empty bottle to get a drink while we waited.  The poutine was great and the braised short rib sandwich was pretty good too.  Only thing with the sandwich was the sourdough bread got a little soggy from the pork. Still very tasty.
Chicken Leg Sandwich. I am in love with you.
"I'll start off with the food. It was hit and miss for me and the Mrs. House salad - Basic leaves with a few other items in it. Vinaigrette dressing was boring without much taste. Snoozefest but not horrible either. Bite Burger - I agree with a previous reviewer that had a charred taste (I ordered it Medium) but the fries were pretty good, but not incredible, like my jokes. Oh well. No flavor to the meat or cheese.  The bun was good. I like buns. Mac 'n Cheese - The Mrs. had this and it was pretty decent. She liked it more than me, which is what matters.  It's definitely not worth going back for and not even in the realm of what other Chitown places like Kuma's Corner serve. Almost really good, but not quite, like my jokes. Let's continue.  Apple Spice Cake (dessert) - Very good!  Finally, something with some life served to us. It was sweet, rich, and flavorful.  Great with coffee or a chai on a cold night.  At least our boring meal ended on a high note. So far the meal was like shopping at a thrift store - kinda boring but with some interesting highlights. In the end, we didn't come away with much to write Mommy about.  Sorry Mommy, no letter for you this month!  The mail goes both ways you know! Service - This is where I disagree with some of the reviewers below. Or server was acting way too overwhelmed for only working 4-5 small tables. He could barely keep himself at our table without running away. What's up with that?  We're nice, quick to decide on food, etc.  We later discovered the reason for his hurried state. He wanted to get off his shift to catch his pals play at the Empty Bottle next door.   We saw him later when we went to the show. Sooooo, that's why you are acting so squirrelly.  Sorry we kept you busy at Bite, but we came to eat then checkout the show.  While working, he also found time to talk to his gal pal in the booth who was waiting for him to get off his shift.  Nice for her, not fun for us. This is why our waters weren't refilled once during the meal. Or why my coffee went cold, again, with no refills. At one point in the meal, our server came to our table and dramatically paused, opened his hand then closed it in a ""compose myself""  gesture to center himself, then asked if we wanted dessert. Eye of the Tiger, dude. You need to get it.    Also, in a dramatic move, he spilled the a chai drink while putting it down on the table. It spilled on the table, onto the floor, and onto the Mrs.' funky scarf which was sitting on her purse.  The server said ""Shit!"" and ran off, acting like he'd be back to clean it up. Actually, he didn't come back to clean the table, floor or my wife's scarf. He ran off to service other tables for the next 15 minutes. He forgot all about his spill. Realizing getting help with cleanup was a lost cause, we had to flag him down in mid-trot to ask for more napkins so we could minimize the chai stickyness. He literally ring-tossed the napkins onto our table as he ran by in a fake panic. At least he had better aim this time and the napkins landed safely.  To sum up this review, we wouldn't recommend going out of your way to visit Bite Cafe. The food isn't worth it (maybe we should have had something else?). The service isn't worth it (from our experience during one visit). We'd only come here again if we were starving before seeing a show at the Bottle and couldn't eat at one of the 100 other better joints in the 'hood. Oh well.- Edited to shorten review and to make it less personal."
"I love Bite! Great first/always date place, cheap.....cute, cozy, little do-dads that make it engaging.I have been here several times; with co-workers, dates and girlfriends. It is a fantastic BYOB, incredible, perfectly portioned, unique menu items. The menu choices at the Very cheap prices are incredible. For two of us, our bill was $14.50 for a Friday night dinner. I ate the Corn cakes with queso frenco and pickled red onions. Bam! I seriously am in heaven, and this is absolutely my new favorite food. We also had the Red Mac & Cheese With cheddar, parmesan, and goat cheese and guajillo salsa - which pretty much tasted exactly like you would think..... There are so many more choices, and their full menu is not on their website! Don't forget to go next door to the empty bottle for a night cap :)"
had brunch here the other day.  Had a delicious Pork Hash- took a step out of my comfort zone to give Spicy Hollandaise a try.  Well worth the risk.  Overall a very satisfying breakfast.  Will definitely be back!
The good: 1. Nice friendly service2. Location3. DecorThe bad: 1. Not much in the way of taste on my bacon & egg sandwich2. cold home fries3. orange juice was most certainly created with minute-maid concentrate4. cold home fries (did I mention for both of us?)I'll give this place another shot I'm sure - it's close to my house and I think that one bad day can't be a good indicator of a restaurant.  I'll go with the more daring items next time - maybe that's what they do well.  Here's hoping that next time I'll have a better experience.
"Tastiness.  I had the cornbread French toast topped with maple syrup, blueberries and cinnamon butter (mmmmm!), my dining companions had 1) scrambled eggs, yogurt + granola + fresh blueberries and 2) the breakfast burrito w/ pinto beans on the side.  Everyone was happy.  Cornbread French toast is a new concept for me, which I enjoyed verrrry much (maybe not as much as regular French toast though) and the butter was delish.  I stole some of my friend's granola (homemade--very flavorful with tangy dried fruit) and my boyfriend's burrito (savory tomatoes and chives, sour cream, eggs and was that potato too? couldn't tell, I was scarfing it down/he was trying to get it back from me).We spent about 2 hours there.  Cozy ambiance, slow service, but an overall good place to laze away indoors on a chilly, sunny Sunday afternoon."
If you go here for brunch get the Bi Bim Bop! I've been here a few times and every time I want to try something new but my belly heads right to the Bi Bim Bop! A combination of flavors I've never had before = party in my mouth. My boyfriend had the biscuits and gravy. I tried it. Also very good. Service is so so. Depends on who you get. There is one guy who is really cool but the lady who works the front desk on the weekends can sometimes come off as having an attitude (I'm gonna chalk it up to they're really busy). Definetly a must try if you're in the neighborhood. I promise the food will not disappoint.
"I live nearby and have eaten at Bite at least a dozen times, before and after it came under new management and changed its menu. I have to say that I miss the old, more casual Bite, but new Bite is pretty good, too. I usually get the mussels, which are pretty good (but not as good as Rootstock's), or the burger (ditto- but its cheaper here). When its not too busy, the ambiance here is great, so I would recommend coming on a weeknight or for an early brunch. Otherwise, there's no place to wait, and the service can get a little spotty. I like that though its BYOB, you can just pop over to the Empty Bottle for beer or wine. Overall, its a decent neighborhood spot, but I don't know that I would travel far to eat at Bite."
"If you don't like this place, its probably because you hate flavorWalking in the door, I recalled this place from a previous visit about 7 years ago. I like it because they haven't buckled under the pressure to change with the neighborhood.I had the Moroccan chicken served with ""harissa"" sauce (a red pepper sauce) served on a plate of cous cous, a dollop of baba ganoush and some tzki tzki sauce. Three picked string beans accompanied the dish. The beans were quite tasty. I had a a ""summer"" slaw on the side which was like a traditional slaw but with vinegar instead of mustard.  I actually ordered some slaw to go, it was that good.Chimichurri skirt steak. The chimichurri was not finely chopped, more coarsely chopped, that added texture and more flavor to the already juicy steak. I don't mind that this place is small and the staff is angry.  It's like teen-angst that never went away and now they're in their mid-30s. I like that you can go next door to The Empty Bottle and buy booze and drink it at your table.  Expect to be uncomfortable, but expect a damn good meal.  But just remember, you're in a small cafe on Western Ave. don't expect Blackbird if you're paying $12.95 for dinner."
I've eaten here a few times now and have found that Bite offers a decent  Vegan/Vegetarian option. I'm partial to their tofu hash/scramble. Bite is a good breakfast option on the weekends and I usually bring my non-veg friends from out of town here.
"After coming for dinner twice in recent months, I think I like the idea of Bite Cafe more than what it actually is. Don't get me wrong -- I'm quite a fan, but I do feel like there is room for consistency and improvement. Their being a BYOB probably adds a whole star on its own. But a good friend lives nearby so this is always a consideration when in UKV.My first visit was fantastic! The Parisian gnocchi is delicious and is mixed with fresh veggies. Compared to otherwise ""normal"" gnocchi, this one is incredibly creamy and tender, full of flavor -- not as chewy as what I've encountered otherwise. I've sampled the mussels in a wine/butter sauce, and they were delicious.I've also had:Burger - pretty good (standard option), good friesPulled pork - pretty average, won't get it again. Underwhelming.Grilled pork chop - pretty good, worth trying (hefty chop portion)Judging from the other reviews, I need to try the brunch options. I also like the small size and decor of this cafe and the comfortably casual, conversational wait staff. It's very intimate and accommodating, and I am likely to bring others here based mostly on the neighborhood cafe energy, set up, and BYOB (did I mention that yet??). Their facebook page always tempts me with daily specials, and I'm sure I'll be back again soon to try something new alongside another dish of gnocchi."
"I went here for the first time in probably four years.  They have expanded their menu with a variety of things.  Food was great, cute atmosphere, great service, free parking on western and BYO is always a plus!"
"Yum. I've eaten here twice now. First brunch - Hangover Salad. More recently, dinner - I had a fish sandwich special with fries. Five stars for the food for sure. The sandwich was an inventive taste sensation with I think bread and butter pickles and Old Bay aioli. It was delectable.  My husband had some sort of special ""hot dog"" - quotation marks theirs that he said was delicious. My son had their Mac and Cheese which isn't my thing, but he ate it all and he is pretty picky. And my dill pickle was spiced with cloves- very special. The fries were great too. i love BYOB places for the obvious reasons. The other thing I love about this place is the very friendly, efficient service. We arrived at about 7:00 on a Wednesday (but July 3rd so kind of like a Friday) and were seated right away."
"The newly renovated Bite Cafe has hit the nail-on-the-head when it comes to making positive change to an old favorite. They have done an excellent job with cheering up the interior space. And the kitchen menu overall is simple, casual and downright good, at least for everything that we have tasted so far.The ricotta spread in a jar is served warm I give this one A+. The hangover salad with a poached egg - love it - I am always a sucker for egg yolks as a salad dressing. The sandwiches are huge, and can easily be shared if you have a few appetizers. Delicious handcut fries, a great selection of breads used on the sandwiches with fillings that are equally tasty. It is still BYOB, and if you forgot to bring something you can pop in next-door to the 'Empty Bottle' collect a beverage or two and return through the connecting internal door. Check it out it's cheap and super cheerful."
"Great brunch. You get to hang out in the Empty Bottle while you wait - talk about a place with character. Pros: Awesome menu, reasonable prices and great staff. Between the 3 of us we had the eggs duncan, monte cristo, and fried chicken sandwich, with biscuits and gravy and a mashbrown on the side. Everyone enjoyed. The gravy is delicious and bacon-flavored, and appropriately portioned atop a crumbly biscuit. The monte cristo was my first, and I loved the sweetness against the salty ham. For sure, this brunch is dense and heavy. I'll certainly return."
"Went here for my birthday brunch-it was awesome. Walking distance to my house is a big plus. Had really great veggie tacos and coffee.  My ladyfriend had tofu scramble which included a mashbrown....Normally I am not a fan of 'hashbrowns,' but this was something special.  Both of us really liked it here and will be back soon."
"After some Yelp research, my friends and I decided to try it last night for my roomie's birthday dinner.  She is a vegetarian, so she was very pleased with the menu options for her!  I am not, but I ended up ordering the Double Vegetarian Cheeseburger with regular fries instead of sweet potato fries.The burger was just okay.  It had a sort of burnt or bitter taste to it, which I haven't experienced with veggie burgers before, but it wasn't disgusting?  I ate most of it!  I did have a taste of my friend's Curried Squash Soup, which was one of the specials, and it was delicious.  Spicy and sweet all at once- yum.Our waitress was the pony tail girl with ironic glasses that a few other reviewers mentioned, and although she stayed pretty busy (she was the only server there that I could see), she was attentive enough.  I personally hate when waiters come to your table every 5 minutes to check on you and interrupt your conversation... just make sure my drink isn't empty and I'm good!  She was very friendly and accommodating with our check- we had a large group with some people paying cash and some using cards, and she was cool about that, which I appreciated.No corking fee for the BYO.I'll definitely try it again sometime!"
"One of the better hidden gem breakfasts I have had in quite some time. Awesome special pound cake with apple cinnamon butter. My lady got a chorizo w red pepper omellette which was awesome, these things called mashbrowns were awesome too. Mashed potato/hash brown hybrid? Solid breaktfast taco w pico and guac as well."
"My Favorite Chicago Restaurant.  The atmosphere is hipster but mostly inviting.  It's delightfully BYOB.  I always say go for the daily specials and you'll never go wrong.  I had the most delectable mustard-encrusted salmon, stewed lentils, sauteed spinach and beet salad with walnuts for only 14 bones.   Their desserts are def worth checking out, too, like sweet blueberry bread pudding ala mode. yum.  On a side note, I've been here several times and friends who order off the menu tend to be disappointed. Also, there is an occasional waitress there that can be a little rude.  If I had pierced cleavage, I'd probably be rude too, though.  Regardless, the amazing food is worth a sneer or two."
"OMG, delish food, kid friendly. Just love it - keep up the innovation, you do truly show that delicious food doesn't have to be complex or expensive. This is going to be my favourite place for a long time - I am probably not going to be happy until I try everything on the menu. I love the French windows and the people who work here - makes we want to get tattoo'ed and ride a bike :)"
"So I went to the newly re-vamped Bite Cafe for brunch on Sunday at about 10:30am with 3 other people...we had to wait a *long* time, and eventually gave up waiting to sit together and went 2 and 2 (after 2 older gentlemen sat at a 4-person table and were NOT reprimanded). I like the new decor and the addition of some bar stools was a nice touch(they definitely fixed the ventilation too, which was great!), but it feels much more like all the other brunch places now. The menu has fewer items, and some of my old favs are gone (granola pancakes are no more...), but they upped the gourmet level on the items that remain. The food was good, don't get me wrong. The server seemed totally overwhelmed, and I never got a coffee refill...that never happened at the old Bite. In conclusion, I fear that my favorite local brunch spot has turned into just  another yuppie brunch place...and I'm less inclined to wait for that."
"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Chicago. The bloody marys next door (you can order at Empty Bottle and walk 'em over to your table at Bite) are delicious and the breakfast burritos (with no egg, add seitan chorizo) are my absolute favorite vegetarian breakfast burritos in the whole wide world. The staff can be awesome friendly or rude aweful, so if when  Idon't feel like taking the risk then I order next door at the Empty Bottle and eat at the bar -- you can order from the full menu there too. All-in-all: great vegetarian selection, generally friendly service and pretty damn delicious."
"Another one Bites the dust.Cute place but now I know why it's not jam-packed like most breakfast joints on this Sunday.The so-so b-fast menu was seen before. Which is okay-- sometimes those classic staple items are exactly what breakfast should be about. But this time, an old classic took a wrong turn. I ordered the corned beef hash plate and when it arrived, I got huge chunks of beef mixed sauteed with onions, red bell peppers and potatoes. For once, I was expecting something that looked like dog food. I got something that was more like a beef fajita. Corned beef hash FAIL.The scrambled eggs and toast were good though. =/"
"Bite kicks ass. The constantly changing menu of specials (vegetarian and otherwise) is incredible for a place in that at-times-desolate stretch of Western Ave, where fast food and overpriced bodegas reign. My favorite regular-menu item is the proxy reuben, (hail seitan!) - made with incredibly prepared and seasoned wheat gluten, home made fries and - every time I have a cup I'm reminded - the best coffee in the neighborhood. The service is efficient, considerate, and, frankly, -real-, without pretension or attitude. Fast service from kind people - my favorite is the skinny bearded dude who's always working his ass off to the metal playing in the background - no matter how packed that place gets, he still pulls off the balance of being polite, thorough, and hilarious all at once!This is a real prize for the Ukrainian Village (that's where Bite is, btw, not Humboldt Park as the Yelp entry states). Check it out!"
"While I was hoping my first review on Yelp could be one of a positive nature, Bite had other ideas.I've been talked into going here more than I'd like to admit by my old lady, and for the most part the reason I wince at every Bite experience is because of the atrocious service, and not so much the below average food.Not this time.I'm never the guy to voice my displeasure at a meal and usually find something redeeming in what I order, but Bite truly challenges that mindset.  I started with the buffalo tofu appetizer, which bore almost no similarities to what one would think buffalo tofu to be.  The closest I could approximate the sauce to would be an unpleasant mix of soy sauce and sri-racha hot sauce w/o the hot.My actual meal was supposed to be grilled cheese and fries - hardly what one would call difficult to execute.  However, what emerged (after an initial order screwup) was a stale pile of bread with what seemed to be Kraft singles in between, and some fries that were barely cooked.  Finally all the iffy prior experiences at Bite welled up inside me and I decided it time to say no and send that pile of trash back.On the bright side, while the food was terrible it was the first time our waitress wasn't a completely vacant/horrible person and she removed the offending offal from the bill.  Here's to the little things.  If only Bite could score in both columns.  Sadly, I don't see that ever happening.I'm giving this review two stars because they did give me water without having to ask and my lady sort of enjoyed her meal - but she's a vegetarian so her tastes are bound to be a bit skewed ;-)If after this review you still insist on taking your chances, I'd advise calling ahead to see if what they list on their website menu is actually available.  It's been our experience that less than 1/3 of what's listed is really made in that kitchen."
"It's nice to see casual restaurants opening that have approachable, great food at reasonable prices.  I loved Bite Cafe.  I had the hangover salad sans hangover that was perfectly dressed and I finished every bite.  I followed it with the bucatini pasta that was cooked to al dente perfection.  The portion was generous and I'm happy to be having leftovers for dinner tonight."
"Great BYOB, I had the mussels & frites, with a side of brussels sprouts interesting menu I will be back.  Also I am glad to see brussels sprouts are appearing on a lot of menus."
"Yes!That is all.Ok. I guess it's not all. I like: books for menus.the exciting specials-board.sweet potato fries.denture-like logo.artwork by schoolkids on the walls.the food? it's pretty cheap. pretty good. pretty lovely. quite a bit of seitan here, fake chorizo, etc. the service? they tolerated my dining partner's ordering-uncertainty with a patient smile. twice. aw. admirable."
"Eh. I could go either way on this place. I'm not itching to get back bc more than one of the ppl working were way to ""cooler than you"" for my taste, and it's across the city from me, but I guess if I lived over there I'd be happy they exist? And luckily they sat us (a 6 top) pretty immediately on a Friday.The food came in a pretty decent amount of time and it was fine, there sweet potato fries are more like cute up sweet potatoes, no so much like fries.Whatever, I wouldn't be pissed if someone wanted to go there, but it's not on my list. I've always heard they were hella vegan, but they're not really, I'm sure they cook on the same grill as actual meat, and when I was asking what was vegan, I was told to just ""order something without cheese""....ok, thanks?"
"A friend of mine had wanted to try Bite Cafe for some time now. We went to check it out because she heard that they cater to vegetarians. We got there around noon, on a Sunday. It wasn't busy when we first got in, but after we sat down, a line started to form. The decor was very cozy, the space was incredibly cramped. The menu was printed on cardstock, however mine appears to have been previously used to wipe down coffee. The choices were limited. I ordered a cup of coffee for $2.50 and the Pulled Pork poach with mashbrown for $11.00. The service was great. My coffee cup was never empty. My meal was fantastic. The pull pork was jucy and tender, eggs were poached to perfection. I have never heard of mashbrowns before, but they are definitely excellent. Its not quite mash potatoes, not quite hasbrowns...just crispy chunks of goodness. There were brussel sprouts tossed in the mix, which seemed weird, but tasted fantastic with the mix. It's a must have. I will definitely visit again."
"i love this place.  my best friends introduced me and they talked it up for a long time.   bite did a fantastic job on the revamp - the decor, the food, everything.it's quaint and perfectly decorated - cute and rustic (it's hard to put those two together) and the garlic chicken is tasty and moist (i hate that word, but the only synonym i found is damp).  the wait staff is supes friendly and helpful. go early on the wknds for dinner, and you won't have to wait too long."
"Decided to come for Saturday brunch. My egg sandwich with bacon was fantastic!! the bacon was cooked just the way I like it, crispy but not overcooked.  The home fries were out of this world. I love the seasoning. Highly suggest to order something off the chalk board as well. Side note, its nice that if there is a wait, after 12pm you can hang out at the empty bottle and they will come and get you when your table is ready!"
"I ate here today and found the food to be ordinary, the art uninteresting, the decor cute, the service decent and the cute menus in book covers.I ordered the Veggie Double Cheeseburger (not sure why) with a salad and the balsamic seeped everywhere on the plate, thus being absorbed by the bottom bun - which I hated.  My friend also told me the sweet potato fries were good but the waitress failed to hear the ""seitan"" part of his reuben order, so he had to wait for a meatless version to come out.  Not a huge problem, but the waitress was kind of a bitch about it.It was just under $20 for a coffee, appetizer (buffalo tofu - tangy but good) and two entrees.  A forgettable meal but I also didnt hate it."
"What most maybe don't realize, is that Bite Cafe has been in the neighborhood a long time.  I would say over 10 years.  I would go there with my boss for lunch breaks when I was nineteen working at a recording studio.  Yes, Ukrainian Village has been cool long before hipsters rolled in.  10 years ago it was good, but not super good.  It declined to be sort of boring and bland.  Last weekend, I heard it was under new owners and we walked over to check it out.  Blew me away.  Completely re-decorated, awesome cute staff, and the food was fan-fukin-tastic.  Go check it out and you'll be surprised.  We had brunch so I would go back and check out the rest of the menu.  Whoever the new owner/chef is, congrats on a job well done.  And any place that has cute brunettes with tattoos serving coffee and food is ok in my book....but really...a good place."
"I was introduced to Bite by a friend who lived nearby, about three years ago.  Everything I've had there has been fresh and delicious; it's never off my radar for long, even though I don't live terribly close by. The boy and I went last Saturday, for brunch; I had the cornbread French toast (asked for the fresh blueberry sauce - with whole berries in it - on the side; I like just a little, and apparently it usually comes pre-poured.  That would've been blueberry overload for me.)  Sweet Jesus, was it delicious...fantastic texture too.  The butter on the side was cinnamon achiote, and it was amazing. We ordered a piece of plum upside down cake to go, and devoured it later that day.  Mmmm.  I found myself in need of dinner tonight, and decided to go back to Bite.  I had the house-made watermelon lemonade, and a double veggie cheeseburger, which was one of the best veggie burgers ever to pass these lips.  For a side dish, I tried the summer slaw - cabbage, zucchini, and carrots (I think) with a lovely vinegary sauce.  That would have ordinarily been more than enough...but since I'm pregnant (that's an acceptable excuse, right?) I ordered dessert too.  Cherry cornbread cobbler a la mode.  It was marvelous. I generally am not one to eat until I'm stuffed...but as I sit here, three hours after my dinner, I couldn't suck in my stomach if you paid me.  I have a food baby AND a regular baby in there.  And you know what? I'd do it all over again. P.S. I have only ever had one server at Bite - a woman with glasses and a ponytail, I believe.  She was perfectly delightful and very attentive."
"I have been like 3 times since it has reopened and I like the makeover. The hangover salad, breakfast poutine, french toast, daily scrambles...they are all delicious. My last experience over the weekend wasn't the best (cold food, loud children.) but when I went during the week it was the besst. So I will just think of Bite as a delicious weekday brunch spot."
"This is one of my semi-regular brunch spots, and I've never had a bad dish.  I highly recommend the hash, chorizo or seitan; the specials are usually reliable as well.  The only dish I was kind of meh on was the bacon cornmeal pancakes (I know, they sound great in theory, but the bacon doth not stay crispy in them thar pancakes!)I've only been once for dinner and I don't have a good reason why; I got the special which was a butternut squash risotto and it was delicious, and reasonably priced.The only low point?  The wait staff can sometimes be kind of dippy.  Not mean or snooty or anything, just kind of... space cadets."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants as a vegetarian. Basically, just order the special from the board and you will not be disappointed. Admissions: your clothes will smell like kitchen after leave, and if I weren't friends with the waiter that a lot of people on here bitch about, I'd say that he can be off-putting at moments. Some find the bathroom's location (in the kitchen) disconcerting, but it never occurred to me that that might be a problem until reading others' reviews. Other than that, the fact that it's BYOB, that the Bottle is right next door (and accessible through a door in the restaurant for easy drink transporting), that the food is cheap and without fail delicious, and it's not in a douche-bag part of the city means that Bite pretty much kicks ass. Just make sure to respect the ""air-lock"" provision during the winter. You'll get fewer glowers from the patrons, and probably better service from the wait-staff."
"The Bite Burger is one of the best I've ever had.  The food is consistently good, though I'm not a fan of the healthy breakfast foods (i.e. granola pancakes).  I love the breakfast potatoes, too.  It does get quite loud during peak times (esp. weekend mornings), but it's a good mixed crowd.  The menus have character and the ever-rotating original artwork is a nice touch keeping things fresh.  This is a slow-moving place, so don't come if you're in a rush.I'd like to mention the bathroom.  It's small, cold, and crappy, but I love walking though the kitchen on the way to the bathroom.  It's a cool kitchen and the cooks are sweet."
"Brunch here is good, innovative, and reasonably priced.  Service is friendly.  Atmosphere is undeniably hipster.  The unusually good coffee is a find, but don't ask to purchase any of their special blend... apparently it's a closely guarded secret."
"what a great place! the service was average but the food was quite good- i am a biscuit snob, as all southerners are.  i am always wary of ordering buttermilk biscuits bc they are inevitably disappointing and induce a severe bout of homesickness.  however, these guys nailed it!  flaky goodness.  the portion sizes are gigantic so you should go hungry (or hungover).  i had the pork hash- pork was well done, the butternut squash was a little undercooked and raw but the rest of it was quite nice-all the best fall veggies together in one place!  my friend had the fried chicken sandwich which i assume was delicious b/c he finished it before i could even ask to try it!!  wish i had read reviews beforehand and realized it was byob but will be good to know for next time!"
"I went for the first time tonight with a friend and we were pleasantly surprised by their vegetarian offerings. The food was great, the staff was very friendly and attentive, and the ambiance was just right. We were too full for dessert but that menu looked tasty as well. I will surely be back to try their brunch!"
"Hip cafe offering a mix of veggie and meatetarian cuisine. Although I would definitely classify this as veggie-focused, with options than can be made non, rather than the more common inverse. We tried the veggie double cheese burger and cubano. Loved both. I'd skip the sweet potato fries - they were tasty but gave me some nasty gut rot later on. The cafe is attached to the Empty Bottle, which seems like it has shows almost every night. The drink situation is confusing - the cafe itself doesn't serve, but you can go into the venue to order a drink. But only until nine? And the bartender may or may not be there. Not sure if it's BYO, but it probably should be given the hassle. People seem to have a lot of issues with the service but our server was fine. For sure she had a personality, but I didn't think she was snobby. Maybe people just expect sauciness from hipsters. Anyway she was super prompt with everything, so no complaints there. Only about a dozen tables, so I would expect a wait especially on nights with bigger shows.  I recommend going to the restroom before you get there. It's back in the kitchen, and the close proximity to the food made me a little squeemish. Good thing I went after I ate...?"
"I was pleasantly surprised at how awesome Bite was! It's not that I wasn't expecting good...I just did not expect to enjoy my meal SO much for trying a new place. I had a squash risotto that was to die for. It was delicious and flavorful, hard to get with a vegetarian option sometimes. I brought my 1 yr old daughter here and she loved the atmosphere. Lots of friendly people is her kind of crowd. I hope to be back soon!"
"If you like...-taking the smell of restaurant home with you on your clothes, hair, purse and shoes-flaky service-getting the wrong meal that you did not order-getting to take home the meal you did not order and still get the one you DID order-byob-and the Empty Bottle next door if you don't have your own b-being cold indoors in winter-avocado cream sauce-chicken fried steak-Cramped quarters-cheap food-good cheap food-REALLY good cheap food...then you should go to Bite."
"I have Aurore L. and Yelp to thank for helping me discover this little gem. I am so glad I stumbled upon her critique/this recent review of the day and made the trip to Ukrainian Village a couple hours ago! I will burst if I ingest one more bite (no pun intended, promise) of -anything- for the rest of the night, but I couldn't be happier.... As the saying in Spanish goes - ""barriga llena, corazón contento""!*I went there considerably early (or at least early for me, since I tend to have dinner around 8-9pm) and was worried the place would be completely deserted, but luckily a few diners were present so it didn't seem like a no man's land. Loved the decor of the place - simple color scheme with splashes of blue (chairs+other elements of the decor), minimalist paintings on the walls, exposed brick... Very pretty. Oh, and I loved the fact that the restaurant was perfectly lit - not too dark that you have to squint to read the menu and are quasi-blind by the end of the meal, but on the other end of the spectrum - not too bright that you feel like you're in a McDonalds or something.For starters, my dining companion & I split the fish tacos (we missed the part that said they were $4 each, or else we would have ordered two!!) I can't believe I'm blanking on the exact ingredients that made up this special of the day..! I do distinctly remember, however, the spicy aïoli, which was absolutely fantastic. The fish was piping hot and lightly breaded, so not overly crispy... basically the fish tacos were spectacular.I barely glanced at the menu because after reading Aurore's review I knew I wanted one thing and one thing only: the mussels. I was fortunate enough to have lived in Lima for about 4 years or so and have enjoyed the most fantastic seafood in Peru. I am constantly looking to satisfy my craving for seafood in the US, and Bite Cafe definitely hit the spot. The steamed mussels were exquisite! And the broth... oh my don't even get me started... Kudos to the chef for concocting the rich, pumpkin-colored liquid goodness in which my mussels were drenched... It's already been mentioned before but I might as well reiterate it for my own sake (I'm going to attempt to emulate this at home) - garlic, leeks, bacon, smoked paprika Butter, and I'm assuming many splashes of white wine. If I didn't know for a fact that my dining companion would be mortified if I just started lapping up the broth that remained post-mussel consumption, I probably would have. My dining companion had the meatball sub with parmesan, provolone, and arugula (note to Bite owners: arugula is misspelled on the menu of the website). It looked decent, and he said it was pretty good but definitely not better than the fish tacos. For dessert, I had a few bites of my dining companion's fudge brownie. Good, but not anything out of this world. He was disappointed that it was served with a sort of a hazelnut sherbet instead of a proper, creamy ice cream. I wasn't too bothered by this fact but I guess a more rich ice cream would have been a more appropriate element to this classic American dessert. We both hated the brittle or English toffee that was on top of the brownie. When I go back (note how I say when and not if, I cannot stop reminiscing about those mussels and that superb broth...), I will probably try the spiced apple cake instead. I was intrigued by the pumpkin flan as well, as it matches 2 of my favorite things in the dessert category. Our waitress was very nice and courteous - I appreciated that she apologized profusely upon informing us that the kitchen didn't have mustard for our table. I was a tad disappointed, but then again mustard isn't a very common accompaniment for moules-frites I suppose. I still think Bite Cafe should have it for mustard lovers, just in case..! The only bizarre thing was the fact that to get to the bathroom you have to walk through the kitchen... I felt like I was intruding at first, but on my way back it was actually kind of exciting to catch a glimpse of the dishes being prepared. Can't wait to go back!!*(the closest idiomatic translation of the proverb above: A full stomach makes a happy heart)"
"I moved to Chicago around the first of June and I've been into Bite three times since. Granted, it's really close to my apartment, but the food is also really good, and the service I've had was really great. I've only ever had two particular servers - I'm guessing the ones who work in the mornings are not them ;D - so YMMV, but we definitely have our orders taken promptly and I was impressed with the vegetarian options and substitutions, although having been there several times, I've found that the thin-sliced seitan (used in sandwiches like the Reuben and the Pepper Steak) is in need of a little something - it's kind of dry. Definitely go for the chorizo seitan if you're a faux meat fan - it's good. Better yet, order off the board. The specials are almost always tasty and the better options. The soups are really good here, especially. The watermelon lemonade is FANTASTIC and the sweet potato fries were good.We always get the Buffalo Tofu - it's spicy, but I was impressed: as someone from Buffalo, the sauce is reasonably close to actual Buffalo wing sauce, rather than the sticky-sweet barbecue sauce or tomato-based hot sauce that seem to be the ubiquitous substitutes, and the tofu is pretty well cooked. I really haven't experienced any below average service, and always enjoy the food. Could some particular selections be stronger? Sure -- but I feel that way about a lot of other restaurants I've been to since my move, and they were a lot more expensive. The fact that this place is cheap, regularly yummy, good for late-night eats and friendly makes it really appealing."
"I went for my first time this evening and was thoroughly disappointed.  From the very beginning I thought the wait-staff treated our group in a disrespectful and condescending manner. We had to wait for a table and were told to go next door to the bar to hang out while we wait, but the door to the bar was locked.  They then thought we must be idiots because we couldn't open the door, when they realized that the bar ultimately WAS locked and they couldn't get in.  After this run-in, they told us that we should wait outside for a table because there was no room in the restaurant.  It's 30 degrees outside.  If you tell people they need to wait outside, you don't deserve anyone's business.  And so we left.  Thoroughly disappointed.  Thought the food looked good, but there are a billion other places in Chicago more deserving of business,"
"This was truly a serendipitous find! Walking along a beautiful Chicago Sunday morning for a cafe for breakfast, and we stumble upon the quaint Bite.  Fresh menu selection and all cooked deliciously with love.  The kicker...just out of the oven banana bread with some special butter.  Dinner is amazing too...there is an attached pub, so you can have a drink while you wait.  Dinner, dessert, cork fee, amazing service all add up to 5 stars.  Great place for a laid back breakfast, lunch, or dinner."
"Finally made it in here post-remodeling. What an improvement! The interior is bright, airy, clean and really cute - a wonderful change from the old Bite. The food is SO much better, too! I did halfsies with my husband, splitting the fried chicken sandwich and the cheeseburger, and I have to say that was the best meal I've had in a really long time. Plus, the waitstaff was super friendly, happily accommodating to our 9 month old and his stroller.  I'm a big fan of the new Bite!!"
"Kind of in love with this place right now. I typically like to mix it up when I go out to eat, but I keep coming back for more.Service is always good, and the atmosphere is very chill.Fantastic as a breakfast spot. Their breakfast poutine and pork hash are both phenomenal.Also great for dinner. Their specials have never let me down - their fried chicken is among the best I've had in the city, the skate is flavorful and perfectly seasoned, and the burger is exactly what it should be.Best thing I've had on the menu is the crispy pork shank. Can't recommend it highly enough."
"I can almost predict that my upcoming hangover this Saturday a.m. will result in a trip to Bite.   I am in need.   Scrambled eggs with a side of collard greens and my own personal bottle of Cholula.   My bloody mary will be deliciously peppered with two stalks of celery and four spiked olives.   If I'm deserving, I'll have potatoes too.   I love Bite's attitude towards Saturday mornings and I don't have to rush in or out - I can even sling a couple of balls at the pool table while I'm waiting for my home-cooked breakso.   The waitstaff deserve some love too, they have a tiny kitchen / workspace and a fairly demanding bunch of hungry jaws in their audience...if you're going here, you shouldn't expect starched aprons."
"My friend and I were in a rush. We really had about 45 minutes to order and eat. Yet we didn't inform anyone of that aspect because it seemed like a mostly casual eatery. We were seated quickly by the window.She ordered steak dish and I ordered a risotto. It's difficult for me to pass up risotto, especially when it includes some interesting root vegetables like rutabagas. I was surprised about the lack of alcohol options beyond Empty Bottle's offerings (and maybe BYOB). I passed on that. We both got our food in a timely manner and at the same time; everything was piping hot; and the flavor was good. The price for risotto was $8. The waitress was nice, but not as attentive as I would have liked after we received our food. Trying to get the check was harder than it should have been, as her eyes weren't on the small dining room for a while.I may consider returning, but I wouldn't go out of my way."
"I have now been to Bite Cafe twice, once before remodeling and once after the remodel.  The first time the food was great and service was awful, second time food was mediocre and service was awful.First time in this very small place, it was freezing outside.  My group and I opened the doors wrong, which there was a small poorly written sign explaining how to but we missed it.  In front of the 10 tables we were yelled at publicly for not doing this correctly.  We were so embarressed, and upset because everyone was looking at us.  The food was really good and thought we had great choices for brunch.  This past weekend I went again with 3 other people.  The menu was different and not necessarily what we had in mind.  We were very uncomfortable because the tables were so close together.  However, we were fine being tightly squeezed in.  Then a different server told someone at my table who was 6'5"" that they needed to move or move closer in because he was blocking their way.  Instead of moving the empty table or politely asking him to switch spots, she rudely told him he was in her way and he needed to move for the entire place to hear.  He was so uncomfortable and felt very unwelcomed.  The food was okay and overpriced for what we had.  First time was okay, and thought we would give this place another chance but now we will never go back.  Wish we could go back since I live"
"I give this place 3 stars just because both the food and service can be so hit or miss.  I would not recommend going here for dinner, as I've never had a good food experience here past 5pm.  I'm a vegetarian, although I'm by no means picky about how my fake meats taste.  But for some reason, getting tasty seitan or tofu from this place in dinner dishes can be difficult.  Their brunch menu is good, albeit somewhat lacking in variety and they don't seem to change it often (or at least haven't since summer from what I can tell).I would recommend this place if you're in the area, but wouldn't go out of my way to visit."
"The waiter gave us an IPA beer, for free. It was one of his own. We had brought our own wine, and finished it too quickly, and the waiter was concerned that we weren't drinking enough. He also let us sit at the ""cool kids table,"" and pick songs from his iPod to play in the restaurant. I guess being part of a table of five cute women has its perks at times. But I am jumping ahead here, -- While waiting to be seated at Bite, we hung out at the Empty Bottle and were collectively sat on by a sweet, mangy old cat, Radley. I like Radley, he's super old and super drooly. Our waiter at Bite named our table the ""Superwomen table,"" possibly because when we were waiting to be seated he got the golden opportunity to walk into the Empty Bottle and call out ""SUPERWOMEN!"" and we would all follow him into Bite. It was like we were just hanging out in the dude's house. Except there were chefs cookin, and we had to pay. When the bill came it was VERY low - very cheap food, and good food at that. We had the curried veggie wrap ($8ish), the chicken adobe, a fish special ($14) and the Thai green curry ($8ish). All of our selections were yummy without being extraordinary - it's solid, reliable comfort food without ostentation. Phew... really, i just wanted to write the word ostentation, and so i wrote this review. Now i feel much better."
"sigh...oh how i wanted to write a good review. i really really did. alas...went last night for dinner with my husband and a friend. i ordered the special. pan seared trout with broccoli rabe, radicchio and walnut vinaigrette. sounds delicious right?! sadly very very very not so. we ordered our food just before 8pm. it did not reach our table until a few minutes after 9pm. an hour wait for 3 dishes. my husband said his burger was meh...that the combo of the garlic aioli and the house mayo tasted a bit like toasted marshmallows in some bites. my trout itself was tasty enough though very under seasoned. everything else on the plate was completely inedible. there was not a single flavor profile but bitter. viciously bitter. i like bitter but there needs to be a contrast with a little acid , sweet or salty. this was purely bitter. also on my second bite of the fish i was jabbed in the lip by a mess of pin bones. ouch! when our server came to bring our check and clear the table my plate still had easily 3/4 of the food still on it. she did not ask if something was wrong with the dish. she did not ask if i had not enjoyed it. she did not even ask if i wanted the rest of the food boxed up. she just picked up the plates and dropped off the check. it was like she knew it was inedible and just didn't want to talk about it. this place is 1 block from my apartment. i really wanted to like it so i could have another spot close by for dinner. sad!eta - for the record i have been in the neighborhood for 10 years and went to the old bite quite a few time back then. didn't care for it much then either."
"Sometimes I dream about coming here...and its usually when I am out of town.Havent been for dinner.  Ever.  Weird since I live just down the street.  But going during breakfast/ lunchy time is just so darn good.  And yes, their menu comes in cute little hollowed out books (i normally end up with bible tales. coincidence? I hope so.   either that or the cosmos is kicking me to the curb...)  Yummy daily specials, amazing desserts, and their seitan chorizo makes me drool.  ooh, ooh...they have orange marmalade (plus other jams) served in mason jars! cutie pootie!  (owners may hunt me down and kill me for my unhipster-exclamation if they ever read this) May not be the most uptight tidy kinda place but man, those boys in the kitchen rock my casbah...make sure you give them a thumbs up on the way to the bathroom (located in the kitchen...okay, its kinda strange but homey in the same way)Sometimes I venture away from my seitan hash (plate full of sauteed veg, roasted pots,spicy seitan, and scrambled eggs- tofu is just as good as a substitute) and I order the veg burger...slathered in bbq and mushrooms (my choice) and served with papas rajas (potatoes with cheese and chiles aka heartattack causing orgasm)- oh, so good it makes my tummy sing! I told you, I dream about this place...in fact...I will be there tomorrow."
"I love the old book cover menus, the coffee is good, but the DESSERTS are what one should really come here for.  They are always outstanding, unique and very sweet tooth satisfying.  I have had poor service here before - a bit of rudeness from a waitress, but I will still come back (I think it was just an off day).  Sometimes, I like to sit in here later at night and drink coffee while i write in my diary.  They don't mind this."
"The first thing I noticed upon walking into this place was the smell...""what IS that?""  Not good.  It reminded me of a bad greasy spoon.The service was a little slow but very friendly and helpful.The food was OK...I had the chimichurri hangar steak.  Their version of medium-rare was a little too rare for my tastes, it's accompaniments fair...nothing special.  My friend, however, LOVED her ginger chicken.  So much so that, to my surprise, her skinny, L.A.-ass became a member of the clean-plate club.Judging by the actual menu selection and what our S.O.'s ordered I believe other reviewers of Bite to be correct in saying the specials board is where it's at.  I also appreciated that it's a BYOB joint...which normally  don't, but I can't imagine a place like this doing very well with a booze selection.Now, if I can just get this awful smell out of my clothes..."
"i love the new bite. i loved the old one too. though, they're almost completely different restaurants. so its hard to compare. yes, i miss some of the old dishes. but i'm also very excited about some of the new ones. three of us went the night they re-opened. we were seated immediately and greeted with a pleasant vibe (that was sometimes lacking before).also, super worthy of note is the fact that my clothes no longer smelled of food when i left the restaurant (possibly the best improvement in my opinion).the bucatini pasta, the baby beets, and the baked meatballs were all wonderful. the service was great. and the chef coming out to talk to each table and see how we were doing was a nice touch too - especially for opening night. i love the new look too. polished but not too fancy. the old artsy, eclectic look was wonderful too. but just in a different way. nice job bite. love your evolution. i'll be back soon."
"Bite is best for their amazing specials.  The regular menu items are also good, but the specials, they are amazing.  I have only been here for breakfast once, and it was delicious.  I can't stress enough the dinner specials, yum.  Staff is decently friendly, but they usually only have one waitress for dinner and it gets pretty busy, so you can understand staff being overwhelmed.  I have noticed that they don't seem to have very good ventilation.  When you walk in you can usually smell the food cooking, and when you leave you will probably smell like the special, just pray it isn't catfish."
"We come here fairly often when we're craving a good burger.  Then we end up ordering all sorts of other things because there is always something else that catches our eye and makes our tummies grumble.  The mussels and a bit of grilled bread are a standard.   Brunch of course is great, but it's usually crowded so we're more inclined to head in for an early dinner.  In this hood, the later you arrive, the busier it is, so prepare.  They do a great job in an ultra casual atmosphere."
"Sunday brunch around noon and the place was packed. We walked in they said it would be a few before any tables opened up but if we waited outside they would come and get us once a table is open. No big deal. Came out and said it might be a little longer, we can go wait at the Empty Bottle in the AC and get a few drinks if we like. We decided to just wait it out and maybe 5 min later we had a table. Didn't get a chance to try the specials on the chalk board, I wasnt feeling any of them that day. I seem to be on this breakfast burrito kick so I went with that. I really enjoyed it, everything about it was so good. The beans, the tortilla, even the sour cream on the side! Waitresses weren't that overly friendly to me and I'm fine with that. They took my order, served me my food and gave me my check without any prolonged wait. Works for me. I will be back for brunch again."
"At first was excited to see Bite was sprucing up, but then was worried about the menu changes. When I finally got back in there (couldn't get near it on a weekend morning) and took a look at their new menu, I was skeptical-none of my old faves were on there and I had a hard time getting excited about anything. My fiance & I decided to order the lentil appetizer while we peroused our menus. Finally, I decided on roasted garlic chicken, he the brisket sandwich. As per usual with Bite, once we received our meals we wanted to lick the plates clean. The lentil app was sooooooooooooo good! And the garlic chicken was so tasty despite being full I couldn't stop myself from continuing, Ughhhh...and the dessert-holey moley-the butterscotch pot de creme...whoah. One of the yummiest desserts ever I have tasted...even the coffee was great! Plus, it is STILL BYOB, thank God!!!I missed you Bite & I'm so happy you're back..."
"I, like many others, love bite after a night of drinking.  It is not the heavy breakfast I would get at a place like the Golden Nugget--which I like.  Their weekend brunch goes until 3pm, and is rarely overcrowded (as I've read from other reviewers).  The wait staff is one of my favorite aspects of Bite--I think they are very polite and accommodating.  If I had to complain, I would say the found can be a little bland for my tastes (that's what hot sauce is for).  However, it really is all about their specials.  Risotto pancakes with a white wine sauce, two eggs, and a house salad? Come on, are you really going to say no to that?"
"Any reviews stating that Bite is far from what it used to be are absolutely right. I just think it's better. Don't get me wrong, I dug the old bite - great food, friendly servers, cheap prices, BYO and 2 blocks from my house. I'd say my wife and I were regulars, but I'd be imposing.The new Bite Cafe's food is ridiculously good. We really like the upgraded kitchen and dining area... nothing too crazy, just  an upgrade people!The food!!! That chef Rodney Staton (Longman & Eagle, Spiaggia, Topolobampo) knows what he's doing!!!The Meatballs in tomato sauce were delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked - almost med rare inside. The size of the meatballs was perfect... not those gargantuan balls you get elsewhere. That marinara was so light and delcious, with just a sprinkling of fresh parm... and the bread was soft, yet grill-marked up... don't know how they achieve that.I had the chicken... and I have to say that it was probably the best chicken I've ever tasted in my life. It's a half an amish chicken, deboned except for the leg. Oh man was it just perfectly tender, juicy and succulent. And the crispiest skin I've ever tasted on chicken. It was served with about a head's worth of garlic, which pretty much scared me at first sight. But they were slow-cooked, confit-style - and we're incredibly sweet when I mashed them up with my fork. I'd scoop a bit of the mashed garlic with every bite of the chicken, then I'd run it through the most amazing sauce on the plate. Garlicky-sweet and rich, yet light and savory. Incredible.My wife had the salmon, which had some of the best salmon skin I've ever tasted. Served with hericot verts and leeks, in a mustard sauce at the bottom of the plate. Again, the sauce was an absolute star!The plating over everything was beautiful too! It's a bit 'pricier' than before - but damn-worth the $41, plus tip. There are three chalkboard specials every night - the salmon was one of them. When you start with a base of amazing sauces, you really can't go wrong when the quality of the ingredients is this good. We'll be back, often. Thanks Bite!!!"
"Aw. You're so cute with your little vintage book cover menus and I'm sure you hear it every day of your life but you still smile sheepishly and paw the dirt with the tip of your converse hightops. I stopped in for a bite @ bite before my friend's show at the Empty Bottle and had the veggie burger. I liked it okay - (nothing beats Austin, Texas' Mother's Cafe veg-burg but I digress)  but maybe I need to try another dish  . . . the point is I am willing to come back and try again because, gosh darn, you are so cute! My friend complained about your soy cappuchino so coffee drinkers beware . . . but our desserts were divine."
"Been on a brunch crawl as of late.  Bite was my latest.  Had the poutine.  Those who appreciate cheese would definitely take a liking to this.  I do and did.  Flavor was all there- not bland so I didn't need to seasoned it.  No wait and didn't felt the push to just eat and leave.  Yup, was able to enjoy a nice conversation without that aura."
Fried chicken sandwich was rad as well as the veggie muffaletta. Way to go guys! This place needed to be shook up a bit. Change is good!!
"The Classic is something I will probably eat a couple times a week for a while now. Potatoes are incredible, as are the eggs. I appreciate anybody that can scramble eggs perfectly. I like the changes, and will miss the old Bite, I am excited about the new Bite."
"There are some great breakfast and lunch options at Bite, local art displayed on the walls, fiftiesesque tables and menus and a generally cute vibe throughout.I particularly like the Bacon cornmeal pancakes and the nachos are amazing.  The veggie hash is rather uninteresting and the granola is a little sweet for my taste.This is a great place to have a quiet breakfast or coffee during the week but it does get busy on the weekends so you'll want to plan ahead.It can be a bit chilly inside."
"Very pleased with my brunch at Bite. I have been meaning to go here for two years and finally made it in. I had the corned beef hash which was real corned beef that they fry up in a pan with peppers and onions, it was delish. Good coffee, great service, and super cheap! At $10 a person, this is a great brunch spot. Can't wait to try the french toast."
"Take a lesson from me. Don't order falafel in a non-Mediterranean restaurant. It was okay, but not ""wow me"" good.You can get drinks from the Empty Bottle next door. But I just stuck with the coke in a can. But my friends were boozing it up.I went there on a Friday night for dinner and there wasn't a wait despite the place being small.I'll be back, but next time I'll stick with food representative of good old Americana. And by that I mean burgers."
"Quaint, cozy, cool. Came here for a quick 'bite', ha. Had a delectable grilled cheese and sweet potato fries dish- sweet and simple. Cheers to the chef, thank you for not over-salting the sweet potatoes, seems to be a big habit of most chicago dines. Don't over salt the sweet potatoes!Dig the 'current' paintings on the wall- some talent. Strawberry lemonade huh... interesting. Didn't try it, but I shall be back."
Pure fresh yumminess. Lovely staff. Awesome parking nearby!wish I could go more
"The service isn't always super friendly, but the food makes up for it. This was a great veggie option for my co-worker, and we would frequent here on our lunch breaks. I personally love their Buffalo Tofu - spicy with a really nice texture. It was enough for me to get it as my only thing for lunch. Very good, although I wish they had a Ranch sauce or something to go with it - the sauce they currently serve with it is just meh. My friend was in love with their veggie seitan tacos, with a texture that was nearing an actual meat product - and was fabulously seasoned.Overall, the food is good, decent portions, albeit a bit pricey."
"My dinner at Bite on Saturday night was great in every way. For a group of five, we probably waited about an hour, but there's a good beer list at Lock Down across the street, so we didn't suffer (despite Lock Down's.....interesting music).The interior of Bite Cafe, as others have noted, is quite small and nicely (read: not very) lit. It makes for a really cozy, pleasant atmosphere.Everything we ordered was wonderful. We started with the mussels, which were better than almost any I've had in the city. The smoky paprika/butter sauce required that we ask for extra bread to sop it up. We also tried the mac and cheese as an appetizer, which was solid, if not mind-blowing.The real star for me was the gnocchi I ordered for my entree. Holy cats. These gnocchi were like delicious potato pillows from heaven. I would order that every single time. I also sampled my friends' tofu with pumpkin quinoa, which was really well spiced and very good. If the gnocchi didn't exist, I'd order that. But it does.For dessert, the restaurant brought out a fudge brownie with hazelnut ice cream in honor of my friend's birthday. It's not the type of thing I'd have picked off a dessert menu, but, I tell you what, it wasn't a bad way to end a meal. At all.The service was casual but attentive. And they let us stick around to finish the cheap wine we had brought in (since, by that point, there were no other parties waiting to be seated).Go here. You won't regret it."
"Fantastic food and prices. Reminds me a bit of Longman and Eagle. BYOB!!! I tried the pork shank, pork shank hash, and Parisian Gnochi. All 3 were phenomenal. I have no idea why average review is not at least 4 stars."
"I went for the first time earlier today, and don't know why I didn't go earlier since it's in the 'hood.It's really inexpensive! Here, a breakfast sandwich is $6.50. At other similar places, it's $8. Price notwithstanding, the quality was quite good. Their dessert menu looked really really tantalizing, but willpower prevailed. This time. Dessert with breakfast seems a bit excessive anyway.The waitress was somewhat inattentive (-1 star), but we weren't hustled out the door when we chose to sit and chat for a while (+1 star). Lauren W's comment about ventilation seems spot-on. After a while of sitting in there, I noticed that I could both smell and -see- some overcooked potatoes wafting in the air (in smoke form -- it'd be +3 stars if there were flying potatoes).Jesus christ, people, please read the sign on the door about not holding both doors open at once. The cold blasts were pretty bad-styles, but this was actively not Bite's fault. Only 3 stars since I've been there but once and it wasn't perfect. I may edit this after further tastings."
"The food is ok, but my clothes always smell really horrible after being here, so bad I have to wash them as the smell lingers for days."
"I love this place.Great pick on a night when you want to go out, bring a bottle of wine or six pack and get a solid - and sometimes surprisingly inventive - meal without feeling bad when you get the check.I've been to Bite a few dozen times, and I've only once had a dish I didn't like (tilapia with lemongrass and coconut milk cooked in foil packets - a rare miss).  The veggie and fish dishes are typically great.  The fish tacos are especially great, and every night they supplement the regular menu with three or four alluring specials.  If you're a dessert person, they've got you covered with four or five dessert specials every day.Also, I want to give a shout out to the waitstaff.  They're always super friendly and (dare I say it?) professional, even when the place is busy.  Thanks."
"First off, liked the atmosphere here, laid back. Cool design- decor,lighting etc.. The kind of place that's enjoyable just to be there. Some might consider it a bit cramped, but when we were there it wasn't  totally filled, so it didn't feel that way. Personally, I think cramped can become cozy depending on the atmosphere.Second, I brought the kids with and they didn't roll their eyes and treat us like outcasts (get a star just for that), There was also another group with a kid- but no one seemed bothered.Had the breakfast food. The omelet was good (but not extraordinary).I could tell the spinach & mushrooms inside were fresh, and feta is always good.The only part that I wasn't crazy about, I felt it was a bit overcooked, but I don't want to get picky now.The cornbread french toast must have been something special since my son (who is a finicky eater) really liked it. I tasted the blueberries on top and it was good , they didn't taste like some corn-syrup something from IHOP. The cinnamon butter was a nice treat as well.The service was good, they were helpful and accommodating.I definitely want to come back and try the place for dinner."
"One of the best places around for making omnivore to vegan and everything inbetween full and happy.This place kicks the shit out of the Chicago Diner, as far as I'm concerned.  Everything I've had has been amazing.  Typically when you order ""ethnic"" cuisine at an American style restaurant, the flavors are off and the end result falls short.  My Japanese plate was beyond excellence!  My favorite thing about the place (besides byob!) is the look of gratitude your omnivorous friends will have gnawing on some BBQ, thankful that they have been spared another bland tofu nightmare in their attempt to be veg-sensitive!"
"Knocking them down one star after the rehab/menu change. Their new menu is not as good but I do like the ""Mashbrowns""Bring back the old menu with the mashbrowns!!"
"After reading a few reviews of my favortie breakfest place I figured I better post one.First off I am not  a hipster. I usually roll in on a weekday morning straight out of bed. unkept and in dire need of coffee. Dan is usually my amazing morning server. The music is usually low and rocking and if i beg enough sometimes he puts on Slayer for me!I do admit I am usually one of those pain in the ass breakfest eaters i.e no this extra that can I subisitute this. Yes I have even sent Dan back into the kitchen to see if I can get a bowl of soup at 9am on a tuesday morning when its 95 degrees out. I have never had eyes rolled, attitude or anything but great customer service from him.If you are a newbie to bite I recommend ordering of the specials board . Ive eaten some truly amazing things that I wish would end up on their daily menu . (hint hint veggie trio lunch with mashed sweet potatoes bbq seitan and summer slaw)My coffee cup never goes below half full and I always leave stuffed."
"I have eaten here probably 3 or 4 times and every time the food is always good. I have gotten various omlettes and coffee, but was completely blown away by their open face pulled pork sandwich. Served on corncakes it is to die for. I day dream about it sometimes and long for the day that I will get the excuse to go back.As far as the service goes I have been completely satisfied every time. The waitstaff is usually jokingly surly in a charming way, they are always really friendly and not condescending. So thumbs up, gang!"
"I used to frequent this place b/c its close and cheap.  The desserts are outstanding and the food is ok.  The service was, shall we say, laid back.  Then I looked up.  EW!  Filthy up top.  Disgusting.  Then I was looking in the kitchen, which is also where the bathroom is.  Oh boy.  He dropped the knife, picked it up, and kept on slicing.  Game over."
"Really, Bite needs a new name, because it's a new restaurant, and I love it. If you're mad about losing the old Bite, I don't mean this in a condescending way, but it's time to grow up.  The few things I tried were honestly incredible.  I went on a Monday for dinner so there was no wait, ordered the special, and was so happy that our neighborhood finally has an amazing restaurant! It's like a smaller/cheaper (BYOB)/more vegetarian-optioned L&E."
"Oh, I remember when I used to live next door to Bite.  What a wonderful place to eat.  GET THE GRILLED CHEESE!  The food is great, atmosphere is as expected, and service is respectable.  Go now!"
Been for dinner and brunch. Everything is fresh and well prepared. Prices are reasonable.  Great place.
"having been going here for at least four years now and have always founds the food reasonable but sometimes hit or miss.  With the renovations and new chef on board, this place has really impressed me.  It's a smaller menu but it seems more focused.  Good options and everything seems to be made with more care and attention.  Great new space with a fabulous counter area and a real bathroom.  It was a staple before but now its a great place for serious quality meals."
"As a testament to how good Bite is, we took a hot, 45 minute bus ride, at 9am, while supremely hungover, just to eat here.Totally worth it. We all just sat there, silently eating and smiling at how satisfying it was (which, looking back, was probably quite a creepy sight for our fellow diners). The chorizo seitan is awesome, especially since 1.) most not-totally-veg places don't offer seitan and 2.) most not-totally-veg places that do often don't know how to cook it. Bite does. I got it in the breakfast burrito, which was so filling that I took half home. For $7, with potatoes, not too shabby. The watermelon lemonade was a bit bitter for my tastes, I would have preferred a bloody mary but I was a little confused by how the liquor worked. Like, could I order it from next door and have it served to my table? Or do I have to eat then go to Empty Bottle? Things that all could have been solved by asking, no doubt, but see the aforementioned hangover.All in all, it was awesome. Everyone I was with was also totally satisfied. And if it tastes that good when the only thing I want to do is crawl in a hole and die from irresponsible alcohol consumption, I can't imagine how good it would be if I had all my wits about me.Favorite thing besides the food? The fact that the waitress had my order on our bill as ""Satan Chorizo"". Whether it was a spelling error or me signing off in agreement that I sold my soul for that deliciousness, I don't know and don't care."
"We came here before a show at the Empty Bottle.  Thank you, Yelp, for once again helping me navigate an area I'm not that famililar with.First off, the place is small but friendly.  I don't want to know what this place is like during brunch.  Even though it was pretty packed, it wasn't loud or uncomfortable.The boy had the veggie burrito, which he said was pretty bland, but the salsa on the side was awesome.  I had a burger since I was being indecisive, but I got it with goat cheese.  I love goat cheese and I've never had it on a burger.  I have to say I was pleasantly surprised.  It was a nice combination, even though I would have liked my burger cooked for a teeny bit more (I ordered it medium-well and it was pink all the way through).Overall, will we be coming back?  Probably not, unless we're going to the Empty Bottle."
"Bite is the kind of no-frills place where you can get accosted by your holier-than-thou waiter for not being no-frills enough yourself.  I try not to let service get in the way of good food, but I always seem to have this problem with the waitstaff at Bite.  I can't figure out if I am too cool or not cool enough.  Anyhow, the food though makes up for every whining, tattooed, tight pant wearing server at this BYOB, hole-in-the wall.  The kitchen is about the size of my bathroom, while the bathroom is about the size of my shower. That need not worry you though, because you go to a restaurant to eat, not to poop and pee. I love the apps and the ever-changing specials written on the chalkboard. The fries are great and I love fries!  The burger is good as well as the falafel platter.  We used to get these chicken wings every time we went, but have not seen them in quite some time.  The best part was the pickled cucumber.    Next time you go - and this is what may set the waitstaff off about me - bring a blender, tequila, limes, salt and request an abundant amount of ice.  Ask your server for an outlet and start making your own frozen margaritas at your table.  This is what I always do at BYOB's.  After all, doesn't BYOB stand for bring your own blender?"
"I've only eaten here once; the food was eclectic, fresh and tasty. I avoided all the ethnic sounding dishes as I tend to do at nonethnic restaurants. The special I ordered was delicious. Bite is small and has a diner feel.  Layer up in the winter as it's a bit chilly inside. The service was just ok. This is a good option if you want a quick bite before seeing a show at the Empty Bottle."
Delicious fucking food. I ordered the fried chicken sandwich.Fantastic service. The only qualm I had was an enormous piece of human shit sitting on the sidewalk outside of the restaurant. I know it wasn't their fault-- but someone needed to clean that up. haha. Ew!
"We did have to seat ourselves and wait five minutes before they acknowledged us but they were quick to refill our coffees and the food was fancy and not your usual breakfast. I had a bagel sandwich with fresh salmon, capers, cream cheese and pickled onions. It wasn't my favorite combination of flavors so I probably wouldn't get it again but it was still pretty good and I was happy just to order it. I'll definitely go back to Bite."
"i have no familiarity with the ""old"" bite, first off, so i have no basis of comparison. i do really like the blue chairs, sleek tile, and overall minimalist yuppie ""diner"" look of it, but maybe that's just me. i ordered a vegetarian pasta that was really only so-so, nothing i couldn't make myself at home. most of the vegetarian options just kind of seemed like something i'd cook on my own. call me picky, but if i'm spending the money to eat out, i expect a little something ""extra."" i do like that it's byob, and there was a $15 wine bottle special next door at the empty bottle. that was honestly the best part of the meal."
"Hispter feeling... I don't think so. More of just a great place for breakfast / brunch. Nothing about this place makes me feel like they are trying for a look. This is just what they are and if you don't want to come in, then stay at home. This spot isn't a place for all the people looking for the next greatest brunch place. When I went I didn't have to wait in line at all, which is why I have avoided places like Milk & Honey and Lulu Cafe.Overall the brunch was great and service was excellent. I wasn't too happy about spending $3 for a donut , but it was good.  They don't have a huge menu which is perfect.. the last thing I want is too many choices for how I want my eggs."
"So yeah, this is a bit of a ""hipster"" place.  It's also BYOB and has good food.  That is enough for me.  I haven't had the problems with servers like other people.  It has been, at times, quite busy and that has slowed down the servers some, but not enough for me to get upset.  I've only been here for brunch and Bite has plenty of veggie options, which always makes it hard to choose what to order.  I do recommend their omelets, as that's always a good choice."
"house salad w/ aleppo pepper vinaigrette + seitan, tomato bean soup, and apple crisp -- all delicious & all vegan. i feel it an obligation to hi-lite the aleppo pepper salad dressing which is highly addictive. Pros: plentiful vegan options, affordable pricing, delicious food, hipster hangout. Cons: mediocre service, i smelled like a hipster walking out of this place."
"This place makes me into such a fat kid. I had forgotten that until last night when I proceeded to order Nachos, A BBQ Sandwich, Potatos and cheese,2 kinds of cake, and three drinks. I don't know how anyone can complain about the service. Everytime i come here I get the same exact same waitress and she is always super sweet, and even brings out the free coffee, and doesn't judge when I order several cake snacks. The absolute only downside is the wacky doors when you walk in that create a vaccum and make you look like an idiot. Otherwise, total cake eatting magic!"
"Food:  always amazing, hands down.  I stuff myself here.  In fact, I always order dessert here, because it's so good.  And I'm not a dessert orderer.Staff:  ridiculously rude.  There is one waitress that I haven't seen for a while that I really like.  The rest need some help.  Case in point?  Waitress walks up to our table, asks, ""Is anybody interested in dessert?""  We five reply, ""Yes.""  At which point she turns and walks away, never to return.  Waitress and her fellow waiter are clearly eyeing our table of five, trying to turn it over quickly, so we sense some urgency in the air.  My dad motions to the waiter so we can order our dessert and get out of their hair.  Waiter makes a ridiculously passive aggressive comment about ""next time, just yanking his leash.""  Wow.  And woah.  We just want to order dessert, friend.  Then we'll eat dessert, and we'll leave.  We won' t linger, we promise.So be warned of that aspect to your dining experience, should you choose to eat here.  If you can deal with it, and perhaps dish out a bit of attitude in return, then you will at least have a very good meal-- breakfast or dinner.  You just might be all tense and want to punch your waiter in the face (that's a hypothetical, in my case; yoga teachers aren't supposed to punch people)."
"I just ate at Bite after walking over with a few friends on a Friday night.  The servers were great (so good my friend found the manager to give pass on a compliment) and the food was good.  I really loved my special (hangar steak with beans, jicama, plantains and a salsa) and my friends thought their falafel was decent, although it looked like it was in a tortilla rather than a pita.  The bf got pork tacos, which were chunky pork with too much fat... I think he was expecting pulled pork, which he is crazy for... so the extra bits of gross fat were not what he wanted.  One of our party got dessert... something, something amaretto cheesecake... whoa! it was super (we all had to have a bite).  I would head there again for dinner and probably get another special... I think those are what they seem to focus on most and I have had winning specials in the past.  I like breakfast there too."
"So, I came back here after not having dined here for several months.  It was pretty darn good last time, too.  Well, this time Bite cafe kind of ""bit.""  The couple next to us were clearly on their first date, and the tables are pretty close together.  It took all my concentration to not listen to the girl who was very nervous and talking very quickly about her grandparents who were sooooo interesting.  Now I know 1st dates can be weird, so I get the awkwardness.  I couldn't help but feel bad for this girl, wishing I could somehow reassure her, and let her know  that she did not have to try to prove herself so much.  Well, back to my food.   We started with a salad to share.  There was no vinegar  and very little flavor in the vinaigrette, but it did contain lime juice from a bottle, with that familiar bottled lime juice taste. I ordered the short rib stroganoff, which again, had very little flavor, no wine, and what seemed to be rehydrated mushrooms with a terrible texture.  I think they may have lost a chef, or had someone filling in.  So that's my review."
"I've been to Bite three times. Each time I go I promise myself I will never go again.The food is not particularly special. I think that you could get the same kind of ""kitchy/fusion/veggie-friendly"" food at better places, like Earwax or the Pick Me Up. If you have a choice, go to those places, you will be much more satisfied.I have been to Bite for Breakfast, lunch and dinner.For Breakfast, I had the pancakes. Pretty hard to screw up, right?They were more like crepes. Which isn't a bad thing, but if I knew that I wouldn't have put anything on them and eaten them with just the powdered sugar they put on them. They were oddly lemon-esque and not in a good way.My friend had the breakfast burrito. It was filled with giant pieces of potato. They were hotter than the rest of the burrito and were not seasoned very well. It was inedible.For Lunch, I got the nachos, which are an appetizer. I could have made better at home. Do not bother to get these, they are just not worth it. My friend got their macaroni and cheese. It was bland and she had to cover it in Tobasco in order to eat most of it. For dinner, I got an unremarkable burger. Again, I could have made better at home. It was so boring I don't even remember anything about it.These are the basics. If you can't make the basics taste great, then it's not worth it to me to try the specials!As for the waitstaff, they seem to be apathetic at best.Today when we walked in, we were immediately told to ""shut the door, it's cold out."" Obviously it was. It's very rude to speak to someone like that when they first walk in. It's not like we were attempting to make the place more uncomfortable by walking in. Skip Bite...just skip it."
"Bite is cute.  Bite has good food.  There is no way you are ever getting out of Bite without smelling like you worked an 8 hour shift in a kitchen.  One day I smelled the familiar stench I'd grown accustomed to when I worked in food service in my house.  On my boyfriend.  I asked if he had eaten at Bite, and he had, for lunch.  Seriously, hours later, you will have the linger of Bite on you.I wonder if you can get food to go?"
Great food. The new chef has come up with some great seasonal menus since his arrival.  Inventive and delicious while avoiding gimmicky combinations and preciousness. Great service.    Comfortable atmosphere.  A winner.
"The place itself is very cute and there are lots of bits of flair all around (like those cute little vintage book menues). Positives:   The staff was friendly, the prices aren't too high, it's byob, and there are a fair amount of veg. friendly optionsNegative:The food itself was only SO-SO.  Really nothing special at all.  The lentil mushroom soup tasted a little too much like fungus or earth.  My friends pasta with chunks of tomato and sauce was oddly similar to Spaghettios!! I'd probably go again because they have a lot to offer in terms of atmosphere and location (not too many options in that neighborhood) but definitely not for the food alone."
"I ADORE BITE!! Being a semi-picky vegetarian, they have a variety of eats and treats to satisfy my veggie needs. I normally don't crave a veggie burger, but theres are the best!  They always have an interesting plate of the day, and their desserts are to die for! The options of side dishes are excellent, and the wait staff is usually very helpful in finding something delicious for your to eat. The young lady with glasses always has a good perspective on what to order and is very polite. The pricing is very reasonable, and the  decor is low-key, but interesting none the less. Only issue I have with Bite - the wait time for food is something very long. They have a waiter there who is hot-and-cold...sometimes super kind and talkative, other times short and somewhat rude. We all have our off days, and working in the service industry can be draining. Understandable.Overall, I give Bite 5 stars! I would give 4.5, but I have no idea how to do that. If you want to teach me how, go for it!"
"Dear Bite,Oh how I miss your glorious nachos.  I miss living around the corner from you and order your nachos at least once a week.  You turned me into a person who could actually enjoy guacamole.Signed,Your missed friend."
"Great food, quirky atmosphere, awesome vegetarian selection, BREAKFAST TACOS!!Highly recommend this place for weekend brunch or for dinner.  It is quite small so I imagine it can have a wait during peak hours, but Ive always come during non-peak and never had to wait. One of the best places to eat in the neighborhood."
"So of course we had to go back after a two-month dry spell from Bite (closed to make the New Bite). We went for dinner and it is a much nicer looking place that hardly resembles the Old Bite. Anyway, the food is still really good, albeit more expensive ($2-$3 more an entree) and more interesting. As stated by others, they are using more organic stuff so it follows that it'd cost more. Get the garlic chicken - holy sh-t that was good. And the butterscotch dessert almost sent me to...well, you get the picture. Still damn good, but just not the same place....."
"Love the new and improved Bite!!  I live around the corner and couldn't be happier to have such a delicious brunch only steps away.  I am so happy that they revamped this place and the new menu is wonderful.  Great prices, good service, and we rarely have to wait.  Best bloody marys in the world!!"
"i've been to bite twice and really enjoyed the place both times.  the menu has a wide range of options with culinary influences from around the world.  the menu changes from time to time (maybe seasonal?), so that's good too - keeps it from getting boring or predictable.  items i've had and enjoyed thoroughly are the buffalo tofu appetizer, the tofu adobo w/ coconut milk, fried spinach (was a little cautious of that, but it was DELICIOUS) and onion rings, and the green curry.  everything was super good.the servers are a tad too hip for me (read: attitude) but are for the most part friendly and efficient.  the place is small. BYOB."
"You know what is abso-fucking-lutely fascinating?! Just try and guess!No, not the buoyancy of Kim Kardashian's ginormous ass.No, no certainly not those abhorrent White House Thanksgiving crashers. Slow fucking news day or what?And NO, it's definitely not wondering what the point is of ""thong sized"" panty liners. Ick.I'll just go ahead and tell you what it is, shall I?The Evolution of the Bloody Mary!  Bloody fascinating, I tell you!What was once a rather foul concoction involving shitty canned tomato juice from concentrate, Skol, a swizzle stick and a plastic cup (usually served up by a simpering airline hostess named Tammy) has now blossomed into a full pint of epicurean glory. If I'm being fair, it's not really Bite's Bloody Mary but rather the Empty Bottle's next door. The combination of Guinness, tomato juice, olive brine, some kind of delicious sediment, vodka and dijon mustard (yes) might sound like some kind of sick dare but it really must be tasted to be believed. Definitely worth the trip next door. But you'll need an extra pair of hands to help carry your beer-backs - no worries, the staff will happily oblige. Food and service is worth some praise as well. My cornmeal and bacon griddle cakes with homemade chunky applesauce and achiote cinnamon butter were just the ticket. In writing this review, I just realized that I have leftovers! Pause!Aaaaaand resume! So the service here has always been very good. Friendly and efficient. If you order coffee, not only are you never going to see the bottom of your cup...I defy you to try and get more than two sips out of your mug before it's topped off.  Also I have quite the soft spot for waitresses you call you ""hon"". Waiters, not so much. But I'd rather ""hon"" than ""ma'am.""I haven't told you about my favorite part of my last visit to Bite! At the moment there is an exhibition of paintings made by an individual in the Arts of Life Program. According to artsoflife.org ""Arts of Life is an artistic community that provides adults with developmental disabilities an environment to experience personal growth."" The paintings that are up at the moment are mostly of American Presidents but I'm sure you'll find them great conversation pieces. I especially love the one of Thomas Jefferson. Check 'er out!"
"Such a cool place. Hip vibe, delicious food, BYO. It's cool how you have to walk through the kitchen to get to the bathroom; Maggie the pastry chef gabbed with me while I waited for my turn. What a friendly crew!"
"Outstanding.  Had the salmon special, cooked perfectly over chickpeas.  My pal had trout with bacon.  Amazing.  Another pal had a pulled pork sandwich, which was lovely.  We all shared chocolate mint sorbet for dessert.  Wonderful food, nice people.  Great place!"
"It's BYOB, it's small, it's tasty, it's mellow, it's cute, it's cheap, it's a good place to go. Great coffee at breakfast, good specials at dinner. Go with friends, bring your favorite drinks, and relax."
"You might miss the place if you're walking by too fast. 'Happened to be in the neighborhood a few weeks ago early one Saturday morning, and happened to walk by and would have never noticed the place except their light blue chairs  caught my eye, and then i noticed a number of very happy people sitting at the tables.  My gf and I were hungry, and said why not.  Oh my! yum, yum yum.  We are coming back (from the very northside of Chicago) because we could not possibly eat all the things we wanted to try.  I'll keep it brief and just say that the Breakfast Poutine is heavenly!  Coming from Quebec, I did not know if they'd have a clue what a Poutine is - look it up.  This one was outstanding.  Everything was delicious. Yum!"
"I was one of the people in Doug P.'s group during the experience he referenced in his review and, like him, I was determined to never return. However, one of my friends suggested meeting here the other night so I figured I'd give Bite another shot, and I must say, the experience was much improved from the last time I had attempted to patronize this establishment. So much so, in fact, that I decided it deserved a more positive Yelp review.I feel it's necessary to mention that this time around we came in later on a weeknight so the place was near empty, which was a big difference from the last time. However, this time the hostess/waitress was very polite and courteous. She greeted us right when we walked in and was very polite and attentive for the duration of our meal.Since I was actually able to try the food this time I can say that the eggplant/goat cheese appetizer was especially delicious, and the Mediterranean chicken sandwich I had as a main course was not too shabby either.In conclusion, I'm guessing this place is hit or miss. While the food is good... the quality of service, judging from the other reviews and my own experience, greatly depends on what time of day it is, how busy the restaurant is, which server you happen to get etc...I will, however, come back again."
"My food (and the food of my friends, tastes of which I snuck) was awesome. Yes, awesome. I got a veggie scrambler type thing with potatoes, but next time I might get their special fancy crazy french toast blueberry muffin banana thing - a friend had it and it was amazing. The prices were very reasonable as were the portions. The woman working at the bar making the bloody marys was real real mean, but maybe she was having a bad day, so I let it slide. The waitress on the other hand was very nice and good with keeping the coffees full and hot.I can't think of a real reason to give it 4 stars instead of 5, but I didn't have that ""wow oh man this place is the best number one"" feeling, so I can't in good conscious bump up the rating. Yet."
"Why is this place only 3.5 stars?  It's one of my favorite places.  In fact, we take all our out of town guests here.  And it's BYOB!"
"I hate restaurants that spend so much time being kitschy and cute that the food seriously suffers. But Bite, the caf attached to the Empty Bottle, one of the best music venues in the city, has amazing food and a ton of character.No matter if I'm stopping in for brunch or dinner, there's always some inventive specialty of the day scribbled on the chalkboard. I love that even though the basic menu changes every few months, I can always find something to eat. In fact, everyone I know can find something to eat here, whether they're a hardcore vegetarian (such as myself) or the most devoted flesh eater. Even a basic veggie burger here takes on new life with a side of delicious mashed sweet potatoes and yummy toppings you can add for $.75 each. But what I really love about Bite is that it's remained practically unchanged for the past five years. I love that the staff is friendly, but not sugary sweet and fake. I love that it's still sort of an artsy, neighborhood spot. The menus are constantly falling apart, if the staff plays music it's always random, funny and maybe even a bit ironic AND you can BYOB or use that nifty little connecting door and get drinks from the bar at the Empty Bottle. The only thing that could make Bite better is if they started serving all the delicious sandwiches and veggie chili from Leo's (r.i.p.). Oh, and in case you didn't know, I believe the same lady who started Leo's and Bite is also behind Feed, which I've also only heard good things about. The bottom line is that I can live without fancy Italian furniture or kitschy 70s dcor and tang martinis (ahem, Kitsch'n), so long as the food speaks for itself, and at Bite, the food definitely speaks my language."
I just don't get how this place stays in business. Eek indeed.
I went here for the first time on Saturday night for a late dinner. I had the veggie burrito which was really good however the rice was either under cooked or over cooked. In other words it was crunchy. That pretty much ruined it. My friend had the green curry. Again really good (warning EXTREMELY spicy) but the crunchy rice made it much less enjoyable. The service was good but wow did it smell like grease in there! We were completely smelly by the time we left and continued to be stinky all night. Next time I'll get something without rice and bring some perfume.
"Bite is a nice little cafe in the neighborhood. It's the kind of place where everyone in your party can find something to eat. I usually get a burger, my H can get a pasta. They don't rush you through your meal, yet things don't take forever. However, make sure you don't open both doors when it's cold! We broke the airlock and got a slight scolding. But it was all good...I'd recommend Bite for a nice little meal."
"If you don't like the food here then you don't like food.  Breakfast is on the ordinary but solid side for me but it's dinner than makes my stomach growl when I think of it.  You must order from the specials board, everything is good.  If you want to guarantee ""great"" then ask your server for their recommendation.  They're always honest.  Don't forget it's BYOB... but if you do, you can head over to the Empty Bottle through the interior pass-through and go grab a bottle of wine/sixer of beer/mixed drink.  You might even catch a glimpse of whoever is performing that night.  No corkage fee although I recommend bringing a corkscrew with you as theirs have a tendency to disappear.  Even when they do have them, they're usually not of the highest quality.  If you want to be nosy and see what's up in the kitchen, just fake a full bladder and mosey through on your way to the WC.  Lovely and clean!Finish your night off with one of the deserts, they're always drool-worthy."
Industrial chic decor and friendly waitstaff gain points here.  Food was yummy if even decadent.  Problem:  incredibly greasy.  Heartburn inducing greasy.  Take one bite and you're done.  It will be tasty...
"I've been here for brunch (only) a few times.  It's got some good vegetarian selections, frequent alternating specials, and all the food seems very fresh.  It's not exactly gourmet, but its pretty solid food.  If you want the booze - which I always do - you need to get it at the bar next door (there's a doorway in the rest so you don't need to go outside).The bathroom is in the back of the kitchen, which I don't mind, but kinda creeped a friend of mine out.  It's a bit of a hipster d-bag spot, but I would recommend it if you're looking for a brunch alternative."
"Bite always treats me so goooood!Excellent coffee, fresh ingredients, unique daily specials, and great service keeps me coming back for more. My only issue is that I live no where near this joint. No worries though, I manage to make it out here at least once a month---grreeeeeat!"
"Just experienced Bite since the remodel and love it.  I had the fried chicken leg sandwich and got the mash potatoes instead of fries, both were fantastic!  I love the new decor and the staff were great.  Will definitely return."
"I think that I am not enough of a hipster to really love this place.  Or maybe I am just too old.  I haven't been to a show at the Empty Bottle since 2003.  Eh.I hate the set-up.  I sat at the table next to the employee table and could see way too much of the kitchen.  I don't like that feature in upsale, nicely styled restaurants and I REALLY don't like it in this place.  The table was too small and there was too much crap on it to fit two dishes and two drinks.  Our waiter was fine.  The music was fine.  It was all pretty bland to me.  I also don't like waiting in the pool room at the EB for a table.  I reduse to sit on that nasty old couch and there really is nowhere else to sit while waiting in there.The food was good but not too exciting.  I was a vegetarian for 7 years and have had some pretty kick-ass meatless food.  This wasn't it.  I got the falafel which was..well...falafel.  Nothing different or special about it.  It wasn't too greasy which I appreciate but I also prefer to have a traditional sauce with it instead of mushy, overcooked, flavorless vegetables.  The pita was soggy which is kind of gross.I would not go here again unless I was in the area and, frankly, this area isn't what it once was (then again, I'm not the person I once was).  So really there's no draw for me."
"I've been a brunch regular here for about a year. It's a solid, yummy brunch. Last night I tried dinner there for the first time. LOVED IT! I had the Cassoulet. Delicious! A delicious bean/pork/sausage/duck stew. And super cheap ($13?!?). I never get dessert but we tried the Gingerbread cheesecake. So good. Everything was so delicious I almost cried."
"Bite changed hands, this review is no longer relevant, I have not been to the new Bite so I am not amending my rating for the sake of neutrality. Sorry, New Bite."
"Made it in for brunch and it was lovely. It wasn't too crowded, they still had really interesting food combos, and we had great service. I had the special which were eggs benedict with spinach and red pepper cream sauce. The eggs weren't as fluffy as I've had some poached eggs, and the potatoes were nothing to write home about, but good flavors and down-to-earth atmosphere."
"What the heck took me so long to go back?  I heard they remodled and assumed that meant worse food/higher prices.  I am such an ass!  just came back from one of the best meals of my life.  Started with Asparagus/Ricotta (OMG), then Salmon with a side of ""smashed potatoes"", finish with a brownie w/ pretzel ice cream, then a bill for 2 that was $50?  What was I waiting for?  I am stuffed and now may start stalking them asking for a large takeout bag of the potatoes.  Diana is a great server, and LOVES their food, so ask her what's the best thing on the menu, order it, smile and then give her a good tip.  I can't wait to go back.....may have to diet a little, but worth it!"
"The Look - - - The room was packed both times (ones brunch and one dinner) but the wait for brunch was short (15 mins) and the wait for dinner longer (maybe 30 mins)- but we went over to the bottle and had some cocktails - ($5 dollar kettle soda by the way!!!! - bonus) and a server came over to the bar to get us when the table was ready.  The space is small and the physical renovations are a subtle but significant improvement.  I really like the addition of the bar with the stationary stools, the new windows, the matching wood tables and I love love love the pop of color from the blue chairs.  Clearly - the bathroom is much improved - and I am no longer afraid to go in there.  The new ""art"" is boring, hung and matted poorly, and seems incongruous with the rest of the décor.  Before the renovations - I found myself just trying to ignore the look of the torn booths, the nasty bathroom, the floor with holes, and the general film of grease that seemed everywhere - b/c I wanted my Eggs Bite!  Some called it ""character"" I called it dirty.The Service -  - - - much improved.  While I never had ""terrible"" service before, I have often come to Bite and saw servers sitting in the corner booth and reading or using their phone.  Alternatively - on other occasions - I could not find my server at all for long stretches of time and would have to get up at retrieve the odd item myself - hot sauce, napkin - etc.  Many of the old front of the house staff are still there - as far as I can see - and new people have been added.  Service now seems more upbeat and streamlined. The staff appears excited to be there. There were some flubs like not getting spoons at brunch for coffee or getting presented with brunch menus when there for dinner - but nothing major and everything immediately corrected because the service is much more attentive.  BYO service is good - whites and beers were put in the fridge and iced (need buckets for the tables) and bottles were opened and poured for us.  The Food - - - - I know that there has been some controversy - see some of the other recent reviews - and don't get me wrong I miss my eggs bite - but the new menu just is not to be compared to the old one.  The focus is different (was veggie tex-mex-ish with no focus - now more ""American classic"")  and - the quality of the ingredients is different (before somewhat generic (with the exception of the desserts) - now you can tell they are using higher quality ingredients and better product).   The new menu is more limited, but tighter and more balanced.  There are still different specials each day - and I was happy to see that.For brunch - the ""bruscetta"" with the mushrooms and leeks and strong sourdough was very flavorful.  The poutine was too much for me - but others disagreed and loved it - and I did find myself repeatedly dipping my toast into the bacon gravy. The homemade biscuit was super fluffy inside and fresh and the French toast has its own twist with the sea salt whipped creme that made my morning.  The coffee was very good - strong like I like it - but my companion wanted a latte and they only serve drip . Finally - those mashed browns  - go get them - order two - they are the stuff that makes a brunch special and on the day I was there they sold out ( we were able to get one for the table)! I also went for dinner and I am still thinking about the homemade ricotta appetizer - the hint of citrus and chili really makes it a standout for me.  The fried chicken leg sandwich is addictive - its huge - and I didn't think I would be physically able to eat the whole thing - but then - I did - I couldn't help myself.  The fries however left something to be desired.  The pasta dish with the pesto was bland and muddled if well portioned.  We shared the veggie/vegan special of grilled romaine w/ cauliflower and chickpea - and it was above average and creative.  The  1/2 chicken was the table favorite it was perfectly seasoned - the skin crispy the meat juicy ...going back for that.I've been in the neighborhood since 2001 and I have been eating at Bite since then and I will continue to go there.  I have never yelped before- I check it all the time for opinions and ratings -  but I wanted to start now with Bite because the some of the recent low ratings below seemed based mostly on what those yelpers miss (i.e. low rating because bite is not the same place it was) and not what the new bite has to offer now and I think thats biased - but understandable - basically this is a new restaurant not simply a renovated one- Bite has been around for over 10 years - I think the change was needed and has been well executed and shows that the restaurant is not afraid of change and - in my opinion - it improved."
"Food is pretentious at best; fitting for the uber-hipster clientele who frequent this small, crowded restaurant.  I really tried liking this place.  I went there numerous times when I first moved in to the neighborhood a couple years back, but gave up on it after too many dismal experiences.The servers don't smile and don't pay attention to you if you don't ""fit the scene.""  If you don't wear form-fitting jeans, an ironic t-shirt, and are actually gainfully employed (not relying on trust-fund checks), you might as well be invisible to them."
Don't be dumb...Chicago Diner is over priced and not that tasty. BITE trumps most vegetarian friendly options:- its BYOB- its right next to a great music venue- laid back environment- I ruv tempeh. Perfect easy meal out. Don't go in expecting romance...just a nice laid back pre-game to great music next door.
"Service: Not the best in town. That Saturday night, it seemed they were low in staff so the one waiter was completely frazzled and impatient. Food: Amazing! The chicken & dumpling was hearty and flavorful.  Also, being lactose intolerant, it was such a relief to eat a stew not loaded in cream. Will definitely return to this place."
"I came back to bite for dinner and it was actually wonderful. Had a different server this time (maybe one of the managers/owners?) and it was a great time. Food was great, they were really on their game and attentive. Loved it. Will be back! Thanx Bite!"
"Nice ambiance, good service, great food."
"I've only eaten here for brunch, and I've had a good experience every time.  Sweet or savory, they have something for everyone, with super hip yet nice service to boot.  They have a number of Mexicanish breakfast options that are always good, I enjoy the pancakes and challah French toast too.  Minus one star for coffee that always tastes a bit burnt.  Looking forward to trying it for dinner- loves me a good BYOB!"
"I had high hopes for Bite. The warm, earthy, hip interior appealed to me. The price was right and I liked the look of the menu, with it's updated American classics. But, we made the mistake of going there recently on a freezing cold Friday night. The hostess told us that they could seat us in 1/2 hour and that we could wait next door in the Empty Bottle bar and have a drink. This sounded acceptable, so we were led to the Empty Bottle via a side door that connects one business to the other. The bartenders at the bar told us that they weren't serving. They were closed while setting up for a concert. When we said (nicely) that we were waiting for a table next door and that we wouldn't be seated for a 1/2 hour, the hard-ass bartender chic said we could wait outside if we didn't like it. So, we sat without drinks on a ratty couch in the chilly bar, trying not to get hit in the face with the butt ends of people's pool ques as the 1/2 hour wait turned into an hour. The bar eventually opened just before we finally got our table. We were able to carry our drinks next door with us. They were the only drinks we had that night, because Bite alcohol comes from the Empty Bottle and the bar stops serving restaurant customers at 8PM, or something. It's a very confusing alcohol system. The table next to us was also having trouble figuring it out why they were being cut off mid meal. All of this would have been OK if a friendly server had greeted us at our table and said "" Thanks for being so patient."", or something, but instead, we were greeted by a tired and cynical waiter who was apparently more miserable than we were. I won't make the mistake of going to Bite again.Oh, ......the food was fine."
"If I had to pick one restaurant in Chicago to eat at every day ... it would most definitely be Bite. I don't mind waiting in the bar (Empty Bottle) next door for some grub here ... mostly because it's always fresh, filling, and is almost like a trendy/gourmet/casual/hip type joint. It's quite small, but the intimate nature of the seating doesn't take away from the experience. You can see the cooks busy at work in the kitchen through an uncovered doorway, and while it might seem tacky, it adds to the petite, casual nature of the dining experience.I recommend Bite for brunch. The challah french toast is divine and the breakfast potatoes are always cooked to perfection. Don't forget to look at the specials board, though, as my boyfriend and I almost did a few weeks ago. On one adventure there was strawberry cream cheese stuffed french toast, which was probably the most delicious breakfast food I'd had in eons. There's veggie options and always a bounty of desserts to choose from. The regular menu is ever-changing, and the specials menu carries edible treats, as well as drinks (I had watermelon lemonade this past weekend -- it was delish and fresh!). My only gripe might be that the orange juice is never enough (the small is almost a kiddie-size cup) and the servers aren't always the friendliest. You can sense the frenzy, as it's usually two to the dining room at any given hour. But the food and rotating art makes up for any discomfort you sense from your waiter/waitress. I highly recommend Bite, whether you live in the neighborhood or are just looking for a new place for brunch, lunch or dinner. The fish is delish, the desserts are heavenly, and the prices are outstanding for the size, portions and taste of the dishes. An average meal for myself and my beau is around $30.00.Don't miss this local gem ... !"
"My last review about  Bite cafe was  about how disappointed I was when it reopened, but, urged by a couple of friends who said it had improved a lot, I finally went back a few times recently.  It really has improved a lot, and everything I have had has been good.-- bi bim pop's vegetables fresh (my favorie), hangover salad, beet salad, burger, Mac and cheese- are all darn good. Vegetarian selection more than decent.  Any drink you want can be bough at bar next door-- nice set up.  Not cheap, but not expensive either- better than average kitchen."
"After hearing good things about Bite from quite a few friends, I had my first dining experience here on Saturday.  I was surprised to see that it wasn't crowded at all for a Saturday late morning, but that probably helped with the great service we had.  Our waitress was really nice, relaxed (but not too) and attentive.  I had the super bagel with home fries and a side of the gouda chicken sausage.  Both were awesome!  If I wasn't moving out of the neighborhood I would make this one of my regular breakfast joints!"
"I used to go to Bite regularly and enjoyed their food. The place used to also be pretty packed, and waiting for a table would usually be worth it.The last Bite experience I had (about two weeks ago) has pretty much deterred me from ever coming back again even though it's just down the street from my place and the food can be decent.Two weekends ago my friend and I went there for a late Sunday brunch (around 2:30) and the service we received (or lack thereof) really pissed me off. I haven's seen my friend in about 5 years and wanted everything about her visit to be cool and positive. We sat ourselves as we were waved at to do. We waited for either of the two waitresses to acknowledge us. One finally arrived with two menus and waters without saying ""hello"" or ""would you like some coffee?"" She walked away, as I was asking her if i can get a cup of coffee. The coffee arrived, but no cream, so i tried to make eye contact she looked at me but continued to ignore me, so i went up to the counter to ask for cream.Then she returned and said ""if you're doing breakfast, we gotta do this now"". I was fully aware of that as it said in the menu that Brunch is served till 3. It was about 2:50 at this point. My friend and I each ordered an egg sandwich.Our food arrived, and again, the server didn't bring any ketchup or hot sauce, despite the fact that the other diners seemed to have been graced with enough precious attention to receive them. Again, I went up to ask for ketchup... The food was fine, whatever, it's not like we ordered anything that we expected to blow our minds.Anyway, the check arrived and I couldn't wait to get out of there. I apologized to my friend for the shitty service, I paid and we left.The thing that really annoys me is the fact that there are tons of people out there in need of jobs who would probably treat everyone with respect, but instead the servers @ Bite are unfriendly and make you feel like you're bothering them. The other part of this is the fact that I work as a waitress in  a diner as well and I would NEVER treat a customer with so much disrespect, no matter what. As a server, and a very friendly one, I expect to get decent service and am very understanding if I see that a server may be too busy to get to me right away, however, I am also very aware if a server just doesn't give a damn about his or her customers and just hates his/her job.Sorry, Bite, I'm not coming back, if I want to be treated like crap, I'll go to Ed Debevick's, at least there it's funny and part of the servers' jobs to be rude."
Had an an excellent jerk tofu and an amazing chocolate pie.
"Excellent, friendly servers, and delicious food that will only put a teensy, tiny dent in your wallet. I chowed down, and my total was less than $15!!! And I STILL had food leftover!I went there for breakfast this morning, I ordered the apple chicken sausage and a goat cheese, spinach and tomato omelette (with THREE iced cofffees)!It's sort of a greasy spoon diner, minus the greasiness.I've lived one block from this place for three years, and this was my first time I showed my face there. But this won't be the last they see of me!  ;)"
"Service: Waitstaff is very ""zen"", plenty of tattoos, friendly but rarely verbal, love to refill 3/4 full water glasses and coffee cupsFood: DelishCoffee: DelishAtmosphere: Adorably suited to the area: tats, brown/baby blue color scheme, a ceiling that is just saggy enough to give the place characterPeople: Laid-back, hangin' out, tattoos, friendly, grown-up hipstersSo, I'm a little sad after visiting this place. It's such a great place! Great food (super-tasty and good portions)! Great vibe! Great decor (cute without trying too hard)! But you do not want ""zen"" verbally-challenged waitstaff. We walked in, were not acknowledged for 10 min's. There were 6 open tables, but all were dirty. Staff kept walking past dirty tables, just kind of looking at them and then walking back to the kitchen empty-handed (couldn't they have taken the dishes with them as long as they were going?). The waiter came over to take the order of the couple next to us; they'd been sitting there for 15 min's since we'd been there (so, longer than that)... instead of taking our beverage or food order at the same time (efficiency?), he kind of wandered around the restaurant as tho in a trance after leaving their table and eventually made it back to the kitchen to (theoretically) put their order in. The dirty tables didn't get cleaned for about 25 min's... and the stream of in-coming customers was steady. (Some gave up and left.) No one entering seemed to know what to do (do we sit? do we wait for someone to seat us?). We entered at noon. Finally left at 1:30. (And only b/c I asked for the check as soon as they brought our food. I knew that if we waited for the check passively, we'd be sitting there for 1/2 hour after our food was done.) I think the server said 20 words to us the whole time. I was watching and the rest of the staff (cooks, etc.) had that same, zen, wandering style. Not the best way to go when you're packed on a Saturday. The management needs a little lesson in how to train its staff to be speedy if they want to stay open in a city filled with great brunch spots.I'm really hoping the service improves b/c I do like the place... :("
"Y'know, I've been to Bite a few times now.  And I really, really want to love it.  It's a cute little neighborhood BYO joint with tasty-sounding food.  But the reality is just that I've never had anything memorable here.  Nothing is bad, don't get me wrong.   The ingredients are fresh and the food is prepared well.  But there just isn't much to write home about.  For tonight's visit, I started with the house salad with the mustard vinagrette.  Standard greens and tomoatoes, but the dressing was not good.  Stick with one of the other dressings.  My boyfriend had a bowl of chili to start, and we both found it to be really, really bland.  The bf had the falafel for his entree, which he seemed to like.  I had one of the night's specials, pumpkin risotto.  And it just wasn't that great.  I can't say I really thought it tasted like pumpkin at all.  3 stars for brunch.  But brunch is hard to mess up.  I'll still stop by for a quick dinner here - it's cheap and around the corner from my boyfriend's place.  Other than that, meh."
"Based on my experience, I don't get why this place receives so many accolades.  The food is average at best (though the potatoes were slayin'), it ain't all that cheap compared to some, and the waitstaff is extra-hipster-surly (those who've been to Lulas will know what I mean).  This place would be gone already if it wasn't connected to the Empty Bottle. I've paid less money for much more food of equal quality elsewhere, sans the wannabe boho vibe.  In all fairness I've only been there for breakfast, so I have no idea what the other meals are like. I'd give it another star if not for the 'tude.  Seriously, what's with the art school waiter snootiness?  This place is Lincoln Park with tattoos."
"Before I moved to town, I stayed at this guy's house, crashed in his extra bedroom.  I had a sneaking suspicion that there was a spark growing between us, but wouldn't find out till Sunday night's couch-dance.  Sunday morning, we had brunch at Bite.  (I would not three months later move into the neighborhood and eat here far more often.)See, I was hung over and not feeling so well. After we ordered, I excused myself and threw up half a case of Old Style in the alley behind the restaurant.  But when I came back, there was his smiling face and a plate full of tasty pancakes- so welcoming!  I have a squishy soft place in my heart for Bite, where we technically had our first date about 19 mos ago.The menu's ok, but the specials are really what's worth sticking around for- and usually include at least one veg item.  Read the blackboard carefully, though.  Some get quite pricey.The bad part of Bite is the liquor situation.  Since they open the door to the Empty Bottle to let you get booze there, it doesn't allow for, say, a Bloody Mary at brunch.  My advice: BYO flask of vodka and order tomato juice.  Done and done!"
"Bite is like crack cocaine.   I was hooked 9 years ago, on my very first visit.Went to Bite on Friday for lunch, had their excellent vegetarian burrito and some witty banter with the nice server.    Went to Bite on Saturday for brunch, and thought I was stood up on a date (wah!).   Turns out it was the wrong day (whoops!), but definitely not the wrong restaurant.   I know my brunch server by name, and she takes exceptional care of her tables.    She knows the dish I enjoy, then went to the kitchen to have them make me a delicious mushroom sauce to go with my eggs.   It's not on the menu but she got it for me as she knows I'm not a huge Hollandaise fan.OK, so Sunday rolls around, and it's the true day for my date.   I kind of wanted to reschedule it for another restaurant, as I'd been there the past two days.   Wrong.  Different day.   Still delicious.How many restaurants in this city can you visit three days in a row and still want to go back?"
"I used to eat brunch here frequently when I lived around the corner.  They have really good omelettes and skillets, made with interesting ingredients like sweet potatoes and spinach.  The Eggs Bite is a favorite of mine, basically eggs benedict with spinach.  The entire menu is vegan/vegetarian friendly; all meats can be substituted for seitan.  They serve homemade preserves with their toast and the orange marmalade is really great.  The prices are reasonable.  The only down side to this place is the waitress with the really bad attitude.  If waiting tables is so painful she needs to find other employment."
"Food is amazing.  Visited here on two recent occasions, the atmosphere is great, all windows in the front bring great light in during the day and create a cool ambiance at night.  My friend and I went family style and shared the mac n cheese (!!!!) grilled cheese and tomato soup and the pulled pork sandwich, yummmmmm.  The grilled cheese is made with at least three cheese and the soup is the best tomato I've ever had.  Pulled pork does not disappoint and let me just go ahead and admit we tried all three desserts because they all sounded so good we couldn't agree on one!"
"I've eaten here two Saturdays in a row--once alone and once with a friend--and though I'd eaten here before, I'd not previously been a Yelper. The past two weeks have shown me that Bite may have a couple of bad-apple servers (unfriendly and happy to ignore the lone diner with a twenty-dollar-bill stuck on top of the check and shoved to the edge of her table for about 15 minutes even though he had only two other tables of patrons [and Robyn N.--I think this is exactly who you're referring to. He's kind of a knob, but fortunately for me he wasn't my main server, he just took care of my check. He could use a swift kick in the rear-end.]), but the majority are just friendly enough not to hover over tables and very efficient. The food is fresh and quick (5 minutes, tops, and their bacon is niiiice and cripsy), they don't mind customizing their meals (breakfast burrito sans eggs is no problem--sometimes restaurants pre-make their burrito mix and can't do this for me, so it makes me happy when restaurants can!). The only major complaint was that they're not great about refills on water or coffee. Something small like this does make a difference, but I guess when the food comes out so fast, it doesn't give you too much time to  yearn for that second (third...fourth...) cup of joe."
"I ate some cauliflower soup and a portabello mushroom sandwich and got food poisoning two hours later. It was the only place I'd eaten that day. Never again, Bite!"
"Bruch was ok...nothing special and not especially cheap.  If you are a local looking for a brunch place, give this place a try.  The best part was that there was basically no wait for our table on a Sunday at 11:30AM, which is rare to find in the city.  I don't live in Uk Village so I likely won't be traveling back to eat here again, but if I lived walking distance, i am sure I would return.  The breakfast tacos were good.  The bacon was sub-par.  The coffee was average."
"Good stuff here, like that it's BYO and it's cute & comfy.  Ordered the half red mac & cheese, which was garlicy & delicious and the half order was more than enough for two.  We ordered strangely I will admit but it was all good.  The fries were good & hot & crispy.  The tofu ceviche was surprisingly good but a tad too salty.  And the tostada should have come on the side instead of beneath the ceviche because it got soggy very quickly.  Green curry chicken packed some heat and was very fresh & great on a chilly night.  I must be getting older because I really appreciated the fact that they were not playing music.  No yelling to have a conversation, *yay*!  I will go back.  But they really need to get rid of the foam take home boxes.  Use foil, those big foam boxes are horrible!"
"Bite has a good location for pre or post Empty Bottle shows, simply because it is part of Empty Bottle (or at least they have conjoining doors). But the food isn't anything terribly special, but it does have some unique dishes for elitist vegetarians. If I'm craving the snooty indie atmosphere for food, I'd much rather go to Pick Me Up Cafe which has some really really good dishes."
"Gourmet breakfast was nice....but where are the hangover cures?!  Granted, i was nursing a tough one after stumbling home from the night before.  But come on!  I needs me some grease in the morning.   All that being said, the food was good.  It was expensive but good.  I had the Banana-nut French toast with Mixed Berries and cinnamon butter.  But apparently they thought I was on a diet because there was only two slices!  The coffee was really good.  So that is a plus.I will be back again.  Especially when I am in a yuppie relationship with my Lexus SUV and a little dog that wears sweaters!:|"
"The red mac n cheese and the green curry are great. But I've also had the mediterranean (maybe it was moroccan?) sandwich (that tasted like foot).  The menus are cute. Everyone, including waitstaff, is painfully hip, though, staring you down behind their ironic glasses with jeans up to their tits.  There's one scruffy blonde waiter that is pretty friendly, though."
"My favorite brunch place in Chicago. And mind you, this is a city that is overrun with brunch places. Best thing on the menu is their tasty version of Eggs Benedict, but with some sort of chili sauce gunk and spinach. All the food choices are solid, and they always have fun specials.It's right next door to the Empty Bottle and they share the same bathrooms, so you can pretend that you're still rocking out with your hipster-self, even if you're there with your parents on a Sunday morning."
"I've been there for brunch, lunch and dinner.  Always great food.The omelette's are top notch - i love the broccoli and bacon and the chorizo the most.  If yr there for dinner check out the orecchiette, the catfish tacos, the catfish sammich, the burritos and the dinner specials on the chalkboard.Oh, and it's BYO, and you can step thru the door to buy a drink at the Empty Bottle."
"Bite is fantastic. The bf and I live just a few blocks away and we eat breakfast, lunch, or dinner there on a regular basis. I can't say that either of us has ever been disappointed with something we've ordered. More importantly, we've spent many a dinner in near silence, save for the smacking of our lips and clanking of silverware. The last time we were there, I ordered the fish special (dijon encrusted whitefish with leek, tomato & herb compote, served on savory lentil cakes!) and--no kidding--it was so delicious that I scooped up every last bit on my plate. I really can't think of a better value for super tasty meals than Bite. Always plenty of coffee flowing at breakfast, fluffy omelets...the catfish tacos totally rock and the rest of the regular menu is almost as good....but, if you go for dinner, I highly suggest digging into one of the specials. They are phenomenal--and truly the highlight of what Bite has to offer!And don't forget dessert..."
"Gross!  The taste, the place, the service and specially the kitchen.  The server was smoking outside while I was entering, he asked me what I wanted, how the hell should I know he is the server when he is standing on the side walk.  Whatever, I go in.  It is dirty as it had been the past 3 times I visited.  Whatever again, I sit with my friends, who for some reason frequent this place.  The server kept grabbing my coffee cup by the rim while refilling.  When I asked him to hold it by the handle he looks at me like I am a bitch.  Wait a minute, he should thank me for teaching him how to fill coffee properly.  The filthy stench from the bathroom the dirty ass kitchen with sweat and snot dropping on the food, the food tasting like cardboard I was done with my food in a couple bites.  Never again am I subjecting myself to humiliation, degradation and sickening food.  Yuck!"
"So, I think my Sunday has gone pretty well.1) I turned someone else on to my stylist at Barbara & Barbara. It really was the Miller High Life that made her fall in love. 2) I got my haircut (for $20!!!).3) I got brunch with Kara (the stylist) and her lady.So four of us sit down for brunch. A few things that were memorable:1) Ordered the country fried steak special. For $10, I got the steak in a mushroom gravy, hash browns, 2 eggs over easy, and and toast. Honestly, it tasted like someone cooked it at home and it was pretty darn good. Loved it. Will order again.2) Service was aloof as other people pointed out, but I had everything I needed. They're not rude here...they're just not going to ask about your life story which is fine by me!3) BYOB but I got a bloody mary from The Empty Bottle next door. That was the only weak thing. $4.50 or something. Cheap, yes but I got it in a tiny glass when I saw other patrons have huge ones. Oh well. It was ok. Next time, I'll stick to a beer.4) You have to walk through the kitchen to use the bathroom. Yes, the bathroom is a little scary....but nothing compared to the motherland. Little bonus...at least this place isn't scared to show you how they prepare their food. That's always nice coming from a restaurant.Verdict, I'll definitely be back. Other brunch places have my heart but I will be sure to stop in after a weekend haircut. :)"
"They have a regular breakfast/lunch menu and that food is not bad at all but the specials are usually awesome and cheap. I had a rosemary braised pork w garlic mashed potatoes off the board and it was a HUGE portion and it was super delicious. It was also under $10, super awesome! Service is always great and they never stop pouring coffee for you which is hard to find."
"While my previous opinions still stand, I just had to add that I like that you can get beer from the Empty Bottle next door for the BYOB, and also head over for food after. So thats a benefit I guess. But the dinner food is mediocre."
"I used to go to Bite for brunch on a fairly consistent basis.  I liked it a lot.  I could get poached eggs and a side of spinach.  I could get a delicious tofu breakfast burrito.  The service was always fine -- nothing spectacular, but it got the job done.  Then came an experience beyond all comprehension.  My boyfriend and I ordered omelets when there were literally two tables in the place, besides ourselves.  A group of three then ordered after us.  They got their food in a reasonable amount of time, while we still waited.  Curious, but not totally outside the realm of possibility.  Then another table came in and another, however there were never more than five tables at any given moment.  Each and every person who arrived after us ordered their food, recieved their food, ate their food and sent their empty plates back while we still waited for our motherfucking omelets.  The server could not have cared less.  He asked my boyfriend when he checked on the situtation, ""Why, are you hungry?  Got somewhere to be?""  The server then explained that there was only one guy working in the kitchen, which is fine and all, only this one guy found the time to make food for literally everyone else but us.  It felt almost personal, like we were being driven away.  Only, having worked plenty in restaurants ourselves, we're always polite restaurant goers who tip well and demand very little (except, of course, some food).Basically, after 50 minutes we left.  12 other customers, most of whom weren't even in Bite when we placed our order, got their food while we never saw shit.  It was unbelievable.  And now I can never go back there.  Sad."
"Seriously, I'm not really cool enough for this retro-ly modern place with its paintings of superman, prince charles, superman and prince charles, superman and prince charles and william.  Surprisingly, however, the waiters didn't really seem to mind.  My friend and I went during lunch time on a tuesday because we wanted breakfast and our usual place stops serving at 11.  I LOVED IT.  I purchased a ridiculously inexpensive salmon scrambler (less than ten bucks).  My friend tried the raspberry pancakes (best ever).  These were both on the specials board, not the menu, and they were AMAZING.I liked the vibe.  I thought the service was quick (although I had just gotten back from Jamaica so any service would be quick comparatively)... and the food was fantastic.  Prices were cheap.  My kinda place...even though I'm not really hip enough to be there."
"I've been here for breakfast twice so far, and was impressed both times. The food is great. It's a little pricier than diner food, but still inexpensive, and definitely worth it. My favorite so far as been the feta and herb omelette. The service and decor/atmosphere is nice as well (and the menus, printed inside old, unbound books are pretty adorable as well)."
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE byob restaurants.  I rely on Bite for Orchiette pasta, amazing green curry, and a very tasty burrito.  Bite has a great atmosphere, especially in the summer with the windows open but I question their taste in Artwork."
"Great local joint with some higher-end extras, food-wise.  The beer's good and cold from the Empty Bottle next store."
"Bite has so much going for it.  The staff (meaning... the one server who kept very busy by taking care of every table) is extremely friendly and helpful and walks the thin line of the perfect amount of chattiness.The place is perfect for a saturday brunch and takes care of the basics.  And for a Chicago trendy breakfast spot, this place is surprisingly cheap!  I get kind of tired of paying $10 for eggs and pancakes I can make at home.  Bite makes some unique dishes and charges a fair price.I'll be heading back... the dinner menu looked really good, so I'm guessing sooner rather than later."
"Edit 4/15/2008:I now live across the street from this fine restaurant. We frequent breakfast on the weekends. I have gone for dinner numerous times as well. I always leave happy, full and feeling good about what I ate. The ingredients are fresh and the food seems to almost be ""healthy"". I almost always order from the specials board, but have never been disappointed with anything I have tried. Also, the service is always great, everyone is so friendly! I am adding 1 star, making this a 5 star review. Original:Pretty good brunch type food. I split the  banana nut french toast with mixed berries and cinnamon butter and the super bagel. Both were really good. The food was really tasty. Good quality, fresh, simple, delicious. Nice atmosphere to chill on a Saturday morning/afternoon."
"I've been to Bite quite a few times now and I only end up loving it more every time I go. It's BYOB and they offer a fairly substantial amount of vegetarian options--in other words, this is my kind of place! The Veggie Double Cheeseburger with the Sweet Potato Fries is my current obsession--it has that charred, right off the grill, smokey bbq kind of taste that just makes you think of summer time, even in the dead of winter. The prices are fairly reasonable and the waitstaff is attentive enough. Last time I was there they had Blood Orange Cheesecake as one of their dessert options... if you have the chance to take a bite of that, don't miss out!"
"Unique, vegetarian-friendly menu, reasonable prices, cute, comfy atmosphere, and delicious salad (the Bite Salad) and desert (peach cheese cake). The only reason this isn't getting five stars is because I wasn't crazy about my wrap, it was a little bland. The Thai green curry was delicious and was a nice twist on your average Thai curry. It could have been a little less salty though. Will definitely be coming back."
"Bite is my favorite brunch place.  Maybe it's because I live right around the corner, but even if I had to make the trek it would still receive top-billing.  There never seems to be more than a 15 minute wait on weekends, which for a hipster brunch place is pretty good.  The food is excellent, the perfect combination of fresh and greasy (that's meant in a good way).  I usually get the chorizo/seitan vegetable hash, but the eggs bite or corned beef hash are also highly recommended.  The service, well, I've had better, but they keep my coffee cup filled so really, I don't see much of a problem.  It's byo, or you can go over to Empty Bottle and get drinks after 11 am.  Drinks excluded, you can have your brunch and eat it too for around $10, which is something pretty special."
"Finally on Yelp!  I was hoping the reviews stating lack of taste were BS, but upon trying the open face BBQ pork sandwich with sweet potato fries, I am afraid they were right.  The girlfriends black bean burger was even worse so.  The atmosphere is nice and BYOB before going to a show next door is a real plus too.  If you're going to open a restaurant though, taste is a fairly crucial element.  Sweet potato fries were soggy, burnt and absolutely tasteless, BBQ pork needed BBQ sauce or salt or something!  We had the lavender marinated pear short cake which was probably the best part, however the short cake was dry dry dry.  The specials sounded amazing.  Maybe they stole all the flavor from the regular menu items.  :\"
"I went with another couple on Friday Night.  It has been a while since I have eaten here and will be coming back soon.  The food was great - the waiter was ok.  Food wise we had blackend catfish tacos, a curry, fried fish and a pasta dish.  All were great."
"Went here today for lunch. Ordered a grilled cheese sandwich with cheddar and it arrived 30 (not an exaggeration) minutes later. Not one word from the waiter in the meantime. No offer to refill drinks, no apology for keeping us waiting for the same amount of time it would take to cook a whole friggin' chicken. And when it did arrive, it was a joke of a grilled cheese sandwich on dry bread with motherf**king American cheese. I'd have sent it back for cheddar, but I didn't have another 20 minutes to blow. Never again."
"I have only been to bite for breakfast, so their breakfast menu gets 5 stars from me, as do the morning servers and kitchen staff. I have eaten there about 4-5 times, and tried meals from the special board as well as the regular menu, and i have to say its all been great.Good coffee, wonderful server, not over priced, nice and mellow and tons of great options."
"I love their BBQ pork on cornbread sandwich! Good burgers, decent thai food. I usually come when it's not too busy, and service has always been great! I love the artwork they have on the walls- it has a very welcoming and cozy vibe."
"Living in the hood, its great to see how far this place has come since re-launching this year.  The breakfast seasonal specials are usually fantastic, the service laid back but attentive and the prices spot on.  I went in this AM and had a pork hash, which is easily the best simple brunch item I have had in years!"
"Strange place. A couple years ago I went here with a few of my friends. Upon entering, we expected to receive the token restaurant greeting (""Good morning, sit wherever you'd like"" etc). Didn't happen. Eventually, an employee, some pale and socially stunted guy, did manage to hobble towards us, grunt out ""ay,"" and point us to a table. Then we sat and waited for a server to dignify us for 10 minutes. Nothing. We tried to flag someone down. No luck. This little game of ""catch the waitress"" went on for another 10 minutes until a cranky woman came to our table, folded her arms, and rasped out something along the lines of, ""What  do you want?"" At that point my friends and I realized that the rude and insulting behavior of the staff was not a sign of their ignorance and venality but of ours. Why? Because we forgot that it is the inalienable right of every hole-in-the-wall cafe proprietor to choose their own customers. Worse, after failing to meet the rigid hipster criteria of the Bite-worthy, we actually had the gall to remain seated and act a bit surprised. So that's it for Bite. I'm never going back and astonished that anyone would waste their time. Avoid it unless you enjoy ""velvet rope"" theatrics with your omelet."
"Does anyone else feel like they're bothering the waitstaff by eating and drinking at Bite? Or was it just because I wasn't wearing a Where's Waldo scarf and skinny black jeans?  It's a quaint locale, but the mediocre food surely isn't enough to make me put up with the holier than thou staff."
"This is a great neighborhood joint. I am always taking people here (and I think it was actually the first Chicago restaurant I ever ate in. awww.) It has such a great feel inside and the prices are right. I am a big fan of their fried tofu appetizer, pasta dishes and fish specials. But, as others have noted, the deserts here are the real tour de force. Just superb. I had a Peanut Butter and Jelly Parfait here once that was truly one of the best deserts I have had in my life. I used to attempt to recreate it but always failed. All this is to say: go to Bite for dinner and save room for desert. It is a special place."
"Bite is one of those unique places where you don't spend a bundle but get quality food, service, and a friendly, indie art atmosphere. I'd strongly suggest checking out their brunch - you can pick among many tasty entrees and get your choice of drink for $8 plus tip, which is a bargain considering the rising prices of wicker park. Bite is vegan/vegetarian friendly, yet you can still find tasty meat or meat-like dishes that'll satisfy the best carnivores of you out there. To top it off you've got awesome artwork that's both unique and tasteful. Check em out, you wont regret it!"
"We've driven past this place a million times and finally went in for dinner last night.  I just LOVED it!  The staff was really nice, the atmosphere perfect (dim, comfy and not too loud) and the food was super awesome.  Between the very fair prices and it being BYOB, I felt like I ate like a queen for very little money.  I will definitely be back."
Good stuff.Wish I could get over there more often. Everything on the menu (and the specials onthe wall) sounds delish.And BYOB never fails.
"Decent food, nothing to write home about but the service was AWFUL. We went last Sunday for brunch and told there would be a 25 minute wait. After 45 minutes waiting, I noticed at least 5 parties that came in AFTER us, had been seated. We went to inquire and the hostess just said ""oh thats my mistake, I am sorry"". I am sorry that's ridiculous and not acceptable. Sunday brunch is always busy and it's important to keep the wait list correct and not ""accidentally"" cross of someone's name. Amateur. We were seated after an hour and at least expected our coffee's to be paid for but nothing was offered to us and the service continued to be slow. We weren't given the correct utensils, took forever to order and the food was just okay... typical Chicago heavy food. I was going to order the Eggs Benedict but the person next to us had it and it had a pound of creamed spinach, which looked disgusting. I used to like this place but they need more experienced servers and if a big mistake is made, the management should at least offer to buy your drinks at the very least."
"Bite is pretty solid. It has something for everyone. i went here for lunch with my mother. we REALLY wanted to try the polish grill across the street, but alas, it was closed.i had spicy eggs and my mom had pancakes. super good. i also like that you can buy libations from the empty bottle. that's super cute.they have bad ventilation, so you'll probably end up smelling like the kitchen, but then you can relive your meal all day long!!"
"I love Bite, it's right round the corner from our place and it's a great, hip spot for brunch and lunch (never been to dinner there). Seems some yelpers are put off by the staff. I agree the servers are rather laid back and don't put on the fake cheery attitude you'll see at Bennigan's, but that actually fits the place, simple yet recherché. You sit where you want and everybody around you is beautiful and looks as if was 1991. The falafel platter is amazing, and so are most specials. We always bring a bottle of wine, pick up the Onion and Reader in the doorway and get a great lunch for $6-8 dollars each."
"I thought I would like this place as I was told it was similar to Flying Saucer, but much closer to my house with more accessible hours of operation.  I found the food to be okay and the service to be just fine and friendly...but I didn't like how the kitchen was so close and exposed to the cramped seating area that I walked outta there smelling like a fried egg."
"a neighborhood staple. pretty simple foods, but tasty.service is friendly and attentive.i rarely order off the menu, as there is usually something pretty interesting on the ""specials"" board."
"I like this place! I've only been here for breakfast in the early morning, but every time I've been there the staff has been nice and the food has been good.  I'll have to check out their dinner options sometime.  I've had the cornmeal pancakes and those are pretty good."
"I love this place, it's one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  The menu has a variety of foods, prepared with the chef's own twist.  I haven't had anything I didn't like, but I specifically recommend the orchiette.  The deserts are always amazing.  The serve three or four deserts any given day, but they are never the same.  On several occasions, the group I was with decided to order them all so we could all try all of them."
"I don't care what anyone says - I love this place.  The servers are always nice to me, so I don't know what anyone else is talking about.  The food is fresh and I always enjoy the vegetarian special.  The take-out is good as well.    I've also had their brunch, yum.I appreciate the nice, cute guy that works there who always talks to me about whatever book I happen to have.  I live so close to you, Bite, and we get along so perfectly.  Love."
"Bite--how i heart thee.  youre always there when I'm too lazy to cook. and youre always there when im so so hungover.altho i do not like leaving smelling like you, i still come back.  and the servers have learned that my blank stare when they greet me just means i had a good night."
"The atmoshpere is understated and nice.  I like to grab dinner here on weeknights when its not very busy.  I'm always impressed by the soups and the specials are excellent.  I've ordered off the regular menu and its good (but as others have said, nothing to write home about).  This place is really all about the special (at least for dinner)."
"I absolutely love the food at this little gem.  The food is always very fresh and the menu has many delicious healthy selections.  The place is often busy and the tables are snug.  It has a laid-back hippie vibe.  The service is generally satisfactory.  Although it's BYOB, you can always snag a pint of beer from the bar next door and bring it in;They have a great selection of craft beers.  Don't skip desert, although there are only about three to choose from, they are always sumptuous, creative creations, worthy of an overprice, snooty, upscale  restaurant.  This restaurant would easily garner a five-star rating (and I am a very tough critic) except for the atrocious state of the bathroom, which reminds you of a gas station bathroom where they give you a key attached to a piece of wood.  You have to do ""the hover"" and in the winter you're terrified that your clothing may accidentally touch the floor (ick!)  There is only one bathroom and you have to go through the kitchen to get to it.  whenever I go, I avoid going to the bathroom, however, unfortunately, I have a small bladder.  Why does this restaurant, which apparently puts so much attention and creativity into the food, force it's patrons into the inner circle of Dantes inferno?"
"The new and improved Bite is great! The new interior is clean and warm. The new windows and woodwork make a huge difference. The menu is smaller but new and exciting. I ordered the Egg Poutine dish which was great. Nice flavor, not as ridiculously rich as I feared it would be. They were sure to balance it with pickled peppers and some fresh herbs. My boyfriend ordered the Banana French toast with pecans which was also good. I was happy to see that prices didn't change too much either. I did have a minor problem with the first plate they sent me, I usually don't send things back, but they were so quick to replace with another table's order that hadn't been finished yet, that I barely was behind my boyfriend. His food didn't get the chance to get cold. They also comped the mistake. I am sad that we are moving in May, because I will miss our handy lunch/breakfast place, especially since it just reopened."
"Eh. There are enough restaurants in Chicago (and if you're super hungry and going to a show, you're probably better off waiting for the Tamale guy). I keep coming back here and every time I wonder what possessed me. I always get the same waiter, who is always snotty with me. The vegan options are totally bland and disappointing and the staff (granted, I can only speak to the one waiter who is ALWAYS my server) is NOT helpful. It's too bad, because there are very few places to get a vegan meal and a good draft beer, but you're definitely better off going to the Handlebar and getting good food and good service."
"I went here for the first time last night, which is kind of shameful since I have lived two blocks away from it a few years now. I found the space to be cozy, reminiscent of a college town cafe with no-frills furniture, local art and somewhat closely packed tables. The sign at the entrance kindly suggests you let the outer door close before opening the inner door to the cafe to conserve heat. The dining room was clean but not pristine, and the kitchen, from what I could see, looked reasonably tidy.The menu is definitely eclectic, everything from burritos to seafood to pasta dishes. My friend got a BBQ pork sandwich that, while not as good as what you'd get at a dedicated BBQ joint like Fat Willy's, was certainly decent. I got these tacos that used seitan ""chorizo"" (you can also get them filled fish or pork). Now, I'm no vegetarian, but our waitress suggested it as her favorite, and having never eaten such a thing before, I decided to give it a try. It was surprisingly good, and the meal definitely hit the spot.Which leads me to the main complaint I see in other reviews, namely the service. Our waitress was quite pleasant, helpful, and speedy with our drinks, meals, and check. The food came a little slowly, most likely because it seemed like only one or two people were manning the kitchen. But the wait was not unreasonable. So to those who received bad service in the past, I would suggest checking it out again, because they may notice an improvement. Or maybe I just went there on an evening where the ""good waitress"" was on duty."
"Having just paid too much for a disappointing dining experience at a new BYO place, I couldn't help but think about how Bite does BYO just right.  It's inexpensive, fast, interesting food.  Get the specials.  They're always good."
"*Update* Prices are up quite a bit after the remodeling. Burger is ok. Fried chicken leg sandwich was gross and it cost me $13.  I've lived within spitting distance of the bite cafe for five years now. I feel that the quality of the food dropped down a notch in the last couple of years. I still eat there semi-regularly because I live so close. If you keep your hopes down, and stick with basic items like the sandwiches and desserts, and bring lots of byob, your time there will be ok. The dude that works weekday mornings is pretty cool and makes great coffee. The weekday evening and weekend service staff are not the best, but they can often get over worked when they are busy. Get the grilled cheese with Ham and Provolone. You will be safe with that choice. Stay away from items with sensitive veggies, like spinach, as they don't seem to have the ability to cook them properly.  There is art on the wall and the music can be good."
"I can't believe I didn't rush home to review this place after I first visited. Bite has become my favorite restaurant in Chicago. The food is always top notch. A huge part of any establishment is the staff. I don't recall her name, but every time I go to Bite, the woman (possibly the owner?) working is a joy to be around. She is so nice and chatty and has perfect recommendations if you're not quite sure what to order. The menu changes every few months and there are different specials every night. I love the variety Bite has to offer. If you go there and they have bread pudding, do yourself a favor and order it up!! I can't wait to go back..."
"I recently moved to Humboldt Park and I as much as I enjoy eating at Flying Saucer, I wanted to try somewhere new. My friend and I went to Bite for breakfast a few months ago and the food was amazing. The portion sizes are just right. and the service is always good. The gentleman with tattoos who works in the morning is always friendly and has a great sense of humor.  Tonight I decided to go there for dinner and was equally impressed with the service and quality of food. The catfish tacos and watermelon lemonade proved to be the perfect summer meal. Bite is my new favorite restaurant for sure!!!!"
"Great place for brunch.  We frequent this place for an early afternoon brunch and mimosas most weekends.  Their Eggs Bite(with a tangy holindase sauce), their fritatas and Vegetable Hash with chorizo are delecious.  Its a low key place, no stress, with friendly wait staff.  I definitely recommend."
had breakfast here a while back.cute space. the waitress was not a regular. was filling in last minute for a friend.was a little lost.food took a little longer than it should for a small place with few people in it. had a basic eggs/bacon breakfast. it was a little pricey. dont expect to go back.
"Great vibe, good food and friendly staff. One of my favorite brunch spots!"
"62 reviews ahead of me. Unreal.  I was one of the first patrons.  It opened 5 years ago. During my Chicago visits, I was a regular.   Took mom here for lunch last week.  As always, she loves it.  So cozy.  Great salads and awesome sandwiches.  Ever see the movie Candyman?  It's set in the projects of Cabrini Green...just a few blocks from here (my bad. Erica A corrected me.  It's over 2 miles!) But, no worries.   All gentrified.  Totally taken over by hipsters...like my mom  : (   Bring a lotta coins.  They only have street parking."
"Bite BITES!  This past weekend my husband and I took our two daugthers and my parents- who were visiting from out of state- to Bite.  We walked in and stood there for awhile before one of the waitresses came over to us to ask us how many in our party.  When we said 5 and 1 high chair she told us we had to wait.  I asked if we could push two tables together and she told me NO. She suggested I waited until a group- already sitting at two tables that had been pused together-finish up. Then a couple walked in behind us with their daughter and she immediately seated them and gave the little girl a hi-chair.  When it was finally our turn to sit down, the waitress told us she didn't have a high-chair for us....Short of the long, the waitress had no customer service, was unable to think on her feet, and turned away business that will not come back.  We went to FEED instead.  The food (at FEED) was amazing, the customer service was outstanding and we really enjoyed the amtomsphere!  BITE IS A DISAPPOINTMENT."
I haven't been here in a while but I remember going on a date from hell. The food however I liked and it was the most memorable part of the evening. I love that it is next to the Empty Bottle! Music and yum yums! Good combo!
"I like Bite.  It has a good vibe to it with yummy food at a decent enough price.  I've never had a problem with the waiters not being quick and nice. Keep in mind, though, there can be a bit of a wait if you come for weekend brunch."
