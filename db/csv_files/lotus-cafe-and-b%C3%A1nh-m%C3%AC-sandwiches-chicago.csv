Lotus Cafe & Bánh Mì Sandwiches
"My boss has gone here 3 times in the same week and has said nothing but great things about this place. Today I went there with him for lunch and had a great experience.Vibe:The vibe is perfect. There are lots of tables in there and they even have patio seating. The music is at the perfect volume. This place is perfect for lunch with co-workers, lunch dates, and just a quick bite to eat. Customer Service:When I walked inside we were immediately greeted and I felt like they actually cared that I was there. They recognized my boss from him going so often and I thought that was incredible. The gentleman who rang us up at the counter had a great haircut and he even gave me the number to his barber. Food:INCREDIBLE! My boss loves the sandwiches. I am not really into bread so I had the sesame grilled chicken noodle salad. I wish I knew how many calories were in this but either way it was phenomenal. The amount of sauce was perfect. I cannot vouch for the dressing because I never added it to my salad--the reason I didn't add it is because the sauce from the chicken was already the perfect amount to cover the entire salad. I'm at work two hours later and still feeling perfect. Not too full and not hungry. Price:HELLA CHEAP! We paid $15 total for both of our meals. I'll definitely be back here. Thanks for a great 1st experience!"
"My 400th Yelp Review Milestone, and I dedicate this to my favorite restaurant near UIC (thus far)! Can I get a HELL YEA for Lotus being right next to where I live? Thank Buddha for this amazing place to help keep my banh mi and boba cravings in check!Lotus serves up an amazing, modern take on banh mi. Each sandwich costs around $7 and comes with a variety of ingredients that will make you reconsider the peanut butter and jelly sandwich you brought to work.I've ordered the Honey Grilled Pork for my first sandwich, and that was classic! The bun was nicely toasted and portions were great. Ask for extra cilantro on your sandwich! The second time I got the fried tofu banh mi, and that one was just as amazing. Large pieces of tofu with thin sweet potato fries tucked inside. I loved both of them.They also serve up some fantastic vermicelli bowls. You select your type of noodle, sauce, meat, and condiments to create your own bowl. I must say that the chicken here is on point.Let's not forget the quality of their boba too. Chicago seems to love fruit smoothie boba, and the ones at Lotus are all made from fresh fruit! For less than $4, I got myself a mango-avocado smoothie with boba, and I couldn't be happier! The drink was damn refreshing, and the flavors blended so well together. As for the boba pearls themselves, they weren't stale or rubbery, making it easy to drink.So while it's not the most classic style banh mi with the pate, meats, cilantro, and veggies, it still offers a fantastic new American take on one of my favorite kinds of sandwiches out there. Lotus is definitely my go-to spot on Maxwell now, and I can't wait to try their other sandwiches very soon."
"Whenever we're back in the UIC area, my boyfriend and I always make it a point to stop by Lotus! Their bread is always fresh and warm; I usually switch off between the Sunnyside Beef or the Classic Belly. My boyfriend usually gets the Honey Grilled Pork. I love the fact that the Sunnyside Beef comes with an egg on top and delicious sweet potato strings! It really makes a difference. If we're feeling extra hungry that day, we'll also order some shrimp spring rolls, which come in a HUGE box, so it's definitely enough to share. The sweet pineapple dipping sauce that it comes with is seriously soooo good. Smoothies are never a bad choice but I usually always get the iced jasmine milk tea, which always has a strong jasmine tea flavor but is light and refreshing as well. Sometimes it veers a little to the sweet side but it just makes it that much more refreshing. We will always come back to Lotus whenever we're in the area!"
"Skip the Garden Spring Rolls, not too much flavor there.  The soy glazed chicken wings are interesting, but only average on taste.  Banh mi really stood out (it's in the name after all).  Ginger chicken is perhaps my favorite of all, just excellent flavor   Honey grilled pork a close second, the sweetness isn't that strong but goes well with the lemongrass and garlic.  Sunny-side beef is a solid choice, depends on how you feel about runny egg.  The Belly Classic has pork belly, which I do not care for since it's a fattier cut of meat, so maybe you might like it.  Veggiecado needed a bit more flavor, although it's quite healthy and vegetarian.Lotus will also cater, and by cater I mean delivery large boxes of banh mi.  If you order enough (like 50), they will even expand their delivery range further south to Hyde Park."
"BANH MI MEParking is always a pain in the butt around this neighborhood because of the UIC campus. We had a taste for some Vietnamese sandwiches and planned on doing carry out. When I went to drop my wife off in front, I noticed a sign that said ""Free Parking"". I was so excited about this offer that I told my wife we were dinning in today. The free parking is a nice feature and it will hopefully help all of the businesses around this area by bringing in customers. The sandwich shop is small on the inside but very clean. I noticed some of those college students hanging around using the wifi. This isn't a Starbucks. As a business owner, it would drive me crazy with one person taking up two table spots. I'm so glad I don't have to deal with such problems. We almost fell victim to not getting a seat because there were many solo eaters surfing the internet at two top tables. While we were waiting for our food, a table in the back opened up and we jumped on it. We almost had to go back to our original plan of going with carry out sandwiches because of the lack of seats. Prior to arriving here we made a plan. We were going to order two sandwiches and then split them. We went with the Honey Grilled Pork Banh Mi with Pork shoulder, lemongrass, honey, garlic, scallions, pickled daikon, carrots, cucumber, cilantro & jalapenos. Our second sandwich was the Sunny-Side Beef Banh Mi with Sautéed beef, caramelized onion, sunny-side up egg, and crispy sweet potato fries. Both sandwiches were really good and full of flavor. If I had the choice I would definitely order the Honey Grilled Pork Banh Mi again. The sandwich had the perfect mix of savory, sweet & spicy. I loved every single bite. I was also glad that I chose to eat this sandwich second because it was amazing. My other half sandwich was the Sunny-Side Beef Banh Mi and it was good. I wish that the beef quality was a little better. There is nothing worse then pulling out inedible fat chunks from your mouth full of food. It just makes eating a sandwich an unpleasant experience. Every sandwich bite becomes a challenge because I'm not sure what I will find in there. It's like eating a fish with bones in it. The fish is good but you eat with caution. Would we come back here? Probably because of the close location and the free parking. If I was a college student I would definitely be in here a lot using the wifi and eating sandwiches. My only suggestion to the solo flying college students is to sit in the window counter. This way you're not taking up two seats. It's better for the business and if they close down then were are you going to get your free wifi from."
"Food is a two but the service is great, hence the 3 stars. We came in and got the Sunny-Side Beef and the Ginger Chicken. Everyone on yelp goes bonkers for the Sunny-Side Beef and I don't get why. The egg we got was cooked too long so the yolk was basically hard boiled. Having a nice runny yolk really could of helped out that sandwich. After coming home and looking at the menu for this review, I asked my wife if our sandwich had sweet potato fries in it, and we weren't sure. If it was in the banh mi, we couldn't even taste it. It still wouldn't have helped out the thin slices of beef. The pickled vegetables and cilantro were great though, as well as the french bread. Pretty quality. That goes for both sandwiches. Our second was the Ginger Chicken. This one was much better than the first, a lot more flavor and the chicken was cooked well. Other than that though, its not like its worthy of 4.5 stars like the reviews suggests. Its an average Banh Mi.That goes for the restaurant as a whole. Average. You can get better Mi's at cheaper prices in this city. So go somewhere else and mi up!"
"Disclaimer: this was my first banh mi sandwich experience. That being said, this place has some seriously amazing food! Visited this gem inside the UIC food court and was intrigued by all of their menu options. I had the ginger chicken, which was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The onions and other accompaniments complement the flavors well. The bread was soft on the inside and lightly crusty on the outside. Can't wait to go back and try the honey pork one too!!Update: tried the pork sandwich and it was meh. Think I'll stick with that delicious ginger chicken from here on out!"
"The Banh Mi sandwiches here were pretty good! I would definitely give them both four stars. I ordered the honey grilled pork, and was thoroughly satisfied, and my girlfriend ordered the veggiecado and seemed pretty happy with her choice. We also got one of the rib-eye pineapple vermicelli, and I thought it was just okay. I thought that the meat was marinated well and cooked well - I would give it 4 stars if it was just this. But the noodles just weren't right for me. I wish they had used thinner, more traditional vermicelli - then it could have been really really good.The place is really cute and has FREE PARKING. Wow what a great thing to have. I read their bio on their website, and apparently, this place was started by former students who noticed a lack of Vietnamese food options - which is true! I liked hearing about their story, and it definitely made me want to support them even more!"
"Made a great decision this afternoon and came here! My boyfriend and I ordered the Sunnyside Beef, Classic Belly banh mi, and a cold jasmine milk tea.The Sunnyside beef was amazingly delicious! The beef was tender and flavorful. The Sunnyside egg in it just added to the flavor and made the banh mi incredibly satisfying. I would definitely order this again!The Classic Belly was also delicious! The meat was tender and but not as flavorful after having taken a bite out of the Sunnyside banh mi. All of the banh mi come with cilantro, mayo, and jalapeños, which are some nice touches!The cold Jasmine milk tea was so refreshing and delicious! The milk in it didn't over power and dilute the Jasmine tea flavor. I would order this again in a heart beat as well!"
"With Ba Le in chinatown closing a few months ago, Lotus (located near UIC) is one of the very few banh mi sandwich shops in the south/central area. While I should have looked at the reviews for this place beforehand to get what everyone was raving about with the sunnyside beef, I got the pineapple ribeye vermicelli salad dish. It wasn't bad at all. I loved the fact with this place being as small as it was that they cooked it as I ordered. They also made my Viet coffee perfectly with the less condensed milk I have requested. P.S. They don't have Pho if that is what you are craving for and their spring rolls come in orders of 3 halves. All items are served in to-go containers.It is located at the very end of that one way Maxwell street to your right. Inside is clean with a few seating tables. You order your food at the counter and they will bring your food to you (kind of like a Del Seoul or I guess a typical cafe spot)."
The honey glazed pork banh mi is the best banh mi I've ever had. That says a lot for someone who lives in an Atlanta suburb of high Vietnamese population. Great atmosphere also!
"If you want fresh, quick, delicious food then this is the place to go. We got the shrimp spring rolls and they were so light but so filling, also the peanut sauce was mouth watering!I got the house pork noodle salad and it's really a vermicielli but one that leaves you full after the first few bites. I honestly wanted to get two more to bring home with me!Hubby got the honey grilled pork Banh Mi which was the freshest Banh mi I've ever tasted in my life. If you want a hearty, fresh, filling sandwich with a whole lot of taste this is what to get!Overall, our next vacation to Chicago we'll make sure to come back here!"
"This was my first time trying Vietnamese sandwiches. We ordered ginger chicken sandwich and a tofu sandwich. The portion size was good and I must say it was one of the most flavorful sandwiches I have ever had. What i didn't like, there was a little too much cilantro for my taste. A big plus was free and very convenient parking a few steps from the place, although the parking assistant told us, they would start charging back again from July 13th. I will definitely come back to the place to try the spring rolls and smoothies."
"Initially, I was drawn to the Lotus Cafe because it was a two-in-one deal in my mind. Have some pho and a bahn mi sandwich- YUM! Unfortunately though, we did not find pho on the menu when we visited. It turns out that the lady who makes the pho was on maternity leave and she was the only one that made pho. Sounds like this must have been some really out-of-this-world pho! :-) Truthfully, I was disappointed that we weren't able to order pho but the sunny side beef bahn mi sandwich completely made up for it! The bahn mi sandwich was both fresh filled with cilantro, peppers and sweet potato and hearty filled with beef and a sunny side up egg. I absolutely loved this combination... or anything with a sunny side up egg and beef mixed together. I would've ordered another bahn mi sandwich; however, we were keeping some open space in our bellies for future food stops.About the venue: The Lotus Cafe was quite a trek from where we stayed in downtown Chicago. However, the trip was worth it for the bahn mi sandwich. I agree with other Yelpers that the cafe is small... so think twice before bringing a group of 20 people to eat ON site. Nevertheless, for the space it does have, the Lotus Cafe is tastefully designed. Definitely quaint and youthful!"
June 2015- Delicious! Had then cater lunch for us at work and they brought us a variety of deliciousness! Sandwiches were packaged neatly and clearly marked and we're so fresh! I saved a sandwich for the next day and it was just as good! Can't wait to have more.
"On a random adventure around Chicago, I realized I was near UIC so I asked my friend to stop by Lotus Cafe so I can go buy some banh mi to take home and eat later. The cafe is located on a small one way street and it was convenient for my friend to pull over while I run in and buy some stuff. If you want to park, there is a parking structure a little bit further down or there is also lots of street parking past the structure. It is not free parking though. I ordered the belly classic and the honey grilled pork and the total came out to almost $14. My wallet was crying! I am so used to paying $3-5 for a banh mi. But almost $7 for a banh mi is a bit steep. However, you do get what you pay for. The banh mi is on the larger ends of banh mi that I've eaten. You get pretty full off one 1 banh mi. The ingredients are fresh and they stuff it with cucumber, meat, pickled carrots and daikon, cilantro, and green peppers. I can tell the banh mi is made of quality stuff. I did like the honey grilled pork more than the belly classic, which is just a little less flavorful. I ate the belly classic a day later and it was still good! The bread was not hard at all!The cafe itself is adorable and I love all the traditional Vietnamese decorations. They have a chalkboard column in the middle of the cafe where you can graffiti on and tag stuff. That is a cool thing to have for a college campus store. This is my first banh mi that I have bought since my move from Los Angeles to Chicago. I have been spoiled with good and cheap Vietnamese food and coming to Chicago, I am still not used to paying an arm and a leg for Viet food. I definitely will come back here but I don't think I can afford to eat here so often."
Lotus Cafe has some of the best banh mi sandwiches around the UIC campus. Their wings are also to die for. Compliments to the chef. The service is wonderful and the surroundings are really clean. Ymi Le was the cashier at the time and she was so lovely and friendly. I recommend this place highly! I go here at minimum once a week.
"This is a neat little place on Maxwell St. After skimming through more than half the reviews, I ordered the sunny sided beef, ginger chicken, honey grilled pork and some soy sauce wings for me and two other family members. We all agreed that the ginger chicken was the best! The pork was a bit bland and hard to chew. Also, the Thai iced tea was amazing, but they added half a cup of ice though (like a lot of other drink places).Fyi, parking is free for 2.5hrs in the garage next door! I wish they opened a little earlier than 11."
Did not taste like authentic bahn mi sandwiches. Was excited to try this place based on reviews but was disappointed. Service was friendly.
I tired belly classic and sunny side beef. Both are very fresh and tasty! My personal favor---like belly classic more:)))
"I love this place! Been ordering it delivery for the past year or so but didn't really understand how good it was until I popped in there and had it served fresh. Friendly staff, chill vibe, clean but not too sterile looking. The wooden bar looking out the front window is really nice, especially on a sunny day!Veggiecado was awesome, and the spring rolls are always pretty good too.The game changer was the red bean-coconut smoothie though, which I got under their recommendation. Gotta try this if you get in there. Killer combo."
"The banh mi's here are delicious and on point. Tastes just like home (cali), however it's expensive as hell. It's 5 bucks for 3 banh mi's in Cali. So if you're missing home this is the place to go."
"It was greatly worth walking the 30 minutes here in humid weather to grab lunch. The sunny side beef banh mi was exactly how I wanted it to be. It was my first time having egg in a banh mi but it really worked well. The yolk was cooked to perfection, just enough so that it was runny throughout the sandwich but did not drip anywhere outside or get on my hands. Major props for that. The bread was toasted just the right amount so that it was crunchy without hurting the roof of your mouth when you took a bite. No complaints about the amount of beef or daikon either. Fast, easy, fairly cheap, and full. I envy the UIC undergrads who have this right next to campus! I'll definitely stop by again when I'm nearby and try their other selections."
"I had really high hopes for this place because of the reviews, but I was seriously disappointed! I ordered the honey grilled pork - the meat was really fatty and there was very little of it. The veggies on top were also scarce and had no pickled flavor whatsoever. The bread was decent. I also ordered a jasmine iced tea (plus tapioca) which lacked flavor. I then ordered the taro smoothie (plus tapioca) -- this was pretty tasty! The flavor was unusual and I wasn't sure I liked it, but I kept drinking it til it was gone, so I guess I did! My three items were over $15, with $1 of that being the added tapioca, which I think is silly to charge extra for. I would eat here again in a pinch, but the prices and quality were not worth it. There appeared to be 2 orders in front of mine (the place was basically empty) but it still took about 10 minutes to get my order. It should be noted though that they have a great and unique selection of bottled sodas, teas, and lemonades that would be worth stopping by to try! I found a parking space around the corner, but there is no parking on the street where the cafe is located. There is paid street parking nearby and a parking deck, but nothing free."
"Yep it's as good as they say. I took a trip out to try it and didn't regret it. My eyes were a bigger than my stomach and I ordered way too much, but that didn't stop me from trying to stuff every morsel of food in my mouth. The Sunnyside beef was my fave. The Honey Grilled pork was good, but the beef won me over in the end. The Pho was also quite good - bring someone with you and share it while you each have a sandwich. Their iced coffee was also delicious!"
Best banh mi in Chicago.  My favorites are the classic pork belly and the honey grilled pork.  I only wish they were open later.
"Popped in for a working lunch yesterday after hearing good things about the sandwiches here. You can park for free for up to 2 1/2 hours in the Maxwell St. garage very close to Lotus, hooray! The restaurant itself isn't huge, but has several tables and benches for dine-in customers. There are some nice black and white photos on the wall as well. For food, I had the honey grilled pork banh mi. The pork slices were tender, and sweet and citrusy from the honey and lemongrass, great flavor. It also had mayo and lots of cilantro, which I enjoyed. All the sandwiches typically come with jalapeno, mayo, cucumber, cilantro, daikon, and jalapeno; I just chose to have only the mayo and cilantro as my toppings, I'm odd, I know! You also have the option to add egg or avocado to any banh mi too. The fresh bread was soft and crispy and made a perfect sandwich. My supervisor had the veggiecado with an added egg, and really enjoyed that as well. They were so good, I ordered a ginger chicken banh mi to go to bring home for my fiance to try as well. The banh mi were a pretty quick meal, good service at the counter, decently priced ($6-$7 per banh mi), and definitely tasty. The website says you can order via text, this seems odd, would love to know if that actually works, and ordering online directs you to GrubHub, but doesn't actually have Lotus on GrubHub...just give them a call! I plan to go back for sure; there were some pineapple noodles and a beef banh mi that were also calling to me for next time!"
Good food. Fresh. Made to order. Two thumbs up! I ordered the pork house noodle salad. And their Thai iced tea is perfect
"Just want to reaffirm my love for this place. With an additional tip: try the wings!! They're like Kfc (Korean Fried chicken) style, and they're awesome. Love the egg rolls, the honey grilled pork banh mi, and the ribeye salad. Thank you, Lotus, for bEing awesome. Pro tip: order the noodle salad with a side of peanut sauce, then mix the noodles with the sauce. So good."
"We tried their sunny side beef and the ginger chicken. Although I enjoy anything with an egg on it, I seemed to like the ginger chicken more.  This is a great addition to the university campus and caters well to the student life.However, my go-to bahn mi joints will remain as Ba Le or Nhu Lan due to authenticity, variety and price point."
"I have been meaning to come in and try this place, but still haven't made it in yet.  I have ordered delivery from here several times.  Awesome sandwiches and spring rolls. Their honey grilled pork is my favorite, but I havent' had a bad sandwich from here yet."
Best Damn Sandwiches Ever.I'm in love with the Sunnyside Beef and runner up ginger chicken. Yes I highly recommend especially delicious and they deliver so bonus points. My first time eating their food love it and will eat again also very affordable prices.
"It is a long, long way from River North to University Street on a Divvy. Despite this, I find that I can't wait to make the 20-minute journey south again.I got a bahn mi with scrambled eggs, and a bag of chips. I don't remember the brand name of the chips, but... it was yummy.The bahn mi (official name: Sunny Side Beef) was pretty awesome. While the mix of textures in the sandwich was right--a little bit crunchy in the form of sweet potato fries with the meat and egg--I mostly remember the meat having this remarkable sweet/soy flavor. And there was a lot of it!I didn't even mind the presence of jalapenos. They were crispy and not too hot to distract from the excellent flavor of the sandwich.It's hard to take the time to savor something this good, but you should definitely try. They remind me of meat skewers my parents used to make, that have been tenderized in 7-Up. In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if that was part of the recipe."
"Lotus Cafe & Bánh Mì Sandwiches is a wonderful spot that I would recommend to anyone. The spring rolls are good, the Bánh Mì are wonderful, and they have the best chicken wings I have eaten in Chicago. One more time for effect, ""they have the best chicken wings I have eaten in Chicago""!"
"Popped in here for a quick lunch while in town and the sandwiches were delicious. We both had the sunnyside beef, which was jam packed with beef, daikon, cilantro, carrot, jalapeños, and an egg. The vietnamese coffee was strong and the service was friendly. Our only complaint was that the eggs were overcooked. We were definitely looking forward to some oozing egg yolk!"
"I have been meaning to try out Lotus Cafe banh mi since reading such glowing reviews on yelp. Went here on a rainy Saturday afternoon for lunch. Hubby ordered the veggiecado and I got the ginger chicken banh mi. The place is small - but bright and clean. The sandwiches are quite big and all of them come with jalapenos, pickled radish, mayo and cilantro. Loved both the sandwiches. Ginger chicken banh mi was super flavorful and the fresh toppings just make the sandwich special. They put lots of fresh cilantro, just like I like it. Will definitely be back when we are in the neighborhood. I want to try the pho that everyone is raving about."
The sandwiches are quite delicious although I do find them a little bland at times - they all seem to rely on onions and sauce for the complexity instead of maybe some heat or herbs. The spring rolls need traditional herbs as they are too boring. The coffee is great. It's a very nice option for lunch in the area for sure and much better than those chain sandwich shops by a mile.
"The banh mi was so good.So I'm currently on a two month American road trip, and I've been trying banh mi sandwiches where I can. I'm also Vietnamese and have had my fair share of Vietnamese food. I love that this place combined traditional elements of the banh mi (perfect flakey bread, pickled veggies were well pickled, cilantro, etc.) yet, the meat was grilled, so flavourful, and not sketchy at all, like you can make out what it was. If you've ever had traditional banh mi, you'd know what I mean. I had the pork banh mi, my boyfriend had the grilled honey pork banh mi, and we shared the soy glazed wings. We both agreed it was one of the best banh mi's we've had so far.Definitely recommend, I want to go back and order everything else so I can try it all."
"I've never had Banh Mi before but I'm happy to have experienced here! The food was so good, I had the Sunnyside Beef and tried the Ginger Chicken. Both have great marinated meat with fresh toppings. We also tried the soy glazed marinated wings (medium) which were spicy, sweet, and delightfully crunchy. I would definitely come here again and more bring friends!!"
"I got food from here several times (take out and deluvery) and I finally had the chance to write review.The place is small, but it's clean and cozy. Their delivery service is also fast. I tried several items from their menu, from the spring  rolls to their noodle salad.Their spring roll is decent. 3 large shrimp rolls (they cut it half, so I get 6 rolls) for $6-ish. Taste just like any other spring rolls you get from other place. I love their noodle salads. Tried their chicken something, it was good. Last time, my husband brought the rib eye pinapple, which was yummy.Their banh mi is also good. My husband favorite is the sunny side beef. He also loves their wings. The sauce is addictive. Lol!The price is actually decent if you compare it to Joyyee's banh mi.Will definitely go back here again. Next time I will try their drinks too."
"This is hands down the best banh mi place within walking range of the UIC campus, and perhaps one of my favorites in general. While not strictly traditional, if you enjoy a slightly different take on a typical banh mi, I implore you to make the trip and try one. My ordering preference, at least over the course of this past winter, has been the honey-glazed pork, and a hot Vietnamese coffee, both excellently prepared and more than satisfactory. The service is excellent and quick, even when they're dealing with a lunch rush. The prices are even reasonable for both quality and quantity of food!The only complaint that I might have is that they're not open early enough for me to have a coffee and sandwich for breakfast, but I'm not counting it against them, as I'd imagine I'm an anomaly when it comes to having this for breakfast."
I love Banh Mi Sandwiches! So found this small cozy cafe on Yelp and it is worth the 4.5 stars it displays. It is very clean and offers fast and friendly service. We tried the beef sunny side and the chicken Bahn Mi. Both were prepared with fresh ingredients and were delicious.If you love Banh Mi - this should be your go to place!!
"Lotus Cafe & Banh Mi is easily my favorite spot in the University Village area.The banh mis here are fantastic. I've tried the Belly Classic, Honey Grilled Pork (my favorite), and Sunny Side Beef, and all three are great. The bread, meats and veggies are all very fresh, and go great with just a splash of sauce for a little extra tanginess. At under $7 a sandwich, you really can't beat the price either. Likewise, the spring rolls are fresh as well, and portions are generous.Smoothies are fresh and delicious as well, and you can ask them to blend different flavors. They also serve an iced jasmine milk tea that's pretty amazing, although a little sweet. The fridge also has a great selection of hard-to-find sodas.The cafe is unassuming and pretty small, but the interior is welcoming and the staff is cheerful.  They deliver as well, and pretty quickly.As much as I love this place, there are three things that I wish were different about it:1. There's a couple menu items that unfortunately are no longer available. The cafe used to serve a pretty decent Pho on the weekends, as well as a cherimoya-flavored smoothie. Very unfortunate that they decided not to stick with these items!2. On one of my visits, there were some gnats buzzing around the bottles of sauce near the entrance. Fortunately this was just a one time occurrence, and you really can't blame the gnats too much for wanting some of the deliciously tangy sauces here, but the owners here should try to make sure that the sauce tray is well cleaned.3. This place closes at 8pm. Alas, no late night bahn mi delivery!"
"Okay, this was every bit as delicious as it was hyped up to be! Sunny side beef, if you're reading this, I can't wait to hold you in my hands again. I had the pork belly classic and honey grilled pork but you, my friend, really stood out from the rest. Your perfectly toasted roll, savory beef, fried egg and everything else in between was amazing and bursting with flavor. I. WANT. YOU.Oh, but let us not forget about the soy glazed wings..reminiscent of Korean fried wings he was your PERFECT sidekick."
"I was driving in the neighborhood and not one to pass up on Vietnamese entered the place  and asked for Chicken Pho, the guy in the counter was perplexed and amused  as to why anyone would want that soup on an 80 degree day :) he told me that is a winter special and i ordered the tofu spring rolls to go. They had a bitter after taste maybe because of the sesame oil, more rice noodles than the tofu which i prefer. Will go back in the winter to try the PHO."
"Super friendly service and clean atmosphere.  The food is delicious.  Went here a couple of times, and had the spring rolls and the sunny side beef banh mi.  Soo good!My usual nowadays is #1 Belly sandwich.Thai iced tea is on the stronger side which is what I like."
"Got two sandwiches,  I think being in LA and the bahn mi explosion over past few years what is in the menu here is nothing new. They could use a little more balance with sour ands spice,  the bread hid the flavor. Got thai coffee,  was not real thai coffee. Treated like a sweet iced coffee from Starbucks. Hot milk tea was ok, still bit too sweet."
"If you want a quick, flavor-packed meal, this is an excellent choice. I ordered the Veggiecado Banh Mi, and it was delicious! Washed it down with a sweet Thai Iced Tea--an excellent meal, all around, with excellent service to boot. There's seating inside, enough for a small group to dine in, but you can also get your order to go. If the weather had been more inclement, it'd be a great bite to take and enjoy on a stroll around the University Village area; but, alas, it was January. Regardless, I really enjoyed my lunch and definitely plan to return for another sandwich soon!"
"I love this place! Let alone being the only clean place around UIC that also offers great food at a reasonable price, Lotus is definitely a go-to place for me to have a Bahn Mi sandwich. I love the extra meet option!"
"One of the bestest places to go for fast and good eats!  In short, this is a fantastic place for unique banh mi sandwiches (a type of Vietnamese sandwich) with a unique twist. I have yet to find a location that sells banh mi like this (with fresh ingredients to boot!)For those visiting for the first time, I highly recommend the Honey Grilled Pork and Sunnyside Beef banh mi sandwiches (my boyfriend and I usually order both and share)... I've also tried the ginger chicken, but I felt this was a little drier for my taste.Both the garden and shrimp spring rolls are yummy, although the shrimp spring rolls win in my book. The sauce that it comes with is delish (!!), although the quality of the rolls themselves sometimes can be hit or miss, with the skin being slightly dry at some visits. They are modified to appeal to less venturous taste buds and do not have the traditional minty leaves that you'll find in Argyle shrimp spring rolls (which are generally fresher from my experience).The soy glazed wings are also yummy- again, sometimes a little dry (lacking sauce), but overall a great dish I'd recommend trying, which some may recognize as Korean fried chicken wings you may find at other locations.Recently added to their menu is their pho :) .. It's a standard pho dish (no option to order a tripe only, meatball only, etc. currently), with the standard side dish of bean sprouts and sauces, and although there was a lemon instead of a lime, the flavor of the lemon complemented quite nicely with the broth. The broth was slightly tangier at baseline and the noodles weren't as smooth compared to Argyle pho, but it definitely stands as the best pho in the area and will satisfy those seeking a quick fix who can't make the trip further out.. It's definitely worth a try!All of their drinks my boyfriend and I've had are winners :) .. The coffee is sweet and light- just right!Of note, they no longer use LevelUp. There is a location for people to park and use their hazard lights for a quick pick up, and free parking in certain areas on Union or Halsted if you're lucky... otherwise, you can use the parking garage or parking meters [Parking garage will likely be cheaper as long as you aren't staying too long].If you are seeking to satisfy your taste buds for more authentic pho or spring rolls, you may want to consider a trip to Argyle.. But for those seeking a restaurant in the area, Lotus definitely stands as a a fantastic go-to for quick and yummy Asian eats with their delicious banh mi with a special twist- you won't find another place quite like it :)!"
"Loving the warm smiles from the staff, the generous portions of spring rolls, and the chill outdoor seating with my dog. Thxo!"
"Good Banh Mi sandwiches but over priced compared to others.  That would be my only complaint and reason of the rating.  There isn't anything really special about the sandwiches and since I haven't tried any of their other items, I can only go by the Banh Mi.  Good location with various restaurants and shopping."
"We rarely get delivery to my office, but one day I was craving a bahi mi and everyone else jumped on board!  I have had the tofu and the chicken, and both are amazing!I love love love this place!"
"Did not know they served wings here.Went in with a friend and she turned me on to them.They are packed full of flavor and perfectly cooked.They are sweet, tangy, and spicy. The heat is slow and hits you towards your 4th wing and lasts a little bit after you finish your meal.They are still fast with their service without losing quality."
"I'd normally be apoplectic about paying $6 for a banh mi, but after my first Chicago banh mi experience was bitter, expensive disappointment at Saigon Sisters, I'll take Lotus Cafe's ""discount."" (Call me when Chicago imports a $3 banh mi joint from Houston.)On top of that, Lotus Cafe's banh mi was better. I've now had the sunny side beef bah mi twice, and I do recommend it. I particularly love how the yolk bursts and soaks into the bread. The French bread is very solid, the beef is tasty, and the veggies are on par.The minuses are the price, as I still can't quite wrap my head around Chicago Vietnamese prices, and the fact that they used half-and-half instead of condensed milk when making my coffee. But given the (argh) relatively cheap price and favorable proximity, this is, I suppose, my go to banh mi spot now."
"Loved the sunny side beef so much!! Great little shop, clean modern decor. The location is convenient around the UIC campus with street parking."
"God I love this place. Something tells me their fried tofu isn't the most healthy thing, but damn.. what a deal. A delicious sandwich for 6-7 bucks.Super nice people. Fast service. Really one of my favorite places for lunch."
"I have had this place bookmarked for quite some time now and finally was able to make it here.  It's a cute and bright little restaurant tucked away on Maxwell in University Village that makes some seriously good Banh Mi sandwiches.  They have a photo menu behind/above the cash registers so you can see the sandwiches in all their glory.All of the sandwiches looked delicious but I ended up trying the Honey Grilled Pork Banh Mi, and it was really good.  It wasn't quite as big/stuffed as I am used to with Banh Mi sandwiches, but again still very tasty.  At $5.45 per sandwich it's a great price for quality food in this particular area.I can't wait to try all the other sandwiches too!"
I went here with my friends to try the banh mi sandwiches since banh mi is so popular. This place is located in the heart of university of village. I had the shrimp spring rolls and the sunny side beef banh mi and it was delicious. It's not a big place but good enough size to sit in for dining or you can do carry out. I have to go back to this place and try the pork belly banh mi.
"This place is my regular mid-work sandwich joint.The Sunnyside Beef and Honey Grilled Pork are made to perfection!! Tasty, nicely blended flavors that go so well with the subtly crisp bread. And a Litchi smoothie to die for.. Good options with the smoothies and they even let you mix and match flavors according to your tastes (yes, for free). ;)The staff is friendly, service is quick and although I normally order takeout, the place is very ambient and student friendly. Do NOT miss this place if you're ever around the University Village. :)"
"My new favorite place for banh mi sandwiches! The food was phenomenal. My boyfriend and I had the sunny-side beef banh mi sandwich, soy glazed wings, and shrimp springrolls. The sunny-side beef is packed with lots of delightful, savory flavors; the wings are made to absolute perfection; and I especially enjoyed the pineapple peanut dipping sauce that came with the shrimp springrolls. You can definitely see and taste the quality and thought that goes into everything they make here. My boyfriend and I are already planning on coming back soon and trying out the rest of what they have to offer. Additional PRO: they're located right next to a parking garage - $2 for 2.5hrs! After we ate, we walked around and checked out other local establishments in University Village."
I've come here so many times that the menu is always on the back of my mind. Love the vietnamese spring rolls here and the veggicado banh mi sandwich. Amazing!!!  The decor is cool and different. Very nice and clean. They also serve bubba tea here so that's always my dessert/sweet option. This place is inexpensive which is why I always come here and the food is delicious. Must try place if you are near UIC
"So, so, so good!  Light, filling, and fresh to def!"
"Wowsers! Would have never expected such an amazing banh mi sando on the doorstep of UIC's campus. Uptown yeah, but not this hood. Those Flames freaking lucked out cause not only is banh me extremely inexpensive, but Lotus is about the best I've had since moving back to Chicago. Ginger chicken was out of this world and the shrimp spring rolls we're really tasty too. It's a small spot with limited space, but for a cheap awesome lunch it's almost impossible to beat."
"Great banh mi sandwiches.  The spring rolls are pretty good, definitely overpriced.  I also like the sauces they have."
"Exceptional place. Far better than its competitors, Lotus offers the best Bahn Mi sandwiches you can find south of Uptown. The sandwiches come in over 8 different selections, all under 8 dollars, freshly prepared on the spot without taking too much time. Their bread is baked to perfection. Its soft, crunchy texture is only matched by it's  glimmering golden color. Their meats and veggies are consistently fresh and rich in flavor. And your caffeine-deprived brain will thank you for their Vietnamese coffee - it opens the gates to a joyful, sublime experience.  Lotus' great customer experience is reflected by its courteous, polite and outgoing staff. They will always offer you suggestions and explain their ingredients. To top it off, Lotus has tables outside to relax and eat your Bahn Mi while you soak in the sun."
Stopped in since I've read so many great reviews on Yelp and I also had a hankering for a banh mi. I could see potential here. The food was overly salty from the grilled beef pineapples to chicken wings. The wings did have the perfect crisp to it. You could definitely taste the freshness of the frying oil. The sauce was good but only had a couple due to its saltiness. I also had the pork belly sandwich. It was not a typical pork belly sandwich. The meat seemed dry and jerky with a minuscule about of fat than your authentic porkbelly cha sandwich. I'll try it again.  Hopefully it's different next time and it was just a bad day. The peanut sauce for the spring rolls tasted old. Disappointed by the rave reviews. It feels like local people or friends supporting the owners business which I can understand.
"I ordered for delivery.  I hate it when places bake in tons of extra time.  Let's me honest; it doesn't take much to have a spreadsheet and track how long it takes from order time to delivery time for a week, month, etc. and then add an extra 5 minutes for a cushion.  But when I order at 7:07 and the delivery time estimates at 8:24, that seems a bit ridiculous considering I'm 2 miles away.  Thankfully it arrived at 7:40 so I really do not know why an extra 45 minutes needed to be cushioned in there.  Nonetheless the delivery was pretty quick.  I would be giving 4 stars but they completely messed up my order.  I'd give 2 stars but the things we got were so tasty.  So you can see my predicament.  I ordered the beef and mushroom Bahn Mi.  This was supposed to have Sauteed king mushroom, lemongrass, pickled daikon and carrots, cucumber, cilantro and jalapenos.  That is not what I got.  There was no beef and no jalapenos.  How do you have a Bahn Mi without jalapenos?  I did get the daikon and carrot but also got grilled onions.  The only sandwich I can find on their menu with grilled onions is the sunnyside up beef, which is definitely not what I got.  So I got some ingredients left off and some added.  The mushrooms and veggies were good as was the bread.  My husband got the original, which was very tasty.  This was no Acadia but a very tasty Bahn Mi.  I will try again and hope they get my order right next time!"
"It's a little more pricey than some of the spots on the Northside but the quality is great and the size of the sandwich is slightly larger.Staff is friendly, the place is spotless and they have some interesting options."
"I've been in living in Vietnam for a little over a month now.And I can honestly say that Lotus Cafe is still the best banh mi I've tried.Honestly, you cant get better than this."
"I'm so glad to have found a baguette/banh mi place down in the more southern part of Chicago! Great meal to fill you up fast, especially when if you're in a hurry. The banh mi is delicious! I got the Belly Pork Banh Mi. The meat was exactly what I was looking for. I also got the vermicelli, which was also very flavorful. I saved a banh mi in the fridge overnight, but it was still tasty and the bread was still crunchy.My only complaint...well, my roommate's complaint is that the Vietnamese coffee wasn't as authentic as she wanted. The restaurant has a hipster kind of vibe, in my opinion which is nice."
"A super solid option for a grubhub delivery dinner. High quality, flavorful and great prices.My sunny-side beef banh mi was full of lovely flavors and the texture of the bread and all of the ingredients was completely satisfying."
"This restaurant was clean, friendly, reasonably price, and good parking. The food was great"
"This is ideal for UIC students, as it is right by Maxwell and Halsted. All in all, it is quick, convenient, reasonably priced, and the banh mi is tasty.Seriously, the way they prepare their meats is special compared to other banh mi places, where it is normally not the main attraction. I recommend the belly classic and the ginger chicken. There are also vegetarian options for those who avert meat.Though their menu may appear short, they do cover quite a bit of ground with it. In terms of appetizers, you have 2 types of spring rolls, an egg roll and wings! The main menu also includes noodles salads and they provide an array of beverages which I am willing to try on my next escapade here.  Cheers"
"Great Banh Mi and bubble tea! We had the pork belly and the lemongrass pork banh mi, both are great :)"
The Sunnyside Beef was amazing!  Awesome Spring Rolls!!  If you are searching for great tasting Banh Mi this is a must!  I normally go to Ba Le in Viet town but I think the Sunnyside Beef banh mi is worth a trip to a different area of the city!
Good stuff.  I came here on a Summer day & again in a late Fall afternoon/evening.  Both times the place was somewhat quiet so the food was prepared quickly.  The ingredients were fresh.  This was the second place I had a Banh Mi & I think I preferred this one to the one I was served in the Asian-American Neighborhood near Bridgeport.  The portions aren't huge so you could potentially finish your portions there (no left overs).  The people that hung out there kind of remind me of the Starbuck's loungers; I think that's self explanatory  ; )
"This place has the freshest food!  I loved their shrimp springrolls.  The peanut dipping sauce that came with them was awesome.  The Sunnyside Beef was soooo delicious.  I keep thinking about this place, and I can't wait to go back!  I wish this place were closer to me."
We always call ahead for take out... Sunnyside beef sandwich and the ginger chicken cabbage salad are our standard order.  It's not a destination but we need this place in the neighborhood.
Favorite sandwich place in the city. My wife and I come here all the time. Quick and informal with outdoor summer seating. Other than the sandwiches I love their super hot wings and smoothies.
Food quality is good but quantity of meat on their dishes and sandwiches is low I had a chicken ginger sandwich and felt like it was a veggie sandwich.  The glazed wings are definitely a must ....this place is not good for children and thay have no high chairs
"I wasn't blown away the first time I came here  about a year ago. My grilled pork wasn't really tender like you want it, and I left confused about the 4.5 yelp rating. This week, I was going to give it another chance (I like pork) but asked the cashier for a rec, and she said sunny side up beef is her favorite. I took her up on it and I have to confirm all the other reviews and say it is amazing. Do it!! I thought the added egg might make it feel too heavy, but it didn't, and the beef was really good. The only sad part was after taking it back home, some of the bread got soggy. I guess you could think of it as a french dip and be ok with it. I also wish it was cheaper (~$7 feels steep when I think about ~$4 banh mis in Houston or possibly on Argyle) but I'll definitely go back and pay for it."
"Generally, the food here is really good, though I do have a few suggestions. But first, the review:Veggiecado: Delicious! The bread is crusty on the outside and soft in the inside, slightly marinated by the pickled daikon lining the bottom. The tofu bits on top give a good earthy and hearty flavor to the sandwich, and the rest of the veggies are fresh and crunchy. It tastes even better with a bit of the peanut sauce poured on top.Shrimp Spring Rolls: These are normally quite good, though I think the peanut sauce is a tad too sweet. Still, they're a must-order for me and with whoever I'm dining. The last time I had these delivered though, they left out the daikon, cucumber, and shallots. It was only lettuce, noodles, and shrimp. :(Rib-eye Pineapple Noodle Salad: This is great! The combination of all ingredients, making this dish salty and savory (with a spicy kick, thank you jalapeños), makes it a must-order.Suggestions: Perhaps a serving of sriracha with delivery orders & making the peanut sauce a little less sweet (without sacrificing the pineapple taste)Cheers to a great meal!"
Go! The bahn mi sandwiches are just fantastic. Also make sure you try BOTH the belly classic and the sunny side beef. Every part of the sandwich is well thought out and fresh to give you the most authentic and refreshing taste possible. Also the price is great for local students and makes for a fantastic lunch option. Definitely worth a try at the very least.
"I am new to the area and I was excited to see a place like Lotus was in the neighborhood. My first impression was that the place was clean, inviting, and a great decor. The staff was very kind and helpful if you are not familiar with the cuisine. I decided to go with the sunny side beef and it was amazing. The beef, egg, spice , and other flavors was a perfect combination. I can't wait to try the rest of their stuff!!!"
"What a pleasant surprise in the heart of the UIC campus.  This place gets high marks for excellent sandwiches, friendly staff, and reasonable prices.  The cafe itself is decorated well, and the vibe inside is comfortable and casual. We got the Honey Grilled Pork banh mi and the Sunny-Side Beef banh mi, both of which were amazing.  Each had excellent flavors and great textural components in the crunchy bread and fresh vegetables.  We also tried the Soy Glazed Wings (6).  If you get them spicy, be prepared for the fire alarm to go off in your mouth - wow!  Like the sandwiches, these wings had a nice combination of flavor and texture.  My sister also picked up a mango smoothie.  It was refreshing and did well to subdue that scorching sensation in your mouth from the spicy wings! I was a little hesitant to try this place out since what I had in mind that evening was a hole in the wall Vietnamese joint on Broadway / Argyle, but Lotus was close by and we heard some good things about it so we decided to check it out.  We're certainly glad we did!"
"Delicious!!!! I had the vegicado bahn mi and it was amazing!!! Fresh avocado and tomatoes to top off crispy sweet potatoes abs fried tofu. Garnished with cilantro, vegetable slaw and pickled cucumbers. Topped with siracha!!!! This sandwich has it all!! Tangy tart and spicy, a crunchy bite of texture and soft fresh bread. Can not go wrong with anything on this menu, I am absolutely sure of it!!! Trust me you will not be disappointed at all!"
"My sister in law and I came here for a quick bite to eat before the bruno mars concert at the United Center. She ordered a Honey Grilled Pork and Shrimp Springrolls. I ordered the Belly Classic banh mi and the soy glazed wings. Sister in law said that the honey grilled pork was good, my belly classic was delicious (especially with extra jalapenos). My mouth is drooling just thinking about my meal. The daikon/carrot blend was seasoned perfectly and had such a great crisp to them. The bread was crusty and soft inside. Shrimp springrolls were pretty simple actually but it had quality ingredients that made the dish perfect. The lettuce that surrounded the noodles were so crisp that it totally made the whole roll that much better. My soy glazed wings (hot) had a fantastic kick and was seasoned and cooked perfectly. I can't wait to come back, this place was absolutely great."
"This place is overrated! I ordered deliver and it took almost 2 hours to show up! As you can imagine, all the food was cold! The more disappointing part was the quality of the food! There was literally only a single piece of pork on my sandwich!  I wouldn't bother ordering from here!"
"Came here for lunch on the weekend a little while ago and I had the Mushroom Lemongrass (veggie), and it was pretty delicious. Since I'm a huge mushroom lover, this was an obvious first choice for me. They also used king mushrooms! Extra plus. The portion size was pretty generous, especially with the shrooms. It's order and sit, and the young man was nice and friendly. They also have a little outdoor seating area, which where my cousin and I sat. I'd definitely go back and try the other veggie banh mi sandwich aka Veggiecado.Only negative is their hours, just gotta catch them when they are open!"
"Since Ba Le has pulled up stakes this seems like the only place for Banh Mi in the area. My friend and I trekked up from his place to pick up a couple sandwiches for ourselves and his family. I ended up getting two of the sunnyside beef sandwiches and you know, it was pretty good. I wish the egg was a little runnier but otherwise a decent banh mi. The spring rolls were plentiful and since my friend's wife is a sharer I got to sample one, also a decent roll. If you live in the area go and support them since it's bringing more options to the UIC area. Otherwise, I wouldn't go too, too far out of the way for their sandwiches."
I'm addicted to the Belly Classic with extra jalapeños. I always leave thinking about the next time I'll be back.
"So I've been here around 10 times since it opened. I really would like to try more of the items on the menu but I keep going back to my favorites: the sunnyside beef and shrimp spring rolls (one day I will try you, garden spring rolls...one day). This is my favorite place to get shrimp spring rolls because not only are they delicious but you get a lot for what you paid for. I really appreciated Lotus after going to a Vietnamese place in Chinatown where they basically give you a sliver of shrimp in your spring roll (seriously). The only thing that makes me sad is when they are closed and I can't get my fix!"
"Good value for $.  Subtle but distinct ethnic flavors.Rib-eye Pineapple Noodle Salad ($6.95, shareable) -- you need knife for this to cut through rice noodles.  Tender slightly sweet marinated rib-eye stir fry with onions, pineapple and thin slices of jalapeño with sprinkles of fried onions over room temp rice noodles.  Contemporary dish that takes you to the pacific islands without forgetting the Vietnamese culture.Served with a side of papaya salad over slightly bitter greens.  Bitterness restarts the palate away from sweet and spicy taste.Classic Hot Coffee -- traditional Vietnamese coffee served on a 12 oz frothed milk.  Mellow taste.Cashier/Server is sharp!  Knowledgeable about the 10 dish menu.  Friendly.  Practical to read name from credit card instead of asking you your name.Good seating arrangement without feeling cramp.  Clean.  Orderly."
I was spoiled with great Bahn Mi in sandwiches in NYC and in San Francisco.  Chicago finally has a decent Bahn Mi.  This is a hidden gem at UIC.
"lately, i have been taking culinary forays into Chicago from Portage Indiana via the South Shore train.  My goal is to find a couple restaurants that make it worth while my four hours of transit time to and from Chicago specifically, for an outstanding gastronomic experience.  i don't consider my-self a foody but i do enjoy it enough to consider this feasible.  Unfortunately, Lotus cafe does not make the cut.  It was interesting and decent but honestly I could easily make much better spring roles at home and I am not the Hells Kitchen type of guy.  I am quite surprised this place has such high ratings.  Don't get me wrong I would eat here everyday if i lived on the block."
"Delious little hole in the wall resturant, had the sunny side beef sanwich and the mushroom and lemon grass sandwich, also got a taro smoothie. The sandwiches were nice and big ( bigger than any other bah mi sandwich i have had). The smoothie was nice and smooth and filled to the top just as good, kaybe even better than joy yee's smoothies"
"one of my friends recommended this place to me.. so i decided to give it a shot.. parking around the area is a pain in the a. but i managed to find one at night..i ordered a sunny side beef banh mi, honey grilled pork banh mi, and soy glazed wings hot..sunny side beef and the honey grilled pork banh mi was both filled with flavors and it tasted fresh.. the banh mi was pretty balance unlike other places where its too much veggies and not enough of meat .. these i can taste the bread, veggies, and meat equally which i like..jumbo soy glazed wings.. nothing jumbo about these wings lol.. the wings is pretty decent but its over flavored.. and for me i don't think its worth it for the price.. but that's just me.."
"I think I should update this review since I go here almost every week.  Basically I've tried almost everything on the menu since my last review, and I can say with no exaggeration that I have liked EVERYTHING.  My favorite banh mi's are the Belly Classic, Ginger Chicken, and the Veggiecado (but really, all of them are delicious).   Their spring rolls (both shrimp and tofu) are fresh and flavorful, especially with the dipping sauce.  They really don't skimp on ingredients either!  The sandwiches, salads, and spring rolls are STUFFED on the inside!  Another one of my favorites is the grilled pork vermicelli noodle salad.  Their soy glazed wings are also delicious if you're in a lo-carb mood.  Lastly, I LOVE their house coffee!  It's sweet, but you can always get it lightly sweetened if you're used to drinking your coffee black.Basically, this is the BEST banh mi sandwiches (and more) in Chicago, and probably the entire midwest.  As a chick who grew up near the OC where Little Saigon is located, I think I can vouch for it's authenticity and awesomeness."
One of the better spring rolls I've had but not the best sandwich yet (both vegetarian).
"I ordered ginger chicken cabbage salad. It was so good. Simple composition but complex tastes. There were BBQ chicken, fish chips, cilantro, jalapeños, cabbage, and possibly fish sauce. When I first saw the cabbage, I thought it was going to be so raw to the point that I'll feel like I'm eating grass. But surprisingly, the cabbage tastes sweet especially with the addition of fish sauce. Chicken was very tender and flavorful. The portion size was quite descent/big and I was full by the end. I'm coming back."
"I've been meaning to come by here, but it's so hard to get to in University Village that I've been putting it off.I got the sunnyside beef and a strawberry mango smoothie. So so good. I've only ever had a bahn mi one other time, so I'm not going to pretend like I'm an expert. I wasn't sure of the flavor profiles, but it was scrumptious. The only (small) complaint I have is that there could be more meat in the sandwich. About half of my bites had no meat in it. Not sure if this is the norm or if it was just mine. The smoothie was perfect - not syrupy.This place had no one in it at dinner time, and I'm sure it's because of the location. Put this in the Loop and it would be packed."
"I've Yelp-stalked this place for a while now and last week I finally got a chance to go and eat here. I've read through some of the 5 star reviews and, ummm, this place seriously lives up to all of the 5 star ratings!I ordered the sunny side beef banh mi and hooooooly shit, this is seriously my new favorite sandwich. All of the flavors were so perfect. Sauteed beef, caramelized onions, cucumbers, jalapenos, cilantro, sunny side egg, sweet potato crispys, and some kind of sauce. What is not to love here?? I seriously dream of this banh mi deliciousness. I also had a strawberry mango smoothie which was amazing. I'm pretty excited to try the rest of their menu!"
"This place gets 5 stars and deserves every single one of them. I rarely give them, so this place is a winner.I was a bit hesitant to try this place. It was empty inside and I tried it on a whim- It just felt like a Vietnamese sandwich kind of afternoon.. I didn't even need yelp to direct me through the doors. It was by some divine power leading me to this place.Anyhow, the classic was spot on. The bread was soft and perfect. The meat tasted fresh. I even had stray cilantro peeking from my bun- just the way I remember them from the Vietnamese sandwiches I've purchased from what I consider my hometown and the Saigon outside of Vietnam, aka San Jose, CA.You can't go wrong grabbing a sandwich here. My only gripe is paying the extra $3-4 for a sandwich that I normally would buy for $2.50 in CA.  But this is Chicago, so it's not a deal breaker."
"Very good food! It is different, but good. Only downside is that it is kind of pricey."
"I love this place!I always go out of my way and stop by here for a sandwich or two. Thank goodness for standing 15 minute parking on the same block so that I don't have to pay for parking!My favourite dishes will have to be the Sunny Side Beef Banh Mi and the Shrimp Spring Rolls! You can definitely taste the freshness in the ingredients. You can see the Sunny Side Beef ingredients in other reviews - let me tell you, YOU HAVE TO TRY IT! The spring rolls come with vermicelli noodles, some fresh greens, and some shrimp in some savoury peanut sauce. It is very refreshing!As said in other review, the thai Iced tea is really good too! Not too sweet - just right!If I lived closer, I'd definitely be a weekly regular. I guess I'll just have to settle for having them programed into my phone for much needed phone in orders whenever I'm in the area."
"Just what this area needs, but it is an unfortunate location.  If you don't know it's there, you'd probably never just happen to stumble upon it.This restaurant which opened in September is run by a husband and wife who happen to be UIC grads; great story for the campus community. The menu is small, concise and has something for everyone. The pork belly classic is so amazing with it's warm, crusty bread, perfectly cooked pork belly and array of fresh and pickled veggies. So much flavor packed into this sandwich. Everything on the menu is very fairly priced. There are even vegan and vegetarian options. The upscale beverage and smoothie selections are a nice accompaniment to the tasty sandwiches. I will definitely be back because there are so many different bahn mis and appetizers I want to try."
"OMG. Yum. Food is great, fresh and quick! I wish I lived/worked nearby so I could eat there more often. They have vegan/vegetarian options AND Thai coconut water. The spring rolls are delightful and filling.My only complaint? Even if you eat there, it's all served in carry-out material, so lots of plastic waste. And there's no recycling."
"Sigh.  Since my last review I've brought many of my friends here, who love it, and I've tried almost all the food items.  My sandwich order: Sunnyside beef (can't beat the fried egg and crunchy sweet potatoes), vegan lemongrass beef (surprisingly wonderful), honeygrilled pork, belly classic (thicker-than-usual but still thinly cut pork belly and other meats; I really like this one), ginger chicken (my bf disagrees and i know many people very dedicated to the ginger chicken), veggiecado.  They're all great sandwiches.The shrimp springrolls have lettuce, vermicelli, and shrimp in them.  A bit of a disappointment: I was hoping for an interesting twist like the sandwiches, or at least something as interesting as the traditional (mint, basil?  bean sprouts?  cucumbers?  anything besides lettuce?)Someone complained that they don't have drinks but that's not true, there are lots of smoothies, coffee, tea, and stuff in the fridge.  It would be pretty great if they offered small dessert items (mmm che....)So all the food is great.  A few days ago they lost my order of three items for half an hour (I understand that this happens; I used to work in fast food too) and I was real upset/hungry, so they gave me a 20% next order coupon.  So that's worth $1.50 for my sandwich today.  Grumble grumble.  But the food is so good and this is just one time!"
"As a vegetarian, I find myself ordering the same dishes over and over - the veggiecado and the garden spring rolls - and yet, I find myself coming back over and over. The ingredients are fresh, the food is delicious and affordable, and the atmosphere is bright and welcoming. I wish I'd had a place like this as a student. Actually, I wish I'd had Lotus as a student.Everyone I've taken here has found something to their liking. You should stop in."
"A little pricier than I'm used to for Bahn Mi (I live right near Argyle), but so clean and bright, I'm willing to pay a few bucks more. I haven't had anything I didn't like- Honey grilled pork is great but I've tried most of the others and been happy with them too. The Spring rolls are good too!  Lots of beverage options including smoothies- great spot for lunch!"
Honey BBQ Pork is so good!I give it four stars because sometimes its a miss and not a hit.Get extra mayo on the side. You wont find that anywhere else
"This place was around the corner from my former hair salon... too bad its not closer to my house! That's my only complaint. This place is perfect if you want something different for lunch; I've never had anything like it. I had the Honey Grilled Pork sandwich with cucumbers. So delicious! It is so light, so flavorful, and has a bit of spice. I will definitely return in the future if I'm in the area."
"My gf came here with her friends while I was stuck in clinical and surprised me with a Sunny-side Beef sandwich. It was so good even a few hours later! Actually, it was so good that we came back here and ate it fresh a few days later. The bread isn't too hard like other places and the meat is filled with flavors. The egg is just the icing. Nice small hidden place by my house, so I will definitely be coming back here again!"
"Great Vietnamese sandwiches for a low low price! They have traditional toppings, but the standout is probably the sunny side up beef which is an egg over beef all inside a perfectly toasted, warm, crunchy on outside, soft on the inside bun. Stands up well against the places on Argyle or anywhere else in the city!"
"I have only had a Banh Mi sandwich once before so by no means am I an expert.  But my taste buds don't lie and they liked this one MUCH better.  I went with the vegan beef and the hubby did the honey grilled pork.  The bread is amazing; fresh, light and crispy.  Both were stuffed with all kinds of different flavors and textures; fresh cilantro, spicy jalapeño peppers, crunchy cucumbers and seasoned meat (fake meat in my case but with a meaty texture).  I died and went to heaven as I dipped my sandwich in a mix of sweet chili and sriracha sauce; which only elevated the flavors inside the bun with a sweet 'n spicy kick and gave the crunchy crusted bread something to get saucy with.The restaurant atmosphere was very casual.  Quick, convenient lunch spot."
"Delicious, fresh and consistent.  Always in our take out rotation.  Thanks for the all the awesome veggie options! :)"
I now get the vegan lemongrass which is very good I think I like it betterThe veggiecado and I am a big fan of the veggiecado.
"This little sandwich shop is perfect and I'm sure it would be 100 times busier if it was just half a block west on Halsted.I learned about it on Friday and 5 days later I have been there 3 times!It's cheap (~$5 Sandwiches), and the food is clean and very very tasty.  It's also nicely decorated with some photographs and the staff has been very friendly.Definitely a place to stop by and grab some sandwiches."
"Pretty slow service at 1:00 in the afternoon on a Wednesday, but everything was fresh and delicious.  If you're getting take-out, call ahead!  The wings were right up there with the best I've ever had.  Outstanding."
"Fast service, great food, high value. If that's not hitting every nail on the head, I don't know what is. I had the Sunny-Side Beef sandwich and a smoothie. Came out to less than 12 bucks, and they brought the food outside to our table. Sandwich was damn good, the egg was hot and cooked perfect, smoothie was awesome as well (though very sweet, thats why its good!). This was my first time here, and I'll likely be back at least once a week."
"I loved eating there! Everything is very tasty and at a reasonable price. I had the beef and pork sandwich and both were delicious. The bread is fresh and all the seasonings blended in perfectly. It's in a cute little corner and is started by UIC graduates, so if you're looking for new places to try, this is definitely a must go!"
"The sandwiches here are phenomenal.  Although I'm not used to paying these prices for viet-french style sandwiches, I still must give them 5 stars as any option on their menu is nomnom fantastic.  Not a single hole on their menu."
"Fantastic and flavorful banh mi sandwiches, I only wish this was closer to my house! I ordered the Honey Grilled Pork banh mi sandwich and it had a great blend of flavors . I envy UIC students and people living in University Village who are so close to such great food!"
"The food/price ratio deserves 4 stars. It's a little too expensive for my student budget but the sandwich was delicious. Also, they have vegan options which kicks ass. The people there were nice.I took a star off because the music in the place is GARBAGE. Not the band featuring Shirley Manson and Butch Vig but meaning that every song that came on was terrible and annoying. Worse, the music was played out 3 to 5 years ago so it was old garbage.If ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" by Deep Blue Something (a little older, but it drives the point home) came on I wouldn't have been surprised. This is totally unacceptable."
"First time here and got the honey grilled pork sandwich and the jasmine milk tea, both of which were made very quickly and tasted amazing. I'll be back here all the time."
"I decided to stop by this new shop on the way home from work.  I thought it would just be another typical vietnamese sandwich (banh mi) experience, but this one was different!The sandwiches have a little unique twist to them so I decided to get 1 of each of the main four non-vegetarian.  The Honey Grilled Pork and the Sunnyside Beef are my favorite.  The egg in the Sunnyside Beef compliments the sandwich well.  The rest of the ingredients (cilantro, hot peps, picked carrots, etc) of a traditional banh mi we all know and love are also in the sandwiches and it still tastes great.The owners and workers were also very nice and friendly.  The interior decor was also very modern, it was a nice thing to observe while waiting for your food.  Have yet to taste the appetizers, but can't wait to go back and try them!"
"I work in the area and constantly stop in here for lunch.  I have yet to have anything that was less than amazing. My favorites are the shrimp spring rolls,  the Sunnyside beef,  honey grilled pork and their awesome wings.  While the portion size isn't huge, it's typically enough to fill me up. The best part is that the food is light and I feel great after eating it. Also I have nothing but great things to say about the service.  Everyone is always smiling and evenly nice.  My only concern is that it's too good and I have trouble not going they're everyday."
"UIC student & this place used to be my weekly lunch spot. I love their sunny side beef sandwich! Also, their spring rolls & wings are great."
"This place is a gem. We tried it out 'just because' -- we live in university village. We've been back already 3 times in as many weeks.  Every Banh Mi we have tried has been stellar, and the tai milk tea wonderful. Very happy to have lotus cafe nearby!!"
"Fantastic bread, beautifully crisp. The honey grilled pork was delicious, felt very fresh and healthy. Had a banana/strawberry smoothie-much better than the competition down the block (Joy Yee's) and possibly even across the street (Jamba): the smoothie felt like it wasn't made from frozen fruits.The space itself is very nice and light, and there's outdoor seating.Now I'm just annoyed that 1) I hadn't found out about this place before and 2) they appear to be closed on Sundays (yes, I was planning to return one day after trying it for the first time!)."
"This place is an absolute gem. Reasonably priced, freshly made food that amazes not just with taste but the sheer quality of it. The ginger chicken banh mi as mentioned in many other reviews here is simply scrumptious. The veggiecado was equally delicious. The thai milk tea was not overly sweet like a number of other thai places we have tried out. The added tapioca made it even better. The classic coffee stunned me (yes, it was that good!). Perfect to kickstart you on a cold dreary day. If I lived close by, I would be visiting at least once a week.The employees are smart and friendly; service is quick, the food's neatly packed, the place (and the restrooms) are reasonably clean. Thank you yelp for introducing me to such a nice place!"
The news are out. This place has one of the best sandwiches I've ever had. I used to be somewhat of a hidden gem but now it gets pretty crowded during lunch hours.
"Along every intersection in Argyle, Banh Mi's are a dime a dozen, and Chinatown even has a couple places that will make you one.But the best Bahn Mi you will have, made with fresh ingredients? That's pretty hard to come by. Everything about Lotus screams clean. The decor is inviting and the staff is friendly. And most importantly, their sandwiches are flavorful, delicious - and you can munch away with the assurance that the pâtés and pork belly hasn't been sitting out for hours.Their bread is just-right crunchy and the pickled radishes are legit  - two crucial ingredients. I am super happy this is in University Village.As word-of-mouth goes out, Lotus will see many more happy diners."
"I heard about Lotus from a fellow colleague of mine.  There has only been one banh mi place that has dominated in the Chicago area so I was pretty skeptical about Lotus.  With that said, I was very interested to try this place out.  First off, this place is located at UIC in University Village.  Lot of other tasty restaurants near by.  Parking is easy as you can park on the street or the lot right next door. Everything on the menu is good.  I've tried almost everything on the menu and haven't found anything I did not like.  The bread is awesome - so nice and crispy and flakey.  I think this is probably the best banh mi bread I've tasted in the area.  The wings are so delish.  The spring rolls are made on order fresh not like most places where they've been sitting out.  I am Vietnamese and I can say that the food is pretty much authentic with perhaps a slight modern twist.  You will not be disappointed with Lotus.  However, there is one thing that really sucks about this place: they are not open on Sunday!"
We've been obsessed with this place for the past month!  The obsession got even worse when we figured out we could have this delivered via grub hub for $1!
Finally made it here again! It's been about a years since I've eaten here and it is as good as I remember. A high bar has been set for any Bánh Mì I have in the future.
"Okay, let's just stop yapping about the relative pricing on these delicious sandwiches.  I'll keep paying a couple extra $$ for the fresh ingredients, great tastes and most of all cleanliness!  Lotus pays attention to these details so the food is the star of the show.  Simple and reasonable.  Many regulars and newbies coming through.  I'll be back for sure."
"I was so excited when I discovered that there was a banh mi place in Chicago and close to UIC. When I headed for this place, I was thinking of Lee's Sandwiches (mainly in the west coast), but these sandwiches are like a gourmet version of Lee's. They are more expensive than what I am used to, but I feel like they add more to the sandwich. I mean it has all the ingredients of banh mi like meat, pickled carrots, jalapenos, cilantro..., but something just makes it taste more gourmet. haha By the way, I'm not sure if they add pate to their sandwiches here or not. Overall, great little place to go eat. It's a simple menu. They got viet coffee. Clean and nice people work here. Sandwiches are on point."
"Taste: 5/5Location: 4/5Cleanliness: 4/5Ambience: 4/5Value for Money: 4/5 (Price, given the Food Taste)Service: 4/5This is so far the best Vietnamese Banh Mi Sandwich I've ever tried in Chicago!The decor of the restaurant is simple yet nice, and what's more important is that it's clean!They have a limited selection of dishes, but I believe, this is why all of them taste good because the owner is focused on the unique taste of each dish.I've tried the appetizers and most of the Banh Mis as well. Definitely a recommended place!"
Seriously delicious sandwiches!! I would absolutely recommend the sunny side need one. Ridiculously delicious!Also I love that they have cherimoya smoothies! This place couldn't be any more perfect.
"Nice little sandwich place with tasty Vietnamese sandwich, it was even better when it first started, there were couple times I can hardly see the meat, but lately it's been better, keep up the quality, they also has good ice coffee"
"I'm glad this place is close to me as I don't want to trek up to Argyle all the time to get banh mi. (Ba Le in Chinatown is closed forever, apparently. Correct me if I'm wrong.)I've eaten here twice and I'm already in love with a sandwich. More specifically, I'm in love with the Belly Classic. It's pork belly, what more do you want? The pork is juicy, flavorful, and has just enough fat on it to not make you hate yourself after eating it. The other offerings also sound tantalizing: Sunny-side beef, Veggiecado, Ginger chicken, Vegan lemon grass beef, and Honey grilled pork. Can't wait to come back and try out the other sandwiches."
"Move over Ba Le, there's a new king in town.So thanks to the ""near perfect"" ratings across the board, I took the trip down to UIC for lunch today and was not disappointed. Ill even go as far as saying that this is the best under $10 place I've been to in 2013! I'll even say the honey pork sandy was the best banh mi I've had, not that I'm any kind of aficionado... Place is clean and vibrant, staff are nice and the food is great. Only star lost is for having Pepsi products over Coke and no pho options if I wanted it! Check it out!"
"When you're tired of the same-old sandwiches you can get at 100 other places in the city, go here. I think I've had a misfire on the menu once, but other than that, everything is pretty original and delicious.Good stuff. We need more eats like Lotus in this area.oh, decent iced coffee too!"
"I think they have one of the best bahn mi's in the city. It's not the traditional ones I'm used, but they make a mean sandwich with the creative combination of flavors. Shrimp Spring Rolls - Solid. Not the best, but will satisfy any craving you have about spring rolls. Belly Classic - Another solid sandwich with great flavors, but they have others that I would order again before this.Sunny-side Beef - My favorite meat sandwich on their menu. The beef is tender and flavorful. It's also got a fried egg on it where the yolk breaks into the beef and covers the sandwich - what is there not to like? Veggiecado - The best veggie bahn mi I've had. It's not your standard vegan beef or chicken. It's an explosion of flavors in your mouth! I can't believe it's taken me this long to write this review, but everyone I have taken here agrees that this is one of the best bahn mi places in the city!"
No Pho. Just sandwiches. Excellent Sandwich...Friendly Service. Spring Rolls were good but above avg.. nothing stellar.
My vietnamese friend said that the sandwiches here taste better than those in Vietnam LOL. Absolutely!!
"I love this place, we go here fairly regular and every time I bite into my delicious Veggiecado Sandwich I stop and declare ""This is the BEST Sandwich ever""... There aren't a lot of good Veggie Sandwiches, often it's just a lame compromise to offer something meat free. THIS one here is delicious, filling and not expensive. Oh... my boyfriend loves the meat versions to clearly they have that down too :-)"
"Probably some of the best fast food Vietnamese I've had (including Vietnam).  The sandwiches are delicious and a bit different from Ba Le.  Both are great but there's something special about Lotus Cafe.  I don't know if it's the extra attention to detail, the ingredients, the friendly owners, or the general atmosphere but I much rather have Lotus.  Salad are also fresh and the spring rolls taste like they're rolled to order compared to prepackaged or pre-rolled(which I hate).  I really wish the best for the owners and I'm glad that people are starting to take notice.  Highly recommended.  Try it out yourself, you won't be disappointed."
"Great place for a great banh mi. Sunny side beef is awesome. Can't go wrong with this option. They are also willing to substitute chicken if you prefer not to have beef.Ginger chicken: it is good, I'm just not a fan of ginger in general.Wings: good and worth trying.Spring rolls: good and worth tryingBottom line if you don't know what to get just get the sunny side beef, it really is great!The interior of this place is very clean. Their ingredients always look and taste fresh. Of course some ppl may complain about the price, but then again we are in Chicago and you probably pay 6$ for a bland sandwich at subway, it may be bigger but the ingredients are definitely not as fresh as this place."
Love love LOVE the honey grilled pork sandwich. It was filled with meat and veggies. The bread was delicious and I highly recommend it!
"Had the sunny side beef....steak and other ingredients were fresh and tasty, I will return !"
LOVE LOVE LOVE this place.  Fresh Vietnamese sandwiches at a decent price.  Super friendly service and a cute little local spot.  Will definitely be back a few times a month and will make sure I try every sandwich on the menu.  I can see why this place has 5 stars!  I totally recommend it.
"I've been so fortunate to run into great restaurants lately!  I'm on a roll!Tried this banh mi place over the weekend tucked away down Maxwell Street and Halsted.  I live in the area so this place has caught my eye since they opened.  Didn't expect much because I'm Vietnamese and banh mi sandwiches are similar anywhere you go.  But this place is on another level.  I ordered the Soy Glazed Wings - which were kicking with flavor!!  It was sooooo good, I am drooling just writing about them now.  They let you chose your spice level and I got these bad boys, medium spicy.  I can't eat A LOT of spice but I love spicy foods!  These wings had the perfect amount of spice for me.  Crispy and flavorful - the perfect combo.  I also got the Belly Classic because what better way to judge a Banh Mi place than to try their classic sandwich?  Their Belly Classic was also really good.  They heat up your meats here before putting them into your sandwich - genius!  Overall, great small menu - it's straight to the point.  I would highly recommend anyone to get the wings if you enjoy chicken wings - a MUST!"
I love this place! I'm vegetarian so I really enjoy the garden spring rolls and pretty much get that every time. They make good smoothies too.
"I've eaten here more than 30 times now.Bahn mis are tasty but other items such as chicken wings and spring rolls are meh. I took 1 star off because lately, their bahn mis are hit or miss. Some days, the bread is crisp w/ just the right amount of fillings. Other days, bread is soggy and the compositions of fillings are bit different.**************************************************­********Sadly, this place has gone downhill since they first opened up. Belly classics taste so different with this crunch grilled vegs with gamy pate. Something definitely must have changed...Ba-bye Lotus"
"Excellent banh mi sandwiches. Tons of flavor, good selection and fast service. Springs rolls are also good side order to share with a friend and the milk tea was spot on. Check this place out if you are in the area you won't be leaving without a smile."
"I feel like I've just been re-introduced to University Village. Why hello there restaurants on Maxwell...I wouldn't have found this spot if I hadn't been actually looking for a banh mi place that was open and close to me. Prior to I've really only been to the UIC area to see my eye doctor at MarketPlace Vision and mainly walked down on Halsted. Lotus Cafe has a small inside and outside eating area. I love it as a place for down time for myself or a small group of friends. The chalkboard beam seems to welcome the college kids, but I didn't see any while I was there. This makes sense as the owners are former UIC students, and opened up this place since there isn't a Vietnamese restaurant in the area. For this foresight, and opening of this venture I am certainly appreciative. The red bottles are the siracha sauce and the yellow bottles are the chili and garlic sauce. I got the Shrimp Spring Rolls that come in 6 pieces with this really tasty pineapple peanut dipping sauce. In addition I got the Pork Belly Classic Banh Mi. This is one banh mi that I am still thinking about and salivating over. This was delicious! The price point and combination with that slight twist of what I had considered to be a classic banh mi just got upped a notch with this tasty pork belly. I also ordered the Thai Iced Tea with tapioca and I was stuffed with just eating the sandwich and the drink! Seriously, I had to eat my spring rolls the next day and they were still good. I totally want to try the soy glazed wings and one of the noodle salads next time. The service was quick and friendly. The menu is small, which I like, because it makes me think that what they make is specialized and there is a focus on making what they serve really awesome. I see only one problem, how I'm going to squash any thoughts about banh mi sandwiches and my cravings for them when I know that this is here?! I think it might be a good thing that they open at 11am and close at 8pm on Monday to Saturdays and aren't open on Sundays. I understand that I need to be cut-off at a certain point. I could easily say I want this for breakfast with a coffee or late night dinner. I have a feeling this place and I are going to become really good friends."
"Yet to eat anything here that wasn't super tasty and well prepared. Friendly staff, quick prep, I like to order on my way, it's always ready within 5-10 minutes. Thanks Lotus!"
"The Lotus Café is a small sandwich shop in the University Village neighborhood.  It serves Vietnamese-style meat and vegan specialties and sandwiches called Bánh Mì that are made with a French style baguette. On a recent visit our party of three started by sharing the Shrimp Spring Rolls.  Our main dishes consisted of the Honey Grilled Pork sandwich, the Sunnyside Beef sandwich, and the Pork House Noodle salad.  Everything was extremely well prepared, fresh and uniquely flavorful.Also, I had an Original Coffee that was delicious.  This is a café au lait made with Café Du Monde coffee and chicory (from the famous coffee shop of the same name in the French Quarter of New Orleans) and brewed in the Vietnamese way using a ""phin"" (filter). The Lotus Café serves outstanding food at extremely reasonable prices.  It simply is one of the best sandwich shops in town."
"Stopped by the Lotus Cafe because it had good yelp reviews, and I must say I was pleased with the food. I had the honey pork sandwich, and while it had some good/tangy flavors going on, it was a stronger taste than I was hoping for. My sandwich became tolerable only after I removed most of the meat from it. The sandwich itself deserves ~3stars, but I feel like I would go again to try the other options"
"In search of a delicious banh mi, I stumbled across Lotus from a friend's facebook post.  I tried the sunny-side beef and belly classic.  The french bread was super crunchy on the outside, but perfectly soft on the inside.  They did not skimp on the fillings of either sandwich.  The sunny-side beef had a healthy portion of savory, juicy steak, sliced daikon, jalapeno, cilantro, and a sunny-side up egg.  The belly classic was filled with bbq pork belly, daikon, jalapeno, and cilantro.  Both were delicious.The menu is pretty limited, and the space is very small, but the food was great.  Price point is much less than Ba Le."
Everything was good.  Sunnyside beef was the better of the two.  The Honey Grilled Pork was good but the beef and Sunnyside egg made it! Bread as so soft and fresh along with the toppings.  The wings are a great appetizer!
"This review is just for the shrimp spring rolls: lots of lettuce and noodles, one slice of cucumber, and no basil. They were also very sparse on the shrimp. Nicely made but they do not look like the pictures. They are fine in that they do not have many Vietnamese options in that area. Compared to the Vietnamese places on Argyle, this place is sub par. Its fine for what you get and what you pay for."
Best bahn mi I've had in the city. And there coffee is delishhhhh. Enough said. Just go.
Be sure to try the spring rolls.
"Whenever hubby and I return from visiting the in-laws in Ohio, we feel compelled to purge processed and fast food that we have consumed with something fresh and raw. So inevitably we order sushi. But we discovered a great alternative of anti-Ohio ordering at Lotus Cafe. Everything was fresh and tasty. The pork noodle salad was filling without being overwhelming. Also the egg roll that comes with it breaks up the monotony of salad well. The pork had a little fat, but the ingredients were generally good quality. Hubby ordered the classic banh mi, but they were out so he got the honey pork sandwich for free. A little sweet for him and a little heavy with the shallots but still really good flavor and, again, everything seemed fresh. We like this addition to University Village!"
"Best teriyaki/soy glazed fried chicken wings ive had yet. Maintains its crispiness while flavorful and juicy. My guilty pleasure right now and on days i feel a lil too guilty ill have their papaya crispy rice cake salad which is so delicious u wont even feel like ure eating something healthy! Its more of a to-go place to me, but i always drive out here for my cravings anyway. Price is very reasonable for its fresh and flavorful ingredients."
"I heart Banh Mi. This small treasure tucked near the back of Maxwell St is where it's at!So far I have eaten both the Ginger Chicken and Sunny Side Beef sandwiches and both were incredible. If you like egg on sandwiches, go for the Sunny Side Beef. All of the ingredients are super fresh and from what I hear, I need to order some wings next visit. Go here. NAOW. Oh and they accept LevelUp."
"Amazingly light, fresh and DELICIOUS !!!  honey pork is amazing and the soy glazed wings... always a great choice."
"Awesome Bahn MI sandwiches and awesome ice coffees.  Very small,  trendy and modern place.  So excited to have a modern Vietnamese cafe nearby!"
"The food is delicious (I particularly love the honey-grilled pork banh mi), but I'm mostly writing because I've been so impressed with their customer service.  On multiple occasions, Lotus has gone above and beyond to make sure our department catering orders were perfect -- on one occasion, they even took an e-mail order placed at midnight the night before, and handled multiple last-minute changes to the order with cheerful ease.  Highly recommended."
"Never disappointed, small menu but that's why everything is so good!! I usually just get the sunny side beef"
"Fantastic sarnie. Went for the beef with sunny side egg, which was cooked to perfection. So many flavors going on, so fragrant too. Then the crunch of the daikon with the beef and yoke running through it. Great job! Wonderful bread as well. I shall return."
Try everything! Eat the store.  Please never go out of business.  The bubble tea is one of the best in Chi-Town and your Banh Mi are to die for.  *dead*
"Excellent sandwiches. Sandwiches are made to order and use very fresh ingredients. The atmosphere is very nice and cozy. Love their presentation of food. Very clean and modern. Highly recommend this place. As for comparison, you have Ba Le but their banh Mi's read and ingredients are top notch. Also it seems as though they pack their sandwiches a lot more compared to a Ba Le."
"I might have a new addiction. Possibly the best sandwich I've ever had. The warm-spicy-tender meat and cool-sweet-crunchy slaw that another reviewer mentioned was just spectacular. An explosion of flavor and texture. Nicely done, Lotus! Do yourself a favor and make a point of stopping in. You won't regret it."
"FAST delivery, great food, excellent pricing - thank you!!!If only they started making pho....."
"We came here last night after hearing some great reviews, and Lotus did not disappoint. The bread that the Banh Mi is served on is everything you could hope for - crispy, but not falling apart like some others in the city. The ingredients on the sandwich were stellar. We tried the Belly Classic (best we've had in Chicago) and the Honey Grilled Pork which had a subtle lemongrass flavor to it that we loved. The only thing I'd say is the sandwich could have used a bit more pickled veg to add more bite but otherwise, perfectly executed.And get the Shrimp Springrolls. Perfectly made with crispy shallots tucked inside to add a textural contrast!"
"This place is awesome.  The sandwiches are fresh and delicious, but the secret is the bread!  It's soft yet crispy.  My favorites are the lemondgrass and honey pork.  We also always order the garden spring rolls and soy glazed wings.  My only complaint - the menu is really small.  Would love to see a drink and dessert menu as well as expanded appetizer selection.  However, I see the beauty in being awesome at something small."
"The food you get here, especially considering the prices, is unreal. They have some of the best veggie options! The bread is warm when they give you your sandwhich- like straight out of the oven warm. IT'S SO GOOD!!"
"Small sandwich shop next to Lucky's, also serves boba smoothies and coffee.Went there and ate the Honey Grilled pork, and I truly enjoyed it. Although the price (5.45) is slightly pricey for Banh Mi, but then again, this is not Little Saigon of Westminster, California, where the banh mi is $3 each and you get the 6th one free if you buy 5.. I'm guessing this price is pretty avg for Banh Mi in Chicago? But anyway, the sandwich itself was solid.Pros about the sandwiches here are that the ingredients are pretty fresh it seems. The pickled vegetables were crunchy and juicy at the same time. The meat in my honey grilled pork was flavorful and tender. The bread was fresh and I loved how it was toasted, this is a definite plus above the traditional banh mi where the french rolls tend just to be average.Would definitely visit again to try for the other sandwiches!!!It's a good alternative on the nights when you're hungry and looking for a solid meal but aren't looking to give yourself a cardiac arrest."
YAYYYY. theres alot better food now around UIC!love their honey grilled pork when its freshhh MMMMM.and the sunnyside beef :]also their eggrollsss omnomnomnomlavlavlav their sugarcane and the jasmine green tea milk tea :DDDthe place is ADORABLE and just so cozy and warmand so are the people!!! they really friendly ^^
"Love the fresh, crusty bread! The three of us had the ginger chicken, honey pork and sunny side beef. Loved the taro smoothies with tapioca too! The sandwiches have a healthy and fresh taste; not too heavy. Employees weren't super friendly, but not negligent either. I will be back."
"Finally!  Lotus Cafe is one of the first Vietnamese restaurant to open near UIC or better yet, the south side of Chicago!  I have been waiting forever for a place to serve banh mis and THEY DO IT WELL!  The concept of Lotus Cafe is great... if you are hungry you can order one of the larger banh mi sandwiches, but if you are just looking for a small quick snack, they offer the recently-made-popular bao!  Each of the options pack a lot of flavor, especially with the pickled vegetable toppings, and best of all, for a good price!  It is hard to choose just one so enjoy mixing and matching and hope this blog entry helps you make the right decision!  By the way, the ladies that run the shop are extremely nice!UPDATE:  I think they stopped selling the Bao options, but have expanded their menu."
"Definitely my go to spot for a quick Vietnamese food fix on the south side! With traffic the way it is in Chicago I'd starve if I had to drive north every time I wanted a banh mi sandwich or spring rolls. I love the shrimp spring rolls and the sauce they come with just makes my taste buds happy! We've tried the belly classic, honey grilled pork and the sunny side beef and love them all.  Inexpensive lunch and one of my favorite spots to call ahead and pick up with the loading zone outside."
"brand new and opened just today, I saw Banh Mi and memories of these sandwiches from when i was in high school came rushing back! Cute cafe, clean, all of the menu written on a chalk board behind cashier, individually brewed cups of vietnamese coffee, had the house blend and I'm not a regular coffee drinker, but this was fantastic! Next time I will try the tea as this is what I drink regularly, today being first day jitters and all for them (need some skim milk too!) :)Had the regular banh mi sandwich and it is a large portion for the money, which for students would be ideal (i'm no student but who doesn't like getting more for their money?). Now that I'm back in Chicago, the variety of banh mi sandwiches will be at my disposal, but I was pleasantly surprised by the quick stop-in and very yummy sandwich I ate at home for lunch, I plan to return and try the other items on their menu and luv that it's close-by to the west loop!"
A real find at the south end of the UIC campus.  Genuinely delicious.  Recommended!
"Fabulous. Rarely do I remember, not to mention wax nostalgic about a sandwich...but this place has the best ever. Will have to return with my vegan chum!"
"I've eaten here a few times and must say they have some really good sandwiches!I've tried all 4 of the meat sandwiches, and they are all rock solid. I haven't brought myself to try their vegetarian options, but I'll get to it eventually.I normally eat at Nhu lan or Bale, whichever is convenient, but once I tried this place, I honestly couldn't go back to those places. I think what really sets them apart is the fact that they cook everything to order on a flat grill. Everything tasted so fresh and natural vs. microwaving like NL and Bale. The only downside is that their wait time is longer, but I guess like the song says, ""good things come to those who wait""Overall, I would say this is the best sandwich I've had in a long time, easily the best banh mi ever. This place is up there with my other favs like Twin Anchors, Great Seas and Havana 1. Hmmmm, kinda craving one right now!"
"Now, I am not an authority when it comes to Banh mi sandwiches...but I have to say these were GREAT! I had the sunny-side beef and my girlfriend had the ginger chicken. Both flavor combos were delicious. We also split spring rolls--very fresh. And the coffee is also a must try!The atmosphere is very nice, modern yet rustic...if that makes sense. And free wi-fi! It would be a lovely place to grab coffee, some food, and get some work done.I also have to mention the customer service was great & very friendly. The gentleman there made sure to go out of his way, which I appreciated very much.I'll definitely be back to try some of the other menu items--they all sound tasty for carnivores and vegans alike, and are priced well."
"Stepped in the other night with a craving for Banh Mi.  My first one since moving to Chicago.  The bread was good, the food was made to order.  I had spring rolls also.  It was inexpensive and delicious.  I do with the sauce with the spring roll would have been more peanuty like but it was still tasty.  The owner is a photographer too so that makes this place even more special!"
Favorite spot in the neighborhood! I get the vegan papaya salad xtra jalapeño every other day of the week. Sometimes I'll add the garden spring rolls. They also have a vegan bahmi sandwich as well...THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING VEGAN FRIENDLY!!
"We chose to deliver.  The food was amazing but waiting for it wasn't.The Napa Salad is great, and the spring rolls were really fresh.I had the beef sandwich and the wife had the vegan.  Both were tasty, but the best part was the bread.We will order again."
"Writing as a member of a vegetarian family with 3 kids, 10-14, I can say this place is wonderful. The sandwiches, spring rolls and egg rolls are delicious and the service is lovely. Even our picky eaters wanted to come back soon!One warning for vegetarians, 1 veg sandwich comes with a fish extract (or fish flavor?) vinaigrette, but they happily substituted the ginger vinaigrette upon request."
"Really tasty, cheap. Portions are a little small, but well-sized for the price!"
"Ran into this place randomly on yelp as I was running errands in the area.  So glad I did!!  I had the Honey Grilled Pork  and wifey opted for the Sunny Side Beef.  Don't eat a lot of Banh Mi, but this is the best I've had. We also had the Garden Spring rolls and a Strawberry Mango Smoothie.  It took a little bit of time to come out, but more importantly, everything was fresh.  For the price, you can't go wrong here.  The dipping sauce for the sping rolls was excellent.  The place is small but you can take the meal outside as well.  Park in the garage next door for cheap and easy parking.  I'll definitely be back here to try the other items on the menu."
"Pork belly classic was the perfect blend of ingredients. The bread was crunchy and soft, the slightly warm meat was enhanced by the crunch of the veggies and mild vinegar flavor of the pickled toppings. Delicious! Lady working was very friendly and pleasant. What a great addition to the area. Can't wait to try more."
"I have not eaten banh mi since I left Toronto, where they used to sell freshly made sandwiches for $1 each. And I'm not even mad about paying close to 6 times that for these tasty little sandwiches.The first time I had them, someone ordered them for lunch for work. I ordered the veggiecado, which was so tasty! The fried sweet potato strings were a really nice touch! The bread was soft and crusty on the outside, and they are so generous with the fillings! It's a little impossible to eat the entirety of the layers in one bite, unless you're an anaconda! I've also ordered the classic pork belly sandwich -- also delicious, though it doesn't come with the bits of sweet potato. The shrimp rolls are also good, though the dipping sauce is a little too sweet. All in all, I would definitely recommend this place whether to dine in or to order out!"
