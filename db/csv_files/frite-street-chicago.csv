Frite Street
"Ooo La La ~ Oui oui ~ fancy french fries in my belly~~~ (I said all of that with a French accent, wearing a black & white striped shirt and red beret, while stroking my curly mustache).Not only does Frite Street have the best poutine in the city but their prices are completely reasonable. They have a bunch of different fry dishes but I had to go for the poutine on my first trip. The gravy was just delicious with a good amount of peas & cheese cards throughout plus the portion was very generous for just $6. I'd get this again in a second and will highly recommend it to any people on the search for great poutine in the city.You can add an egg for $1 and as an egg crazy girl, you best believe I huevo-ed up my dish.They have a wide variety of dipping sauces if you want the plain fries for $3 and a ton of other cool fry meals I'd love to try. Each day they also have a special fry platter. I've tried a Mexican fry dish that was fantastic.When my friend and I dined in, they sent out a dessert for us on the house! Their sugar donut is PHENOMENAL! Way better than donuts I've had from shops that cater exclusively to the dough creations. It was so soft, served warm with tons of sugary goodness and fantastic flavor. I'm definitely going to be getting one of those every time I pop in!What worries me is they don't seem to get much foot traffic! When we dined there on a weekend, we were the only ones in the entire time. Not cool, my fellow Avondalers, not cool! Get yourselves over to Frite Street for an indulgent but well worth the calories meal."
"Mega portions of fries. Many potatoes have died making it in this box. I think I fried food myself out from eating snack/dinner/breakfast. Do share it!I really like the concept and the vibe, it's fun and casual, even the prices for what you get.  Punchcard for 5 specialty frites for 1 free frite. They have daily specials. I went with the Elote frites with cheese sauce. It was ok. I wish they went with a different type of potato (golden) and go easy on the salt."
"The literal frites at Frite Street are solid. The menu is clearly informed by a mission, however, I don't think, at least in the case of the Korean frites, this mission was successfully executed. I love kimchi. I'm partial to making the Momofuku version at home. Korean pals said it ranked with their mom's versions. What was on the frites was not kimchi, but a slaw. There was nothing remotely kimchi about it, or even vaguely inspired by kimchi. This was disappointing. My expectations were not met on the flavor front.I think Frite Street would be excellent drinking food. Or help tame a hangover the next day. But it's location will likely hinder you accessing their frites when you're probably most inclined to have a hankering. It reminds me of a place in the Village in NYC. They should move to a spot with more foot traffic and bars. Then I think they could go home and roll around in their money."
"Holy flavor fry bomb! I got the Korean, which consists of pork belly, house made kimchi, garlic aioli all on top of hand cut French fries. It was creamy, crunchy, garlicky goodness. They've got an expansive fry menu that has something for everyone - poutine, Italian beef, Mac and cheese-topped, and more. It's a tiny little place, with an 8 person table and a small bar. I wouldn't come with a big group but if you're in the area and can take away, do your thing!"
"The wife and I were running errands up near Avondale and getting those familiar hunger pangs. A generic Yelp search turnt up the newly opened Frite Street. According to the Yelps, Frite Street was started by a food truck group that was positively rated. Plus, french fries. So yes, in.These are gourmet fries to the max. The fries themselves are good on their own: freshly cut with a nice dash of sea salt. But of course, you can and should get the specialty fries with all sorts of amazing goodness atop these potatoes (or po-tah-toes, if so inclined).We went with the Friday fish fry (available Saturday if there's leftovers!) and the Sriracha buffalo chicken. The monstrous size of these boxes makes it easy to share one between two, but if you'd like to diversify your taste portfolio, sampling multiples makes sense. We also asked for a side of cheese sauce, which they kindly gave to us gratis, along with an order of doughnuts. Both are delicious.The cost of the frites add up when you're ordering specialty, but the fries are so loaded it feels like a full meal. I really liked the fish fry. The nuggets were dunked in a light cornmeal-esque crust, and the light, vinegar-y tartar sauce was a great complement. The pulled chicken was relatively tasteless on its own, but compensated well by being dunked in the buffalo sriracha. Like the tartar, the ranch dressing was more runny buttermilk than thick and creamy.Overall, this is a good place to get your french fry fix on. I enjoyed it."
"It's a new place that has a great, innovative concept of western-style fast food, yet they make it gourmet, easy-to-consume, and made-to-order fresh.  It's located in a super-unassuming, remote part of Elston in the Avondale neighborhood, close to the Kennedy Expressway.  I determined to try it today for lunch on my own, because according to what yelpers have mentioned in the recent reviews, they have fish on Fridays.  And they did!  I was welcomed by a young lady at the counter and ordered the catfish special with egg (adding an egg costs $1 extra).  They do accept credit cards.  The entire dining room was pretty tiny, with a large rectangular table in the center and some high chairs with a wall-table on the side.  I wouldn't consider this as a hole-in-the-wall just yet, but perhaps there's more decor to come?  If you're a lover of gourmet fries, I will definitely recommend this place for me.  However, if you're not so adventurous when it comes to food, you might not enjoy as much as I would.  The catfish was cooked just perfectly.  It complemented nicely with the fresh-cut fries, pickles, and diced green onions.  Although it was salty as I was getting to the end, I still couldn't help myself and consumed it all!The portion was fairly large. I peeked through the young lady's Mac & cheese since she was sitting diagonally across to me.  Yeah, if you're a light-lunch eater, you will probably take home the rest.  I did kindly ask the lady at the counter if they cater to vegetarians, and the answer is affirmative.  I will bring my hubby along next time.  They have pretty limited hours currently: Tuesdays to Saturdays, from 1030 hour to 1630 hour.  I believe the street parking isn't difficult if you can make it here during their business hours."
"I can't say enough good things about this food!  The restaurant itself is a little divey for sure, but the sliders were amazing as were the frites.  Try the Baby Bacon slider.  2 sliders and an order of frites is a lovely dinner for two.  In a tough location, but not too hard to get to from the Belmont bus or hit up their Slide Ride food truck."
"On my first visit,  I had the Korean frites. THEY WERE ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!  I don't know how they came up with that recipe, but I'm glad they did. They were PERFECT and would definitely recommend them.  On my second visit I tried the Italian Beef frites. They were good as well although I would have liked for them to have more Italian beef on them, especially for the price. The taste was still on point. So far my fave is the Korean. This place is so close to my house, I have to stop myself from going too much. Looking forward to trying more....."
"overall good concept, lots of different fried and some mini burgers. friendly, small.great cheese fries and poutine. Italian beef sandwhich was averagewe'll be back"
"This place is as good as it gets: fries, pork, cheese, scallions, gourmet ketchup, slick sliders, and a counter maid with a 40's aesthetic! Good portions, good price and a return customer card to boot. We will be back very soon."
We walked in and told the women at the counter it was our first time. There was so much to choose some and she was a great help to insure we chose the perfect meal for our taste buds. I was pleasantly surprised! I tried the pulled pork and my friend had the Italian beef. We highly recommend both! Also their sweet potato fries with cinnamon and frosting is to die for!!!
"This may be the only place where fries are the main attraction and burgers are the side.You'll get a heaping pile of fries with a modest variety of dipping sauces (I am partial to the chipotle mayo myself) and a wonderful menu of toppings, including pork belly, curry, Italian beef, and kimchi.If you're itching for a burger to go with your frites, you can order a slider that is just as tasty as the fries.Come back on Fridays for the catfish, even if it's not Lent and you're not Catholic! No guilt here!A very nice addition to the Avondale eating scene."
"The fries were fine not exceptional, especially for the price. The woman working the counter was annoying to say the least and was very strange. EVERYTHING has green onions on it, EVERYTHING!"
The Mac Daddy (mac n cheese and pulled pork) was very good and service was friendly. Fries seemed a tad overfried but nothing too serious. I'll be back
"Came here for the fries, left with a few dozen donuts. Not just any donuts. They are by far the BEST and most delicious donuts I've ever had in my entire life. I'm serious. And I'm not even a donut person. This is like, the Atlantis of donuts in Chicago. Both hidden and so amazing you would think its mythological. Sooooo good. Seriously good. Five stars JUST for the donuts. Props to the sweet and pretty blonde lady who gave us complimentary donuts and started an addiction for both me and my adipose. Fries- you can read the other reviews. But honestly come to this place for the sweets!!"
"I'm a frequent patron of the Slide Ride (the food truck owned by the same people operating Frite Street), so I was bound to stop by their brick-and-mortar location at some point.We ordered the Korean (crispy pork belly, kimchi, and garlic aioli) and the Tijuana (shredded pork, cheese, tomato, green onion, jalapeño) frites, and both were amazing. These folks just have a way with pork. I shouldn't have been surprised - I'm well aware of this given that I'm addicted to all of their pork sliders on the truck - but seriously, I don't know how they do it. I don't even usually like kimchi, but I think it went well with the dish since most of it is pretty greasy and heavy, and the acidity of the kimchi helps. The Tijuana was even better - cheese sauce delicious, shredded pork amazing.Definitely worth a visit - the food is inexpensive and you get huge portions for what you're paying. This one meal filled me up for pretty much the entire day, zero joke. I'm sure I'll be back - there honestly wasn't a single thing on the menu that didn't sound appetizing to me, so it'll take me quite a few visits to try them all."
"I heard about this new restaurant that has opened recently in Avondale. Being a local, I decided I should give it a try before is reaches the wait time level of Hot Dougs. Very cute place. Not a lot of space. But, they have done a nice job of dressing the place up. I was greeted by the adorable Angelica. I don't know how Frite Street found this girl. But, she embodies the vibe of the place. Very friendly and dresses in Pin-Up girl attire. She absolutely completes the ambiance. It is Friday. So, I decided to order the Fryday Fish Fry and Angelica recommended the Mac Daddy. So, I went with that. I also took a small container of the Banana Ketchup. We chatted a bit while my order was prepared fresh. I will say that the next time I eat here, I will stay and eat to compare how the fries keep during take out.I live close and didn't dally to open the containers so there shouldn't have been to much steam built up to ruin the fries. The meals are so good. The tartar sauce on the fish fry is tangy and perfect. The fish is fried to order and that makes for a perfect crispy topping to the frites. The Mac Daddy is sin in a cardboard container with pretty handwriting on it. The pork and mac and cheese combine for awesomeness to top the frites. This could easily become a favorite local dish for me.I will say that the frites were a little soggy. That could be the toppings and it could be the condensation in the container. Like I said, I will have to try eating at the resturant next time. I don't think the frites NEED to be crispy. But, I like em that way. The meals are still awesome with the soggy frites. ONe of these days when my wife isn't around to yell at me that I am killing myself, I will pick up from both Frite Street and Kumas Korner and gorge myself on culinary debauchery. I just will have to wrap my head around Metal Bar and Pin-Up girls in the same night. Yes...Frite Street is that good."
Wow!Wasn't sure what I was getting myself into with this place but was very surprised! French Fries that have that golden brown almost carmalized sweet balance where they bend but aren't soggy with a mountain of goodness carefully slapped on top!!I went with the Korean BBQ as it was popular and have to tell you that the pork belly was fantastic!! Yes it has a jelatinous fat strip on it but it is pork belly afterall!! Do it!!!Considering this place recently popped up after Hot Doug's closing means a new gem in the area and BEST OF ALL... VERY REASONABLY PRICED!! Less than $10 for a canned S. Pelligrino & meal makes this place a regular choice for me.
I like that this place is small and comfy. Immediate welcome when you walk in. The smell is delicious before you get in the door. Saw this on TV and had to come and see if its a good place. It is definately a good place to stop in and get some tasty food.
If you want great fries you can get them plain or with fantastic toppings.  Add one of their delicious sliders and you have a meal that you can't get anywhere else unless you run into the Slide Ride.  They have the friendliest staff.
Want to taste flavor-packed food that has out of control flavor? Had the pulled pork slider - DELICIOUS - the guinness gravy fries with peas - DELICIOUS - this is one joint that proves that overhead (fancy lighting and atmosphere) has nothing to do with great food. You WILL NOT be disappointed.Yummy!
"After driving by for the first couple months they were open, I finally made it over for lunch. Frite Street does amazing things in such a tiny place, it was a nice surprise. The specials and regular menu are very creative, and the food was very tasty. I had the ""3 little pigs which featured pulled pork, pork belly, topped with chicharrón. The portion was generous and the food was flavorful. Service was timely and the counter girl was very sweet. It's a great addition to the neighborhood for sure. Looking forward to going back for lunch soon."
"Nice little restaurant. I got the plain jane and it was really good. Fries were fresh cut and crispy. Really inexpensive too. On a side note, i walked in there with my work boots and i left a trail of mud which i didnt realize until i was done. I offered to mop it, which she wouldnt let me do. If you see this, just wanted to make sure you know im not a slob and sorry for leaving a mess!"
"I tries the plain cheese fries with the chipotle mayo which was too good for words. And it was as good as a meal. My boy friend tries the Korean kimchi fries and loved it. Its heavy, salty, fresh, hot and there are many many options to chose from. Great service"
"While driving down Elston, I spot this place from the corner of my eye. I looked at Frite Street's reviews and nearly all of them were excellent. We decided to stop by and dine in. We were pleasantly surprised by the menu as it catered to all tastes. The main attraction here are the frites, of course, although there are some sliders that are offered. So with these frites, you have a layer of hand-cut fries with different kinds of toppings. You can get them as plain as frites with you choice of dipping sauce to as international as Korean with pork belly and kimchi. I chose to get the frites with Sriracha buffalo chicken and it was just amazing! It consisted of pulled chicken in a sriracha buffalo sauce with celery, shredded carrot, and ranch dressing. It was such a delicious combo and I nearly scarfed it down in one sitting. The frites were perfectly crisp and the tanginess of the Sriracha buffalo chicken went so well with the fries and ranch. The place is small with a counter and stools against the wall and a communal table in the center. Service was very friendly and food came out pretty quick. Frite Street was a wonderful find and I'd definitely be back again to try out the other options."
"Would not have believe fries could taste so divine!  Was greeted by a beautiful young lady who made me feel as if I was in her home and she, the most gracious hostess.  The restaurant held several bar stools against the wall-length counter and one long ""community table.  Had the Sriracha Buffalo Chicken and my brother had the Korean.  Both were out of this world!!  Great prices for awesome-tasting and high-quantity amount of food!  I live in the Western suburbs but will return with other family members so they can enjoy this taste-sensation!"
The fries were really great! I had the Italian beef. It was good. I liked the different kinds of sauces. A little pricey for French fries though.... Even if I got an Italian beef from Al's up the street and fries it probably would have been cheaper... But not as cool.
"Do you like fries? Do you?! Then this is the place for you!What a great concept - take the standard frite (french fry in.... french) and add sauces, meat, cheeses, veggies and anything else you can think of to turn it into a full gourmet meal.We ordered the Italian Beef and the Mac Daddy. The Italian beef was much as you would imagine, with juicy shredded roast beef, cheese, and giardiniera on top of the fries. It was pretty spectacular, especially about halfway down, once all of the beefy-spicy-tangy juices had soaked into the top of the french fries.My frite partner in crime got the Mac Daddy, which is a pile of fries topped with mac & cheese, pulled pork, and a crazy delicious cheese sauce. He has been talking about the cheese sauce ever since, so I'm pretty sure we'll be having that again in a day or so.As far as the full menu, they also serve sliders (ala The Slide Ride, one of Chicago's oldest and best food trucks, and perpetrator of this french fry heaven), and many other types of gourmet fries, including a sriracha buffalo chicken version that sounds incredible.  I can only theorize of all the divine creations they will come up with in the future - the french fry potential is limitless!If you're really boring, you can get the Plain Jane, a giant pile of plain french fries for only $3 bucks.  If you do, you'd be a fool not to try one of the dozen or so tasty dipping sauces they have lovingly crafted for you.Overall, a great place with delicious food and affordable prices! Support this small business!"
"Frite Street is awesome.  We brought beers (it's BYOB!) and ordered 4 different things, and they were all incredible: cheesy jane with hot peppers, fish fryday, sriracha buffalo chicken, and chicken fried fries with gravy.  They were all so good, but the fish fryday was probably my favorite.  The catfish tasted really fresh and was perfectly fried -- so delicious!! Super fresh ingredients (they even smoke their own bacon!) and really tasty and interesting flavor combinations on the menu.  This is so not fast food, but a seriously delicious gourmet meal experience.  Will definitely be back soon to try the other menu items!"
"When visiting from Scottsdale, AZ I met some girlfriends there for a late lunch.  It's a tiny hole in the wall but the food was amazing.  We had the Catfish fries on a Friday.  It had 3 good size pieces of Breaded Fried Catfish on a basket of Russet Fries for $7.00.They have lots of slider too and daily specials each day.Everything is freshly made and there are about 6 sauces to choose from.  We sat and ate and chatted for about an hour and they brought us some complimentary donuts.They were warm, tender and delicious. I saw this place on Yahoo's 50 best French Friesjoints in the U.S.Try it for carry-out or picnic table style dining inside."
"Happy that I was able to stop by Frite Street today and fill my belly with delicious, crispy fries. My boyfriend is a fry enthusiast. Living in Avondale, this has been a problem since Hot Doug's closed...but not any more! Portions are large--we had some plain fries (these were completely obliterated) and the Curry Jane, with curry sauce and I had to take my portion home.  It will be soggier than when I had it but I know the flavor of the fries and sauce will hold up.I look forward to trying some of the fancier combinations since I know how good the basic fries are. We'll be back!"
"This place is a hole in the wall kind of place, but with gourmet food.  Inside you can probably fit maybe 20 people.  We tried every slider on the menu and had the Mac Daddy.  Thumbs up for the Mac Daddy.  Their pulled pork is so delicious, not too sour and just the right amount of sweet.  I was impressed that even though the fries were topped with the pulled pork, not too many of the fries were soggy.  Most of the sliders were pretty tasty.  However, I'd probably past on the Italian beef.  The bread was just too hard.  One turn off was was that the bathroom was pretty dingy and there was no handsoap.  Note for next time, go pee a home first."
"GET THE MAC DADDY. Dear God, it's the most delicious gluttony I have ever tasted. Frites, BBQ pulled pork, mac n cheese (and chives which is not on the menu and I picked off). I'm still dreaming about this divine dish. My boyfriend got a chili frite with like 12 different types of beans and we got a side of sliders that were also amazing. The pinup girl behind the counter who waited on us was adorable and courteous. I only wish they were open for dinner (lunch only). Also, ambiance - you can tell they're trying but it's a little sad. I'd still go back for the food though!"
"Just had my first Frite Street experience! I rushed to get there before they closed on a Saturday, so I ordered something simple--just the regular fries with cheese sauce and scallions. First of all the cheese sauce is SO delicious! The fries tasted fresh, and it was a good-sized portion. The girl at the counter, Angelica, was very nice and helpful. The simplicity of the place was awesome--the food is the main attraction here, and they do not disappoint. Can't wait to go back again and order something crazy!"
"Omg everything from the adorable hostess who takes your order to the pound (yes pound) of fries topped with a perfect balance of cheese, meat, and sauce makes this places a keeper :) we had a special (fries topped with pork belly, shredded pork, cheese, jalapeño sauce, and picked carrots and 2 sliders--buffalo chicken and bacon baby. The sliders were much bigger than I thought and were delicious. Beef patty was perfectly cooked and shredded chicken was slathered in a perfect buffalo/siracha combo! And the fries. Omg the fries. Thick, crispy, delicious. All he ingredients were well balanced. I hate loaded fries with too much cheese and not enough meat and these fries were perfect. Will def be coming back. Do yourself a favor and try and siracha ketchup. Life changing."
The kimchi frite.....oooooh eeeeeem geeeeee. Completely awesome. Was ashamed I ate the whole thing. So tasty
this place is the shit!! sooooo gooood. all u need to know is ......the adress! then go. i love this place and the food....yes yes yes
"I know the people behind Frite Street as they've operated one of Chicago's best food trucks in The Slide Ride. When they opened this shop, I knew I'd love it. I've only been twice, but each time, the food was great. One was a sit-down order (Guiness Gravy Poutine) and the other take out (Sriracha Buffalo Chicken, Plain Jane and a couple sliders). All were excellent. I can't wait to go back and try more of the menu."
Excellent! Crisp frites and a nice variety for everyone! A great place to stop in for lunch and everyone there was friendly and helpful. We will be back often!
