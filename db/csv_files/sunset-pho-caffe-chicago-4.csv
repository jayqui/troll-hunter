Sunset Pho Caffe
"We loved this place so much, we came here two nights in a row. The first night was for a get together for a group of friends that I'm going to Japan with in August. We walked in to some live music being played. Now this restaurant is not that big, but a small stage was set up for a band to play anyway.We sat down and watched some of the CoAmerica soccer tournament. This place has some nice flat screen TVs positioned very well throughout the place. We were able to speak to the owner named Zel who provided us with some smooth free shots. After we took those we began to order. We shared an appetizer of Croatian sausage spring rolls, which were awesome. We also had an app of basically sausage links, with bread and onion, which was also delicious.The main course was to die for. I had the rare steak and flank steak pho. The broth was just the right consistency of spicy and mild. I've never had a broth that was so good that I literally finished all of it. The beef was tender and not dry while the noodle to broth ratio was on point.This is a place that should be on Argyle, but located on Western. It's a real gem.Oh an BTW, we came back the next night and had the same thing and it was still delicious."
"My wife, son and I were craving Pho. I bookmarked this place a couple of months ago and finally decided to come. Best decision. I ordered the Rare & Flank Beef Noodle Pho and my wife ordered the Veggies Noodle Pho. As an appetizer we ordered the Vegetarian Fresh Spring Rolls. The food was great and the owners were fantastic. Most Phos that I have had have been really salty. This Pho was not salty at all. It had a lot of layers of flavor and was delicious down to the last bite. If you have driven past this place, park the car and go inside and try this place out. You will be happy you did!! The only complaint I have is that I did not take a picture of our food, so in the meantime, take my word for it. Enjoy!"
"DELIVERY ORDER REVIEW.Called to ask if they would deliver to a place approximately 4 miles away. They say yes. Wait, we don't have a menu and we're interested in pho. Man over the phone proceeds to explain the variety of options they have. AMAZING! You can't ask for better service than that. All on a Saturday night. To top it off, delivery guy (who I'm sure is the man who took the order) informed me off jazz on Wednesday night. So informative.As for the food it self, it's all about the details. I ended up with the beef stew (instead of pho, go figure). I found it to be quite delicious.  It was like beef stew and pho had a baby. The base was pho like, but stew tasting (does that make sense?). There were beef and carrots. And it came with noodles. So I think that's like a beef stew pho baby.Quite honestly, I was also impressed with the packing of the delivery items. Individual ziplocks with condiments, all utensils were there. I mean if it's forgotten, it's really no big deal cause it happens. And I was home, so I've got back up. But it's just always nice and thoughtful. The only thing was there was no sriracha. I don't know if that's standard or just the Asian in me, but where was it? It's ok, I got some at home. I would gladly try this place again, probably in person and get pho. You gotta get it while it's hot."
Now I have two favorite pho joint 'LC pho' and 'Sunset pho caffe'! So initially my thought about this place is the music was kind of off and it was pretty dark but when the crawfish came out second later I'm inhaling the yummy delicious crustaceans. OH MY GOODNESS the music started sounding better and nothing seemed to bother me anymore. TRY THE CRAWFISH! If you're on a date and reluctant to get messy.. Ditch the date and get down with the crawfish! Service was great as well. Although I would have to say LC pho does have better broth but I wouldn't rotating between the two.
"Wonderful!  Great food, pho , crawfish, spring rolls all delicious!  Owner and service so friendly.  Interesting food combinations, too. Very comfortable. Great outdoors space and jazz on Wednesdays. We'll be back!"
Interesting place with the bar in the front and the restaurant in the back. It doesn't look like a typical pho place when you walk inside. The husband and wife owners are very friendly and the food is very delicious. Beef pho and Vietnamese pork chop dish were done very well and the spring roll with Croatian sausage inside was a very interesting combination. Portion was generous and many Vietnamese/Croatian choices in he menu. And the coffee ( Vietnamese or Italian cappuccino) was good.Can't wait to try other dishes in the menu.
I was driving around on a nice night looking for somewhere to eat. And lady's and gentleman. I found a hidden jem!! They've been open for a year now with the new ownership and new menu. The owners where very nice but most importantly the PHO was hands down the best ive had in the Chicago north side. I cant wait to try the rest of the menu. (Full bar fyi)
"I am in love !!! I found a place where I can eat amazing crawfish here in Chicago!!! I stopped in for some Pho that was super incredible warmed me up perfectly on this rainy day but what I didn't know I was going to find crawfish here! I gave it a try and it's the best I have ever had, the owner even made me fresh homemade bread to dip into their homemade crawfish sauce!!! Ugh I love you Sunset. Definitely will be back to try more different things!!"
Ngoc is an absolutely amazing owner. How sweet. She visited our table agter and outstanding dinner. She talked to us about the background of her hourney to this restaurant. The food tastes fantastic. This restaurant is just perfect. Comfortable delish and perfect!
"Unbelievably good !!!This place has just opened few months ago and it is amazing,healthy,and affordable. The taste was out of this world I could not believe it. You can feel how fresh and healthy the ingredients are. You should check it out and you will be addicted like us. It is kids friendly and the staff are really nice."
"We tried this place a month ago because I wanted to check out how legit their Viet food was....considering how there was a European bar in the front. Odd. But we tried the pho here on a cold weeknight. It was pretty good. Comparable to what you'd usually get on Argyle. Considering how close it is to our place, we'd definitely go here again to try their Banh Mi...I hear they bake the baguette fresh to order! Service is friendly and I think they are working on providing delivery service."
Come in and enjoy this awesome pho! The owner and cook is friendly and sweet. The pho makes you feel warm inside and you won't even notice the weird bar in the front.
"This place is the best. I started going a few months ago and I have been back almost every other week since. I got by boyfriend hooked too! I'm not Asian, but I went with a Vietnamese friend and she said it tasted like her mom's home cooking. The spring rolls are my staple. Pho is amazing! And Bahn mi (sandwich) is so great. Proof is in the details... They bake the bread for the sandwich once you order it. It's always fresh and always flavorful and great. I will probably go at least once a week now. Favorite food in the whole city."
"I loved everything I put into my mouth. And it was a lot. The spring rolls, the spicy lemongrass beef pho, the chicken banh mi, the watermelon smoothie that I slipped some vodka into, the coffee, it was really delicious, and I'm often disappointed by Vietnamese food. The atmosphere was nice and chill, and the owner was super sweet. He came over to apologize because he thought our food was taking too long (one of the cooks went home sick) and offered us a drink on the house. Don't be dissuaded by the lack of Vietnamese people running the show up front, these guys know what's up. I'd 100% be a regular if I still lived here."
"Fantastic pho. Fantastic service. The owner is a total sweetheart and takes pride in her product.  I've had a lot of pho in Chicago, and this establishment is top notch. Better than anything on Argyle street. Can't beat the atmosphere, bar in the front and great food in the back. There are always some interesting tunesplaying.  Come here even if it's a little out of the way for you, you won't regret it!"
My boyfriend came here with his roommate not too long ago and all he did was rave to me about how good the pho is. Of course being outside of argyle I get a bit skeptical. When my boyfriend took me here I was pleasantly surprised on how good the pho really is! They also give you a good amount of meat with the pho so I loved it even more  if you are ever around in the area give it a try! The cevapcici spring roll is pretty tasty too. It's a fusion of the regular Vietnamese spring roll with a kick of Croatian style meat.  the owner is also extremely nice which I always love supporting kind hearted people
"We strolled in just after 10 when the kitchen was supposed to be closed. However, the proprietor said it's cold and we need to eat so she stayed open for us! Whaaaaat?! I ordered the pho. I'm glad there's finally another Vietnamese restaurant besides Tank that serves a great bowl of pho!Also, awesome music on the speakers: Destiny's Child, Usher, Rihanna... I'll be back just for the food and service but the jams are another reason to return lol."
Amazing food! Super cool owners! Very reasonable price. I was able to feed my 4 year old here.  I highly recommend this place.  :-)
"Decided to stop on by on a whim with my date since it was very close to her place on  a Sunday night. According to Google, this was Vietnamese restaurant. When we stopped on in, we were initially confused. We thought we walked into the wrong place. The front part of the building is a bar with quite a few European customers hanging around. There was a little DJ booth spewing some eastern European music (probably Romanian). The back half was the actually Vietnamese restaurant. It was empty so we were promptly seated and they also  turned down the music (thank god). The place is nice and clean.  Upon reading the menu, we confirmed that this was actually the right place (hehe). We both ordered the beef flank pho. The food came out within 10 minutes. The presentation of the food was excellent. The pho tasted great! I had my fair share of pho around Argyle  and this was one of the best. The flavor of the broth was savory and the beef was tender. The owner, Ngoc, was awesome and attentive to our needs.  She was extremely nice and sweet. She explained that she wanted to keep the bar so she can keep it diverse and grow her business. Anyways, the only improvement I would suggest is maybe moving the bar in the back. to prevent the confusion. We almost walked out thinking the listing was wrong. Speaking to the owner, she states that almost all her new customers has that same sentiment. That is really the only flaw. I really hope she can do something to make the Vietnamese restaurant a more prominent part of the business. It can only help not hurt.With that said, I would highly recommend this place. It is affordable and delicious! I'm planning on making a visit pretty soon!"
"Found a new favorite place to get my grub on. This place is absolutely amazing, Ngoc, the owner is probably the sweetest and most genuine Vietnamese woman I have ever met. The food itself is phenomenal. Bar as well and they are open until 10pm if you call ahead of time there is a chance that they will prepare your meal despite that they just closed. It's not a guarantee but it couldn't hurt to try if you're in the neighborhood. Speaking of try, the pho and banh mi are exceptional ! Must try."
"Clean bar, friendly staff and reasonable drink prices. Would recommend to anyone. Tried a veal and lamb sausage...excellent. There is live jazz Wednesday night's and there was a blues band there when we stopped on a Saturday night"
Food is great and always fresh...Pho is delicious!  the owner is super friendly and so kind!!!! staff is always really friendly too  glad I food a good pho spot
Better than any place in Argyle and Hoanh Long on Lincoln. You just have to get pass the weird bar in front. Their Pho is good portion and great presentation. It was also piping hot! The broth was flavorful but didn't leave you super thirsty afterwards. Will have to come back to try their Bun Bo Hue and Banh Mi :)
"I really like their pho broth. The black pepper flake added to the broth gives it a special touch. I like this broth more than any of the ones from Argyle. The only room for improvement is that rare beef is not as thinly sliced as it should be. One of our friends got vermicelli and she didn't like it. I don't know about the rest of the menu, but the pho is good! They also serve chicken wings, fries etc. bar food."
"I originally posted a review a few months back, my review somehow was posted to not recommended? should not have been.. Had the shrimp satay and the shrimp spring rolls tonight.. The best in the city.. and I am a Viet food snob.. Keep up the good work.."
"It was also a Sunday night and we had a movie to catch on western.. We arrived around 6:00pm and did not walk out til about 8:30. Although you guys were very apologetic and also gave us what did come out for free. It looked as if everyone struggled to get their food on time.. You guys are very friendly, and I have said nothing bad about the food, because it is amazing! But you need to hire more people, the bartender walking back and forth from the front to the back is not very effective. She wrote everything down on our ticket but 3 out of the 5 things we ordered never came out and we were there 2 1/2hrs.."
"This place has new owners. Its actually called Sunset Pho Caffe now and lemme tell ya, this place rocks!!! Very clean, the staff is friendly (beautiful bartender), the food is great!!! I had the combination fried rice and it was amazing! The chef even spiced it up a little more for me! I highly recommend this place for food and drinks. I give this establishment 5 stars out of 5!"
"We came in after finding out that the pho place we were planning on going to was closed. As other Yelpers have said, the first impression was, ""Are we in the right place?"" Eastern Euro bar in front, Vietnamese food in back. The music was a bit on the loud side, but the waitress and owner could not have been nicer. We had the sausage spring rolls, which were very tasty. The rare beef pho was awesome. I would encourage you to try it out!"
"It was 10:00 pm on a Sunday. My wife and I were in Lincoln Square scrolling through the Yelp app looking for some Vietnamese food. After a few seconds, we came across Sunset Pho Caffe. I was skeptical of the perfect reviews- but it was 10 pm and we were hungry. Upon arrival, I thought we had the wrong address. Looking through the window, I saw two men sitting at a bar, a bartender, and what appeared to be an Car Auction on the television. My wife and I confirmed that this was indeed the place. Walking in, we were greeted by a very sweet little woman on her way out. She asked if we were there for food. ""Yes"", I replied. After I realized that this sweet little woman was the owner/chef? I told her I'd come back another time and that she should continue to go home for the night. She wouldn't take that as an answer, and proceeded to seat us in an empty restaurant. I was very glad she did.We ordered a Pork Bun, Beef Pho, and an order of egg rolls. Everything was absolutely fantastic. The pork in the bun was perfectly seasoned and caramelized. The broth in the Pho was very clean and light. The freshly ground black pepper on top completely brought the dish together. It was amazing.I can't wait to return. I'd even go as far as saying that SUNSET PHO CAFFE HAS THE BEST PHO IN CHICAGO.Recommendation: Beef Pho and an order of egg rolls."
Wtf. Mind blowing. Might be the best pho in the city right now. Front of the house is an eastern European bar...which is totally confusing because they're banging out the Vietnamese truth in the back. Holy Toledo. Argyle better be shaking in their pirate boots right now. Aaaaargyle. Seriously tho folks this spot is the truth. Beautiful people making beautiful food. Go now. Thank me later.
Amazing place good food and amazing people.love love love love manager she has a BIG heart
"A must try!  The food here was so delicious and the owners are the most welcoming people you will ever meet.  We have been a few times to this restaurant and liked everything we have ordered.  The spring rolls with the salmon are amazing, Bahn mi is as good as they get, Pho is spot on perfect, pork chops are just right.  We get something different every time and have yet to find something we didn't love. Are they in Grubhub yet?  I may be addicted."
"SO delicious! A hidden gem - honestly, if you're like me and crave pho on the coldest, most blustery nights of winter, this is the place you should go.My boyfriend and I came in here last night for dinner. The place itself is very interesting - half European bar in the front and in the back is a bright and open dining room. Ngoc, the owner (the sweetest and feistiest lady imaginable) was so attentive and funny! She was very gracious and told us about the food, giving suggestions, and joking with us. We decided on four things:Chicken Egg Rolls (Cha Gio Ga) - served in a little boat dish with a delicious sweet chili sauce, these were so tasty!Cevapcici Spring Rolls (Goi Cuon Cevapcici) - this was a suggestion from Ngoc, and she certainly knows her stuff. Two huge spring rolls with beef, veal, veggies, and rice noodles wrapped in rice paper with hoisin sauce for dipping. SO DELICIOUS. And they were big, two is plenty.Rare Beef Noodle Soup (Pho Bo Tai) - my boyfriend had this and said that the beef tasted like it was placed in the broth just seconds before it came to our table. So juicy and so tender! Definitely a winner.Sunset Pho Noodle Soup (Pho Dac Biet - Tai-Nam-Bo Vien-Gan) - I couldn't resist ordering the titular pho. It had rare beef, flank beef, meatball, and tendon as the meats. I've never tried tendon before, and I was pleasantly surprised! It's not grisly or chewy, it's actually quite delicious. I don't know how to explain it but you should definitely try it. The meatballs were great (homemade I assume?) and the rare beef was amazing. The portions are huge, and since I already helped myself to two appetizers, I had to take half of my soup home.All in all, the meal was great and Ngoc made the atmosphere homey and lovely. I will definitely be back - I can't wait to try the beef salad and chicken ginger salad! I'm happy that we found a favorite pho place."
I can't tell enough how good the Pho was. I licked the bowl and helped my friend finish his since I have more appetite than him. They have a decent size bar with a variety of liquors to your game day beers. The owners were very friendly and offered us some complementary drinks. Definitely go back every time I am in that area.
"Yummy food and super friendly staff. Pho is pretty awesome here! Totally confused when walked in about the bar up front and restaurant in back like other reviews but doesn't bother me that much. Came here at Thursday night at like 10pm , def like how it's a late night spot. Also extra bonus points for playing late 90's/00's jams like destiny's child and Leona Lewis bleeding love. Def would come back"
"Caveat: I've only been there on a Sunday night to pick up takeout. However, the few reviews feel very dated (and like they're reviewing a different restaurant!), so I thought I'd weigh in.Phoned in an order for takeout without seeing a menu (the link didn't work on my phone). Me: Do you a vegetarian pho?Them: Yes, what kind of broth would you like? Chicken or beef?So there's that. That's not a deal-breaker for me, so I chose the chicken.Arrived a few minutes early, and sat at the front bar while I waited. It's a bar/restaurant with a split personality. The front half is a pretty cozy bar, if well-lit. The back-half was a fairly sterile-looking restaurant.At any rate, $8.50 or so later, I'm headed home with a heavy to-go bag. Open it up and discover a large styrofoam container of soup (broth, bok choy, broccoli, mushrooms, carrots), a plastic baggie of bean sprouts, jalapenos, lime, basil and a cilantro-like thing that was not cilantro but was totally delicious and another styrofoam container of rice noodles, onions and green onions. Yum. The broth was perfect--very light and aromatic--all the fixings were fresh and tasty, and the combination was a very satisfying dinner (which I'm finishing now as breakfast).Would I go back? Yes, but not to impress anyone (and certainly not as a date night). The bar had the lion's share of the restaurant's atmosphere (which isn't saying too much). Just an L-shaped bar with a TV. I'd definitely check out more of the menu, and know exactly where I'm going when the winter blues hit."
"The best pho' we  have had north of Argyle. Very friendly. The bartender was super helpful. The owner was present and hospitable. You can tell he takes pride in the food. We ordered carryout, but would love to return to dine in. It was the Satuday before Easter and the owner made his mom's cheese pita bread to give to customers. Delicious! The food was amazing, fresh, flavorful, and hot. The place seems clean. Definitely a hidden gem."
"Found this place on yelp... They absolutely deserve the 5 stars. Delicious pho, clean/pretty, and great service. Will be back soon... This place is awesome!!!"
"My fiance and I were craving some pho and drove by this place. The food was really good we both got the beef pho, however we suggest getting the raw beef over the cooked it tasted much better being freshly cooked from the broth. The ambiance is super strange though. Walk in and there is a bar and then a nice dining area behind it. Everyone in there was of some sort of european decent and speaking in a foreign language and seated at the bar. We joked about it being a front for a european mob or something.  No one was in the dining in the actual dining room where we sat. The woman who made the food checked on us a few times and told us they are expanding their menu this January."
"This is one fun, crazy little place. It has the most wonderful European style coffee. The cappuccino milk is wonderfully stiff and will have you wondering if you somehow fell down a rabbit hole and landed in the Balkans where they make a proper cup of Joe. EVERY. SINGLE. TIME.  You will find a multitude of eastern European languages spoken here and some English, but that is half the fun. This joint has a laid-back vibe and the owner is often there serving drinks, cooking, and participating in general merriment. There is a small dance floor and a DJ booth so after enough libations impromptu dance parties with the most unlikely characters break out. There is food served in the late afternoon and into the evening. I strongly recommend the calamari and the crab cakes. Occasionally, the owner busts out some kind of exotic and hearty food from the old country and feeds the bar. Should you be so lucky to amble in on one of those nights!I totally recommend the plum liquor--Slivovitz. But beware, that medicine will put you down fast! Plan on taking a cab home."
