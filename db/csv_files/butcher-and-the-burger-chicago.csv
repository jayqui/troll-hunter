Butcher & The Burger
"After a few dine-in experiences and several carryouts, I can't say one negative thing about this place. (Ok, there is one super minor thing... I'll leave that for the end.)Do you crave a juicy, freshly grilled burger piled high with your favorite toppings of choice, nestled between two freshly baked, lightly toasted bakery buns? Come here.  Always friendly service. Burgers are grilled to order. Built to order. Always spot on. They even let you choose the seasoning in your Patty. I always go for the umami spice blend, which includes fresh ginger, garlic and scallions. Uniquely delicious, goes well with the Sriracha mayo. Butcher on site is their secret to such high quality patties. They offer a wide range of patty options, from grass fed beef to salmon to turkey and of course, the requisite veg-head offering. I've only tried their standard grass-fed beef options.  For a couple dollars extra, one certainly can't go wrong with the grass fed patty. But honestly, I think their standard beef is perfectly amazing --far above the standards of most other burger joints. My only complaint is I wish the sautéed mushrooms were bigger pieces. I no longer order the mushroom topping (which is a crazy notion for this fungus fein) because I only get a bunch of tiny little mushroom pieces. The problem with these tiny mushroom pieces is you don't even know the mushrooms are there until they start falling off the burger as you eat it --at which point, they are not worth picking up to finger-eat because they are so minuscule. That's my only complaint! Otherwise, Butcher and the Burger is poifect!"
"Sauntered into Chicago to visit my kids and wanted a quick, reasonably priced meal which would be better than average. My son who attends De Paul University suggested the Butcher & the Burger. Great choice! It's located just a few blocks from the campus and if you drive, there are plenty of parking spaces on the street, albeit paid parking.We arrived mid-day on a Wednesday so, no wait. You order at the register, find a table and they bring you the food. They offer several burger choices: beef, bison, shrimp. You then add toppings to your burger, which can grow the size of the burger to gargantuan!We decided to choose from the favorite menu. I ordered the Surf Burger which was a Shrimp Burger. It was all Shrimp, cooked just right and was offset with a spicy chipotle sauce. Very satisfying. The three of us shared a small fry, which was just the right amount.FYI: Butcher & the Burger offer De Paul students a 10% discount :)."
"It's the little things that sometimes breaks or makes a restaurant.After reading rave reviews about this place, I decided to check out this burger place, and I was quite excited to try the burger. While I was a little confused with the gigantic menu, the cashier was really helpful and recommended the house blend. The burger was fairly small and thin patty, but the house blend was quite delicious and seasoned well. Wish I had gotten more toppings as the lettuce and tomato and the mayo don't do the burger justice.However the little things make me not want to go back to the restaurant. I did not ask for onions in my burger, and it was included. I had checked in on yelp and got a free beignet with a beignet purchase, and the beignet was not included. On that note, the beignet was mediocre. A little too soft, almost soggy dough that's covered in powdered sugar."
"It was around the time of Burger Fest, and I didn't want to venture out into the heat and crowd, so I decided to FINALLY check out this place that my friend had been raving about.We went around 7:30pm and this place was packed! While waiting in line, I overheard a lot of frustrated customers who were waiting for their burger for over 25 mins, and I started getting worried, but luckily I wasn't that hungry. We ordered the burger featured in the James Beard's Better Burger Project and a large order of fries around 7:45pm. After hearing about the commotion earlier, I asked how long the wait would be and was told around 15 mins, so we decided to go for a walk around Lincoln Park. Once 15 mins elapsed so we headed back, but had to wait another 10-15 mins for our burger. FINALLY they called my name and it was time to eat. When I went to cut the burger to share with my friend, the burger was not medium rare. It was raw! So raw that the table next to us said that it looked purple! I hardly ever send anything back to the kitchen, but this burger was barely edible. While waiting on the burger to be properly cooked, we munched on the fries, but it was beyond salty. I tasted more salt than potato and was pretty disappointing. After 5 or so mins, our burger returned to us but now it was not even medium rare, but cooked all the way through. Even though I didn't like how my burger was cooked, it did have a lot of flavor and depth to it. Not a fan of the fries at all though only because it was too thick for my taste and way too salty for any person to consume. Overall, I think everyone there had the same mentality as me which was to hit up a burger place instead of the Burger Fest, so it was bad timing for me to check out this place. As a result, the kitchen couldn't keep up with the demand as their menu allows a lot of customization which gets time consuming. Don't get be wrong, the flavors were on point, but quality control in terms of cooking the meat to order is a big deal. Mine came out raw and then came out way too cooked for my taste. In the end, the atmosphere is chill. A good place to grab dinner with friends or with your family. The decor of the spice rack was neat and made the place homey."
"Rosa J. usually makes herself at home with the ""older"" folks in the city.  Blue-collar diners and working-class hotdog/burger joints are some of her best ""foodie on foot"" companions.  However, Rosa J. was doing her P.Y.T and ending up in ""Butcher & The Burger"" in Lincoln Park, less than one (1)-block west from CTA Armitage Brown/Purple Line station.  We weren't familiar with how the menu worked, but the enthusiastic young man at the register explained the menu and gave us his recommendation (Chicago steakhouse spice).  By the way, if you're a vegetarian or even a vegan, you won't feel left out and jealous of other chic carnivores consuming these juicy burger patties.  Hubby ordered the lentil-brown rice burger, with lettuce, tomatoes, avocados, and grilled mushrooms.  He also went with the wheat bun.  He said it was one of the best veggie burgers he has had so far.  I also had one (1) bite of that lentil-brown rice burger.  It didn't taste like a ""secondary substitution"" or a ""compromise"" because one chose not to have meat in his or her diet.  In other words, I would be very happy to order this burger without a doubt!  On the other hand, I went with the grass-fed beef burger, with avocados, a fried egg, onions, pickles, and Dijon mustard.  Although I forgot to request my fried egg to be made over-easy, it actually turned out just the way I liked it, for the ""split bun"" wouldn't be able to handle the runny egg as well as a ""pretzel bun"" would.  The pattie was thick, so I believe that consuming one (1) hearty burger was enough for an average individual's appetite.That Dijon mustard had a very strong kick.  I personally didn't mind it and thought that was a nice touch.  Nevertheless, if you often skip the wasabi at a sushi restaurant, I suggest that you stick with the regular mustard.  Their fries were also spot-on crunchy and deliciously salty.  To be honest, some people might have minor complaints on the pricing because they were quite expensive ($32 and some change for our meal, including a Filbert's cream soda hubby added on).  After we finished everything, hubby and I concluded that money we spent on our dinner this evening was worth every penny.  I guess we just have to splurge a little on quality hand-crafted finger food every once in awhile!"
"This place makes fantastic burgers using premium quality ingredients and condiments that satisfy a variety of palates.  First off, I love the interior decor that screams artesian and butcher!  One can get overwhelmed with the daunting menu, but the staff are very helpful in giving recommendations based on what you are looking for.  They also offer several gourmet burgers where you don't have to create a burger from scratch on your own.  I tried the American medium.  It was amazing!  Even though I'm not a pickle person, the pickles were delicious.  The burger is big, but it was still manageable to hold with both hands without going to pieces.  Hubby made his own and tried the Chicago Steakhouse spice which he really liked.  We split a small side of fries, which was definitely more than enough for two people.  Taking our servers recommendation, we ordered a side of the Black Truffle Aioli with Hubby's burger which we used as a dipping sauce for the fries (you will not regret it!).  The fries were hot, fresh, thick, and crispy, just the way I like them.  We both had the split top butter egg buns for our burgers, but next time I'm going to try the pretzel.  The freshly squeezed lemonade was refreshing and just on the side of sweet that was perfect for summer."
"God danggit! Mother Fudger! I'm pissed off. My Friday Night plans are ruined! For months I have heard only awesome things about this place, seen tastey pictures and I've had juicy dreams. Holding the trophy high in the air and yelling ""we did it"". Finally I made it. After a few recent burger dissapointments, this was going to be an awesome burger experience. I could taste a championship run.  This place would give Au Cheval and Lockdown (My faves to date) a run for their money. Maybe not a championship ring but a conference title appearance would be a strong possibility. The entrance was promising, a small place with a boutique feel. Step up to the counter and build - a- burger was the activity. The man at the counter walked me through it and wala my Grass-fed Burger on a pretzel bun with American Cheese, a fried egg, and some imported bacon was ordered. Oh, that Championship is getting closer, let me in the game coach. Ok that will $21.59?...Huh? $21.59? Ummm, ok let me call Uncle Phil in Beverly Hills to help me pay for this. So I sit my slowly widening behind on some of the few seats they have in there and hope coach puts me in the game.  After about 8-10 mins my burger comes out seperated in two parts by a stick. Ok so I assemble this masterpiece of meat and take a furious bite. Chomp, Nom nom nom. ""Houston we have a problem"". I didn't like it. So a few more bites to confirm. I still don't like. This was an extremely over seasoned-burger (chicago steakhouse seasoning) that was just too salty and it was only exacerbated by the saltiness of the bacon. This was an unpleasant burger to eat and our season is now going down the tubes. No championship,  no playoffs, no yelling we did it,  just dreams being flushed down the toilet. Only a week left in the season and coach finally puts me in. Let's just say I wasn't feeling it. In all seriousness I felt they were trying trying too hard to make their burger patties flavorful and delicious but got way too happy with their seasonings and they failed to properly integrate the seasonings into the meat. They completely destroyed the burger. No bun or even the runny  fried egg was going to save it. This place was supposed to do some damage and compete for a championship, instead self-inflicted wounds led to their downfall. You have ""Butcher"" in the name of the place, you cant possibly screw up a burger. My Friday Night was ruined because of my utter dissapointment, so I must give a poor rating of two stars. ""Next year will be the year""---Cubs fans"
Burger+fries+diet coke for $18. A tiny place and unfriendly staff. Do your self a favor go somewhere else. Nothing special about the burger.
"Solid burger, but I found the prices a bit high. I got the grass fed beef with umami spice topped with cheddar cheese as well as a side of cole slaw. I loved the extra touch of flavor the umami spice added to the burger, and the patty itself was very juicy and well done.However, I found that a lot of toppings I generally took for free with burgers, such as grilled onions, were extra charges, which would have quickly added up, especially given the relatively steep price of the base burger. Overall, a fantastic vibe with solid food, but prices were a little too steep for me to see myself coming again and again."
"For a place with burger in the title, the namesake was underwhelming.  Service and atmosphere was good, but the food didn't leave me wanting more any time soon.I'm sure the meat quality is very high, but for $9 the house beef blend wasn't impressive tastewise and the patty itself was small (1/3 pound-ish).  Skip the Chicago Steakhouse seasoning, I can't honestly say I know what this tastes like, or it is so subtle that anything else overpowers it.  The bun, tomato and lettuce are all fresh and taste great.  The BBQ sauce is very savory, better than ketchup on a burger.  The small size fry is quite large (which is nice since it makes up for a small burger size), and is average, not bad but not amazing.  They are thick, but not steak fries, best cut there is.  They have outdoor seating, which felt great with the 80 F and sunny weather we had today."
"Sunday Funday started with not setting the alarm clock. Followed by, cuddling with my puppy and hubby in bed until someone called me to get me motivated enough to shower. After a hot shower, drying my hair and learning that we are expecting more friggin snow today, I decided that we will not be grilling turkey burgers for lunch but instead going out for burgers.Everyone that is anyone, knows that I do not eat fast food if I can avoid it so if I'm going to have a burger anywhere, it's going to be a real burger joint, farm to table dining establishment or straight-up steakhouse!!My physical therapist and I were just talking last week about Kuma's corner and since he has never been, I started giving him shit about it. In return, he and I had a nice long discussion about other burger joints I need to try. Out comes my trusty Yelp app and 600+ reviews with 4 stars??? Yeah, Butcher and the Burger was bookmarked faster than that burger and fries hit me from Five Guys last year. No more Five Guys for this lady and if you're not hungover, I don't suggest it for you either!Go to Butcher and the Burger and eat a burger the way it's intended to be eaten. Served on a mini-butcher's block (aka cutting board), held together with a wooden spear (ok, it's really just a skewer but either way...), made with fresh ingredients and right off the grill. Build your own, pick something off the ""Favorites Menu"", try out Today's special or just get and large order of their fresh cut super delectable fries and a milkshake if you're a vegetarian. Trust me....no one will go hungry here.There were so many options, I think the hub's was a little overwhelmed so he chose the All American burger from the Favorites menu which is made with the House Blend Prime Beef burger with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, ketchup and mustard on a split-top bun. You even get to pick your own spice blends here!!! The All American burger is made with the Simple Blend (salt & pepper) but you could change it up if you so choose. There are a variety of spice blend options (take a peek at my photos to see the choices!)Since I'm a giant pain the ass, I built my own beautiful creation of a meal:Grass Fed Prime Beef burger seasoned with both the Simple (salt & pepper) and Chicago Style Steakhouse blends, Benton's Bacon from Tennessee, Cheddar cheese, lettuce, pickles, ketchup and mustard on a Whole Wheat, super fresh bun! We shared a large order of fries which was MORE than enough. A third or fourth person could have also been in on those with us!I snagged a nice cold Mexican Coke for my hubs and a Cream Soda for myself. Both the perfect beverages to accompany our meals. The restaurant: was SUPER clean. Even the bathrooms were impeccable.The service: I'm 50/50...I dealt with 2 people so that make's it really true. There was a very nice young lady that was very welcoming, friendly, and most importantly, knowledgeable. I loved her. She knew the menu and was able to kinda walk us through their menu board. I had no problem just telling her upfront that we have never been here so her tips and instructions were very kind. She pointed out where we could grab our drinks and made sure to point out the ""Today's Specials"" sign on the display case. The actual gentlemen that took our order could not have seemed less interested in being here today. I asked some questions and he mumbled something back at me. Kinda ruined my excitement about my burger. Luckily, the very kind young lady that we first met was the actual one that served our burgers to us and even checked back with us later to make sure we had everything we needed. Keep her BATB!!!! Her and the grass fed prime beef! We'll be back....for sure!"
"Yum! This was definitely a tasty burger! My friends and I stopped in here last Thursday for dinner and we were not disappointed! I ordered the house blend beef with the Chicago steakhouse spices on a whole wheat bun. I also got an order of the small fries (which were totally not small at all!). The burger was a little burnt, but it was still amazing. I think that speaks wonders about how tasty this food is. Normally I'm not a huge fan of customizable foods, because I never pick things that go well together, but this burger worked out really well. It was also massive and the fries are more than share-able.Oh by the way, this place is also BYOB!! Binny's is down the street so definitely hit that place up before coming here!I'll be back!"
"Yummy! You build your own burger, so you always get exactly what you want! I got the turkey burger on wheat with the basics, and it was HUGE and delicious. I think next time I would get my burger lettuce wrapped so I can eat all my fries. Definitely going back!"
"This review is for take-out only.I came here to pick up dinner this last Friday around 9pm and this place was busy but not too busy that there was a wait. I went straight to the counter and I was there for 5 minutes til someone greeted me. Employees have just passed me by without acknowledging me.Finally, I pulled out my credit card to get noticed that I was there for a pickup. Service is where I took off the 1 star.As far as food, it was an awesome burger. My hubby and I both got the house blend burger but I was more plain with just mozzarella and mushrooms and he got all the free fixins available lol.The fries were great too. They tasted like fresh cut potatoes, not frozen.I would give this place another try :)"
"A+ on the grub...but it kind of stops there. Butcher & The Burger is definitely at the top of my burger list. They serve up some meaty, juicy burgers customized to your liking. That's right. You pick the meat, the seasonings,  the bun, the condiments and the toppings. As a girl who loathes any restaurant that has ""no substitutions"" on their menu, this was right up my alley. I went with a bison burger with umami seasoning, a lettuce ""bun"" (no carbs for this chick), bbq sauce, goat cheese, pickles, avocado and tomato. It was the best $16 burger I've ever had.  So where did B&B go wrong? Well, my burger had to be made 3 separate times. Yes, three. I can forgive the first time when half the toppings I ordered were missing. However, when the second time rolls around and I cut into the burger to find it bleeding over half the table and it's legit cold in the middle, I kind of get a bad taste in my mouth. You guys make burgers for a living right?! That's wasn't anywhere close to ""medium"". Either way, the guy was apologetic and they fixed the order (each time) promptly. That's okay, I'm a forgiver. Anyhow, here's a few pointers and fun facts: - They have every meat under the sun, in burger form. Yes, they have a veggie burger too! - Most of their meat is grass fed which is a big A++ in my book. - The restaurant is tiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiny and it not suitable for a group more than 4. Unless you want to be ""those"" people who push all of their 6 tables together.- BYOB! - Although I didn't have one, the salads look amazing- Grab a size of homemade pickles, chips, or fries. Hell, grab one of each. Yes, they're THAT good.Overall, B&B had a couple of fumbles, but will I be back? In a heartbeat. I haven't had a burger that good in a long time."
"I love this burger joint. I've been here about four times and I have never been disappointed. The first time I went, I made the mistake of not choosing a seasoning blend which made the beef bland. I have no idea why I assumed that salt and pepper would be already used, but it makes sense that it would be offered as an option rather than a requirement because with the salt and pepper plus a seasoning blend could make the burger too salty? Anyways, I ended up asking for the ghost pepper seasoning on the side and my gosh, it was amazing. I was happy none-the-less.I always get the same burger: the local blend beef burger with the ghost pepper seasoning blend (caution: super hot and spicy, but it's so good!!), Swiss cheese, lettuce, fried egg, and avocado on a Whole Wheat bun. The only downside with this venue is that it's pretty small. The first time I had went was a Saturday night and it was packed. Basically, no tables available and a long line nearly out the door. It's no biggie because my boyfriend and I now go during the afternoon when it's not too busy. Even with this downside, I'm always excited and happy to eat at Butcher and The Burger!"
"Absolutely loved this place! Admittedly the ordering process is a little confusing because there's so much to choose from (what patty do I want, what about spices, the type of bun, add-ons...). Luckily came around 3p on a Saturday afternoon and while there were some folks already seated, we didn't have a line to wait in or people behind us pushing us through.Ordered the lentil patty with cheddar on the whole wheat bun with coleslaw as an add-on. That coleslaw was the best decision I've made in a long time. Asked for a side of wasabi-mayo... another great decision. Dunked my burger in the wasabi-mayo along with some fries and it honestly couldn't have been any better. My sister-in-law had the wasabi-mayo put directly on her burger and said there was too much, so think about asking for a side instead.Also tried the potato salad, which was good but could be skipped.For the burger, large fries and a drink you're looking at $17. Which is kind of crazy... but if you're looking to indulge yourself, go for it! Can't wait to take my husband here and try something else!"
"Small space. Huge burgers. When ordering you choose every aspect of how the burger is prepared - choose the type of meat (house blend, grassfed, etc), seasoning (multiple flavors and and levels of heat), bun, cheese, toppings, and extras (cost additional $).I met a friend here and ordered the grassfed (cooked medium), chicago seasoning, cheddar, split top, lettuce, tomato, mustard, mayo, pickle, onion. Side of  fries and a root beer.  The burger was cooked perfectly and extremely flavorful. The grassfed was lean, not too greasy. I enjoyed the fries as they are fried with partial skins. Add the root beer and I was content. Small, cozy space. Fast and friendly service. I'll be back. Total was around $18 and change, but the burger was damn good!"
"I was not impressed with this place at all. I had the grass fed burger that was suppose to be cooked medium. What I got was medium-rare to rare. The outside of the burger was charred and the middle looked and felt like steak tartare. Luckily, I like my steaks medium-rare and I do eat steak tartare, so I was okay with eating my burger that way. But for the price point of this place, I was surprised to see how off they were on the doneness of the patty. The bacon strips on my burger were also bad cuts. It was almost entirely all fat, so I just removed most of it. I finished the meal off with a beignet and, unfortunately, the dough was thick and chewy. Sad face. The fries were good and that's about it. I feel very ripped off."
"I decided that it was time to give B&B a try a few months ago, and have been back almost 20 times! This place is off the hook amazing. MInd you, it is expensive by the time you start adding premium toppings and sides, but the bacon is a must! BUT, you must ask for the bacon to be crispy, or it will be rubber. The pros:I have had the Chicago seasoning, as well as the Onion soup seasoning and both are wonderful. coleslaw: best I have ever had!potato salad: Very good, I think adding chopped egg would advance it further.great flavour in just about everything.The cons:expensive.It gets really crowded really fast, so go on off hours.the fries ALWAYS come out like several minutes after the burger arrives, I like fries WITH the burger - I mean who doesn't? B&B - I LUV YOU!"
I may have just eaten the best burger of my entire life. Simply perfect! You know when you see photos of a Big Mac and it looks absolutely perfect because it was photographed professionally but then you actually order one and it looks (and tastes) like roadkill? Well this place delivers perfect looking burgers that taste amazing. You can tell that pride went into making it and I can't recommend this place highly enough. So good!
AMAZING!!!  Perhaps one of the best burgers in the city.  This place is a true hidden gem.    The only drawback is it is small so you may have to wait for a seat if you come during prime time.
Food was ok. above average. i wouldnt spend $40 on two burger meals though. didnt amuse me
"It's been a few years so wanted to provide an update.  The burgers here are fantastic.  I love how they are simple and aren't on a gigantic pretzel bun like every other place in Chicago does it. The quality of the meat is really good, and their presentation here is perfection.  I love coming here to get a medium All American- it's perfect and this paired with the fries and a bottle of Coke make the perfect hangover lunch."
"Wow! If you're a burger fanatic like me then you must try this place. What I absolutely love is they place a heavy emphasis on the freshness of their meat and its easy to tell you are getting quality meat by the taste of their burgers. The burgers are not super over the top like Kumas, but the taste is just incredible. I also tried the fries and can say, hands down, they were perfect. Not overly greasy and very fresh and crispy. I would come by any day because this was one of the best burgers I ever had. I have to say, the only downside is that the restaurant is quite small, so when it gets crowded it becomes quite hectic and service gets slow, but honestly I'm not surprised this place gets crowded. It's too good to resist!"
"My fellow vegetarians - this is the way a veggie burger should taste. Totally customizable flavor wise. Seared and crisp on the outside and still not dried out on the inside! Honestly I think this may have been the best veggie burger I've had. The patty itself is vegan which is amazing and just like the rest of their burgers it is build your own from top to bottom. I mixed the umami and Cajun spices and it was very yum. Be warned, they do use lard in their fries but you CAN get them fried in plain vegetable oil if you ask. Keep it up B&B and you'll be seeing lots of me!"
First time going was a great experience will be back to try some other burgers had regular beef burger  an fries was a little over cook but it was still good an byob is always a plus
We saw this on food network and came all the way from Ohio to give this place a try and it was well worth it! We built our own burger and it was just everything we imagined!!!
"Adjectives: flavor customization, New Orleans-influenced, overcookedDish: Beef Blend w/ Cameron Parish Cajun Blend,Split Top Butter Egg, Goat Cheese This place is good if you really want to customize the taste of your burger, but it should not make a top 10 list of best burger places in the city. They have a very short list of burgers, but offer a full menu of spices and toppings to customize your burger. My personal preference is for them to suggest interesting flavor combinations (like Kuma or Umani Burger joints). My Turkey burger was overcooked and came out dry, so I would have rather gotten the beef burger and done some extra jumping jacks.They also have Cafe Du Monde chicory coffee and beignets.  They are a tasty brunch snack, but the beignets don't have the light and freshly made quality that the beignets at the actual Cafe Du Monde in New Orleans does (high standards!)."
Came for lunch with friends. Great food! Loved our burgers. The truffle mayo is heaven sent. Mark is a gem-- works magic on the grill!
"It doesn't matter how good the burger tastes if I order it medium and it comes out well-done. That's just weak sauce amateur hour nonsense that I would not expect from a so-called burger specialist. And since I'm nitpicking, the ""simple"" seasoned burger didn't taste that good because it was over-salted. So really my burger wasn't all that great. The fries, however, now that's a different story."
"This place is awesome!! You order your burger (and other stuff) at the counter and you get to pick your meat, your spice, your bun, your condiments and other toppings. I got the house beef blend with Cajun seasoning on a pretzel bun along with lettuce, tomato, American cheese, Sriracha mayo and avocado. Also shared an order of fries with my girlfriend. Burger was delicious! Fries were delicious! I really want to come back and try more combinations! They have some preselected options if you're worried about picking everything yourself. The spices aren't too strong in the meat so don't worry about that so much. The guys working were also super friendly and struck up a nice conversation when they came around to see how you were doing. Great place, highly recommend it!"
"Gotta love BYOB and BYOB (build your own burger). My last trip to Butcher and the Burger was with a friend on 4th of July because burgers and America. We came armed with our Stiegl radlers (ok not American) and had a great time. I had the surf special, which is a shrimp burger with avocado, other fixins, and some awesome glaze sauce and she had the good old American burger. Both were really awesome. I also loved the purple potato salad (on special). We ended the meal with some beignets - whoa. Keep in mind they are giant compared to other beignets so you only need one or two per person. They are delicious, though. Other trips here I've had the salmon burger and the bison burger, which were also amazing. I love being able to pick your own meat seasoning, bun, and toppings so the possibilities here are endless. The folks working in there are also super friendly and helpful. Only reason I don't give them 5 stars is it's a little small so the seating situation isn't great, especially when people don't just eat and leave. And it is crowded a good amount of the time since it's so excellent.  But I'm already imagining new burger combos for my next trip here!"
"I was determined to find a place that offers a decently priced butcher class in Chicago for my boyfriend's birthday gift. I searched high and low for several months (seriously, none of the butcher shops offer them) and landed on Butcher & The Burger (The Butcher & Larder offers classes sporadically...but at a REALLY HIGH price).After attending the class at B&B, I can't say enough good things! There were 6 of us total that took the class--it was very casual and laid back, and Chef Allen taught us so much! We broke down half a hog (she was 79 lbs and freshly slaughtered the day prior, arriving from a farm in mid-state Illinois), learning all about the various cuts of the animal and helpful hints for butchering and cooking at home. While the class wasn't 100% hands on, Chef was open to anyone giving something a try if they wanted to.You are definitely up close and personal with the hog, so this class is not for the squeamish or faint of heart. The class lasted about 2 and a half hours and is held in the basement of Butcher & The Burger (bonus, it is BYOB!). Chef Allen will also sell you any of the pork cuts at a really great price. The class includes a burger post-butchering with their delicious fries and truffle dipping sauce. The burgers were outstanding--so juicy and tender, cooked to perfection. Their menu is a little overwhelming with so many toppings to choose, so it's good to go in with an idea of what you'd like to order. The restaurant is also pretty small, but we were there late on a Wednesday night so we had no problems finding a seat (although I can imagine it gets pretty packed around dinner). There is also an a la card to this restaurant that I have yet to use, so I will definitely be back soon!"
"Great burgers and fries! Outdoor seating available; cordial service; You select your choice of meat, toppings, bread, spices, cheeses, drinks, and it is sent out to your table. Bison burger, backyard bbq spices, fried egg, lettuce/tomatoes/onions cooked med-rare: incredibly good, and perfectly portioned. All American beef burger, bbq spices, avocado, cheese, tomato, fried egg, onions, ketchup: perfectly hit the spot!Large order of fries (good for 3, but 2 could finish the job): too good and addictive! 2 burgers with water will run you $40 exact. A bit much, but was worth the splurge, nonetheless."
"BreakfastSplit two of the breakfast sandwiches ($6.95 each) with a girlfriend. The croissants were perfect, the smoked salmon was pretty good but the sausage on the Homemade Pork Sausage sandwich was so salty and over spiced, I could not even eat it. The last time I didn't clean my plate was 1983.Service was not overly friendly or helpful, so other than the cute decor I'm not sure I see a redeeming quality in Butcher & The Burger."
"Amazing staff and cooks! Fast and fresh! I had a Bison Burger with BBQ sauce, sautéed onions, and Goat cheese, on a pretzel bun. Sooooo GOOD!"
"This place is located super close to my boyfriends work and we decided to check it out because everyone was raving about it.  It's a small but cute corner spot that serves great burgers.  You can really tell that they use high quality and local ingredients.  The staff was really friendly but also passionate about their food.  Although I am not a biggest fan of burgers in general, next time I am craving one, this will definitely be the spot to go."
"I should've taken a photo before i monstrously ate that whole burger. Review based on what I ate and service for to-go.Burger: Houseblend, med/well, cheddar, bacon, fried egg, grilled onions and Chicago spice. -- The egg made it messy (obvi), but burger was delish!!!!! The charred taste on that burger... Mmmmm.... 5 stars.Fries: eh, eat it while it's super fresh!! 3.5 starsServer was awesome and gave a precise recommendation. There was an older man there, Caucasian, casually walking around and talking gossip to employees. I can only guess he's the manager/owner. He made things awkward, just walking around and staring, without any type of welcoming gesture or exchange of words as we/customers pass by him.Came around 1:30p and place was packed, but of course place is also super tiny, so to-go is the way to go. I recommend this place."
"Everything was great, the decor, the staff and most importantly the food. Had the grass fed beef with cheddar, Sriracha mayo and pork belly...only bad thing was that I didn't order a double. I will most assuredly trek back to Lincoln Park for the burgers here and might just splurge on one of their vintage coolers next time."
"I was surprised upon entering the restaurant at how small the seating area is. I can easily see when it's busy it would be difficult to get in and out.  I would say the lack of tables is the only downside to this establishment.When you order a burger you get to choose from a wide variety of meats and spices. They then cook the burger to your liking. I will say this was Very literally the BEST burger I've ever had! The seasoning was perfect and the meat was cooked as requested.  I didn't order any sides so I can't comment on them, maybe next time. Another thing that was interesting is the New Orleans beignet mix lining the walls. This was the last thing I expected to see in a Chicago restaurant! I asked the manager, who had come to check on us, if the owner is from New Orleans. He's not, but he has a love for the city, hence beignets are served in his restaurant. Being from New Orleans, and having just arrived in Chicago the same morning I visited Butcher & the Burger I was not home sick enough to order the beignets.  I do think it's a cool idea to have this nostalgic item served in a restaurant frequented by people who may have never been to New Orleans. Overall the service was good, and the food was great. I would visit again in a heartbeat when I return to Chicago!"
Oh sweet B & BYou have been so good to me Especially fries.  A haiku review from us to you ™
"I love this place. Not only is it BYOB but the atmosphere is great. You choose your meat, seasoning, cheese and any other toppings. Best burger I've had in a long time!!!"
"Very solid burger place. Came here with my gf and her sister and right off the bat you notice how tiny the place is. But whatever you came here for the food right? They have grass fed beef which is a huge plus for me and they have so many ways to add a flavor kick to it while it's cooking. I got the asian style on the whole wheat bun and the fries. They cooked the burger perfectly for me, I like my burgers rare and they put a nice crust on the outside while the inside was perfect. The fries were also very good. I mean what can I say, if you want a good burger and don't want to be let down come here. I know I will"
"A few things to keep in mind: its a rather small place, its in a great location near the L and Armitage and they have really good food.  What that means is that there will be wait to order and it will be crowded.Stopped by on a whim Saturday night and it was crowded.  We however, showed up at the right time (7:00) because shortly after we ordered the line was out of the door.  We also stumbled in on a night where they had a guest chef from Jackson, MS working the line and cooking his specialty burger.I ordered Tom's Mississippi Special burger which was a steak/pork mixture patty, bacon jam, spicy aioli and root beer collard greens.  The burger was cooked to perfection, in fact it was still dripping when it made to me!  One of the juiciest burgers I have had in Chicago and tastiest.  To boot the fries are killer as well.    Overall, great small nieghborhood vibe and fantastic burgers.  This will be a place that I will visit on multiple occasions!"
"Outstanding burger, amongst the best in the cityFlavorful, cooked well and delicious2 burgers and fries sets you back about $24, but you can tell the ingredients are qualityBurgers on the small side, hearty eaters will not leave stuffed"
"That burger was pretty damn good, I got a grass-fed burger (which really is the only way to order a burger these days) and added an egg too, I went all out this time. I wouldn't order it with an egg the next time, I'd rather stick to a good ol' fashion cheeseburger. The fries were pretty salty so I'd recommend asking them before to have a steady had when seasoning with salt. The beignets were good but very doughy, felt more like I was eating a sweet bread then a fried lightly air filled donut, if that makes any sense. I would definitely recommend this place to my friends and if you live in the area your one lucky SOB. The service was also fantastic."
"One word Beignets. They sell beignets here. But thats just a plus. The burgers are fantastic. They have a grill char on them. And the patty size is appreciated. You get to choose everything from seasoning to bun. You choose meat, cheese, bread, seasoning, toppings and sides. I love it and cant wait to return."
I dream about these burgers. So good! I love how they have the different spice rubs and variations that you can specialize for your own tastes. Great spot! Only thing is - it is byob which is difficult when there is no liquor stores around and all you want is a beer to go with burger. But definitely worth a try if you are a burger fan!
"Totally enjoyed this place. Easy to find. Not a lot of seating, but it's about the food. On with the food. The menu was a little overwhelming. You have a lot of choices so as a first time patron, I asked what to get that summarizes the burger experience. The staff was very kind and helped. I ended up getting a basic burger (it may have been called , The All American (it's been a while as I have just added this app). I had it medium rare, with coleslaw and a duck egg. It was incredible. Perfectly cooked. You could taste the beef and with the extras on it, it was a great eating experience. I would recommend it if in the area and you are up for a different burger experience. They have burgers you can order, but that is not the experience you should have when fully enjoying this place. You start with selections of meat, seasonings for the meat, toppings and bun. Each section has a few to many choices. I would check out their menu on the ride over, otherwise you may end up overwhelmed. The prices are more than sonic or your typical burger joint, but you are getting a quality product. If in the area, I would definitely go back if I wanted a burger."
"My sister, husband and I stopped by this burger place for lunch on a Friday afternoon. I had really high expectations for a place that seems to specialize in delicious burgers, since they have burger in their name for crying out loud. What a disappointment. After paying 65$ for 3 burgers and 3 drinks, we sat down and waited for our burgers. After 10-15 min our burgers came and I was expecting something out of this world! All I got was a burnt tasting burger that was mediocre at best. I've had better burgers made by my husband and better burgers that were more than half the price. The service was good, but other than that this place was blah. Such a huge waste of money."
"Sure, we waited 30 minutes on the line to order our burgers. Sure, we waited another 30 minutes to finally get our burgers. IT WAS ALL WORTH IT. Top 3 burgers of my life. And I've had a lot of burgers. You choose your meat -- I chose house prime blend, medium rare. Then you choose your spice -- I chose Grandma's onion soup. Then you add your cheeses, foie gras, truffle, mushrooms, whatever extra toppings you want -- I added an egg. AMAZING. Of course, you might have to fight for a seat."
"Order a burger at the register, wait briefly for it to come up, put it in your mouth immediately, and punch anyone who prevents you from doing so.I'd say B&TB offers one of the best burgers I've ever had, because their patties themselves are so high-quality and delicious that they don't need to add a bunch of condiments, toppings, and everything but the kitchen sink to make this a masterpiece. I took some visiting friends from NY here and they said it was one of the best meals they've ever had. And they've been eating meals for a long time.My recommendations: don't get it cooked more than medium rare. The cajun spice is mouthwatering. Get the fries with a side of truffle mayo. I personally would take it easy on extra toppings - focus on the beef, taste the beef, love the beef. This is getting weird. Just go here."
"My friend and I were looking for burgers on a Friday evening.  First timers and we will be back.   Prices slightly on pricier side but worth it.  Highly recommend over DMK, where burgers are $$, small, and not tasty.  This place you can customize your burger. They have different types of meats or vegan options, spices/spice rubs, toppings.   We order a turkey and beef burger.  Went to the little outdoor seating area to enjoy the burgers.  PRO: Friendly staff, good food  Con: limited indoor seating"
"Yesterday I reviewed this place at 2 stars because I had paid fifteen dollars for an overly salty hamburger. Well, it turns out that it was the caramelized onions I had on there that were the culprit. Stay away from them.You see, my wife, unbeknownst to me, had half a burger leftover from last night. And she decided to scrape off the onions and give me a few bites. Man oh man! Now THIS is a fifteen dollar burger! Everything on it was so tasty now that the onions were off. It was cooked perfectly, and something I'd definitely go back for.I still wish that they had a few specialty burgers that they could recommend. As a chef, you taste your food, you know what goes good together. They need to share that knowledge with their customers. They do give you a wealth of options to customize your burger, but since each place is different, it's hard to tell what's actually going to taste good. For example, most burger places don't have salty caramelized onions. I will be coming back here."
My burger tasted like any other burger. Yet it cost $9 and didn't come with fries or a drink.
"Butcher & The Burger is trendy and pricey, but they make a great burger. I really like that you can pick a spice blend (or two, or three!) to go in your patty. The desert chili spice blend is killer! My only ""beef"" is that they have a sign that claims: we cook our burgers like steaks...rare is cold, pink center....etc. I ordered a medium well burger based on this description, but was served a well done burger. If you're going to have a big sign explaining how you cook things, then you should probably cook them the way you advertise...Just a thought.I don't come here often because of the overpriced menu, but burger lovers should definitely give it a try."
"I had had this place bookmarked for ages and had never gotten around to going. If only I had known what I was missing! Came here with a friend a few nights ago about an hour before they closed (I know, I know) and the restaurant was still full. It is VERY teeny. Also, it's not full service - you walk up to order your burger and then they bring it out to you. We walked up to order and I was immediately overwhelmed by all of the amazing options you have! Like a zillion types of proteins, seasonings, cheeses, toppings, and buns. Hellooooo, customization! I was almost overwhelmed by the choices - but I somehow managed.I got the ""prime"" beef, their house blend of meaty goodness, with the Chicago steakhouse seasoning, cheddar cheese, a fried egg, on a pretzel bun. Friend got the prime with Sahara dessert seasoning, mozzarella, ketchup/mayo. We shared an order of large fries, found a table, and waited with anticipation.Holy DELICIOUSNESS. The burger is the PERFECT size (not the standard ridiculous jumbo coma inducer) and so juicy, fresh, and amazing. It's cooked EXACTLY to order (how refreshing to actually eat medium RARE beef!) and the fried egg on top was the perfect accompaniment. To be honest, I didn't taste a whole lot of the steakhouse seasoning, but it certainly didn't make it worse. Friend loved his burger too, and definitely tasted his seasoning - 'twas spicy!The fries were boooomb - skin on, thick cut, COVERED in sea salt perfection. Because we hadn't had our fill of gluttony, we ordered two frozen custards - we asked for two chocolate, but got a chocolate and vanilla, and it was delightful. The vanilla wasn't awesome, but the texture of both were fantastic. The staff were fun, young, and helpful. This place is where it's AT for burgers, and I appreciate the unique angle they're rockin - instead of piling a burger with wacky toppings, make an amazing, quality meat product, and let toppings accessorize the amazitude. Well worth the trip to Lincoln Park!"
"It's my second time here and I couldn't wait to make the 20 mile haul from the Southside to Lincoln Park. I say that because my last time here this place left a WOW Factor on the best part of my taste buds!FreshnessBack Yard BBQ taste and someThe right breadToppingsUnique Drinks and Fresh LemonadeAwesome Coleslaw Great Fries (in Vegan Oil? If you choose)EVERYTHING WAS GREAT UNTIL....We came back! I hyped up this place to everybody that they just wanted to get here like yesterday and it's just wasn't the same. I came here hungrier than ever and all I got was great sides. But the star of the show; the different burgers... ALL BURNT and we asked for ""Medium-Plus/Medium Well"", NOT CHARRED until the bark is bitter and inedible. It's too bad, because I hate when a place loses its WOW FACTOR!I'll probably still go back since I had a GREAT 1st experience and since the sides and customer service were right on both times."
"HIM: Where do you want to grab dinner?ME: Butcher & BurgerHIM: (giving me a quizzical look) Really?ME: Yes, really.Why was B&tB such a weird suggestion on my part? Well, I don't eat beef, haven't for decades and not intending to start now. Kudos to B&tB for having a menu that can accommodate just about any dietary preference; it got me in the door. In addition to red meat, there are lentil (vegan), turkey, salmon, and shrimp burger options.When we pulled up to B&tB, I put 1.5 hours on the meter and immediately regretted it. I figured we'd be in and out in under an hour - boy was I wrong. The place was hopping when we arrived; it's BYOB and there were lots of tables downing burgers and brews. The inside seating area is small; there are about 6-7 tables and counter space; larger parties can easily leave orphan tables (tables without chairs) in the already limited space. Fortunately, there's a cute outdoor patio in warmer months, but be forewarned, alcohol isn't allowed outside.He ordered the bison burger and me the shrimp burger. You can choose seasonings, bun and toppings or go with one of our their pre-selected combos; we did that, otherwise it's a bit overwhelming. We also got an order of large fries and intended to split a shake, but their machine was broken. Our total came to $33, which seemed high to me, but what do I know, I don't order burgers, so that might be totally reasonable. We headed out to the patio to wait for our food.And wait we did. We waited and waited and waited. We started noticing people sit, eat and leave while we languished on the patio. When my manfried went in to inquire, he learned our order was lost and someone would be out to re-take our order. Again we waited and waited and waited. When no one showed up to take our order, he went in again; they found our ticket and were remaking the order. When our food did come, they forgot the fries; we had to ask two times to finally get them. Both of our burgers were also wrong; right burgers, wrong preparation with his coming out closer to well done than medium rare (kind of a big deal to carnivores I'm told). We were both so hungry, we kept our mouths shut and ate them. Eventually, someone popped by to apologize for the delay.When we finally got our food, it was good, not fantastic or outstanding; the abysmal service will definitely make us think twice about a return visit. When we left, we were 10 minutes shy of our meter running out. To recap, approximately 30 minutes of our meal was spent waiting in line to order and actually eating; the other 50 was spend waiting. To add insult to injury, manfriend later discovered he was shorted on change from our tab, so we actually paid even more for the less than stellar experience.Bottom line: It's rare to find a burger place that caters to so many eating habits; what's disappointing is that it wasn't better."
"Great environment. Fun selection. A bit on the pricey side, but for good reason."
"This place was awesome! I love the way they were playing classical music loud to help avoid the sense of chaos on how busy it was in there. I had the Angus burger with black truffle oil mayo, it was delicious! I'd highly recommend this cute neighbor burger joint!"
"I was excited to try this place since burgers are a top fav food of mine. I'm always looking for the next best burger in Chicago. It was interesting to see this unique style of customize ordering although I wasn't entirely pleased with the flow of it all. First off, it is a tight spot with one register and a large chalkboard with only a million burger options that requires you to pick ever single thing on the burger from the type of protein (beef, chicken, salmon, turkey, pork, alien (jk), ect....) to the the seasoning, and then don't forget the gajillion toppings, cheeses, more toppings, sides, desserts... It's overwhelming, so be prepared when you get up there to order. PROS: I ordered a House Blend beef burger cooked medium well with Chicago steakhouse seasoning, swiss, lettuce, tomato, onion, smoked bacon, mayo, and ketchup on a split top bun. It was absolutely delicious. The fries were amazing! I will definitely be back, but maybe when it's not busy. Also, the dude at the counter was really nice and helpful. CONS:I didn't like that people were fighting for places to sit, granted I was there on a Saturday afternoon but still, it was wild in there. I also did not like the way the food ""runner"" yelled people's name when their order was ready, they could definitely figure out a better system that isn't so obnoxious. I understand that they are going for a ""craft-fast food diner-ish"" thing but it didn't work well. Even though we ordered at the counter and did not have a server, the order still took well over a 20 minutes and we had to anxiously sit and wait for our name to be called.Then my boyfriend had to awkwardly make his way over past the counter, veering through hungry people waiting in that long line to pick up our food and make his way back, burgers intact.  Did not dig it very much. All in all, great burger. I'm sure I'll be back soon!"
"One of the best burgers I've ever had. The burgers are very easily customized and the many options allows you to venture into the unchartered (e.g. bison), or stay traditional. Choose your blend of meat, spice rub, cheese, bun, and toppings. I got the house beef blend, egg bun, American cheese, carmelized onions, fried egg (+$1),  avocado (+$1), mayo, and steakhouse spice rub. The house blend beef patty was extremely juicy and flavorful. You can really taste the full beef/steak flavor. Opting for the fried egg is a must-do essential. Be warned: the juices will flow and it will get messy. The fries are huge (more than enough for one) and they were soft on the inside and ultra crispy on the outside. Only comment is there was too much salt on mine.Watch out for the lines. It takes time for each person to order at the front and the restaurant's space is small. Otherwise you need to try this place if you are a gourmet burger fan."
"Good, But Nothing Special.PROS:-Lots of build your own burger options-Premium meatCONS:-Boring fries-Overpowering flavor in shakes (vanilla tastes like drinking straight vanilla extract)"
"Totally delicious. Got the James Beard, and it was dope. Fries were yummy. Vibes in the place are sweet. Byob is pretty cool too."
"For me, this and Etno's (tied) is better than DMK which is better than Kuma's. Yes, the wait is long but worth it, especially if it is your first time. Staff is very nice and helpful though. Tip: pre-order and just pick up (jump the line, and just go to the side counter). I also just love the simplicity of the build-your-own burgers.The shrimp burger is really good and abundant in shrimp flavor. Obvious spice blend is the umami. Most people like it, but it is a tad sweet and teriyaki-like for my tasting, but still really good. I've also had the lentil burger with grandma's onion soup. The patty itself and spice blend was very tasty, but was somewhat falling apart, as with most homemade veggie patties.Why the 1 star dock: I've ordered the grass-fed beef a few times now as medium. However, the cook on it has been inconsistent from medium-rare to nearly well-done. For some, this may be more stars docked, but the flavors and quality of all their ingredients can't be beat. The burger meets sun blend had a nice heat profile for me, while I found the cajun and sonora desert chili spices to be less memorable."
"Man this place was phenomenal. BYOB in two regards, you can build your own burger and bring your own booze. Burgers range from all types; beef, buffalo, salmon, turkey, crab(different but still potentially awesome) and all natural/grass fed beef. On top of that, there are about 7 different types of seasonings you can add to the burger, which you can also buy a jar of. And then there are a slew of all different types of toppings, cheeses, condiments(black truffle mayo, sriracha mayo, BBQ, etc), bacons, foie gras and almost anything else you can imagine. Not to mention, they serve a whole bunch of breakfast sandwiches!Also, coffee, beignets and home made custard. Service was good too. All in all, I'll definitely be back and will recommend it to anyone looking for a good burger. And, on top o all that - they have butcher classes where you can learn how to butcher different types of animals."
"I am really loving this Hamburger craze that is going on.  Granted, you can make em at home, granted, there's only so much you can do with a burger and granted, it is pretty hard to screw up a hamburger ... but there are places, and this is one of them, that get it really right.  Not a humungous patty, but done right, well seasoned, cooked, and since you can top it how you want, topped.  Fries were very good, comes on a cutting board, can turn into a knife and fork affair if you get toppings that slide.  BYOB will have wife and I return better prepared."
"HIGHLY RECOMMEND: This place popped up as a suggestion for dinner and the chef at my work said its amazing and to definitely try it.  So four of us went to try it and the main guy there was so awesome and helpful on teaching us how the menu works (without being snobby that we were first timers -that you get at other places) I love how you order your meat and pick your seasoning they cook it with then choose your bun and toppings.  It's such a cool idea.I got a house blend burger (super juicy and cooked to exactly medium) with the backwoods game seasoning in a lettuce bun/wrap with goat cheese and tomatoes.  SO SO SO SO quick and deliciously satisfying.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it.  We also got an order of fries-small order feeds two people-and then tried the beignets in both powdered sugar and cinnamon sugar (I preferred the cinnamon sugar) Everything came out very quickly and even though the place is quite small, we didn't have to wait too long to snag a table before ordering (we were there a Friday around 7:30-8ish).  I highly recommend this place for dinner, but not for a large group.  Also its BYOB so pick up a 6 pack at the 7/11 right around the corner !"
"Chicago was recently raved as the #01 city was burgers. 90% of that is because of Butcher and the Burger.  The bison burger on top of a croissant is out of this world, especially when paired with the fries and BACON custard. Go ahead. Indulge a little."
"$10 burger served up chipotle style.   Pick your bun (split/pretzel/etc), pick your meat (ground/bison/etc), pick your seasoning..etcDid I mention it's a $10 burger.  So for that kind of jack, it better be better.  And (yay!) it is.  Served up on a cutting board with a humongous toothpick through it (?) it's really quite good. I had a taste of the meat all by itself and was thinking its a shame how that pure deliciousness is obscured by the bun and ketchup and what not.    A couple of those patties all by themselves would be aces.  Maybe next time I'll order two burgers, no ketchup, hold the bun between your kneesyoutube.com/watch?v=6wtf…"
"Got the all-American and found it very satisfying. Burger was juicy and was wonderfully charred on the outside. It's ok to get a bit messy while eating because it was so good! I would skip the mushroom topping next time though coz it was so watery it made the bun soggy. Fries were good too! Tiny place, so come during off hours or be prepared to wait."
"I moved near here a year ago and you know, I'd really like to love this place, but I can't get into it that much. I've been about four times now.It's good food, no doubt about it, but I usually end up leaving the place with a like $20+ bill for a 6oz burger and whatever side(s). I am quite happy that they sell grass-fed beef and other meats, but considering that the place is a counter-order/cafeteria kinda joint, I'm not about to just casually walk in there for a $20 burger meal, even considering the quality of the burger.I just can't get behind the wholeness of the restaurant conceptually. I like things about it, but I don't see how it all fits together, except that it's in Lincoln Park, I guess.Anyway, the food quality is pretty good, the staff is great, and the patio is cool too. I just think it's overtly over-priced for the overall experience. And I'm not itchin' to go back any time soon after the four times I've given it to persuade me otherwise."
"I will gladly pay another $15 for a custom grass-fed burger at B&B because they do it right.I haven't had a good burger for a long, long time. Unfortunately, I'm most often left disappointed after trying the latest ""best of _"" burger. Thank you, B&B, for giving me hope!I chose a grass-fed beef patty on a pretzel bun, with bleu cheese, bacon, lettuce, onion and tomato. Not too basic, yet simple enough to shine. The patty was a juicy medium-rare, per my request, and encased by a flavorful seared crust. The pretzel bun was soft but sturdy enough to hold the massive burger together. The bun sopped up the meaty beefy drippings without succumbing to sogginess. The tomato slice was blood red ripe. The creamy bleu cheese had melted and evenly coated the fresh slices of lettuce. The onion was sliced thinly, allowing it to add a refreshing crunch to the burger instead of an overpowering bitterness. Perfection.Do get the truffle mayo. I despise mayo. I find it revolting. Yet, B&B's truffle mayo is, I believe, a thick, house-made concoction that is loaded with truffle. Smother your burger with it, or drench your fries in it. It is the most satisfying mayo you will ever have.Also, wonderful service. The guys here are sweet and check up on your meal in a loving, not annoying way."
"Oh man. I've come here several times since moving to Lincoln Park over the summer and I've loved it every time! So many delicious mix and match options, this is an expensive burger that is more than worth it. The fries are a cut above (forgive the intended pun) and the custard is delicious! Lemonade is eh but the burger itself is so outstanding!I don't understand the reviews that say this place is pretentious. I come there in my sweatpants and baseball cap, sometimes with a two year old in tow, and I get nothing but gracious and helpful service. I will say, though, that I usually go midday and never after 530pm. The manager (owner?) will go up to each table to ask if they need anything and if they enjoyed their meal, just awesome service.If you want a burger (beef, turkey, veggie, salmon, shrimp, so many options!) with great add ons and sides, come here!"
"So damn good.  Worth consideration for Chicago's best burger.You are the captain of your fate at Butcher & the Burger.  Select your meat and your seasoning and your bun and your toppings.  Then, stand back while the magic happens.The burger is big and juicy.  The fries are cooked to perfection.  This is exactly what you crave.It loses one star because there's virtually zero seating.  Miss out on the handful of seats around tables and you'll be squished against the counter while servers try to squeeze past you and the line of customers.It's also really expensive, but the quality can justify that price every so often."
"After lunch at Butcher & The Burger this past weekend, I have 4 options:1. Figure out how to mainline that badboy blue cheese with Chicago seasoning2. Franchise a store in my basement, invitation only3. Start a Butcher & The Burger Anonymous and live day to day until the next time4. Find something better - NOT.Lots of outstanding burger places around the country (Thrillist does a nice job featuring lots of places in lots of cities)....however, this is the only place that will make you cry and laugh and drool and shamelessly steal food off your neighbors' plates."
UPDATE!! Service is the most important thing for me... After posting my review the owner reached out to me via Yelp and offered to buy me another lunch!?! This is someone who values their customers and I was very impressed by the gesture... This just moved him to 5 Stars in my book and I'll be back soon :)I'm not sure when it happened but I have officially become a burger snob!! I mean their are just soooo many great options in the city like Kuma's & Lockdown that you can't help but be picky.So here's my review... first it's worth noting that I had my fresh made burger brought to my table within 10mins of ordering so in that fashion they beat the other 2 burger joints I just mentioned as they take anywhere from 30mins to a hour. As for the burger the patty is chard which adds tons of flavor if you like that but other then that it's not very memorable. The bacon is a little soggy so I'd suggest they crisp it up if u add it.The highlight for me absolutely is the Truffle Mayo & Fries!! Absolutely Amazing combination that completely caught me off guard and would definetly be the reason I'd come back. Not that the burger was bad but for a $20 lunch I think they're better options including Epic Burger.
"Service: You order up at the register, like a fast food place and they will come find you. Hard to judge service.Ambience: Good to go with a friend or two. Seating can be an issue for larger groups. They have a cute patio that is SUPER nice. Food: If you love burgers, you must try everything on the menu! Simple as that.  Cost: A little bit on the pricier side, but the quality of the food is worth it. Overall: I'm basically going to become a regular, it's that amazing."
One of the best burgers I've had. (At least when I was there) there was an older man taking orders who is the manifestation of the word 'great customer service'.
"Do you like backyard burgers on the grill?  Do you like paying over $10 a piece for a backyard burger on the grill?  I think many of you would would have said yes to the first question and no to the second question.  Well if you answered no to the second one at least, you sure as hell will not want to frequent this establishment, as I no longer will after my first and last visit.  This place is great for someone that can't cook on the grill or doesn't know anyone that can cook on the grill.  I wonder how many of these high reviews I see are from people that can't cook on the grill or know a soul that can cook a decent burger on the grill.  See I grew up with good quality burgers on the grill, so my standards are a little as they should be when it comes to reviewing a raved about place such as this.Over the weekend I was out on an adventure up to the beautiful Lincoln Park neighborhood to cross off another Chicago burger restaurant that was sitting on the top 20 burger lists for Chicago.  You see the lists are often comprised of mulitple journalists, so there you have it, probably the writer for this place lives around here and shows favoritism because I was beyond shocked this place made it big based upon what I experienced.Well as we approached the corner of Kenmore and Armitage on a Saturday evening at 5:30 P.M. we were expecting to see at least a halfway decent line of people and seats taken; however, that was not the case, it was quite empty and now I know why.The manager or owner was super friendly and helpful as he right away greeted us and explained the menu which was a good thing because it was somewhat difficult to read.  Especially how they show the grass fed beef burger with a little arrow pointing to ""kid size"" right below it.  Me and my brother both were thinking it was reading kid size until we took another double take then saw ""5.00"" next to the ""kid size,"" oooh I see, if you down grade to kid size burger the price falls to $5.  Also the french fries were not on the menu which was weird.  We also chuckled about how the cole slaw sign and potato salad sign was switched in the display case, ok time to stop being mean.Any way I ordered the beef burger with goat cheese and onion and the Chicago style spices on the meat, along with the potato salad and the fries.  Right away I was given a scoop of the potato salad from the display case and my cup for water.  I sat down and began chowing on the $2.95 cup of potato salad.  It was good and creamy, and tasted just like my brother's homemade potato salad, we pointed that out and chuckled.  I felt like we were at a family BBQ and someone brought a really good but easily prepared potato salad.  It was no big deal and not unique like it should be in a restaurant.We got our burgers next and I got my fries.  I asked for my burger medium rare and in some spots it was medium WELL and other spots it seemed kinda raw like, definately not evenly cooked.  The goat cheese was real creamy but overpowering.  There were also way too many onions stacked on there, so I picked some off, my brother had the same observations.  He also had bacon on his which he said was way too smokey.  The burger was bland and primitivly cooked just like a backyard burger.  The spices did nothing to enhance the flavor at all, it was a bland experience jsut like a.......you got it......a backyard burger!  Burgers are very simple to make yet very difficult.  If you want to make an award winning burger you better get some high tech equipment and cook it just right.  I do not know if they own the fancy equipment like most top quality burger joints use in Chicago, but my guess is no, and if so they sure do not know how to use it.  The fries were kinda hard and oversalted.  The fries were not soaked in salt water before the frying process which makes them came out kinda tough, I thought they would know better.  The fries also costs $2.95 for a small order.  This place is disappointingly highly overrated and the food made me feel like crap afterward just like a backyard burger does.  Whenever I eat at the top burger joints in Chicago (besides this one) I do not get that sickly feeling in my gut, but here I did, which means this is equal to a BACKYARD BURGER.  I apologize for being repetitive about ""backyard burger"" but I was pissed I wasted $16.80 on something I can make at home, what a waste of time, money, and comfort in my gut afterward.  I gave three stars because the quality of the meat is still good quality, and if one was to buy their meat to grill (which is an option) it would be ideal.  Three stars MINUS for this place"
"I never really order burgers when I go out. Burgers (for me) are like eggs. They are personal and political. I have a very specific idea as to what makes a good burger and I can usually do it better myself at home.THESE TASTE JUST LIKE YOU MADE THEM YOURSELF! I mean this as a compliment. I know people geek out over Au Cheval and that's a good burger too but we are talking 2 different styles. This is a CLASSIC thick and most burger with the perfect maillard reaction rapped around it. They have a custom grill back there and they are doin' it right. As a Southerner I was thrilled to see Chicory coffee and beignets as well. They also offer butchery classes. Allen Sternweiler is the owner and he graciously shook my hand and took some time with me. This is a Chef in every since of the word making something simple....well. I wish him the best of luck. Just looking at the menu option he is sourcing the best quality Foie Gras, bacon and beef. His passion and attention to detail are all present on the plate. This is hands down the best burger I have had the pleasure of wolfing down in all of Chi-town."
"Service was great at 11:30 am on a weekday- cashier took his time explaining everything to my group so we could make good choices. I had the grass fed beef with Chicago seasoning, caramelized onions, cheese and mustard and it was very good. The toppings over-floweth. The grass-fed beef is a leaner option than their other, but still quite tasty. Fries can be ordered vegan. Truffle mayo was excellent.  Lots of variety to try so seems like a place that won't get boring any time soon!"
"Build-a-burger. BYOB. Yes, Please. Let me say first it wasn't at all like I was expecting.  Place is quaint (both cute and small).  Glad I was able to grab a seat. Menu was a bit overwhelming but completely welcome. It allows you to pick your patty, your spices, your bun, your toppings, and add gourmet toppings. Salads and sides are ordered separately. They also had Beignets and Shakes which I am very upset I missed out on but the burger a piece and small fries split between two is enough to fill you up. My Grass-fed, Umami spice, LTO with mushrooms, goat cheese and black truffle mayo was cooked perfectly and absolutely delicious. That meat was pretty fantastic. All the ingredients were on point. Place is adorably decorated and enough to pull off a casual dinner date. I am sure I will be back."
"Massively overpriced.  They make an effort to give a good burger, but they charge way too much.  It's like a cafeteria, no big deal, average decor.   It's not that it's bad it's just that there is never a reason to pay top top dollar for average products."
"If you are in the mood to blow $50 for two burgers and some fires at a place that is like a cafeteria with no decor and no service -you're in luck! This place is for you. Two burgers two fries and a drink $49 No serviceNo decorThe pretzel bun is not heated or buttered - just opened from a packageThe meat I had was steak house seasoning. I rated no seasoning nothing special They don't hear or melt the cheese on it either ( ah rookie mistake , so odd) all the burgers that came out the cheese was cold I'd give it one star but it did have a roof and somewhere to sit and eat. The burger was just a grilled burger nothing memorable or good about it. The fries are fine -they're fries I have no idea how this place stays in business - you can to Chicago cut or anywhere else in the city and get a cheaper better burger with some service and nice decor.   I will never return"
Came here for lunch with my husband and young kids. Burgers were good but my turkey burger should have been well done throughout. ..was pink in some sections which is a no no. Black truffle mayo was fantastic. Beignets were too dense and we're fried for too long so I was disappointed.  I had my first taste of beignets here years back. Maybe I've had really great beignets since then and is now able to make a better comparison between all of them.
"Really wanted to like this place. Friendly service, great concept, but the food unfortunately was not memorable. Still on the lookout for a good burger!"
"This place is incredible. Small, but not too busy during the week. I love that you can customize the burger on the upfront--I typically go all out with my burgers, but when I went I was only feeling a lettuce wrap, and it was still amazing! The mixed flavor of the burger was so pungent I'm almost glad I didn't get a bun--had I, I probably wouldn't have annihilated it the way I did that night. It's a little pricey, so I won't be going every week, but it is definitely worth a trip!"
"I love checking out burger spots in the city and was excited to try Butcher and the Burger. I wanted to love it so much but unfortunately I left with the bad taste in my mouth. My medium rare grass fed burger came out well done, and my friend's burger can without the egg he asked for and also came out we'll done. We spent over $40 for two burgers a couple of sodas and fries.  We waited nearly 20 minutes for our burgers...at 3:30pm which was anything but a busy time. This will be my first and last time at Butcher and the Burger..."
"I think I drooled a little bit when my burger arrived to my table.  I saw this place on a episode of burger wars and thought I would try it out.  I'm so happy I did the burger was amazing!  I ordered the house blend with grandmas onion soup seasoning, cheddar cheese, lettuce, tomato, Dijon, mushroom, bacon, and black truffle mayo.  The burger was so juicy it was running down my arms and it was so tasty it just melted in my mouth.  I plan on coming back here so I can try all the different spice rubs."
Great burgers.  Had the venison burger special and beignets were as good as New Orleans
"Not to sound dramatic, but this was one of the best burger experiences I've ever had! I walked in and immediately felt comfortable; the restaurant, while small, had a ridiculous amount of character. From the exposed brick to the counter with pull-out stools, The Butcher and the Burger delivers a great atmosphere.However, atmosphere is nothing if the food sucks. Thankfully, Butcher lived up to the positive reviews and made my taste buds dance. I ordered the house-blend beef cooked medium and seasoned with the Chicago steakhouse seasoning. When I bit into the burger, it was obvious they use high-quality meat; it was flavorful, juicy, and seasoned perfectly. The skin-on fries were a great addition to the burger as well.My favorite part of my Butcher experience was the staff. I was greeted with a smile and didn't feel uncomfortable at all when I admitted I was a newbie. The gentleman, Mark, who helped me was funny, outgoing, and friendly...he even checked on me a couple times and refilled my water glass.Highly recommended!!"
"Had a great lunch today.  I had a burger with Chicago steakhouse seasoning, goat cheese and caramelized onions. The burger was unbelievably juicy.  The goat cheese just kept melting while I ate.  The pretzel bun just added to the experience.  The only thing that really needs work is the fries. They were hot and fresh and even had a nice crisp but something just seemed to missing.  Never the less I will be back because the burger was terrific."
"My husband and I came here after reading reviews and this place does not disappoint!  I am a vegetarian and the vegetarian patty was delicious! I got it with the ghost pepper spice rub, which definitely had a STRONG kick, but very tasty.  My husband ordered the beef burger with the ghost pepper rub, and he said it gave Kuma's plague bringer a run for the money! The burgers were delicious and the topping selections were awesomeThe small fries were huge and more than enough for 2 people. They were possibly the best fries we had ever had, if you like your fries crunchy on the outside and soft and potato-ey on the inside.Place is very small with just a few tables for seating.  Also, it's BYOB, so sweet!Definitely going back here again!"
"This place is so over-hyped. I'm generally not super critical, I leave a lot of 5 star reviews, but this place is just...ok. I've been here a few times and each time I thought, ""meh."" Average at best. AND SO OVERPRICED. $17 for a mediocre burger and fries ordered from a counter?! I'd rather just go to Edzos.  Personally, I will not be going back. Much better burgers out there for a much more reasonable price. One good thing: BYOB. Maybe that's why people think the food tastes so good."
"After going for a second time, I can honestly say that this is my favorite burger in Chicago. A plethora of options to customize your burger with (spices, toppings). It'll ring your bill up quick, but all their ingredients are fresh, and you can get the basic add-ons for free and you will still make your tummy happy. My burger the second time around was a bit over-cooked but it was still so good with the Umami spices. I just hope the next time I go back, it will be cooked to med-rare. But they had a huge catering order to finish when I came in so I understand that they were extremely busy. Wonderful and consistent place to be! The guy at the register was a bit rude though. It seemed like he didn't want to there and was pretty curt as my friend and I were browsing the options. Smile, dude. It does wonders."
"This place is good and solid, but definitely not the best burger in Chicago.I love a build-your-own-burger place--especially one with unique ingredients and seasonings. At Butcher and The Burger, you really get that wide variety of meats, seasoning, toppings, and bread. I tried the salmon burger w/ a ""creek bottom game"" rub and goat cheese. Now... I love ANYTHING with goat cheese and a strong rub. But for whatever reason, despite all the strong tastes and seasonings, the burger tasted ever-so-slightly bland. Perhaps it was the salmon base? Perhaps it was an off night? Perhaps they just didn't give me enough goat cheese. But it just wasn't my fave in the world. The meat also tasted a little dry, rather than that drippy melt in your mouth kind of satisfaction.But just for all the options and the strong effort, I still think this place is quite okay. I should probably come back at some point and give it another go with a different meat and rub. Something I did totally dig though--the pretzel bun. Definitely an excellent hearty bread option on a cold night."
"Had the Lentil Brown Rice Burger ... It immediately fell apart & was a mess to eat...good but a mess. Cute little place & interesting menu, will try again. Also Byob!"
"I really wanted to love this place...not only because of it's proximity but because of it's reckless abandon, throw it all to the wind attitude about making a burger your own.  That being said, this definitely isn't the place to get a ""normal"" burger.First of all, the staff is so sweet.  Both of the two times I've been here, they've been extremely helpful...but I've also avoided going on a Friday night when I've seen the line out the door.But the lack of a 4 or 5 star rating for me really lies in the product I was served.  While it's clear this is not a fast food joint and the food will be a step up from the norm, mine wasn't quite enough to justify the pricetag.  I should caveat that I got my food to go, jumped in my car, went straight home and went to eat my then cold fold so that didn't help much.I ordered a simple burger and fries, medium w cheddar cheese on a wheat bun and topped with the standard lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, and mayo.  The burger was quite red and coldish (like I said, I got it to go) and the toppings were just fine.  Just nothing to write home about.  The fries were...standard and not really worth what I paid for them.I want to go back and give some of their crazy concoctions a try, there has to be a reason why everyone else loves them so much!  Just not worth your dough if you are gonna go with an un-adventerous burger."
I want to like this place but it is so inconsistent.  Plus the medium well burger has twice been raw in the middle.  Their bun is also too hard and everything in the middle slides out.... Which makes for not an enjoyable eating experience
House blend beef with Chicago steakhouse seasoning is my absolute favorite. They make their own bread and butter pickles that are go die for. You can't beat an affordable delicious burger AND byob. This place is a lincoln park gem.
"Burger ParadiseShow up hungry to this joint, you won't be disappointed when leaving. There are several options for burgers, including alpaca and bison. Every burger is custom, so be ready to choose everything about your burger when ordering. The sauce and seasoning is absolutely amazing, and the burger was cooked to perfection. This burger is right now the top burger I've ever had, and I would challenge you to tell me differently. Right about now you may be thinking to yourself how much you would love to go here, but your vegetarian friend will feel left out. Not to worry, they have plenty of vegetarian options available."
Just thought it was average. The people an atmosphere are really kind. The wasabi mayo sauce was awesome but they put to much on the burger. Wish they had side/separate menus to really figure out a good match for the burger.
"A well earned 5-stars. The best part of my dining experience here besides currently sitting here enjoying a delicious food is the service. Front Cashier, Sam has delivered superior service with a warm smile, and a genuine demeanor. He was patient with me being a first time visitor in explaining the menu options and how to order (its counter ordering not waiter). Its slow due to being a lunch shifit and daytime on a Friday (DePaul campus closes by 3pm) so he even exceeded my standards/expectations by bringing my food to me, AND following up with me to see if I was enjoying my meal and if I needed anything else. Wow, I am impressed with Butcher and the Burger hiring such great staff as him.Now, onto the food! As stated earlier ordering is done at the counter, with big chalk board menus on display to explain the items. It's a build-your-own burger style that has a lot of high quality NATURAL ingredients and cooking options that make the food just taste superb. I got a turkey burger, in french onion soup seasoning, with GOAT CHEESE (yum! rare to find in a burger place in my experiences...), grilled onions, and avocado on a pretzel bun - melted in my mouth!  Also got a side of hand cut fries which were fresh and savory. YUM!So much YUM, in such a casual, cute, and unpretentious atmosphere. I love the ""neighborhood rustic diner"" feel and also the squishy bench seating if you are lucky. I suggest coming during the slow/off hours to avoid a student rush and chatter, it's quite peaceful. In my opinion, this place gives burger joints like DMK, a run for its money and reputation. Also, way less greasy and BETTER MADE INGREDIENTS! Bravo Burger and the Butcher, keep it up. PS: Also music in the restaurant was a winner, anyone who plays soul, classics, blues and some 90s wins my heart!"
"In a pinch for a quick burger?  B&B provides a variety of burgers from, turkey, salmon, shrimp, grassfed, bison, etc.  It's a build your own burger and a byob combined.  You can even pick your own spices to flavor your burger demons!  Place is clean, staff is friendly, smaller seating area but a good place to haunt for the area!  Burgers are not oversized but not to small either.  Self serve on the water down the side rail of the kitchen.  Laid back atmosphere."
"Really like this place- although rather tight location. Good burgers, nice fresh ingredient selection. Friendly staff, and cute decor.During peak business, you better hope the table next to you is wearing deodorant- because they are almost literally in your lap though."
"Ahhh..... I love this place! For the longest time this was our Sunday late-lunch spot! Where do I even start?! I love the location and the neighborhood! They have the best cajun seasoned fries! The burgers are freaking amazing!! You custom make your own burgers and get to choose the choice of meat, seasoning, sauce and bread! These guys know how to make an awesome burger! And an added advantage is that this place is a BYOB!!! Take your bottle or wine or case of beer and enjoy!!"
"This is my second time being able to try this place. I was able to take some pictures of my food which I did not get to do the first time.I arrived at 12:30 PM on the fourth of July. My friends were grilling their mass produced/transaturated fat filled burgers, so I decided before I went to go visit them at their overpriced apartment, I would have a good burger! It was not crowded but it was not empty either. I arrived with my $10 gift card that one of the owners was nice enough to offer me via Yelp. This place is so cool for multiple reasons:1. Featured in multiple publications (Men's Health Manilest Restaurant)2. Everything takes a while to cook so I had some time to talk with the staff while I waited.3. It's right next to DePaul! Onto the food! I ordered the House Blend Beef with the salad of teh day. Thank goodness I had my gift card from the owner. My total ended up being 8.23! The medium rare burger was cooked to perfection! I had the salt and pepper blend which was the right choiceMy only gripe is that my salad came with the dressing on the salad rather than on the side. The cranberry salad was made with onion, feta, mixed greens, and even oranges.This is by far the BEST burger I've ever had. Based on taste and context, I love this place! Prices are a bit high, but that's what you get when burgers and sides are made from scratch and are ""local. I highly recommend this place in you're on the north side."
"It may be too early to write this since I'm new to the gourmet burger game, but yesterday I experienced the best burger of my life at Butcher and the Burger. I did my research before going, so knew exactly what I wanted once I made it in. I love the fact that everything is so customizable and it's really a build-your-own burger menu. Sometimes you get nervous of spit in your food after a long laundry list of leaving off and adding ingredients. Not here, though. I went with the grass-fed burger (only $0.75 more than the regular meat) with Grandma's Onion Soup as my seasoning, a lettuce wrap (for low carbs sake) and my ingredients: mushrooms, swiss cheese, onions, pickles, and mayo. I'm pretty sure the pickles were homemade because they were 100% delicious and I devoured them before I could even snap a picture of them. The best part of the burger is that it's extra thick, so even if you choose to go bun-less, you won't even notice the difference. Since mine was done in the soup it was extra drippy and juicy. Had we been at home, I would have had no choice but to lick up the entire plate, but I try to act classy in public so I had to resist the urge. It WAS that good. I can't even describe how perfect my burger was. Everything about it was spot on. My husband went with a similar one, but went with the steakhouse seasoning, blue cheese and tomatoes. He loved his equally as much, but since I was wrapped up in my own burger obsession, I didn't get to steal a bite. We didn't try the fries, but I did like that there was a sign warning vegetarians that the fries are made with lard. If you wanted lard-free fries, all you had to do was ask and they'd make up a special basket for you.I'm still planning to try all of the great burger joints that Chicago has to offer, but Butcher and the Burger has set the bar pretty damn high."
"I normally don't write reviews but my all friends have been telling me to post my experience at Butcher and the Burger up. I HIGHLY DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS PLACE.I'm a huge fan of food and I love anything and everything. To be honest, my pallet isn't really ""refined"" because literally I love all kinds of food. BUT, I came here with my boyfriend a couple months back. My boyfriend order a burger and I ordered some croissant avocado sandwich. We waited about 30 minutes for our food and realized people after us were getting served before us. So I went up and asked where our burgers were at and it seemed they forgot to put in our order?!!?... okay, it happens all the time.. right? So we waited another 15 minutes only to realize that they didn't even get the right order :/  I went up a second time.. trying to be polite because I understand it can get busy and I kind of felt bad for coming up again. And the owner literally rolled his eyes at me, like it was my fault. But whatever, i was starving!Now, this was the WORST part of my experience. When my correct order finally arrived at my table, the owner THREW the plate on the table!!! RUDE! I mean, I've never been mistreated at a restaurant this bad before.THEN something even WORST happen.. in my croissant burger.. there was a short black hair inside. I seriously was disgusted and really upset. My boyfriend was literally about to make a scene but I honestly just wanted to leave. I calmed him down and we left the restaurant very unhappy and put us in a really bad mood for the rest of the night. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF TIME and enjoy a nice burger joint where they actually care about their customers. It's SERIOUSLY not even worth the food. I don't even care if the food was good, if your going to treat someone with this much disrespect then you might as well not even open at all."
An extremely good burger.  I opted for the Chicago seasoning.  The fries were outstanding.  The service was great as the cashier was extremely nice (and patient) with a couple of tourists asking numerous questions.  Her recommendations were spot-on.  the beignets were amazing (used cafe du monde mix).
"You know how sometimes you practice your coffee order repeatedly in your head before you order at Starbucks so you won't mess it all up and confuse the barista and piss off the people behind you in line? No? Just me? Okay, moving along. My point is...Butcher & The Burger is also I place where I may or may not have had to practice before I gave my order ::cough cough:::You can make your burger so damned customized there are approximately thirty thousand variations of things you must tell the cashier so you can get a burger you like. Mine Had: -grass-fed beef (for only a dollar more, don't miss this by being cheap)-house-blend spices-American cheese (don't hate, it was my birthday)-split top egg bun-lettuce-tomatocarmelized onions-ketchup-pickles-something else I'm forgettingThings Available I Did Not Partake in: -seared foie gras-seafood patty-avocado-raw onions-grilled mushrooms-umami seasoning-more exotic things I can't remember but still impressed me at the timeDespite the anxiety of reciting a grocery list to a cashier on a whim, the burger was certainly worth it. I cannot compare it to DMK burger, but it was up in the top 5 best burgers I've ever had. DMKs burger was fancy, patty thinner, bread softer, but stil, couldn't pick a clear winner over this one. This is generally where I end rave reviews, but I would like to also mention here is where I tried my first frozen custard, mango pineapple flavor. It was AMAZING. Cannot wait to return to B&TB for more fabulous BYOB, burgers and custard!!"
"I enjoyed my burger, but it wasn't anything out of the usual for me. If I lived in the neighborhood I'd visit again. It's a bit tight and awkward if you eat there. Try the jalapeño relish, it was a spicy good time."
"House mix, backwood rub, egg, truffle mayo, l, t, onion & pickle on pretzel bun=awesomeness"
"Life is good when food is this good. Lots of choices,  friendly staff, right off the brown line and did I mention so good?The place is small so it's tight. Wishing them lots of business so they can expand."
"I went here Saturday night with a friend and it was incredibly busy...after I ate my burger, I knew why. You order at the counter and find your own seat. I ordered the beef patty (no bun, of course) with the Chicago steakhouse spice blend. They offer a lettuce wrap bun for those who eat gluten free. The burger was a bit undercooked from medium (what I ordered), but it was very well flavored. We also split french fries which were delicious. They were a bit thicker but perfectly crisp on the outside...my kind of fry!This place is perfect for a casual meal when you are in the mood to be a bit gluttonous."
"Looking for a simple, quality burger? You've come to the right place! As I've said before in other reviews, I'm a traditionalist when it comes to hamburgers. I hate all of that ""fancy"" stuff (extra toppings besides the usual lettuce, tomato, and onion). That may impress other people but I prefer to taste a quality burger patty and bun. Butcher & the Burger didn't let me down. The angus beef patty was perfectly cooked and seasoned with salt and pepper. The cheese was melted and the split top bun was toasted perfectly. Great burger!I should also mention that each burger is fully customizable. You select the type of meat: angus beef, grass fed beef, bison, salmon, veggie..the list goes on and on! You can even select what seasonings you like on your beef patty. They also have a large list of toppings and sauces to choose from. As if that weren't enough, there are several bun options as well. No matter how you prefer your burger, Butcher's got you covered."
"I've lived in Chicago for two years now, sampled dozens of burger joints, and Butcher & The Burger is as good as it gets here or elsewhere.  As others have noted, B&TB has always been BYOB and the neighborhood wine shop, The Poison Cup, is located across the street and to the left if your back is to the restaurant's front door, less than a quarter mile away (The Poison Cup is closed on Monday's, so plan accordingly).  We first started going to B&TB when they first opened and had a slow and steady traffic, but these days, it can be difficult to find a seat and there is no reservation system.  I recommend trying it at an in-between time as Lincoln Parkers flock to Butcher for any and all meals, it seems. I'd suggest not going with a group, and keeping your party to three or less, simply because most of the tables are for two, its too loud to enjoy it communally, and having a big group means your orders will never arrive at the same time at this place.Diners can choose from a small set suggestion box for burger building located on the left side of the ordering station; otherwise, they're up to their own wits to navigate the choices of meat, seasonings, bun, toppings, condiments, and eventually extras, like their homemade custard, decadent french fries, and impossible-to-live-without truffle mayo. The burgers are large and hardy and their fry basket is even roomier, so be prepared to split the fries two ways and tell your partner they better snag their own cup of truffle mayo, because noone, no matter how much they love you, is going to want to share that.  [My two cents: the best burger is their house prime, umami seasoning on a split top bun with pepperjack cheese (if available, otherwise mozzarella), lettuce, pickle, mustard, and tomato with fries to share and truffle mayo to not.Try a shiraz for the wine, and the chocolate custard is what you want, for sure.]"
You have to try their burgers!Eating one right now- soo f#*% good!Great locationGreat staffGreat foodGood prices
"Best burger I've had so far in Chicago (not done searching yet though!).  So big and juicy, the meat is unbelievably tasty.  The meat is the star here, unlike some other burger places where toppings overpower the beef.I had the beef burger with the steakhouse spices blue cheese.  It was perfect.  So good I got it again the next time I came.I think the fries are awesome but I love thick cut fries.BYOB is a big plus.  Haven't tried it but my friend thought the custard was awesome.  Also has nice outdoor seating.  Only cons:1) wish they had more pre-set options, too many choices.  I like having a chef select my flavor combinations.2) don't like the order at the counter and then sit down model, is kind of stressful (I get worried there won't be a seat!)3)the ordering process is super slow, mostly because there are too many options (another point for having pre-set options)."
"The house burger is great! Juicy and well seasoned. Try the ghost pepper spice blend if you want a little kick, or mix it with another spice blend. The fries were thick cut and very crispy, right out of the fryer! I had to season them with salt n pepper but not necessary - they had some seasoning. Great customer service."
"Delicious all around. Plus, the Cafe du Monde beignets were such a comfort as a Louisiana native. Would definitely return!"
"After all the raves I heard about the Butcher and The Burger, I knew I had to give this place a try.  You build your own specialty burger at the counter, then have a seat and wait for them to bring out your unique creation on a cutting board.  Don't feel intimidated if you do not know what you want, the staff is really helpful and will offer suggestions.  Also for you vegetarians, they offer a veggie burger.Every single time I make a new creation, the burger comes out exactly how I requested it.  This is one of the only burger joints who don't overcook my meat.  The burger patty is always juicy and tender.  I even tried their turkey burger thinking it would be slightly dry, but to my surprise it was full of flavor and not the slightest bit dry.  I do agree with the other Yelpers that this place is a little pricey.  Its almost $10 for a burger and you have to pay extra for fries and a drink.  But you pay for what you get.  If you want to have excellent service and good quality burgers, then swing on by to this Lincoln Park exclusive burger joint.  You definitely won't be disappointed."
"It's hard for me to get super excited about 'haute' burgers.  Food was good, nothing was amazing, place was a little cramped and uncomfortable.  I actually sort of hated the bacon which is something that is really hard for me to wrap my mind around."
"Mmmmm Burger.This was the first thing that I thought of when I found myself at the front door to Butcher & The Burger.  Honest!My first impressions of the Lincoln Park neighborhood were really good- so I had very high hopes for this spot... and the Butcher didn't disappoint. I was immediately greeted by a super nice & very chill guy behind the counter taking orders.  After a couple recommendations by said chill dude I handed over the cash for what was expected to be a delicious burger.What did I order?*  Well I started with a patty of naturally raised turkey ($8.50), tossed it in some Chicago Steakhouse spices and topped with bacon ($2), some goat cheese, lettuce, pickles & some bbq sauce all on a pretzel bun (extra 50cents).  Grand total: $11.  and my burger was flippin' awesome.  Sooo juicy, so flavorful (loved the steakhouse seasoning) and piled high.  There was nothing about this burger that wrong.Along with my burger I asked for a small order of their fries.  What I got on my platter was a really generous helping of crisp-on-the-outside golden fries.  Yum yum yum.While the food was definitely the star of this show the restaurant itself is pretty cool.  It has a great mixture clean lines & rustic finishes.  White tiles + high ceilings.  Wood tables + metal chairs.  Old school accessories + open kitchen.  The staffers were dancing and singing along to the background music and seemed to be having a good time, but were quick to deliver the food when the 'order up' bell rang. Don't feel like ordering a soda?  No problemo- they've got iced tea, freshly squeezed lemonade and free water cups. Is it a nice day outside?  Then you should totally grab a seat at one of the sidewalk tables. Have a craving for a burger- get on over and place your order at Butcher & The Burger.  Best burger & combo I've had in Chicago to date. ------------------------------------------*On any given day these guys have 8 meats, 9 spice blends, 5 buns, 6 cheeses & 14+ sauces/toppings to choose from.  So many possibilities!"
"Solid place for both classic burgers and ethnic-inspired burgers. There are tons of options for the type of meat (beef, turkey, bison, shrimp, salmon), toppings, and marinades/seasonings. The guy behind the counter was extremely helpful in describing the menu and recommending flavor pairings for meats. I got the shrimp burger with wasabi mayo (and umami seasoning, I think it was called) and my friend got a coconut curry beef burger (with duck egg and sriracha mayo). The shrimp burger is surprisingly hearty, they make a large patty that's crispy on the outside. The marinade stayed true to good asian flavors, with soy sauce, ginger, etc. My friend really enjoyed his burger as well. The fries here are pretty solid too. A different experience from umami burger, if you've been there, so this is worth a try as well."
"The Butcher and the Burger might be my new favorite burger joint in Chicago.  You might not get same size burger from other big name burger joints in the city but the taste was amazing. I was very lucky to come on day when they had a guest chef there, chef Tom Ramesy from Jackson, Mississippi and his Mississippi Burger was out of this word! The southern style ingredients like bacon jam, seasoned cooked greens and mustered put this burger over the edge. By the way I highly recommend getting a side of BBQ pork belly. FYI: I will be taking the butcher class they offer, and I can't wait! On 11/14/2014"
"I'll start by saying the one star off is for the price. For what the burger is, I think the place is pricey. That said, great burger. It's fun to go in there and process the menu, with all the customizable options. I got the regular beef burger with desert chili spice. Get the pretzel bun, duh. Also got sriracha mayo - anything with sriracha and I'm sold. The fries are diner style, I think that's the best way to explain them. Very good. I like how the burgers come out on the cutting board, great presentation. I want to try the lentil rice burger next time. This place is on my commute to work now so I'm sure I'll be going here more often."
"Expensive, yes, but in my mind totally worth it!Finally made my way over to Butcher & The Burger to see if all the hype was true and discovered that it was. It's a bit intimidating at first because you basically create your own burger from top to bottom-meat to spices to toppings to bun. My advice, keep it simple and let their quality meat and seasoning shine through. Stick with a couple great toppings and you can't go wrong. Also make sure to get an order of their fries because they're AMAZING...order the truffle aioli on the side and then you can spread a little on your burger and dip your fries in the rest...win, win. Loved B&TB and can't wait to return!"
"After receiving a nice note from the owner, I decided to try B&B again.  My burger was delicious.  I ordered nearly the exact same thing I did the first time and was not disappointed.  The burgers are pricey, but they are good.  I will be back."
"So happy that we finally made it here!  I found myself with a Monday off of work, so what to do....  Drag my husband out of work for lunch!  We arrived right at 11 am, when they were opening.  Ordering went smoothly after we made our decisions (and there are LOTS of options).  I had a duck egg, caramelized onions, bleu cheese, and mayo  burger with Chicago Steakhouse seasoning.  This was indeed a fork and knife meal...but worth every messy, dripping bite!  I will say, that the only down side (kind of a big downer, actually) was that my burger was not medium as ordered.  If it had been cooked properly, I would have been in burger euphoria.  I do think a burger joint should be able to cook the meat as ordered, especially since we were there at an off time.The fries were very, very tasty, and the small size was more than big enough for two.  Almost wish they had a smaller version for a single diner...The staff was very, very friendly and helpful.  The little diner was adorable and very comfortable.Will be back and crossing my fingers (and toes) for a burger that is cooked to medium...."
Visit this restaurant often. Place in Chicago for homemade fresh burger. It is worth the drive and back. Saw this place on diners drive-ins and dives hooked every since.
"This place has been sitting patiently in my bookmarks waiting to be visited, and I finally was able to fulfill its call.  I went with a friend and I was obviously more excited having been waiting months to try this place our after heading that their goats ""cut grass"" at O'Hare.  The day had finally come and I felt like I was reaching some sort of milestone with being able to cross this of my ""to go to"" list.The delicious smells of multiple different kinds of meat were very enticing upon entering.  The interior is neatly decorated with a retro farmhouse type vibe. We were greeted with a smile and a friendly server when we entered.  She asked us if we had been there before, we said no, and she asked if she could explain how the menu works.  She was very helpful in explaining it is a build your own burger place with many different options to choose from.  They do have a ""premade"" menu if you don't feel like going through and customizing your burger to make your friends jealous but that takes the fun out of it, unless you're having a lazy day which would be about the one exception.They also had a special for the day of a duck burger.  Now don't get me wrong, I enjoy duck, but I've never had it in burger form.  My friend was sold on the duck burger so I went ahead and blazed my customization trail of creating the ultimate burger.  I ordered the grass-fed beef on a pretzel bun, with their traditional rub, medium rare, with tomato, onion, lettuce, and BBQ sauce.  I realized after we left I made one fatal error:  I did not add bacon to this burger...next time.   I ordered some fries for the both of us and we took our seats.  The burgers and fries came out quick and were asking to be devoured.My burger was delicious and a definite front runner for man's never ending quest to make the ultimate burger.  The fries were super addicting and as we neared the end the inevitable ""just one more"" event took place.  My friend and I cut off samples of each other's burgers to try and I was pleasantly surprised at how the duck burger tasted.  After eating through almost all of the fries after we both claimed we were full, it was time for a shake.  They had vanilla, chocolate, and seemed like they run a special flavor as well.  I went with good old reliable vanilla and my friend got the pistachio shake.  They were a little on the pricey side but they tasted heavenly.I am glad to have made to to this awesome restaurant.  I will definitely be back and actually am getting hungrier by the minute as I write this review.  Go forth and eat meat!"
"Really delicious burger - very flavorful, cooked perfectly, and endless topping possibilities.  Fries were also good - the small was plenty big for my fiance and I to split. We went on a weekday so it wasn't too busy and we were able to get a seat easily."
"This is one of my favorite lunch spots during the summer.  We went on my birthday and sat outside on the cute patio to enjoy a relaxing lunch.  I've been here a few times and haven't been disappointed.  It's an ""order at the counter"" joint, where they will bring your food to you.  You build your own burger with almost too many selections for your own good.  I love the spices they offer; my favorite being the Burger Meets Sun, with ghost pepper.  It has such a kick to it!  Throw on all your fixins (don't forget the fried egg!), order ONE side of fries for the entire table, and a mexican coke to complete your meal.  If you have any room for dessert, try the beignets!  They taste like they're straight from Cafe du Monde.  A positive experience for all!"
"An incredible burger.  I visited this place very close to it's closing time and was treated with the utmost respect and kindness by the staff there.  I had a burger with cheddar, steakhouse seasoning, and bacon, cooked to a perfect medium.  The flavor of the burger was outstanding, and every bite was juicy and delicious.  I had the fries as which were great and fresh.  The food was great and the service was outstanding as well. If you're looking for a great burger in Chicago you should put this on your list and try it out.  It's BYOB which is a nice touch as well.  I'll be back when I'm in town next time"
"All the clever concepting, unique condiments, and cute decorations makes no difference if the beef burger is overcooked and disappointing. Which it was.  Medium rare came out medium well.  Culprit was a grillman who was obsessed with burning meat on flames that extended eight inches above the grill surface.  Not a healthy or pleasant way to cook, and the beef burger was not only overcooked but breaking into numerous pieces.  The shrimp burger was far better."
"We came on a Saturday (around 11:30) before it got really busy.  My husband ordered a bison burger with truffle mayo and bacon. I had a salmon burger with wasabi mayo and added avocado. We also got an order of fries to share. The fries were REALLY good, perfectly crispy and delecatable. The burgers were very good but not amazing. They also forgot my husband's truffle mayo and a few of the other items he ordered on his burger, but they were quick to fix the issue so it was appreciated. For the price, I'd rather have a burger at Au Cheval or Shake Shack. The fries are noteworthy though. We did not have a chance to try the beignets, sadly."
"Unbeatable. High-quality ingredients and the freedom to leave having eaten what you want. What could be better?Thought it's a bit more expensive, I went with the bison burger. Cooked to perfection with blue cheese, dijon mustard, mushrooms and tomato. The wood plank they serve their burgers on lends a rustic, down-home touch.My husband hit it hard with the grass-fed beef, fried egg, cheddar cheese and bacon. We will definitely go back; food is just as good as Kuma's and the atmosphere is 100 times nicer and more relaxed."
"I have NEVER had a better burger. Grass fed on split top, Chicago steak seasoning, goat cheese, siracha mayo, cooked medium. Great crunchy char, flame-kist flavor. Regardless of whether you live in Chicago or just visit, make the effort to hit Butcher & the Burger... just a little more than a block off the Brown and Purple lines. Friendly, helpful staff makes it a great place for a newbie."
"This place has one of the best burgers I've ever tasted! The menu is so interesting. You choose the type of bread, meat, cheese, and toppings. It was a pretty quick service. We split delicious fries it would have been too big of a serving for one person. But the burgers were so moist and flavorful. I can't wait to go back and get another one. If driving there is street parking which can get busy on weekends."
"This place is pretty awesome! There's not a lot of seating inside, but I was alone, so I made it work. They also have a small outdoor seating area. I had a beef burger (they have a few more meat options) and fries and they were both very very good! My burger was juicy and seasoned perfectly. The fries are some of the best fresh cut fries around. I have to say this is one of the best burger and fries meals I've had I a long, long time. Service was fast and efficient. They also serve homemade custard and milkshakes! I didn't try either, but I definitely will in the future. I will definitely revisit Butcher & The Burger and I highly recommend it if you're looking for a solid burger and fries."
I have not but great things to say about this place. Chicago isn't only the home of the pizza but they are also home of some of the best burgers as well. Butcher & the Burger is on my list for one of the best burgers in chicago. The ability to customize your burger is a huge selling point. I always have grass fed beef with some fresh vegetables on top. Besides their burgers their french fries are equally as amazing. Unlike other great burger places who skimp on the fries they put in just as much effort in every aspect. You will not leave this place with an empty stomach.
"The burgers here are solid.  I like that you have the option for a lettuce bun if you're not starving (because sometimes all that bread is too much!)  The fries here are SO good -- different.  They are thick, rectangular cut and double fried (I think).  I would seriously come here just for the fries... with a side of truffle mayo.  I love coming here in the summer time.  It's small and sorta tough to get a seat sometimes, but definitely worth the wait."
"Burgers are amazing! Medium rare actually means medium rare. They have a wide selection of meats, cheeses, add-ons and even buns. They also have a decent selection of sides.Downsides are, the burgers are slightly small but this can be fixed by ordering a basket of their tasty fries or one of their thick milkshakes. Make sure you read the chalkboard menu thoroughly, it is slightly disorganized and certain items are easy to miss. Seating is tight but they do have an outdoor section. It's a great place to eat quickly and continue shopping or hit a bar up in the area. It's also BYOB, so take advantage! Burger on, fellow food enthusiasts!"
"We enjoyed eating here before. Good burgers, that's what matters... Except when you don't get good burgers. We were placing our delivery order today, from GrubHub, at 11:30 with an expected delivery time of 1:00 (1.5 hours). We figured it was worth the wait, so we pulled the trigger. 10 minutes before the food is due to arrive I receive a very apologetic voicemail explaining their delivery service is not able to make deliveries today. I later find a $10 GrubHub credit in an attempt to placate me. Obviously, the main problem here is relying on an unreliable delivery service. Remember, it doesn't matter how good your product is if you don't DELIVER on your promises."
"The burgers and fries were delicious!  I had the grass fed burger on pretzel bread.  Also had a beignet for dessert.  Very good!  It's an interesting vibe with friendly service. The seating area is pretty small, but there is also outdoor seating in the summer.  It's a little more than the average burger place, but the quality of the beef choices were also better.  I wouldn't make a special trip, but if in the area, it would be my first choice."
"I had my first shrimp burger and it was amazing! I'm a pescatarian  and honestly I hate going to burger joints. When my fiancé mentions a burger place, I often give him a look like ""you must be kidding me"". Though this place is awesome!! Great patio it's a little sideways ( the sidewalk is tilted) and it reminded me of a southern BBQ. Perfect shrimp burger ""surf special"" this includes tomato, avocado, wasabi mayo, umami spice sub for a pretzel bun add caramelized onions! Delish! FYI: their fries are cooked in vegetable oil with a bit of animal lard. A lot of restaurants do this, though they have a sign to let you know they do! I also just found out that they have a fryer without this. So if your a vegan or veggie you can still get fries! Amazing! It looks like a lot of people enjoyed the fries. My fiancé sure did. Love that we can walk here! Will for sure be back soon!"
The food was excellent!I ordered the Vegetarian Burger and it had to be hands down the best l've ever tasted!I had mine with the ghost pepper rub and it was bursting with so much flavor!  I topped the burger off with a fried egg which only added to it's deliciousness.The fries came out seasoned just right.They can make the fries without lard as well.Service was prompt and quick.  They have a knowledgable staff.Go check this place out!
Buffalo burger with BBQ sauce/bacon/cheddar. My god...just fantastic. The fries were immaculate as well!Girlfriend's burger was really really salty though...maybe just a bad batch of the beef.
"I decided to order from Butcher & The Burger when I was in Lincoln Park and wanted to take advantage of my DoorDash (doordash.com) credits. I do not eat read meat and was extremely pleased to see how many options they had for their burgers! After much deliberation, I settled on the Salmon Burger, and ordered on a Split Top Butter Egg Bun with the following seasonings and toppings: Cameron Parish Cajun Blend, Cheddar Cheese, Mayo, Tomato, Yellow Mustard, Avocado, and Caramelized Onions. The avocado and caramelized onions were a few dollars extra. I ordered a Small  Hand-Cut Kennebec Fries along with a Fresh-Squeezed Lemonade and two beignets. I went to undergrad in New Orleans, so I was so excited to see a Cajun blend seasoning as well as beignets being an option for a side item! My order came within the estimated time and was warm upon arrival. Everything was delicious -- no exaggeration. The toppings and seasonings were perfect for my salmon burger along with the type of bread. The burger got a little sloppy trying to eat it but I didn't mind. The small fries was more than enough! The lemonade was excellent and the beignets were amazing! Definitely ordering from here again and looking forward to trying the other types of burgers, seasoning and topping combinations!"
"When I crave a burger, it's 'watch out, get out of the way, Ebs is on a mission' type action.  I will get a burger no matter what.  On this day, I decided to try a new burger place, and why not try one with such good reviews... Oh, what a let down.  First, the ordering is screwed up.  I had to wait behind a family for 15 minutes because the menu is so sporadic (and not much description) that it's hard for people to choose.  Next, the burger wasn't anything spectacular by any means.  There was no juiciness that dribbled onto my plate when I squeezed it.  There was no melt in your mouth beef that would make me tremble in anticipation.  All it was a piece of bland meat with a lot of ingredients on top, which proved extremely messy and inefficient.  Even the fries were nothing to write home about (or write to Yelp about).  Granted, maybe I ordered the wrong combination of things.  But, come on, I've never had a problem before messing up a burger's ingredients, hmpf."
"Nothing beats a good burger.  Ever.  These guys...do good burgers! I don't think there's such a thing as a bad combination.  You choose your meat, what spices it's grilled with, cheese, sauces, toppings both cold and hot, and bread- or lack thereof.  When I'm really hungry I get anxious because I can't make up my mind...but there's a ""specials board"" that'll help you out listing a few of the days combinations.  Somehow my friends and I beat the crowd in- but by the time we left there wasn't a whole lot of seating left.  It's that popular...it's that good...because the choice is yours."
"I am in this part of town often, so I've had the pleasure of dining here a few times. It's a good location, but seating is limited. The staff there is always nice and ready to help with any questions. The menu is broken down to all the parts of a burger, so you can customize everything down to your preferred seasonings. After choosing the type of meat, seasoning, bun, temperature, and all toppings, I can only expect to get the burger of my dreams. I usually do. Pricing does reflect this customized menu though. I've tried most of the sides too and they're pretty good, but I'd rather save the space in my stomach for another burger."
"Like butter.My husband, our six-year-old son and I ate lunch here on a Saturday afternoon and were pleasantly surprised. We've lived nearby and have been meaning to stop in. It was very good.I'll start by saying the meat is A+ quality. Our friends own a farm and we always split a cow between families and cook burgers all summer. You can definitely recognize quality beef vs. a ""backyard burger,"" as some referenced. This stuff is like butter.I ordered the grass-fed burger cooked medium with caramelized onions, wasabi mayo, and swiss cheese. My husband had the All American burger cooked medium with caramelized onions and our son had the kid's grass-fed burger. We also ordered a large side of hand cut fries. I read several Yelp reviews regarding the prices, but rest assured, you get a good portion of meat. I really don't feel their prices are unreasonable. Since it was really busy when we stopped in, I didn't get a chance to study the menu. There are so many great toppings like foie gras, duck egg, smoked bacon, etc. We will definitely be back with a bottle of wine. Got to love the no cork fee (the way it should be by law)!"
"You can find a burger anywhere - lots of places - fast food joints, bars, gastropubs, chain restaurants, fine dining establishments, and at indie establishments like the Butcher and the Burger.  The variety at where you can get a burger makes it difficult to put them against each other, but despite where you get it from, there's a few common qualities to a great burger.The first and the most important is the quality of the beef, and that's where the Butcher and the Burger shines.  Al Sternweiler's house blend of angus beef has an awesome earthy flavor that doesn't need much else.  As far as spices go, you have a variety of choices - from a simple salt and pepper blend, to more flavorful blends like curry-coconut honey, to the extreme ghost-pepper blend.   I went with the Cajun blend that added perfect amounts of cayenne to the very flavorful beef.  The second factor in a good burger is the roll, and there's no better roll that adds to a burger than a pretzel roll (a brioche may come close, but pretzel still wins out IMO).   The pretzel roll here is of perfect thickness with hints of butter.   The third component of a good burger is the supporting cast - the cheese, veggie toppings, and sauce.  Some places (Longman & Eagle comes to mind) keep it bare bones and simple, others (Kuma's the obvious one) stack on as the ingredients as high as possible.  Many places let you choose your own. I chose here to keep it moderate, adding lettuce, tomato (fairly average), a slice of Swiss (smooth, not too sharp), and Benton's bacon (thick cut, nice and meaty, you can see sneaking in at the bottom).  And lastly, how all of that comes together can be a bit of an art.  Here, the stack was quite high, which made it tough to take the first bite or two, but the roll squashed down a bit, so it became fairly manageable.  The combo of the swiss and the thick-cut bacon was the perfect complement to the patty.  The fries here aren't quite up my alley.  Hand cut, skin on, in the same vain as Five Guys, and cooked in lard, so there's a decent amount of oil, but it definitely adds a pretty strong flavor.  The issue was they're a bit thick and in the end somewhat undercooked.  The truffle in the mayo wasn't overpowering and worked well.  We ended the meal with beignets and some of their house made frozen custard.  The beignets were good, but not on the level of Cafe DuMonde in NOLA which they model them after.  The custard - raspberry swirl, had more of an ice cream consistency and not overly impressive.  As the name might suggest, the burgers are the highlights here.   I recommend keeping it simple - the quality of the patties and the buns shine, and some of the add-ons can cause the price to sneak up if you're not careful.  Definitely interested in trying the grass-fed patty next time, and some of the other patties I'm sure are solid too - the turkey, salmon, and bison burgers all sound interesting.   Pics and more details up on my blog: eatinginchicago2014.word…"
"I am trying very hard to check off things on my bookmark list.  I finally got an opportunity to stop by here since I was going to be going to a concert somewhere around the area.This is one of those places where you look at the menu and get overly excited because of all the possibilities of choices you could make.  You look and feel the need to order this, that and some more of something else...then all of the sudden you somehow ordered $30 meal.  When you get the total, you sheepishly pay because you have to own up to your inability to have self control.  The options really are endless and it's so easy to get carried away, but why wouldn't you want to? Why have a simple burger when you can have the ULTIMATE burger that you've always dreamed of.I was a fan of my humongous burger...anything with an egg on it makes this girl happy! Fries were delicious. Everything was cooked the way I liked it. Ingredients were fresh. Pretty satisfied.They do boast about their beignets and I was so excited to see it on the menu.  I ordered 6 for $5 or whatever was the option.  I was however very disappointed with it.  I'm used to beignets being really light and airy, but these were very heavy/tough...doughy. Not at all what I anticipated.  Since this was such a big part of what they offer and how good it was not....I had to knock off a star."
"For some reason I was expecting a larger location. We literally drove right by it. I haven't been in the area in ages, and it has changed over quite a bit. I should have spent more time looking into the place so that I would have been more prepared like doing a BYOB, and that I could have considered doing carry-out. I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't a waiter service type of restaurant, and was happy to approach the counter to place our order. I was slightly overwhelmed by the choices, and missed the specials on the placard to the left. I was happy with my medium cooked grass-fed burger that had everything on it, but didn't really taste the spicyness of the ghost pepper seasoning that it was supposed to have. Maybe the girl didn't understand that I was confirming that I wanted it even though she said it was spicy, but yes I wanted spicy - otherwise I would have loaded it with jalapeno and pepperjack cheese. In any case, I did try my boyfriend's Chicago Steakhouse style rub burger and that was really tasty. The fries are delicious and addictive. The coleslaw is pretty good, too. I think the prices are getting comparable to all the other burger spots, and it can certainly add up with the toppings. The spot is small so it's going to be a bit crowded or you will have to wait for seating. We must have come at the right time to get seats up against the window where no one else was yet sitting. The staff was pretty attentive, getting us ice and bringing up our orders and taking away empty baskets and trash. I'm totally game for coming back and doing pick-up orders if we are in the area again."
"Not the best, or even a 10 top burger spot, in Chicago.I ordered the grass fed burger, medium, with steakhouse seasoning. The whole burger had a burnt taste. My dad makes better burgers on his grill.I did enjoy the pickles on the burger, the soft and eggy bun, potato salad, and fries. All of which helped to clear the burnt taste."
"When I ordered a $14 turkey burger off the 'specials' menu, I assumed I was getting a meal, like a really big burger that came with fries and stuff. I wasn't. My girlfriend, who is clearly smarter than me, ordered a $5 'kids size' hamburger. OUR BURGERS WERE THE SAME SIZE. Also, it took FOREVER to get our food. Yes the place was busy, but that's definitely the longest I've ever waited for a burger. The burger was good, but not $14 good. Crazy over-priced and crazy slow service."
"In my opinion, the burger and fries were just okay; I've had better. My burger wasn't cooked the way I had asked, so I sent it back and when it came out again, the burger was in two pieces in the bun so part of it fell out after the first bite. They also forgot to bring out my fries, which I had to ask for."
"After seeing the menu and all of the choices, I was so overwhelmed. I opted out and got a burger with all the traditional fixes and I chose to get the Chicago steakhouse blend. It was probably one of the best burger I have ever had. It was so tasty. The beignet are delicious too. The service was great and the staff was super friendly."
"Service and food were great. Wait was pretty long, and people could argue that the food prices get steep if you add a bunch to your burger.Overall-good experience and I'd recommend it to burger lovers. PS-dip your fries in custard"
"Great burger and fries, gets a bit busy, but definitely going back."
"The menu was a little intimidating at first, but in a good way. Basically the menu was setup so that you pick what kind of meat, spice rub, toppings, bun, sides, and drinks you wanted on your burger/with your meal. I picked the House blend of beef with the creek bottom game mix as my spice rub, on a split top bun, with onions, lettuce, pickles, and ketchup, a side of fries and a diet coke as my drink. The burger was ahhhhmmmmazzzinnng! It seriously was so delicious and the fries OMG!! They were cut big and seasoned with sea salt that made them so mouthwatering good. After finishing our meals, my sister and myself were fully satisfied with the meal and will definitely be returning to Butcher & the Burger soon! So if you are ever in Lincoln Park craving a burger check Butcher & the Burger out, you will not regret it!!"
"Since my first experience I've been back and it was delicious. No smoke, great atmosphere, and all around good time."
"Since the owner took the time to write me about my review, I went back. This time, I got the bison burger with the game spice. I really enjoyed the flavor of the bison and how juicy it was. The spice blend was just ok, kind of hard to describe the taste though. It almost looked like a Mediterranean blend actually. I'd opt for the steakhouse seasoning next time. Also, I got two beignets with cinnamon sugar. They're hot, soft, and fluffy...just a total indulgence. Even without getting that great pickle, it was still a better experience than last time."
First time from out of town. This is a cozy corner burger joint. You basically build your own burger by choosing from a variety of different meat and what makes this place special is the seasoning that the meat is marinated in. I ordered the grass fed beef with the Chicago signature sauce and topped it off with a fried egg with a side of large fries. My friend also ordered the grass fed beef with umami sauce (which had an asian kick to it) and with grilled mushrooms.Nothing special about the fries however the burgers were very unique and the one my friend ordered had a lot more flavors then mine but it was still good. Oh and the chocolate shake was quite creamy due to the fact that it was made from custard. Lastly the decor matched the name. Butcher and the burger.
"I know this place doesn't need another great review, but i'm giving it anyway. I got a takeout, so I know that diminishes the presentation, but the taste was absolutely exactly what I'd been hoping for. I like my burgers rare and not every restaurant can handle that for some reason. This burger was absolutely perfectly cooked and the taste caused me to make a little noise that I usually reserve for my bedroom. The fries were perfectly crispy and didn't need any extra salt, which doesn't always happen. The biggest surprise for me here was the cookie. Chocolate chip walnut maybe? But the walnut was ground up maybe? I have no idea but I should have bought like eight of them and just eaten them till I passed out. They're amazing and if you don't eat one you will regret it for the rest of your life. Or you should. You should be ashamed of yourself. Anyway, that's all. I'll be back guys!"
The fries were over cooked but they had the potential to be great!My burger was cooked on a grill that left black stuff with a smokey-ish taste that I cant stand. The space is small. It felt too stuffy and it wasn't exactly the cleanest. It was also terribly over priced. I would not return.
"We came here on Sunday for lunch and it was pretty crowded. But I didn't expect it to take 15-20 minutes just to order. I felt there was some inefficiency or they do it that way on purpose so that the kitchen can catch up. Maybe it's common in a quick bite restaurant, one girl in the kitchen was touching bacon and she used the same hands without washing to cook other stuff. Is it safe if she's also touching buns? Burger was good and fries were delicious!! I wish they weren't out of grass-fed beef burger. Hopefully next time!"
"Another one of the places I'm catching up on doing a review for within the last 1-2 years, since I took a little break from this site. The burger was definitely not bad and I appreciate they cook to whatever your preference is(even rare or medium rare, and as I'm a medium rare guy). For the prices they were charging, I was expecting my meal to be a tad better than it turned out to be.I don't know if this problem has been fixed, but the ventilation system for their kitchen felt somewhat inadequate the one time I visited 1-2 years ago(whenever it was...), and the worst I've noticed at any place since when I used to occasionally go to Gaztro Wagon's storefront. If the weather is nice enough, sit on their patio instead. That said, I'd still give this place another shot, knowing to be prepared for the ventilation issue beforehand."
"Summary: Upscale, BYOB, counter-service burger place with unique customizations (sriracha mayo, duck egg), bottled/canned beverages, and fairly ample seating in somewhat close quarters.I came in here on a whim while shopping on Armitage Ave. I'm a fan of the recent trend in upscale burgers, and I'd heard good things from others.As mentioned, you can customize a burger in many different ways. You start off with your choice of protein (beef/pork/turkey), a spice blend (you can do cajun, umami, etc. I went with the simple black pepper and kosher salt), a choice of several free toppings, followed by the premium toppings. Here, I went with the sriracha mayo and a duck egg to go along with grass-fed burger.The burger was cooked to perfection, and the duck egg gave it extra fatty richness. The fries were equally delicious, with a very pleasant crisp. A ""small"" order is honestly big enough for two people. I felt the prices were a little high for some of the items ($2.25 for a sauce?), but you will get excellently prepared food in an intimately comfortable space."
"Called ahead to confirm closing time. Was told 10 PM so we thought great, as  it was about to be 9 o'clock. Anyhow, turns out the place was closing so we were the last customers. Marc (must be a manager) was very personable and assisted us with the menu. We ordered the house blend and fries. We all thought the food was exceptional. Juicy burgers and hot fries what more could we ask for?? Dessert of course! We ordered beignets. I've had melt in your mouth beignets. These were not like that. No worries. We came for the burgers anyway. So glad we dined here. Our trip to Chicago would not have been complete without it!!"
"There is nothing like building your own burger from the start! If you're indecisive, the ordering is the tough part. You order from the counter and they have it ready for you in about 10 mins. I absolutely love this place. It's also BYOB which, nothing gets better than that! It's a smaller restaurant, so I recommend to go in a small group or with a friend, or go during Summer when their outdoor seating is open. I've eaten here a few times, and have no complaints! Everything is fresh, and flavorful. Make sure to come hungry and share that order of fries!"
Have been here numerous times always helpful with your order and what to get. Good service fast and great food :)
"Let me just say that this burger joint deserves to be spotlighted on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives. The ambiance is great! It has that butcher shop feel to it.   The staff was great with suggestions regarding the different meats, seasoning and toppings. I had the bison burger and it was the bomb! The taste was really enhanced with the seasoning. The side of fries were seasoned just right and complimented the burger. My only gripe  would be for the price I would have liked a bigger burger. Thanks for a great meal."
"I had really high hopes for this place. Not to say that it wasn't good, but I just expected a lot more.Now with their products being natural grown, it's pretty expensive. For 2 burgers & 2 drinks it came out to around $40. I thought my burger was good, definitely not worth $20 though. But if I went again I would probably get my burger medium rare. I believe I got medium well and it tasted like it was well done"
"Dude. Really good tall grass beef burger at the Butcher and the Burger. I built my own burger with a croissant bun, blue cheese, goose egg, bacon, avocado, and truffle mayo. A bit messy but very tasty. Really get the quality of ingredients come thru in every bite. Good food but there were a couple of things that I think they could of done better though. Bacon wasn't crispy, the egg white wasn't fully cooked (which made the translucent white pouring out of the burger unappetizing), and the fries we ordered were way to salty. Would come back again to try their other burgers and breakfast sandwiches."
"Showed up at 9pm, place is scheduled to be open until 10pm - guess what? It's closed. Boo.Could revisit if they ever stay open during all of their posted hours, and I can actually try the food.  Guess my tip is - show up early?"
"Best custom burger that I have found in a LONG time.  Custom choices for seasonings, and where rare means RARE!  Woo hoo!   Chefs that actually get it right when doing an awesome burger...no gray matter to be found.  I would have had a second burger and skipped the fries, and definitely skip the beignets....those were disappointing."
"A friend saw that the restaurant was highlighted as one of the ""manliest"" restaurants and recommended that I try it.  Fortunately I came mid Saturday afternoon and there was no line.  There are lots of options to choose from and you could get an extra spicy burger (which is probably why it got the title).  I went with a straight burger with just mustard, tomato and mushrooms so I could truly enjoy the burger.  The burger was tasty and a perfect medium well done.  The cole slaw was very good.  A nice stop if you are in the area but not someplace you would travel a long distance to try."
"Butcher & The Burger is a Chicago burger joint offering the ability to make your own burger, or pick from one of their popular options. I ordered a classic cheeseburger on my visit featuring cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, beef, pickle, and a flavorful beef patty. The burger was well executed with a tender bun, flavorful beef + cheese, and tangy pickles. My only change to the burger was removing a little bit of the white onion and adding ketchup & mustard (since the burger comes without sauce on top). The tomato and vegetables on top of the burger were a little immense and took away from texture of the package. However, the top quality ingredients and flavorful beef make this one of the better burgers in Chicago."
"Got via postmates, so don't know about service, but the burger...WOW.Specifically, the Grass-Fed Beef Burger (medium) with:-Bun: Split Top Butter Egg Bun;-Cheese: Goat Cheese;-Spice: Umami (fresh garlic, ginger, scallion, black sesame seeds, sweet soy glaze); and-Extras: Black Truffle Aioli, Caramelized Onion, Fried Egg, Sauteed Foie Gras.WOWOWOWOWOWOWOW.  Best burger I've EVER had."
"Man that's a good burger. I got a bison burger with the Cajun spice rub and some cheddar, pickles and mustard. Simple, perfectly cooked, and delicious.The customizability here is insane. Between toppings, meats, spice rubs, cheeses and breads, there must be tens of thousands of combinations. The fries are also excellent, and we also got a special shake which was an apple cider shake. Tasted like apple pie a la mode but as a shake. Awesome. The space is nice too: seating is definitely limited, but if you come with just one or two people you should be able to find a spot either at a table or the bar seating. Only complaint I had was that there was a LOT of mustard on my burger and their mustard is very good; and very strong. Clears your sinuses. Next time I might ask them to go light on the mustard."
"I was very impressed with this place. Somehow I'd never heard about it until last night, so my girlfriend and I decided to give it a try. Unfortunately, the place was packed so we decided to get takeout. The girl that took my order was very friendly and was especially helpful in helping me order. When I got there to pick it up, the entire staff was equally as helpful and even let me know that a seat had opened if we wanted to stay. When we got home, the burgers were still great and extremely impressive. Though the burgers were great, they didn't really stand out from a lot of the other top burger places I've been to (not that it's a bad thing - plus we got takeout so it wasn't fresh off the grill). Also, the fries left a lot to be desired, but again, we got take out. Nevertheless, I'd definitely recommend this place to everyone I know and will be back soon."
"Third trip to BatB this past Saturday night.  This burger is still great but not in my top ten; it's also not as large as I remember it when I first tried it last winter.  As it is (maybe a 5-oz. slab), you will need something else to go with it to leave the restaurant full.  The fries are the best thing here, and a small fry is definitely enough for two people.  The $6.50 shake is too expensive for the quality; tasty, but not as good or as thick as Bite Cafe, Elly's or DMK.My main knock here is the space; each time I have been in, someone at the low tables facing the door has had the (not) good fortune of having food, a guest, or a guest-carried item knock into them.  The space is really strangely laid out, with a couple of high tables, some counter seating along the wall, then 3-4 low tables.  Bigger people moving in and out of the table area...well, it's just a comedy to watch.  If I lived closer, I would always do takeout here, because no matter where you live, the space at home is better than the space inside BatB.Service was once again friendly and fast.  See you again in Q4...need to make a commitment to trying the non-burger sandwiches on the menu."
"So I've only been once and maybe I need to go again, but this place was just ok for me.  It's definitely WAY overpriced for just a burger place.  For 12 dollars or more I expect a more tricked out burger experience in terms of toppings.  I ordered my burger medium well (a crime to some I know) and it was definitely completely medium.  Having said that it was fairly tasty.  The fries are nothing to write home about but they're serviceable.  I will say that I was surprised to find a seat on a thursday night around 7.  Staff was ok.  Could do with a little more space as I pretty much had to bump into everyone in the place to get in and out of my seat.  Might get a slightly higher rating, but those prices can't justify."
"So many options so little time.  This place was great.  You get to choose everything on the burger down to the seasoning.  So if you do not like your burger it's your own damn fault.I went with a pretty basic burger just to see what the place had and it might have been the best burger I have had in a long time.  Nice a  fresh, you could see parts of the chopped up cow in the fridge's window.  I got grass fed burger, with cajun and Chicago seasoning, bacon, onions, ketchup, mustard, and pickles.  Cooked perfectly, with fresh cut fries, not included.The burgers are not too big, honestly with a small order of fries and the burger it was plenty to eat.I am going back, but no allowed to order beef.  Need to try something new like Pork or Bison.Take a chance and try something new on your burger, this place is the good place to go to give it a try."
"I ordered a traditional burger and fries. Making decisions makes me panic so I went with a safe bet. And? It was everything. I was so very pleased with the burger I had. I will be more adventurous next time, and I'm sure you can't go wrong with just about anything on the menu! Guess what else? Checking in on Yelp gave me some money off on the Frozen Custard. I had already had ice cream earlier that day. But am I going to pass up a discount on frozen custard? Maybe when hell freezes over...Recommending the coffee flavored frozen custard to anyone who will listen. A nice little endcap to a wonderful meal.Let's not forget that this place is BYOB! That's the best part!Seating options are limited as dining space is kind of small. I hope to find myself in line for a burger, fighting for a table, with a bottle of wine in tow in the near future."
"If you're one of those people who like to rant about service, I get it. (Just ask me about United Airlines!) But today I'd like to rave about Butcher Burger.I'm very pleased with the atmosphere of Butcher Burger. And owner, Marc Duchossois, is superb! The service he provided was quick and accurate as well. My experience at his restaurant was exceptional. I will definitely return!"
"Definitely the best burger I've had in Chicago yet.  I had a simple burger with the house blend beef cooked medium with american, mayo, ketchup, mustard, lettuce and pickles on a split top bun.  I usually like my meat pretty pink so I was unsure whether to get medium/med rare.  I went with medium and it was a good choice.  It seems like medium rare may be pretty rare here.  I believe they make their own pickles and they are amazing!  Tasted slightly bread and buttery and added the perfect sweetness to my burger.  Shared a basket of fries with a friend and they were perfectly seasoned as well.  Thick cut and not too crispy or soft.  I will be back to try out their other options and deserts."
"A contender for the best burger I've ever had!I got the House Blend Beef (medium-well) + Cajun Spice + Pretzel bun and fries. It was love at first bite! The burger was cooked to perfection and the spice blend gave it so much flavor that it was like mini orgasms in my mouth. The fries were very good too.. crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, with the right amount of seasoning... Mmmmmm....I also like that the burgers are served on wood boards. Nice touch!The only downsides are that the seating is a little awkward as you have to choose between a cramped inside area or a patio area that is sloping so much that you worry about your food sliding off the table. Also the ordering process could be a little intimidating for first timers as you basically pick everything that goes on the burger from the bread to the meat to the toppings. Overall though, I would highly recommend B&B to anyone in the area that is hungry. :)UPDATE: Went here 2 more times and left thinking that this was the best burger i have ever had on both accounts. I have no choice but to upgrade the rating to 5 stars!"
"So glad I was finally able to stop by Butcher & the Burger! What a unique burger joint. Came by with the boyfriend around 8:30 on a Saturday night and had no issue getting a table. I had been so excited about the fact that this is BYOB, only to be incredibly disappointed that I couldn't bring my beer outside, inside seating only with alcohol. The inside is well-decorated and I can see how it gets super crowded here at peak hours.Butcher & the Burger is counter service, which makes it difficult to get anything once your food is served, but the waitress that took our order at the counter was very friendly. Additionally, this is not the restaurant's fault (obviously), but I was overzealous in choosing my toppings. Just too much. It's easy to do with so many appealing options, but I would suggest keeping it simple. The burger was massive and incredibly juicy, when cooked medium-rare. I added the cajun seasoning and it was a TON of flavor, but didn't go so great with all of the veggies and condiments I added. The whole thing ended up being a bit of a sloppy mess. The fries are delicious and come as a separate side, nothing actually comes with the burger. This, unfortunately, makes the experience a little expensive. I understand we're at a gourmet burger place in Lincoln Park, but over $30 for two beef burgers and fries seems a little steep. Overall, very glad I came by, definitely worth checking out!"
Lovely place where you can make your own burger whatever way you like. And for desert I absolutely loved their Vanilla shake! It was awesome! Would go again!
"I could bore you with a lot of fancy food jargon but all I need to say is that these people construct an awesome effen burger! The meal I had was just a really #$%^& good meal! It was just a really good burger. The all-american burger and  fries w/truffle mayo=a very happy customer! I actually have always hated mayo but this is the only place where I would be willing to eat it with pleasure.The space is small but it's a nice looking place. I would have to dine-in during off-peak hours. The staff was very nice too. The only issue I have is that I asked for my burger to be well-done and it wasn't but honestly after biting into that bun and that meat and those toppings, I'm not so sure that they can do any wrong! It was well worth the trip and I cannot wait to return!"
"Butcher and The Burger is a great addition to this neighborhood.  I love all the options they give you, especially the grass fed beef, which can be hard to find.  And although most burger places allow you to customize, I've never seen one that even lets you pick the seasoning for the meat!  Big shout out to the lettuce ""bun"" as well - by far the most well constructed, easy(er) to eat lettuce-based burger I've ever seen.  I will say that my burger always ends up being quite expensive, but I guess I have a penchant for expensive add-ons, not to mention one of the pricier meat options."
OMG! Alpaca.nuff said.
"Outstanding.  Literally, the best burger I have ever had.  Seating is tight but it's not a worry.  Excellent staff and product.  Thank you."
"Great place, no dollar menu! Spent 40 bucks for two burgers one fry two drinks. Burger was supposed to be well done, gave it to me medium well!"
"My wife and I went on a Sunday. Ordering is a bit confusing, but it was not packed so no issue taking a couple minutes to figure it out. My burger was solid, but my wife's came out medium rare, but she ordered it well done. She is pregnant so can't eat rare meat. They did it again and it came out rare this time. Not sure why they could not cook a burger well done."
"I've lived in Chicago for about 3 years now and have tried all the burger places my native Chicago friends told me had the ""best"" burgers.   I grew up on a cattle farm in the country so burgers were a staple growing up.  I can honestly say this is my favorite burger place in Chicago right now.  The food and atmosphere of the place is great!  I'll be back for sure!"
"Butcher & The Burger is a high quality Lincoln Park exclusive burger spot that focuses on unique options. Unfortunately the downfall of B&TB is the same reason it's so great. High quality means HIGH PRICE, and unless you're willing to spend A LOT of extra cash on a burger, avoid this spot.This little local burger spot has blown up recently after being featured in a lot of magazines and news papers. It's combination of great fresh ingredients, ability to build your own burger however you want, and small neighborhood feel has given it a huge following and a glowing reputation. But ultimately, I come to a burger spot to get a burger and fries for under $10. Imagine my SHOCK when after ordering the ""classic"" American burger with a order of fries I get hit with a $13 bill. What? This isn't some gigantic burger you can't wrap your hands around, it's actually on the small side. Even the serving of fries is nothing huge.Creating a unique burger is great and all, but even a simple combination of things I would want on a burger would push the burger alone into the $15-$17 range. I love Bison burgers, and of course they are always pricey, but a completely plain Bison burger is $17 by itself. Don't try adding all the extras you'd want cause now you're easily spending close to $25.... for meat, vegetables, on bread.Let's get past the price point and talk about taste.The burger is decent. Not the best burger I've had, but you can definitely taste the great seasoning, the wonderful charcoal character, and a fresh variety of vegetables. What really stood out were the french fries! Absolutely delicious! If I ever go here again, it'll be for a order of fries and to try the custard.Bottom Line: Does this place necessarily deserve only 2 stars? Not really. But I feel the prices are completely out of my range for a burger that doesn't blow my mind. And even if I was feeling a burger, this wouldn't even be in my top 5 Lincoln Park spots to go to for one."
"This place is awesome! I've only been here twice (within the same week!!) my first experience was amazing. As good as it gets. Best burger I've ever had. I made my own, it was cooked to perfection, the seasonings are unbelievable and the fries are to die for.I was stuffed to the brim and so happy I had found such an amazing place!I took my friend back a few days later, and although his burger was amazing, mine was not. It was overcooked and was missing some of the toppings I ordered. I requested the same seasoning as my first visit and it tasted different this time. This was a Saturday night, so it was slammed, our food took forever and they forgot about our dessert. All understandable for a Saturday night. I recommend visiting on a week-night as it's difficult to find a seat on the weekends (very small place) and it's hard to get a burger recooked if needed.It could also be a bit less pricy, but again, if your burger is the way you ordered it, it just may be the best you've ever had, so worth it."
"I came here with a group of 5 and we got a table right away no problems on a Friday night at 6:00 so we lucked out. This is honestly one of the top 3 burgers I've ever had. There's just so many different choices on the menu and at first I felt a little overwhelmed, but eventually I just got a bacon cheeseburger on a pretzel bun with caramelized onions. It was delicious. I also selected the Chicago sauce to be mixed in with my burger, awesome choice.The place is small, but we lucked out with getting a big table for 5 people right away. I'll definitely be back!"
"I thoroughly enjoyed their prime burger medium rare. And it actually was done right ! Smoked Gouda with bacon and truffle mayo is Da Bomb!  I love that the egg topper is free before 1pm.Killer lunch ........Back again, 7/2/14, like an addict ...... (In a good way)....."
WOW what a great find I was in the city with my buddy and we were hungry so we came upon this Burger place. Great service the people there explains their menu and everything was fantastic.
"The burgers here are very good, perhaps among the best in the city.  The location is small but the service is great and it is definitely worth going out of your way to visit this place."
Soooo good! I ate my burger too fast to take a photo for you... Must get the black truffle mayo!!
"These people really know what they're doing when it comes to burgers. My friend and I came here today and I had, hands-down, one of the best burgers I've ever had in my life (the other being Kuma's ""Minotaur""). I got a regular burger done medium rare on a split top bun, with the 'griddled' onions, the ""Grandma's onion soup"" spice mix, blue cheese, and bacon, and it was absolutely divine. A winning combination.That said, do yourself a favor and try their more special/unusual ingredients. For instance, I was very glad I got the blue cheese and that spice mix. I'm sure a plain burger with the usual tomato/onion/American cheese is delicious here, but if you experiment instead and make more exotic choices like the shrimp or salmon burger, the wasabi mayo, or get avocado or a fried egg on top, you will be in heaven! My friend got the bison burger and loved it.The fries are also fabulous. Most people in the restaurant seemed to have ordered the larger portion (which will cost you a little over $5). Seems worth it if you're splitting them with someone and you're hungry. My friend and I were okay with the smaller portion, but we totally could have eaten more of them.For dessert, we also got some of the custard. One of the special flavors today was cookies and cream, and it was CHOCK FULL of whole Oreo chunks and crumbs, which is how I think cookies and cream things should always be. I hate when I order something Oreo and end up mining around for a scant few precious chunks of Oreos in the midst of endless spoonfuls of plain vanilla ice cream. Well this was different, in a good way. The only thing was that it seemed a tad expensive ($4.50 for just a small but satisfying cup of the custard... it was very good, but I don't think it should be nearly $5)Aside from the food, the decor of the place is also really awesome without being pretentious. I think they did a good job choosing all the chairs and building materials, decorations, etc. Even the bathrooms are cool, with marbled subway tile walls and neat tiled floors. Very clean, good service, yadda yadda... this place is great and I can't wait to go back!!"
"Went there again recently as I do love the burgers. Everything went well this time and things came out as ordered. Extremely tasty! My date's spinach salad, however, was very small and also served on the butcher block. It was a side salad at best at a dinner salad price. Stick to the outstanding burgers!"
"Got the grass fed burger. Chicago style steakhouse seasoning is overpowering. Fries, though fresh, were nothing special. What's good is that it is all's freshly made, but overall, it's really not that great. Beignets by no means great either, bit of an odd taste, don't know if its the dough or the oil."
"I am always happy with restaurants that have smaller portions available...and  not on the kids menu! We are over served with portions in this country and it's quite gross.So, for a smidgen over $10 I got a junior cheeseburger, fries and a diet coke! In my eyes, the burger was huge and not lost in the bun (I've had ""where's the beef"" moments at other places). I got to choose the spices I wanted on top too. Oh! And the beef is grass fed. What more could you ask for?My only disappointment was the fries. I asked the cashier who sat next to me on her break if the fries were hand cut in house. She said yes. Well, to me they certainly didn't taste that way. Maybe it was an off day as other people have raved about their fries to me.two money saving things to point out: 1. They are on the Belly Card program. If you don't know what it is, go there and check it out or download the app on your phone. It's basically a rewards program for local businesses. 2. If you use the Yelp check in feature on your phone you can get a free fried dough thing (has some fancy french name to it)."
"The food here is sooo delicious, and they'll help you pick good options if you panic from all the choices. I get the salmon burger with double goat cheese and unami spices and I always leave feeling I could die very happy. It's an awesome location and the vibes are good, but the downside is the place is SO small. If you enjoy eating at eating times, you'll stand in a line and maybe get a table. I wouldn't bank on it for a group. Summer's the best time to come, when they have additional seating outside."
"WOW!  What a great experience!  I went there with my Mom and her boyfriend since he likes burgers.  We were extremely happy with all three of the burgers we ordered.  Can be a bit overwhelming at first since you select your protein, seasoning, bun and toppings.  They also have a few select burgers that you can choose from.  We told the cashier it was our fist time and she was so excited it got us even more excited about the experience.  The food came out really fast too! Only feedback would be that the chairs are not very comfortable.  They also have a nice patio.  We sat inside, but would choose to sit outside the next time.  Not only are their burgers and service awesome, their fries are a must try too! I look forward to coming back!!"
"My first time here was last weekend, n I loved every tiny bit of this experience. It's small n cozy, very comfortable to spend pure quality time with ur friends, staff (the cashier) was very nice and helpful. And the burger was FUCK!!!!! AMAZING....for burger lovers out there, u need to b there once in a life time (at least). Beautiful burger, I loved it, feels like I want to stop time n save the moment with every bite, it's this kind of burger than u need to close ur eyes with every bite n just focus on this piece of heaven u r munching."
"I ordered the grass-fed beef burger rubbed with the Umami spice (scallions, ginger, garlic & sweet soy), topped with wasabi mayo and bacon on a pretzel bun and, I must say, it was one of the best burgers I've had to date. It's no Kuma's, but it is simply delicious, with the most focus being on the meat (beef and bacon both), rather than amazing and outrageous flavor combinations. The service was also excellent, with even the chef coming out to say hello."
A group of 5 of us went and were able to hover by a table that left before our food came. We all ordered the regular burger but I got mine with the egg bagel and goat cheese. Sooo delicious! Make sure to order a side of fries and beignets if you have room :)
"Went here looking for a great burger with awesome ingredients and a little creativity.  I can't remember the name of my burger but it came with an egg and a great cut of bacon.  The bread was fantastic and the vegetable ingredients (lettuce, tomato, onion) were fresh and crisp.  Fries were an excellent complement.  Overall, the preparation was great.  The burger was cooked perfectly, and the location is very quaint.  I enjoyed the service and the people operating the shop.  I'd highly recommend for a top quality burger that won't empty your wallet."
You can get your burger exactly how you want it! Something for everyoneVeggie with umami = :) Next time I'd try a lettuce wrap though because that bun was huge and covered the awesome deliciousness of the burgerReasonably priced and fries good as well
"it's pretty damn cute up in here.  here's how you do:1/ pick out yo' meat 2/ pick out yo' meat done-ness3/ pick out yo' meat seasoning4/ pick out yo' bun (reg, pretzel, wheat, lettuce?)5/ pickle lettuce tomato?6/ throw some fancy shit on dat patty?7/ fries, yo?it comes out on a cute little wooden cutting board thang.  totes adorbs.  the burger has always been juicy, tender, and delicious.  the burgers aren't gigantic, but enough to get you filled up.  service is great, too."
"I was really hyped to come here and was really hyped up as I heard of this place being listed in Manliest Restaurants of America. I'm not a Manly chick but I was intrigued and the location is really near me. I ventured off on a warm summer day and was greeted by the really nice staff. The space itself is cute and charming, similar to the other places near the  Armitage and Webster aves in Lincoln Park. We sat outside in the cute patio and waited a bit for our food to arrive. I decided to go for one of the pre-arranged options that had a shrimp  patty (yes, funky, but I've never had a shrimp patty before!) umami spices and wheat bun. It was o.k. Too overpowering and the burger kind of made a mess everywhere. the fries were also just o.k. but the cookies and cream custard was ammaazziinngg! I would go here again JUST for the custard. It really hits the spot on a really hot Chicago summer day. I probably picked a weird array of items (shrimp burger? who was i kidding) and maybe would've been better off with a salmon or veggie burger but oh well. I believe every item on a restaurant's menu should be solid, or just don't have it on there. Either way, it may take me a long while before I venture off into this place again."
I went for the beignets and cafe du monde coffee and stayed for the burger and fries. The neighborhood is also a plus in my book.
"Cashier is challenged tonight.  This place is great.  Food is always delicious, and I love that it is BYO.  On this particular night the line was super long due to a new employee on the register.  Not her fault.  Classes are really fun too!!"
"What a ripoff ! My burger w / fixins (Grass fed,egg on top, etc.) $24.45! I mean good night Irene.Good luck finding their ""beignets"" on the napkin ... about a fourth the size you'd find in New Orleans. These silver dollar sized lumps cost a dollar each.The fresh ice cream made every day ? A small dab at $4.50. That is a lie. The waitress told me last time laughingly it was 4 days old.I don't mind paying for good food but this place is a SCAM. Add a few things to that already expensive burger and watch your bill skyrocket!Chef Allen sent a bunch of stuff over to our table we didn't ask for and then charged us.  A  $11 shrimp patty burger? Yuck! He did this to us at his last failure ""Allen's"" too. It's called thievery Allen. This is his little game. He pads the bill and then acts shocked when you confront him. Does he take it off the bill? Nope! ""Oh, so sorry! so sorry, I'll take care of you next time you come in.""Oh, there will be no next time Allen you sweaty little liar of a man.He's a talented guy but just so slimey THIS is why he keeps failing. It's never too late to do the right thing Allen. And if you did the right thing you could actually make eye contact w/ your costumers and wouldn't that feel good?"
"Disclaimer: 4 stars for the food, 2.5 stars for the service...The burger and the fries were probably one of the best I have had, but the service on a busy friday evening was yet to be desired. Don't get me wrong, the servers were extremely friendly in taking order and delivering order, so then what was wrong? Well, all of us have never gone to this place before, so for those who hasn't ""studied"" the website beforehand, it could be a bit confusing as what to do...then given the shop has been around for a while, they should probably have the system down for a busy night/rush hour, esp....i would assume they would have experienced even busier nights before....Anyway, so they had the buns of my burger with my friend's mixed up since we both had the bison with egg. then all my toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, etc) were all missing...glad that the ones i paid for were there :PAt first, i thought i didn't call out individual toppings, so they probably didn't put them on...but then after i thought about it, i remember distinctively looking at the board when i called out each specific toppings and remembered ordering the cooked onion...anyhow...no big deals...but would be nice to have some veggies on my burger :)The place was small which i didn't know, so it was really stressful to get a table for our group at a busy night like tonight..we were sure if the food would come before we got seated nor there was any park nearby to take the food to.....glad it worked out...."
"Great burgers and beignets. I got the turkey burger, which was really moist. My girlfriend got the normal burger and it was also excellent. I really recommend the Wasabi mayo. The Siriacha mayo is a little lacking in flavor."
"I considered subtracting a star because I really think they should reconsider their ordering process, but everything else about our experience here was so outstanding that I just couldn't.  There are lots of decisions to make when ordering (meat, bun, toppings, seasonings. . . ) so it takes a long time to place each order and the line backs up.  I think their menu would be ideal for the checklist tablets where you just check all the boxes you want and turn it in.  But the food came out surprisingly quickly,  they have a serve yourself water(and coffee and iced tea) station, and the staff were exceptionally nice and helpful, so I'll forgive the long line.  Also, the burger I had (bison, creek bottom seasoning, cheddar, bbq sauce, smoked bacon) was absolutely, without question, the best I've ever had.  We even bought a bottle of the seasoning blend to take home and share.  I also really love that they serve beignets and the chicory coffee from Cafe Du Monde.  I will admit that it is not cheap.  We had 2 burgers, 1 beignet, and 1 pickle, and paid over $40 (after tip).  But it is so worth it."
"First time here and I ordered the pork burger. It was great. The seasonings were perfect, cooked well & juicy.  My only complaint is the pickles are sweet & I like regular dill.        Another first time customer ordered the turkey burger & also had good things to say."
"This place was great. After surveying foodies in the area this was one of the top three highest recommended burger places in Chicago. Was not disappointed The food overall was exceptional (5star). The menu is organized in such a way as to provide you with near limitless customization. Enough classic staples and interesting ideas to keep you excited about trying a whole new combo next time. Food quality was great. Flavor/rub was good and not overpowering, which for some would be excellent, for me it was a chance to taste the quality of meat but I personally would have preferred a tad heavier. But overall not a ding, Tip: they have the rubs open on the counter to smell before ordering. The buns are a great touch especially want to try the lettuce next time. I prefer to keep carbs to a minimum. Lol at a burger and fry place but whatever. The fries were also very good. Not sure what they were fried in but it was good. Think of a drier five guys type fry.      Price point was exactly where a premium burger should be. You can really load it up and pay quite a bit or keep it simple which is reasonable. Fries can be split due to size of burgers. Or you can pig out on tasty fried potatoes.    Inside and out the atmosphere is exactly what you would want and this place really is a 5 star but the place is SMALL and BUSY. Not sure if next time I get there there will be seating within a reasonable wait for Saturday lunch etc. That's the only reason its getting a 4 star. And I'm star stingy. Lack of confidence in finding seating. Everything else is good. Pretty sure it is BYOB.PS the quality of toppings, from cheese to bacon to aoli etc was EXCELLENT. Better than expected for price."
"I just wanted to update and let everyone know that the manager here did contact me about some of the issues we had with service. He was very gracious and professional and I do understand that things can happen sometimes. That said, aside from any previous issues, the burgers really are solid.  I will definitely give it another try."
"Awesome burger!! Patties (several types of meats available) are made to order with your choice of spice (a bunch to choose from). The burger was HUGE. The size of my face. It was nearly impossible to fit it into my mouth. They were served on a cute cutting board, which was fun. Fries were good too. Also got some beignets, and the staff actually ended up giving us two extra just because! Everything was super fresh, super yummy. I also loved the staff. They were super friendly and helpful with ordering. Hope to be back sometime to try some more combinations of spices and meats! I played it pretty safe this time around, so definitely need to be adventurous in the future."
Great burger! Prices are a little high but the quality of food you get makes up for it.
"Great burgers and excellent fries! Friendly helpful staff and  nice atmosphere make this a nice spot for adults. No screaming kids, etc...wonderful selection of burger spices, buns and cheeses, great fries, cole slaw  mmmmm. Byob."
"I went the other day with friends and was surprised at the quality of the burger. The restaurant is super cute, the toppings to build your own burger are interesting, and the guy who took our order was really nice and gave advice about what to pick. All signs were positive. However, when we got our burgers they were almost completely raw. I'm saying that as a person who ordered medium rare and likes a good amount of blood in my meat. But this wasn't even bloody meat, it was just uncooked in the middle completely. And as they grind their meat very finely, it mainly tasted like mush. My friends ordered their burgers medium and found them cooked at the exact same level as my burger. The cooked onions on my burger were also super, super greasy. Combined with the raw burger, the mouthfeel was just really off. All that said, I probably just went on an off day. I would absolutely try it again, and their delicious French fries pretty much saved the meal."
"Perfectly cooked burger and really nice staff. We had two separate conversations with our servers about the beer we brought (BYOB). I had a pretty simple burger with cheese, bacon, and a fried egg. They must use really top notch ingredients, because everything melded so well together. Really a great burger."
Grass fed beef salt pepper cheddar cheese bacon caramelized onions lettuce tomato fried egg black truffle aioli pickles on a split top fries Mexican coke.....goodnight!
came on a weekday and it was great! we orderedavocado sandwichpork sausage sandwichprime burger - BEST! thick and juicy and flavorfulfreshly squeezed orange juicy - SO GOOD!completely different experience! i think due to the fact that it was not overwhelmingly busy and the staff is absolutely wonderful! will come back!
"I created a Yelp account just to write this review.If you like shrimp, make your next meal the shrimp burger at Butcher & The Burger. OMG. It is amazing. I came here with my boyfriend and I finished my shrimp burger before he was even halfway into his beef burger. It's that good.They have a shrimp option on their menu, but I went with the create-your-own option and got wasabi mayo, blue cheese and umami seasoning. Get this combo and you won't be disappointed!!P.S. for those who do not like shrimp, my boyfriend enjoyed his beef burger. We split a large order of fries and those were fantastic as well. FYI--seating is limited, so you may want to get that shrimp burger to go or come with a small party!"
"Small fries are big enough to share. Burgers are heavenly. Super friendly, wonderful staff. Only downside? A bit pricey. But what else do you expect from Lincoln Park?"
"I read about Butcher & The Burger a few weeks back on Tasting Table and immediately add it to my To Try list.I like simplicity in ordering so I was a little disappointed by having to select spices and buns, but the staff was grateful to offer first-time suggestions. Had to go with the grass-fed beef but went out of the box with the onion soup mix. Skipped condiments but added cheddar cheese.I've had many-a-burgers and would say this is in the Top 3, if not the best I've ever had. The fresh cut fries were exceptional as well, but may be best shared with a friend.Not sure about the whole meat market aspect, I saw they had to-go seasoning but the cooler up front looked a little sparse. There was a sign about classes and the manager was gracious enough to talk about their offerings and offered a peek at the hog for their upcoming butchery class. (Hoping to come back in Feb for Surf & Turf class!) Great service. Great decor. BYOB."
-1 star for price....Hamburgers Great! Try the truffle mayo with fries!
"Short answer: Arrive on foot. (It's in Lincoln Can't-Park). BYOB and BYHA (i.e, Huge Appetite).Hadn't heard of this place. Not normally a burger person, since as a low-carber I must skip the bun but can eat all the steaks/chops/fish I can afford. My singing partner & I had just finished recording a podcast down the street and were ravenous. He's a burger fanatic. He cased the 'hood and saw the upscale vibe and had resigned himself to eating at a tollway oasis en route home to Madison, but agreed to walk me to my car. On the corner, I said, ""That looks like a coffeehouse--maybe they have food."" When we got closer and saw the word ""Burger"" we practically ran into there!First thing I noticed was the lack of credit card decals on the door. Dunno if they take plastic, as we had enough cash on us. Though it was about 9 on a Thursday, we were able to squeeze ourselves and our guitars into a high booth along the wall (while we were ordering, a floor table opened up so we took that). It's counter-order/waiter-delivery. Looked at the chalkboards and into the meat case and realized I'd walked into a carnivore's wet dream.  If it can be slaughtered (or caught or harvested) and butchered, they've got it and can make it into a burger. The ""All-American"" prime beef house blend with the works was less than a sawbuck (four bucks extra for a slice of foie gras). I picked the Chi. Steakhouse seasoning (one of many choices) and opted to swap out chevre for the standard American slice. Asked to skip the bun, and the cashier replied, ""Oh, you must be low-carb. Want a lettuce bun instead?"" Said lettuce bun was two generous iceberg lettuce cups.  My partner ordered the bison burger, well done, with fries. I was nonplussed, since he's a beef (and occasionally salmon) eater and none too adventurous. Both burgers were gargantuan and insanely delicious. He got a Mexican (cane sugar!) bottled Coke and I unsweetened iced tea.They have a little reference card illustrating the color of the burger's interior for each degree of doneness. I normally like mine rare, but saw the size of the patties, the color chart, and chose medium-rare. Mine had the outside nicely charred, a thin layer of rare beneath, and a huge center of essentially steak tartare, But with beef like that, steak tartare is da bomb. I suggest going one-to-two degrees of doneness more than you usually order, as except for well done it's hard to do burgers this thick uniformly.Terrifically eclectic soundtrack--everything from hip-hop to bebop to punk to klezmer.And to torture this poor low-carber, not only do they serve fresh frozen custard but also Cafe du Monde chicory coffee and fresh beignets!"
"Big price, little flavor. Had high expectations for this place but the burgers were mediocre. This place has a great variety of burgers and has a veggie patty option for vegetarians, which is great.  Good area, nice restaurant on the inside but couldn't get a table after waiting more than 1 hour."
"Oh. Wow.Don't know what else to say.If the burger wasn't amazing enough, the chocolate shake was to die for. Oh, the fries were also incredible.Seriously, there are lots of decisions to make at this place, and  they are all great choices, which makes it even more difficult. Fortunately, the staff is knowledgable, friendly, helpful and patient. There are a lot of great burger places in Chicago, but this is my new favorite."
"loved the variety of customizable options! burger comes out exactly as you order it not mention really juicy. not huge portions but just right for me. the place is relatively small and has a very chill neighborhood atmosphere (at least it did on the Sunday we went). i definitely recommend the ""grandma's onion soup"" spice. sadly no beer to go with my wonderful burger but who really needs that?"
"That I can choose my own meat, seasonings, bun, and toppings appeals to the control freak in me. That the resulting burger is delicious makes the greedy ass in me very happy.I'm loving the whole choose-your-own-adventure aspect of this place, which means I'll be back for a number of adventures.  They've also got a truffle mayo that I'm all about buying by the jar (yep, it's available that way). Easily one of my new favorites places for a burger.  If you want some beefy or chickeny or turkey-y or bisony or lentily (yes vegans and vegetarians; there's something for you too) goodness, I suggest you get yourself to this place."
"I'm OBSESSED with these burgers. I get a prime beef with Chicago steakhouse seasoning, goat cheese, tomatoes, caramelized onions, and a butter-top roll. It's AWESOME. The fries are insane - just the right amount of crispy and soft inside. The staff is super nice... I'm a big fan of this place."
"Burger with an egg.  It's a ""choose your own adventure"" kind of menu, or for the less risky route - they have set menus as well.  I chose my own route and ended with the egg...let me say...best. route. ever.This place is legit for a burger joint in the city."
"Re-reading my review from last time, based on what I wrote, I probably should have only given this place 3 stars.  Well,  my second visit was worse.  My burger was dry and again overcooked.  Maybe they just shouldn't ask how you'd like it?  My wife and I each ordered ours medium.  She received hers medium-well, and I received mine well done.  The fries I had been excited to have again really disappointed me this time. They were overcooked, dry, and lacking seasoning.  Two employees asked how our food was, and we should have been honest, but we didn't have long for lunch that day and were worried it would slow us down.Aside from the food, I think it would make the ordering process a lot easier if they had the burger building options as a list of steps on the menuboard as opposed to how it currently is with subtle headings over each section of choices."
"I love this place.  We usually get our staff lunch from here a few times a month and no one has ever had a bad experience.  Chef Al and his crew offer great food, awesome customer service in an intimate atmosphere.  Great place to hang!"
"This place is kind of a hidden gem for ""best burgers in Chicago"". It's a perfectly cooked burger and a nice patty, no thin patty crap. Fries don't look too appetizing, but they're really good.Not much seating, but they also have a cool outdoor patio. BYOB TOO!!!!"
"Best Burger in Chicago so far! I always get the grass-fed with the backwoods bottom creek seasoning on a split-top bun. With small fries (which they give you PLENTY of) and a side of truffle mayo. DO NOT forget the truffle mayo! It changes the taste of everything from delicious to OMG delicious! The burger size isn't TOO overwhelming so you can definitely finish it! The service is always great, and REALLY helpful! Its right off the brown line, so no excuses! Try it!"
"Such an incredible restaurant.  They're doing everything right.  I was just exploring the area around Armitage with my girlfriend when we happened upon this gem.  When we walked in and started looking at the menu, the man behind the counter could see we were a bit perplexed, so he offered to explain it to us.  He made sure we knew exactly how everything worked and gave us several recommendations.  Everything sounded so delicious, but we finally decided.  We each got a burger and a we split a large fry with truffle mayo.  We chose to eat outside, although inside looked pretty nifty as well.  Our food was brought out to us on these really cool cutting boards with the logo on them.  Every bite from then on out was pure heaven.  The best burger and fries I've ever have.  There is room for user error though.  There are so many options that you could go wrong with your order.  I suggest just asking the extremely friendly staff for their recommendations.  They know what they're talking about.  They also give discounts to DePaul students and staff!You've got to make your way over to this delicious eatery."
"This is everything a good burger spot should be! Our party sat down and it was all our first time being there.  While trying to get a run down on the menu, Mark came over to help us seeing our confusion on the menu.  He was very welcoming and helped make our decisions! You could tell he had the passion for restaurant. I got the reg burger with Chicago steak seasoning with bacon!  It didn't disappoint! The rest of the party had a lamb, turkey and lettuce wrapped burger and there wasn't one complaint! I enjoyed the fries that we also ordered with it! Nice and crispy.  I think this place beats Kuma's and Lockdown hands down as far as burger places go."
"I had an amazing time at the Butcher & The Burger last night! While I was a bit concerned that our large group of 9 would have a hard time finding a spot to sit together, we ended up taking over the high top tables along the wall and made ourselves right at home. We lucked out coming a bit later at 9pm so the dinner crowds were filtering out. This is a fantastic place to go with a group because you pay up front at the register so there is no need to worry about splitting the check. The food itself was great, excellent burgers, although I'm a bit disappointed in myself that I didn't branch out more. Looking back I wish I had tried one of the seafood burger options, guess I'll just have to come back! I stuck with a more traditional burger, house blend beef, grandma's onion soup mix, blue cheese, and sautéed mushrooms on a pretzel bun with a side of fries and black truffle mayo. Got to love any place that doesn't shame you for ordering a side of mayo with your fries. Our group split a large platter of beignets for dessert which we drowned with the wine and beer-o-plenty we brought along. (Gotta love BYOB) I wish there was an option for dipping sauces for the beignets- chcoclate, jam, etc. But really I can't complain. As for price, I know a lot of people are complaining, in my opinion this place is very fairly priced because of the BYOB option. YES the burgers are a bit on the pricey side if you start ordering all sorts of craziness on top. But with some thought you can easily find a decent burger option for under 12$. And for goodness sakes split the fries."
"Almost feel bad with more than 400 reviews, can I add anything new? Faced with the realization of working from home and that if I didn't stop here after a job, it was back home to the weekends leftovers, I decided it was worth a stop. I kept it pretty simple with bacon and avocado, but it was the bacon and the beef that made this burger pop! And yes the fries are pretty spectacular too. I also went for the lemonade, will have to dig a bit more about what they do, not overly sweet, nor bitter, but yet strong... very nice! The decor is pretty nice too and the young guy (I'm just getting old) at the counter was super friendly as well. Funny discussion about pop-culture and the differences in our generations. Definitely worth a return."
"Excellent burgers! They offer all super fresh ingredients, and you get to choose the entire build of your burger! Oh, and it is BYOB without corkage fee! How could you not love this place?I recommend going with the beef. Anytime I went with anything else (shrimp, salmon and turkey) I wished I had just stuck with the beef.You definitely pay over $10 bucks for burgers (usually $13-$16), but they are delicious!Seating is VERY limited, so off hours are your best bet if you want to eat in.It's a blessing and a curse that we go to church right across the street because every Sunday we walk by for the free smells (sorry Jimmy John's). If it were up to my husband we would go there every time we walk by...but we do show some self control...sometimes."
"I was going to give Butcher & The Burger  three stars, until I saw it meant ""A-OK,"" so I had to go with ""Meh.  I've experienced better.""  I had wanted to experience this highly touted ""burger joint"" since they opened, but I just don't frequent that neighborhood.  So, when Blackboard Eats offered a 30% off deal, I jumped on it.I stopped in on a Saturday in early July.  As soon as I entered, I saw a layer of smoke extending halfway down from the ceiling.  I almost didn't go in, because it looked like they had a hood malfunction, but I saw a couple dining in there, and the waitress/hostess was eyeing me eagerly from behind the counter.I decided to sample a couple of their items.  I got a breakfast sandwich with scrambled egg and sausage on croissant.  The sausage was interesting (quite unlike most breakfast sausages, with an almost andouille quality).  However, the egg was unevenly distributed on the sandwich, as was the cheese, and it was in serious need of basic salt and pepper.I also got their signature burger.  Everything was ""fine"" except that I ordered a rare burger, and it came out medium well (and since I got it to go, I didn't realize it until I was in my car, and didn't feel like going back in and waiting for a replacement ... time is money).  The burger had a nice texture, but it is inexcusable for a place that specializes in burgers to confuse rare with medium well.   Blech!The most epic fail was the fries.  The waitress/hostess had gone out of her way to tell me the double-frying process that they used.  As a cooking instructor, I know this double fry technique increases the probability of getting a crispy exterior with a creamy interior.  I'm not sure what happened, but my entire order was SOFT!  And it wasn't because I got them to go, as all I had to do was walk out their door, across the street, and into my car before I could sample them.  Based on the comments below, some people must love soggy fries, but if that's what I wanted, I'd buy a bag of Ore-Ida and fry them at home.Maybe I misunderstood the concept, but I thought once could also get all sorts of butchered goods and charcuterie.  Maybe I'm spoiled by Rob Leavitt's Butcher and Larder (yes, I AM spoiled), but I thought their display case would have all sorts of carnivorous goodies for purchase.  There were a couple of items, but nothing looked too interesting.  Thankfully, I don't have to go out of my way to visit this place again.  Live and learn."
Definitely one of the best burgers I have ever had! There are so many different options to choose from so go wild and try something new. I would definitely recommend the pretzel bun and wasabi mayo. Pass on the mushrooms if you don't want a super messy burger. Fries are great but the small portion is definitely enough for two people. The place has VERY limited seating so be prepared to stalk people for their table. It seemed like the turnover in tables was decent on a Friday night such that no one was left standing with their food without a place to sit... But we did have to wait awhile to sit down after ordering. Would definitely recommend coming here with only one or two other people or else plan on taking your food to go because it will be impossible to find a table for a big group.
"This was one of the best burgers I've had almost ever. You place your own order and then hope to get a table. The fries were ok - the burger was divine. The female cashier is super sweet and helpful - and her zest for their food makes it all the more exciting to get your food. It's a tiny place, so go on an off day or get their early."
"One of the many boutique burger joints in the city that has me coming for over 2 years. This is in an excellent neighborhood that befits the restaurant. The place can get packed and please adjust for wait time. I am a fan of places that have their menu on a black board and do take recommendations if lost trying to order your burger. I have tried their Veggie and Salmon with a variety of spice rubs and other extras but the Umami flavor on the salmon is my favorite. If available they will also serve Elk and Bison as well and you can go all in for the Foie Gras. Wait, my review cannot stop without mentioning the breads for the buns and I always pick the Pretzel bun with fried egg on top of the protein overdose.This place is BYOB so you will encounter folks who take their own time at the table regardless of the queue, so patience will help in reducing frustration or if you are like me, just stare at the ones who stay put at the table for real long time. Their fries are ok and I would skip them and just enjoy the proteins and not worry about the carbs. This place is definitely one of my top favorite joints in Chicago."
"Good ""build your own burger"" joint. Lots of choices from meat to seasoning to cheese to toppings. The space can get a little tight if you hit this spot up during lunch rush. Fries are also pretty ridiculous. I ordered a turkey burger and it got pretty soggy/sloppy as I ate it. Nothing worse than having a soggy bun with all the good stuff squirting out everywhere. Maybe they just need to use better buns here. Great fresh tasting burger, especially recommend if you are the build it yourself type. Byob."
"Yum-o!We ended up at Butcher & The Burger after a looooooooong night of drinking.  I was looking forward to ANY food at this point, but I'm glad we ended up here.I wasn't sure what to get at first, but after perusing the menu a bit, I ended up getting the house blend beef with the umami spices on a split top butter egg bun with cheddar cheese and a fried egg.  Hubs and I split an order of fries.Let me warn you now... the servings are HUGE here.  The food is awesome but omg, I could NOT finish it.  It doesn't help that this place is BYOB so of course, we brought a LOTTTTTTT of beer.  The meat was so tender and juicy!The service was great and the location was fab.  The only thing that I would change is the amount of smoke inside the restaurant!  It got to the point where I was having a hard time breathing."
"There's so many good reviews of Butcher & The Burger, but honestly, I was a bit disappointed in my meal.  Considering you choose your own rub, my burger didn't have much flavor to it at all.  I would give them the benefit of the doubt and say maybe I built the wrong burger, but the cashier helped me pick out my toppings and such!  Beyond the burger, this place is SUPER small.  I went on a week night and it was almost stressful competing with the other people coming in for a table.  It's one of those situations where you dart your eyes back and forth, checking out who's almost done eating and who's walking in, and where they're at in line to order.  Just way too much work!"
"Easy to find, and delicious burgers! I got the one with the goat cheese. Took my sister here for her birthday and there was a wine shop down the street that gives discounts on certain wines if we are dining at Butcher and the Burger, so even better! Only drawback was a little bit of a wait but otherwise, it was worth it."
"Best burger I've had dining out. Great selection of meats/seasonings/cheeses/toppings. Burger isn't too big, but it's not too small.Staff was real friendly and helpful, overhead them eagerly explain seasonings to customers and give opinions on which combos go well together."
"Butcher is home to one of the better burgers in Chicago, attractive through the wealth of possible configurations in its build-your-own model, its frozen custard, and a long list of things you can add onto the mess of a sandwich. Not sure why they have to distinguish between grass-fed and normal beef (is it not local/grass-fed?), but that was nice, too. Bison burger is getting pretty pricey at $14, but it is what it is.Last time I was here, they took awhile to bring out our salad (forgot to put in the order-- even though we still got it as we finished our burgers) and the guy was so apologetic that he gave us a free large order of beignets. Super nice and the beignets were pretty amazing-- larger than what I've had in St. Louis or New Orleans, so six is probably two much for two people, but they made a great breakfast subsequently.I can also safely say that this is one of the more attractive spaces I've ever been inside in Chicago. It's not so much breathtakingly aesthetic as it is so intentionally designed-- the walls are mostly cladded in beveled marble subway tile, which is pretty sick, and the bar seating along the western wall is marked by stool seats that swing out from metal contraptions. Pretty cool. The bathrooms also boast some pretty gorgeous tile work. Feels a little bit more original-- a little more steampunk, perhaps- than the ""reclaimed barn wood"" aesthetic, so that's refreshing.My one complaint? Not exactly a place to eat on a budget."
Great burger and fries!  Awesome service!!  Went with grass-fed and worth the extra money.
"Walked by on my way to PAWS and said  OOH FROZEN CUSTARD! Walked by again on my way home and said OOH BURGERS and thus I was sucked in.It was one of those 100deg days, and the place was boiling hot, especially since this place draws unending crowds. We ordered at the counter and sat near the window to take advantage of the air vents above.Our burgers came out, enormous and daunting but inevitably conquered by our appetites. I actually did have to take the top bun off in order to fit the burger in my mouth. We polished off every morsel of the super juicy burgers and the mountain of hot crispy fries. Including the delicious sweet pickles and addicting horserasish mayo I got on the side.As for the merp part, I can't say I tasted much of the spice rubs we were able to choose, however (we had cajun and umami), though the beef itself was flavorful enough. The server also tipped the plate so the mayo fell all over bf and me.. :( And they charge for water.A little hint on the hot-ass days... their bathroom is STRONGLY A/C-ed."
"Had the best burger of my life here. It's build your own so here's what I did: grass fed prime with umami spices, split top egg bun, goat cheese, foie gras (very generous helping), caramelized onion, and black truffle mayo. I had grease running up my cheeks and down my arms in all it's gloriousness. Ordering it I'm thinking, this will be too rich, but somehow it wasn't. My date was rubbing her burger in my leftover ""gravy"", sopping up all those juices. It was even dirtier than it sounds. I felt like an evil genius, and there's so many other possibilities. The chili cheese fries were good I thought. The beignets were different, breadier than I'm used to, but good. I also had my first ever chicory coffee and loved it. In the end the biggest testament to how good this place is: My girlfriend's son who never eats or finishes anything, ate every crumb. I was blown away."
Good burgers and fries. Prices are a little steep for burgers but they taste good.  I had the bison burger and was really impressed. They have a great variety of buns and spices to choose from.
"Got here a little early for breakfast and they still let u in. Had a gilt city for 2 breakfast sandwiches and 2 coffees. The choices are avocado, egg and cheese; bacon, egg, tomato, and cheddar; or sausage, egg, grilled onions and cheese. All on croissants. We chose one sausage one bacon. Both were sooo good but the sausage was our favorite. The party was a good size and had a great, spicy taste. The coffee was also very good. Would definitely go back for a breakfast sandwich.198/365"
"Waited 45 min for food after paying and putting in our order in, only to find out the kitchen (3 feet from the register) never got it. Couldn't wait, going to a game at the UC, so had to cancel the order. Disappointing..."
Best burger I had in Chicago yet. When you ask for MR they make sure it's done to perfection with their fresh meet - full of flavor!
"I still really like B & B but I think the ordering process could be improved a bit.For instance, we stopped in last night around 5:30 for dinner and there was a long line. I'm okay with that, it just seems that taking one's order involves a million questions and the two girls ahead of me apparently had to be schooled on what a burger was, because it took them almost five minutes to place their order. Perhaps there's a way to have order sheets when you walk in and you could circle all your options and then hand it to the cashier (a la The Counter)? Might may things move faster.A couple other things: when you ""check in,"" you qualify for a free beignet. Now obviously I want my beignet after I'm done with my burger but in order for that to happen, I have to get back in the line again to order it, which takes forever. While I was in line, there was a woman who had placed a takeout order (I'm thinking what a smart cookie she was) but again, she had to wait in line for 20 minutes while her cooked food sat there getting cold and soggy. Kind of defeats the purpose, no?I logged on this morning and saw she had written a rather scathing review and I can't say I blame her. If I had paid over $20 for two burgers, I'd want them not to be soggy and gross too. So perhaps B & B should figure out a workaround or maybe not offer carry out at all; somehow Smoque manages to let folks who've placed carryout orders bypass the line so they can still enjoy food that hasn't been sitting there.That said, the burgers are still delicious and worth putting up with all of this, just be prepared."
Crazy good food. The burgers are always perfectly made and the fries are some of the best I've ever had.... Ever! Minus one star because the venue is way too small for the amount of customers they cater too. Time to look for a new storefront! Otherwise this place is my go-to burger spot in Chicago.
"Awesome place for a hangout with friends. Not a huge burger person(since I don't like a lot of meat) but friends wanted to come here so I was all for it....thing is there was a good 15 of us, so you can only imagine our faces as we walked in this small joint. There is a patio area and we asked for it to be used, but since it was kinda gloomy out, workers didn't want to...whomp! We made the best of it! I made a great creation, but forgot what i made! oh yeah, BYOB TOOO!"
"From my two experiences going there, I think that Butcher & the Burger is fine, but I wouldn't go out of my way for it. I think part of why people enjoy it is that it is BYOB, so that is naturally a plus. For me, the potential cost savings on the drinks kind of contribute then to the burger price. As other reviews describe in more detail, you walk up and select the components of your burger, which I think other people enjoy. I, personally, feel a bit overwhelmed by all the options (meat, bun, seasonings, free toppings, not-free toppings), and, again my own fault, have been a bit underwhlemed by my result. For example, yesterday, I got a regular beef burger, butter top bun, steak seasoning, grilled onions, tomato, lettuce, Swiss cheese, and ketchup. It ended up costing over $10 and just tasted fine. Maybe the seasoning is my downfall, but last time I got the onion soup and I felt like it tasted about the same. Both times I've gone, I've shared the French fries with a friend, and they have been so good. They have skins on them and some seemingly sea salt crystals. I've heard the custard is good but haven't tried it. There is a Yelp offer for $1 off, if you check-in on your phone.The restaurant itself is very small. I didn't have to wait yesterday, but it was -14 degrees out or something. The other time I went, there were just two of us, and while I think we squeezed into a spot without waiting long or at all, it was so very crowded. I lost a glove behind the booth/bench where we sat. I knew when I walked out, but I didn't want to crouch behind people to try and get it. The location of being very close to the Armitage Brown line stop and a few blocks from Halsted makes me think I may end up back here. I hope I pick a better burger combination then or go with one of their trusty ""favorites"" on the chalkboard wall. I better bring at least $15 and a bottle wine to hopefully create more of a 4 or even 5 star review experience."
"I came here earlier this week and my burger was great!! The burger I got I can honestly say was the best burger I've ever eaten, but the only reason why I did not give this place five stars was because I ordered French fries and they were way too overly salted. Definitely won't order those again."
Great burgers and BYOB!
"This is a matter of personal preference. I like a thicker juicier patty than what they serve here.  If I'm gonna pay $9-$10 for a burger I want juice dripping down my arms.  I also don't want to make 25 decisions before getting to eat that burger.  I just want to order it and have it be delicious.  That said - the ingredients are fresh and crisp and very high quality. On to the fries. They were of the thick cut, skin on potatoey variety. They were very good, would have been great with less salt. The best decision I made here was the truffle mayo to dip my fries in. Thank you Brits for mayo and fries!!"
"For a Chicago burger bar, it's another good choice to try and could make it into anyone's burger list easily but would it top any of those lists, I think not, not mine.  Well not yet anyway.  I like the idea behind it because having a choice on beef and meats for a prepared burger and the ability to purchase uncooked meats for home is unique.  Having a choice in the flavor or spices added to the meats before preparation is cool as well but where's the flavor?  I've tried it twice with choosing two different types of meat and spices per occasion.  The meat was quality and if that's what you desire do your burger plain with minimal toppings, so you can revel in the meats flavor.  The spices were nowhere to be found, so I wonder if you could ask for a double portion added, so that the taste is more apparent.  The fries were perfectly prepared and I like that they serve meals on wood boards.Both times I spent around  $15 dollars on a burger, fries and drink.  I wish they offered more drink options since that's the direction a lot of places are going these days.  Like Fentiman's ginger brew or another compatible brand of ginger beer.  Foo foo burger bars should have more foo foo options is all I'm saying.For now, there's no reason to go running out the door to try it right away.  It's a small spot and on busy weekends you can wait up to twenty minutes for a seat to open up. It's pretty cozy and the seating could almost be communal since conversations can get meshed.  I might have at it again but with the plethora of burger bars, maybe not.  Oh yeah they serve beignets, well maybe I should stop by for those at least."
"I was quite interested in checking this place out after seeing and hearing reviews about the food, specifically the hamburgers. Well, we got there and I decided to go balls out and got the works, hamburger, cheese, bacon, fried egg etc. etc..The smell was perfect, the texture exciting and a taste was fantastic. I don't usually order $14 hamburgers and felt somewhat guilty about it, although that feeling was silenced once I tasted the fries - damn.The place is supposed to be wheelchair accessible - bullshit. So, we took our order out and ate our food on a picnic bench by the ice cream shop down the street. Maybe it was better eating outside, but still.Anyway, this is not an everyday thing because I would weigh 200 pounds and be living out of a box. But, from time to time, this place is not a bad spot for those hamburger cravings."
"Another gourmet burger joint in the city. Pretty pricey for smaller burgers compared to others out there, but they do taste delicious. The staff is helpful and friendly. Highlight - they have Mexican coke!"
"Every time I have gone in here the wait staff has been amazing!  They are constantly giving me samples, talking about their favorite items and being overall adorable.The food is pretty darn good too, one of my favorite burgers ever.  The meat and the ingredients are top notch and the burgers always well proportioned.  I tried the foie gras once on a burger too, worth trying once, but you will definitely need a nap afterwards.  A good trick is to try their truffle mayo as a dipping sauce with their fries, yum!The thing that clinches it for me is that they do desserts well too.  Their beignets are fluffy and prefect for a snack or with a cup of coffee in the morning. Oh, and the homemade custard?!?! Worth it! They had banana last time I was in, such a good end to a good meal."
"I'm always looking for a great burger, but this exceeded my expectations. Service was great and the bathroom was clean. As a restaurant owner and operator, I have very high expectations in those two categories. If the bathroom is dirty, the kitchens always dirty. I had the bison burger, which was cooked to perfection, but a 20 dollar burger better be that good. I can't complain too much about the price, since I added goat cheese and avocado to a ""bison meat"" burger. Perhaps it just seems pricey to me in a world of fast food feed lot meat. Without a doubt, top 3 burgers I've had in Chicago so far. :)"
"Beignets and coffee!  Promise me Beignets and coffee and I will follow you anywhere.  These beignets brought flashbacks of hanging out at Cafe du Monde. They were the real deal and with the powdered sugar all up and down your shirt to prove it.The croissant bacon and eggs sandwiches were pretty damn tasty as were the avocado and egg vegetarian version.  They also had some samples of sausage that everyone seemed to dig.  I'm not a sausage eater so I had to pass. Beermosas?  I've never heard of this but I'm never one to turn down any alcoholic beverage no matter what time of day it is.  They were citrusy and fun and went well with the bacon and egg sandwiches.Butcher & The Burger is located in a very cute area of Lincoln Park.  Lots of shops nearby if you want to go and browse after Brunch. My favorite part was meeting new Yelpers.  Finally got to meet Rachel H. (one of my faves), Elise K. , Lizz M. and Gary.  Always great to see my accomplice Vanessa U.Thank you to Johnny, Yanyao and Linda for a great party!  You guys are awesome.  Thanks to Butcher & The Burger for being so generous and hosting us.  The whole staff was uber friendly and attentative. Can't wait to go back with my friends and family!"
"The only reason I didn't give Butcher & The Burger five stars is because most of their seating is along the wall, bar-style, with totally cute but uncomfortable pull-out benches. And though the dude taking our order at the register was super accommodating and nice, there's really no service here. They bring you your food when it's ready and then you're pretty much on your own. It's BYOB, so come prepared.That being said, I ordered a bison burger (a bit too expensive) that I'm still thinking about over twelve hours later. No joke, this may be the best burger I've ever had. I feel horribly guilty saying this because usually, I'm a very loyal DMK girl. But I've recently cut WAY down on carbs and so DMK burgers are a bit too thin to order without a bun. This bison burger (sans bread) was served on an iceburg lettuce bun. Genius. It was refreshing and crunchy and cool. But then the burger was perfectly cooked (medium, as I ordered it) and it was juicy and unbelievable. I went with caramelized onion and avocado for toppings and damn, was it delicious. Also, the guy taking our order was very knowledgeable about ingredients and was happy to help me avoid specific things.If I hadn't gotten bison, the price would have been WAY more affordable. If you like mouth-watering burgers, you better try Butcher & The Burger. Not to be missed."
"Dear Butcher & The Burger, thank you for the BEST veggie burger I've had in my entire vegetarian life (16 years of meatlessness).  Came here with the hubs for the first time today and loved everything. We came from dinner, but B&B would be a perfect lunch spot.  It almost has the feel of a coffee shop - very laid back, big picture windows, homey, great for people watching on Armitage. No wait for a table Saturday at 6 pm.  Staff was nice and provided recommendations for what to pair with my vegan lentil brown rice burger. I got the cajun blend spice, whole wheat bun, grilled mushrooms and onions, and goat cheese. The ""lentil brown rice burger"" sounds unappetizing (I admit) but having eaten loads of lentils and rice, I don't think it tastes like that..it tastes more like a very flavorful, curry couscous patty or something. SOOOOO. AMAZING.I did not want my burger to end.Our fries were awesome too. Crispy but soft in the middle, and seasoned just right. Hubs got the grass-fed burger with all the normal fixins (ketchup, mustard, mayo, lettuce, etc.). He rates his burger 4 out of  5 stars, great taste, prepared perfectly (medium) and he could tell that the beef was top-notch quality. He would have given it five stars had it just been a little bit bigger. I think this is our favorite new spot!!"
"*Chomp*Why did I come here?I stopped into Butcher & The Burger as my friends had tried the place for lunch and absolutely loved it! Pre-gaming before Whirlyball, Butcher & Burger was filled with Friday night hungry diners enjoying some BYOB while waiting for their food. In line I got a good view of the menu which made me hungrier with each passing second!What did I try?The thing about Butcher & The Burger is that you'll have an array of options at your disposal and they'll never get it wrong since the burger clerk punches your order into a neat machine.Patty:  Natural & Local House Blend BeefSpices: Chicago SteakhouseBun: Split Top Egg ButterExtras: Goat Cheese, Wasabi Mayo, BaconAdd fries and root beer and you've got yourself a classic Chicago meal. The dizzying array of choices gives you maximum control on what you get on your burger as opposed to some other places where you'll get a whole bunch of stuff and pick stuff off one by one.How was it?Firstly, the fries come out super crisp and weren't dried out. I don't know what they do, but every place in Chicago should take a lesson from Butcher & Burger and cook fries with this texture. Some garlic and lemon juice would have been welcome, but the fries were awesome!The burger was a test in discipline, could you go your entire meal resisting the urge to shove the whole burger in your mouth and consume in three bites?  While it was difficult, the civilized side of me refrained.  I had a seat by the cooking area and was very happy to eat quality ingredients put together to seduce your taste buds all made to order and served on a cute wooden chopping board.Butcher & Burger will give most places a run for their money with latitude to customize your boiga and crisp crisp fries as their best qualities. Had I been hungrier I would have tried the chorizo chili but I will save that for next time!"
"Based on the great reviews we decided to try this place in LP. Not a mistake, the burgers were good, parking is easy during the middle of the day, and the check-in offer of a free beignet made for a nice sweet treat afterwards.The place is decked out in period antiques, and the exposed brick walls give it an authentic Chicago feel.We had the House blend burger with the Chicago Steakhouse blend, the pretzel rolls, cheddar cheese, bacon and Hubby added a fried egg to his. The burgers were good. But, at $12 for burger as we had them, this wouldn't be a regular lunchtime haunt for us. Especially since that is just for the burger...fries are extra.It is clear that the owners were thoughtful in laying out there place.  Since this was our first visit, we did not know what to expect so we had to stand around for a few minutes while we figured out how to get seated and how to place our order. It was a tad bit confusing at first. Turns out you need to seat yourself at a table or along the wall, and place your order at the counter. I would recommend that you carefully read the wall mounted menu board before stepping up to the counter because there are many choices for meat, bread, cheese, seasoning blends, added burger stuff. Your experience will be pleasanter if you know what you want all around."
"Had that greatest burger here on a recent trip to chi town.  The flavors of all of the ingredients that they use are incredible!  Everything tastes fresh and amazing!  Love the pickles and the pretzel buns.  It is a truly unique experience when you can pick spices, the way its cooked and toppings. You can also get some NOLA favorites here! Don't skip the desserts!!!!"
"Consistent quality, friendly staff, awesome burgers.  (I like this place wayyy better than DMK.)  I love that their beef is grass-fed.  And since I don't eat much gluten, I order the lettuce bun (although it would be nice if they had GF buns like Grange Hall does.... ultimately it's not worth the schlep to Randolph and having to wait for a table... which is why I go to Butcher & The Burger instead).The space is pretty tight, but I've always managed to find a seat.  (Although not good for large groups.)Try the Alpaca burger if they have it on special - It's super tasty!I've been boycotting their fries until they get sweet potato fries."
"Stopped here on our way back from an afternoon at the lakefront, which is a perfect bike ride down armitage.  We walked in and were confused and overwhelmed by the options, but the cashier kindly and slowly explained: pick your choice of 8 proteins (there's regular and fancy grass-fed beef), then one of the spice rubs (6-8 of these?), then your bun (usual, whole-wheat, pretzel, croissant, lettuce), all listed on the left of the giant menu board, and in the middle are the toppings (free on top, more money in the middle).  We skipped out on fries but will definitely get them next time!If you aren't good with this sort of thing, there's four pre-customized burgers listed on a separate board, but none of them appealed that much to me.  Surf sounded interesting (shrimp, umami spice rub, wasabi mayo...) but since it was my first time, I thought beef would be the way to go.Mine:Regular beef Chicago smokehouse spicesBleu cheesesplit top butter egg bunlettuce, tomato, ketchupcaramelized onions (+$0.50)caramelized mushrooms (+0.50)Delicious!  Loved the char on my burger, playing against the soft butteryness of the bun, and the spice rub really makes a HUGE difference.  Should've ordered medium-rare but still great.  The BLUE CHEESE is *NOT* that strong- I actually thought it was mayo for a long time until I remembered what I'd ordered.  I appreciate that the burgers come out with a toothpick to hold them together and on a wooden cutting board with grooves to catch all the juices that were dripping out.His:Grass-fed beefUmami spices (soy sauce, ginger, garlic)Swiss cheese (I don't know why he chose this)pretzel bun (+0.50)caramelized onions (+0.50)lettuce, tomato, pickles, ketchup, mustardEven better than mine, though missing the char.  The umami spice rub made it suuuper juicy/messy.  The pretzel bun wasn't noticeably better than my boring one.  We believe in caramelized onions, and so should you.    If we'd planned ahead, we would've B'ed our own B, but instead just grabbed some self-serve water.  Make sure you ask for a water cup from your cashier because they weren't stacked back there.  Finished off with a s'more frozen custard.  Yelp has a check-in offer for $1 off, which puts it at a reasonable price ($3.87 or something) for a small cup of smooth deliciousness.A La Card has B&TB in it, so we got $10 off and ended up paying something like $15 for our two burgers and custard.  Next time we won't get the $10 off, but there *will* be a next time- so tasty!"
"Love this place!!1. Food- amazingggg. great burger choices, i had the shrimp burger which was cooked soo well, and the umami spice blend which was deliciousss. the wasabi mayo too was awesome- and you can really taste the wasabi. i downed the whole thing in about 5 minutes. and then wished i had a second stomach to eat another burger.  5 b/c they just had good unique options and very customizable and i was just so lit up when i took a bite!2. price/ value- fairly pricy b/c it doesnt' include fries like other restaurants, but the freebies (sauces, veggies, different breads, spices) more than make up for it so i still say awesome! 3. love the ambiance- so casual, but good food. love these kind of places. I will be back for sure!!"
Love the custom order burgers. You can get a burger pretty much any way that your heart desires. It's the best burger place I've ever been to in life this far.
"Ummmm THIS PLACE. Can we pause for a second and talk about how CU-UTE it is? Like, it's kind of like if a hipster dive bar and a 50's style diner made a baby, it might come into the world looking something like Butcher & The Burger. And I mean that as a compliment. So far, I can say that this place has the best burger I've had in Chicago. Now, I haven't been to Au Cheval yet, and I have heard great things about that place, but Butcher blows Kuma's, DMK, Epic, Indie Burger, The Counter (R.I.P.) and all the rest out of the water.It's amaze (which means amazing but it's so good that you can't even get the full word out). My burger was cooked to perfection, and the buns are just fab. The fries - I mean OH EM GEE. I wanted to like lick my little butcher block. And maybe I did just that. I just might have. Ok I totally did. Seriously go here. Don't even think twice about it."
"This place is simply awesome. I had the prime beef burger with steak house seasoning, avocado and bbq sauce on a pretzel bun. My boyfriend had the prime beef on the butter bun with the ghost pepper seasoning. We shared fries and the beignets. Everything was perfect. This was our second trip in three months. New Orleans was one of my favorite places. The Chickory Coffee and beignets were just like Cafe du Monde. I truly think this is one of the best burgers in the city. The only real drawback is that it is not kid friendly and a little smokey. Other than that, it's unique, fresh and features local ingredients."
"Great burger, but expensive! I had the House Blend burger with Chicago Steakhouse seasoning, carmelized onions and bleu cheese (lettuce, tomato and mayo also) on the pretzel bun. Fantastic burger. I ordered well-done but it was pretty pink inside. I heard them tell someone while was eating that they tend to undercook, so order up. Good tip. The burger was absolutely delicious. Also went with the homemade potato chip. They were good but pretty oily. Will do the fries with truffle mayo next time. $18.00 for my meal with a Coke."
"This place is incredible. My burger was perfectly cooked and the fries, pickles, and lemonade were great. My boyfriend ordered a medium burger and when his was cooked well done, he pointed it out and was given a new burger and a coupon for a free one next visit. When the next burger was well done, he was give another burger to take home and the cost of the burger was taken off of our bill. He was ultimately placed by an extra round of free French fries and the total of there free burgers he received - the service is absolutely incredible and they will do their best to help make your experience a great one. I'd absolutely go back."
"I really wanted to give B&B five stars, but I wasn't amazed by the experience. Don't get me wrong, it was a good meal, and if I was in the neighborhood, I'd probably go back. Here's my report:We came in around 1 Pm after taking a cab ride from Millenium Park. The fare was about 20 bucks; a 10-15 ride for 4 guys. I ordered the Grass Fed beef, and the girl at the counter suggested to get Grandma's onion soup mix along with it. There are a ton of combos available, but that's what i went with. I also ordered a giant Dill Garlic pickle... it was awesome.I ordered my burger medium well, and I actually wish I would have ordered it medium. I got lettuce, tomato, griddled onion, and ketchup on mine. THe burger was a good size, and it should be for around 10 dollars. My total order was 14.00, because of the 3 dollar pickle, the 9.50 for grass fed, and .50 extra for the griddled onion. They actualy forgot my lettuce, so I got some after about 3 bites in.This is a solid place for sure. I was disappointed that they had no sides besides salads and fries. I had some o fmy friends extra fries, and I also had a bite of my friends regular beef burger.Don't get me wrong, this is a solid place. I just didn't think it was worth it because we were near Tavern at the Park and Rudy's Bar and Grill while we were downtown. If you are in Lincoln Park, definitely give this spot a try. However, there's no reason to go out of your way to come here.I can't speak of the custard because I didn't get any, but I've heard very good things. This is a very small place! about 6 tables, and a counter to eat on. Those chairs suck to be honest, which is another reason why I can't give B&B 5 stars.The beignets also were getting rave reviews, but it wasn't bfast time, so no dice there.this was not lifechanging by any means... just solid."
"Our favorite burger place in the city. Thick patties, grass-fed beef, wonderful beignets and custard. And the fries with aioli are wonderful.Part of our love is probably that the first time we had it, we stumbled into it unawares while starving. So that totally shapes your experience, etc. Nonetheless, we have been back several times and still love and crave it.It is small, no alcohol, informal food delivery process. Be aware of that. Not an issue for us, but everyone's different.Also, this is a thick-patty burger (akin to Kuma's, but much juicier), so if you like thinner patties, you may prefer others. They don't have 10-15 predesigned burgers to select, so if you aren't good at making your own burger, ask for help, or at least be warned.To us, for a thick-patty, straight-up burger, this is the best in Chicago."
"That's one tasty burger!  A perfect medium-rare, perfect meat/bun ratio.  The burger looks small at first but on fill is just right.  They're a good looking sandwich, nice size you can hold it with 2 hands easy and bite into it w/o all the ingredients falling out like at some burger places.  everything holds together quite nicely.  Bun is soft yet holds up to the burger and toppings and doesn't get soggy w/o being overly doughy.  The fries are also good.  My only complaint is I was somewhat paralyzed by all the choices from patty, to spice rub, cheeses/topping, etc.  I stuck with one of the pre-made selections.Will definitely be back!"
"Since moving to Chicago less than a month ago from a city(DC) going through it's own burger craze, my brain and stomach had been telling me that it craved a non-traditional upscale beef patty in nestled in between some high quality breading and toppings done right.A mix of careful research of the extensive menu options and the simple convenience of a ten minute walk let me know that I'd be a fool not to give Burger and the Butcher the first crack at showing me that this city knows what it's doing.Even after game-planning my burger order in my head across the five categories (Patty, Bun, Spices, Toppings, Extra) the second I walked into their cozy and warm little counter space to repeat the magic words I had practiced in my head, my senses were overloaded with amazing smells and the charming chalk written menu that I imagine took a year to put on the board and I was stuck on square one.That's not to say that the options are too many without solid execution, the menu flows in a way that you start off with wonderful phrases such as ""Grass-Fed Beef"" and weave it into ""Burger on the Sun"", The ghost pepper blend that reminded my tastebuds of what they're there for, and before you know it you have a perfectly cooked medium patty with an evenly melted pepper jack,  A BBQ sauce that tasted like a real BBQ sauce instead of smoky ketchup, caramelized onions that added the perfect bit of sweetness, and bacon that wasn't thin and wimpy like the person eating it. All on the very trendy, very heavy, but extremely tasty pretzel bun.The staff was excellent and attentive, even with the large rush they had at the time. The burger and crispy fries that weren't grease heavy came out in about 20 minutes after I ordered in store during a very busy hour. The BYOB is a Chicago bonus that I'm still getting used to, as I came unprepared. Still, with the line of specialty sodas and Mexican Coke in the cabinet, I wasn't too upset about my options to wash it all down with.The only downside was my reluctance to walk back after eating such a rich meal, which isn't a complaint towards them as it is my own body.  The burger with special options, an order of fries and two ice cold cokes set me back about 20 dollars, but price wasn't a factor for me because I knew from the second I walked in I was getting something that justified the cost.This is the place that made me want to start reviewing places on Yelp! and they will certainly see me again."
"You want to know where the best burger is in Chicago? It's right here at Butcher and the Burger. Everything about this place is just on point! Unique. amazing quality food? Check. Awesome service from their friendly staff? Check(shout out to Sarah!). Trendy vibe? Check. Butcher and the Burger has everything you could ask for. Now for my recommendations: Ironically, the first thing I have ever had at Butcher and the Burger was actually not your typically burger. I had the shrimp patty burger with wasabi mayo and avocado. WOW! It was everything I was craving at the time and more. Everyone has got to try the shrimp patty, especially if you are a huge seafood fan. I promise, there is nothing like it. As for my usual, this is what I always get: -House blend-Curry/Coconut Honey-Split top butter egg bun-American Cheese-Grilled Mushrooms-Regular Onions-WASABI MAYO-Black Truffle Aioli on the sideWhen I miss all these together, I get the ultimate burger that rivals some of the best burgers I have ever had in my life. The perfect blend of curry coconut honey seasoning with the wasabi mayo is an urneal experience. Atmosphere is just as important as the food itself and the vibe of Butcher and the Burger is sweetly on par. You just feel cool eating here, and its on one of my favorite streets in Lincoln Park: Armitage. Butcher and the Burger is bound to be your new favorite burger joint!"
"The worst shrimp burger in Chicago it was so bland and disgusting. The shrimp tasted musky and not fresh. Just a few blocks away is the best shrimp burger, at Burger Bar. Save yourself and go there instead."
"Let's get this out of the way up front - the burgers are phenomenal.  Very well prepared and the options for seasonings and toppings are extensive - to the point of being nearly overwhelming.  While I really enjoy the option of an egg on my burger, I would caution that it borders on being almost too rich here.  In the future, I will probably skip the egg.The other great thing about this place is that it is BYOB and has a nice discount arrangement with The Poison Cup, which is just down the street and offers a very nice selection of wines and a small beer selection.  However, note that the patio is alcohol-free, so you'll have to sit inside if you want to drink."
"This is my absolute favorite burger place in Chicago! The ingredients are so fresh and it's so fun getting to make your own custom burger! Their hand cut fries are amazing as well! Plus their truffle mayo is to die for! BYOB so super fun to come with a group of friends and have an awesome meal! Owners are incredibly nice, so awesome giving them business! If you haven't been, GO!"
"Who does not love a burger? Wait until you see how many burgers there are.  With spices, the possibilities are limitless.  The fries are fantastic! I get mine with the no lard option and they are delish!  The custard is fabulous in the summer and ok, its fabulous in the winter too. I love going with my daughter who is 4.  They have kids sized portions but the same service and options of seasonings that adults get.  She thinks its the best.  My only issue is sometimes there can be a wait, but you seriously you discuss options that you never thought of while waiting. PS- We once ordered raw burgers for a friends BBQ they did not know they were having.  Best hostess gift I ever brought."
"I saw Butcher & The Burger featured on an episode of ""Manliest Restaurants in America"" on the Travel Channel that morning. I knew that night where my dinner was gonna be served. Walked in about 8 o clock 2/23/13 @ was greeted by co-owner Al upon walking in. He was very friendly and found seating for my friend & I  very quick.  My friend & I both ordered the Natural & Local House Blend Beef ($8.95) (Hamburger). One Burger was ordered Medium-Rare & the other Medium-Well. The Med. Rare Burger had Chicago Steakhouse Spice, Goat Cheese, Tomato, Ketchup Caramelized Onion on a Split Top Butter Egg Bun. The other was on a Pretzel Bun (.50 extra) with Cheddar, Tomato & Caramelized Onion. (Toppings were FREE too)Both Burgers were warm off the griddle, very tasty. I'm a BIG eater & could hardly finish mine.  Though, I managed! :) I'm a Burger Connoisseur & have had a lot of great burgers. These burgers were "" THE BEST EVER""!  Seating is very limited. Come early & definitely come Hungry!"
"Burgers for breakfast? Sign me the fuck up!Strolled in here looking like a disheveled version of last night, dying of hangover starvation. Luckily, we were seated immediately and given coffee. We sat at the counter, and the young lady serving us seemed... odd. It would be weird for someone to fake a southern accent just because they work somewhere that looks like a barn, right? I'm not saying that she was actually faking it, but paired along side her almost Stepford wife like smile - it's a possibility. Either way, she was super nice and didn't miss a bit, service wise, just a bit overzealous for my current state.Now, back to the burger. They served me a perfectly cooked (rare) burger, topped w bacon, egg and cheese, on a slice of raisin bread french toast and covered it with syrup! This is the stuff that a burger lover's dreams are made of. Salty and sweet. Breakfast and lunch. Seriously, perfection on a plate. The fella got something. Baked eggs, I think. I'm sure they were delicious. Our side of oven roasted potatoes were also great. Well seasoned, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside. I'm not super into urban country, shabby chic, or whatever you want to call the design concept - but that's just personal preference."
"3.5 all around~!!!!!!Beignets, Beef, Bison, Burgers, Buns, Brewed iced tea, Bar, BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!Went here for lunch after many months trying to get up here to check it out.I was here on a very smokey day.  One of the hood vents was out so it really was a smokey mess.  However, I had already made the trek to eat here.  I would weather the storm.The bison was AMAZING!  It was the first time, but it wont be the last.  Sorry PETA!  Please dont flour bomb me like you did Kim Kardashian.  I just cant help myself anymore.They have Belly here.  I was introduced to it for the first time.  I cant wait to get my belly on from now on in the city.There was a couple of glitches that I normally would be annoyed about, but I was catching up with a friend.  1.  My food didnt come out and I had to ask someone about it.  Slightly annoying because I waited extra long.2. & 3.  There was minimal napkin holders to get your messy little hands on.  I had to share with everyone sitting on the stools.  Almost no ketchup bottles anywhere.  Again, sharing with everyone at the bar.  Listen, I dont have a problem with sharing, BUT its a small place so getting up and walking around with my messy little hands trying to get napkins and ketchup was not fun.  Plus, I had to hip check about 3 people because I couldnt politely put my hand on them because they were filled with bison juice.4.  I checked in on Yelp so I was supposed to get a free beignet.  It also never came.  However, I didnt feel like asking again about it.  Got to save my butt a few calories anyway.5.  They have delicious brewed iced tea.  I LOVE IT!  However, you have to get ice from behind the counter, which again, I would have had to stand in line for about another 10 mins for ice.  I drank it hot the second time.  BOO!6.  Custard is there.  They had the wrong flavors up on the board so after I was all excited about getting a flavor, they switched them around on me.  Not the end of the world.  I would never turn down any kind of ice cream/custard/yogurt, but still.Overall, I would go back for some grub, but have low expectations for the service, etc.  You can purchase meat here.  It was in a very small case at the front.  Also, they had truffle mayo, etc.  YUM!  I saw a sign about cooking classes here.  I am not sure how that would work.  The grill area is all the way in the back in the skinny, narrow area."
"I love it when you call me big pop-paThrow your hands in the air, if you'se a true playerI love it when you call me big pop-paTo the honies gettin money playin *****z like dummiesI love it when you call me big pop-paIf you got a gun up in your waist please don't shoot up the place (why?)Cause I see some ladies tonight who should be havin my baby; bay-bee5 stars right from the bat since I heard Notorius B.I.G.'s ""Big Poppa"" on repeat while tearing into my burger.The Burger Butcher? The Burger & The Butcher?  Can't remember the name?  Just remember, the butcher came before the delicious burger=)Walked in on a slow Tuesday at noon for my red meat fix.  Very friendly and helpful at the counter when you order.  Step back and decide before lining up though.  Hungry people can be scary.  I should know.Step 1: Choose your protein.  (Everything from grass fed beef to a turkey patty)Step 2: Choose your seasoning. (Most popular being the Chicago Steakhouse-basic, the meat speaks for itself and its flavor is able to shine through but I absolutely loved the Umami Asian seasoning with its ginger, garlic, scallion, sweet soy)Step 3: Pick your carb. (Pretzel bun-extra 50 cent, whole wheat bun, etc)Step 4: Pick your condiments. (Must must get the pickle slices.  They were salty but had a sweet side to them too.  I could have eaten a whole jar full of the stuff).Don't forget to try their delicious beignets.  (I got one free for checking in on Yelp!)  They're so doughy and the powdered sugar sprinkled on top makes for a messy but sweet finish!Butcher & the Burger is definitely a pricey gourmet burger joint, but don't forget they're BYOB and DIY toppings.  They also hold a Monday night cooking & butcher class that I'd love to check out!."
"I was really excited to eat here because I've heard nothing but good things about this place. After eating here, I don't see what all the hype is about. My best friend and I made the trek out here because she and I love anywhere that has a create your own burger option available. Just an FYI for when you come here: it's a seat yourself facility and you walk up to the counter to place your order, which is brought out to you when it's ready. Having not been here before my BFF and I just sat there awkwardly until we realized that we had to go order at the counter. We went up to the counter and the girl who took our order was very polite and helpful. We both had a House blend burger with simple seasoning on a pretzel bun, with cheddar cheese and BBQ sauce. Two small orders of fries, two cans of diet coke and two burgers $36. It's a little pricey and I don't mind paying for a good burger. I don't think what I had was worth the price. We sat at a table by the counter and waited for our food to come out. There are only a few tables here so seating is very cramped and awkward. I did appreciate the fact that they were playing some sweet jams. I always love when good music is played. Our burgers were cooked medium well, which is what we asked for so that was great. However, the outside edges were pretty much burnt to a crisp, the inside was fine. The fries were decent. Some were perfectly crisp on the outside and soft on the inside but they majority of them were just hard, like 'Did I just chip my tooth' hard. I couldn't finish them. Would I come back here? Most likely not. It's a good place to go if you like super crispy fries or want to try different types of meat. In my opinion, it didn't live up to all the hype. The staff we interacted with were nice so they have that going for them."
"Love this place.  Been here multiple times and always had a good experience and a great burger!  Be prepared, it's small, but I one the neighborhood charm!"
"Good and tasty! I stopped by in the afternoon probs right when they just opened.  The burgers are pretty big and they have various flavors that you can choose from to build your own or select one of their custom burgers.  I got a pork and a beef burger about a month ago and do remember it being pretty good. Probably not the best burger I've ever had, but still pretty yummy!  I would come back, but probably not if I had to wait in a long line.I'd still recommend this place."
"Great burger joint. Not the best burger I've had in Chicago, but it's solid; better than good. Love the name, love the ambiance and how ""neighborhood-y"" it is. All the hand-lettered window paintings and chalkboard menus are extremely beautiful. Terrific signage.Love that it's BYOB and they have a recycle bin / waste bucket for your empties and last beers that you absolutely can't finish because you are so stuffed with burger and fries and drinks.I forget the name of the specialty burger I ordered, but I do remember what was in it: bison/bottom game/pretzel bun/bacon/bbq, medium-rare. Delicious and well-prepared. Bacon, bbq, and bison blended together boisterously.I didn't order fries, but mooched some off of my friend's community pile. Solid fries as well. Not too soggy/salty/burnt -- done just right.Would visit again to try something different."
"My favorite burger spot in Chicago. I have been here about 4 times in the past 2 years. I love this burger joint because it has high quality ingredients, spices, gourmet-like and BYOB. Plus the service is top-notch (they've added staff since last year, so service is faster). Here are my thoughts on a few burger combinations (meat, spice, bread):House blend, grandma's onion soup, croissant- the meat was cooked right and the spice is hearty-feeling. I chose croissant    for a change. It does fall apart easy, adds a great layer of butter taste to this burger.House Blend, ghost pepper, split-top butter egg- I can't really review the meat or bread on this because the ghost pepper is fire. I drank 5 cups of water while eating this. No joke. Try if you like very spicy food, but beware.Salmon burger, umami spice, pretzel bun- juicy, well-cooked, umami-spice is amazing.Beignets- if you've never been to New Orleans for the original, I suggest giving it a try since it's only a dollar. Side note: The prices are on par with other burger restaurants in Chicago (Kuma, Rockit, Bad Apple, etc.) so I don't feel like it's over-priced. If you want great burgers cheaper than $10-$15, go to Five Guys."
A must go for a great burger w everything being fresh. Great place for made to order burger. They also have seasonal menu items like iowa sweet corn. Will be making 5 his place a regular.
"Corner location on Armitage and Sheffield.   Fits about 20 people inside, but have a patio outside. Their menu is kinda confusing and all over the place.  I needed to concentrate on what it was that i wanted and made my burger the way I wanted. I got a burger with mozzarella cheese on a pretzel bun with lettuce, tomato, avocado and mustard.  It was good and filling!Fries came with the burger on a board - which was pretty cool. If I would be in the Lincoln Park area again, I would stop by."
Owner completely rectified the issue and has awesome customer service! I will give them another shot...
"mmmm truffle aioli = yum. I had the bison burger with swiss, carmelized onions and mushrooms... pretty darn tasty! fresh squeezed oj was yummy!"
"Thought this place was going to  incredible because of the extensive burger options and customizations (between the bun, type of meat, spices, etc) and it turned out to be above-average at best. However,  I will say that the fries were pretty fantastic and probably my favorite part of the meal (which is kind of a back-handed compliment).In addition, the portions of the burger and the milkshake were not very large.  But again, the amount of fries they gave me for a small was crazy (they just really do fries well here apparently).All-in-all I spent over $20 on a burger, fries, and a milkshake and they were all just good.  I wouldn't not recommend this place, but I also am not clamoring to go back."
This is literally the best burger you can get in Chicago. Used to live 5 minutes away and went there most days of the week. If your coming to chicago and you love burgers you NEED to come here!!!
"This place was just ok. Nothing was wrong with the food. I was just disappointed with the amount of money I paid for my food and what I received in return. I was excited to try the different seasonings, but the guy taking my order said that since I was getting the special that I could not choose my seasoning. Also, my fries were not cooked all the way. Everyone at my table said the same thing. My friend got a salad, and it was literally some pieces of spinach with some cheese. I'd much rather spend my time and resources elsewhere."
"I just visited this restaurant the other day and I LOVE it. My boyfriend has been having tooth pain and he ate his burger through the pain it was so good! Haha. This is a great little place, very cutely decorated inside and absolutely delicious."
Today I tried the bison burger with goat cheese and tomato... It was delicious! I love this place! *****
I can't begin to describe how cheated I felt as I left this burger joint. I spent 40 dollars for two hamburgers a large fry and 2 milkshakes for my girlfriend and I. The quality of the food was that of McDonald's so I was incredibly displeased to spend 40 dollars. My medium well burger was incredibly undercooked and it looked the same as my girlfriends medium rare burger. Also for 5.50 you think you would get a large milkshake but it was literally the size of a jimmy johns water cup. Total waste of 40 dollars and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone.
"There is absolutely nothing to dislike about this place.  Who doesn't like make your own burger?  I consider myself a culinary genius at ""make your own"" whatever.  What I get is 99.9% guaranteed to be better than what my husband gets....always. I started with a salmon patty with the umami spice on a pretzel bun with swiss cheese, wasabi mayo, and onion. MMMMmmm. Salmon patty was cooked perfectly. The wasabi mayo added a nice kick. It was perfection.Now, let's talk fries. Hands down the best fries I have EVER had in my life.  I could drink that truffle mayo. Truffle mayo milkshake? Yeah, I would totally order that. And the fries are crisp and fresh. Thinking about these fries makes me want to swear...in a good way. And a shout out for Mexican coke. The world is a better place because it exists."
Good burgers and not incredibly huge so you don't need to be rolled out after eating one. Try the smoked bacon on yours... It makes your burger taste like it's covered in Kielbasa.My only complaints... The small order of fries is simply too big for one person AND I literlaly only came here because I wanted beignets and was told that they only make then when they have all the ingridients for them. They should really note that on their menu online and in the store.
"Best burger I have had in my 23 years in Chicago, hands down. I have been twice in the last month, and my burger was awesome each time. I just got the basic burger with the split-top bun. The patty with the Chicago steak house seasoning was perfect, and the bun is top-notch. My only complaint is that the fries were too salty (and I love salt)."
"Amazing flavor to the burger, the pretzel bun is awesome, the seasonings are spectacular go here!!!! You must!!!!"
"Let me start by saying that I'm a vegetarian and this is one of my absolute favorite quick eats in Chicago. I live down the street so the convenience makes it a plus too. I can be quoted that anytime someone asks about a place to go that casual, ideally BYOB, close in Lincoln Park and good for a date- I always, always suggest B&B. I have brought first dates, boyfriends, sisters and best friends here and they never leave less than extremely happy with the meal. In the summertime the outdoor patio is perfect as it's nestled off the busy Armitage ave and provides shade on hot summer days.But the food. Since being a vegetarian in the meat-happy city of Chicago, I have considered myself a bit of a strict judge of veggie burgers. There are close seconds, but B&B veggie patty is by far the best I've ever, ever had. I typically go with the Umami spice blend, add goat cheese if I'm feeling frisky, but usually keep it simple with maybe some grilled onions or shrooms, lettuce, tomato and pickle. I've only gotten a bun once but otherwise go for the lettuce wrap so I can just more easily dig into the puppy. The patty is always perfectly charred - a rarity among veggie burgers. I always get the fries to split with  my dining mate and the people at B&B always note to tell me to get them vegan when they know I'm ordering a veg burger. I love this place. I'm headed there again this weekend for a girls birthday brunch- byob mimosas, egg sandwiches? Can't wait. I can always rely on a flavorful, hearty meal with fresh ingredients. Perfect for any occasion."
"I went to Butcher & The Burger last night around 8PM with three other people. This place has pretty limited seating, so go there at a non-prime eating time to get a table if you are dining with other people. They managed to eff up 3 out of 4 of our orders but, surprisingly, everyone in my group still really enjoyed their meals. I got the house blend beef (cooked medium) with the grandma's onion soup ""spice"" and mozzarella cheese on what was supposed to be pretzel bun but they gave me a split top bun instead. Super yummy. I will say that I didn't really taste the onion soup in the burger though, so that was a little disappointing. My boyfriend got the Sonoran Desert Chili in his burger, and it was the bomb. I also ordered a side of fries with truffle mayo...freakin' delicious. Also...this place is BYOB...thumbs up!"
"Awesome burgers and great fries.I had grass-fed beef w/ bacon, goat cheese, caramelized onions, truffle aioli, and the Chicago Steakhouse spice blend. It was superb. My boyfriend had the grass-fed bison and also loved it. The fries were great, but needed a heavy dose of salt. Will definitely return to try another combo as well as the frozen custard. Be warned that it is crowded and it takes a while to get your food, but it's BYOB, so bring some booze to pass the time. I didn't mind the waiting, but it was incredibly smokey inside the restaurant. I value delicious food over a nice comfortable space, hence the 4-star rating, but it's definitely something they should work on. I came home smelling like I'd been at a cookout all day. Could have done without the smell of smoke in my hair and on my coat. Otherwise, two thumbs up!"
"I came into this place hungry.  Hungry for something solid, satisfying and most importantly, tasty.This place has a mix of high-tech and grungy feel to it (the registers are ipads, I think...).  The burgers are high-tech in that they cost a lot.  This was most likely one of the most expensive burgers I've ever had.  However, it was a very delicious burger no matter what.  The ordering process equals in size and complexity (all the fixin's seem to be on a price scale) to the finished burger you receive.  Once you sit down and start eating however, all these little issues are moot, as you enjoy the savoriness of meal.I will be back to this place at some point or another - only reason not to is that I'm usually not wandering around this area to begin with."
I'm so torn on how to review this place...I live in the neighborhood and love having a quailty burger joint around the block. I want Butcher and Burger to survive and thrive.The vegan burger is amazing. I actually CRAVE it and I'm not a vegitarian. Get it on lettuce with umami and avocado with a side of wasabi mayo and you'll have a healthy and tasty meal.With that being said the prices are high- $10 for a veggie burger with no fries or sides seems a bit steep. Because I know the rents are high around here I can overlook a couple of extra bucks for this quality.The biggest draw back is the lack of ventilation. It is almost impossible to breathe in here. :( Please support this local spot but get your food to go or bring a gas mask.
"This place was absolutely delicious. There are so many different combinations you can make between the types of protein, the rubs (the best part) and the toppings you can keep coming back and trying something new.For people complaining about the price...it's on par with DMK, Kuma's and The Counter before it closed. Our order was 2 burgers with a couple of add-ons, one regular order of fries (big enough for 2) and 2 sodas and it was $30. Onto the food. I got a grass-fed burger, pretzel bun, steakhouse seasoning, lettuce and caramelized onions. GF got turkey burger, pretzel bun (they ran out of the split-top butter egg) lettuce, tomato, cheddar and steakhouse seasoning. Both were great and the fries were excellent.The only issues were that they ran out of the split-top butter egg bun...it's probably their most popular one and that means you shouldn't run out of it. The other issue and from reading the earlier reviews this sounds like a common theme is that they undercooked my burger. I asked for medium and definitely got medium-rare.There isn't a lot of seating but there's not much you can do about that. The girl taking our order was really nice and helpful. I definitely recommend this place. We will be back and I'll be looking to try a different burger combination."
"My boyfriend and I came here on a Friday evening and the food was GREAT!!!! I had the venison burger and he had I think, the all American burger, with fries and a side of beignets. delicious. I did not get the pickles on the burger, but the burger was excellent without them. My boyfriend LOVED his burger."
"I tried the craze... and I loved it.  We called ahead to see if there was a big crowd because I was worried about timing.   Luckily, they were busy, but not too busy!We arrived and walked into an Americana land.  The restaurant has a cute boutique feel but is ""manly"" too.  I like the mix of red wainscoting and marble tile.  Ordering is a pretty easy process... basically pick something from each category.I tried a very typical burger just to test the waters.  I had the prime beef with the Chicago spice seasoning mix.  I topped it with cheddar, tomato, lettuce, onion, and extra extra sweet pickles.  The pickles themselves were amazing!  My boyfriend had the elk and we split truffle mayo fries.  As if we weren't already full enough we had a beinet.  The cinnamon trumps the powdered sugar!Every burger bite was juicy and delicious.  I was stuffed when leaving.  I'd love to take out of town guests there and show off the neighborhood's finest!"
"I guess I havnt had their best. Heard all the hoopla, so I had 2 try it. Not impressed :-("
"Four of us came here on a Saturday night around 7.  The places has very limited seating so it was packed.  There are about 7-8 actual tables and then bar seating along the window for maybe 10-15 people.  It's definitely a tight squeeze and caused us a bit of anxiety because we were quickly at the front of the line to order food with no prospect of finding seats.  The idea of eating a massive, eight napkin, sauce dripping burger standing up in a corner somewhere while juggling a beer (the place is BYOB) was not appealing at all.  On top of not knowing where we were going to eat, deciding what to eat proved to be a nerve wracking experience as well.  There were so many combinations that can be created with the variety of meats, spices, buns, cheeses, and condiments.... the possibilities are endless.  Well, maybe not endless but there are so many that I was worried I might get too excited and stuff my burger with too much and fall flat.  Do I want wasabi mayo and bacon?  What cheese goes with that? Which meat do I want?  Will the umami spice work with that?  But I want blue cheese?  But blue cheese doesn't go with shrimp?  What do I do?!?!?!?Since I was a first timer here, I played it safe.  I ordered the ""cobb"" burger and just changed the  suggested turkey patty to a sirloin.  It was phenomenal.  It was ooey, gooey, meaty, cheesy, gobs of joy in my mouth.  It was like that moment when you see that special someone from across the room and your eyes meet and everything else seems to fade into the background and it is as though time slows down and the cheesy 80s soft rock ballad starts playing....  It was sort of like that.  Except it was the gooey fried egg, bacon, and blue cheese wonder slowly moving toward my mouth in beautiful slow motion as the ""Angel - Shaggy"" Pandora station played in the background (I'm serious it was ""Angel by Shaggy"" Pandora because I was loving the musics all night and my husband actually asked them....another reason they went above and beyond, an employee actually climbed up on a chair to check the phone and report back).  If I am so in love with the service and food, why only 4 stars?  The seating is the only downer.  We got really lucky, but the fact that it gave us as much anxiety as it did, four stars instead of five.  I will definitely be back!"
"While I  usually enjoy the food - of late, the service has been disappointing particularly in getting the order right.  When pointing out the mistake, they are argumentative and rather than correct the oder, they offer a bin-net - which is also delivered different than ordered."
"The burger here is good, unfortunately though, the hype that surrounds this place can and did somewhat damper my feelings about the food, as it was good, just not great. I got the all natural beef burger, done up simply with cheese, lettuce, and tomato, as I like to eat the burger and not the toppings and so I can get a real idea of the burgers flavor. All in all the burger was cooked just as I had specified, which is nice since I like my burger on the rare side, but after that I wasn't drooling over anything about the meal. Simply, the burger just didn't exude a ton of flavor. It was just basically a good but not great expensive burger, one in which I was sort of disappointed in. Honestly, if you are going to charge $13.00 for a burger, well, it better be damn good, and this burger just wasn't. All in all, I think had I payed around $7.00 I'd be extremely satisfied, but at the steep price they charge, meh, I just wasn't that impressed.Enjoy Suckas'!!!"
"Burger was a 2. Waited a solid hour and half to get my food, so that was pretty sweet."
"Yum!Went here on a whim last night with my husband and we left very happy.The burgers were delicious, the fries weren't too greasy but they were tasty and the service was really good.It was a Tuesday, so it wasn't overly crowded. We ordered our food and got a high top table very quickly. The woman who took our order was quite nice. The place felt clean and well kept. Our table was wiped as soon as we sat down.It's a no frills place that, appears to, just serve good food. I like the atmosphere, though I can see how it would be very frustrating to be there when it's crowded - not a ton of seating and the seating the is there is close together. Also, I can see how the line for ordering could get annoyingly long -- even last night, with few people dining in the restaurant (but lots of take-out orders), we waited ~5-10 minutes to place our order.We both stuck to the basic house cheeseburger. Neither of us had temperature complaints - it was seriously delicious!Honestly, it was good and the fact that my husband's picky burger habits were also satisfied was a sure sign that we'll be heading back again."
wow......have been here twice and both times were really good.  couldn't be a nicer group of people working there and as many choices as you can think of for a burger.  great size....large for sure but not stupid large or too big just enough to let you know you're eating a burger.  had the bison this time with bbq and bacon and bottom game seasoning.....it was excellent and really like the fries.  $32 for two specialty burgers and large fry (more than enough for two)......that's the same as shitty delivery.  I will take it everytime
I live close by so I've tried really hard to like this place.  Over the years I've probably gone 4 or 5 times.   I've tried a variety of combinations of burger/seasonings.  All overly salty.  WAY too expensive for the service and the taste.  Never cooked right.  Pretty much always cooked medium rare-ish even if you order medium well.  Many better choices out there.
"Very average.  I wouldn't go back.  $16 for a burger, fries and a coke, I want more for my buck.  The burger could have been bigger (not that that would have given it any more flavor), and I ordered it medium and it came out raw in the middle.  Fries were average at best.  Way to many other great burgers in this city that don't cost as much and taste a LOT better.  Nice concept and attempt, but overall, a big FAIL."
"We went there in early December right after it opened.  Interesting concept, makes going back a must in order to try the different selections.  However, our experience was simply ok.  They messed up our order, which was fine because I was willing to try anything they had.  Just a bit of a surprise considering that it was not busy.Would try it again now that they've probably worked out the kinks and are continuing to get tons of notoriety.Still love me some Kuma's though!"
"4.5It is certain: Chicago has an abundance of burger joints. As a steak capital of the world, it's no surprise that anything having to do with beef is going to be popular enough to merit many many (many!) restaurants. That said: just because there's a lot of something doesn't mean it's good. Enter, Butcher & The Burger. It does what it does really well and stands (way) out above the pack. How?1.) The name. It's just really cool. If it harkens back to some literary allusion, it beats me but I wouldn't be surprised. The name makes me feel like I should be discussing the loneliness of man as I devour a burger and suck down some suds. To stand out in the burger madness of Chicago, you should have a compelling name. It will pique interest and get people in the door;2.) The burger! I don't eat beef. Blame a collegiate experience with 'Grade D, Still Edible' (you lie, Snopes!) but I stopped eating the stuff and once you stop, you're done (unless you want some nasty stomach stuff happening). So, I eat turkey burgers and the turkey burgers here are fantastic. In fact, the entire ordering process is cool. You start with a patty of choice then you add spice. Yep, you read that correctly. You get to determine the spice quotient of your burger. How many places forget to even add salt & pepper to their patties? Here, you can add ghost pepper. I did not. I prefer my culo to not be en fuego. Grandma's Onion Soup is blend enough for me. Then, it's bun time. Get the split-top egg butter. Trust. Then -- and this might be the best part -- choose your toppings. Yeah, so what? Toppings. Here, the toppings are free! Well, not all of them. But the ones that make a burger a burger (cheese, tomato, GRILLED onions, pickles, condiments) are all free. There's no nickel and diming which seems to be an unfortunate trend in high-end burger places. Now, if you want foie gras or truffle oil aioli, you'll have to pay extra, but that should be expected. Add all of this together, and you have one, made-to-order, juicy, delicious burger. To stand out amongst the burger kings of Chicago, your burgers have to be delicious, accessible and custom. It's why you stopped in to a high-end burger joint;3.) The extras. Yes, the fries are hand-cut, nicely salted, piping hot and addictive. But, what if you're in the mood for German potato salad? Spinach salad? Walnuts & goat cheese? I love that B&tB doesn't stop at the expected. It gives you more than you would imagine. That's quality. And, it's not just the sides. Order a Sprecher root beer to with your food. Check-in on your Yelp app and enjoy a free beignet. Expect the unusual at B&tB -- and expect it to taste great. To rise above the standard in the burger game in Chicago, you need to up the ante and deliver something unique. Why be ordinary?; and4.) The decor. B&tB is small. Know this. Come early or late but if you come at peak hours, expect to wait and to go all 'Hunger Games' for a seat. You've been warned. Now, since I am an expert archer, I was cool. I picked off some North Shore ladies who lunch and snagged a high-boy near the door. From my perch, I could appreciate the ginormous menu board, the old-timey scale, the '50s lunch counter on the opposite wall, spice wall, mirror case, exposed brick, etc. The place is brimming with character and it's an inviting place to rest for a spell and eat some quality, locally-sourced food. To stand out in the burger field in Chicago... you have to stand out and that's exactly what B&tB does."
"Nice local option. Great burgers with lots of options. Fries are delicious. Beware, though, they fry in lard by default. If you are veg/hallal/kosher you can ask for the fries to be cooked in vegetable oil. The staff were friendly and the atmosphere was great."
"Just went here for dinner.  I had their burger on the egg bun with caramelized onions and blue cheese.  My husband and I also shared a small order of fries.  The burger was pretty good but needed a tad more blue cheese.  The fries were delicious, the best I have ever had in my life.  Perfect, no criticisms."
"I went here to eat because the reviews were excellent, and frankly, I'm a sucker for burgers on  pretzel buns. The burgers aren't cheap, but they are tasty. The freshness of the beef was immediately noticeable, and there are countless options for toppings, seasonings, etc. I even stuck around to get some custard, and it was very smooth and delicious, as custard should be. I liked the decor, and the staff was friendly. The seating was a bit cramped, but it wasn't busy. All in all, this is a good place to grab a good burger!"
"Great progress here. I just returned with a friend and we thoroughly enjoyed B&tB.I totally dig HOT HOT HOT food, so I ordered the Ghost Pepper burger. They really hit this one. Raw Ghost Peppers, while insanely HOT, do not really taste good.  B&tB found a way to make it all work.I'm happy to say they've figured out the ordering process, which had been tedious since customers have so many options to choose from.  B&tB has now deployed iPad-bearing hosts to take orders from those who are next in line.  Very smart.Be sure to ask the staff about the furnishings....The stools along the west wall came from a very ""special"" place in Pennsylvania.  Look high toward the north wall to see an ""official"" Chicago airport timepiece.Very much a favorite."
"My favorite burger spot in Chicago!!!(And I'm really picky when it comes to meat.)You must have the pretzel bun. It makes an already great burger phenomenal. Some people might think it's semi-pricey for burgers, but this is not just any burger place. You can do dinner for two (share the fries...order truffle mayo on the side) - and you'll average around $26.It's BYOB, which is a plus. And they have beignets & coffee from Cafe Du Monde. If you go with a curious/open mind, you'll find a lot of lovely touches that make this place a personal go-to.(I can't believe it's taking me so long to put up my yelp review.)"
"You want a burger?  This is a pretty good option for a well seasoned, juicy burger!  They have quite a few options for types of burger as well as toppings - not so many that they don't put loving care into preparation of each topping ingredient. The beignets are pretty good as well - tons of powdered sugar!!!Staff is super friendly."
"Everything looked so very very promising.This place is a disappointment of the highest possible order.Absolutely unnecessarily silly ordering complications.2 burgers, 1 fry, 1 pickle, 1 drink = $33+The dill pickle looked like a winner, but it sucked bad. Like a rotten mush green sausage with very confusing pickling elements. Mushy dill vinegar, crappy cheap processed garlic, and something sweet tossed in. Embarrassing at best, and I get to throw half of it away.My partner ordered a kiddie size burger - they ignored that, and made it a regular size.My partner's burger arrives - a very simple and normal combination.My burger arrives 7 minutes later - All but the bun is identical to my partner's order. That bun took an extra 7 minutes, right?The burger texture is simply horrible. We ordered grass-fed beef, with simple salt n pepper 'flavoring'. They must have massaged the shit out of these patties as they were tougher than the rubbery shoe-soul fake-steak at a Ponderosa/Shoneys/OldCountryBuffet. S - A - D.Not to mention how poorly cooked it was - unbelievable. It had no sear, and was covered in soot... covered I tell you, in a burnt fat/grease smoke taste - not meat..The fries.. $5 for fries. I was searching and searching to figure out how these fries, at a burger place, not downtown, are $5. Less than mediocre twice fried fries. I felt like Travolta in PulpFiction about the $5 shake. If you have the balls to charge $33 for all this, you better be ready to back this up.But alas, failure.And a big failure at that.This place isn't even mediocre.It is just seriously way over priced to make up for what they overspent in fancy knickknacks and do-dads making up the distance completely missed by what the core product should have been. They somehow think the design and decor and fake butcher crap all over the place will distract you from the complete and utter fleecing you will undergo whilst trying to choke down their 'product'It quite pisses me off that this place can even put 'burger' or even 'butcher' in their name, as there was a severe absence of both.I think I read somewhere in a TimeOut Chicago type article that this place is supposed to be owned/setup by some proper professional restaurant people 'who know' what they are doing. Well, they missed it in the food department... which should be the only departmentIf you like to hang out in Lincoln Park and get LincolnPark-gouged for poorly made food heralded as good - this is your place... It's like one of those movies you go to, and then wish you had that time back.Should have just gotten pissed off waiting 45 minutes at Kuma's - I would have at least had a decent burger, properly cooked, and realistically priced.Ohh- one last thing. A stained wooden plank with your logo fake-burned into it for my 'plate', awesome... ohh and you want ME to bus my own table- for a $33 burger meal?"
"Best burger I've had in months. I really liked their flavor options and different kind of french fries, too. Everyone there was really friendly, to boot. I totally recommend this place if you want something nice but casual and decently priced. Check out the outdoor seating."
"We have heard some great things about this place and have been very excited to go try it out!  So what did we do?  Gather up 20 of our friends to go check it out!  Sure it's a small place, but there's plenty of room for us to share with everyone!   We decided to head into the city early to make sure that we could all get there before the dinner rush.  I had the House Blend Beef with the Chicago Steakhouse seasoning on a Pretzel bun with Goat Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato, Grilled Onions and Mushrooms.  I must honestly say that this burger has to be in my top 5 burgers I've ever had!  They say that the House Blend Beef with the Chicago Steakhouse seasoning is their most popular and I can see why!  The flavor of the meat and the seasoning blend were amazing together!  The boy had the House Blend Beef Simple (sea salt and cracked black pepper) on a Pretzel bun with Cheddar Cheese, Smoked Bacon and Grilled Onions.  The Smoked Bacon was great!  If you're a bacon lover, you have to try this!  The smell alone will have your jowls watering in anticipation of the smoky flavor!With everyone that was there we had many different burgers and salads sampled and absolutely loved!  I couldn't begin to list them all, so I'll let them tell their own tails!  The staff was quick and friendly!  Especially Erin... She was an absolute delight to work with!  She was able to manage everyone in our crazed party, assist the other guests that were in and out while we were there, and keep the rest of the staff on their game without skipping a beat!  She made our visit even better!Though I had leftovers and I was stuffed to the gills Erin had made a Peanut Butter and Banana Custard a few days ago... Now, if you know me, you'll know I don't like chocolate... My favorite ""dessert"" is peanut butter and bananas... I was more than please to have dessert no matter how full I was once I heard she had this amazing treat on hand!  OMG I was not disappointed!  If you've been thinking about checking this place out, stop thinking about it and just go there already!  You will not be disappointed!!"
"milkshake review: they make a damn good shake! I had already eaten lunch or else I'd indulged in both a burger AND a shake, but I'll save that for next time. If you're strolling through Lincoln Park and in need of a sweet treat you can walk around with, this is definitely it! I wish they hadn't been out of the cinnamon option, but the classic chocolate was just fine. Thick, spoon-worthy shakes have their time and place, but I really like that these are thinner and more slurpable, thus walking friendly. Have you ever tried walking and spooning on uneven sidwalks? That ish is hard."
"Awesome place - the burgers are kinda ""make it the way you want"" burgers. you choose all the ingredients that you want. plenty of option to experiment from.  they have the homemade chips which were just outstanding. and to end with the Beignets  ---NICEEEE :)"
"Loved the fries. Burger is great well done. After attempting my own combo (the cajun spice doesn't stand out as much as I wished), I will try one of their own combinations next time. There are nice pull-out seats to sit to wait for take-out. Small restaurant; not enough seats if you have a large party."
"I came in here the other day after I had been told that the burgers here were good. I tried one of their beef burgers with the steakhouse seasoning, cheddar cheese, truffle mayo, and a fried egg. Oh my God was it good! I stuffed my self silly! The french fries were tasty, and the beignets were yummy as well. I had ordered 5 beignets because I'd been told they were small, but what i got was certainly NOT small! They even threw in an extra one for free because supposedly again they were small lol. The only downside is that this place doesn't have much seating which can be a problem since it's pretty busy, and that the prices aren't exactly cheap. Overall though I felt the food was worth the price and I'd definitely come here again!"
"I would say that this place has above average burgers. I am not sure it deserves the title ""best burger in Chicago"", and the prices are higher for just a burger. I went early on a Sunday afternoon so the wait was not bad but I could see how the line could get long. After your order is in the turnaround is pretty quick. Thought the fries were good, and would recommend a pretzel bun."
"Move over BK, I'm having it my way at Butcher & The Burger now.  This place is serious when it comes to customizing your burgers.  And when I say serious I'm talking type A-control freak-how I want it-when I want it serious.  One could get lost in all the options but I kept it simple and struck hamburger gold.  House blend beef + S&P + split top egg bun + cheddar + griddled onions + Benton's bacon = darn near burger perfection.  Juicy beefy smoky salty sweet deliciousness in every bite.  What more could you ask for?  This would've been a 4-star review seeing how they overcooked my burger the first time around, but they nailed it on my return trip and all is forgiven.  If you're a french fry lover then the Kennebec fries are a must, along with a side of black truffle aioli for dipping.  As the name implies, there's a little butchery going on here, too.  Next to the register you'll find a small case with a rotating selection of fresh meats, and butchery classes are offered regularly as well.  And lastly, no trip here is complete without a taste of their homemade frozen custard.  Flavors rotate daily and you also save $1 with your yelp check-in!"
"This place is simply awesome!!!! The way they serve the food for dine in on the wooden butcher blocks is very creative. Good food, BYOB."
"I have been here 2 times. First time was amazing! Second time was just okay. So First visit: I ordered the prime beef burger with the chicago seasoning, cheddar cheese, smoked bacon (amazing), fried egg (can't go wrong with that), lettuce, tomatoes, onion on a egg bun. My burger was perfectly med-rare. Juicy, flavorful, heaven in your mouth. Fries with truffle mayo = WIN. That truly was the tastiest burger I have had. We had to wait in line for awhile, but it was worth it. I have one complaint, there is a girl who is quite honestly, really bitchy. She kept yelling at a bus boy. She was yelling LOUD and I think that looks awful in front of customers. Second visit: I ordered the prime beef burger with g-ma's onion soup seasoning, egg, bacon, american cheese, tomato, lettuce, onion, pretzel bun. Asked for it medium rare and it came out well done. Extremely sad. My brothers burger came out well done too. Double sad. I just decided that the cook was having an off day, or they had someone new on the line. My first time was so amazing, that it trumps the second. I guess my third visit will be the deciding factor for this burger joint. Oh, I also would like comment that the same yelling girl the first visit was again yelling and having a fit the second visit. She needs to control herself or take anger management. I would have fired her a long time ago for making noticeable scenes in front of customers. That is not okay in my book."
"I am really disappointed to say that I didn't think this place was that great.  Seemed expensive and I wasn't blown away like I thought I would be.  The meat was tasty, but it was a little overcooked for medium and I didn't leave thinking, OMG that was amazing.  The pickles were great!  Overall, I would go elsewhere for a great burger in Chicago."
"Hmmm.I'll have to be back for an actual burger (and some fries...those looked like potatosex), but the custard was kind of subpar. This is a cute shop right on Armitage, right next to all the $$$$$ clothing shops. The ordering process is such: You stand in a line, place your order, and await your pile of meat at a table. Anyway. I wanted a custard to go. I got the raspberry flavor, and I was very excited because frozen custard is probably one of my favorite foods. The custard? Meh. I mean, if you mix cream and sugar together you can't create something that's awful. That said, this custard was grainy, and there were parts of it that were actually mint/chocolate chip custard. Trust me, mint chocolate chip doesn't go with raspberry. The custard also wasn't super creamy like I'm used to. It was kind of disappointing. I would go back to try a burger, but I'll stick with Lickity Split for custard.Pro tip: This place has ""lettuce"" buns for all you low carbers."
"This place serves a mean burger. It's just a tiny bit overwhelming when you look at the menu and you realize that the possibilities are literally endless. I tend to get a little bit ""deer in headlights"", but luckily the person taking your order will go through category by category so you don't have to spit out your order in one long seemingly stream of conscious sentence.Recommend: umami flavor, caramelized onions, truffle mayo, butter (or whatever it's called) bun. The fries are a little salty for my taste, and can be a little iffy. As in, some are soggy, some are crispy. Meh.All-in-all, SOLID burger."
Burgers are for real.
"Like many other reviewers, I want to give this place 5 stars but B&B always leaves something to be desired.  It's a fun experience to build your own burger and pick spices, but none of the rubs seem to infuse enough flavor to really make a difference.I've probably been there 5+ times out of convenience, but the last 2 times my burger hasn't been cooked to the right temperature or it comes out on the wrong bun.  The staff and owner are happy to rectify the situation, but for a $10 burger in a small shop, you expect it to come out the way your order it. The burgers are good and the fries are great, but it seems like some details get overlooked."
"This place is SO worth the hype. Custom made burgers and perfectly made fries. As a Wisconsin native, I really appreciated all the different types of cheese options. I had the grass-fed beef on a split top bun with horseradish havarti cheese. Yum! I was a little overwhelmed by the menu at first, but the waitress did a good job of explaining the different seasonings and best pairings.I like the neighborhood feel of this place and they played really good music. We'll definitely be coming back for more!"
"Good burger but expensive. Got the beef with Bentons bacon, cheddar, and supposedly dill pickles. Unfortunately they gave me sweet pickles so I had to remove them, but the rest was great. Very nice char to the burger and the bun was one of the better buns I've ever had. The fries were ok, but nothing special..."
"I finally tried a burger here last night. I went with a popular choice and ordered the house bland with Chicago style rub on a pretzel bun. The burger was good, but nothing to write home about. The fries were good too, especially the truffle mayo I got with it. I didn't take advantage of BYOB, but that is always a plus. My girlfriend ordered the beet salad and she said it was good as well. The staff was kinda off. It wasn't that crowded and everyone there seemed frantic and overwhelmed which was kind of annoying. I would definitely come back here if someone I knew wanted to go, but I have no future plans to come back on my own."
"I just moved to the neighborhood and Butcher & the Burger is less than a 5 minute walk from place. It looked like a good place and it was. I had the grass fed beef burger with Cajun spices, Swiss cheese, on a pretzel roll, with fries. It was good the burger was cooked to medium rare perfection, but I wish the Cajun spice was spicer. The fries were good although the Dijon mustard I dipped them in was way too vinegary. The price for all this was $13.50, not too bad for grass fed beef, but I wouldn't come back too much because of the price."
"It's doesn't happen very often when you find a food establishment that will go beyond what they have to do to make sure you enjoy your meal. I have a lot respect for this business and it's owner. Yes, the first time I went here it was not the greatest burger but sometimes places deserve a second chance. Butcher & The Burger deserved one and proved that it was not an average burger joint. The meat was juicy and flavorful this time, and I did get some heat from the ghost pepper blend. I will admit it still isn't burger meets sun spicy but the flavor is delicious which makes up for it. One thing that I did leave out last time is that the service is incredible here. Everyone is very nice, and even the chef who made my burger delivered it personally and was asking if I needed anything. Little thing like that go a long way. All in all, check out Butcher & The Burger it is not your average burger hotspot."
"I'll add my $0.02Burgers are really good but $12 for a salmon burger is too high.  Fries aren't good at all - just starch, no flavor, and half the basket was cold.  I'm digging Burger Philosophy and Huey's in A-ville for fries.The main thing is, about 6 people ordered all around us.  It's like they shuffled the tickets as to whose order they made first, in fact, the people sitting there when we showed up finally got served when we were about to leave.  It seems like everyone's high that works there, or something."
"The hubs and I decided to stop in here on a whim after an appointment at a salon down the street. I had the lentil brown rice burger with grandma's onion soup spice and cheddar on a pretzel roll and a Mexican Coke. I feel like veggie burgers are hit or miss, and this one was definitely a hit. Very tasty and filling. My hubs had a house blend beef burger with Chicago steakhouse spices on a whole wheat bun, and he said his was yummy too. I'd like to come back and order one of their more exotic burgers (like shrimp or bison) and give their shakes a try."
"My husband and I came here with some friends while we were on a bit of a burger kick. Our group ordered a variety of different burgers along with custard and sat outside on a beautiful summer night. I had the All-American Burger (I think it was called) which pretty much took the difficulty out of me picking my bread and patty and all that (because it's a build-your-own-burger place and I'm not so great at that). The one thing I did add on was wasabi mayo. Altogether, I thought my burger was delicious. It was flavorful and fresh and just so scrumptious to eat. Everyone else was pretty happy with their burgers as well. It was a specialty burger with a specialty price, but I would definitely come back if I was in the mood to splurge on a good burger. The custard, on the other hand, is something I would not come back for. I'm not sure if it had something to do with the heat of the day and the constant opening and closing of the freezer, but the custard was pretty much a milkshake by the time it got to me (and not a very good one at that). I've had some of the best and creamiest custard straight from Wisconsin, so this was a big disappointment-- a nearly $5 disappointment. Save the money you'd spend on custard and put it toward a burger instead."
"Went back and had the Chicago Steakhouse spice on the house mix, with Pickles and Mayo.  Unbelievable.  They added free water jugs as well!  That's a relief to they guy who forgot to bring his own beer.Fries are excellent...Look out.Go there now."
"Burger was delicious. Choose your meat, seasoning, bun, and toppings. I had grass fed with french onion soup seasoning on a pretzel roll topped with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, onion, and wasabi mayo. Very good. Burger had a terrific flavor and was very juicy.The fries were thick cut and kinda perfect. Crunchy outside with a nice potato-y inside. They are thick and they are very potato. There wasn't any seasoning beyond salt, but that was what I wanted.If dining in, be warned that seating is very limited and mildly awkward. My biggest complaint was the volume of the music in the place. LOUD then quiet then LOUDER then quiet. It seemed like they were turning it up when a song they *really* liked came on.The guy behind the counter was very nice and helpful and we didn't have to wait too long for our food after ordering. I love that they bring it out to you on a little cutting board.It is a bit out of the way from my Lincoln Square home, but I'll definitely be making another stop next time I have to go down to that area. I need to try the beignets next time!"
"I'm usually not a huge burger person, but this place was amazing. Definitely the best burger I've had here. Had their house prime blend with Cajun and fries. Courteous, friendly staff. Was busy at 2:30pm on a Saturday, but food came out quickly.  Love love love!"
"I love a good burger and this place is indeed one of those that can satisfy, BUT, sadly, it's not all it's cracked up to be.  The BYOB is nice, but you can't drink outside and the inside is very small. Not good for large groups.We went on a weekend day in the middle of the afternoon.  It wasn't too terribly busy, but there still were a few problems with service and our food orders.Each of us ordered something different so we could try a variety of flavors.  We liked that you can order several different kinds of meat for your burger like turkey, grass feed beef, pork, salmon, elk or bison.The first problem came when they ran out of something, but didn't tell us until the rest of the order was already out except for the fries.  They forgot those all together.Then the service, or lack of.  Everyone at the place was extremely nice, but they didn't really come around and check on you or bring things out like condiments and utensils.The wait on the food was a little longer than usual for a burger place too.  Especially for not really being busy.The burgers themselves were juicy.  Not too terribly flavorful though.  We all tried different seasonings, but couldn't taste them.  The size was OK, but not a great portion, especially for the cost.  One had added bacon, but the amount of actually bacon was pretty weak.  Mostly crumbs.  Def not worth the $2 more.   Oh, and the pickles were kinda gross.  Not crunchy, kosher dills, but some kind of watery, sweet disks.The fries, when they did finally come out were really good.  Everyone loved those.They have really good fresh brew ice tea and natural sugar and syrup to compliment it.  Plus large jugs of ice water with lemon too.For desert we tried the custard and beignet.  They were both pretty good, but again, pricy for what you get.There is not much room in this place.  Hardly any seating inside.  Outside was nice, but you sit on a slant and food and drinks tend to roll off the table.  And it's on the sun side of the building, so it gets very warm, and the garbage is right next to the seating area.  It's kind of a dirty run down looking place, even though it's not very old.  So don't go expecting much.Overall, the idea of the joint is good.  The food is tasty.  The location is OK.  But with so many other high end / specialty burger joints around, not on my top 10 list.  The butcher idea is nice, but again, very pricy.  $10 a pound for bacon.  $30 steaks."
"Love love love love love! a bit pricey, but  custom seasoned delicious meat, Byob. burger heaven! only con, outdoor seating no alcohol :-( ....but the biegnets made up for that! Not to mention the amazing and helpful staff! will return again and again and again. Please don't be discouraged by the price if you want cheap meat the. Go to mcdonalds you get what you pay for!"
Good food....but Jon Tafer would absolutely annihilate this place. They have the operational efficiency of your local DMV. I heard the head cook yell damn more than I saw burgers coming out from the grill.
"As a vegetarian going to a burger place, I honestly am surprised to be giving it 4 stars...but it's we'll deserved! The lentil burger they have is pretty darn good, despite it not wanting to stay in one piece for very long.  The staff was great at helping me pick out the right seasonings and toppings to add...I tend to go a bit overboard when given the option, so I'm really glad I had good advice  from them! Also, they advertise that their fries are cooked in animal fat but they will make special order fries for you if requested...that saved me a seriously painful stomach ache later in the night!! If you eat fish, they also serve a shrimp burger and a salmon burger I believe, but the lentil burger is so good that I've never made it to those options! The umami sauce (ginger soy) is great with the lentil burger with the wasabi mayo. I'd recommend either skipping the fries or splitting them with someone because the burger is SUPER filling by itself. The fries are awesome, but definitely too much for one person to eat.  They also have a mean chocolate shake made with their (homemade?) frozen custard."
"They've got a stylish setup here that mixes old antiques with modern furnishings.  It's as if it were specifically designed to get profiled in glossy magazine features on the evolution of the burger.  The restaurant is informal with an ordering counter at front, and a small dining room and patio area that's available for you after you place your order.I like how they have their order-counter menu organized in clear-cut assembly line style.  You choose: (1) type of meat; (2) type of seasoning; (3) bun style; (4) traditional toppings like lettuce and tomato; and (4) unusual extras like egg, foie gras, smoked bacon, avocado.  I got the pork burger with cajun seasoning on a pretzel bun and that turned out real nice together.  I also got a whole bunch of extra stuff on it, like the aforementioned fried egg and avocado.  I got too pumped about all these extras and I ended up eating my Jenga-tower of a burger with a fork.  We also shared a large order of their fries, which were typical, unextraordinary fries  but still tasted good and were more than enough (leftovers for home) to split between two people.  Finally, we split a shake, and like the fries, it was good but not unusually good.  Our only gripe about the place was that my girlfriend ordered a bison burger done medium and it came out bleedingly rare.  She ended up not eating any more than her first, one bite, and to my regret the next day, found out she gave the leftovers to the dog at home.  My suggestion is that you specify in clear terms to the cook whether you want the meat rare or not."
"I take it all back. The fries kick ass. Check out my full, updated review of this bomb burger joint. wp.me/p3qig4-1x"
Delicious burger. Tons of options to customize your own burger and can we talk about the truffle mayo?!
The Butcher and The Burger is amazing. If you haven't been there go now. From the start we were greeted by the owner who ran down the menu and made some recommendations since it was our first time. The burger was cooked very well and the house blend with simple seasoning was a great choice for a first timer. The Kennebec fries were probably the best fries I've ever had. Cooked perfectly and seasoned well. The truffle mayo goes great with these as well!The caprese and the beignets were very tasty and brought together the whole meal. I must say I went on a whim and will definitely be here much more often. GO HERE NAO!
"If a Man Burger and a Sexy Woman Burger met and were like,MB: Hey dollface.WB: Hey handsome!MB: What do you say we mix my spicy-spiciness with your sexy goodness, sit on that fire over there and get saucy on a pretzel roll...NO MAYO.WB: You're already hot with your seven+ options for seasoned blends and bonus features, you charmer, you!  Put some fries on that little blue plate special and we're talking.  Just me and you though, I don't do group stuff, it gets way crowded and I don't get any space or attention.MB: I feel you.  Just us, a Mexican Coke...TWO STRAWS.WB: Stop it...:)MB: Let's get out of this line, steal this BYOB-overstayed-6-person booth and start this Burger Badonkadonk, cuz I'm hungry, you B.I.L.F., you.WB: Butcher me, baby...don't forget the straw, cuz I'm THIRSTY.Me and my wife love this place.Me and my best friend love this place.  His non-bovine eating wife loves this place.I took my training partner here.  He loved it."
"Today I called ahead to carry out, and when I got there at the time I was told, I had to wait nearly 30 minutes before I could pay. The food was ready and packaged up with my name on it right when I got there, but I literally stared at my own carry-out package for a half an hour before they got around to letting me pay for it.I understand that it was busy, but it is extremely frustrating to be waiting that long when I specifically ordered carry out so that I would not have to wait, not to mention that my food got soggy and cold while I waited. By the time I got home it was literally sopping wet and not even luke warm, plain old cold. The fact that I spent twenty dollars on this disgusting soggy cold burger and fries is absolutely ridiculous. Go and eat in the restaurant and you'll have a great meal, but absolutely avoid ordering take out if you want to enjoy your twenty dollar burger. What a waste."
"As I write this review I'm keeping in mind that this is a new business and coming from a small business myself I understand it takes some time to work out all of the kinks. I'm giving this burger joint 2 stars in hopes that In time I'll be able to come back and adjust it to 5 after this Butcher gets his ducks in a row. The place is small, with a nice patio - considering theres a heat wave right now it was a bummer that they don't have AC and have a poor ventilation system. As much as I love the ""build your own burger"" idea they need to have a better way to select from their wide variety of choices (which are great!).They should take note from a place like The Counter who have a very easy checklist to build your burger- cuts time in half which is especially important in Butchers case because theres only one cashier/register to order from. Like I said before this place has a great selection to build your burgers (and great fries) but definetly need to work out a few major kinks before I start recommending this place to friends. There is definetly potential!"
"I was totally underwhelmed (and slightly grossed out) by this place... which bums me out because I was really excited to try it.  My boyfriend and I went here for dinner - the girl who took our order could not have been less interested or polite.  She gave me a cup of ice for water but didn't bother to ask my boyfriend if he wanted one.  Our food came out pretty quickly.  My burger looked... weird.  This might just be the difference between ""regular"" (??) beef and grass-fed, but it really didn't look appetizing at all.  The fries were lukewarm, barely seasoned and boring.  I can tell you one thing - when I'm walking to the el from my barre class at Barre Bee Fit, I won't be craving this anymore.  Maybe one day I'll come back for beignets, but I definitely won't be back for a burger."
"Disclaimer: I don't even LIKE hamburgers. Their charred exterior and juicy interior is entirely lost on me.However - this place had been very highly recommended by a friend. So me and the BF, who came happily and willingly, walked over and were met by the most heavenly of smells. Grilled meat (which interestingly enough, even my vegetarian friends say smells good). There was a line, which is not unusual.This place reminds me of a Chipotle for burgers. You choose your bun, meat, seasonings, and toppings, and they assemble it all for you. Its BYOB and they have a cute little patio outside as well.I have decision-making issues, so I chose the Cobb burger, which was a turkey burger with a fried egg, blue cheese, avocado and bacon. It was amazingly delicious and by FAR the best turkey burger I have had in my life. The BF had the bison burger, which was also good, but I think we both liked mine better. C'est la vie BF, you just don't have the superior choosing skills that I do. (really it was the fried egg that sold me).A little pricey, but I felt the quality was high. Just go here expecting prices of a sit-down restaurant (around $30 for 2 burgers and fries) and you won't be disappointed. Just because its burgers doesn't mean its fast food, my friends.PS - they also have MILKSHAKES (!!)"
Bison burger ...nuff said!
"In keeping with past practice, I'll reserve the elusive 5 star rating for a second opinion; anyone can get it right once, after all. But the fact that 5 stars is even in the conversation means this place has something special going on.The space is a rather unassuming storefront amid the boutiques of West Armitage. There are a handful of tables inside, a few more outside, and a cool farmhouse interior. You order at the counter from your choice of meats, spices, buns, cheeses, and an impressive array of yummy toppings (think bacon, avocado, a fried egg, even foie gras!). Sip some BYOB wine or beer (and don't skimp--these burgers absolutely stand up to a nice red) and wait for your mad scientist creation to appear.Since, after all, almost anything would taste good smothered in cheese and topped with bacon & foie gras, I decided to test Butcher's Burger on how well it could execute the most basic concept: grass-fed beef with the Chicago steakhouse spice blend on a pretzel roll with the usual burger toppings. And boy did it deliver. Juicy, delicious, perfectly cooked. One of my companions had the turkey burger and it too was fantastic...for a turkey burger anyway. We also shared some awesomely tasty fries (hard to resist going all out when you're eating a burger this good-) and a very yummy potato salad.If B&B isn't yet in the conversation for best burger in Chicago, it needs to be."
"Where's the butcher? I mean, I got the burger part. But where's the guy with the meat cleaver hacking away? Brutal picture, yes, but when a place is called Butcher & the Burger, you know that's what comes up.I'm not trying to take anything away from the fine folks at B&tB. They sling some mean meat. The menu was intimidating, and if I'm being honest, I was a little overwhelmed. Pick your meat, SEASONING (legit), cheese, bread, toppings, extra toppings (FOIE GRAS.....costs more than your average burger, fyi), and a crap ton more. I literally took about seven minutes to place an order...on their fancy-panty iPads.Wound up spending like low-teen dollars, with fries and all. Burger was tasty and fries were awesome. I'd say make multiple trips to try different seasonings and combinations.BUT WAIT!! THERE'S MORE!Seriously, wake up early and get your butt in for breakfast. Their breakfast sandwiches are fiyahhhhhhhhhhhh. Had to opportunity to try three different sammies and they were among the best breakfast sandwiches I've had in quite some time.And while you're at it, order a few beignets. They're so delish.The space isn't huge, so be wary of the time you're planning on going...and be mindful of the number of diners you're with on your adventure. It can get smokey, as the kitchen is open. Don't be surprised if you walk out with a new cologne or perfume!"
"Horrible experience!After leaving red robin disappointed that my valid DL was not accepted in order to get a drink bc it was vertical instead of horizontal, me and my bf craving burgers decided to try this joint out. Boy, were we surprised. First off, Google reviews had this place labelled as one $ out of four, indicating that the prices are low. Mind you, we paid over $30 for two baseball sized burgers, no fries. It wouldnt have been so bad if they had at least tasted good. My bf ordered an All American burger, medium well and I ordered the shrimp surf burger. It took almost 15 minutes for these burgers to be done, yet the meat on my bfs burger was way too red to be classified as medium well. He also found a string of some sort inside that he was able to pull out. My burger tasted nothing like shrimp. There was so much wasabi on it, it's a surprise they hadnt just called it a Wasabi on a bun burger. The staff were more concerned with what kind of music was playing, than how quickly (or in this case, slowly) they can cook a burger.This place seems like it satisfies uptight city people who don't mind paying an arm and leg for a tasteless burger the size of a White Castle slider."
The fries are absolutely amazing! Burgers are great as well!
Great Burgers! Food portions are huge!!
"Made a second visit here mid-May after a first try the week they opened.  On  my original visit I posted ""Fries are very good. At $15 for a cheeseburger, fries and drink it should have blown me away. The house blend ground beef was OK. Not flat-out delicious like Flub-a-Dub Chub's.""After the second try I gotta stick with the first review.  I know they use only the ""best"" ingredients.  But so does Smith and Wollensky - and their burger [for the same price by the way] is out of this world.  Anyway, I think I gave them a fair try."
"Probably the best burger in Chicago.  I went grass fed (best for environment/ makes doctors job easier and it is better for the cows), medium cook, split top bun, steakhouse seasoning, bacon, Swiss,  tomato, raw onion and lettuce, bbq sauce.  It's better than DMK, they give you more meat, the grass fed was a little fatter than a typical grass fed which is good in my book.  It is a special skill by the farmer if it is 100% grass fed, usually they graze and can be very lean.  Medium is a maximum cook, as dragging your fries through the grease that comes out of the burger on the cutting board is quite the dessert."
"The best burgers in the city. Fully customizable with a variety of spices and toppings, along with excellent and varied meats (bison, grass-fed beef, seasonal game, etc.) And delicious salads, fries, and custard to supplement with. This is where I go when I'm feeling too lazy to make a burger at home."
"This place was okay but the group of small children sliding around and banging on the banquette seats was almost as annoying as the oblivious parents who were letting their kids invade our space. Also, as a short person, it was mounting a horse to get up to their booths. And there's not really a back, so expect anything you put behind you to roll off the back, like jackets and purses. Hang on to those! The food was great, but the place had the feel of a homey restaurant, but the service style of a potbellys. So it was weird, you 'kinda' had a server who did some things for you, like take your order and get you water, but then you had to do other things yourself, like get certain kinds of drinks that were at the drink stand (i.e. ice tea) but other stuff was brought to the table, like pop. So that was inconsistent. The tables are really close together, so if you're anything other than slim, it's difficult to get to and from the counter, drink stand, etc. especially if you're sitting on the booth side.I'd go there again for maybe take out, but it's not a chill hangout and it's loud. And the napkin dispenser asks you very, very politely to eat and leave. Please and thank you."
"Butcher in the burger is a phenomenal burger spot , they elk burger with the backwoods rub fit together perfectly( recommended by employee). I love the build it urself concept. The one critique was the temp my burger was cooked too. I asked for a medium rare and I get basically well. I understand the meat is lean and everything which I went midrare rather than med. the fries were good but mine were a lil soggy. With those two minor critiques, I say this place definitely made it onto my rotation. I'll give it a go next time earlier in the day bc I went at 940pm just before closing. They get the benefit of the doubt."
"I'm very sad, very sad indeed.  I'm sad that I waited this long to try Butcher & the Burger.  It's been bookmarked since it opened but the stars didn't aline until recently.  Wanting to try a new place neither of us had been to, my friend and I settled on B &t B.  We chose correctly.  First of all the place is super cute, right on the corner.  When we walked in there was one person ordering before us.  I took a look at the daunting menu and tried to make some decisions.  I knew I wanted a pretzel bun (because everything is better on one) and a beef patty.  Added on the Steakhouse seasoning, griddled onions and mushrooms, pickles, lettuce, tomato and swiss.  Told them my burger temperature and added an order of fries to share.Stuck with water on this visit buy they are BYOB (and you can even get a discount at the store down the street - see sign in window).When our burgers arrived a very short wait later, they were presented on branded wooden cutting boards and boy were they delicious.  The overall attention to detail here just adds that extra squeeze of the cheek, that extra oomph.  Case in point- the logo detailed on the back of the high top chairs.  I love a good burger and I love exciting toppings (B & t B has plenty more options that I will be back to try, including an onion soup spice mix) but most of all I enjoy quality meat that is cooked to the temperature I request.  Yeah you can put a load of high brow topping on any patty (looking at you DMK) but I'd rather have them on a thicker patty cooked medium rare.So if you like burgers, BYOB places, are in the neighborhood, are hungry.... you know what just go and be happy!"
"I was starving when I came here for the first time, and I decided to get my typical favorite burger ingredients (and a couple extra), rather than try anything crazy, so I could truly judge their burger compared to other places. Here's what I ordered:Natural and Local House Blend Beef cooked medium rareChicago Steakhouse SeasoningTruffle MayoSmoked BaconGriddled MushroomsFried EggPretzel BunWhen it first came out, I immediately noticed they gave me a split top egg bun instead, but I was too hungry to go request a different one. I bit in, and OMG, it was the best burger I've had thus far in my life. Granted, I haven't had Kuma's yet, but this one was cooked perfectly to medium rare, it was super juicy, and all the ingredients complemented each other. After my friend tried it, he thought they may have used the ghost pepper seasoning instead of steakhouse cause he got a spicy bite, and I normally don't do well with really spicy anything, but all the ingredients made this awesome. The only thing that sucks is that I would gladly order the same burger I had last night the next time I go, except I'm not sure which seasoning they actually used. I also would have preferred the pretzel bun, cause it's sturdier, but the split top tasted good too.The fries are also delicious. They are hand-cut, nice and crispy, and flavorful. With a side of truffle mayo (I love truffle, obviously), they are even better. The combination of the amazing burger and delicious fries equals mouth orgasms. I'm sure this place can get pretty busy, but we went at 7 pm on a Friday, and surprisingly were able to get a table right away, and there were still other free tables. It's also BYOB, and I'm sure some people linger to drink, but we were too enveloped in our burgers to drink more than one beer each."
"I was really looking forward to trying this place after reading all the media hype (i.e., Time Out Chicago, Tribune) but I haven't left a restaurant that angry in awhile. I ordered the House Blend beef burger with steakhouse seasoning and the usual suspect garnishes and condiments. I asked for it to be cooked medium. I was given a sacrilegiously overcooked piece of meat that tasted like I was eating dry smoke. Not being that hungry, I didn't ask for a new one but my friend did alert the manager, the gentleman just agreed that it was incorrectly cooked. Then he awkwardly kept staring at me as if it were my job to rectify the situation. Since it took so long to cook anyways, I didn't ask them to redo it. I should have asked for a refund but shame on them for making me have to ask and not offer it. Other complaints. Crazy expensive for what you get. The place smells like a fire pit. You could never go out after eating there because you reek of smoke. How would any chef who's ever run a kitchen before set one up in a way that would enable that to happen. Kuma's will forever have my loyalty. Note: I gave this review 2 stars instead of 1 because they managed not to screw up 50% of the order. My friends burger was cooked fine but lacked any taste of the seasonings they hype. If you are cooking to smoke your burgers so that is the only taste recognizable, at least drop the seasoning hype."
"Mmm..mmm...good.A little pricy, but can you get many burgers like this anywhere else downtown or in the 'burbs? I ordered the regular house burger with the Cajun seasoning, cheddar, fried egg and the truffle mayo. OMG, this is the first time I've ever really tasted truffles in anything I've ordered that supposedly had them as an ingredient...and boy was it tasty.There are a lot of other options for the burger lover as far as toppings go. You choose the type of burger patty you want, how to cook it, which spice mix to season it with, and not a mile-long list of toppings, but one carefully chosen to tickle your taste buds accordingly.The place is BYOB, and they do have some pretty good frozen custard for after dinner on a hot day.I was extremely glad my friend introduced me to this place just around the corner fr where I spend a lot of my time downtown.I'll be going back a lot as the summer goes on!"
"I met a friend for lunch here one day.The man wiping down the tables introduced us to the way of the restaurant and how to order.We were seated, he took our order, and we hung out and waited.The meats are combined with the seasoning you choose.My friend ordered the Shrimp and I ordered the special of the day. The fries were okay....and had a good potato taste.Neither of us tasted our seasoning on our sandwiches/burgers.My burger was missing its bacon and was on the wrong bun.I was excited to like this place, but probably won't be back.It is extremely compact and when it gets busy it is difficult to maneuver within the restaurant.Bike parking down the street."
"If you give me the option to have a fried egg on a burger, how could I refuse? We came here on a Wednesday after work and were able to order and find a seat with no problem (it had really filled up by the time we left so earlier is better). I had the house blend beef with the steakhouse spices and split top egg butter bun with a ton of additional toppings and of course, a perfectly gooey fried egg. The burger was a little more charred than I would have liked but overall it was really tasty. Next time, I would pick a more hearty bun like the pretzel bun to hold it all together. The fries were fantastic...the kind that's actually thick enough to be able to taste the potato and I really appreciated that they don't over salt them. I love that this place is BYOB. I would definitely go back and can't wait to try their breakfast!"
"I'm on a Paleo kick (if a kick is 3 years), so it's always a beautiful thing when there's a place giving me options to eat like that.  Like Grass Fed Beef? Foie Gras? Copious amounts of things made with truffles? Come here. So, I probably should have done more homework, because I showed up not really understanding what this place was.  I thought, heck, it's a new place to eat (I was picturing another DMK bar)... Grabbed a lady friend, and off we went. Well, it's KIND of a place to eat. There is room for about 25 people to eat at any given time, and everyone who is waiting is kind of just jammed up in the front of the joint.  There's no wait-staff to take your order, so you'll wait in line, place the order, get a table, then be served your order when the good folks in the back have prepped your meat. Very hectic. They don't serve alcohol either, it's BYOB. So BYOB, folks. Although maybe BYOM (bring yo' own malbec), because that will just be good.   I got it for takeout last Saturday, and I think that's the way to go here. Called ahead, ready in 15 minutes, told me to jump right to the front of line... I did, and despite the scowls from every person on queue (fun and europeany word), I was out of there quickly. Here's my order, which maybe you guys should copy if you like great food: - 2 grass fed beef patties- Just the salt and pepper- Lettuce bun (eliminating carbs. lay off me, bro, it's almost bathing suit season)- Avocado- truffle mayo- foie gras (you probably can omit this, as it's not very good as it's $12)- site of spinach salad (the goat cheese in the beast is tasty)Ok, gang.  Come here, but maybe get takeout instead.  Either way, your mouth will be happy."
"Was contacted by the owner after leaving the previous review and he informed me that I was given wrong information about the Turkey Burger, it does NOT have bread crumbs in it and therefore would be gluten free! I was very inpressed that he followed up and will be going back soon to try out that Turkey burger!"
"Looking for some juicy cardiac sludging greatness. But the Butcher didn't quite stop my heart. Maybe if I'm in the neighborhood, would give it a try again.Step above M burger and Five Guys.I might rate it similar to Bad Apple, but still not as good as Kuma's or Sola."
"I had the BEST burger of my life at Butcher & The Burger. The location is lovely-- I always wondered why there weren't more restaurants on this stretch of Armitage. It's very smoky inside and you will definitely leave smelling like burgers... but oh my, such delicious burgers. I got the grass-fed beef with steakhouse seasoning. Holy crap, it was incredible. Juicy, meaty, charcoal grill-y, succulent. My boyfriend got the house blend with grandma's onion soup mix and there wasn't a huge different in taste, but mine was just a smidge better. The fries are great, and I can't wait to go crazy with the toppings. The service was totally off on the day that I went-- malfunctioning iPads for taking orders and they brought my boyfriend the wrong burger not once, but twice. I really don't care. I can't wait to go back."
"I gave it 4 stars because its burgers and not a five star culinary experience, but these are some really good burgers.  You can tell that they are fresh and not microwaved dog meat."
"i usually don't like burger, but this surely transforms my mentality. I got referred from a friend whom tried the Foie Gras burger. That is unusual!  I am a Foie Gras fan. I got split-top bun along with truffle mayo with it. OMG! That is very juice, tender, and melts in my mouth...."
"Butcher & the Burger has exceeded all expectations in terms of food and now service, and here's why:This is literally a repeat of what my friend just said, but at this point I would give Butcher & the Burger 10 stars if I could.  In other words, two 5 star reviews is completely called for.  Last time I was here I wanted to buy some roasted elephant garlic.  I forgot like a dumbass so on a return visit I was so intent on buying it.  I finally (happily) remembered and stuffed the little jar of gloriousness in my purse.  After we had finished our beignets, one of the cooks comes up to me.  ""Are you the one that bought the roasted elephant garlic?"" She only knew this because I think the guy who was working the register was new and had to ask the price.  I replied, ""Yes.""  She just begins to apologize while I sit there confused.  She tried the garlic because she had some off feeling about it and apparently something went wrong.  For this she gave me a free meal for me and a friend (OH MY GOD AWESOME), and she offered some free custard.  My friend was full, but I said I'd try the apple caramel.  The custard was actually awesome, and I'm kind of glad this happened because I'm not sure I'd ever try it otherwise.  She even brought a little taste of the passionfruit custard, which I ended up liking more than the caramel apple.  I never expected such a high level of customer service, but Butcher & the Burger really went above and beyond.  I still want some of their roasted elephant garlic; I haven't been deterred at all.  Oh also the onion soup seasoning is awesome."
"I've been to this establishment twice and have had great experiences each time. I was going to be a little adventurous the second time around but I let my boyfriend do that for me. I ordered the Natural & Local House Blend Beef with the Chicago Steakhouse blend seasoning. I added a little truffle mayo, bacon, and cheese and stuck it between a pretzel bun. Needless to say, it was AMAZING!!!! My boyfriend opted for the Elk with Swiss cheese, pickles, tomato, lettuce and ketchup between a pretzel bun as well. He was quite impressed as well. We shared a side of fries that seemed to be double fried because it was crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside.  He checked in on Yelp and that got us one free benigne. It was sweetened just right and was the cherry on top.Working so close to this establishment is dangerous. I have a feeling that I will be a frequent here when that burger craving kicks in."
I LOVE THAT THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES!!!Nothing worse than going to a restaurant and there are only three choices.   The Grass-Fed Beef burger  is my fav :-) because my wife Sue says I get that one cause I am spoiled .Tried both Chicago Steakhouse and the Cameron Parish Cajun Blend... I like the Cajun better. Maybe next time I can build up the courage to try the Burger Meat Sun (ghost  peppers )! Either way I will definitely be back.Another Great Edition to the Lincoln Park neighborhood. Oh yeah great fries too.
"Let me preface this by informing you, the reader, that I am vegan.  My boyfriend, however, is the polar opposite of vegan so we're always on the lookout for meaty restaurants with a vegan option for me - this review is based on our experience as a whole.  Butcher & The Burger offers two vegan patties (Portobello and lentil) along with a plethora of seasonings.  I got my burger with the Cajun seasoning and was excited to receive a well-seasoned lentil burger.  Well to my dismay it was pretty bland and I even doubted if they put seasoning on it.  My boyfriend ordered a burger and when he bit into it it was raw - they took it back and cooked it some more, which was more to his liking.  Mind you, this wasn't an isolated incident as the couple next to us also returned their raw burgers for additional cooking.  To me, it just seemed that Butcher & The Burger just couldn't get it right that day - with the vegan patty and the meat patties.  Based on my experience alone, I wouldn't return for the bland lentil patty.  My boyfriend didn't express any great interest in going back but indicated that may return to give it another shot - hopefully they cook the patty correctly the first time around then.  Kudos to Butcher & The Burger for offering vegan options so that people like my boyfriend can drag their vegan girlfriend to a burger joint."
"I was sitting in my office, thinking about In-n-Out burger.  Wondering when I will have the chance to devour them bastards again.  So I head out in search of a great burger that can satisfy my craving.  Pull out my EVO 4G and awesome Yelp App, I head out to Butcher & The Burger.  It's on Armitage and Sheffield in Lincoln Park.Onto the burger, I ordered the premium blend (medium rare) with Umami seasoning (garlic, ginger, soy sauce and scallions)  topped with lettuce, grilled onions, bleu cheese, mustard and a fried egg.  And of course, gotta have some fries right?HOLY SMOKES.  If the owner came out and confessed to me that he sprinkles crack on their burgers, I would probably believe him.  It was heaven!  All the seasoning throughout the burger, you can taste it in every bite.  I took a bite and felt the runny egg yolk dripping on my chin ( yes, it was the yolk.  not what you are thinking you pervert)  and every bite was an explosion of flavors, Perfectly cooked to medium rare, awesome meat juice combining with all the bitchin flavors!  I'm definitely visiting this place regularly, especially when I'm craving a good burger.  I might have to get a double burger next time.  Try it out with umami seasoning and burger meets sun (ghost chili).  That might be an explosion of flavors! (literally)  People, try this damn place out.  You will love it.  If you don't I will have to punch you in the face.  Yes, I'm that serious!"
"Great burger! All around great experience.First, you get to choose everything about your burger from the meat, the seasoning, the bun and literally everything in between.Incredibly juicy and well cooked burger. It was delicious. Fries great too (and I usually don't like such fresh and straightforward fries).Staff incredibly friendly and helpful."
"Yum! I got the Shrimp Burger (who would have thought: a shrimp burger!) with a wasabi sauce, avocado, and tomato. I sat outside on the patio...what a great summer lunch place! I did think the prices were a little expensive ($3 for one glass of lemonade and $12 for my burger) and the menu slightly confusing (I just got one of the Special pre-put-together burgers since I was feeling pressure to order quickly), but overall this place was pretty awesome! I'd come back!"
"I like that I can make my burger however I want and the grass fed beef. I don't like that the place is smokey and cramped (no seating for a good ten minutes I was there) and it was $10-$12 for just a burger, no drink no fries. I've been to other make-your-own burger places and the prices, from what I recall, were much more reasonable. Glad I tried it, it was yummy, but unless I have a coupon I don't know if I'll be back."
"Okay.If you come here, you absolutely under pain of death must try the onion soup mix as a seasoning. I had it on the grassfed. Grassfed with steak seasoning is perfectly good. Grassfed with onion soup mix is the kind of delicious that is not of this earth. Plus cheddar. On a pretzel roll. With fries. Don't ask questions.However, counter places aren't known for their service because they don't need to be. This one deserves something for what they did for us tonight beyond the other review. My friend has been talking nonstop about this stupid effing roasted elephant garlic jar that they sell here. She finally buys it and has it at our table while we wait for beignets (both flavors are kickass, btw). But near the end one of the girls who works here comes up to our table with the $8 and some other stuff in her hand, and apologizes so profusely but has to ask that she please, please refund us for the garlic because after tasting it she thinks something in it had gone off and can't let her go home with it. She pulled them all off the shelves. In return, she gave my friend the money she spent AND two giftcards for free burgers with fries. And... free custard. It was an honest mistake - it wasn't anything we would have blamed them for or thought twice about - but the beautiful manner they handled it was so over the top, in such a nice way. I never expect that stuff.So obviously this means we are coming back, and we would have even if this didn't happen because the food here is really fantastic. But if a local corner place (let alone any place) is deserving of six stars, this is one that is."
"Went this past Saturday because I read a great review on it. Not worth it!!! Spent $43.00 there for two. Had to swat flies while eating and found a long hair in our fries! The owner was really personable though. Problem is the hipster behind the register looked homeless and she was not friendly. I agree with another review on making the menu easier to order. Love the decor though.One more thing had to get up to find salt, then again for a knife... Just seemed like too much work when I shelled out 43.00"
Since coming here I don't go much elsewhere for burgers.  This is a MUST TRY.  They are epic (especially the ghost pepper).  Incredibly well made and tastes great.  Their fries are amazing and i'd say try the beignets!
"I'd like to try this one again. The idea of BYOB+Burger delights me.From the time I tried it, I dug its vibrations. It's in a cute part of town and has it's own little aura that makes it stand out and memorable from other burger joints. There's no waiter service, so if it's your first time don't stand around and look confused like I did. Walk up to the counter and ask the staff for help if you need, and grab your own spot to sit down while you wait.The patties are great - natural, local. There are bun choices! I love bun choices. And there are unique toppings - wasabi mayo? Spices - Burger meets Sun! Yes please.Apparently there is a butcher (hence the name, obvi) and cooking classes to check out as well.Again, not life changing, but worth a shot...and could definitely become a favorite."
amazing.
Great burgers.  Delicious fries.  BYOB.  Enough said.
"I know...a vegetarian eating at a burger joint?!  Yes...and they have an AMAZING vegan burger (that tastes great dipped in the coconut curry sauce)...with fantastic flavors.  Honestly this was a great meal.The fries are damn good...It is BYOB.  Small place, quiet but nice.I will say it is on the pricier side, but worth checking out, at least once."
"Ordered the Cube Steak burger on a pretzel bun - not great, not bad.My biggest complaint is price and accomodations - burgers weren't worth the extra $3 per burger and the atmosphere is quaint, but seating is limited and uncomfortable.Enjoyed the hi-tech iPad checkout."
"Prior moving to Chicago, I wasn't a burger fan.  After, moving to Chicago and I was fortunate enough to have some GREAT burgers (ie Kuma's, Owen and Engine, Paradise Pup, among a few others.)  Now, I must say I'm a burger fiend. I came here on a very busy Sunday and had an ""Asian Style"" burger.  (Pretzel bun, umami seasoning, bacon, egg, lettuce, tomato, grilled onions and wasabi mayo) w/ fries.)  I must say, for a sub-$10 burger, it's about as good as it gets.  Positives: -Good meat.  I prefer grilled over griddled. -Good service-Great fries-Nice DecorNegatives:-WAY too smokey inside.  The tiny hood they had installed over the grill wasn't enough to ventilate all of the smoke coming from the grill, leaving the dining area in a smokey haze.-Pretzel buns - It seemed like it was maybe a day old.   I tried to cut the burger in half and it fell apart.   Schlegl's Bakery makes great buns - maybe source your bread from there?  I believe Kuma's gets their bread from there.  These buns tasted like they were sourced from Red Hen or La Briola, but Schlegl's Barkery is the best by far.  -Didn't taste much asian seasoning or wasabi on my burgerAll in all, this place is definitely on my top 10 list for great Chicago burgers.   I'll be back soon!"
"Just left, and thoroughly underwhelmed. I ordered a grass fed cheddar cheeseburger plain on wheat, I couldn't taste the burger. The bun was so dry, I could not taste a thing. The fries were also not quite hot, over done, possibly reheated.Maybe I ordered the wrong thing, but I did not leave satisfied. I'll give it another shot in the future I guess."
"WAAAAAY TOO GREASY!!!! I really wanted to like this place after reading such great reviews but it was just way too greasy. I ordered the chicago style seasoning and it really didn't seem to have any seasoning tasting really ""meaty"". I'm talking, not even enough salt! Don't waste $15 for a mediocre burger at this joint. Seriously, my stomach hurts right now!"
"Best burger place ever. Don't know if it was the burgers or the waitress, Sarah. Such a sweetheart. She made the burger taste so much better. SARAH if you see this, it's GARDEN!"
The lentil brown rice burger (which is vegan!) is amazing! This has to be one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had!
"I've hit the motherload.  I can't think of a better burger I've had in years.All the choices to be made were a bit daunting, but I think I made excellent selections.I chose:Patty = House blend beefSpices = Umami GlazeBun = Split Top Egg ButterToppings = Swiss, Griddled Onion, lettuce, tomato, wasabi mayoThe result = a perfectly cooked burger and a bonus: crispy fries and a Mexican coke.All I can say is that I traveled to heaven for a bit.The cons:* Just a small number of tables.* The stools are right by the kitchen, so your clothes end up smelling like smokeWould I go back?  Hell to the yeah!"
"I LOVED this place-incredible veggie burger and now one of my favorites in the city (I've eaten at just about every ""trendy"" new burger joint and tried all their veggie burgers).  Highly recommend getting your burger/veggie burger on a pretzel bread-makes the experience that much better.  My husband ordered the Wagu Beef burger and said it melted in his mouth.  The portions are a good size for one that is hungry.  One downfall, the fries are good but salty!Very unique place, all burgers are served on wooden cutting boards (how cute!!?) and the staff is very friendly and helpful with offering their suggestions.  I had a beignet and it melted in my mouth.  Best part, it was $1! This place knows what it's doing and will have repeat customers again and again.  Place was packed on a Sunday afternoon.We ordered two kid burgers to go and they were a great size and only $4.  What a deal!I will DEFINITELY be back.  Woohoo Butcher you and the burger did it right."
"Try the Cob Burger. There are so many choices and things you could try out, but the burger alone is so delicious that I didn't want to even chance making a bad concoction. Go with what the pros suggest. It's also byob, but given the size and length of stay you'd have to be pretty aggressive to finish anything more than a large craft beer."
"My daughter has been raving about this establishment for months and took me for my first timeWell right now my mouth is just litterly drooling from just  the thought of this burger. I couldnt decide on the Salmon burger or the House Blend. So since it was my first time there I ordered the House Blend Beef Burger w/the Chicago Steakhouse BlendSpice, Cheddar Cheese..Grilled Onions..Pickles, Tomatoes, on the Butter Bun. All I can say is YUM-O. and will be back.. Oh my daughter had the Chocolate Peanut Butter Custard AWESOME."
"Recently walked over to B&B after wanting to try it for months. We live a couple blocks away, and finally on a Saturday afternoon we saw that the line wasn't too long, so we decided to give it a go.Now, I would like to preface this by saying that I really feel that my partner and I would give them two different reviews, based on on our individual food experiences.Me: grass fed beef, grandmas onion soup mix, and all the fixins...including, yes, avocado on a whole wheat bun. Cooked perfectly, the cheese oozed just right, and the onion soup mix gave it just a little kick.Him: grass fed beef, simple mix, blue cheese on a pretzel bun. His pretzel bun was delish. Then he found a hair when he was chewing. Ok, so, we chalked it up to maybe being mine because I have long flowing locks. Chew, chew, chew....another hair....dark, inside the meat patty,most definitely not mine. At this point, he was entirely grossed out, and we realized the girl working the grill didnt have a hair net on.The manager was so nice, and agreed to make him a completely new burger, which he received and ate most of, but at this point he was a little wary. At the end of our trip, the manager came by again with a coupon for a free meal if we were to come back and try again, so I give them props for that. Good customer service.Id give this place a 4, he gives it a 2, so we meet in the middle. Hopefully we can come back another day and update those stars, because we really want to love you, B&B!"
"As other reviewers have mentioned, I am also sure that I had the best burger I have ever tasted here. You know that idea of flavor in your brain sometimes, when you see the pictures of manicured burgers in advertisements, and you imagine how they taste like, well this is it for me, this is what I've been searching for. I have tried several places in the city, although not too many, but since I was here I really do not want to go anywhere else. Their burgers are not overly greasy, not overdone, they are perfect. I haven't played much with the ingredients since I already found what I like: grass fed beef with Chicago seasoning, blue cheese, grilled onions, tomato and pickle... yes please!I am sure they have to be one of the best, if not number one in Chicago, I know they are for me."
"Some of the best burgers I have ever had. I have now been there twice, and the first time I made the very odd ""mistake"" (in quotes because it turned out to be a success) of ordering a salmon burger. This is coming from a person who hates salmon. Yeah, I have a habit of making weird impulsive decisions at restaurants when under pressure to order. The point is, the salmon burger was absolutely delicious. I got it on an egg butter bun with simple seasoning and (I think) just lettuce and tomato. The second time I was under less pressure to order (thank goodness - I think it was a good idea to come on a rainy Friday afternoon at around 11am), and I ordered one of the ""suggested"" burgers, which consisted of the house blend beef, simple seasoning, egg butter bun, with American cheese, pickles, lettuce, tomato, mustard, and ketchup (I omitted the onions). Absolutely fantastic (albeit traditional) burger. I must also mention that their fries are very addictive.My only complaint (which is probably just a complaint for people like me, who have ""ordering anxiety"" when several people are staring at me expectantly and rushing me along to accommodate others behind me in line) is the ordering process. Maybe this means I need to come on weird days/at weird times. I think I just get overwhelmed with all of the options. Nonetheless, I highly recommend Butcher and the Burger for all types of burgers!"
"This place is pretty awesome. If you like to customize your burger and literally pick every single aspect, this place is for you. I'm kind of lazy so sometimes this idea wouldn't appeal to me but I was in the mood to try something new yesterday and this fit the bill. I ordered a turkey burger with the simple rub (salt and pepper) on a split egg butter top bun. I chose to put cheddar on it with raw onions, lettuce, ketchup, and mayo. My boyfriend got the grass fed prime beef on a split top egg butter bun with wasabi mayo, goat cheese, onions, and lettuce with fries. The burgers came out about 10 minutes later on planks. I bit into mine and it was easily the best turkey burger that I've ever had. They cooked it medium well but for the beef you get to select how you want it prepared. My boyfriend's was amazing and the fries were somehow sweet and salty at the same time. It's a bit stuffy in there and I was hot and feeling overwhelmed after sitting for 15 minutes. There isn't a lot of seating here but it was a problem when I went on a Wednesday night around 6. My only complaint with the food was that the rolls were overpowering. There was so much bread while the patty was just average size. The staff was also kind of awkward and didn't really know what was going on when we were ordering but I feel like that will wear off when they have more experience.*I updated my review from 4 to a 5 due to the fact that the owner personally contacted me and explained some of my issues. Way to provide excellent customer service, I commend you."
"So I will fully admit that I am not a great judge when it comes to hamburgers because you would generally have to run over one with a car and pour crap on it for me not to like it. And even then I would probably take a bite so as not to waste the meat. But trust me when I say that Butcher & The Burger has some of the best burgers I've tasted in a very long time. I ordered mine as the Prime grass-fed beef (92/8 protein to fat ratio in case you were wondering) without a bun (Dukan Diet regulation) and added grilled onions and mushrooms with mustard. To no one's surprise, I also got a fried egg on top. The patty was perfectly cooked to medium rare with some spectacular juiciness. I also added the Greek spices to it. I was curious as to what it would taste like but not disappointed. The spices really brought out a lot of the salty flavors of the beef. It was bold but not overpowering. I would love to go back and try the elk burger because that sounded really intriguing as well. I didn't get to try the french fries due to my diet but my friend didn't seem to have any trouble devouring every last bite! I would totally go back to this place despite the slightly higher cost (a bit more expensive than Five Guys) and wait (about 15 minutes and the place gets pretty packed because there is a small eating area). I really have nothing major to complain about with this place. I'll be back soon to try more of their meat chocies, maybe including breakfast!!!Oh and you order on an iPad! I love restaurants incorporating technology."
"This place was really awesome.  It had great flavors, BYOB, awesome service, cool atmosphere...  I'm a fan!  I got the shrimp burger with the cajun seasoning and some homemade pickles.  I was in HEAVEN.  I can't wait to go back here."
My wife and I stopped by the Butcher & The Burger last Friday when we were in the neighborhood.  We were kicking around some places to go but I just had a hankering for a good old fashioned American hamburger.  Being that I've heard so many good things we decided to give it a try. It's quite an interesting ambiance when you walk in.  The smell of the grill wafts about the space.  The restaurant is not by any means a large space and would be cozy at best.  Seating is simple wooden tables and chairs with counter space all along the perimeter.  They do not take reservations so you better show up early and bring some libations.  They are BYOB.  Their burger hit the spot!  We just went with their standard natural and local house blend beef with Chicago steakhouse seasoning on a pretzel bun.  Of course you have to have everything on it.  The burger came cooked (medium) as ordered with just the right amount of juiciness and firmness with a nice finish from the pretzel bun.  To be quite honest this had to have been one of the best burgers that I have had in Chicago.  I cant wait to come back when the urge hits!
"This review is for breakfast only.  Tasty breakfast sandwiches with good quality ingredients served by a friendly staff.  The beniets, however, were a little dense for my taste."
"I had the grass fed burger meets the sun and it was better than Kumar's. Spicy and juicy! Plus no smoke, loud music, or 2 hour wait for table. I also got the potatoe soup which was very tasty as well. Another plus is the fact that it is BYOB and we parked right in front of the place. They lost my friend's order so, he didn't receive his burger until we were half way done with our burgers but the manager gave him a card to receive a free burger next time. Good customer service! I will be back with my appetite!"
Grass fed goodness done right.  One of the top five Chicago burger candidates!  See the full review with pictures from Hungry Hungry Hinden...hungryhungryhinden.com/2…
Food OK - Customer Service could use some training.  A friend and I were starving and wanted a good burger so we went there on Saturday.  She had the veggie option and I had the basic burger which I ordered with cheddar cheese.   Burger and fries arrive no cheese.  So the waitress takes my burger AND my fries back.  5-10 minutes later she brings the now cold burger with melted cheese and cold fries back.  Worse the burger which was supposed to medium well is now medium.  She finanally brought out hot fries which were very good butmby that time my burger was cold.  Sad...For $22 we expected and should have received the order cooked to specification and if you get it wring make it right instead of half^*g it.
"I've been looking for this burger for years in Chicago.  I've never  understood why it's so hard to make a burger that is well proportioned (translation: doesn't make you feel like you will die before you take the last 3 bites) and uses quality ingredients (fresh meat and a list of condiments to please any taste).  It's refreshing to go to a restaurant that isn't an event but still has an awesome burger.  While places like Kuma's and Urban Burger Bar are great, I'm certainly not going to go there more than once a month...and I always leave hating myself.  B&TB is literally your neighborhood burger joint, but better.I'm normally a pretzel bun guy, but the split top butter bun is outstanding and a good fit for the size of the patty (~6 ounces).  Oh, and the ""kennebec"" fries are on point with just the right amount of sea salt.  Allegedly they have a rotation of special cheeses that I will have to check out next time.The space is small, so be prepared to wait 10 mins for a seat once you've ordered, or take it home if you live nearby.  It's not cheap, but neither is Johnny Rockets down the street, and it's 10x better."
"My first experience here and I think it will be my last. First, the whole idea of this place is wonderful. I know little about meat but I loved the idea of picking everything myself. However, I had no idea what I wanted so I just went with the recommended burger, which I believe was called the classic American. It seemed juicy and tasty, and I loved that there was more than one pickle on the burger, but something about this was a serious problem. The whole thing tasted like it was doused with vinegar. I even took out the pickles and onion to see if that alleviated the problem but it didn't. It tasted really horrible and it was impossible to eat. I barely managed to eat half of it.Now the fries were delicious, but they were the second problem. Great texture, flavor, and I love that the skins were still on. They would have been successful, but these fries were completely covered with salt. They were so heavily coated that I think they had more salt than McDonald's fries, and those fries have a lot of salt. I felt sick after only a handful of fries. Like the burger, I could barely eat any, and I ended up tossing the whole meal. I hope they reduce the salt they use on their fries. I saw that some other reviewers on here agreed that they were too salty. The whole meal came out to being over 16 dollars and I'm not sure why it was so expensive, but it wasn't worth it at all."
Great burgers! BYOB joint with many build-your-own-burger choices and topics - let the imagination run wild. My only problem with Butcher & the Burger was the air circulation or lack or thereof - they need a better ventilation system!
"One of the best burgers I have ever had!  I went all out and got the fried egg and bacon.  Wow - not something you could do often....but great to taste once!  The spices were so good we all bought some to take home.  It was also a wonderful experience.  I was with some close friends, we got an outdoor table, it was 80degrees and sunny - so the setting was perfect for a great lunch connection with friends.  Then, I got my burger and it was done more than I had ordered.  They were SO good with that.  It was almost like they were embarrassed and quickly went and got a new one.  (They also left the other....which with the large group got eatten as well!)  We had ordered one order of beinets to come fresh at the end, they brought a couple more orders and had overheard that it was my birthday so they put a candle in one!  Very thoughtful and they were SOO good!  VERY casual....and I can imagine that it would be hard to find ""good"" seating normally.  We were there mid-week and late after the lunch rush.  So, that would normally cause me to drop it down to 4 stars but truly the burger is worth it!!  Just go expecting that!"
"I really love getting a burger at Butcher & The Burger. They have a wonderful variety of meats, spices, toppings, buns - everything you might want to get on a burger is represented on the menu. They really pack a ton of flavor into the most straightforward burger, and the pretzel buns are phenomenal.The only real drawbacks are the slightly expensive prices and a moderately overwhelming menu, which can be stressful when there are people behind you waiting to order and you are trying to figure out how to put together your burger from the huge list of options. The staff have been helpful in suggesting things to me, however, which makes it a little easier.After being to both B&TB and Kuma's Corner twice, I can honestly say the burgers at B&TB are equal to, or better than, Kuma's burgers, but without the absurd wait. I've gone there at 1pm and walked right up and ordered a burger - try THAT at Kuma's.Highly recommended."
"Great farm to table, locally sourced food.  The avocado, goat cheese, tomato, and egg breakfast sandwich is wonderful.  I highly recommend this restaurant/deli.  I say deli because they make and sell their own brats.  I purchased some of the veil brats and bought them to a BBQ where they were a hit.Here are just a few things I want to mention:They raise their own pigs. (they take farm to table that seriously).They make homemade custard.They offer cooking classes.They are very eco-friendly.I love to support small businesses with heart like this one."
"This burger spot is in a wonderfully unique location, tucked into one of the historic buildings along Armitage. There is a neat old fashioned scale as you enter, and fun stuff to look at along the walls, there are a handful of tightly packed tables up front, and a row of counter dining along the side (bonus the red seats can swivel out from underneath the counter - a very neat design aesthetic. From the packed atmosphere in this place you'd think there were no other dining options along Armitage. EVERYONE is coming to Butcher & The Burger. It's new. It's got a great location. The staff is friendly. The burgers are A-OK. So why not right?I agree this is a nice addition to the neighborhood and worth a visit, but I think the concept is similar to national chain The Counter. You pick your burger, toppings, seasonings, bun, and they'll make it. I like that things are locally sourced here that is a bonus. I enjoyed my salmon burger with the umami seasonings; it was good. The fries, were fine, but nothing special. I did like that they offered Mexican Coke served in the bottles.This is not the place to come with a large group. It's tough to get a table on the weekend and you'll be packed into your spot like little sardines. They forgot my friends burger and fries order too. They brought her husbands and mentioned hers was on it's way...10 minutes later she asked and they realized they'd forgotten it. I do want to mention they gave her a coupon to use on a future visit though. I think they still have some little kinks like that they'll need to work out."
"The Cobb Burger was absolutely fantastic.  Hard for me to add to all the other reviews about the burgers.  They delivered on the hype.  Additionally, the fries were ridiculous.  All washed down with a bottled coke.  Simply the best. Now I just need to make it back for breakfast."
"Girlfriend took me here for my birthday. I'm not too fussy, and on a rainy cold Monday night, all I wanted was a burger.  There's a choice of about 7-8 meats, more spice rubs, 4 buns, multiple freebies, and a list of outstanding extras at additional cost.   Also heirloom potato fries, which I thought sounded pretentious and stupid at first.  Turns out I'm a complete jackass, as they were the best fries I've ever had. Pluses:BYOBWonderful Owner who will offer his HONEST opinions and stop to chat.DecorCLEANLINESSLocation (close to the brown line)Minuses:Could get crowded due to small size"
"Not too bad.Went there on a Friday after work, around 6 pm.  No wait and plenty of seating available.  It took a long time for our food to come out, we noticed other people (who had come in after us) being served.  No big deal, to me, though I'm patient enough.  The burgers were good, but the real winner was the fries!  Nice and thick cut, the right amount of crisp and the sea salt was just before the point of ""too much"".  Perhaps I will go back and try out some of their other seasonings in combination with other toppings.  The only real turn off to this place is that they have a bit of an air-flow problem.  The smoke from all the cooking would quickly fill up the place, coupled with the fact that it's summer and just hot in general.  Made for a rather gross dining atmosphere."
"This place is right in the area where I take my lunch break so myself and some friends we're dying to get in there and try it.Pros:-The food over all is pretty outstanding. I would rate the burger 4/5 stars it was delicious fresh beef. The fries and glass of root-beer we're also incredible.-The theme is unique and I liked getting my meal presented on a butchers blockCons:-Too expensive for a burger... I ordered their standard burger with fries and a bottle of root beer and it was $15 and some change. C'mon that's expensive even for a Lincoln Park. -We waited 25min to get our food... I understand they are trying to make ""gourmet"" burgers here, but at the end of the day its should still be relatively fast.I might check this place out again in a couple months see what has changed."
"Some of my co-workers and I went in for lunch. Apparently they have only been open for a week! Seriously, if you gave this place a bad review you are either crazy or experienced the first week's growing pains. This place is awesome and will hopefully become a lunch hour spot for me.I ordered the grass-fed beef with the Asian seasoning, goat cheese and Wasabi mayo. I ordered it cooked medium and it was probably the best example of a medium burger. Pink through the middle, cooked on the outside. Just how I like it. Probably one of the BEST burgers I have had.To top it off, these fries are the best I have ever had period. The owner told the table next to us that the potatoes he uses are a kind that hadn't been used for a while. Just enough salt and they were crispy on the outside, perfect on the inside.I wish they had beer here though. It would go well with burgers and fries. But I think it is BYOB?Honestly, I can't say enough good things about this place. The owner was nice, the service was great (albeit not fast-they care about the way they cook so it can't be), and the atmosphere suits it well. I'm glad we got in before there was a line out the door. I can tell this place will be popular."
"Definitely one of the better burger places in Chicago, but the burgers were upstaged by the wonderful fries. These kennebec fries are excellent. A thicker cut, crisp exterior, soft interior, nicely salted. The fries do not come with the burger, but I highly recommend ordering them. Butcher & the Burger is a create-your-own burger concept. There are no pre-set combinations. My burger-- house blend beef ($8.50), sea salt and pepper seasoning, egg bun, cheddar, bacon ($2), fried egg ($1), truffle mayonnaise ($1), fries ($2.50). Total: $17.17. Each component of the burger was well-executed. Beef cooked as requested, cheese melted, runny yolk on the egg, great truffle mayonnaise. Overall, I found the burger delicious but not life-changing. The fries were more memorable. I can get burgers just as, or more, fantastic for less money at other establishments. Stellar fries. Enjoyable burgers. Somewhat high price tag. Recommend if you don't mind spending a little more for your burger."
"I must admit that my review may be based on a bias I had coming in...I had very high expectations from friends saying it was a great burger (on Kuma's level good). Let's just say it was good, but for the price, there are better option out there. I had the regular burger with cajun spice. The menu itself was quite confusing. Each option (the burger type, spice, cheese, toppings, etc.) was in a different section and it was hard to manage at the register. I loaded my burger up with all the fixings, sparing no expense, and got a side of small fried for good measure. The fries were a bit salty, but still good. In all I recommend the place as a good neighborhood spot and would come back. Maybe give breakfast a try instead of CBA one day when I am feeling something new."
"Not my favorite burger joint in the city (see my Lockdown Bar review), but this is a heckofa burger.I couldn't taste the seasoning in either burger I tried, but it was delicious nonetheless.  Quality-wise on par with Kuma's though a little smaller, I think.  Very good fries.There was a hiccup with our order because the cashier didn't hear me say ""for here"" and again with the food runner because there was more than one Kevin waiting for food but these are just one-off incidents.With so many quality burger places clustered on the North side, I may not find myself back here for awhile.  It's definitely worth a whirl, though."
"Ommiiigaaah! Had their breakfast sandwich yesterday and I almost cried.Non-greasy, smoky bacon, perfectly fluffy eggs, avocado, and goat cheese between a big 'ol fluffy croissant. A burger joint that has also perfected the breakfast sandwich? COME ON. You're killin' me."
"Loved this place. Got there right after work, which was a great thing because it started to get packed by the time we were out of there. Picked up a six pack to share while waiting for another to arrive. The staff was very friendly and knowledgable. Had a the standard burger with cajun seasoning, cheddar, onions, pickles and bacon. Also had fries on the side. The burger was great. Very juicy and not too big that you're uncomfortable after eating it. Check this place out, if you haven't already."
"AAAAAAMAZING! The food was really fresh, quick and delicious. There are so many choices and options so even the pickiest of eaters and the most adventurous will be satisfied. I'm giving it one start down because of price, lack of side with the burger and it's a little crowded and overwhelming inside. If you can't handle tight spaces, you're probably best off ordering to go."
"I'd say the burgers were 4 stars, but at $40 for two people this was a 3 star experience.  The burger was pretty decent. The fries were good. The shake was a little disappointing. Really like the setup here, but don't think I'll be back."
Seen Butcher and the Burger on Best in Chow Burger Wars Chicago I had to try it out. Excellent burger it was cooked and seasoned prefect!! The fries were great and washed it down with a nice draft Root Beer!! The girl behind the counter was really helpful and explained everything to me!! Defintaly come back and recommend!! Nice job
Service and staff were great. I really liked the fries and custard. We were glad there was outdoor seating.
"Definitely not your run of the mill burger joint - you are able to choose your choice of bun, meat (grass-fed beef, elk, shrimp, vegan, etc), choice of rub/seasoning, condiments, etc. Very good burger. The french fries were the best I've had anywhere -bit of the steak fry variety and they're cooked all the way through to golden perfection. The price is the only downside - $30 for the two of us with pops (BYOB). The price does not dissuade me from wanting to come back - I want to try to their breakfast sandwiches - the concept is great and they deliver a very tasty fulfilling burger experience.EDIT: I originally rated B&B four stars but have since upgraded it to five. I was graciously contacted by the owner and let's just say they deserve their fifth star very much :)"
"***REVIEW MAINLY FOR VEGGIE PATTY & PARTIALLY FOR MEATY PATTY***Having read this in Men's Health Magazine as the ""America's Manliest Burger Joint ""me , (veggie head) and the lady, (mostly veggie, sometimes meaty), had to try this burger spot. Not for the manly thing but because hey, we want some damn good burgers! Having arrived the staff was very friendly and helpful with our burger creations and made tons of recommendations without being to overwhelming. A good sign. I chose the Inferno Burger, a special of theirs for the day with the lentil veggie patty. I figured whatever flavors lack in a veggie patty will be masked by the pre chosen toppings of habanero jack cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and ghost pepper seasoning. How sad I was to assume. The burger was dry and bland and mildly spicy at most. I had to drench it with ketchup & mustard to give it some flavor. The one good thing was the sweet pickles. The fries were crispy & hard and tasted overcooked which some may prefer but not me. They lose their fry flavor in my opinion when overcooked. The lady ordered a traditional American Classic Burger which she stated was ""OK"" but when you pay $22 for 2 burgers & small fries you expect more than ""OK"".  I still need to search other places for delectable burgers but for now I stick with Kumas Corner for some flavorful veggie burgers and fries."
"The food tasted good but it was a bit pricey. The food was not anything spectacular.  I ordered a salad and it was drenched in dressing. The burger was cooked how I wanted and it tasted great. I got bacon and eggs on them. The food to-go looked delicious, like meatballs, but were very expensive.  I will not be trying those. Though if I were craving a burger, I would probably go to DMK (a sit down restaurant) or maybe even just Five Guys. The staff was friendly and offered suggestions."
"I love burgers, I love meat, I love being able to get chicory coffee outside of New Orleans because I miss it there so very much. The fact I can do this all in one place is golden. I've eaten a lot of burgers (yeah it probably shows so get over it) and these burgers are my go-to in the city. Epic Burger, Urban Burger Bar, even Kuma's move over! The meat is incredibly fresh for you other meat snobs out there as are the fries for the carb fans. Yes it takes time, yes you may pay more than fast food like Five Guys or Johnny Rockets, but if you really want a good burger, it's worth it. For those who didn't like it here, sorry... more for me! Just stop beginning your reviews with, ""OH I really didn't want to give this a bad review... I really wanted to like it."" Suck it up and just say what you mean. Butcher & The Burger for the win."
"After hearing about B&TB in December, I added it to my 'places to try' list.  Finally my wait is over and came in today for my first time.  OMG!  I don't know what took me so long to try this place!  There was no wait when I got there seeing as how it was an off time.  The service was great.  I ordered the elk with the creek bottom game mix, swiss cheese, lettuce, onion, BBQ sauce, a fried egg, on a pretzel roll.  The cashier was helpful in recommending the appropriate spice and doneness of the meat, which was great.  The elk is pricier but if you're willing to pay for a Kuma burger (trust me I am) then price shouldn't be a big deal.  Amazing burger!Overall the food was great and the service was phenomenal.  I'll definitely be making more trips to B&TB."
I really enjoyed this place. Everything is fresh and made to order with all lots of customizable options. I tried the onion soup mix as a seasoning for my burger and it was delicious. Fries were really good as well.I will be back to try more.
"Excellent (but can be inconsistent)first visit:  Over done and over hyped!!    after waiting in a slow line, ordered the burger medium rare.  it came well done to the point of ultra well done.  crackly crispy outside, dark grey and bone dry inside.  if over-cooking like this, it matters not what quality meat they use.significantly over-priced for what they serve.biggest over-hyped burger since DMK (who also overcooks, tho not to this extent).instead of here, find a GREAT burger at owen & engine.second visit:   ordered same burger combo.  this time it was delightful.  juicy.  tasty.  a pleasure to eat.  service was attentive and communicative.  the way B&tB was this time makes it a good burger destination."
"I love the concept of this place, but my burger missed the mark. I ordered medium and got a burger that was browned well throughout and the outside was all black. HOWEVER, they randomly have beignets and chicory coffee! Which awesome! Kinda funny that the counter guys know they have chicory coffee but don't know what cafe au lait is, and the beignets taste different than traditional ones since they lightly flavor the dough... but whatever, I'm in Chicago and can have cafe au lait and a beignet for breakfast. That's rad."
"GREAT burgers!  I live next door to this place so I eat there all the time.  However, even if I lived farther away I would still be a frequent visitor.  The food is fantastic every single time I go.  You should be aware that they cook their burgers to a true temperature.  What I mean by that is if you order medium-rare, you will truly get medium-rare.  So many bars, restaurants, and even burger places will overcook their patties.  With that said, if you are used to ordering medium-rare, you probably want medium at this place.  I'll also tell you this - there is NO bad combination of spice and toppings.  Every potential combo is good.Seating is VERY limited.  There are only a few tables inside and out, so if it's a busy night, you may wait for a while.  However, it is BYOB, so that will make the wait worth while."
"I live in the neighborhood so when this opened I was very excited. After two visits...not so much.First visit: Grass fed beef - medium, on a pretzel roll with onion soup mix, cheddar, mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, onion, pickle and tomato with a side of fries. Luckily, my burger was a good size and was extremely tasty and juicy despite being cooked medium-well. Another con - the fries were cold :( .Second visit: I decided to try almost the same burger to be consistent. Grass fed beef - medium, on a pretzel roll with onion soup mix, cheddar, black truffle mayo, lettuce, onion, pickle and tomato with a side of fries. This time my burger patty was very very thin....this is probably why it was cooked WELL DONE! I feel like if you have 'Burger' in your business' name this should be something that you get right ALL THE TIME! Unfortunately, my burger was not juicy like last time. I did not want to send it back since it was busy and my friend was enjoying her burger (even though it was overcooked, too). The pretzel roll was also very hard. On the plus side this time, my fries were SO yummy...they were hot and perfectly seasoned.Burgers: 2.5 starsFries: 3.5 starsNot sure if I will be making a trip back anytime soon..."
"Went mid afternoon for a late lunch. Sorry, but for a place that only does burgers, I expect it to be f in spot on but it was far from it. Very disappointing."
"I have been here on four occasions, all for breakfast sandwiches.  First, the food was great.  I am a huge breakfast person and have ordered different breakfast sandwiches along with the beignets (very tasty!) and you will definitely not leave hungry.  Everything I have eaten here has been delicious.The reason I am only giving 4 stars is I think some kinks need to (or maybe they have been?) worked out with the service.  Other than the time I ordered in advance for take out, I have waited a very long time (in my world of how long a breakfast sandwich should take even if it is top notch) - probably about 25-30 min.  One time they messed up the order after we waited!  The manager came over and was very apologetic and gave us a coupon for 2 free breakfast sandwiches for the wait and the mix-up, so I think they were maybe just having a rough day.Overall, if you want a great meal and are not in a rush, I highly recommend this place."
"I love burgers, and I love places who dedicate themselves to crafting really great, original, well executed burgers. Unfortunately Butcher & The Burger regularly fall short compared to a lot of places in the neighborhood. There are few pro's: There are tons of different ways you can customize your burger, from rubs to speciality fixings to different cheeses and sauces, it's BYOB, and the place has a great neighborhood feel to it. I think most of the prose ends there though- The negatives far outweigh the novelty of creating your own burger- The burgers here are at best average, but you tack on the $12-$14 price tag for a burger with anything on it plus $5 for fries, something to drink and tax and you're looking at $20-$25 for a meal. That's fine if it's a great burger and excellent service, but both elements leave something to be desired. The burgers are pretty generic for what they're claiming to be. I would much rather go to DMK or Burger Bar (both walking distance from Butcher/Burger) and have a much more satisfying meal. For the same price at either of those two places you're guaranteed to get a full service, more original, better tasting burger with sides and drinks. If you're in the neighborhood and it's convenient, I'd say give this place a shot and form your own opinion, but as someone who lives down the street and having been here a handful of times, I'd say spend a few extra minutes walking north (DMK) or south (Burger Bar) for a better meal."
"The elusive ""frozen custard stand burger"" has finally come to Chicago at Butcher & The Burger! For those who are from Milwaukee, think Kopp's, Gilles, and Leon's - but a few steps up - 'nuff said.Creating your customized burger is difficult because of the extensive choices for each part.  You choose meat, preparation, spice, bun, cheese, condiments, extras, etc.  The meat + spice combination is the key to creating the perfect burger.  Look at the menu carefully, and ask for recommendations if you need help.The fries were crispy and salty.  The custard (vanilla and pumpkin) was a bit more firm than is served in Milwaukee, but tasted perfect.The decor screams 1920's burger stand, with old-time pieces from butcher shops, and soda fountains.Sunday evening @ 7pm was not busy, but not empty either.  I wouldn't be surprised if B&TB is swarming next summer for dinner - every day.  Check it out now before everybody else has!"
"Too many choices, but in a good way! I think you could randomly choose the meat, spice, toppings, and bun and not make a mistake. My shrimp burger and my friend's traditional beef burger were fantastic! I ordered the Surf burger with lettuce wrap in an attempt to be healthy. The shrimp burger was full of cut up shrimp versus breading. The avocado and wasabi mayo worked well with the lettuce wrap. My friend ordered fries and beignets for us...so much for being healthy! The fries are thick, salty, and flavorful, but were a little heavy. The Beignets were a little denser than what I am used to, but tasted like classic Cafe Du Monde. I loved them! The cinnamon topping was a nice touch. What IS served at Butcher and Burger is scrumptious. I'm not giving five stars because of what  IS NOT at Butcher and The Burger....ample seating, proper ventilation, plates, and side dishes. The dining are is TINY and tables of two sit on top of each other. The outdoor seating affords tables of four, but this place is not good for groups. Since its BYO, I would really like to be able to share my bottle of wine, but my friends will have to sit outside. The kitchen is exposed to the dining area, so you will leave smelling like smoky burgers. The food is served on small cutting boards, so you will lose a few fries, toppings, etc trying to work through the massive burgers. The sides vary, but are usually starch heavy. Don't plan on ordering a side salad or steamed vegetables with your burger, its pasta salad, tuna salad, etc. I'm not sure who orders a burger with a side of tuna salad, but take my advice and order as my pregnant gal pal did, burger, pretzel bun with a side of fries and two beignets. PS - I might rank Butcher and The Burger equal or better than DMK and Kumas. B&B's burgers are bigger than DMK's burgers and there are better bun options. Compared to Kuma's, (1) I can actually get a burger here, where I would still be waiting in line at Kumas. (2) Its also easier to sub out ingredients as the menu is pretty much a la carte AND there a limitless combos. (3) I'm not straining my mouth trying to get a hunk of brie, pear, and massive meat, plus bun into my mouth...ie.you can actually eat the burger without deconstructing it.PSS - B&B is next to the Armitage Brown line. AWESOME location."
"They have all types of meat and non-meat options (portobello, ground meat, elk, turkey, etc.). You pick the bun, the meat, the seasoning, the cheese, and your toppings. We also had fries and truffle mayo. I had the grass-fed meat and my friend had the portobello). They cook the meat medium rare and it was very tasty. The fries also are worth it. The downside is the price and the small size of the place. Also they say they have a ""store there,"" but all they have is like 4 meats to choose from if you want to take them home, and random jars of food like garlic and olives. And there is maybe only a handful of those.Burger with fries, a side of mayo, and a bottle of rootbeer was $19 (pretty steep.) The plus side is it's BYOB and you order at the counter which means no topping. So that savings does make a difference.It's worth going if you want a good burger (meat or veggie), you plan to BYOB, you're party if no more than 4 people, and it's early in the evening (otherwise you're going to have a wait).At the end of the day it's a damn good burger."
"I thought B&TB was pretty reasonably priced, the menu was broad in terms of burger and non-burger options, and the food was good. Unfortunately my burger didn't come with blue cheese as I had ordered (my friend had the same problem) but for that my love handles say 'Thanks!' The ventilation leaves something to be desired: I washed my clothes but they still smell like I just left. BYOB and mint Oreo custard help make up for it."
"While the the look and feel of this place is homey and comforting, I won't be returning. Like a few others who've written reviews, I was very underwhelmed with both the burgers and the fries. There are much better, and cheaper options, in an equally attractive atmosphere nearby (I'm thinking Burger Bar on Clybourne, which has a supremely stronger beer list -- another draw.)I agree that all the options on a single board coupled with pressure to order quickly is a bit overwhelming. We visited when there wasn't a line (although the dining room was nearly full), and the man at the counter didn't seem to suggest we should take our time. Both my date and I ordered the sirloin burger (me with steakhouse and he with Cajun seasoning) and fries. Had I had more time to taken in the menu, I probably would have ordered something more exotic. Both the burgers arrived very undercooked; I had ordered medium and the burger had barely a ring of brown around the red and pink. The fries were flimsy; I prefer crispy. I know though a lot of critics have lauded this place (including my faves at Chicago Magazine), so perhaps it's that it's either a big hit or a big miss at Butcher & the Burger. Me, though, I've always preferred consistency. Next time I'm craving a burger near Armitage, I'll opt for Burger Bar, Epic Burger or - heck - even Johnny Rockets."
"Eh. Maybe this place was too hyped up for me. I just didn't dig it.The custom burger building is a phenomenal concept, and they have SO many things you can do. I gravitated towards the salmon burger, the bf got a veggie patty and we split fries and beignets.First - their beignets are not like Cafe du Monde's, despite using their mix. They spice them with something. Disappointing for a NOLA fan, but I can appreciate creativity. Next time just tell me that they're different, not that you're making Cafe du Monde beignets.Second - the iPads are cool, but it's seriously time consuming to order. When we walked in, there were 2 girls at the counter taking their time, so we figured the lovely man walking around with an iPad would be faster. We admitted it was our first time there and asked for recommendations. He had some favorites, but it seemed he hadn't tried a lot of combinations on their menu. Third - Being a fan of spicy sushi I was excited to try the salmon burger with some heat. Sadly the rub recommended didn't add much and the burger was pretty flaky. It was okay, but nothing I was psyched to take home as leftovers.Last - It's kinda pricey.. and I'm not quite sure what we paid extra for... We got 2 burgers (without additional $ for toppings/rubs), a free beignet from Yelp, a $1 beignet, regular fries to split, and 1 drink. It was just over $30. Wow."
"We went this Saturday for lunch and were disappointed.  When we walked in, we had to ask where to order because there was no obvious ordering system in place.  Then we were approached by one of the workers with an ipad to order.  She took our order and we paid with her but she had to print out the receipt to sign in a whole different area of the restaurant!  Not efficient at all.  I loved the menu concept of building our own burger and adding the unique spices.  However, both of our burgers were so over cooked that all you could taste was the char.  The owner was extremely nice and hard working but very flustered as I believe this was their first Saturday lunch crowd.  Some words of advice - (1) need more efficient ordering and payment system (2) Do not over cook the burgers!!"
"If you like burgers you will like Butcher & The Burger, period. This place does grilled ground meat The Right Way™. My order: Grass-fed beef patty, basic salt+pepper seasoning, bleu cheese, bacon, lettuce, split bun, cooked medium-rare....plus fries.The result: About 10-12 minutes later (it was moderately busy, even on a rainy Tuesday at 2pm) I was presented with a cutting block upon which my burger and fries proudly sat. The first bite was perfect; tender and juicy meat, crispy medium-thick bacon, and a moderate helping of cheese. The bun remained non-soggy throughout the experience, which I truly appreciate. The fries were crispy outside and mushy in the middle, like they should be! No grease fries here. I left fulfilled with a desire to return some time soon. Being so close to the Armitage stop, it'll be hard to find a reason not to go.Oh yeah my burger, fries and a tea were ~$18 (including bacon).Go there."
"Ok, my wife strong armed me into going again. It was a Saturday afternoon, cold outside (12 Jan2013 at 1130am). The food was great! Looks like they worked out the particulars. $33.00 for 2 adult burgers and a kiddy. I would dine here again."
I went with some friends last night(Tuesday). My burger was delicious(Prime with Chicago Steakhouse seasoning with traditional toppings) but what I appreciated the most was the service. It's rare that you go to a burger place and get so much attention from each employee. Even our busboy came over to chat with us and asked us several times if we had everything we needed. 5 stars to our busboy!(he was a little older so maybe let's call him busman). The owner was there and was very attentive and really wanted to make sure that everyone was happy. I appreciate that very much. My friend's burger was missing a topping and within 2 minutes the owner had a new burger for her. Just awesome! My only advice to him would be to smile more. :) I've  been to DMK and Kuma's which both had excellent burgers but this place was cozier.
"Got the burger. Paid extra for the pretzel bun. The sandwich was completely ruined because the burger side of the bun was completely burned to black. Nothing like the taste of burned oil on a burned bun. When you charge premium prices, I, as a customer, expects a premium product. A $12 burger must be perfect, every single time.  Whoever put this sandwich together certainly noticed the burnt bun but simply didn't care. Didn't care about the customer, the product or the business. What else don't they care about? Food temps? Sanitation? Cleanliness? Product rotation? Won't be going back. Several other burger places that care. Including the corner diner at 1/3 of the price."
"I've had some really delicious burgers here. The ingredients they use are really the best and you can taste it. They get a lot of their meat and cheese from local farms. One of the owners even has his own farm and they have some great plans for using heritage breed meats. My favorite burger is just the simple rare grass-fed beef, which is luscious and almost silky, paired with a strong creamy blue cheese and seasoned with simple salt and pepper. The truffle mayo is also really really good.I know this is a new restaurant, but the reason I'm not giving five stars is that things are still a bit inconsistant. I always order my meat rare and it only comes out rare sometimes here. Seating is also a little tight and uncomfortable too."
Love this place! The burger was delicious and the service was great! They have a truffle mayo that is amazing! I only did 4 stars just because i didnt like the smoke through out the sitting area.
"This place is fantastic. We frequently walk down Armitage, so it was inevitable that we'd eventually stop in and give it a try. The menu is fairly simple, mainly made up of the ways that you can customize your burger. My favorite is the burger with the Chicago spice mix (you can customize your spice rub!). I have also had their breakfast sandwiches, which are delicious, but the burgers are really what you need to be trying here. The fries are fantastic, and definitely get an order of beignets for the table. I would like to go back soon and try their custard!"
"Best.  Burgers.  Ever.Open only a week or so, and my friends and I have already been there twice and have tried the regular and grass-fed beef burgers, elk burger, shrimp burger and turkey burger, each burger better than the next, and each burger cooked exactly as we ordered it.  Delicious!  And I woke up for days afterward craving the Kennebec potato fries, and I am not normally a fries person (I am told that they have much more food value than a traditional potato, which is a plus).For those yelpers complaining about the cooking time, shut up and go eat the McDonald's or 5 Guys that you deserve.  With each burger customized as to protein, seasoning, amount of done-ness, toppings and bun, there is no way anyone can do that in 2 minutes or less - this is not fast food, it is casual food done very well.  And definitely worth the wait.  I agree that the ordering system needs to have the kinks worked out, and it seems like the owners know this as well and are working on it.  That should certainly shorten the wait times.  And since the whole restaurant is Mac-based, maybe an iPhone pre-ordering app is in their future.Another plus - in addition to the old-style decor being warm and welcoming, it appears that everything non-food in the restaurant is made from recycled materials and/or biodegradable, including the plastic containers the salads and salad dressings are served in.  I can't wait to go back, and look forward to the butcher part opening."
"I came here for the first time a couple months ago and raved about how great the burgers were one of the best in Chicago. I went back a few days ago and my experience was very different. first or table was dirty and no one seemed to care. second I ordered a grass fed burger medium rare. it was well done. the fries were over cooked to cremation. service was ok. what really bothered me is there were 2 other tables and going on 8:30. they close at 9:00. they turned the ac on to get us out. we all looked around thinking it was the front door open. I understand  wanting to get people out at the end of the night, but your not even closed and  people are atill eating. and  the ac... Really? I wont be back."
"Was craving a burger so came here with a coworker after the day was done.We had actually just gone to Grange Hall Burger Bar the week before, and this place just blew it out of the water. I had a rare grass fed beef burger on pretzel bun with all the toppings but no condiments. The juicy meat was absolutely what I was looking for - compared to the overcooked burger at Grange. You must get the fries. Perfectly crispy on the outside. Pillowy soft potato on the inside. The seating situation isn't ideal, but the service was top notch. The chef-owner was there helping service, and he took the time to chat up people waiting in line. As I understand it, he used to head up Duchamp over in Wicker Park, and I was a big fan of that place as well. Very friendly guy, and I hope the place does well."
"Butcher & The Burger is a fantastic addition to the neighborhood, which now offers Johnny Rocket's and Epic Burger as lesser burger alternatives. I had the house beef burger with french onion spice and fries. The burger was so tender, almost disgustingly tender, and the spice was just right. It was a very good burger. The fries are standard. You will leave slightly overcharged and stinky, but your taste buds will be satisfied."
"Butcher and the burger, if you had a soul I would ask God to bless it. My goodness are their burgers good, I had the all-American simply because I was too lazy to tell them the toppings I wanted, it was perfect! The hubster got the bison burger medium-well on pretzel bun topped w/mozzarella, BBQ sauce, mayo and their incredible bacon and we shared some fries. It was a perfect lunch :)"
"I am clearly too damn old for this place.It is hip, and happenin', and I was by far one of the oldest people in the place.  There are a small number of tables in the front of the restaurant.  And on the Friday night when we attended, they were all full to the gills.  (I ought not be using a fish reference in a beef place, eh?).I love the concept.  Make your own burger.  Choose your own bun (regular, pretzel, croissant, lettuce), your ""meat"" (mushroom, beef, elk, salmon, shrimp), toppings and seasonings... basically a build-it-yourself with high-quality ingredients.The burgers are delivered to your table on wood planks, and they are properly built, good-looking and taste good too.  Don't forget to order the Kennebec fries (one order will probably serve two people... lessn' you're really hungry, or greedy).  You can add a fried egg to your burger... g'wan, give it a try.Liked it... really wanted to love it... I wish I lived in the neighbourhood so I could carry-out for lunch.  The burger was good... but not ""ohmigod"" good, especially for $7.00 - $9.50 for a burger, and the fries (they ARE ""ohmigod"" good) are an extra $2.50... It's busy, it's elbow-to-elbow, it's loud and I guess I'm just old and crabby.  (Hey, can I order a crabby-patty?)"
"Hands down best fries I have had...ever. I have no idea how the salt and even the oil they cooked them in were so much better than other places, but they were perfection.  Burger was pretty much perfect too, would not change a thing about this place! I had the grass fed beef burger. It was so juicy, I practically choked on the juice (not a complaint!). Even though I am obviously not vegetarian, I can't wait to go back and try their version of a veggie burger. I am pretty confident it will be amazing too!"
"My first visit to Butcher & the burger. Juicy burger, Love the fries too! Someone next table was having a lettuce ""bun"" (i.e. using lettuce instead of bread to hold the patty). I am going to try that next time!"
"Butcher & The Burger is a great concept. It is the rare non-Thai spot in the general area that is BYOB. I brought a 6-pack of Brooklyn summer lager on a warm day, but I hear there is a liquor store nearby that gives you a Butcher & The Burger discount? Neat.I can't speak for the meat burgers because I stick to the lentil burger, but the basics like bun, condiments, toppings, fries are outstanding. Split a large fry with a friend- it's more than enough for 2 people. The lentil burger was really tasty with the onion soup seasoning. Pretzel bun was really firm and held it all together well. I love when a restaurant gets the veggie burger right (no Morningstar/Gardenburger/Boca patty, no falling-apart mess). The lentil burger had a good crisp to it, and didn't fall apart after the first bite. Super filling, too.Prices are reasonable for a more craft burger. I'm not a huge fan of picking my own toppings, bun, etc. because I find it really stressful and I don't always hit the mark, but they give good recommendations.Wear something light and/or sit by the door because it is piping hot in here."
"I think I'm tiring of boutique burger places, so I won't focus my attention here on their burgers, which, ultimately are very good, though the ordering process is unnecessarily overwhelming in its simplicity, and also pretty pricey. (Even if it is Lincoln Park, $35 for two for lunch still hurts.)What I will say is that their fries are hands down the best fries that I've had at a burger place (outside of the truffle fries at Rockit, which don't count as fries, but rather a religious experience).  An optimal blend of crunchy and soft, not greasy, not too salty - these fries were made with love.  And worth the extra price moreso than the burger was.But more than that, their chili will make me come back.  I don't think I can say enough good things about their chili.  A healthy burn at the end, but their spice blend favors flavor over heat, which is always a plus in my book.  I won't give away their secret ingredient, but if you know your spices it's pretty clear.  Regardless, it was a brilliant idea, and one that will keep me walking through their doors well through the winter.  Anyone can make a good burger if they try hard enough and have nice ingredients to work with.  Good chili is an art."
"Phenomenal burgers! I had the portobello, with goat cheese, tomato and avocado and it was really, really good. The goat cheese was clearly fresh and great quality. The fries were delicious, and my powdered sugar beignet was divine! If my rating was based on food alone, this place would easily gain five stars.The only drawback of the place is that it is small and cramped, and it was quite busy. It was difficult to get a table and we ended up sitting on uncomfortable bar stools. The ordering system is also a tad inefficient.Still, great burgers. Worth a bit of discomfort."
"I read about Butcher and the Burger from Mens Health magazine.  They said that Butcher and the Burger was the manliest burger joint so I figured next time I am in Chicago I have to try it.  The place was cozy and inside smelled wonderful.  The owner was going around making sure everyone was doing ok and asked if they needed anything.  He explained the menu to me and after thinking about it for a while i decided that the best option was to purchase the All American which is a standard burger (pickles, onion, beef steak tomato, lettuce, mustard, ketchup, american cheese, on a split roll) with fries.  I had to try it in the purist American form.  I also ordered some fries and got a tea.  The burger comes out on a wood block which looks like a small cutting board and the fries are made fresh.  The burger was fantastic probably the best I have ever had.  There is no wrong way to build your burger there as they allow for a lot of customizations and seasonings.   I opted for the classic though because the seasoning was just salt and pepper; but there are a lot of other options.  The service was just as awesome as the burgers were and I would recommend it to anyone that is in the Chicago area who likes a fantastic burger.  It is in the Lincoln Park area. The place also allows you to bring your own beer or wine whatever you prefer which is a plus."
"Last week, my boyfriend and I were craving a burger and walked over to DMK in my neighborhood. Unfortunately, they were randomly closed that day and we were really bummed. Turns out to have been a blessing in disguise because we chose to try Butcher & The Burger instead. This place SERIOUSLY lived up to the hype. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned burger with a side of incredible fries and truffle mayo. I can't stop thinking about it. Not to mention, it's BYOB with a great beer shop down the street [where you get a 10% discount if you mention B&TB].We'll be back for sure!"
"GREAT JOINT FOR A BURGER!  I loved this place, and will be going back for more.  The burgers are cooked perfectly.  The fries were very good as well, but focus on the burger first.  As others have written, you get to pick the type of burger you want, right down to the type of meat.  I had the house blend, and I selected the Chicago steakhouse seasoning.  I added carmelized onions, cheddar cheese and bacon.  The flavor of the burger was sensational!  It was cooked exactly the way I wanted, and it was just incredibly delicious!  I don't know what else I can say.... I loved it!  Words of advise:1.  Go on an ""off"" hour.  I went there at 1pm on Saturday, and it was still crowded.  By 1:30, there were some tables available and no wait for ordering.2.  Bring your own drinks with you.  Grab a can of soda or water before you arrive.  Drinks are rather expensive.3.  Enjoy the atmosphere. It's small.  So what.  You want a lot of room, go to McDonalds!"
"Butcher & The Burger is delicious! My boyfriend and I stopped by for a burger and we both had the beef burger with the steakhouse spice -- a kick in every bite! We had our burgers on a croissant, which made it even better! So delicious!We didn't get to try their beignets, so I look forward to stopping by again to try those. We also didn't take advantage of BYOB, but it's definitely a must in the future.Employees were attentive and friendly, and loved the atmosphere!"
"This is my first visit and the only reason I took a star off of the rating is because of how the place manages its seating.The beef burgers are excellent. I had the house blend and my boyfriend had the grass-fed. We both enjoyed our burger. We went on a Friday night so it was pretty crowded but the food was quick, and plus it's BYOB!However, the seat is ""first come first serve"" or what that means is, you are on your own (with some luck) to find seats. If you come on a good night where it's not so crowded, this wouldn't be a problem. On Friday night, the line is almost out the door and you have people who hasn't even ordered grab seats. Note here is, the food turns around really fast and I think it is not a type of place where people sit and chat forever after they are done eating unless they want to be smoked for the whole night (in door open kitchen, after a while the place is pretty much filled with smoke. Not in a bad way tho...) I wish they'll try to manage this somehow. This was a major turn off for me because we found out after we already ordered. I would definitely go back but I won't risk going on a busy night ever again because the seating thing (combine with some really cranky girl I met that night) partially ruined my appetite.Oh and I got a yelp deal for a free beignet! However...since it came with the burger, it got a bit cold by the time I got to it....Please please do something about the seating!!!!"
"I had the grass fed burger with cheddar cheese and the ""simple"" seasoning - sea salt and pepper.  Apparently they don't know the meaning of the word simple because they definitely over did it with the salt and pepper.  The first few bites were okay, but really after that it was inedible.  My husband had a burger with the Cajun seasoning and he wasn't too thrilled about his either.  The fries were pretty tasty but other than that it was not worth my time or money - close to 40 bucks for 2 burgers, one side of fries, and 2 Cokes!? I would rather go to Burger Bar, DMK, The Counter or any one of the other million burger places in the area before going back there."
"So burgers are well....almost always good.   It seems really hard to mess up a burger and this place was pretty much what I hoped.   Very good burger, great french fries and pretty high end prices.    I was most impressed with the service.   The girl that worked the counter was engaging, sweet and gave tons of great input and helped us score a table on a packed Saturday afternoon.    We tried salmon, grassfed, prime and pork.   All were good, none stood out more than another.   The truffle mayo does add a great flavor, get it on the side so you can dip your fries in it too."
"Dined in at ~8pm on a Wednesday; atmosphere was lively but not sardine can crowded. My dad and I placed our orders at the counter and grabbed a table. It seems like they are going with medium-rare as their default temperature, because they asked us both if medium rare was ok.... we both requested medium. About a 20 min wait for our food, so not too bad. Burgers were both cooked medium well, which was a slight disappointment.... however, they were seriously tasty. I opted for the Chicago Steakhouse Seasonsing on their natural house blend beef, and even at medium well this was a reaaallllllyyyyy good burger. I am anxious to give this place a little more time to learn their grill a little better and try it again. Pretzel bun was perfect for my burger, but I may try their regular bun next time because I'm not convinced the pretzel bun is worth the upcharge. Fries were delicious and almost perfectly cooked, but a bit salty. I am well aware of the fact that I have a bit of a salty pallete; so I feel like these fries may have been a lot salty to anyone else. 2 burgers, 2 fries, 2 root beers was $31.... so pricey-ish but to be expected in LP. I would easily be willing to upgrade Burger & the Butcher to 4 stars if they can get their burgers cooked to the right temp.... I'll pay $10+ for a burger with a smile on my face, but it had better be good!"
After ordering on grub hub the wait for delivery showed over an hour. The delivery came. The fries were cold and medium well was ordered but medium rare (at best) came. Everything else was just average.
"If you really want a good place to sit and eat a burger, there are better places in Chicago.  (DMK, Burger Bar, and Villians in the south loop all immediately come to mind.)  Does it REALLY make the burger better that they handcraft each patty to order?  Spoiler alert:  no it does not.  There are other places where I can get a table, sit down, and relax, and still get a burger that is just as good.  My main complaint was the ventilation in the place.  They have serious issues.  I smelled like grill all day.  Which is fine when, you know, I've been hanging out by a barbeque drinking all day.  But I prefer that I not be choked by the smoke of the grill in a restaurant.The stools they have along the side are also very cute, but horribly uncomfortable.  Style over function, I'm afraid.That being said, the burgers and fries are all very good, so I can't give it too low a rating.  I always love truffle aioli on a burger, but truffles are just magic and putting truffle aioli on a burger necessarily makes the burger delicious--it doesn't take a master chef to come up with that combo.  But there are a TON of places in Chicago with really good burgers where the dining experience is more comfortable.  And while I'm not usually one to discuss cost on yelp because I HATE it when people knock a place just because it's expensive, you should get what you pay for, and this is one of the most expensive burgers I've ever had, but not among the best burgers I've had.  If I do choose to eat from here again, I'll stick to calling ahead and carrying out.Oh, yeah... and once when I came, they ran out of silverware.  Yup.  Seriously."
Phenomenal burger place in a great neighborhood. You can choose between a variety of different patties seasoned with a wide variety of dry rub marinades and tons of great toppings. I would personally recommend the bison burger here. The fries are also amazing. The restaurant doesn't have a lot of seating so it's best to get here early. It is BYOB which is awesome too. Caution: ventilation in here isn't great so you will smell like meat and grills for the rest of the evening but in my opinion that is a really great smell.
We love this place - our first choice for burgers! Fries are also excellent - get one to share for the table. (And I love the truffle mayo...)
"I really like this place and I really liked my burger, fries and chocolate milkshake. The cashier was so friendly it made the experience so much better. The only thing I did not like was that the smell of smoke stayed on my clothes after eating inside where there was a lot of smoke coming from the kitchen."
"I love burgers. Let me get that out of the way.I was on the train after a Sunday afternoon at the Art Institute and remembered this place was no far from the Armitage brown line stop. My partner and I were hungry so I suggested this place as I'd been wanting to try it but am never in the area. I figured this place was small, so I hoped that around 3pm on a Sunday would be a decent time to get a seat.The line wasn't bad and we placed our orders, though it seemed like they were having some trouble with the Ipad. It's a bit of a long process to order, but I liked that there were many options. I think I had the Chicago Steakhouse spice and I loved the pretzel bun. We got one order of fries to share. We found a seat and watched the line grow. Before long our burgers were brought out. Very very good. I remembered to check yelp and there was a special on the app to get a free beignet. They let me get it even though I had already ordered earlier. It was good, but I don't think I'd order it again.I would consider going back, but there's not much seating and it gets very crowded. Great burgers."
"Food is a 4, but I am dropping the rating due to the seat yourself setup as I am really not a fan of it and the space constraints.  I came as a party of 4 on a Friday night around 7:30 (prime dinner time, I know).  It is seat yourself, so we immediately started scouting out tables that would be clearing soon and picked one to hover near (what I hate about seat yourself).  While we waited, we were constantly in the way of people clearing tables or patrons moving around because there is no room for waiting.  After standing and studying the menu board for 15 minutes, we decided to put our orders in.  I ordered a bison burger with Creek Bottom Game mix on a pretzel bun.  Then we went back to waiting for a table to open up for us to be able to grab.  After a few more minutes (we probably waited 45-60 total) a group of girls cleared out and we swooped in.  Luckily the other people waiting were pretty respectful about waiting their turn for a table and since it is BYOB we were able to drink while we waited.When the food came, the burger was very tasty, but I don't know if it was worth the extra money to get bison as I didn't taste a difference, but pretzel buns are always worth it.  We got an order of fries for the table to share and they were really good.  The food comes served on a butcher block which is aesthetically pleasing and a unique touch, but not the most practical as items had a tendency to slide off of it.Overall the food was really good, but I would recommend only going on off-peak times."
"VERY good.  Great selection, great burgers, great addition to the neighborhood!  I do wish they'd add some ""recommendations"" though -- my one thing about having so many options (meat/bun/toppings/extras) is that I'll end up with some unholy monstrosity.  Went a bit on the conservative side, but had an amazing burger.  Fries were good too.  Loved it!One great thing is they do NOT overdo the condiments.  I was thinking BBQ sauce, but had nightmares of globs of sauce everywhere.  So I stuck with truffle mayo and ketchup, while my friend got BBQ.  Beautiful thing?  PERFECTLY sauced on both counts -- not too much, not too little.  So don't fear a burger dripping sauce everywhere.Decor is also fab.  Busy, so don't feel slighted if you're left at the counter -- it's worth it!I WILL say, though -- the vintage ""weigh yourself"" scale between the bathrooms?  Shady.  Especially after I gorged myself on that burger.  Shady as hell.  Maybe next time I'll get a salad. ;)Definitely check this spot out!EDIT: Five stars now, just because the owner is lolmazing.  I dig it; I really do."
Unfortunately the kitchen here is just too small to keep up. The last time I was there it was over 35 minutes from ordering to service and both my and my girlfriend's burgers were way overcooked. Plus they started using bread and butter pickles instead of dill chips. It's disappointing because there was so much potential. I've given up on this place.
"love this place. Get juicy feedlot meat or grass-fed, your choice. Tons of ways to build your burger and the people who work their are very helpful. Also, its BYOB so you don't even have to buy a drink, just spurge on your perfectly cooked burger. For this you can get a NORMAL sized burger for about a quarter the waiting time of kuma's.....maybe even less since some people wait over two hours."
"Had the house prime blend burger with the ghost pepper seasoning, traditional fixings on a split bun.  Blew me away.  Meat was juicy, tender, and just enough spice to keep it interesting.Looking forward to going back there to try something else.My only complaint is that its a bit pricey:$19 got me a burger, some fries, a small grilled cheese for my son and an iced tea.  The burger was 12 on its own."
"When I go out to eat, I enjoy a little spice in my food.  The cajun seasoning is just what  I was craving on this night.  I ordered a pork burger(very under utilized protein), with cajun seasoning, mozzarella cheese, griddled onions, bacon, and BBQ sauce on a split top bun.  Of course I had to get the fries.  Hand cut fries are always a plus in my book.  The little spice in the seasoning, with the BBQ sauce so delightful.  I always love any good piece of pork.  The pork was juicy and tasted extremely fresh.  I will be back.  This is also a very good place to go before you go out drinking."
"I haven't been to all the legendary Chicago Burger places, but I've been to a few (DMK, Edzo's, etc.). This place is better. If you are a meat connoisseur, come here. The menu is organized so you build your own burger. You get to choose your own meat (beef, grass fed beef, bison, shrimp, plus more), spices (can't go wrong with the Chicago Steakhouse, but there are plenty more), bun, standard toppings, cheeses, and more eccentric extra toppings (fried egg, etc.) They are very good at cooking your burger to how you have ordered it, i.e., medium rare is ALWAYS medium rare. The burgers aren't huge, but they aren't small either, and you will need plenty of napkins because they are perfectly juicy. Whenever I have gotten fries, the portions have been pretty generous. They have glass bottled sodas, like Coke from Mexico, which is pretty nice. Last time I went it was BYOB, and there is a 7-11 near by along with a liquor store where you can get a discount by mentioning that you are eating at the Butcher and the Burger. The interior is pretty interesting, too.The inside is crowded, but I have never had to wait for a seat.Finally, Armitage in Lincoln Park is one of the neater streets in Chicago. Sitting outside is never a bad option. I have seen some people on Yelp complain about the price, but every burger has been worth what I have paid.My only complaint is that I end up here a bit too much. It is a meat lover's paradise."
"i've onged to try Butcher and Burger, but it was just OK.it wasn't crowded, but the estabishment was very smoky, to the point where we had to eat outside because I didn't want to return to work, smelling like a campfire.My wife got a salmon burger. The counter person couldn't have been less helpful in helping her choose a spice blend and bun that goes with the burger; she decided on umami. I had the prime house blend cooked medium rare with steakhouse seasoning on a pretzel bun with cheddar, bacon, lettuce, and tomato. The beef was overcooked, the steakhouse seasoning was bland, the lettuce looked like diced up iceberg that would be better used for a salad, and the bun was too big for the tiny burger.Aside from some Benton's bacon and the hand-cut fries, Butcher and the Burger is not worth the hype. With so many great burger places in the city, I won't be back"
"I love the atmosphere in this place! They did such a nice job with the store! The interior keeps with the character of the building and neighborhood. It's totally a throwback an old school looking restaurant/butcher shop and I love it. The burgers here are excellent. So far I've only been there once but I was very impressed  by the freshness of the burger and fries. The burger was not greasy by any means and the fresh cut fries almost seemed healthy. Instead of soggy and heavy with grease they were golden, crisp and tasty. I will definitely come back because I am interested in trying some of the rather unusual seasonings they offer for the meat - should be interesting!"
"Was walking down Armitage and stopped into this spot. Hadn't heard of Butcher and The Burger prior to my visit so didn't know what to expect.    Cool place.  Has an old school comfortable feeling.   Brick walls, exposed canned food decor with numerous articles explaining the owners accomplishments and history.  Serving from what I saw a variety sustainable and locally grown menu.Menu:  Impressive Options-The menu is geared towards build your own burger concept but you can also order from the special favorites with fixed ingredients.  When looking at the menu there were so many choices ranging from typical All American Burger to a Shrimp Burger and everything in between including Bison, Pork, and an Asian Umami Burger.  As I said you can also build your own burger with several different cheeses, spice mixes, and even specialty toppings including foie gras, Smoked Bacon, sauteed mushrooms, grilled onions, etc...Because of all the choices I was a little overwhelmed so I asked the gentleman taking my order, ""If I have never been here before what should I try?   I also told him that I love trying new flavors if that helps.  He said to go with the All American Burger.  I said really?  Is it really that good?  He seemed convinced that this was the way to go, so, I went with it thinking this is going to be one of the best beef burgers I have ever had.Hamburger:  Ingredients-Burger came out in a timely fashion.  Looked great.  Came with american cheese, toppings piled high including lettuce, tomato, and bread and butter pickles (these are the sweet pickles if not familiar), ketchup and mustard.  Hamburger: FlavorThe meat quality was good and charred so it tasted like you cooked it on the grill out back.  Not a ton of seasoning from what I could taste so you got more of the true beef flavor.  The ingredients were crispy and fresh but a little too much lettuce for my taste.  Although lettuce doesn't have a lot of flavor it can minimize the flavor of the other ingredients so I ended up taking some of it off and it helped.  Bun was a split top bun.  Perfect bun.  A little more consistency than your everyday hamburger bun but not so chewy like a pretzel bun that your ingredients shoot out the back.  I like the bread and butter pickles to give it a little sweetness.  My grandfather use to make these homemade so I am biasedAll in all you can tell that the ingredients in this burger are quality but I wasn't like Wow! that is one of the best burgers I have ever had.  I personally like a little more seasoned and savory burger but it was definitely good. Bavarian Potato Salad:This stuff is money.  My Grandma called it German Potato salad when I was young.  Loved Grandma's but this is better.  Bavarian potato salad is a vinegar based potato salad instead of a mayonnaise based.  Great side but a little pricey.  It was like $3.50 for a little cup.  Definitely recommend it either way.Bottom line: I won't travel from the South Loop to come here but when I am in this neighborhood I will definitely eat here again.  I am intrigued by the other options and I wish I would have gone with one of the more unique burgers they offered.  My fault for not making my own choices."
"Tasty burgers!Truffle mayo was great!!Pricey, just like their fellow ""upscale"" burger joints. I'd go back, but it's certainly not cheap."
"Man, I wish we would have found this place sooner. We found it on a whim. My husband googled restaurants nearby while we were sitting at Argo Tea on Sheffield and Armitage and this place popped up. Boy are we glad it did. We are both vegetarians and I have to say this place has the best vegan burger and vegan fries around, and we've tried a lot of places. The spice and topping choices are amazing additions to the already great burger and bun choices. We stopped in around 4:30 pm and the place was a buzz but not yet swamped with the dinner crowd. The owner helped us through the menu and thoroughly explained what was in each item so we knew what we could eat and what we couldn't. We both ordered the vegan burger seasoned with salt and pepper, with cheddar cheese, lettuce, truffle aoli and my husband added avocado to his and we ordered a side of vegan fries. The truffle aoli is to die for and is well worth the $1.00 extra. The fries were delicious and perfectly seasoned.We will definitely be back and we will be bringing other vegetarian guests with us.This has definitely made our list of favorite restaurants!"
The burgers are tasty but the fries are worth the trip!
"We drove a LONG way through a pretty bad rainstorm to go to this place, and it was completely worth it. We wanted to go to one of those neighborhood places you can only find in the city, but are painfully missing in the suburbs. This was it! A cute little place nestled in Lincoln Park, you're best to go off hours because they can get very busy with a line out the door.The hamburger selection is amazing - if you can imagine it, I'm sure they have it. Everything is super-fresh, and made to order. My burger was so good - with bleu cheese and onions (my favorite!) and my husband, who got the habenero jack cheese on his, was talking about it all the way home.  The fries, too, were perfect and homemade.As if the burgers weren't amazing enough, it doesn't stop there - the custard was out of this world. I HIGHLY recommend the vanilla, which was the best I have ever had. Seriously, I'll never look at ice cream the same way again. I am spoiled forever. If there were six stars to give, I would, but alas I am stuck with five.Nice job, B&tB. Great place, great, hardworking staff, and amazing food."
"We sampled their food at Burger fest and then we ate there.  Their burger fest burger was so-so but after eating there I can say with confidence that it is the Best Burger place I have been to so far since we moved to Chicago(better than Kuma's and DMK and any other I can remember).  My wife is an excellent cook and makes excellent gourmet burgers all the time, and this burger was as good or better than anything she has ever made and that's saying something. IIRC I got the grass fed patty with simple spices, split top bun, and cheddar cheese. Experience was amplified by a beautiful evening sitting out on their patio with my cutting board and steak knife."
"I've been here a few times since this has opened, I work in the area. They offer a wide variety and endless combinations of burgers. They offer many different types of meat and spice blends to go with the meats. The have a variety of cheeses and buns. I had the ghost pepper with the house blended beef on a regular bun. It was fantastic. The fries are pretty good too. I will go back and try some of their other meats and blends."
Dumb. Gimmicky. Trying too hard to be something it's not.  Overpriced average burger.  Staff wasn't very knowledgeable about the menu and the cooks were goofing off during my visit on a mid-afternoon weekday.   What's with all the marble tile? And merch? at a small burger joint? Get rid of the t-shirts and focus on the food. Don't expect this place to be around very long.
"Really good burger. I have been wanting to come to this place after hearing about it at one of the Chicago food blogs and finally got a chance to check it out with a friend. Its located in a corner and its smaller than I realized it would be. They had maybe 4-5 tables and the rest is just counter space.  You just go up to the counter order your burger, spice mix, toppings and any extras you want along with a drink or side. Since its BYOB my dining partner brought some beer for us to drink along with the burgers. I got the house blend burger with the Chicago spice mix and typical toppings with Swiss cheese along with the house cut fries. I also got the spit top bun which was very good and went well with my choices. The hamburger was very tasty and the hand cut fries were great. They also have other choices like a turkey burger or Elk. I can see why this place would have a line but we went early enough and on a day were we avoided any lines. As far as the butcher portion they really didn't have much of a selection but the meat looked very fresh."
"Disappointing! After so many good reviews, I was expecting better.Fries are too hard on the outside and lack any kind of seasoning.  I got the All American burger, medium well on a pretzel bun, Like another reviewer below, it was cooked perfectly on the inside but burnt on the outside.  My husband got the same, we shared a large fries, got a coke and diet coke (bottle and can, so no free refills, boo) and a chocolate frozen custard for our 2 1/2 year old...$37 later (not including tip), just not impressed.  On top of that, we barely had time to stand up and put our coats on before our table was completely cleared.  Just seemed like we were being rushed to leave. Prolly wont be back...."
"In this increasingly competitive market of fancy and bespoke burgers, Butcher and The Burger truly stands out.  The burgers are absolutely top notch, the fries are a-MA-zing, and all of the burger toppings / accoutrements are fresh, delicious, and appropriately priced.  To me, what makes this food even more incredible, is the fact that I can bring it home as takeout, accidentally leave it sitting on a counter for 30 minutes, and then still have it taste like angels riding a unicorn to flavortown in my mouth.  The staff also seems much more friendly and knowledgeable than a typical burger joint, but despite this mastery of the burger, they don't look down on anyone with any sort of weird pretentious or hipster attitude.  A+'s all around!"
"My friends came here when it opened and had a pretty bad burger (the cube steak) , but the pictures of the food looked too good and they offer two vegan options, which is pretty cool (not all vegetarians like mushrooms), so I gave it a try.Went right before noon and despite two people taking orders, there was a line to the door.  I think it's great that one of the guys was taking his time, explaining the food, but not during a lunch rush.We ordered a lentil burger with umami seasoning, a turkey burger with salt and pepper seasoning and a grilled cheese for our daughter.  Even though we went over the sandwich twice, the cashier didn't put the order through.  The expeditor apologized and got us the sandwich at no additional cost.  I love it when restaurants admit when they make mistakes (and not charge you for it).The lentil burger was good, nice and hearty and not trying to be a beef burger.  The turkey burger was good, a bit on the sweet side.  And I kinda wish the pickles were dill pickles.  But decent.  And the best part....the fries were probably some of the best I've ever had in my time on this earth. They might be THE best.  And I love french fries.  I'd come back for the fries alone."
"Vegetarians I've got you covered: Lentil burger, add Umami seasoning, wasabi mayo, lettuce, tomato, on a whole wheat bun, and never, never, ever, ever, never, skip the fries - got it?!"
"I was here for a butchery class the other night.  This part was fantastic: a bunch of people stood around watching the owner, Al, carve up a pig.  He is quite knowledgeable and really good at his job, and I learned a tremendous amount.  The atmosphere was great, too: the class took place in the basement kitchen, and although the class was full we were not so packed in enough to prevent everyone from seeing or participating.  BYOB made it all the more fun, as did the class slowly bonding against the overly-handsy couple who kept saying stupider and stupider things about meat.  Yes, lady, prosciutto really can be that big.What's weird is that after two hours of staring at this beautiful pork, one is so hungry that all you think about is a pork chop, or tenderloin, or crackling, or even drinking down a cup of pork stock.  Instead, you march upstairs and receive . . . a perfectly mediocre burger.  It's not a bad burger, but it's honestly not that great either.  It was just sort of: meh.  Now, after class you're served the generic house burger, and I suspect that jazzing it up either with different meat, toppings, or some of the spices available would really have improved things, and I'm looking forward to heading back to try out another one.  I will just make sure I'm not dreaming of pork chops before I go."
"Butcher and the Burger is so far the best burger in Chicago. (But not the country: see Holeman and Finch in Atlanta for that.) Infinitely customizable, well cooked, great fries, oh and BYOB. Very much worth traveling around Chicago for."
Amazing burger and fantastic service.  The staff is really helpful and when I checked in on Yelp I got cute little beignets that they make in house. Will definitely go again!
"I don't know, I hate giving a bad review. Maybe it was slightly over-hyped?  I ordered a regular cheeseburger cooked medium.  My boyfriend ordered the same but with a fried egg. 2 orders of fries and 2 cokes.  Both burgers were well done, his was also missing the egg.  I didn't send mine back. They promptly took his back and after a short wait it resurfaced with the egg but without the fries. Had to wait again for that.  I wasn't thrilled.  My burger was ok but nothing mind blowing. $33 price tag for both which I thought was slightly more than normal for that type of average meal.  I really hate the open door, no ac thing too. I don't like sweating while eating."
"Just attended a class there this evening.  The chef did a tremendous job in showing us how to butcher a pig and offered numerous tips on cooking the various components.  It was a great experience and I learned alot.Post ""training,"" we got to experience the burgers; moist, cooked to a perfect MR with fries that were also cooked to perfection.  Crispy on the outside and cooked through on the inside.  I really like the concept of this place - custom seasonings, etc.  And, the chef/owner really cares about the quality of his product - from the source to the table.Love it."
"Eh. based on yelp's star descriptions, this place is definitely a ""meh, i've experienced better."" Got there at 6pm on a Friday. We ordered from the slightly confusing menu and luckily got a table right away, but i could see how the wait can become awkward for others.Here is how 2 stars plays out:Pros:- BYOB- fries were great and i'm always a fan of truffle mayo- my husband thought his burger was alright, even though it wasn't cooked properly (medium to medium-well, rather than medium rare). he went grass-fed, steakhouse seasoning, pretzel bun, goat cheese, grilled onionsCons: - it's been said before and i'll echo the thought: if you have ""burger"" in the name of your restaurant, shouldn't you know how to properly cook one? I ordered medium, it came out medium-well. my husband ordered medium-rare, it came out medium/medium well. busy, tiny space and maze of tables makes it not even worth going to the counter to say something.- My burger: ordered the grass-fed beef with Simple seasoning (just salt and pepper) with the usual toppings. Apparently, simple is another word for inedible. It looked delicious, but then i took a bite. So much salt. so much pepper. whole peppercorns. i forced down a few bites just so i didn't waste the whole meal. husband took one bite and asked how i was eating it. i should have sent it back, but by that point didn't feel like getting a new burger.- my eyes are still burning and i'll need to do laundry due to the smoke in this place from the open grill. Needs better ventilation. better burgers are available in chi-town. my heart will always belong to DMK."
"THE BEST BURGER I HAVE EVER HAD.  The wife and I went here for the first time this past friday.  We asked the cashier to put together a prime blend burger for myself and a shrimp burger for my wife.  He made some suggestions for both of our burgers, we told him what temp we wanted them cooked to, and the result was amazing.  On the particular day we where there they had lobster salad, which the wife had on her shrimp burger.  The black truffle mayo is like nothing I have ever had.  The imported smoked bacon that they use is the best, and gives the burger a slight smokey flavor.  Everything was so good that when we contemplated what to have for dinner two days later, we looked at each other and said, lets go to B&B.  OH and get a side of black truffle mayo for the fries, which are awesome also.  Sounds european, but it was recommended to us and was fantastic.  Im making myself hungry"
As this just opened this week I am just going to comment on food.    I imagine the service will speed up in time.     I ordered the cube steak burger on pretzel bun and fries and they were both top notch.    I love Five Guys fries but I thought these were even better.    They were lighter and very fresh.   I couldn't decide what spice to choose on the cube steak so I am looking forward to trying the various options in the future.This restaurant is BYOB as well
One of the best burgers in Chicago!  Fun atmosphere.
"Laughable. That is what my most recent trip to Butcher and the Burger was. To be fair, I had been here twice before and the food/service was excellent, however the most recent trip was absolutely ridiculous. I headed over on a Sunday with 3 friends around 7:00 for, what I'd hoped to be a nice, causual dinner.  Instead, I left without even eating. Here's what went down:There was a little bit of a line, but nothing I hadn't seen before and nothing the restaurant couldn't handle. My friends and I got in line and waited to place our order. There was one cashier taking orders and one man standing to the side with an ipad also taking orders. Two of my friends ordered with the man with the ipad and found a table (which they bussed themselves).  Next, it was my turn to order, but the man with the ipad disappeared. Oh well, I figured I'd order with the cashier then. However,  he took a phone order first.  The person on the phone ordered at least 5 burgers and the order took at least 15 minutes (Think, ""what kind of meat?"" ""how do you want that cooked?"" well, I prefer this combo, but can try this combo"" at least 5x over).Then, the man with the ipad reappeared and I got excited! But, he took the dude's order who was behind me in line. So, my fiance and I were completely skipped over.  I told the ipad man, ""we haven't ordered yet"" and he apoIogized for skipping us and said he'd be right back. Nope, he never returned.  Finally when the cashier was off the phone ( a good 20 minutes after my friends placed their orders), I told him that we would not be ordering anymore as our friends were already eating (well, one was. More on the other friend later). Also, standing at the counter for so long was very entertaining- not in a good way. I am not exaggerating when I say in the 20 minutes that I was standing there, I watched at least 6 burgers go back into the kitchen because they were made incorrectly, had the wrong toppings, or were just flat out bad. The lack of organization/efficiency in the kitchen was mind-blowing. No one looked to know what they were doing and it was pure chaos- again, this was kind of entertaining, but someone needs to be in control!So, I go to sit back with my friends after declining to order and watched my 1 friend eat her food and sit with my other friend while she waits for hers. So we waited, and waited, and waited...Finally, after about 40 minutes, we asked where her food was.  The man had no idea and said it was lost.  He said they would make her a new one and offerered her some custard for the convenience. Custard? She was too surprised/annoyed to say yes. Also, the burger wasnt lost. We know what happened to it. We watched another diner eat half of it before realizing this was not what she ordered and informed an employee who brought it back to the kitchen. That brings the count up to 7 burgers now that the kitchen messed up (or I guess lack of a system messed up). My friend did ultimately get her burger and she did get her money back, a definite plus.Sorry for the long story, B&B has a great product, but they are so disorganized. They need to take some advice from XOCO who has the same type of system, but down to a science. Dear B&B, Here is some words of wisdom:Do NOT have the main cashier take a large phone order with a line out the door and when there is a group of 4 eating and 2 have already ordered (perhaps another employee can do this)Do NOT have the man with the ipad randomly picking who to take orders fromDo NOT make your customers bus the tables (or make it clear that diners are to bus their own tables after they eat so new cutomers don't have to touch other people's greasy napkins, cutting boards, silverware, etc.)Finally, if a group of 4 go to get dinner, it makes sense that they actually want to eat together. If I had ordered a burger, it would have been a good 45 minutes between when my friend was DONE EATING and when my burger would have come. PLEASE FIX THESE KINKS b.c I so want to come back here for the food!"
Love the place. Simple menu.. great burgers and its BYOB. The fries are huge so I got a small order which we had to split.
"Love, love, love this place!  Delicious and worth the price!  Sadly this establishment is not ideal for large parties due to the very limited seating.  But it's still worth it!!"
"Menu is a little confusing on the first time, but I figured it out. The place is small and compact. Wasn't so sure on eating off of wooden cutting boards... kind of have a sanitation issue with that... anywho... Best FRIES hands down that I have had in a long time. Burger has to be my second favorite ever! Will definitely be coming back to try again. It is a little out of the way for me but recommend giving it a try!"
"This place isn't sure what it wants to be. For $17 for a burger and fries, it ought to be a restaurant with service- not the fast casual environment established by the counter service and tiny dining area. It's a BYOB, which is always a plus to me, but that ensures people are not just eating and going, like say, Hot Doug's or the like...where it's always busy but tables open up quickly. Instead, there's nowhere to sit, and no hostess - until my boyfriend and I tried to snag a table and were told by an employee that these other people, who hadn't even ordered yet (and we had) were there first and therefore would get the table. ?? The burger was good, which is why I give them 3 stars. I liked the char on the outside of the patty, and the idea of the menu is cool, although I think it's just too broad and overwhelming. Fries = awesome. But when you talk about Chicago and burgers, there is nothing about The Butcher & The Burger that's any better or different than DMK or Kuma's, and both those places are cheaper."
"The restaurant was a little confusing at first as it is set up like a butchery shop and you order and pay before you sit. Which is a cool concept but doesn't bode well for the customer. It leaves you with great food and nowhere to sit. However when I went we were able to grab a table and eat on the patio. The burger was hands down one of the best burgers I've had. I got the house blend beef with chicago steak seasoning, regular bun, fried egg, bacon and BBQ sauce. Awesome. Fries were alright could use more seasoning or dipping sauce options. And heads up it is a BYOB restaurant so you need to pick up your wine or six pack beforehand."
"This is my favorite place in Chicago for burgers. Reason number one is the quality of the meat. I can eat the meat alone and it is juicy (even well done) and their spice blends are delish. Reason two, great cole slaw and pickles! I have already gone 15 times since Spring and I will never get sick of building my own burger and the homemade fries."
"Are you kidding me comparing this place to Kumas , Lockdown , Square bar and all the other great burger bars in Chicago. Butcher & the Burger was Very small , uncooked and greasy. Two bites left it on the table and walked out the door. What a joke"
"Simple or with all the toppings, this place is great.As I sit down to write this review I recall the simple sign by the register saying something to the effect of: ""Dear bloggers, we've only been open four days and request that you hold off and reviewing us for week as we work out all the kinks."" I respect that request, but hey, it was one of the best burger experiences I've had...so please forgive my enthusiasm.Our visit was on Saturday evening around 7:30. Food: Whether you're looking for relatively simple burger or a burger with avocado, fried egg, and truffled mayo, you can get it here. My wife went all out, I went simple with just cheese and onions. From the quality of the meat to the delightful flavor combinations we were both fans. Oh, and don't forget the pretzel bun -- Delicious! In addition to our burgers we ordered sides of fries. Perfectly crisp and potatoee (yes I know that's not a word).Service: We walked up to the counter to place our orders, the staff was very pleasant and eager to please. We had a few questions and they quickly made suggestions. After getting my burger I was happy I heeded the suggestion to go with just the salt and pepper spicing to let the prime meat shine. Ambiance: It's a small place, but it has a lot of character -- old time scale, the scent of grilling meat in the air, etc.Alcohol: BYOB. We brought a few beers and they were kind enough to ask if they could put them in the cooler for us. All in all, a great visit. We'll definitely be back!"
"ok, so a friend has been bragigng about this place for awhile, so i went there for lunch yeaterday. the burger was very good, the fries were delicious and the atmosphere was also ggod. the only reason they are not getting 5 stars...price. if you want a killer burger and do not mind paying the price, you'l like this place"
"For being such a meat-centric place, Butcher and Burger has an awesome vegan burger!  The ordering process can be a little rough (especially when the line is out the door), but the counter people have always been friendly and patient for me.  The fries are the bomb, my boyfriend thinks they might be the best in the city. The atmosphere is nice, although and it can be smokey at times, but the food is good enough to keep me coming back!"
"In trying to come up with something catchy and smooth to write for this review there is nothing to say other than giving you the facts. The burgers are good. Really good. I kept it simple with a beef patty and simple seasoning on a split bun. The fries are good and serving it on cutting boards is nice and environmentally friendly. The place is chaos...I don't know if the newness of it will wear off, but going in even during the week is kind of crazy. It seemed like most of the people in there last week were rude and just not concious of their surroundings. 2 girls eating together took up two of the high top tables for themselves and their shopping bags while the place was packed. So along with our meal we got a free show of watching a bitch fest take place over someone else wanting them to move. I get it--not the restaurant's fault...but it kinda is. If you are gonna have very limited seating then you gotta make the food faster so the people can get out faster. Overall, I would go back, just not when it would be busy."
"Gives the burger bar a run for their money. Artisan burgers that are well crafted and delicately cooked. BYOB, too. Quiet inside which is refreshing in Chicago."
Really great burgers and fries!! Plus the decor is so cute! Enjoy coming here Sundays with my girls!
"What to eat for lunch?  I always say hot dogs, a gourmet hot dog is ideal!  My wife says ummm how about something else, we have been to every hot dog place more than once.  But they are so good, i just cant turn my back on my old friend.  Enter butcher and burger, phenomenal!  just a few blocks from our house and work, only a few people in at 2:30 on a Thursday.  The choices tremendous, the atmosphere quaint and kitschy.  The service basic and to the point.  The burgers, awesome!  Sometimes when you bite into something so good, you can really taste and feel the texture of quality ingredients.  This is such a place!  burgers served on butcher block cutting boards, very good fries as well.  Put a fried egg on top and i am done.  So as we leave my wife turns and says to me ""so i guess burgers are the new hot dogs""  Yes dear, yes they are."
"I love that you can custom order your burger, from everything to a lettuce ""bun."" The quality of meat is pretty decent and they serve you up a nice, juicy burger! I also love that it comes on a little butcher cutting block. Very clever! And the fries and pretty yummy too! Maybe one day I will splurge and go for the foie gras burger!"
"I was wandering around Lincoln Park, just checking things out -I have been here three weeks but haven't been able to explore the city until I forced myself to take a stroll today- when I came across this place on the corner, near the Armitage train station. It's a pretty cool place. The name alone (and maybe the guy in the window eating a burger) got me in the door. After that, it was all them. The menu is the build-your-own-burger type and the staff was happy to make suggestions. Since it was my first time I went with the house blend beef, Chicago steakhouse seasoning and cheddar on a split top egg butter bun w/the usual burger toppings. I even tried the fries. I probably wouldn't have ordered the fries if they didn't have truffle mayo. But they did. And it was good. I was even impressed by the fries (which I normally am pretty ""meh"" about, in general). Just the right size, perfectly fried, maybe a touch too much salt, but very good.On to the burger. When I asked the girl taking my order if their medium rare was a ""real medium rare,"" she looked at me a little funny, but the chef stopped me while I was wandering around checking things out and told me he liked my question. He agreed with me that many places cook medium rare more like medium these days. Great minds think alike. Needless to say, the burger was perfectly cooked and very tasty/juicy/beefy/enter superlative here. Top-notch toppings (even the pickles were kick-ass) finished off the burger for quite possibly my favorite burger meal ever!I'm glad I found this place. I didn't even use the check-in offer. I figure it will force me to return, even though I was planning to anyway. Besides, that foie gras on the menu is calling my name."
"Piers Morgan once asked Anthony Bourdain what is American cuisine known for and what would be the one thing he would cook for a visitor that is very distinctly American. Anthony Bourdain, without wasting anytime, said ""I would make him a delicious ham burger"".  And delicious ham burgers are what you get at the ""Butcher and the Burger."" Not frozen, not reheated, not engineered so that you can pick up in a drive through, but simply made-to-order juicy hamburgers that make you appreciate the power of simple ingredients and good seasoning. I've had ham burgers at In and Out, Five Guys, Smash Burger, etc. but nothing came close to the grass fed ham burger I ordered at this place with basic toppings and the recommend house seasoning. Every bite was as juicy and flavorful as one would expect a good hamburger to be. So next time you're in town, do the iconic ham burger a favor and head to the ""Butcher and the Burger""."
"This place has been on my ""restaurants to try"" list for a couple of months now, and I made it tonight for dinner. I have no idea what took so long, but I'm glad I finally came.The experience started off on a bad note -  I awkwardly stood in front of the counter for around 3 minutes ready to order, while the staff paid me no attention. However, this was only a minor annoyance, and I am definitely no stranger to awkwardness, so this was okay by me. I ordered the house prime with cheddar, a fried egg, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and onion, on a pretzel roll, with fries. The order took around 15 minutes, which in my opinion is appropriate for a made-to-order hamburger. I definitely had some gripes - the pretzel was not as soft as it should have been, the lettuce was meager iceberg, and the pickles were a touch too sweet. However, when I get a burger, my number 1 concern is the meat itself, which in this case was spectacular: a sizeable, appropriately juicy and beefy patty, cooked to a perfect medium rare. So many burger places (*cough* DMK *cough*) mask pedestrian, puck-ish patties with loads of gourmet toppings and sauces - my friends, this is not the point. When I order a hamburger, I want a f***ing hamburger, and this place understands that! As an added bonus, the fried egg was just right - soft white, runny yolk, like heaven. The fries were cut rustically (clearly by hand), fried to perfection, and served with very coarse salt. I've had better, but these were definitely very good. Pricing was slightly steep ($14 for a burger with several charge-carrying extras, and fries), but by no means outlandish for a hamburger like this. All in all, Butcher & The Burger definitely understands the desires of a true burger connoisseur. It's not about trying to design a hamburger as Willy Wonka would, topping the patty whimsically beyond recognition -  it's about getting the burger right first and asking questions later. For sticking to that, I give B&B serious props."
"Went there yesterday to see what all the hype was about.  It's good, but way overpriced.   Two adult burgers and fries, 2 kids burgers and fries and drinks was almost 60 bucks.  Burgers were good, especially the spices.  Medium rare came out more like rare, probably b/c the spices char the outside.   Fries were great!  Average overall for the price."
"Great burger, helpful service, ideal location and BYOB....... What more do I need to say?"
"This place just opened up, replacing a useless store before it.  Much closer than Kumas or DMK.  The burger was good and I am glad it wasn't busy when we stopped in this weekend.  I wasn't in an adventurous mood so I'll save more interesting choice for next time.  I am also looking forward to trying the breakfast menu."
"Alert: let me just say this before I start - I love FIVE GUYS.  I have been to M Burger, Epic Burger, Counter, Burger Bar...... but I always end up at Five Guys.  The other places always disappoint me with high prices for dressing up the burgers as if they are going to a bad prom.  So I arrive at this place skeptical.  I get REALLY pissed off when I have to overpay for my food, I mean, reeeeally pissed off.  Anyway, I look at the menu and I start to get a little excited.  Shrimp burger?  I haven't seen that around ever since I moved out of Korea.  Working my way down the menu, I'm liking the spice options, all the fixin's and extras...slightly sad that there isn't jalapeno to put in my burger but it's ok, move on.  Only bottled sodas for $3?  pushin' it.I get my burger.  Just by looking at it, it needs greener lettuce and they need to work on slicing those onions in half, but then I am not here for salad so move on.  I bite into it.....and not bad.....not bad at all.  The ghost pepper spice and meat make a good flavor with the amount of heat that I like.  The steak fries are crispy and nice.  Cafe con leche and frozen custard for dessert.  Very good.I will be back to try that shrimp burger :)"
"Very solid Build-Your-Own burger joint with relatively simple, high quality ingredients. Some interesting burger choices for those looking for something other than beef. I had the grass-fed beef and found the patty adequately sized, seasoned and juicy. Somewhat thick but not too thick. Pretty basic choices of cheese, toppings and dressings - I went for the truffle mayo, a $1 upgrade, which was totally worth it. The fries are quite good, rustic and flavorful. The milkshake is good but nothing special, and overpriced for the size. Food is served on a small cutting board, which is a nice little touch. Doesn't seem like you ever have to wait very long at this counter-service place, either, which means I'll probably be back in the future."
"We love this restaurant! The food is always good, and the manager has always been present and friendly. Yes it's busy, yes they have like 6 tables, but somehow we always manage to get a seat. Plus they have Spreckers rootbeer!"
"I'm not sure how this place can go wrong with BYOB, build your own burgers and some incredible beignets. I recommend coming in earlier during the week as we grabbed the last free table before a huge rush. They are not rude about hanging out to finish drinks but once you notice that line you can't help but want to move on. I loved my burger and the options they had to dress it up. I wish I could have had fries at the time since watching someone else eat them was torture. Nice option on Armitage!"
"My friend and I went here yesterday for lunch and it was absolutely delicious. The man at the register was very friendly. He noticed that I was wearing a DePaul sweatshirt and notified me that I get 15% off for being a DePaul student! He also advised my friend on what kind of spices to get on her bison burger - advice that she was very happy that she took. I got a regular beef burger (medium) with swiss cheese and the Chicago spices. It was positively divine....possibly even in the top 3 burgers that I've ever had. My friend got the bison burger with swiss cheese and was a little bit nervous because she didn't realize that the bison burgers are much much more expensive than the regular ones. However, after she had one bite (and let me steal a bite) she was totally fine paying the extra cash. Absolutely delicious! Good, friendly atmosphere too."
"Yes I'm just another reviewer who was ""so excited"" to try B&tB and has been wanting to go since ""before they even opened"". Add me to the list of Yelpers who spend way too much time researching options for their next meal.I don't actually choose to eat out much so when I do I have to have a good guarantee that I'll be satisfied. Unless it has the Yelp five-star seal of approval I won't even entertain the thought of trying something. Heck, I've even disregarded certain dentists based on this criteria.Hence the five-star review here. In full disclosure I'd normally go with four stars on this one but I'm determined to cancel out some of the negativity around here. It was that negativity that almost kept me from trying B&tB at all. Why I'll definitely go back:1. Service. We walked in at 6:30pm on a Thursday night and a gentleman greeted us, arranged together two tables for our party, tapped and served us our wine, and readily offered up suggestions for their numerous burger options.2. BYOB, as noted above. My ideal last meal would include a burger and wine (and also pancakes, ice cream, and two cookie cakes), so to be able to experience a small version of that dream (and on the cheap) is a huge win in my book.3. Quality. No, it wasn't the best burger of my life. Yes, the ingredients were delicious (I did turkey and cajun spice on whole wheat and tried a bite of the shrimp and umami on pretzel), the fries were satisfying, and overall I felt we got what we paid for. No mess-ups with our order.4. Ambiance. Despite that it's small, and yes, they still need to work on ventilation, it was comfortable and conducive for good eating and good conversation. In general I'd agree with most of the comments about this place (e.g. wait times are long, tables are scarce, etc.) but don't let that stop you from giving it a try."
"Been here twice now, today I think I've decided I likely won't go back. It was over $40 for 3 people and all the hamburgers patties were almost half the size of the bun. My hamburger was very under cooked and I had to send it back. The service is a little slow and the cost is just too high for what you get."
"Two burgers one drink and one fry-$28.00. I honestly prefer five guys. Overpriced! Burger was dwarfed by bun, and bacon was fatty. Good fry's."
Had the shrimp burger with the Asian spice. Amazing! Even had beignet for dessert.  Great food and service.  Check it out if you can. Byob.
"Great local place.  Matt was extremely helpful taking our order and making recommendations as it was our first time there and there are a lot of options (meat, sauce, bun, cheese, toppings, etc..).  I went with the salmon burger with the curry sauce and an order of fries- all excellent! They also have a nice selection of drinks and delicious custards.  It was a great place for lunch, dinner, snacks, dessert, etc..  I also love that they use real silverware, serve the burgers on small wood planks, and recycle!  I noticed they have belly and offer cooking/butcher classes- I definitely want to check those out!   To sum it up- amazing quality ingredients, excellent service, and great atmosphere!"
This is my favorite burger place in the city.  The different seasonings on the burgers make it different. I would recommend this place to anyone who has the time to stop by.
"It's a quality burger place with quality ingredients and the NICEST GM on the northside. Preston literally makes every eat in/out the best!! Thanks so much, I'll be a neighborhood regular."
"I really really wanted to like this place! So much so that I have tried it three different occasions. The first time, I did carry-out and there were a few things wrong: 1) the order was completely wrong 2) the burger was way too raw 3) there was so much seasoning on the burger I couldn't even eat it. This was pretty shortly after they opened so I figured they would get their act together after a couple of months. The second time, not much better of an experience. Got my order home and it was completely wrong...again. So finally, on my last and final visit I thought, maybe if I eat here instead of getting it to-go, that way they will fix anything that is wrong....I waited over an hour just for a single burger!! Now I am forced to walk by this place on a daily basis, smelling incredible, but knowing that I will have another bad experience. Totally sucks because the decor is awesome, great location by my house, and it smells oh so good."
Really good - only thing i've eaten here that I didn't like was the shrimp burger - change it to Salmon.  Big line
"My husband and I love this place! It's located right in the heart of Lincoln Park.  The food is SO good!!  All it comes down to for us is 1. Great food. Great Burgers (many choices of meat, toppings, spices, etc) 2. Great atmosphere 3. BYOB!!  Such a great spot for a low key date night! The ONLY thing about this place is, the dining area is small, so sometimes it is hard to find seating! Other than that....it's my favorite burger spot!"
