CRĪO Bar and Restaurant
"One of Chicago's hidden gems. Came for brunch around 1130, and it was surprisingly empty. Nice little spot with great music and excellent service. $15 bottomless mimosas.Steak Skillet was excellent. Will def will come back for this dish again. Also want to try the Egg Benedict.Nutella french toast was good, but nothing extraordinary about it. Just good 'ol french toast. But, thought there was a bit too much nutella on it. If you're looking for an easy, no wait, fun and delicious brunch spot for you and your group of friends... this is the spot!!! Plus 10% off when you check in."
"Huge heads up: Open table let us make a reservation with them for Sunday night dinner, but there hours are only brunch on the weekends. Watch out!"
"Crio is off the path for sure but, worth the commute! Cocktails are delish and the food was yummy. We got the Nutella french toast to start. The French toast itself was cooked perfectly but a tiny too much Nutella on top. I'd ask them to go light on the Nutella and maybe get some on the side. Then we got the eggs Benedict, the egg was cooked perfectly and the sauce was lovely. The pork needed a little more flavor. Then we got the steak skillet. Wow, this was so amazing. The flavor of the steak and the potatoes were to die for. (Potatoes come with the eggs Benedict as well) We also asked for hot sauce and they gave us a homemade hot sauce that was perfection. We would've bought it off them we liked it so much. I will return, and I'd order the steak all day. So good! I cannot wait to try their normal menu."
"I had a great experience at Crio. I had made reservations for 9 of us on a Wednesday night. When we got there, the place was pretty much empty. By the time we were finishing dinner, we were the only ones in there, which I didn't mind because we were celebrating the holidays and had a White Elephant exchange going. The food was good. It didn't knock me off my feet (I mean I was sitting) or anything but it's solid. We all shared appetizers (empanadas and loaded fries), the fries were the star of the night. I guess fries seem to be the star of any night with this group. They were topped with pulled pork, cheese and scallions. I ordered the tacos de pescado, which were ok. I don't know why I never get cocktails, they had a decent menu of them, but they also had a very nice beer menu too. For the amount of people and food we ordered, the service was good. The waitress split our bill per PERSON at the end with out us even asking. Impressive. Gold star for her.The atmosphere was great. The lights were dimmed, not too dark though and the music was nice and soft. The mural on the wall is gorgeous. This would be a place to have cocktails and appetizers in the summer. Just to wind down. I'd like to try the brunch too, it looks really good!"
"We came in as a group of 10 for a birthday. Cool art décor on the walls and dark atmosphere. Overall: 4.5 starsService: 5+ freaking stars. The service was great. I was actually very impressed at how it easy it was to get separate checks (and we didn't even ask initially). After telling the waitress, each check also included the splitting of the birthday girl's meal. ridiculously accommodating!  Food: 4 stars-the loaded fries is legit. this was without doubt loaded with cheese and shredded pork goodness. the fries are certainly the best...just the perfect crisp and taste and not soggy. -The steak frites was okay. the chimichurri sauce is awesome but the steak was bit chewy for medium done.-the chile relleno - this was recommended by the waitress and it was not a let down. I would get again. The sauce had a kick to it and very flavorful. They have a tempting selection of cocktails and drinks. it was hard to pick. I definitely like the vera mango over the mescal mule. the mescal was a bit smoky for me.Wish we had a place like this in Old Town"
"On a Saturday Brunch, this place felt like if Aaron Sanchez was directing ""Saw XIV"".  Suspiciously empty... and the plot twist was instead of death propositions... they make you choose between bangin' brunch dishes.  (Weird. Right? But I'd still watch.)So the GF and I were the only ones in here (surprisingly), and we proceeded to order. Alberto (partial owner) catered to our every need.  He even broke down how the restaurant started, and their efforts to separate themselves from the previous restaurant identity.  It was refreshing to hear such honesty and passion from management.  I felt like we were royalty, and he was trying to impress our every bite and moment.  It's hard being loved, sometimes...Here's a breakdown of what we ordered:::STEAK SKILLET::Skillets just seem to make life better...  Tender skirt steak cooked to order, nice peppery seasoning, on a bed of sauteed corn+onion+potato+bacon mixture.  Flavor was definitely bustin' out the seams of the skillet.  My only gripe was that toward the end of the dish some oil had accumulated making each of the last bites hate myself exponentially. ::PORK BELLY BENEDICT::The poached eggs had a nice runny yolk trickling down onto healthy slices of bacon, and warm biscuit.  The roasted red pepper hollandaise was mild with a nice smokiness that carried the dish.  Side potatoes were nice and garlicky, but I would have preferred some greens or something lighter in addition to everything to break up the outpouring of savory flavors.The Verdict: We'll be back, no wait for brunch food this good is a tough find in Chicago!"
"Cute place to find! Stopped on our way home to break up the drive and pleasantly surprised by the tasty brunch we had! Service was very good and everyone friendly. Food was tasty, fresh and creative! Definitely recommend!"
"We had reservations on a Saturday night for a party of 7. We got there and were seated immediately. The restaurant was pretty empty, as there were only 3 other parties there. I'm not sure why this is, since the food and the service here were pretty good.I started off w/ a hibiscus margarita. They really should drop the ""hibiscus"" in the name because I couldn't even tell there was any hibiscus in it at all! However, it was a pretty good tasting margarita. As for food, I had the steak frites. The steak was tender and the chimichurri sauce was awesome. The chimichurri sauce had lots of garlic - garlic lovers rejoice (or, if you're on a date, make sure to bring some mints for afterwards)! The fries were sorta soggy, but that didn't stop me from using them to soak up the rest of the chimichurri sauce. Our waitress was awesome. She was quick w/ our orders and even split our bill for us (major props for that). The food and service at Crio make it a great restaurant - you can't go wrong if you dine here!"
"We had a Groupon for dinner and drinks at Crio Bar and Restaurant. It was scrumptious delumptious! We were so happy!We were quickly greeted, seated, and served corn chowder topped with popcorn. We enjoyed empanadas, skirt steak, and chile relleno. The empanadas were alright, but I'll probably enjoy something else next time. What I did love was the skirt steak! Too bad it was M's entree and not mine. Fortunately, M loved my chile relleno more than I did. I guess that just goes to show that folks have different tastes!Service was great: timely, professional, and cheerful. The atmosphere was cool. There was neat artwork and a blackboard wall for people to write on. The prices were inexpensive! We could hardly believe that Crio was offering a Groupon because it's budget-friendly without it!Besides the distracting family with children sitting right by us (which is NOT the fault of Crio) the only drawback was that the temperature was so chilly! We kept our winter coats on the entire time."
"First time dining in today, made me feel @ home. So much character and flavor tucked away in the city, great atmosphere and food. Alberto was so nice and accommodating, recommended a few things on the menu, which were all great! Very new to the restaurant scene, genuine people, great food, great drinks! Great independent spot, check em out!"
"I came here with my gals dinner group--we had a group of 9 dining on a Wednesday night. It was kind of quiet and empty that night, so it really seemed like we had the whole place to ourselves. They have a nice craft beer and cocktail menu. Even though it was cold outside, the Hibiscus cocktail and later the sangria took that chill away. Both tasty and refreshing, the drinks complemented our food well. The group shared some apps, mains and sides and everyone seemed to enjoy their choices.  The loaded fries were clearly the winner (our group really loves fries), topped with pulled pork, melty cheddar and scallions, it truly is a flavorful dish.  I got to try a bit of the empanadas, which was OK, but like I said, the fries really stole the app show.I chose the Sopes de Panza, 2 cornmeal sopes, topped with cochinita pibil pork, carmelized red onions, black beans, queso fresco with a jicama and pineapple relish. The flavors were so fresh and the pork was very tender. The sopes were a bit dry and tough though--that was the only negative about the dish.I got to try a duck taco and it was good too. There were sides of chimichurri fries and mac and cheese passed around as well and both were huge servings.  The Mac N Cheese could have been a meal by itself.  The Mac N Cheese was made with andouille sausage and the cheese was a perfect melty creamy consistency. The chimichurri fries were a bit of a disappointment as I love chimichurri--they didn't have much of that flavor and were a little bland. Did we order dessert? I can't remember.  This was the last dinner of 2014 for our gals group and we just had an amazing time thanks to the wonderful staff at Crio."
"You could replace the sound of crickets, signaling the emptiness of a space, with Latin music, and then you'll have Crio.7:00 p.m. on a Wednesday, and Crio was quite empty.  Our group of 10 or so helped to fill the space.The Latin music, funky wall murals, and chalkboard wall give a welcome feeling.  It was a great setting for a girls' night out.Our group started with a few appetizers, and the loaded fries were the winner.  With beer cheese sauce and pulled pork topping the fries, you really can't miss!Like my friends, I also had the Hibiscus cocktail, which was similar to a margarita only a bit sweeter.  The sangria was just OK for me.  There are some unique beers on the menu as well, including a Brazilian beer that had a slight cola flavor to it.I had the Chile Relleno for my entree, and I'm sorry to say I was a little disappointed.  I expected more, but I was unfortunately surprised that I've had better chile relleno at the many cheesy Mexican-American casual dining outposts of the suburbs.  For the price, I would have preferred two chiles instead of one.  There wasn't as much cheese stuffed inside as I would have expected either.  It tasted good, but I expected better.Even though I'd had plenty of fries already, I couldn't resist ordering the Chimichurri fries.  Again, I was a little disappointed.  Think pico de gallo sprinkled over fries.  The portion was massive though, which seems to be their ""thing"" when it comes to sides.Ericka A. ordered a side of the macaroni & cheese, which was made with andouille sausage.  I'm not a fan of andouille, but the macaroni & cheese looked so creamy and cheesy, so I tried a spoonful.  It was very good, but again, I'm confused:  for a side dish, this portion was massive and could've been an entree.The service was great.  Although I was curious about a dessert menu that I never got to see, I was really impressed with our waitress when she did not hesitate to split our bills.  You've got to love that.Crio wasn't really hit or miss for me.  It was good, but I didn't walk away with the feeling that I need to come back again."
"The groupon for 2 included 2 drinks, 2 entrees, and an appetizer to share. My drink, the Hibiscus Paloma, was delicious. My friend liked her Bourbon drink as well. In fact, we liked our drinks so much, we ordered a second round. Necessary evils.For the appetizer, we chose empanadas. The crusts were flaky and the fillings were flavorful. Totally worthy. I wanted to try the ""American Burger,"" but in a Latin restaurant, I would never. So I went with something else, the chile relleno, which was delicious. A massive pepper filled with goodness and encrusted in an egg batter? What's not to love. As much as I love a big menu, I know that a small menu means that they're going to give you few options, but they are options that are going to be done well. And this place was no exception. My friend enjoyed her entree, the steak frites, as well, saying the homemade chimichurri sauce was excellent.The atmosphere is warm and inviting, with a sexy modern appeal. The service is cute and friendly. It was cold outside, like negative temperatures, but I was surprised the restaurant wasn't busier. I would certainly return to help fill up the space."
"I came here the other night with a wonderful group of ladies to celebrate the holidays and have some eats and drinks. First off, free and available parking outside. A definitely plus.For a Wednesday night, it was pretty quiet. We had a big group (and a reservation), so there were no problems there. They have a nice drink menu. I ordered the Hibiscus cocktail. It tasted a lot like a margarita - very good and strong for the price. I also tried the sangria which was good as well.We split the loaded fries and empanadas. Everything was great (especially the loaded fries...we got three orders. No judging). I ordered the duck tacos. Simple but very good. And filling (after apps and drinks). Also, the sides are like meals!! The mac and cheese was seriously amazing, and huge. Totally worth the money. The chimichurri fries were good, but I thought it was going to be more like a sauce. It was more like a dusting of spices on top.Service was great. Out waitress always had drinks on the table, the food came out in a timely manner, and plates were cleared. Also, not related to service, they have a sweet mural on the wall that I'm in love with.If you check in on the Yelp app, you get 10% off your bill as well."
"I had high hopes for this place, but it turned out to be a disappointing and embarrassing experience. There's nothing worse than having your restaurant suggestion turn out to be a bust.Everything started out pretty well. My husband and I had a drink at the bar while we waited for our two friends to arrive. Once they did, we waited for the bartender/manager? to stop chatting and offer us a drink or a table, but it didn't happen. So, I interrupted her and asked if we could be seated. Once seated, we were promptly brought water and had our drink orders taken. We then ordered appetizers, but our server soon returned to tell us they were out of scallops.  Bummer, but not the end of the world. The appetizers we had were quite good, mussels with chorizo sauce and the loaded fries. We laughed about how the loaded fries seemed odd on the otherwise pretty classy menu, but they were yummy. The mussels were great! Then we ordered our entrees. My husband and I both ordered the steak frites, but they were nice enough to substitute the fries for a vegetable since we had had fries as an appetizer.  We both ordered our steaks medium.  They arrived rare. Really rare. Like bleeding all over our plates rare. I took a bite anyway because I thought maybe it's the Chef's recommendation.  The center was cold, so it clearly had only been slightly seared and was definitely rare. My friend flagged down our server and I explained, in what I thought was the most polite way possible, that our steaks had turned out very rare while we had ordered them medium and asked if they could be cooked more. She said ""sure"" and then walked away.  She came back a minute later and asked me how I would like it cooked. I said ""medium, medium well"" when she cut me off and said ""Medium or medium well? those are completely different."" I was shocked.  My husband interjected ""well if you call this medium, then guess we need medium well or well"". It was tense and uncomfortable and there was no apology or acknowledgement of the mistake. The rest of the meal went ok. Our server returned to being polite, maybe realizing that she had come off like a total snot.  Then, when they brought us our check, we were told that their credit card machines were down and they could only accept cash. Really? You tell us now as we're on our way out? I didn't observe this message being shared with anyone else in the fairly crowded restaurant so I wondered if they were just pulling something. I will state that I had purchased the Groupon to come here. I also made a reservation and told them about the Groupon up front.  I still have this feeling that the Groupon may have been the reason they wanted the balance in cash. Who knows. I do know that we won't be returning."
Service is excellent and food is superb! weather you go here for brunch or dinner the food is amazing. Grass fed beef is a plus.
"I came to Crio last night with my friend. I had a Groupon that was expiring and it was my last day to use it!The restaurant was entirely empty when we got there. Granted it was a Wednesday night, cold, and there was still plenty of snow on the ground but it seemed a bit strange that we were the only ones there. We remained alone throughout our entire meal.This is what we ordered:-Scallops: This one was pretty good. It was absolutely tiny though and if I had actually payed $14 for 3 teeny tiny little scallops I would not have been very happy.-Steak Frites: The steak was cooked perfectly to my medium rare! I also loved the chimichurri sauce that came with it. However, it was a bit chewy. I also did not think that the fries were that great.-Torta de Carne: This is a braised oxtail sandwich. I thought that the meat was very flavorful and tender but I did not really like the cinnamon. I feel like they should warn people that there is cinnamon in the description!I spent a lot of time trying to decide whether I should give this place 3 or 4 stars. I felt like the food was pretty decent but I definitely was not blown away by it and neither is it a place that I see myself wanting to return to. It was also really really cold in there!"
The price was a steal. The drinks were excellent. The food was very good and the service was fantastic. We will definitely be coming back and so should you. We arrived about 40 minutes before closing (wasn't aware). Lost track of time and we stayed 40 minutes after closing (sorry). Didn't notice since there were so many other customers still in the place. Staff never pressured us to leave or hinted the place was closed. Can't wait to come back and try other menu items.
"We came here with a group to celebrate a friend's birthday. They did a great job accommodating us. They even split our checks at the end without being asked. The drinks were good. Many at the table had the vero mango. A couple had the hibiscus margarita. The mango drink was soo good. I want to go back just for that drink. The food was pretty good too. We had a couple orders of the loaded fries for the table. I'm not a big fries person, but I admit these were quite delicious. Everyone seemed happy with their choices for entrees. It was an enjoyable meal with good company. The decor is fun. The only downfall is there isn't much else around the restaurant."
"Amazing Customer service, amazing food.went in  on the 23rd and had a reservation for 8, we stood for almost 2 1/2 hours.EXCELLENT hosts there.Everyone really enjoyed their food.I will definitely be back.Only thing. I wish the music was a bit louder for more atmosphere."
"Whether it be for brunch or dinner...I highly suggest this establishment. I'm dreading the day this becomes a thing, because I really love knowing I'll get a table here without much of a wait. The staff is very friendly and the nightly specials are fantastic! 1/2 off sangria on Fridays?! It was a dream come true. The fish tacos are absolutely beautiful to look at and even tastier to eat. The chilaquiles are wonderful! Just go here and eat everything!"
"The food was amazing! The owner/manager was great. Extremely nice. No paid parking on the street and they also have off the street parking. Our waitress wasn't the best. She wasn't very attentive, she seemed preoccupied behind the bar area which became irritating. We had the steak skillet and the meat omelette. They both were amazing. I subbed spinach in for the cactus lol. The portion sizes seemed small at first glance but they are really justified for the prices. The OJ is delicious. Bottomless mimosas for $15 per person is great! I definitely will be back."
"Surprisingly this place was almost empty on a Saturday night, which was just fine for our group of 7. We were seated immediately, given water, and placed some drink and appetizer orders. The hibiscus margaritas were good, but just tasted like regular margaritas. The Paloma was great and so was the mojito! For food... You can't go wrong with the mussels as an appetizer. Pretty good size pot of piping hot, large mussels with chorizo. My friend must have liked his empanadas because he didn't share! The duck tacos were tasty although the duck meat itself was a little dry. The guacamole and salsa that was served with the tacos helped out with that. The carne asada torta was great although the meat was a little chewy. French fries were kinda mushy but by that time we were full so it's okay. Everybody liked their food and the service was spot on the entire time. The waitress even split up the check for us. 10% off your bill if you check in!"
"AWESOME, AWESOME little find.  I came here on a whim, quickly yelp'd restaurants in this area that were inexpensive.  The service was superb- looks like a family-owned joint and everybody was very attentive, informative, and accommodating.  There is a lot of space inside with modern decorations and cool little light installations.  Definitely an intimate yet neighborhood vibe good for a date or a nice dinner with a friend.  I had a tecate Michelada which they were happy to make for me even though it wasn't on the menu, a hibiscus margarita (I'm a marg snob and this was GOOD- not too sweet, refreshing, just enough alcohol), split the loaded fries app (O.M.G. I'm not kidding, the bomb), and had 2 of the taco special- steak, carmelized onions, big chunk of chihuahua cheese, and their special mole sauce (sweet but good kick!).  I have zero complaints about this place- it is affordable, locally owned, unique, and fun."
"Just stopped in here recently for dinner.  The decor of the place is great.  For those who are just stopping in by themselves, you have a bar on one side.  And if you are looking for more room and a little more intimate setting, it's a restaurant on the other side.I ordered the Chile Relleno.  Very, very good.  It tasted a lot like Egg Foo Yung with bits of short ribs inside.  My only complaint about it was the short ribs were unevenly spread out.  At first I could barely taste it but by the time I was towards the end, it was pack with it.  But the sauce was amazing.  They also have great weekly specials.  Mine that day was sangria pitchers so needless to say, I ordered a beer.  Definitely want to come back again and check out their burgers."
"Amazing Father's Day Brunch!  Couldn't ask for better food, drinks or service!  I will definitely be back... Even though it is a 40 minute drive to get there!!"
"So I'm currently at the bar just waiting to be seated as other people get seated before us. They don't have a proper host table or way to keep track of anything. The food looks amazing here, and I would love to eat here but damn?!? The service is horrific! I can't, I really can't..."
"Food was very. good, i had the steak skillet. meat was cooked well and the vegetables were fresh. My fiance loved the unlimited mimosas."
Went here for brunch and it was fabulous! Great atmosphere. Will definitely be back and am excited to tell my friends about this great find.
"My nephew and I checked this place out with a Groupon...what a great find! Nice family-run spot with excellent food and cool décor. They also have an interesting beer menu, heavy on some unusual Mexican and South American beers...not just your usual Tecates and Pacificos, here! We split the Loaded Fries as an appetizer, and the Steak Frites and Chorizo Burger as our entrees, with the plantains as a side. All of it was fabulously tasty, but the skirt steak deserves a special shout-out for the wonderful quality of the meat. Absolutely lovely! Also, ask for their house-made cayenne pepper hot sauce. Robust flavor and just the right amount of heat. Thanks to the owner Magdalena and her daughters for their fabulous conversation and service....truly an enjoyable evening! Can't wait to return to try their brunch!"
The hubby and I went for brunch. I had the meat omelette which was so flavorful that I wanted to go back the next day. The best part was that the wait was non existent on a weekend so hurry before everyone knows about this place.
Had a wonderful birthday dinner for my mother-in-law. We were a big party and everyone at Crio welcomed all of us and treated us great. The dinner was delicious. It was a great time and the birthday girl was very happy. Thank you to Crio for a wonderful time.
"I don't write many reviews, but I had to for this place.  Food and drinks are amazing at very reasonable prices. Been there 3 times in the last 3 months, and except for breakfast dines, it's rare for us to go to a place that often. We've had the steak frites and it was very tasty, perfectly seasoned. Also the other dishes we've tried - pork and salmon. The mussels with chorizo sounded weird at first, but were incredible. The scallops deserve to be an entree, not just an appetizer.  Salads are delicious.Service has also been quick and cheery.  On two of our visits, chef Danny came out to talk to us, and comped a dessert.  His wife, Magdalena, is also wonderful, as is the rest of the staff.  Great ambiance, not loud (I HATE loud restaurants!) with a cute, quirky decor.  Also, no meters in front on Clybourn, so you don't have to feed the pig!Go here, it's wonderful."
Very nice little restaurant. We came on Saturday around 1 and it wasn't crowded at all. Staff is really nice and a wide selection for brunch. Had the torta and it was excellent!
"This place absolutely rocks!!!  Totally recommend going to this place - everything was DELICIOUS!  Those empanadas and their salsas were amazing!!  Their fries, OMG! And their torta de carne asada, simply outstanding!  They accommodated all requests including making a white sangria that was not on their menu...it was yummy, BTW :)  We went back for brunch two days later for Mother's Day brunch and encountered some friends there, so we asked if it was okay to seat us together - they had a full house in reservations but accommodated our request with ease and added another table.  Brunch menu was yummy as well.  I'm a fan :-)"
Loved the ambiance. We had the empanadas for appetizer.  The Portabella ones were just ok but the the brisket ones they had as a special were so good I had to order more.  I drank the vero mango which was really good.  For entree we had the chorizo burger and the tacos De pato.  Both were excellent.  Burger was perfectly cook with a hint of spiciness and the slow cooked duck in my tacos was juicy and flavorful with all the right toppings.
"This is place is huge! And has a really nice atmosphere. Definitely a lot better than the restaurant that used to be there before Crio. Although a bit on the expensive side, the entrees were delicious! I had the fish tacos and they were juicy and full of flavor. The waitress was also very nice and made me an awesome customized michelada instead of just a boring beer. Having just gotten back from Mexico, I can confidently say I approve!"
Came here on a Groupon...I loved it...I just don't see it lasting very long as it's not in a very high traffic area... Hope it sticks around!The food was really tasty and the service was great.  Drinks were just as good!
"Came here on a Tuesday night and I was the only one in the place, kinda made me nervous. Place itself however looked great with big murals and art pieces all over the dining room which I thought was great. The host greeted me right away and led me to the table where she explained the specials and the menu. Ordered the empanadas which I thought were okay, flavor was a little lacking. I then orded fish tacos, they were quite delicious! Moist, crispy, and popping with flavor. The cocktails were also divine, not too sweet but definitely not weak cocktails either. Great service, very attentive. Waiter kept checking to make sure everything was good even when the place started getting busy. I would definitely go back! Great for dates and girls night also."
Chile Relleno was amazing! The Empanadas were not that good though.. definitely not enough filling.
"A really nice and clean restaurant bar. Don't know if this is routine but it was nice to start off with the butternut squash for the soup of the day. We shared the scallop for appetizers and it was good. For entree, I had the steak frite and my friend the pork belly. The drinks were good and strong. The food was really good, although some of the stuff was lukewarm, as if they waited to bring everything out at once. Service was also really good. I like the specials they have for their beer although I didn't get a chance to try it, I will be back to give it a try because the place was warm and friendly.- Heard their brunch is one of the best around and that is the go to menu. I guess I'll have to try it."
My bf and I had a groupon for this place and thought it was great! We had the chorizo mussel appetizer which was INCREDIBLE. For our meals we had the burger with andouille sausage and fish tacos. Definitely go with the burger over the tacos! The burger was excellent. The fish tacos were just okay to me. Way too much garnish on the taco itself.Service was really great! Our waitress brought us out a free desert so that was really nice! I'd definitely come back without the groupon. The place has some really neat art and great ambiance as well. Good for a date night for sure.
Our favorite brunch spot in Chicago. The food here is amazing and the staff is friendly and attentive. I can not say enough good things about CRIO. A must visit.
"Went over Fourth of July weekend for a bday dinner~ service was great- half priced sangria special. Music and the ambiance was cool- easy parking on the street. Tried their fish tacos (three tacos and pretty big portion and flaky fish tenders) empanadas- tasty and not greasy, the best thing ever was their mac and cheese. Gooey, cheesy, mixed with chunks of sausage. Mussels- was okay, the sauce/broth was a little salty."
"Decided to grab a groupon and check this place out (there is also a 10% off coupon w a yelp checkin). Started w the empanada appetizer one with a spinach filling and other with corn both were pretty good. Then I got the steak frite (sp?). The steak came out bloody and great. Only thing was the chimmichurri sauce was really oily, next time id ask for it on the side bc ever bite was dripping with oil. I would give this place a four but the service was unfortunately disappointing, esp considering it was 5:30pm on a Saturday and they were not busy. The waitress was nice enough but she didn't clear our utensils or drinks, she would just bring us more stuff which cluttered the table. Then she never checked on us so we would have to go to the bar to order drinks and it took a few attempts to flag her down for the check. I would give Crio another shot, hopefully we'd get a better server."
"I went to Crio on Cinco de Mayo around 7pm with my friend after a grueling day of bridesmaid dress shopping. We were starving. The atmosphere was pretty weird and we expected it to be a lot busier on Cinco de Mayo ($5 margs!). There were only a few other tables that were busy. The service was pretty good.We had the loaded cheese fries, the original margarita, and we each had a few tacos. I had the special taco (chorizo and potato) and the fish taco. She had the fish taco, the duck taco, and the vegetable taco.The cheese fries were a delicious start, but they were probably a better fit for more than two people because the serving was massive. They were covered in delicious gooey cheese sauce and pulled pork. That was my favorite part of the meal. The margarita was pretty good too. If I would have stopped eating there, I would have given the restaurant more stars.The chorizo taco was really greasy and the sauce on it was overly concentrated with cilantro, which I did not like because cilantro tastes like soap to me. I also had the fish taco, which was good but was a little heavy on the grease.My friend said the same thing about the fish taco. She also said the duck taco was a little greasy. Overall, she did not enjoy the vegetable taco, but she thought that was mostly because she was not a vegetarian nor the biggest fan of mushrooms. I would like to return to try to chorizo burger and see if it can change my mind."
"This place has potential but needs alot of work. The ambience is nice with cool art on the walls and just the right amount of lighting. However, the drinks had no alcohol in them and we paid $20 for steak and frites that had almost no steak. It was like 5 tiny little strips. you definitely expect way more for that price at a bar and grill type restaurant. The way to gain customers is to not be cheap. put more into the food and drinks and the money will come"
"I have to say that I was extremely stoked about coming here after reading and hearing great things about this place. Maybe those people were referring to the brunch? I came here for dinner on a Friday night and was eagerly anticipating the delicious meal I was hoping to get, especially after the ""compliments of the chef"" corn and popcorn soup which was 'lick the bowl' delicious. I ordered the steak and frites with chimichurri sauce on top and was completely disappointed. The chimichurri was too salty and the man candy(bf) said it was because of ""too much garlic"" that I thought it was too salty, but I have to tell you I am a woman that loves garlic and rarely calls a dish too salty. BF's fish tacos were less than impressive....I had one bite and that was enough to know I didn't want anymore. We did have the scallops as an appetizer, and they were OKAY. I don't know that I've ever come across a scallop that I didn't like or wouldn't eat again and I'd probably never have their scallops again. All I could taste was Oregano, so much in fact that it overpowered the scallop which is practically perfect by itself. The dessert which was also ""compliments of the chef"" (they don't have an actual dessert menu, but are working on it) was deeeeelicious. It was a flan type custard with a raspberry drizzle that had my bf and I fighting for the last bite. What I find interesting was that the two items that were 'on the house' were the most impressive. The first one made us stoked about the rest of our meal and when that was disappointing as all heck, they turn around and give us this incredible dessert.  Moral of the story is that the items that are not on their actual menu are the best items. Maybe brunch is better? I'll still give them a second shot in hopes that I can enjoy at least one meal here, that IS on the menu."
Mmmmm. This is one high quality establishment. The food is always fresh and delicious. Great for casual dining or date nights!
"I've been to Crio at least 4 times since it has opened and the food is always on point! Delicious, cooked to perfection and the presentation is always above Instagram worthy #criochicago! The ""fat-free"" loaded fries are my favorite! Smothered with a heaping pile of pulled pork and dripping in beer battered cheddar cheese this appetizer is well worth the extra hour of cardio.  The restaurant is spacious with 2 rooms that gives the dining room a more intimate feel rather than just an eat in pub.  The dining room wall has the most beautiful mural I have ever seen! It's a must see in Chicago, truly a work of art! This place is definitely my new favorite spot in Chicago!"
"Hells yea friend! This brunch was ON POINT. Great service with some serious sorcery going on in the kitchen. Bottomless bloodies and mimosas?!?!? Say what?!?I'll be back in a heartbeat. My omelette was smoky, meaty, and delicious. Very complex flavor profile for an omelette. Chilaquiles were equally delicious. Green and mean. Cheesy and with some over easy.Ended with some french toast. SHUT THE FRONT DOOR. Looking for great brunch? Go here. Pull the trigger and win."
"Great brunch spot! Bottomless mimosas for $16, great food. I had the French toast, friends had eggs Benedict and oxtail torta, all very good.  Highly attentive waitstaff. Also has a great atmosphere; wall mural, chalkboard paint walls, lots of natural light. Drinks were delish-Crio has caught on that Squirt is the world's best mixer. Only downside is it's not very easy to walk/take transit to, but I'd love to go back."
"It was a great cozy place with good service and great food. My lady and I started with a side of mac and cheese, then got the steak frites and an order of duck tacos for our main. Everything was great (ESPECIALLY THE MAC AND CHEESE) and I do highly recommend a try. Only concern was that for us, the steak frites portion seemed small for the price (20$) relative to the other portions the joint offers. And I say that because the mac and cheese side (for 6$) was massive! Also, the duck tacos were a tad bit bland. It also was a little empty for a Friday at 6PM, but hey, it's nice to have dinner in peace and quiet sometimes. So over all, a 4 star instead of a 5 for two main reasons... the steak frites was a little small for me (I eat A LOT though) and the menu over all was lacking a little in funkyness. Definitely a place I'd go again though!"
"Hell yeah. This is a brand new spot and this family deserves all of the business it gets.  I hope they do as well as a business possibly can.  I will be back many times, hopefully with different friends each time!We went for brunch last weekend and our food was so fantastic.  My girlfriend got the loaded potato, and she said it was amazing.  I tried one of her last bites, and I agreed with her.  I'm considering getting it next time. This potato was gigantic and had all the great fixins you'd want on a loaded baked potato.   Since it was not the item I ordered, I don't really recall what was on it, but go to this place and find out for yourself. You won't be disappointed!I got the steak skillet...which blew me away. The meat was perfectly cooked to perfection exactly how I ordered it (medium, always...no exceptions) and so fresh.  This skillet also contained asparagus, corn, roasted potatoes (some of the best I've ever had in my life) and other ingredients as well.  I could not believe how good it was, I want to go back and eat it again right now.Although next time, I really want to try either a burger or the oxtail.The staff here is very personable and friendly.  Family-owned businesses are one of my favorite things in the world.  The owner Alberto and his nephew Jaime both stopped at our table to talk to us.I'll reiterate that this place serves incredible food and offers wonderful service. I'm eager to go back.  Tell your friends."
The food is delicious and made with all fresh ingredients. I've had multiple staff members as my server/bartender and everyone is SO nice and friendly! (Oh and brunch is to die for... Seriously!) A great place!
"Great place! I've been there twice, and can't wait to go back. Each time the food and service have been top notch. This past weekend when I took my mother there for dinner, the service alone was enough to make it a great visit. When the food came, we were both very happy.Now to try the brunch..."
"I moved to the neighborhood in July and I finally went to this place yesterday with three friends. I wish it didn't take me so long to discover this gem. The place was relatively quiet for a Tuesday night, but the staff was very friendly, and the chef even came out to chat with us after our meal. They have great and unique beers on tap. We ordered the mussels, tacos (fish and duck), and the chorizo burger. The mussels were delicious and a generous portion considering it was an appetizer, but I won't complain. Tuesdays, the tacos are on special and this was the first time I ever came across a duck taco, and it was pretty good. It is pulled duck and avocado and it was good. I am going to comeback to try their other menu items. Also, I need to check out brunch because they got bottomless mimosas."
"Dope spot. Food was very good, low key atmosphere and easy parking. I really enjoyed the mussels with chorizo. Maybe my expectations have been lowered from bad experiences with mussels in the past, but I appreciated not biting into sand for once. Will definitely stop through again if in the area."
"I came across CRIO on Groupon and the picture of the steak frites was so incredible that I had to check it out. This place is amazing. The food was perfect and the drinks were really, really good. We will be coming back here regularly and other people should do, this place is great."
"I visited Crio on a weekday evening. The place was maybe 15% full, so service was attentive & brisk. The décor has a hipster vibe, with a mural on one wall of the dining room, high ceilings and (dim) rustic lighting. The music was a nice mix, not too loud. The menu is compact, but feature intriguing choices at affordable prices. There are about a dozen cocktails, a couple of beers on draft plus maybe a dozen bottles, and a nearly non-existent wine list (merlot and sauvignon blanc, if I recall correctly).We had the empanadas; they were crispy and pleasantly flavored, though kind of bland. I liked a Jamaican salad -- the sweetness of mango and orange played well with cherry tomato, kale and almond. Chile relleno was fresh, flavorful and cooked just right, though be warned that it is muy picante. Sopes de panza was an interesting entrée; I liked the ingredients and the basic flavor, but it was too salty for my taste and the biscuit-like substrate was tough to cut gracefully with the dull table knife provided.For me, the food was A-OK, as was the service. The dim lighting doesn't work for me, though, and I probably won't return. I can see how other people might enjoy Crio more than I did, however."
"Delicious food and warm, welcoming atmosphere. The menu isn't overwhelming yet still difficult to choose from all the wonderful options. I cannot wait to go back to try it again!"
"GO! I had driven past this place (on an quiet part of Clybourn) several times and got inspired to go when there was a Groupon.  Atmosphere is super chic (blacks, reds, grays, white, murals, exposed brick) but welcoming for any attire (some people wore jeans, others formal/fancy dresses). We were greeted by the bartender, hostess and multiple servers while walking to our seat.  The mussels with chorizo (appetizer)...plenty of food and zippy spices.  At the recommendation of our server, I had the Sope de Panza.  Oh my gosh.  So, so good and filling. My husband had the fish tacos with the avocado cream sauce.  Equally good.  Generous pours of red wine and a very affordable bill (even without a Groupon). Can't wait to go back and try their brunch!"
"We went for a large party brunch on a Saturday afternoon. The space is large and bright- very inviting. The waitress accommodated the group well by keeping up with bottomless mimosas and maintaining separate checks from the start. I ordered a bottomless mimosa and chilaquiles with chorizo. Out of personal preference, the chilaquiles could have had more heat, but the flavor was delicious. The rest of the party was happy with their overall experience at Crio!"
"Crio has a fun atmosphere, and nice vibe. The food is tasty. We had the Mussels con Chorizo and they were delicious. Great way to start off the meal. I had the Chorizo Burger which was very good and had great flavor, however the Chorizo dominates the tastes. My girl friend had the Chile Relleno and it was amazing."
"Walked in and was greeted with a huge HELLO. Great space; cute, warm, fireplace, spacious. Service was amazing, family owned and you can tell. Great drinks, BOTTOMLESS drinks were NEVER empty, good amount of alcohol. The food was authentic and full of flavors, the chimichurry was unbelievable. Alberto and Carla made the whole visit amazing. Coming back and telling everyone else to too."
Amazing food amazing drinks friendly staff great setting great prices feels like being at home beautify decor and setting with good music
"We went here on a Thursday night to use a groupon. There was a nice sized crowd in the dining room, which has a very funky decor. For drinks we had a caipirinha and a pink martini with champagne. Both were delicious. We tried the loaded fries with pork and cheese - a very good sized portion, and they were also delicious. For our entrees, we both had the steak frites. The chimichurri was very good, but the steak was a little chewy. It was also a little undercooked to our liking (medium). But we figured we could heat up the leftovers and they would be fine. I would give the brunch and some of the other mains a try. They have a nice bar area with a couple of tvs as well. Service was excellent. The host and servers were pleasant and attentive."
My husband had purchased a groupon too this place   First time for both of us we went on a Friday night the best part was we were the first ones sat down right away didn't have too wait for a table like the rest of these restaurants. Loved the place loved how they decorated the place very vintage loved it loved the fireplace very cozy. Food was great my husband and I ordered the steak fritas plate yum! My 5 year old wanted a cheeseburger so they had mini slider ones that was also good we Loved the service and the music! Definitely  will be coming back too this place!
"The food was a 3.5, the drinks were a 2.5 and the potential of this place is a 5.I love trying new restaurants to see how they are developing their style. I also usually give them the benefit of the doubt on any shortcommings and am more interested in how I think they maturing into their style. For that reason I gave Crio 4 stars vs 3. We went here off a 2 person dinner groupon (app, 2 entre's and 2 drinks I believe). The drinks, while interesting in their ingredients (I had the bourbon one) were pretty weak and needed a lot more flavor/characterFor our apatizer, we got the scallops. They were cooked perfectly, huge and tasty. But we only got THREE???. Granted it was a groupon, and I can't remember the actual price, but it was very expensive to get just three. While we loved them, we would skip this again just because of the lack of value.I got the steak frit w/ chimichuri. This was excellent and cooked exceptionally rare. The chimichuri was perfect as well. I would definitely order this again. She got a salmon dish. At first the sauce on top was eh, and tasted strongly of ketchup which was kind of gross. After trying a forkful of the salmon, sauce and the pineapple hidden underneath the flavors came together excellently and made a great dish. But I can't get over how crappy that sauce was as a standalone considering it was all over the top of the fish. Overall, I was a little underwhelmed, but I feel this restaurant has amazing potential to hone in their menu, recipes and style and I will be coming back in a few months to see how things have progressed."
"Great food, nice ambiance and very reasonable prices. Music is pleasant and I was able to enjoy my conversation without screaming. Chef Daniel rocks! Everything I ate was well seasoned, delicious! Mussels with chorizo was really good so was my skirt steak. I'm definitely coming back."
Came for the Nutella French toast but the steak skillet and Chilaquiles were the best part of brunch. Definitely coming back to try the dinner menu.
A delicious twist to Latin oldies. Great ambiance...great drinks. Definitely coming back.
"We were on our way to an 80s themed party and were looking for a place for a quick bite and a cocktail and we stumbled upon Crio! This restaurant is quite a find! Great for date night or just to eat, the food is very good! The atmosphere is very pleasant and the food we enjoyed was a mix of American and Latin fusion. The menu is not complicated and gives detail about each selection. The service is outstanding. We were able to sample a few things before running out!Definately on the list to visit again and would recommend Crio highly."
"I really liked this place! Happy to have it in the neighborhood.I went with a group of 5 on a Sunday morning for brunch. A few of us got the bottomless mimosas which were well worth the deal. They also offer bottomless bloodies (I don't drink them) but it is $18 and at $9/ ea, if you are going to drink 3 it seems worth it. My friends loved the bloodies. I got the breakfast burrito which was awesome. Eggs, black beans, avocado and an awesome Latin red sauce that I couldn't get enough of. Potatoes were also amazing, crispy and well-seasoned. The service was a little slow but made up by a few free items- a round of mimosas, dessert, etc.They said they had a server call off unexpectedly. We were fine with it, they were nice enough. Really appreciate when a restaurant goes out of its way to create a positive experience. Will definitely be going back for dinner and the margs which look incredible."
"Most amazing veggie empanadas ever!! Went for a friend birthday, had a lot of different nibbles and everything was great!! Good staff."
"I went here on a Thursday night and like the other reviews said, it was almost empty and freezing! There were 2 other tables besides mine and everyone was wearing their winter coats at one! I ordered the fish tacos which were good except that they had this orange mayo sauce all over them. I thought it would be more of a subtle orange but it tasted like they actually put orange juice in the mayo, way too strong for me. My boyfriend got the chorizo burger which was just ok. I would maybe stop by here for drinks if I was ever in the area, but I don't think I'll make it a regular dinner destination."
"We went on a Saturday and they had $18 bottomless mimosas which were pretty good, nothing special. We got their nutella pancakes and they were extremely good!"
OMG! Loved the fish tacos!! The sweet potato fries were good and my friends had the burger with fries... his fries were great too! Nice quiet intimate place. And definitely liked that the bar area was separated from the dining area. I'll def be back!
Great food and great service. Jaime knows how to take care of his customers. He made sure everything was great and was continuously checking on us. Can't wait to go back.
"I wanted to wait to write a review until the second time I went to Crio just to have more than one experience to base my opinion on... Overall, Crio easily gets a 5 star rating.Why?*Extremely flavorful food w unique menu items to choose from...*Very friendly owners who personally visit your table to get feedback (& offer complimentary goodies to show their appreciation)*Very trendy bar/restaurant environment. Love the handcrafted mural on the wall!*Every table was full yet I still got checked on by my server and manager frequently. *The crowd looked to be mostly around my age (mid 30's).I went for brunch each time & can't wait to go back to try the dinner menu!! Order the stuffed poblano omelette; you won't be disappointed!"
