Crosby’s Kitchen
"Okay, so i'm sure that a ton of people with talk about the chicken and lobster deviled eggs and the Wrightwood salad... Folks, there's a way to do an easy quick dinner at Crosby's that's a great savior in the middle of your busy work week! Order a dinner salad (you get that awesome Wrightwood citrus vinaigrette dressing and sometimes even a deviled egg) and a cheeseburger with fries. If you're going with someone, split the salad! The burger is one of the best in the Wrigleyville/Southport area and doesn't get any fanfare... Give it a go! I promise you wont be disappointed.Things to avoid: -Stroller hour - the place is overrun with kids and strollers between 5 and 7 (if that's not your thing)-The Old Fashioned - shockingly they can't figure this drink out (everything else - pretty tasty)"
We came here for brunch on a Saturday around 10:00 and waited about 20 mins for an outdoor table. (Dog friendly! Plenty of dogs on the outdoor area)The service was fast and friendly.  Everything was decently priced.-Monkey Bread: So good! Great to share with 4+ people for an appetizer -Bacon Strata Benedict: Eh okay. I expected better.  It seemed kind of dense and dry to me.-Wood Roasted Chicken Hash:  It wasn't the kind of hash we were use to.  Everything was kind of big and chunky.  Too soupy.  Skip this.-Crosby Omelette: A good solid omelette.  Veggies felt fresh.  The potatoes and amazing.  Creamy & cheesy.
"Cozy neighborhood spot. Atmosphere is casual and servers are all very friendly. I can't pick one favorite appetizer either. From the lobster deviled eggs to the maple butter cornbread, I always want to lick my plate. The Wrightwood Salad was fantastic, but large, so plan on it for an entree. I split it with a friend and it worked out great. This is my favorite spot all year around, but especially in the winter. Warm fire, food, and atmosphere."
"A great place for brunch!Atmosphere/service: very casual and relaxed - a perfect way to start your Sunday. Servers here are all friendly and helpful if you have any questions.Drinks: if you like Bloody Mary's, you should get one here. Great flavor, accompanied by a skewer of a tomato/pickle/mozza/salami/jalapeno. Don't forget to add the bacon! It also comes w/ a beer back (more alcohol? Yessss)Food: the food was great and you could tell a lot of love was put into it. Our waitress said that Crosby's is famous for their rotisserie chicken, so whatever you get - make sure it has chicken in it!-Wood roasted chicken hash: I loved this dish. Crispy bacon? Yes. Over easy eggs? Double yes. Spicy bacon hollandaise? HELL YES. Seriously though, everything about this dish was amazing. Aside from the aforementioned ingredients, the chicken here is amazingly succulent. Also, the buttermilk biscuit that comes with it is mind-blowing: the outside was super crunchy, yet the inside of it was the fluffiest dough I've ever had (it had me yelling ""IT'S SO FLUFFY"" - word to Agnes from Despicable Me).-Monkey bread: one of the best monkey breads I have ever had. Sweet, fluffy, delicious. Git it.Again, a great place for brunch. Highly recommended."
"We got here just after the brunch rush on a Saturday afternoon, before the Cubs game. We were originally quoted a 45 minute wait time, but ended up only waiting 20 minutes or so. Crosby has an open rustic kind of feel to it with a lot of wood furniture/decor, which I'm digging.Our service was okay. I had to ask a few times for a straw, no big, but for my meal I sub the fries for asparagus and had to ask for the asparagus because it was delivered with fries. The burger itself was deliciously juicy and a pretty decent size. My friend raved about her hash browns and enjoyed my fries, basically Crosby has their potatoes down right.We shared the lobster deviled eggs and it was worth the $9 ($3/deviled egg/half). Yep, kind of pricey, but the creaminess of the eggs and sweetness of the lobster left us craving more, maybe they can add at least another half and make it 2 whole eggs?Enjoyed our quick lunch, looking forward to coming back."
"We decided to go here after finding that the wait over at Over Easy would be over an hour. Next time I'll just wait the hour.So upon arriving to Crosby's we were greeted by a host who informed us that the wait would be 30 minutes. We, being very hungry, decided that we'd wait and decided to check out the area. Also, the restaurant texts you when your table is ready... amazing.Once we got the text and our table we ordered the crab cake for starters. This was a great idea as it was beautifully presented and delicious. I don't normally eat coleslaw but it was a welcome part of this meal. Ironically (like rain on your wedding day) we were joking that we'd have to share our $13 crab cake and this actually ended up being the case. At $13 I think we could've been given at least 1 more crab cake.For our main meal my friend ordered Crosby's Omelette, my wife the Eggs Florentine, and I ordered the Wood Roasted Chicken Hash. They all arrived promptly and were presented very well. However, looks can be deceiving and we were all disappointed. The Crosby's Omelette was barebones and unseasoned. The Eggs Florentine were served with a thin slice of ham and thick stale bread. The best looking of the bunch, my chicken hash, had no flavor. The chicken was dry, the potatoes seemed like they were taken straight from a boiler onto my plate, and the hollandaise sauce was thin and watery. My portion of the meal was so bad I was forced to return it. I NEVER return food. I am always afraid of what I'll get in terms of ""bonuses"". Regardless, asked what I wanted in return, I ordered the oatmeal pancakes (thinking pancakes could not be done poorly) and waited approximately 15 minutes for them to be served to me. While the pancakes were pancake shaped, thats were the similarities ended. Upon biting into them I was immediately greeted by what seemed like whole chunks of salt and raw dough. I tried to drown away my sadness with maple syrup but nothing seemed to improve the flavor or consistency of my order.Needless to say we were very disappointed. The only reason Crosby's gets 3 stars is because the crab cake was delicious and the service (aside from the long wait for raw pancakes) was great."
"Crosby's outdid themselves today man. Came here again with my boyfriend and some friends and had a delicious hungover brunch. Best Bloody Mary in the city... I'm saying it now. Get it with bacon. Chicken hash was bomb, and the monkey bread the sweet sweet cherry on top. Thanks again for another amazing brunch."
"We went to Crosby's Kitchen for weekend brunch, and oh my yumm!! Their cuisine is unique, filling, and (most importantly) delicious! Love the all around Southern atmosphere and service was great!CK has the best creamy/cheesy hash brown side, and the biscuit with Fuji apple butter was delish as well. We started with the lobster deviled eggs, and while flavorful and unique, probably not worth it in value to get again, though I'd consider trying it once if you're a lobster fan. I had the Crosby Omelette, which was fresh and tasty. Hubby had the Bacon Strata Benedict...it was rich, hearty, and bacon - need I say more. His dish was definitely a unique concept and must try! The monkey bread on the next table over looked to die for as well!! Next time!As for drinks, hubby fell in love with the Bloody Mary. I'm not a big fan of them in general, so I can't comment there, but it has rekindled his love for them. We will definitely be back for another weekend treat! Excited to try their dinner menu as well after reading more reviews!"
"OK, I took the wife aka THE 1st Lady... to Crosby's Kitchen... It was good...pretty good. The waiter service was good...friendly & prompt...the food was well prepared and tasty. I decided to go conservative and had a Cheeseburger with Fries. My wife had The Deviled Lobster Eggs and  I forgot what else. It's been a few days since we've been there..So I've forgotten some details. However, I DO remember the dessert. my Wife had Key Lime Pie...I had The Chocolate Chip Cookie in the skillet with Ice Cream!!!.. YES!!!... I thought I was dreaming. I had one of my favorite desserts in the same week. I Guess it really WAS my birthday on the 21st!!. It was nice & hot WITH Ice Cream...I & ""The 1st Lady"" enjoyed the dining experience. Personally I think the dinner ON my actual birthday was better. Maybe it was because this restaurant was similar to it...However, it was good."
"I've now gone to Crosby's Kitchen twice--once for brunch, and once for dinner.  Thoughts:1.  If you like waiting in line, Crosby's has you covered.  With a reservation for brunch, I still waited about 30 minutes to be seated.  Without a reservation for dinner last Friday, the hostess said that we'd have about a 30-minute wait at 5 PM, so we took my daughter and another child to a park nearby to play and hang out.  At 5:45, we came back to continue waiting...and we were not seated until 6:15.  Given that most restaurants in Chicago actually go the other way and quote crazy-long wait times to dissuade you from waiting for a table, Crosby's goes the other way...to ill effect.2.  The brunch food at Crosby's is fine.  It's not great, and it's not bad.  During my brunch I tried the Southport Omelette (I'm pretty sure it was the omelette with artichokes) and an order of the buttermilk biscuits.  Not special, but the biscuits at least were served with a butter that was something a little out of the ordinary.3.  The dinner food at Crosby's is also fine, but a little less interesting.  I tried the Pike Place BBQ Salmon with a side of vegetables, which on my dinner night was asparagus.  Friends, the salmon was fine and the BBQ glaze was not spicy but tasty nevertheless...but the side of asparagus was sad, small in size and a little limp.  I was aiming for a light dinner but the portion size of both items was so small that I needed a bit more food.  I got a little lucky--we ordered the chicken fingers for my daughter and those were incredible, and she only ate like half of one and I got to eat the rest.  My wife got one of the salads, and while she didn't rave about it, we all agreed that the portion size was more than adequate.So many better options in this neighborhood or Chicago in general, but if you like to spend money and wait in line for average food, I would check this place out.  Otherwise, use Yelp for the powers of good, not evil!"
"We live just north off Southport, so ever since this place opened it has become one of our favorite local spots for a night out. It does get VERY crowded during peak times, so be prepared to wait. They also have a small bar, so if you're lucky you can grab dinner there, which is what we usually try to do. Also, they have a great patio that wraps around the place, so if you're luck enough to get a spot, there's some great people watching.Now, for the actual experience. The food is generally very good. We've only had one bad experience, so I try to not let that disturb our countless excellent experiences. Their menu is competitively priced and has options that would satisfy just about anyone. We typically go on the weekends, which is when they have Prime Rib as a special and OH MY is it good. There are only a few places that I get Prime Rib, just because I'm so picky (Lawry's and Harry Carry's) and Crosby's is right up there with them. It comes out perfectly cooked with a side of delicious mashed potatoes, I'm actually getting hungry thinking about this, too bad it's only Monday! I guess their ""specialty"" is the rotisserie chicken and to be honest I tried it once and wasn't blown away. It was good, but it just tasted like normal chicken to me.My girlfriend has tried countless menu items and has never been disappointed. She's had salad's, crab cakes (yum), sandwiches, and their chicken. She liked them all. We haven't tried breakfast or brunch, but judging by the amount of people that are there on Saturday's and Sunday's, I'd imagine it's pretty darn good.The service is always friendly and even though there's typically a wait, they do their best to quickly clean tables and get the next people in. There's not much room to wait, so if you can't grab a spot at the bar, you might find yourself outside. Also, they have a special where kids eat free (I'm not sure when), but be prepared to be surrounded by children during this time. It can get VERY loud when there's 10 different families surrounding you with small children. Overall, this is a great spot in the neighborhood. It continues to gain popularity and it's easy to see why. Their service is great and the food is typically very good. They also have a wonderful patio right on Southport and they are VERY dog friendly."
"I came here once for dinner with my roommate. We had two servers because one girl was training another girl. They were both really sweet and would trade off on whom came to the table. We couldn't decide what to have, so we split two things.Each of us started off with a glass of prosecco, which obviously was delicious.We split the Chicken Dip Sandwich with fries - the dip came on the side. Not my favorite - the chicken was dry, so it NEEDED the dip. And the dip was super salty. However, the shoestring fries were crisp and delicious. We also split the cheeseburger with a side of roasted veggies. Now, I did love both of these! The burger was juicy and cooked well, and that veggies were sautéed, I believe. I would go back for this!Other things on the menu looked delicious, as well. A bit pricey, but the food and service and quality."
Great food. Great wine. The sparking rose is delish. Get the biscuit for an appetizer. We love the pork chop and turkey burger. A bit pricier than the rest of the places around that area but worth it. Oh and the skillet cookie is scary good! My only wish is that they'd get on open table.
"Came here for brunch on a Saturday. We waited for 30 minutes for a table. Because the wait was so long , I expected the food to be out of this world delicious. Per the recommendation of our waiter I ordered the wood roasted chicken hash. The dish was very bland and had no taste. I can't say much about the other dishes, but they definitely need to give the chicken hash more flavor. Service was solid. My two colleagues enjoyed their meals."
"This is one of the better brunch spots I've been to in the area. Here are some highlights:First the restaurant itself has a cozy feel in a great location. I was lucky enough to sit in a booth near the fireplace which was perfect for the colder day that it was. The staff is very friendly and the service was EXTREMELY fast. For a Saturday around 1pm, we got our food almost immediately after ordering. Now let's get to the food. My friend suggested the bacon Strada Benedict and thank god she did. Probably the best Benedict I've ever had! It was delicious. It also came with a side of potato hash that was also great. They must have sprinkled magic on it because I couldn't get enough!! Overall, I'm really glad I checked this place out for brunch. TIP: We waited about an hour to be seated so just make sure you have plenty of time or live in the area and can chill out at home while waiting for a table."
"I think they could improve their seating process. It's just odd and doesn't feel accommodating to customers. Bartender was douchey. No, actually, I don't want your"" beer advisor"" interpretation of Daisy cutter. Because you have a beard, does not mean I care. I've drank like 7,000 of them. Please just pour the drink I'm recommending. Maybe your girlfriend at home who wishes you would propose, would like to talk about it."
"This place had amazing reviews, so I wanted to check it out. I don't know if I just went on an off day, but everything to me was just average. I got the grilled fish sandwich and it seemed to lack flavor. The sangria was on point though."
"This place is awesome!! Got there on a Saturday around 10am right before a rush hit. We were seated immediately and served within 10 mins of sitting down. It was almost unreal!Even with the speed of the service, nothing was left lacking. Beautiful presentation, delicious and unique food and a friendly server! My two favorite dishes at the table were the southport omelette and the breakfast sandwich. Usually when an omelette says it has goat cheese, I feel a little deprived by the amount they throw in. The southport was almost gushing with goat cheese, which I loved!! The asparagus and artichoke were a perfect compliment to pull together an awesome omelette. The breakfast sandwich was STACKED!! And surprisingly it kept together pretty well. The thick cut bacon and perfectly toasted bread made the sandwich. Ugh so good. This place has got it all. Great food, trendy and rustic atmosphere and the cutest lil patio! For realz check it out. Oh and bring ur pup along, this place welcomes tail wagers."
"Mother's day and the wait (not long for the day) was well worth it.   Crab cakes yummy and full of crad, sauce was great also.   Son head an awesome strsk and wife really enjoyed the chicken. .Great host/managemen.  biscuits where to die for can't say enough good thingsGrest meal"
"Excellent service! We sat outside on a weekday and the weather was great! Started off with the crab cake, which I highly recommend the slaw on the side is amazing!!! Also ordered the lobster stuffed deviled eggs, were good but the crab cakes were better!! Split the filet with the mashed potatoes for the entree. The filet was cooked perfectly and the potatoes were moist and delicious! Highly recommend the atmosphere and the service!"
"This is my go to neighborhood spot! The food is always delicious and the service is wonderful.I love love love the wrightwood salad... Because hellooo - CORNBREAD croutons! Plus the flavor is one of a kind. Sometimes it's difficult to find a great salad but this place won't disappoint. The Brussels sprouts salad is great too!If you're there for dinner I recommend trying the skillet cornbread with maple butter. Yep, maple butter!! It's amazing and probably the best cornbread I've ever devoured. The maple butter takes it over the top. I love this place and would recommend it to anyone!"
"This is a neighborhood bar/restaurant serving great food !    It's all about the rotisserie chicken!  All 10 of us ordered it...sublime !  Start with the skillet cornbread, then grilled artichokes, and btw, the Brussel Sprout Salad was a dinner in itself!  All very tasty and fresh, but it's still all about that chicken !Great female bartender making great martinis, very accommodating, all super nice staff!  We were in town for a graduation, but there were Tons of little kids and the place was uber noisy!  Our friend who lives in Chicago said that is not usually the case, it's more of a 'date' place."
"From the outside, Crosby's Kitchen looks like another bar or pub that is attempting to make generate additional revenue by serving brunch.  This is not the case!  The food is excellent and the staff is extremely warm, courteous and professional.  The deviled eggs are scrumptious and the chicken dip sandwich is quite good.  Our only complaint is that our young son was not able to try the ""Monkey Bread"" because the kitchen had run-out of this item by noon on the Saturday we were there.  By the way, Crosby's Kitchen is ""family friendly"" and, when there is a wait, you can shop at nearby stores given that the hostess will text you when your table is ready.  Enjoy!"
"After wanting to try this place for many months, I decided to take the plunge last weekend. We got there around 9:30am, just in time to meet the morning rush. Even though we beat it we did feel a little rushed by the staff however, I will give them the benefit of the doubt on that one.My boyfriend and I split the monkey bread and the chicken hash. The monkey bread was simply amazing. Warm and gooey and better than my dad's version! Just the right amount to share with 2-3 people. I have to say I was a little disappointed with the chicken hash though I think it may just not have been what I was expecting. The biscuit served with the dish was fabulous though and that is coming from a biscuit fanatic. The restaurant atmosphere was enjoyable as well and I would love to venture back for lunch and dinner on the patio."
"We came here for dinner on Friday night and enjoyed our experience! We ended up sitting at the bar after waiting for about 30 minutes. I think they forgot our name on the list as when I went back to tell them we had sat at the bar, he had to scroll all the way down to the bottom to check us off - oops! Anyway, we started with the spinach and artichoke dip and the lobster deviled eggs. Both were good! I think they need to add a 4th deviled egg, though. Seems weird to only serve 3. For our mains, I had the Ahi Tuna salad and my friend had the ribs. I really liked my salad - it was very fresh and the tuna was cooked perfectly! My friend really enjoyed her ribs and took the remainder home to her husband to eat. All in all a great, chill place to have a meal."
"I came here on a weekend night with a group of friends, who have all wanted to try Crosby's for quite some time, and we were all pleasantly surprised. I had the rotisserie chicken which I highly recommend. My friends tried many different things and no one had a bad experience. The menu looks great and I would like to go back to explore it a little more. Definitely worth a try in the southport area."
"As a resident in the neighborhood, this place is a no-brainer go-to. Everything on the menu is fairly priced and high quality. Service is killer and they're always accommodating. Get the biscuits for an appetizer. Get the monkey bread at brunch.Enjoy the patio. Love your life."
I stumbled across this place with a friend that was visiting from out of town. We went there for brunch and both loved it. The atmosphere and food were worth the wait. The monkey bread is a must. My fiance and I love to go here now.
Tried this neighborhood spot after I read a very informative Yelp review. The deviled eggs are worth trip alone. The cheese burger was perfectly cooked and very tasty. The beer selection was great. Overall good atmosphere and cool vibe in place. They have great heat lamps for these false summer teasing days in Chicago this spring. I will make this spot a regular stop for a beer and tasty tavern food.
"What a delightful neighborhood spot with a bunch of offerings and no pretense. Our table shared the appetizer cornbread (wonderful with little pieces of jalapeno that were very subtle...and served in an iron skillet) and the deviled eggs lobster (could have been the hit of the night and would have made a great entrée if your arteries were up to the challenge). For dinner two of us had crab cakes as an entrée (filled with nice chunks of crab meat and very little filler), the chicken & biscuit (served in an iron skillet just like a small cassoulet would be...lots of tender chicken and veggies...the biscuits were also very nice but there wasn't enough juice/butter/what have you to accompany them), and the veal brisket stroganoff (nice but the weakest of the table - not enough veal and just a bit too fatty, but still a nice subtle taste). They also have a full-service bar...nice wines, many beers, and reasonable drinks. We did not have time for dessert but will on our next trip. Service was casual but spot on. All in all this was a very nice dining experience and we'd return in a minute."
"I've come here twice, and while I haven't been blown away by the food, it's pretty good. A friend recommended the salmon to me once, saying it was her favorite in the city, and I agree it was quite good. However, the sides could complement it better- most of the options are starches. The reason for so few stars is that the service the last time wasn't great. Our server was a little rude until it was time to drop off the check. Seems to be a good spot for families, so there was a handful of crying kids. Not a huge deal, but something to keep in mind depending on the ambiance you are looking for."
"Hands down the best eggs benny I EVERRRR have had. It was pouched eggs over corn bread with the special chili on top. Oh. My. Gosh.Best brunch! Also great location, since this is a popular restaurant, put your name on the list and do some shopping- great boutiques!"
"We went to Crosby's at the recommendation of a friend...and, better than we anticipated!We shared the Rotisserie Chicken and the Crabcake Sandwich at the suggestion of Brandon our waiter...there are a number of sides that are offered BUT, without question-the potatoes with bacon and cheddar cheese was outstanding !!!Must try pb&c!!!   The service and atmosphere were terrific...can'tokiklk  say enough good things about Crosby's Kitchen...uhkkknwill definitely return!Pat & Dennis"
"My friend and I came here on a very busy night in the Southport Corridor. The host staff was very attentive and got us seated 2 to 3 minutes after we walked in. Our server was very upbeat, and gave great recommendations on what to get off of their menu.We ordered the Spinach Dip as an appetizer and it was delicious, also brought out very promptly. I got the Wrightwood Salad, I wish I could have that every day! It was a larger salad with great toppings and a tasty dressing plus rotisserie chicken. My friend got the burger and fries, she loved it!The whole entire experience was what every dining experience should be like! The prices were reasonable and the staff was excellent!"
Great friendly warm place. We love it here. Corn bread rocks and the entire rotisserie selection rocks. Had prime rib special a bit thin cut for $32.  Great waitress. When I got my premium $8.00 beer it came in a short snifter. I hate ordering a new premium beer paying more and getting less its a beer pour me a glass for $8.00 or at the least Tell Me!Warm cookie dessert was great.
"A proper Bloody Mary. Came here for drinks with an old friend specifically for the Bloody Mary and we were not disappointed. Not only that, but the bartender was incredibly friendly and helpful. The wait for a table was over 45 min, but we sat at the bar in just a few. Hope to come back again soon."
This is our go to restaurant in the neighborhood.  My wife and I live down the street and frequently eat here.  The food is delicious with a good variety!
"Nice atmosphere but unacceptable amount of vegetarian options. Wait, ""amount"" and ""options"" doesn't really work when there's only ONE choice. What is it? A veggie burger. This is the hallmark of an uninventive chef or owner, someone who can't imagine not eating meat so of course the logical solution is to put some rice and beans between a bun. The veggie burger itself was okay by veggie burger standards, but that's a low bar. Overall unsatisfactory meal. All the salads had meat (or fish). The veggie burger was gigantic, but my companions all had pretty small portions. I will say the fries were pretty decent, the server was fine, and this was a trendy pub-like place.  For us vegetarians, we know a chef or owner has no clue about vegetarian eating when the options are a veggie burger or something made out of a slab of eggplant. For 2014, on a busy street in trendy Chicago, this is unacceptable."
"My friend and I were driving down Southport looking for a spot to eat when we saw Crosby's Kitchen.  I loved the decor and ambiance in Crosby's.  We were seated right away at one of the few open tables on a busy Thursday afternoon lunch hour.We shared the smoked salmon, and it was amazing.  I could have made it my whole lunch.  So, so good!  For my main, I ordered the grilled fish sandwich.  It was also amazing! My only complaint was that the server never returned with things like water and extra bread for the app.  Other than that, I was super impressed with Crosby's!"
"This is one of my favorite go to spots in the neighborhood. The food is always good, simple, cooked well and it feels like home inside.My favorites:Cornbread: Phenomenal! I always ask for extra maple butterWrightwood Salad: Great, super flavorful saladChicken: Heartier meal, cooked perfectly. Yum!Bloody Mary: It has a kick, served with a baby beer"
"I came here for brunch during Marathon training in 2014 and thought everything was okay. Food was okay. Bloody Mary was okay. Service was okay.I need to stress the fact that I was running upwards of 50 miles a week at this point and ate anything set in front of me with gusto, so for this meal to fall flat says a lot.I guess I heard a lot of hype about it and that hype wasn't lived up to.The decor, however, was fantastic."
"In whitebread north-side neighborhoods such as the Southport corridor, bland American bar & grill joints are a dime a dozen.  I tend (justifiably, I think) to pay these places no attention; however, sometimes, as my wife pointed out, I am too dismissive, because when the service is cheerful and the setting is handsome and the food is delicious...then an establishment like this is right on the money.  That's what I feel is going on at Crosby's.I like the unobtrusively attractive aesthetic, and they happen to play some really good background music (and at a very reasonable volume, too).  Even better, the service from everyone from host to wait staff to bussers seems genuinely warm.  But all of that is mere gravy for the deeply satisfying food.  I mean metaphorical gravy, not literal gravy.My sole visit so far was for brunch, but I am sure that I will return.  We started with the skillet cornbread, a revelation.  They serve it with maple butter, but it stands beautifully on its own, with jalapenos and (I think) some cheese baked in.  I also ordered a cup of the black bean and chicken chili, a natural match for the cornbread.  The ""cup"" of soup is really a small bowl, and comes with tortilla chips.  Crosby's does not want a customer to walk away hungry, that's for sure.The obvious entree choice for me was the roasted chicken hash, and it was absolutely outstanding.  Get this:  roasted chicken, bacon, carrots, onions, and potatoes topped with eggs and spicy bacon hollandaise.  !  It tasted even more incredible than it sounded.  I appreciated that the potatoes were not a dominant ingredient, like the hashes from many lazy kitchens.  The hollandaise was a masterful touch, and the side biscuit was also very, very good.  Overall, this is one of the best breakfast dishes I've ever had.  They offer a small but thoughtful draft beer list, so I enjoyed a Great Lakes Edmund Fitzgerald with all of the above bounty.  I also took half my breakfast home.  I can see that this place must be wonderful in the cold weather months, but it was highly enjoyable on a fine autumn morning with the windows open too."
Birthday dinner with a friend! Ordered a few cocktails from the list. Decent but a bit overpriced. Cornbread was very tasty. The sweet maple butter had a very interesting flavor. I'd recommend trying bites with and without the butter. Rotisserie chicken tasted wonderful. Mashed potatoes are a must! Space was decorated pretty nicely and felt cozy while we watched the snow fall.
"A solid 3 stars. Very welcoming and very homey. Staff seem friendly enough, and the simple menu covers a lot of ground. We were quoted 15 minutes for a to-go pickup which was impressively fast.Food in general was AOK, but sadly, turkey burger was super dry. Spinach dip, lobster deviled eggs, sausage and sides including slaw and a biscuit were delicious but temps were all a bit off. Might be the kitchen's fault but more than likely it was the thin cardboard boxes the to-go was served in. Next time we'll dine in, and enjoy the cozy atmosphere."
"I really enjoy going to Crosby's--it's close to my house, has a great vibe, and has reliable food. Brunch is nothing special and extremely busy--I recommend going for dinner instead. Their specials are to die for. One night it was a pan-seared whitefish with brussels sprouts and I swear, they were the best I've ever had. I've been trying to replicate the recipe ever since. I also recommend the cornbread and the spinach artichoke dip. My only major complaint is that we never seem to have good service. It feels like the place is understaffed and does not know how to adequately manage a crowd. The food usually makes up for the service, however, and waiters are always friendly despite being distracted!"
"Expected an above average dining experience based on reviews. We were all disappointed. The apps we ordered were biscuits and the Maryland crabcake. Biscuits were on the dry side but edible with the house made rhubarb and strawberry jam. Crabcake was made with premium chunks of crab meat but the bottom was extra crunchy, a second away from being burnt. We ordered 3 entrees. Chicken dip was mediocre. Not to mention I bit into 2 rib bones. It's kinda like crunching on egg shells in your omelet. Made me lose my appetite.The burger was wet but decent. The ribs were awful considering CK also owns smoke daddy's. My mom ordered a whole rack because I trusted they'd be amazing. Instead they were chewy, gristly, and almost inedible. May give CK another try because my kid can eat free between 4-6pm. Then again may not because what will her parents eat. Overpriced sub par American fare. Chili's anyone?"
Delicious food!!! Great atmosphere! Friendly staff!!! Get the rotisserie chicken or the ribs with mashed potatoes. You won't be disappointed (-;
"Just enjoyed an impromptu breakfast with a friend at Crosby's Kitchen. Saturday morning around 9:15 am we were seated right away, with no wait, however, as the morning went on we could see the wait begin (hint, hint - do yourself a favor and get here earlier then you usually would).Our waiter was Miguel and he was very nice, with a great smile. We each started the morning off with a cup of coffee and the monkey bread. Their coffee was good, nothing impressive, but the monkey bread was delicious. I make this at home and it's very easy to make, but the presentation was cool and very easy to share. On to breakfast... I had the eggs Florentine, which was delicious, however, I was disappointed to see the ""smoked turkey"" looked like lunch meat you get at the deli section of the grocery store (frown face). The poached egg was prepared perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was decent. I liked the little bit of spice added. All in all the dish itself was very good.My friend had the French toast and very much enjoyed (FYI-get the powdered sugar on the side, otherwise it's overkill) She said the flavors were great and like the hint of orange. We rounded out breakfast with mimosas. Nothing special, just a breakfast staple.The overall feeling of Crosby's Kitchen has a great vibe and good service. I hope to stop by again if I am in the area to try something new.Oh and as weird as this sounds, the bathroom was clean and very cute."
"I was down the street at a friend's house and we wanted to stop in for dinner before a concert here. We called ahead and were told that there was no wait at all and to come on in. When we got there we were told it would be an hour and a half. Excuse me? That doesn't just happen in the 15 min it took us to get there. And the hostess was less than apologetic. Rude.I have eaten here and the food was good, just didn't like the whole situation this last time I went. At least apologize someone gave us completely wrong info!"
"We first saw this place when we were at this year's Taco Fest at Southport. They had a delicious chicken and pork taco that enticed us to come back for dinner.The layout of this restaurant was very modern and sleek. You could see a good part of the kitchen, which is always a plus for me. I would describe the vibe of the neighborhood as young 20-25 year olds, but Crosby's had an older adult vibe, which impressed me a lot. There was plenty of outdoor seating along with these huge flames covered in metal to keep customers warm.We started off with drinks and I got the Southport Shandy, which is basically a homemade Summer Shandy The waitress informed me that they ran out of the wheat beer they normally use and was going to use a gluten free beer called Prairie Path. My wife is gluten free and she and I love this beer so it was a great surprise to include it in the drink. The drink itself was refreshing and flavorful and when I come back, I'll probably ask for them to make it that was again.The reason I didn't give this place for stars was because of the dish I had. I ordered the rotisserie chicken and swapped the mash potatoes with potato salad. The presentation was awesome, but the chicken was dry. The potato salad had good flavor, but the pieces of potato were too big so I didn't get to taste a lot of the sauce. Overall, this place is a gem and I'm sure the rest of the dishes are perfect. I will be back real soon."
"Crosby's is, hands down, my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Whenever I have visitors in town, I always take them here. It's also me & my boyfriend's ""go-to"" for when we don't know what we're in the mood for.If you go for brunch, the monkey bread is one of the best things I've ever had. The hashbrowns are also unique and delicious. The best appetizer is a tie between the spinach dip, the corn bread, and the jam & biscuits. I typically order the Wrightwood salad (with salmon) or the Ahi Tuna salad. My boyfriend loves their chicken dip sandwich with the green beans (when they're in season). I don't think you can order anything from here that isn't amazing.The atmosphere is very homey and welcoming. Every staff member I've encountered is helpful and kind. They have a ""kids eat free"" from 4-6pm, so I'd recommend going outside of this time frame because it's usually packed with kids. Other than that, it's definitely a place to try if you haven't already."
"This place is decent, although there can be a long wait during peak hours. I'd have liked a little more variety in terms of vegetarian options in the menu, but the sandwich I did end up getting was delicious (if a little messy to eat).In warm weather, the patio is great - there's a lot of families and puppies enjoying the place."
"The food was exceptional, but when we ordered coffee, there was spinach in the creamer. Also, at the bottom of the cup was a sugar packet wrapper. The thing is, we didn't put sugar in our coffee. We told our waiter, and all he said was ""Well that's embarrassing."" No apologies. The food might be good, but clean dishes are appreciated. That was hands down the nastiest dining experience."
"Atmosphere- warm, cozy, perfect place to go to on a Saturday afternoon during a Chicago winter!  Waited only  10 minutes but worth it with the booth next to the window to accommodate my 17 month old daughter!Service- staff is awesome! Service is great and accommodating.Food-  Corn Bread- Amazing!  Fried Egg sandwich- best I ever had!  What's not to love when you put bacon, egg, tomato, and mayo on good bread?  Lobster Deviled eggs- not bad, understand the cost because lobster is expensive, just better appetizers here.  French Toast- OK, a little bland but nothing that a little more syrup can fix!  Bloody Mary- outstanding, especially with the Miller beer back!Location- trendy Southport area, will probably have to wait on the weekends but its worth it.  I wish this place existed when I lived in the area.  Great place to have a drink, watch a game, or have a good meal with family friends that are visiting from out if town! To the reviewer who left a tip for Southport moms not to bring their kids that don't know how to act in a restaurant, I have some advice for you:  - Don't complain until you actually have a meal in a restaurant with your own kid!  - This place is not Alinea!  -  The Southport mom's are the ones paying taxes in the neighborhood to have good places like Crosby's!  -  Let a kid be a kid!"
"What I didn't like: small portions, dry chicken, yet high pricesWhat I did like: wine selection, outside heaters, staffI wish they had the tacos they served at taco fest on their menu.  I would probably only go back for tacos and/or wine."
"When a restaurant is jam packed at 12:30 on a weekday, it's usually a good sign.  Well, the crowd certainly didn't steer us in the wrong direction.  The lunch my friend and I had was exactly what we were craving.My friend ordered the fish sandwich: which had blackened tilapia, remoulade sauc, lettuce, tomato and onion.  He couldn't stop raving about it!I ordered the the Wrightwood Salad: rotisserie chicken, tomatoes, craisins, avocado, goat cheese, corn, almonds, citrus vinaigrette and topped off with corn bread croutons.  I don't think I have ever said that a salad is decadent without being over the top.  But that's exactly what this salad was. The combination of ingredients was off the beaten path, but established a harmonious balance that was a treat for the palette.  It's been a few weeks since my visit to Crosby's Kitchen yet I find myself still dreaming of the salad :)."
Brunch was good.  Kentucky Mule was fantastic.  Drinking and people watching on Southport is always great.The staff is very attentive and efficient.  They accommodate families with small children with a smile and a kid's menu.
Be prepared to enjoy the large portions and easy going atmosphere.  We sat outside for dinner Sunday night.   Our waitress was super nice!Lobster deviled eggs came in 3 halves and it was a fight to see who will get 2. (next time we will have to get two orders.)  Double thick pork chop was enormous and juicy.  Mashed potatoes side was chunky with skin.  Crab cake had a crispy panko crust and came with mustardy slaw.  The brussel sprouts salad was enough to serve two as well.
"Great experience here for lunch. We were a few minutes early but they let us come in and warm up (it was brutally cold outside). Really, really great seafood options. The lobster deviled eggs were great. Everything was delicious, and our service was great (though it wasn't very crowded when we went, so not sure if that's always the case).This isn't in my neighborhood but I'll definitely make a trip back for more."
"The creative menu and the extremely kind staff make this restaurant worth the trip. I had the house granola over berries and sweet mint green tea. Absolutely, simply wonderful."
"Came back here for brunch. Being a Dunlay's fan I knew I would like brunch here.Bloody mary - can't go wrong! Love the high life chaser. Get yours with Bacon. One of the best bloody's I've had.Breakfast sandwich was tasty, but something about it wasn't QUITE as good as Dunlay's :) Maybe it's just in my head, or the fact that this time I ordered it without mayo. actually I'm quite confident that's why.Either way service was great for our group of 10 on a Saturday. Love the location too!"
"Love this place.It's become a neighborhood staple since we moved to this part of town a couple years ago.Obviously, it's part of the Frasca, Dunlay's family so it has to be good!The one thing you HAVE to get with your breakfast is the potatoes. It's a hefty portion of garlicky, creamy, julienne/augratin/hash type. I love these and refuse to split them unless I'm super full.I love their fried egg sandwich, the fact that you can get an english muffin instead of regular ol bread, and their bloodies.They serve their famous Wrightwood salad which is also one of my faves. Anything with goat cheese is good in my book.Everything is fresh here and they have indoor and outdoor seating that can accommodate 2 to a big group of people. Be careful--it gets crowded with dogs and kids so don't expect to slide right in at 11am on a Sunday without a wait."
"Had a great dinner here tonight.  We had the corn bread,  chicken and biscuits (a deconstructed pot pie), the turkey burger and the brussels sprout salad and the skillet cookie.All were good.  The salad was GREAT.  The chicken was very tender, very juicy.  The turkey burger was what you would expect but not really remarkable.  As others have said, the atmosphere is so warm and welcoming.  We lucked out and had a table right near the fire place.  It was a fine for those of us who sat on the banquette side  but the person sitting in the chair on the opposite side did start to feel warm.  Service was great.  Very nice waiter who checked in with us several times through out our meal.  Food came quickly.  Never felt rushed or like someone was impatient for us to leave.All in all a very nice dinner out and we do plan to return."
"Crosby's is a dual threat - great ambiance + awesome food.I get the turkey burger or rotisserie chicken quite often and they never disappoint. Also a solid breakfast spot, just get there early or plan on putting your name in for a wait ... but they can just text you so par-ooze around Southport."
"Pretty popular but we've never had to wait too long and we don't have a problem bringing our toddler here (even mix of 20-something's and families)Their monkey bread is ridiculously good for brunch (but does sell out!) and I love the eggs Benedict. For lunch, I almost always get a burger and I'm not usually a burger gal.Also you can't beat this place in the summer - the outside patio is great"
"We were initially attracted to this place by its location and quaint atmosphere. All three of us were first timers and did not even look the place up on Yelp before trying it. We shared the grilled artichoke appetizer, which had great flavor and was ideal for sharing between the three of us. We each ordered something different and were all satisfied. I would give them an A for taste, portion and speed of delivery. The only thing keeping them from a five star review is the fact that the menu is fairly limited and none of the options were very specialized...aka the menu was kinda basic and underwhelming. If I go back I would try the Bloody Mary and monkey bread.Tip: they have sriracha upon request."
"Decent food, horrendous service. Although it's hard to screw up mashed potatoes and biscuits. It is, however, evidently difficult to serve a vodka soda and a vodka water, orders which they couldn't figure out three times. The manager finally came over, and stood awkwardly behind my friend, so that was creepy. He arrogantly promised to get my drink order right. Again, fail. We've all worked in the industry, and we were all appalled. Then the drinks that we sent back showed up on the bill and they charged me extra for bacon even though it was included in the list of ingredients. They tried to lie about it and say it was for the bloody mary, which was for the vegetarian at the table. They ended up comping our entire meal, which would usually be enough for me to forgo the bad review, but the experience was so dreadful that I would've rather paid more than deal with that."
"I'm on a business trip to Chicago and my wife and I are doing the whole 30, which means no sugars, gluten, legumes, alcohol, dairy. I hate having to be ""that guy"" of restaurants, but my man Connor behind the bar took such good care of me and asked the kitchen about all the ingredients. The Pork chop was delicious and I bought a rotisserie chicken to take home with me.   This is a great place with good food, good drink and excellent service. I highly recommend it."
"Dependable breakfast.  Don't expect much imagination here, they don't even try but that's not necessarily a bad thing either.  So many places overdo it with the foie gras stuffed french toast with goji berry compote and balsamic coulis beurre blanc concoctions.  That said, the food is delicious and heart warming although maybe a bit stingy with their bacon but that's a whiny complaint.  They allow dogs in the patio which is a plus!"
"Two words. WRIGHTWOOD SALAD Probably THE BEST salad I've ever eaten. Try it and if you don't like it, know there is something wrong with YOU, not the salad. Aside from the salad though, CK offers great courteous friendly staff. Wait is always long but you'll see why once you get a taste of their brunch, monkey bread & you guessed it- WW salad! It's fine though, as its location ( Southport Corridor) is the perfect place to walk around and window shop. Oh! And kids eat free daily from 4-7pm! Score."
"This place is ""not bad"" but ""not good"" here is why:- Rotisserie chicken is their expertise and chicken is moist but flavorless.-  Nothing really special about menu .. yes, Cornbread is good but I mean..it is    cornbread.  How much can you be excited about cornbread? (It was just meh for me)By all means. service is great, the place is clean, and they do not mess up the food. It is just flavorless overall and the menu is nothing special.  If you are okay with salt and peppering your food constantly (and you like just the plane salt and pepper), I guess it won't be that bad."
"The Resturant had a family atmosphere, I serious every table had a minimum of one kid, it wasn't like I didn't like it. The food was wonderful I hit the salmon with fries it was cooked just right my wife had the beef steak it was also wonderful. Don't leave the place with out trying the corn bread its a must try. The was packed but lucky us we arrived at about 5:30 it was a late lunch early dinner, but as soon as it became 6:15 people were standing waiting for tables to finish. One more thing the food didn't take long to cook 15 minutes max. I would go there again"
"Came here fwith a few friends and sat outside for a pleasant dinner.  We started off with the deviled eggs and that was delicious. An order was just enough for 3 people, although we could have had another oder between us without any problems.  I had the chicken sandwich dip which was delicious.  The fries are thin cut, crunchy, and also very good.  My other friend got a salad and enjoyed that well enough.  We didn't have time to enjoy dessert since a storm came in and we had to seek shelter from our outdoor seats.  Overall, this place isn't bad.  The food was good and the service was great.  It's a nice spot to go to if you're in the area and if you want to have a meal outdoors."
"This was my first time here.  The hostess was very friendly and efficient.  We shared the meatball recipe served with a rich beef gravy and topped with fried onions.  My main was the beef stroganoff.  Decent, it could have used a touch more sour cream.  We shared the chocolate chip skillet.  Very good, though it needed way more ice cream.  Very nice experience.  Our server was pleasant and efficient."
"This place gets a 4.5, if that were possible. I want to give a 5, but while I really have no complaints, I'm not sure I can just toss out a 5 so readily ...yet.The atmosphere was so nice. It had a relaxed, intimate feel, but was not crowded. Some places jam chairs and tables in every square inch, but I felt like the mix was perfect here.Let's get to what I'm most excited about ... the food. Truly, the appetizer was the shining star of the night, and it shined brighter than most because it was simple, yet so oh so amazing. We got the buttermilk biscuits with apple butter and whipped goat cheese. I KNOW! As if goat cheese couldn't possibly get any damn better, they did it. I was so excited to get the goat cheese, but then eating it even blew my expectations away. The biscuit was also amazing. It had a buttery, almost-fried taste, and it truly was the total package. Whoever came up with this deserves all of my stars and  a hug.I got the chicken dip sandwich and fries as my meal. This is probably where the lack of the 5th star comes in. The sandwich was good ... the chicken was roasted and moist, but the rest of the flavors just didn't wow me. Maybe it was because I was still on a high from the appetizer, but that isn't such a bad problem to have.The prices were great, too. I can definitely see myself coming back somewhat regularly!"
"The atmosphere is friendly, casual, and inviting. Service was very fast and we were seated quickly. The prices are a little high though 10 .00 for cheeseburger and fries. It did have a great neighborhood feel to it."
"Stopped in for brunch today, had to wait an hour for a table so had pretty high expectations. I had the Crosby omelet and would say it was just ok. Nothing too impressive, just tasted pretty standard. They also brought me my wrong meal out to begin with and the food runner ran off to quickly before I could say something. So it took us a bit to flag down the waitress to get the correct meal and also silverware for the table. They were really nice though, and rectified it quickly. So all in all an average experience, but I would be interested in maybe trying to out for lunch or dinner in the future as that part of the menu sounded pretty good."
"Came to Crosby's based on yelp reviews and was very, very pleased. Food was great (cornbread and burger). Our service was GREAT! Wish I could remember our waitress's name because she knew the menu and was super friendly.It was a great experience and I would definitely go back! Love the environment and their kitchen and staff seemed very efficient! A new favorite spot!"
"It was meh. I had the cornbread. It was a little ...not cooked well. the only way i could eat it was to slather the bread with the butter WHICH WAS HEAVENLY.I got the rotisserie chicken. it was ok. Nothing spectacular. I felt like i could have went to walmart and gotten one i actually would have raved about. Everything was just. Ok. Bland. I probably won't be going back. Or if i did, i would try something different"
"I can't say enough good things about Crosby's.  I've been here a bunch of times and have never been disappointed.  It has great ambiance, indoor and outdoor seating, a great staff and the food is awesome.If you're going for brunch, which I highly recommend, you might have to wait a little bit for a table, but it's worth every minute.  Besides, you can always wait for your table at the bar while sipping on a mimosa, specialty cocktail or any one of the many other spirits available.Everything I've ever had off their menu was delicious.  My favorite meal of theirs is brunch, and I'd recommend the Fried Egg Sandwich, any one of the omlettes (especially the Lakeview) and the Lobster Deviled Eggs.  And don't forget to try the Bloody Mary (with bacon!).  I don't even like Bloody Mary's that much and theirs is delicious! A must try!"
"Came for brunch.... there are many other places in the area to still try is my overall opinion.Food was fine, no complaints. Their hash browns are more of a casserole variety with what seems like a lot of butter and cream so be careful if you're lactose intolerant! My boyfriend and I ordered 2 different omelets which were fine.The complaint is the service. They brought other people's food to our table no less than 3 times and never apologized. When our meal did arrive, the person was not familiar with the brunch menu and could not tell me which omelette was which. She brought me a menu so I could figure out from the ingredients which omelette was mine..... Uhhh, huh?"
Love this place! Located a couple blocks from my apartment it's become a favorite spot. Only downfall is the 4-6 kids eat free... Last time I was there I was seated next to five kids screaming and pounding on the table.
"Came here for dinner and drinks with some friends, I wasn't too impressed we just got sandwiches and a cocktail. The chicken dip sandwich was pretty small for the price and tasted fine. Potato salad wasn't anything special. The cocktail I got was basically a Tom Collins with lemonade flavored alcohol. Again, just okay."
Such a fun place. Good for all ages. Sat at the bar and could watch the hawks and the Cubs. Love the lobster deviled eggs and cornbread. Drinking boulevard unfiltered wheat beer!-yum.  Ordered the grilled asparagus special- boring. Too many good things on the menu to get that again.
"Crosby's is my go to spot whenever I want to get food or brunch. Always take people who come and visit Chicago there. I love it  Brunch: this isn't your unlimited-mimosa-lets-drank kind of place. But the Blloody Mary's are excellent! Best one I've ever had. (Make sure to upgrade to add the bacon, too!) Anything on the brunch menu is delicious. I've tried the omletes, the signature dishes, and the salads. Great! Personal tip: anything with goat cheese in it is perfect for me. You MUST get the monkey bread. It's obviously gross in terms of calories and butter, but don't think about that. It's cinnamon sugar goodness. As far as dinner and lunch - again. Amazing as well. Staff is also attentive and personable. They are wear plaid shirts which helps.helps to pull in that down-to-earth-Southern vibe. HIGHLY recommended if in Southport Corridor and want to impress with good food."
"This place had a neat atmosphere: kind of rustic, but had a sports bar feel. Our waitress was friendly and attentive, and was patient when it took us forever to get around to ordering (chatty tables must be annoying but she handled us well). The menu wasn't super inspired or inventive, but the salad I ordered (the Wrightwood) was good. The chicken in it was excellent and the cornbread croutons added great texture and sweetness."
"My favorite casual dining experience in the city. short, but great beer list (LOVE old chub!), awesome salads (love the tuna salad) and the rotisserie chicken is very tasty. I have been many times, and my only complaint is that the mashed potatoes had a very strange plastic-y taste. Service is always what you'd hope for and there's a DELICIOUS African American server- he is truly hottt with multiple T's. Don't skip the cornbread app or the cookie skillet for dessert. Some of Chicago's best food at very fair prices. ILY, CK!"
"Crosby's Kitchen, it's not just for breakfast, anymore! Stealing a line from the Orange Juice Grower's of America, this review is for Crosby's stellar dinner service. My dining partner, Kirstin and I, were super stoked to try this place; and even moreso when we were told by a friend that P!nk was in the house. (She had apparently dined much earlier, but more on that later).Crosby's is really hopping in the evening, and there's not much of an area to wait, so a reservation is recommended. I love the look and feel of this place- the open main dining area has great energy, and the Southern Gothic art touches are nice- large artsy vegetable prints in chunky wood frames, an antique apothecary chest sunk into the wall, a gas fireplace- this place is hip in an understated way. You must try the Iron Skillet Cornbread appetizer. Sweet, fluffy, served in said skillet, a great rustic touch. When you're perusing the entrees, the Rottiserie ""Specials"" are only available on the nights listed. Whereas I thought it meant a price special, and was really excited to try the spice-crusted pork chop. Perhaps the word ""only"" could be added, as ""Tuesday Night Only"". - Pike Place BBQ Salmon- with a soy sauce glaze, this salmon was out of this world.- (Wood roasted) Chicken- incredible. moist. (I know we all hate that word, but it was!) Some of the best chicken I've ever had!Service was really great, which tips this to five stars. Our server was focused on providing great meal service to our section all night, and seemed really busy and focused. I wasn't really excited to dine with Pink- I'm not much of a star chaser, but we asked our server about her, and his eyes lit up! He waited on her early in the evening, and said she was a doll. And of course she was at Crosby's; it's classy, down to earth, and the food is amazing."
"I've been here a few times for brunch. I think about the biscuits on a regular basis. Yes, they are that good. Slight crunch on the outside, and warm, soft, delicious on the inside. Add the maple butter and you'll bliss out.Other food has been solid - excellent spicy hollandaise - and I keep meaning to go for dinner. I also really appreciate their staff. The hosts are really friendly and on their game, and they use this great NoWait app to keep things easy for everyone. Servers have been consistently good, responsive, and genuinely helpful. Seems to be a happy place. And efficient. The food comes out quickly, and the staff works together to keep things running.Kudos to Crosby's. Give it a try."
"I've been here several times and have never been disappointed! Good service and great food! I will say that their brunch is on point. The French toast is to die for! Still haven't tried the monkey bread but I'm sure it's delicious! Also, get a Bloody Mary."
"LOVE this neighborhood spot as it is within walking distance of where we live, the food and service are on par, and we can bring our 5 month old without getting dirty looks. From the moment we walked in, I was greeted happily and assisted immediately. There was a little bit of a wait, but they actually were able to seat us sooner than anticipated AND it didn't require our full party to be there. Which was nice for me and my friend and my baby to be able to get situated and order some wine while we wait for our husbands to arrive. The ambience is homey, but loud. Which we prefer now that we go to dinner with our 5 month old. The wait staff was knowledgeable, friendly and all together enjoyable to be around. A few recommendations were right on point by our waitress. We all ordered the rotissiere chicken meal in some form, and it was delicious!! As a dessert, we got the skillet cookie and I would climb a mountain to have that again. AMAZING. All the drinks we ordered were great - a red blend type wine (recommended), a rose (recommended), and two beers that both guys enjoyed. Lincoln Park/Lakeview need more places like this! Will definitely be returning."
"I never order turkey burgers-  not that I'm a big red meat fan, but not much can beat a classic burger-  except maybe Crosby's Turkey Burger...  It was kind of exceptional...I feel like there is always a line out the door of people waiting for tables and until now I never really got it.  There is ample space inside for larger groups, but if you're a group of 6 or less I'd recommend a sidewalk table.  (Obviously weather permitting). There is something so summer about sitting on a sidewalk that's trying to be a patio, drinking a beer, eating great food and being with friends.  It felt very St. Elmo's fire minus the drama of course.  Let's just say, it's cozy, it's cute, it's convenient and it's good."
"Pretty good spot. They are always busy and for good reason. Love the crabcakes, turkey burger, and brunch food."
"I live around the corner and was happy to finally try this cute place. Went here last night and overall great experience. I only took off one star due to the small menu selection. We came in around 8 and there was a 20 minute wait which I expected. Hostess was super friendly and took my name to text us when the table was ready. After a quick walk we were texted and seated right away. The atmosphere is awesome. The fireplace was on and it was bustling but not too loud. So cozy on a cold fall evening! My girlfriend kept commenting on the cute checked shirts the servers wore. We got the crab cake appetizer which was very tasty (I work at a high end seafood restaurant so I was ready to judge!) just the right size for two. Remoulade was great. My girlfriend got the half chicken, I tasted it and it was great. The mashed potatoes were so rich and flavorful. I got the burger which was very basic, I ordered it rare and was happy to find they cooked it really rare, exactly how I wanted it. The meat was very high quality. Grilled asparagus with lemon was yum. The key lime pie was so-so. A bit too rich and not super lime-y but a nice ending to the meal. I left full and happy. Our waiter was very friendly and kept the soft drinks/water filled without having to flag him down and the bussers were on point clearing plates. I work in management in fine dining, and I think this is an excellent and cozy neighborhood spot. I will definitely be back!"
"Highly recommend the cornbread skillet with maple butter.  The cornbread was such a hit, it inspired one of our dining guests to cue up this little clip immediately after we left Crosby's: youtube.com/watch?v=nmMT…This place is cute, and they have a well-rounded menu of comfort food.  My group stuck with breakfast goods - omelets with fruit, and cornbread (because we caught a glimpse of it from another table and had to have it). They have a small patio area for outdoor eating.  I'd definitely swing back for a casual meal sometime."
Went there with a group of 6 and had great service from a beautiful woman with a pretty smile! I've never had deviled eggs...and omg the Lobster Deviled Eggs were amazing. So glad I tried them. The monkey bread was good...but it got tough on top too quickly in my opinion. The blackened fish sandwich was seasoned perfectly and the jalapeño mayo? Fantastic. Delicious legit jalapeño taste.
"This place is pretty good! There Brussels sprout salad with the rotisserie chicken is so delicious. It's very fresh, the dressing is kinda citrusy and the fresh chicken with the shaved parm cheese...I'm a fan. I have also tried there deviled lobster eggs! Very good. Atmosphere is nice and service has always been great. We just recently tried there brunch and I was not that impressed. I will stick with dinner menu. Have been wanting to try the monkey bread but last time I was there they had just had a fire and it effected the stove that made it? That's what I was told. There wine menu is decent as well. This place is really cute in the summer. The patio is nice and southport is such a great street to view while eating. I recommend people to try it out."
"We love this place!  First off, the corn bread is completely awesome.  Must.Try.The.Cornbread.  They have a nice cocktail list, wine list and beer selection.I love the ambiance of the place.  I like that they we can bring our kids before 6pm and eat for free or we can go later and enjoy mostly a kid-free environment.  They cater to both groups very nicely. Kids eat for free before 6pm!The chicken is always moist and perfectly done.  I've not been disappointed. I've tried just about everything and haven't been disappointed.  I'd give this place 4 stars if they had a gluten free option for burgers and sandwiches, but alas, they do not.My review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the cookie skillet!  OMG.  It's to die for."
"Cute upscale neighborhood restaurant that serves up a cornbread with maple butter that is essentially like starting out your meal with a cake. I highly recommend ordering this for the table the minute you get seated. So.freaking.good. Cornbread aside, their menu offers up something for everyone - salads, burgers, sandwiches, and meat from their rotisserie. The veal brisket stroganoff won the contest on a cold night, and was rich and satisfying. So, for your cold winter pre-Jeni's nights (because you can still eat Jeni's in the winter time - YES YOU CAN), come here for some comforting dinner. Sit close by (but no by) the fireplace (or you'll roast), and you can have a cozy Southport Corridor dinner, complete with all the families and children surroundings that you could possibly want, and cornbread in a skillet that will chase away all your winter blues."
"This is one of the most kid friendly restaurants in this area.  We have been here several times with our son and it is so nice to go to a restaurant with other loud kids.  Kids get crayons and a menu to color.  Kids also eat free 4 to 6 every day!!  Winning!!  We always luck out and get really great waiters!   This place has the BEST turkey burger I have ever ever had in my life!  If you order it, I promise you will not be disappointed! !   It has some Asian spices and marinating sauce which are amazing!  I had fries with it and that made the perfect meal.  Their fries are skinny and crunchy and oh so yummy!  My husband had a cheeseburger with the potato salad.  The potato salad was good and different.   The cheeseburger was just okay especially when I have the turkey burger to compare it to.  Before all of that deliciousness came to our table, we tried the lobster deviled eggs....nom nom nom!!!  We ordered a skillet cookie to go because we were full and because if a restaurant has a skillet cookie, you order a skillet cookie!!!  Love this place!"
"Went there for brunch and it was delicious..wish we would have tried the monkey bread, it looked amazing"
"This is a great place to grab dinner and drinks with a small group of friends!Very reasonably priced and the kitchen delievers some phenomenal dishes.  My go-to's are the Filet of Beef and the Sashimi Tuna salad.  Whatever is on special here is typically ""Special"" and is never a wrong direction to take!  Don't skip the cornbread!Only downside: how busy this place can get!  Also, sometimes it seems like a McDonalds Playplace with the number of kids that are here."
"This is our GO TO restaurant in our 'hood. But I'd travel here even if it wasn't close by! The food is amazing. The Wrightwood Salad and Turkey Burger are my go-to's. I don't eat pork but my husband loves the pork chops. The staff is so friendly. We sit at the bar often and the bartenders are all great. It's a very homey, comfortable atmosphere. Especially with the rotisserie going. Great patio for people watching. Very kid friendly too. They do take reservations but if you walk in during prime time, you may have to wait...it's worth the wait!"
"Very, very nice staff. Drinks were just okay. Very warm and welcoming, and a beautiful space. The biggest problem for me was getting ice cold mashed potatoes with a $32 prime rib. Not sure if returning... For the prices, there is better out there."
"I loved everything about this place. Food, service, environment - it was all great. We ordered the biscuit appetizer. The combination of goat cheese/rhubarb jam was heavenly. The brussel sprout salad was wonderful, and chicken dip sandwich was a great combo of flavors. I also appreciated that we told the waitress we were sharing, and the meals came out already split. (A small touch that made me a happy diner.)The space is smartly designed. You can tell the restaurant designer put thought into the decor, as the artwork is lovely and appropriate for the space. Three bathrooms exist - one for men, one for women, and one for men or women (with a changing table). Our waitress was delightful, offering suggestions when asked. The restaurant tends to be a bit loud with many families and children in the early evening, so probably not ideal for a romantic night out (until maybe a little later). But, we didn't mind. If I were to be nit-picky, I would suggest putting a few more toppings on the brussel sprout salad (the nuts and raisins were a little sparse). Additionally, I'd suggest slicing the chicken on the sandwich so it's a bit more manageable. However, this were very  minor things in what was an overall great dining experience. I can't wait to return."
"Wonderful new gem that has popped up on Southport. Comfort food with a fancy twist, and a less than comfortable price at times, but is easily made up for by the sheer satiating power of the dishes they create.All of it, all of it is wonderful. Have I only sampled the Burger and crab cake appetizer the five times I've been there? Yes. Does that mean I subsequently can't make a claim that vast about the rest of the menu based on only having tried two items? Possibly. However, if Burgers and Crab cakes are any indication of total and overall quality of a restaurant's fare...as it rightly should be, then Crosby's Kitchen serves nothing but pure, unadulterated, gold. (as in food, not real gold)Staff is friendly and prompt as well. (Shout out to the waitress whom we told we would give a shout out to on yelp, and then forgot your name) :)"
I came right before they were about to close so not many customers were there at the time. Burgers were nice and juicy (recommend ordering medium). Atmosphere was laid back and they were playing good music. Cool place.
"Smoked salmon appetizer = amazing! So fresh All our food was great ! We had the smoked salmon as well as cornbread Brussels sprout salad, turkey burger, and fish sandwich.. With shoestring fries yum! Warm friendly environment.. Very cozy Will be back"
"Had a great lunch here on a nice sunny day. We sat inside but the large open windows let in a good breeze. I had the strawberry salad and cornbread skillet and both were excellent. The cornbread skillet is enough for 2-3 people so be prepared! My only problems were that their menu is small and does feel somewhat limiting, and the service was also extremely slow."
"We came here for Brunch this morning. I have been here for dinner, so I was curious about the brunch. It's great that this place takes reservations, because the wait was 1.5hrs. Our server was very attentive and helpful at picking the right options. If you're a fan of monkey bread (which is a popular item here), you should make sure to come early, because by noon it was 86'd.The mimosa's were par for the course. Nothing special to write home about. I myself had the Wrightwood salad, which is so good, and a huge portion for the price. Another person in my party had the Chicken Hash, which was very tasty. The other two people in my party had the Bacon Strata Benedict, which on paper seemed delicious. However to the plate it didn't quite translate. The eggs were cooked perfectly, however the menu advertised buttermilk biscuits, but it was served on some sort of very thick bacon cornbread. Definitely wasn't the same biscuit that was served with the hash. It was a dense consistency which the people in my party did not care for. I'm not sure if the kitchen was out of biscuits or if it was just an error. The skillet cookie at the end was really amazing. If you're a fan of cookies (who isn't?) you need to get this. The server after the issue with the Benedict took it off our bill and was able to get us something more to our tastes. A+ for hospitality.All in all I would definitely come back here again for brunch and dinner. The atmosphere is great and the food is also 99% of the time pretty good."
"The fare says american, but this is straight up comfort food, which really isn't my thing.  Although the service was good, the food was just ok.  For an appetizer we got the chips and guacamole.  The amount of guacamole was so ridiculously small that it wasn't enough for a party of 2.  I got the crab cakes and they were a bit dry.  The sauce that went with them made it, but it shouldn't have to be that way.  Fries were tiny and shoe string which also isn't a favorite of mine.  Overall decent atmosphere, average food and a bit overpriced.  Will not return but more because I don't care for this style of food."
"Came for Saturday brunch at this spacious, quaint restaurant. It was fairly packed with Southporters (girlz and families mainly). My favorite two things I had here were the blood mary and the special that day, the monkey bread. The blood mary was dreamy because it came with a thick fatty piece of bacon, a skewer of cherry tomato, salami, pickle, and green olive. BUT, above all, it came with a little baby sidecar of Miller. That is what every bloody mary should aspire to when they grow up. For the meal, I had the goat cheese veggie omelette. It was ok. Also chose potatoes as a side. At Crosby, their potatoes are made kind of like creamy rosemary hashbrown casserole. Also, on another potato related note, one of the sides options are also these fried bacon potato pancakes (shaped like hockey pucks). I tried a friend's and they were pretty tasty. Great option for brunch if you're in the area!"
Had the opportunity to go there with family (8 adults) before seeing a show. The waitress was just simply amazing- not only did we get our food in plenty of time but she kept all our drinks filled and checked on us constantly. For me it was the turkey burger and it shined with the Asian slaw along with awesome fries. Tried the corn bread appetizer which was great (nice and warm) my wife's chicken dip- WOW! Very highly recommended. The bill wasn't bad either and well worth the experience. A definite will be there again restaurant
"This visit met all of our expectations based upon earlier Yelp reviews.  The highlights of this meal included the crab cake app (real crab & fresh & pan-seared), the Wrightwood salad (fresh interesting & diverse ingredients), and the salmon entree (tasty & plump).  All of this was served by a friendly staff while the managers/owners presence was clearly felt--always a nice touch."
Not that Crosby's needs another review.  They have the best turkey burger! And the brussels sprouts are amazing if you can catch them on a day serving them!
"We walked in without reservations on a Friday eve with our family of 5. We were seated right away and had great service throughout our meal. The spinach dip, crab-cakes and turkey burgers were all awesome. Our drinks actually tasted like they had alcohol in them:)."
"You know you're a true Chicagoan when you're still willing to dine al fresco in 40 degree weather because you refuse to accept that winter is coming.Brunch is lovely here.  Get their kicky bloody mary, and add on bacon! I am also a sucker for monkey bread so of course ordered that in addition to my stuffed french toast.  Yup, I would totally fail paleo.Bonus Points: They take reservations for brunch!"
"Great food, but a lot of kids in there for Valentine's Day"
"I came here with some extended family and had a great experience! Four adults and one toddler can be a handful for any waiter (and dining neighbors) but ours did very well. We started off with the cornbread and a brussel sprout salad to share as our apps. The cornbread came out in a cast iron skillet and was tasty, but the brussel sprout salad was delicious! I ordered a chicken salad of sorts for my entree and it didn't Ben compare to the tastiness of the brussel sprout salad. It is the kind of dish that would make anyone a lover of brussel sprouts. Other dishes ordered were the crab cakes and sautéed spinach, some herbed pork chops off the roaster and a cheeseburger. Everyone finished their plates. Yummy stuff! I just wasn't as impressed with my chicken salad as I thought I would be so I can't give this five stars. The atmosphere was nice, the server was friendly and the food was good. I'd definitely recommend this place. And if you like lamb, go on Fridays!"
"I hope I don't end up pregnant after eating here.I'm not sure what's in the water in Southport Corridor, but I'm not exaggerating when I say that every single table in this place had one or more kids, women visibly pregnant, or women who looked as if they were about to give birth after the appetizers were served. Whoa, peeps be some Fertile Myrtles in this 'hood.Anyway, that's neither here nor there...I'm here to talk about the food. CK is owned and operated by the same folks who own Dunlay's, Frasca, and Smoke Daddy, so there's some menu crossover. Crosby's has several rotisserie items on their menu, including a nightly special, as well as chicken, which is offered every day.We started with lobster deviled eggs and smoked salmon. I was pretty disappointed with the deviled eggs. Way too much mayo and the lobster was very finely minced so very little lobster flavor came through. I kinda felt like I was eating cat food. The smoked salmon was fine. Nothing remarkable; we didn't finish it (but speaking of cats, we took the rest home and our kitties devoured it).For our entrees, I had the rotisserie chicken which came with scallion mashed potatoes, and he had the halibut, which was the fish special. Both were good, but nothing we couldn't get elsewhere or that we would go out of our way to eat again.I also thought our meal was rather pricey for being a ""neighborhood"" place. Two appetizers, two entrees, and two beers, plus tax and tip, came in at just under $100. I can think of much better meals I've enjoyed for far less money.Our server was really upbeat and very knowledgeable. He was so animated and ""on;' he'd be better off in a less-casual establishment. Crosby's is indeed A-OK; nothing to keep me rushing back, but I can see why it's busy.If you're in the mood for decent American food and/or looking to get knocked up, I'd say Crosby's is right up your alley."
Make sure and call ahead to get your name on the list!  The monkey bread was amazing and try the fried egg sandwich mmmmmm
This is my one of my favorite places on southport. Don't leave without trying the cast iron corn bread!
"I met a friend here for brunch at 11 on a beautiful fall Saturday, and I think we waited about 15 minutes or so.  So not a bad choice in that regard!  The hosts were friendly and attentive, letting us know ""we're just cleaning off your table now"" and generally keeping the crowd from getting too restless.  There are definitely a lot of babies here, but also plenty of young couples and groups of guys and girls waiting to watch football.  They have a long bar with a few TVs, the overall space has lots of windows providing sunlight, and I think there's a fireplace on one side so the vibe is cozy.My friend picked the spot because she said they had amazing bloody Marys.  She ordered one and it came with a little half beer thingy (a beer back? I don't know, I don't drink Bloody Marys) and a skewer of pickle, cheese, tomato, salami, and something else.  Looked pretty delicious actually.  Like lunch.  I got a mimosa which was surprisingly not sweet.  They say they use fresh juice and I believe them, but perhaps the champagne they use is really dry, But the overall taste was a little more bitter than I'd hoped.I got the eggs florentine, which is toasted brioche topped with a slice of smoked turkey, two poached eggs, and a drizzle of hollandaise.  This is all over a bed of spinach and I got fruit on the side.  The dish was just okay - the eggs were poached perfectly and I liked the bread.  Meat was pretty salty and I wish there was more hollandaise.  I guess it's healthier without but would've been tastier with!  And I think serving it over a bed of raw spinach was just sort of...weird.  If the spinach had been cooked or more integrated into the dish I think that'd be better.  As it was, it was sort of a garnish and the raw flavor didn't really add much to the dish.  The fruit was generic melon/pineapple fruit cup mix, and some of it was kind of soft around the edges, not as fresh tasting.Anyway I think it has a great comfy atmopshere, but my food was still pretty average.  These are the same people who own D.O.C. and Dunlay's and Frasca and there are some menu repeats.  The place reminds me of Dunlay's on Clark.  But food quality is better at Frasca!"
"We had a wonderful experience here today. Most especially because we had such an awesome waitress, Emily. We have had her many times, and always enjoy our visit. She's the best! Thanks for a great time!"
"I love everything about this place! It has both indoor and outdoor seating which is always nice, and they take reservations.Now, on to more important things...the food! If you like cornbread, you need to experience this place. It is to die for--it has a hint of jalapeno and comes with maple butter. It's a party in your mouth! I would probably give the restaurant 5 stars for that alone, but I have tried a number of other things on the menu (crab cakes, Wrightwood salad, french toast), and all of it is really good!This is my new go-to place to eat, and what I love is that it's good for brunch, lunch and dinner."
"This place is rad.  There is indoor and outdoor seating and they do take reservations. Food wise... Bloody Mary was awesome and had salami, cheese, olives, deliciousness in it.  For an extra buck you get a slice of bacon.  If you don't get that, you're a shitty person.The eggs florentine was delicious, too.All around awesome brunch."
"First time here and my fiancé and I had a delighted time. The only downfall is we didn't have reservations, so we had to wait 30-45 mins (probably because we wanted to sit outside on this beautiful spring day and PEOPLE WATCH LOL!). Apps: MUST GET! 1) Iron skillet corn bread with maple butter2) Lobster deviled eggs*I promise, you won't be disappointed. Entrees: Hers - Brusselsprout SaladHis - Chicken dip sandwich with fries (Au jus)Service was good. Prices are expensive and made for rich hipsters with children, but the food was phenomenal."
"I've been here a few times and each time was really happy with the quality and taste of the food and the friendly, not-fake server. The ambiance is a huge part of the experience, too. It's a perfect mix of traditional and fancy without coming across like Logan Square (sorry). They were just as welcoming when I came with one person and we got only tea, as when I came with 6 people who all ordered food and drinks.I give 4 or 4.5 stars for the food (gotta keep something in reserve, right?), but I enthusiastically give 5 for the overall experience and I will be coming back here again (and again and again) and have recommended to friends.Good foods so far: Chicken dip sandwich, bread pudding, biscuits with an apple butter situation, mint tea, fries."
"Ever been to frasca? This is basically the same place. Same ownership, so food and menu are similar. Monkey and corn bread are very good along with rest of food.  Stroller city and prices are a bit high but if that doesn't bother you this is a solid brunch spot."
"My favorite brunch in the whole city. The food is always excellent. My favorite is the southport omelet with egg whites and the Nutella French toast. I've only made it in time for the monkey bread once, because it sells out so quickly. I can't forget to mention the Bloody Mary! Love my bloodies with a salad on top and a hand grenade of High Life. Perfect!Only reason for 4/5 is that it gets really congested on the weekends. Caters to families, but I find myself bumping into a stroller every time I move my chair."
"This is my go-to restaurant for brunch, lunch, dinner, drinks. Walking home after work and smelling the rotisserie chickens is just too much sometimes. Really solid menus and a good place for a date or a group meal. You might trip over a stroller or five but the best bloody mary you've had will more than make up for that. Their specials are always great but you can't go wrong with the wrightwood salad or their chicken dip sandwich. The breakfast potatoes are out of this world. I'm not a huge soup person but I've really liked both kinds I've had there. Also I just really like the rustic feel of the place, the prices are good, and there are TVs for your boyfriend that doesn't ever stop watching sports (or is that just mine?).."
"Crosby's Kitchen is great! The monkey bread sweet with cinnamon and frosting glaze is delicious and is only served on the weekends. The blood Mary's are seasoned just right and the Lakeview omelette is yummy:) My only complaint would be regarding the hollandaise covered omelette. I'm not sure if I just don't like hollandaise (it was my first time trying it) but it tasted like pennies to me. Besides that, much love to Crosby's. Keep slinging that fantastic cornbread too:)"
"The Food:Skillet cornbread = delicious.  It comes out hot, still in the skillet, with a side of butter, and oh oh oh, baby, you are just way too excited over some frickin' bread.The lady ordered a chicken sandwich, and it was completely and utterly tasty.  The atmosphere:Rather ""Up North"" like.  This may be a Michigander term... hmmm, it conveys a rustic type feeling.  Service:On point!  I was drinking with a friend for about an hour, he left, waiter cashed me out and cleaned my table for me, then my fiance arrived.  There was a period where I was sitting there by myself for about 30 min and he was only mildly annoyed, so I call it a win. (He probably wasn't  annoyed, but I think I would be annoyed, so it was probably just some mild projection).The Drinks:Their version of a Manhattan is terrific.  That's the only thing I had, but I had 3 of them, and I was well and thoroughly sauced.  The 4 Stars:The food choices were extremely limited....as in, they have a small menu.  Plus, I saw a couple pics here on Yelp of a fish sandwich, but that was no longer on the menu, and it was the sole reason I went there.  Wah wah wah, cry me series of tributaries leading to a body of water.Cheeers."
"Who doesn't love brunch and your neighborhood Crosby? The wait staff is really friendly and split our plates rather than us sharing off each other. If you're in the mood for lunch over brunch, your options are limited to burgers or a sandwich. We did love our Wrightwood Salad and the portion was perfect sharing. with our chicken sandwich.Be prepared to wait a bit for a seat, but on the bright side, you can call ahead and make a reservation."
"This is a very nice, family style restaurant with an upscale setting. On weekends it can get a little packed so expect to wait a little bit for a table. In my experience, the best time to visit Corsby's is for lunch during the weekday.  The restaurant has a pretty good selection of everything from roast chicken dinner to burgers. Seating is also pretty comfortable.  I think what impresses me the most is their staff.  A lot of restaurants near the Lakeview and Lincoln Park area can have a snooty feel. Not this restaurant. They are genuinely very upbeat and friendly.  This spot also has a full bar.  Prices are also very reasonable when you consider the quality and portions of food you get.   I'll be coming again."
"A wonderful restaurant!  In the past four weeks we've eaten lunch at Crosbys twice and has positively NOT disappointed. The deviled egg app and skillet cornbread are marvelous. The rotisserie chicken is juicy, tener and wonderland flavor!  The service from when we entered until we left was gracious and accommodating!  You should really try!  I've heard that dinner is also spectacular!2/28/2015: Just ate dinner and it was as good as lunch!  Deviled eggs, cornbread for apps and veal stroganoff and prime rib for entrees. Gracious and helpful server.  A great neighbor restaurant that's worth driving to!"
We went here for Brunch on the 4th of July Weekend and I have been craving it ever since. The eggs benny special was poached eggs on the CK cornbread with spicy bacon hollandaise sauce and it was outstanding. Order the Bloody Mary with cucumber vodka and you will not be disappointed. We took the Monkey Bread to go and reheated a couple hours later....delicious fuel for our food coma.
"Nice place. Good, consistent food & service. I love the goat cheese appetizer."
"beautiful restaurant, very good service- especially being a busy, thursday night. however, the menu selection is disappointing (drink menu is nice, though) there are countless other places with an incredible selection of dishes close by that are so much cheaper. the hamburger AND veggie burger are the same price... really? the pricing just struck me as odd.too expensive for what's to offer. nothing to write home about."
"Very impressed!One way to judge the quality of the food when you go out is simply ""would I have made this better in my own home?""...and the answer at Crosby's is an overwhelming ""no way""...the food is really that good here.  Very thankful for a great brunch today...the sandwiches were great, the rotisserie chicken was fantastic too.Kudos!"
"Loved this place. I'll be honest, when I first sat down and looked at the menu I was concerned that I wouldn't like anything. The descriptions just didn't sound THAT great to me and the menu is pretty short. However, they turned me around realllllll fast. The brussel sprout salad was honestly one of the best salads I've ever had. Such a perfect combo of ingredients and a delicious, light & refreshing dressing. Also, the grilled artichoke appetizer was so good. Perfectly seasoned and the remoulade was awesome. The restaurant itself has a wonderfully cozy feel (I was thrilled to be seated close to a fake fireplace, as it was very cold out!) and you can see them roasting tons of meat in the kitchen. Service was a little annoying- kept pestering us to order at first, despite us saying we planned to take our time (there was no one waiting for our table), then once we ordered it was next to impossible to get her to come back over for more drinks/the bill. All around a great neighborhood spot, though, and the service issue wasn't bad enough to warrant a star off."
"Cute decor, decent service, slightly above-par food. Nothing to write home about, especially with so many great restaurants in that area. I felt like I was at a fancy Applebee's."
"Pretty good place.  A bit pricy for  someone in their early 20s, but a nice atmosphere. I went with a couple of friends one afternoon for dinner, and we split the iron skillet cornbread (a delicious must-have, never had better cornbread).Each of us then had the chicken dip sandwich, and we were all fairly satisfied. Tasted quite good. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you never have."
"Everything we ordered was amazzzzing! From the deviled eggs to the salad, salmon, chicken, biscuit.. So good! Only compliant would be the seating and how noisy it is in there. We waited for a booth and it was ok, but still noisy of families"
"We ate here recently while visiting some family in Chicago - it is one of their go-to restaurants, and I can see why. The restaurant has a great casual vibe and a varied menu selection. It was a nice night, and even though the outdoor seating was full, they had all the large windows open to create indoor-outdoor seating.  The atmosphere was perfect!To start, we shared guacamole and the iron skillet corn bread. The guacamole was good, but I felt the portion was a bit small to be shared among 4 people.  Probably better suited for 2. I cannot say enough about the corn bread - it was fantastic!!! I could have eaten an entire skillet for my meal and walked away satisfied.For my entree, I ordered the Wrightwood salad.  It was good, but I didn't love the chicken.  I found it a bit slimy - sort of a bummer since it looks like the rotisserie chicken is a staple of their menu.  You can even see it cooking from the bar - turning on the spits back in the kitchen.  My husband got the chicken dip sandwich, and he seemed to enjoy it, but I probably wouldn't order chicken next time."
Ok chicken nothing special bland not seasoned very much and ordered the corn bread skillet and it was cold odd because it was served in a SKILLET???? Service and atmosphere pretty good nice people nothing great about the food.
"Monkey Bread.  Have you ever had anything as mouth wateringly delicious as Monkey Bread?  Has your grandmother ever made anything close to it's sweet, gooeyness?  In a word, No.My parents were in town for the weekend and we were looking for a place to eat before heading to Guthrie's Tavern for some board game competition.  I heard great things about Crosby's and figured it was as good of time as ever to give it a try.Our server was delightful, and pushed us in the direction of Monkey Bread.  How could we refuse when she described it as a clump of gooey cinnamon buns in a steel skillet.  Um, okay.  I was feigning for a bloody mary, and there's was perfect, topped off with a slice of bacon (bacon is optional of course, but who ARE you if you deny bacon....besides a vegetarian/vegan).My boyfriend went for the Salmon Tarragon Benedict special which was out of this world, and I opted for a traditional breakfast of eggs, turkey, and fruit (I have a trip to Mexico on the horizon and those sticky buns of godliness were enough calories to ruin me for the week - cut me some slack).  Note: when you see turkey as a breakfast meat option, they mean turkey....like turkey cut off the breast during Thanksgiving turkey, ok?  No, not turkey bacon.  Nope, not turkey sausage.  Straight up turkey.  And that was fine by me but perhaps others may find it to be an odd choice for breakfast.  Overall, we had a great lunch, in a great neighborhood, with a great server.  Great, great, great.  And three greats = five stars.  Trust me."
"I'm not sure why this isn't a 5 star review. I have no complaints and my food was great. Prices are fair and as a bar they have a great selection. As an eatery I guess my only problem is that there's not a lot to choose from. But for what there is, it's great.  When I say there's not a lot of choices I mean it basically has many variations of burgers, omelets and then a bunch of side options here and there that all sound promising and delicious. The sangria is just okay but the bloody is pretty great, according to my 4 friends that ordered it. The pricing is fair and the atmosphere is awesome. Crosby's, you are awesome, you just need to give me more choices. I recommend this place to everyone, you won't be disappointed.  BTW I had Brussels sprouts and smoked salmon. YUM."
"In the one month we've lived in the Southport area we've eaten here 5 times. I think that tells you what you need to know about this place.Yes the menu is a bit limited but what they do they do extremely well. If you want a huge menu with lots of choices filled with mediocre food go to a chain restaurant as this is not your place. Over the course of our culinary adventures here, I think we've had just about everything on the menu. Particularly noteworthy are the rotisserie items of the day (they change). We've had the ribs, chicken, double pork chop and each one was better than the rest (although pork chop I think is my favorite). Also have a great veggie burger that's more than just your run of the mill soy patty. It's got all sorts of stuff in it including walnuts if my wife's taste buds were correct.Apps are also varied but interesting. The cornbread is to die for. The grilled artichoke awesome and the smoked salmon (even though I hate smoked salmon) made a salmon lover out of me. Amazing.Add to this a super friendly staff and a patio you can bring your dogs onto and it's a winner. A bit more than if you were to pick up a sandwich at Potbelly across the street but you actually do get a quality meal instead of paying the same for something just blah...These are the types of neighborhood places we've all got to support as we want them to succeed and expand their culinary creations. So what are you waiting for? Go on, get there now!"
Great neighborhood restaurant! Great food and great atmosphere keeps us coming back.
"Just bad overall. Chicken fingers should be good no matter where you get them, they are huge but so breaded and have no flavor. Fries were cold. The cornbread skillet has potential but was nothing special. And it is just over priced- we had a salad and 3 kids meals and total was $65 with tip. We go to dunlays (same owner) every once in a while out of convenience but are disappointed every time with the food and pricing - no need for it to be so pricey when food isn't good.Staff was really nice but definitely not going back."
"Came here for a hungover Saturday brunch.  Having recently moved to the neighborhood, it was my first experience.  There was about a 20 minute wait for a table outside, so decided to grab a couple of seats at the bar that were open. The bartender, I forgot his name, was great and on top of everything, but the food was kind of lackluster.  Started with chips and guac before brunch items and was very disappointed.  For $10 you get this small ice cream scoop of guacamole but a giant mound of chips.  The dip to chip ratio is way off, either provide more guac or lessen the chips.  I had the Strata Benedict and my friend had the breakfast sandwich.  He said his was so so, nothing to write home about.  My benedict which i was extremely excited for, was a thumbs down.  One egg was perfectly poached, the other was over cooked.  The biscuits had no flavor and too big of a piece for the the size of the portion.  Everything lacked seasoning and the whole dish was very bland.The fruit on the side we got was obviously cut the day before and soggy.  Also the amount of honey dew in it was the shitty amount of honey dew.  I understand keeping costs down and melons are good fillers, but berries are in season now and i wouldn't mind a couple strawberry slices in there to equal out the ratio of mostly honey dew and cantaloupe with maybe 2 pieces of brown pineapple.  I believe in its the little thing that matters kind of approach, and the fruit side is my little thing. All in all I was expecting much better since the place is always packed, I am sure I will try it again though."
"Overall our experience was good. It was a cold, wintry night when we popped in. The restaurant is cozy with a homey atmosphere. I had the Wrightwood Salad which showed how good their rotisserie chicken is. Loved it! And you definitely need to try the cornbread. I was trying to be good but my friends ordered it... And how could I pass it up?"
This is definitely one of our favorite places for lunch or dinner. I strongly suggest you go when they have the pork chop special. It's like a juicy rack of pork perfectly done  with just the right amount of crispy goodness. The grilled artichoke superb. Order the lobster deviled eggs. Yum yum yum.
"This it SUCH a great place for brunch. We started off with the Iron Skillet Cornbread which is served with maple butter and the flavor is out of this world. I ordered the Southport Omete which is made with goat cheese, red peppers, artichokes, and asparagus and my friends got the Wood Roasted Chicken Hash. We all absolutely loved our meals. One of my friends got a bloody mary and said it was pretty top notch.  Overall the atmosphere is fun and the food is delicious. I highly recommend this place."
I have lived in Chicago for a little over a year and when we were first looking for places to live we came across Crosbys. I am so glad we did! We go at least once or twice a month. I love everything about Crosbys. From the staff to the wonderful atmosphere to the deliciously amazing food. Make sure you go for brunch because that's my favorite. The French toast is delicious. But the bacon potato cakes are out of this world. You have to get them! The chicken dip sandwich is so good too! Be careful because it does get really busy on the weekend. I've waited over an hour for a table just because I was craving their food! If you're in the area you have to go!
"I love the fact that in Chicago we have so many different neighbourhoods to explore, sure the ones I go to may be fairly similar but they offer a different streetscape to dine/shop in. We were dog sitting for some friends who live just west of the Southport Corridor and staying at their house which gave us an opportunity to enjoy the area. Saturday night dinner in a new part of town we thought, where do we go? The girl had heard some good things about Crosby's Kitchen so that was the direction we headed in and boy were we happy that was the choice. Food - After hearing about the menu from our server we settled on the Wrightwood Salad and the Rotisserie Chicken with asparagus on the side. We casually mentioned that we were going to try each others entrée out , our server took the time to note it and bring the Wrightwood out split on separate plates. Thanks for listening. Chicken was moist and the skin had a delicious blend of spices rubbed into it with a pleasing flavor for sure. Salad was HUGE and chock full of goodness.Service - fantastic, see above, as well as being attentive without being annoying. Ambiance - Pleasant, nice seat outside on Southport. Due to the Hawks playing we were seated right away and there was little foot/car traffic. Aside from the young successful looking you lady sitting at the table next to us that felt the need to punctuate her conversation with the F-Bomb it was a great evening dining alfresco. Quite delicious, will be back for sure."
Great neighborhood restaurant with classic drinks (whiskey drinkers should try the Grace Kelly / margarita for the salt rimmed deliciousness / Bloody Mary with bacon for brunch goers). Lobster rolls and Brussels sprout salad were amazing.. As was the salmon appetizer. Yum-diggity.
"Two words: cookie skillet.I've been here several times, and I am always very happy with the food and service. Highly recommended for brunch, lunch, and dinner!"
"Stopped in for a bite because we were in the neighborhood, and this seemed the best option at the time. It was early dinnertime-ish, like 6pm. The inside was crowded, so we opted to sit outside, with the request that we get seated out of the blazing sun. Our wish was granted, we avoided a wait time, got a shady table with an umbrella on the patio.Service was attentive but not overbearing. My water was never empty, and the server was familiar with the menu and was able to answer questions.I had the chicken sandwich which was delightful. Nice bread that was the right size and did not fall apart, tender chicken and cheezy goodness. What's not to like? The other half had a burger. Solid choice, cooked as requested. Think cut fries were tasty and not burnt - yea.Really nice restrooms, but I wish there were more of them.I want to come back and try more. Everything they brought out looked good."
"Delicious! My family and I had brunch here this past weekend, and it did not disappoint. We started off with the monkey bread. I am from the South and have had a LOT of monkey bread throughout my life...this was by far some of the best! I highly recommend it. We devoured it.It was only 10 am but I had read so much about the Wrightwood Salad that I had no choice but to order it. It was fantastic. One of the best salads I've had in a very long time. The goat cheese and cornbread croutons were amazing, as was the citrus vinaigrette. We did not have to wait at all, but I ran past the restaurant again around 12 pm and it was packed. Plan accordingly! I see frequent trips to Crosby's Kitchen in the future."
"I decided to give this place a second chance since it's so close to home, bad decision.  My son had a hamburger which was OK, but nothing spectacular.  I had the chicken dip sandwich which was also fell far short of amazing.  Now this is where I have the real problem, so I told the waitress that I wanted lettuce instead of arugula because I have recently identified (or thought I had) arugula as a flavor I don't care for due to the bitterness.  She convinced me that it is not bitter so I decided to give it a try (why she was so concerned that I eat the arugula I will never know).  Lo and behold, when the sandwich came it was loaded with bitter tasting arugula.  I brought this to this server's attention and she offered to get me some lettuce, hello!?!? I don't want lettuce now, I'd just like to not have to pick soggy arugula out of melted cheese with my hands.  Too late!  She didn't offer to make any adjustment to the bill or any other concession.  The bill was like $27, I gave her $40.  She asked if I needed change....No, please just have a $13 tip for the awful service and f-ed up sandwich...what planet are you from??  She came back with a $10 bill and three $1 bills.  Sorry, again, you're not getting a $10 tip on this bill just because you failed to give me proper change so I could leave a reasonable tip.  Another note, they make their employees wear these weird outfits with most of the females clad in poorly fitting skinny jeans and plaid shirts.  Guys can wear regular pants apparently.  Strange.Oh, we also had the cornbread which was pretty good, but a little bit of an odd flavor when you've got jalapeño pepper in the bread and spread honey butter on it.  It wasn't really that hot, they try to play it like it just came out of a piping hot oven, but I understand that due to the necessary cooking time of 20-30 minutes for cornbread that they can't reasonably bake each one fresh so I can't gripe too much about that, but it certainly could have been warmer.  Also, the steamed veggies I ordered as a side were inedible due to the odd addition of some powdered cheese and a horrible seasoning mixture.  Absolutely awful!  I mean usually steamed vegetables are just that, sometimes a little butter, or salt, but never grated/powdered cheese and awful herbs.  Come on now!Most of their menu items seem a bit overpriced as well.  I mean $9 for three halves of lobster deviled eggs?  $8 for buttermilk biscuits?? Please!!  This isn't Alinea here.  I'm pretty sure that I will never set foot in this place again.  I can't understand why this place is still in business."
"This feels like a good place to bring out of towners; Crosby's Kitchen is an inviting place to have brunch with a plethora of wide windows and deep booths. Although it always feels busy I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes to be seated- which in my book is a plus as I usually avoid weekend brunches like the plague for this reason. In fact, I discovered this cozy restaurant when I was waiting for a seat at the Southport Grocery.While the menu selection isn't extensive I find that they have a little bit of everything so that no matter what you're in the mood for there's likely to be something to satiate your appetite.The employees are friendly and it's very kid friendly if you're looking for a place to bring your little ones. If it happens to be a (rare) pleasant day the surrounding neighborhood offers window shopping galore.I've been here three times and intend to come back."
"Most of what I have to say has been said in one form or another. So here goes:People/strollers/babies/kids everywhere. We went on a saturday at noon so, par for the course. You pretty much know what you're getting into if you have brunch on this strip of Southport.A pretty long wait, no matter what. We were quoted with ""20 minutes"" but ended up being closer to 40. Just for context, I called Southport Grocery while we were waiting and the wait was 2 hours so, you know, take what you can get.The food is solid, but not really craveable. The cornbread is good, esp. with the butter, and it's super folksy in a cast iron skillet but it's a pretty small portion and again, not necessarily craveable.Service is mostly attentive and friendly.There's nothing wrong with Crosby's Kitchen, it's tasty and such, but not really worth waiting that long for."
"Food is wonderful.  Cocktails good.  Staff and management are superb and attentive.  Location is easy to get to - walking, driving, or Brown Line Southport stop.  We eat there often.  Chicken and cornbread...definitely do those!Only complaint, and it's not the fault so much of the management, is the noise level as a result of all the small children that are brought in and left to make as much noise as they want while their parents cocktail and chat amongst themselves.  I know this will garner some flack from parents of small children that frequent the place, and BEING A PARENT OF 3 CHILDREN MYSELF I understand the need to get out of the house, but I struggle with allowing your children to annoy and distract other diners that have come to enjoy a nice meal. I worked all day and I'd like to relax too.My advice to diners that want a good meal but don't want to feel as though they are at a day care center - GO AFTER 7:30pm."
"Crosby's Kitchen is a great addition to the strip of restaurants and bars on Southport.  It's a bit more upscale than some of the restaurants, but still casual and comfy.  I've been to Crosby's once for brunch and twice for dinner and everything I've eaten has been delicious.  In full disclosure, I had the same sandwich on two visits, but it was so delicious, I couldn't resist!  The staff is friendly, there is a nice selection of different menu options and all in all, it's a pretty good value.Definitely worth a visit and the patio is also a great spot to sit and relax when the weather is nice."
Very stroller/kid friendly atmosphere.  Don't drink the water - you might get pregnant.  Kids eat free mon-fri from 4-6p.   absolutely amazing food...  spectacular service.    Everything was delish.  lobster deviled eggs and the cornbread were probably by two favorites!!
"I'm basically going to say the same thing everyone has already said. Cornbread. YES. Lobster Deviled Eggs. YES. Crab Cakes. YES. We also enjoyed a Shepard's Pie special and veggie burger, which were both quite good. The mashed potatoes are amazingly creamy and delicious. We probably each consumed about 5,000 calories. Definitely not a place to eat light.They have a drink menu with beer and cocktails. I'd stick with the beer. The cocktails were okay, but made a little too sweet/mainstream/watered down for my tastes."
"Do yourself a favor and get the bloody mary! Easily one of my favorite in Chicago. The garnish is delish and the cucumber vodka makes a huge difference. And of course, the beer back is a nice touch, as well. :)I've been here a few times and I've always loved the food. I don't think you can really go wrong with anything on the menu. The service is great and I like the overall look and feel of the place. One tip - if it's crowded, opt to eat at the bar! The service is just as good and you'll get in and out quick if you are short on time. It's perfect if you are taking a break from work or whatever.I can't wait until it's nice out so that I can eat outside again!"
"My girlfriend and I trekked through the snowy Chicago streets to try Crosby's Kitchen for a New Year's day brunch, and it was definitely worth it.  The restaurant was crowded when we arrived, but we got lucky and snagged a couple of seats at the bar within a few minutes of arriving. I had the Eggs Your Way and my GF got the Fried Egg Sandwich, and both were delicious.  The potatoes were the ""best hashbrowns she's ever had at a brunch place in Chicago."" (She's been known to exaggerate but I tried the hasbrowns too, and they were damn good, so I concur.)  The bloody Mary was also excellent and came with a beer back, which is a mini bottle of MGD.  Our bartender was very attentive to us, and someone who seemed to be either the manager or owner came up to us during our meal and asked if we needed anything else.  The ambiance was cool too, sort of a bar meets brunch atmosphere.  I highly recommend Crosby's and I will eat here again!"
"It is a nice place with good service. That's as good as it gets. I came here for brunch and it was a disappointing meal that I would not even eat it if I wasn't starving. That being said, the meal was so bad that I didn't even like it when I was starving. I ordered Eggs Florentine; it was more like an open-face egg sandwich on top of a bed of spinach sprinkled with salt. It was very bland and the spinach wasn't dressed with anything or prepared in any way- it was like you just opened a bag of spinach and dumped it on the plate sort of deal. The hollandaise sauce was weak- the consistency was wrong and it tasted like butter. The meal came with some kind of 'creamy' hash potatoes. The texture was in-between hash brown and mash potatoes.  It tasted like badly made baby food with random seasonings (oregano, thyme, etc.) that overpowered the natural flavors of the potatoes. It was probably one of the worst meals I've had. Truly a waste of such a beautifully decorated space at an awesome location right by Southport Brown Line."
"Crosby's is a fun, super kid-friendly restaurant with great food.I recently came here and had the signature salad.  They use fresh roasted chicken meat - delicious!I would definitely come back to try some of their other items.  It's also fun that there are little babies at almost every table."
"This place deserves 4.5 stars - it is fantastic! Went here last night for the second time, but the first for dinner, and I am so glad we did. All the reviews about the noisy kids before 6:30 is true, but it's easy enough to ignore. This is definitely a hipster-foodie destination, and is well worth every penny. The food is accessible (no rocket or sunchoke here) and is done with a very creative flair - I discovered unexpected flavors in everything, and it worked. Get the salmon, get the chicken, but (it's true) you must get the cornbread. It is unlike anything else.Nice wine list, creative food at honest prices... a great place."
"We shared two orders of the lobster deviled eggs, and definitely enjoyed our burgers and salads very much! Decent sized portions, quality ingredients. Highly recommended!"
"This place was ok to me. Got there to have dinner with friends. We came for dinner at about 6 on a Saturday thinking we'd avoid the crowd. Wrong! Apparently kids ate free before 6 so we got caught up in a stroller traffic jam. It's a super small place  I for sure think it's a reverse tardis (you know bigger on the outside. Ok I know nerdy reference. I'll continue). So anyway it was packed and we had to elbow our way to the front to get to adult land and grab a drink. After a 45 minute wait and after all the kids left we were able to sit and eat. I look at the menu and it honestly looked limited. Nothing really struck my fancy. I ordered the crab cakes because I know I like crab. Great decision! The crab tasted fresh. There was very little filler and the sauce on the side complimented the flavor so well. I was really impressed. They're served with a slaw on the side. The slaw was pretty delicious. It had a vinaigrette base, no mayo. Amazing. My friends had veggies burgers. We all know I don't veggie burger. But they were happy. They had ODB scotch ale. Amazing!  The service was good. Our waiter was attentive and prompt. He even suggested a great wine for my friends that they adored. All in all pretty dope spot as long as you can avoid the stroller stamped."
"It may have just been the weather that resulted in my group getting a seat during lunch hour on a Saturday afternoon, but i'm not complaining. This place is centrally located in lakeview in what seemed to be a very poppin active neighborhood. It is surrounded by parks, lots of pet grooming shops, bars, restaurants, lounges, fitness centers and cute boutiques! Yet amongst the madness, Crosby still caught my attention from the busy tables and crowded entrance.We ordered their sear tuna salad, black bean chili chicken soup, grilled cheese sandwich and their famous cornbread!Cornbread came out within minutes. It came out in the same pan skillet that baked the cornbread and was served with a maple butter spread - YUM!! For $5, i would highly recommend it.The Sear Tuna Salad, though was delicious, was a bit small, with only 6 pieces of tuna, the salad was priced a little above the quantity provided.The grill cheesed sandwich, though was for a toddler was a little disappointing. one of the toast was burnt and the cheese did not cover the whole bread, just the center. It came with your choice of fries or fruit and we opted to go healthy by getting fruit. reasonably sized bowl of fruit for a kids meal.The black bean chili chicken soup was quite delectable, there was lots of shredded chicken and the I did not get tired of eating the whole bowl.I'd definitely come here again!"
"I am a fan, great build out, staff well trained, food consistent, always crowded."
"The food was really good once we finally got service. The wait staff was VERY slow getting to our table to even greet us. The whole restaurant seemed to be in 1st gear. I did try a Crosby's Cuke, which was amazing, but after ordering 3 for the table, they were out of the vodka for the drink and couldn't make us any more. All in all, I would go back for food, but maybe to go next time."
"It took me awhile to visit Crosby's but I finally stopped in for dinner last week and I'm so glad I did-the food is pretty great! I started with their soup of the day day which was some kind of chicken chili with goat cheese on top. It was pretty thick so they serve it with a few tortilla chips so you can dip if you like. So tasty, definitely a big fan.For my main I went with the Brussels Sprout Salad with a side of their cornbread and my fiance ordered the Friday & Saturday night special of the Prime Rib. Again, everything was really, really good. The salad was fresh and tasty, although I do wish I could get a bit more of the bacon taste. The corn bread is great but the maple butter they serve it with is out of this world fantastic. This will be a must-order when we return. So. Good. The Prime Rib was excellent as well-we're always nervous about ordering Prime Rib because we've had a couple bad experiences but Crosby's does a great job-tender and delicious!Very friendly staff, great atmosphere, tons of kids....and I mean tons. They are very kid-friendly here and I think it has become a neighborhood hotspot for that reason."
"I liked it but didn't love it.First of all, the signage is hot helpful. The only way I found it is because I knew the address. Otherwise I'd definitely have missed it. Maybe I wasn't very alert that day.The staff was friendly, our orders were correct and the food was good. It seemed to take a while for it to come out but husband remembers it coming out quickly, so maybe it was just my state of mind.I loved the design in the bathroom, and I enjoyed the open space of the restaurant where you can see into the kitchen.There were many families in there but it wasn't disturbing (yes I find screaming children while I'm trying to eat to be disturbing). I learned there are a LOT of families that come there for brunch on the weekends so it must be good for kids. Overall, I gave it a 4 since the food was good, the staff was friendly, and the atmosphere was comfortable. If you live in the area, I'd suggest coming here."
"Simple food, rich flavor.When I arrived on a Wednesday evening, we were told the wait would be about 35 minutes.  Instead, we chose to eat at the bar.Crosby's was quite loud on the night we visited.  Plenty of people brought their kids to dinner, and they screamed as expected.We tried the cornbread on Yelp's recommendation and it was good.  It's got bits of green pepper in it.  Kinda slimy, too.  Like it was made with creamed corn or something.  I prefer a drier cornbread, but no matter.I ordered the rotisserie chicken.  Really moist and tender.  The skin was packed with flavor.  I also had the mashed potatoes, which were really well prepared.  My girlfriend ordered fries with her entree.  While they're the thin-cut fries I generally dislike, they were packed with flavor.  I loved 'em.Service left something to be desired, but we were at the bar, so I'm inclined to let it slide.I'd go back to Crosby's in a heartbeat.  Hopefully, my next visit will be during a less busy time.***2nd visit: I ordered the ribeye, which was approximately 60% fat.  Poor form, Crosby's."
"Really bad meal tonight. This rating is for the meal itself, the service was good. I had the chicken which I had yet to try at CK. I actually saw them take the chicken out of the rotisserie while we ordered our app at the bar. It was dry, the chicken I get at Mariano's is better. Friend had the ribs which were tough and disappointing. The artichoke app saved our meal, we were tempted to send both entrees back but honestly our faith in the food was low at that point. We even skipped dessert which is a rarity for us."
"Cornbread - amazingTortilla soup - goodChicken sandwich - meh, moist chickenNice atmosphere and staff"
"Great joint on the underutilized path of Southport in the Wrigleyville / Lakeview area. Stopped by for a casual lunch, and enjoyed the cornbread appetizer (chunks of jalapeno and served with a maple butter) and the turkey burger on a recommendation from the server. The turkey burger had an Asian slaw and sauce, which was nicely combined with the brioche bun. As a side option, I picked the bacon potato pancakes which were fantastic. Service was good, not great - but overall I would definitely come back for another meal at Crosby's!"
"Since the menu changed slightly, the food isn't as good and I feel like this place hasn't been as busy. I still love this place but bring back the wild rice side...the lettuce in the salad has changed or something is different where it doesn't taste as good either. The guacamole and chips is amazing though."
"Been here for Brunch and Dinner (Lunch - not yet) and it's all been amazing.For brunch, I recommend getting the fresh cinnamon donuts and the Lakeview Omelette. My bf loved his Bloody Mary (best he's had - he said).For dinner, I've had the NY strip and the Pork Chop in separate occasions and they were equally good. Their cream of mushroom soup is so good. My bf liked their Chicken Dip sandwich.Now I have to try them for lunch sooooon...."
"Had a good experience here, albeit doesn't sound like everyone did according to other reviews. We were seated outside and it was a beautiful day. Our server was friendly and had a perpetual smile - which can be a major plus in a dining experience.  Got the cornbread skillet which I loved and the chicken chili which was also great.  The menu overall is somewhat limited, but what I did have was very good.  I am a fan so far."
"lulu and ponytail OR jeans and heels type of place...i finally decided to review this spot after my last visit - for a girls night out.  as stated in many reviews, this place is stroller heaven (ours is the city jogger parked on the right ;) )  yes, we definitely keep this place in mind for early dinners with our son.  however, i suggested this place for a GNO and had an equally good time.  this time around, we closed out the restaurant, lol.  i can't speak too much about the food because i get the same ole wrightwood salad that i order at all of the crosby's and his sisters restaurants: it's vegetarian, filling and always hits the spot.  they have an excellent wine selection and wonderful staff.  my girlfriends and i had a fun time hamming it up with our duo-servers (one was shadowing).  although the restaurant was bursting at the seams - especially for a wednesday night - the service was spot-on and they made time to chat with us.  it's so rare to find a restaurant where i can feel comfortable asking for extra napkins numerous times to clean up spills and spit up OR enjoy an evening of wine with my girls."
"Try the French toast. It will change your standards on French toast. The oatmeal pancakes are good as well, but won't blow you out of the water. They always have a Benedict special that is different every day. The skillet cookie is amazing. They have your classic brunch cocktails--I liked both the mimosa and Bloody Mary but you may have to let the bloody sit for a little to get cold. All in all great ambience and if you call ahead they usually can get you in within a half hour even when it's busy."
"Brunch review only.A Southport Grocery devotee, I never wanted to brunch at Crosby's Kitchen when I could be there instead. I first ventured into Crosby's Kitchen when the wait at Southport Grocery was too long to handle; the next time I picked Crosby's Kitchen over Southport Grocery hands-down.I think I found my new favorite omelette--mozzarella, provolone, Italian sausage, bacon and caramelized onions with a little Hollandaise on the side. Each time I got an omelette, which included a side and a piece of toast, and a bottomless cup of coffee for $17 or $18 including tip. That's hardly a Chicago price! And with so much food, I've been able to take leftovers home each time.PS: Pick the cheesy hashbrowns over the fruit. You know you want to!"
"Quick update - went back for dinner again and this time I tried the rotisserie chicken. Hot damn, it was amazing. Flavorful and OH SO JUICY.  Hmmm. Two things I didn't note last time - the french fries are amazing.  So crispy and so good.  Also love the deviled eggs. I have a deviled egg fetish, so I am so happy to see them continue to pop up on menus across the city."
Great find!!! Their rotisserie chicken pie tasted even better as leftovers the next day!! Great service too!
"Southport was in need of a reasonably-priced, comfort food restaurant. Don't get me wrong - I'm a huge fan of the variety that the Corridor offers - I just felt that it was missing this important restaurant demographic.From the outside, it looks like CK is a huge restaurant, one that you'd expect would be packed to the brim with tables so close you can barely squeeze by them. In fact, it is quite a large space, but I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of space between tables. I've been known to eavesdrop during dinners, so it's better for all involved if the tables are farther apart. The bar is not right by the front door, which is nice to prevent crowding - but don't get me wrong, it still got crowded. I took other Yelper's advice and scheduled a later reservation, but there were still a few kids when we arrived. Not even 30 minutes later, all the kids had cleared out and the bar filled up with yuppies fresh off the brown line from work. Our server was attentive and I think slightly annoyed that we kept delaying in ordering. Regardless, we ordered the seasonal beers we wanted, had the cornbread appetizer, and put in our entree orders. I'm not a big fan of sweet breads, so the cornbread didn't quite hit the spot for me - I think I would have liked it if they added some jalapenos or something!I went the traditional comfort food route with meatloaf and mashed potatoes for my entree, while the other girls ordered salads and the burger. Everyone was very complimentary of their dishes, and I had food envy of the salads - they looked so vibrant and flavorful! My meatloaf was still satisfying. I also liked that it wasn't the traditional square meatloaf - it actually looked like the combination of different meats that it promised to be. I left CK very full, very satisfied, and with my wallet not too much lighter - it will certainly be on my standby list when I'm in need of a close-by, convenient dinner."
"Long day of sightseeing in Chicago, needed something yummy, and kid friendly!  Crosby's was perfect. Karen was our waitress, sat outside..... Service was great. They have a great kids menu comes with good sides and a beverage. I had crab cakes, and my husband had Salmon. Both entrees came out quickly and hot. Nothing worse than getting a seafood entree that is luke warm... We always stay near Southport and would definitely visit Crosby's again."
"I love this restaurant. The food is fantastic and very consistent. The Seared Tuna Salad, Roast Chicken, and Turkey Burger are amazing. Great ambiance ... Casual but upscale and cozy.  Lots of kids in early evenings but yet fantastic date night. Also has a nice bar for just getting a drink. Molly's Manhattan is awesome... Homemade maraschino cherries!"
Good food. Had a great waitress. Bartender was cool. Hostess sucked....over all good experience.
"We had plans to meet friends here for brunch and were on our way when we discovered they don't open til 10am.  While 10am brunch used to be my norm, that's way too late for brunch with my little one. We got there at our planned time of 9:30am and it turned out they had opened early on that particular Sunday. Perhaps they realized on their own that the brunch scene starts before 10am??Minutes after sitting down this place was packed, mostly with kiddos. I started with an OJ, which was awfully bitter tasting so I sent it back. Fortunately the frieg egg sandwich I ordered for my meal tasted much better. My daughter didn't seem thrilled with her cheesy eggs or hashbrowns (she prefers larger potatoes), but probably not Crosby's fault since she was a Miss Cranky that day.I liked it and would be open for going back, although preferably before 10am if it's for brunch."
"The current four-star rating is an overstatement. It's just OK. I'm sure it will stick around as a family location. I'd pass on this as a place for conversing. I""ve been here twice - once with a group, and once with a friend for breakfast. Service - 4 Stars. Breakfast today was fast, friendly, and courteous. Service for dinner was slower, but that probably had to do with a large group. They still did a pretty good job. Location - 4 Stars. Easy to get in and out by foot, car, or train. Food - 3 Stars. For breakfast, the monkey bread is worth the order. Fabulous! My omelette had 80% of the ingredients clumped into one corner. I'd like to say this was the result of the chef being in a hurry, but my friend had the same situation. Maybe this is the way they do it at Crosby's Kitchen? The selection is also pretty small. I was expecting more. Fruit is fresh and the coffee is decent. Prices are decent. Environment - 3 Stars. The decor is cute and the seating is comfortable. You should approach going to brunch here the same way you would prepare to go Black Friday shopping. Assume you are going to stand in line. You may also want to bring earplugs to quiet the symphony of shrieking toddlers (accompanied by oblivious parents.) It's packed by the front door. You should plan on being run over by a stroller (which happened to me.)"
"Solid neighborhood spot.  Salads are all great, especially the Wrightwood.  Brunch time blood's are great with Smoke Daddy mix (though a bit more vodka would not hurt).  Breakfast sandwich is money, with awesome bacon, fried eggs cooked to perfection, and a delish tomato (even out of season in November).  Monkey bread is money. We start brunch with it every time, its a nice treat to share.  Everything from the rotisserie is moist and solidly prepared.  Very kid friendly.  Overall, a good place for a simple lunch, brunch, or dinner."
"This is a great brunch place!  Delicious lobster deviled eggs! Yummy egg dishes, great ambience -a little bro-y, but I won't hold it against 'm!Definitely perfect for winter-time brunch!"
"I live around the corner from Crosby's and am a fan. The menu is unlike the other bar & grills in the area and you can tell the chef put great deal of thought into each dish. I also really like the vibe and decor.I am compelled to write this review, however, because the last few times we have been in, we have noticed the service and quality slipping. I am hoping that the typical restaurant thing does not happen here- place gets busier and more popular, food and service get compromised.My boyfriend and I sat at the bar a few weeks ago and both had empty drinks for about ten minutes before the bartenders noticed (they were not that busy). Our food came out and we were not asked how things were until we were done eating. The artichoke was over cooked and cold on a separate occasion. There have been a couple times I was missing a fork or napkin and had to flag down a busboy because my server or bartender was not around for so long.I really hope the place continues to innovate and puts time into the details despite always having a steady crowd because it has been slightly disappointing the last few times.Oh, also, avoid this place if you are without children between 4-6pm...kids eat for free in those hours and the inside kind of resembles a Sunday morning at Denny's then."
"Good stuff.I usually split the brussel sprout salad, and get the cornbread for the table.I don't even like cornbread, but it's almost like cake with the maple butter they serve with it. Order an extra butter when you order- you'll want more anyway. It's surprisingly moist, with good crisp, semi-burnt edges, and little al dente jalepeno bites in it.I've had the ribs, filet of beef, shrimp pasta, salmon, and prime rib. All good. But, get the chicken if you haven't yet. It's delightful.Good drinks too- I like the house manhattan, of course.Good spot for a date too.I still wish they'd come up with a special dish called Stills & Hash- some sort of hashbrown side to go with the chicken, maybe some whiskey to be the Stills part? I'm dreaming here, but Crosby's Chicken, Stills, & Hash sounds like it should be on the menu : )"
"A southern feeling kitchen atmosphere with a fun menu. A little sparse, but fun. Space is cavernous and the BBQ smell is amazing. Wanted to try the lobster deviled eggs because deviled eggs are like the devil to me but didn't get an appetizer. Maybe next time.Had the chicken dip sandwich. A-ok is about right. The rotisserie chicken is quite good and so are the mashed potatoes. Topped with fresh arugula and onions made it excellent. Now if they could use garden tomatoes we would have a 5-star sandwich.Prices are typical for Southport and the waitstaff is super friendly.The menu needs a creative kick in the pants but maybe they will consider expanding it as the options are a little safe....."
"I am definitely a fan of Crosby's Kitchen.  My wife and I stopped in for brunch, and we truly enjoyed the experience.  The quoted wait was 25 minutes, but we decided to take advantage of a couple of open seats at the bar.  I ordered the Benedict of the Day, which happened to be a Huevos Rancheros Benedict.  For my side, I subbed for the bacon potato cakes.   Delicious!  The Huevos Rancheros were quite flavorful.  The bacon potato cakes were crispy, cheesy, savory genius!  I would order the exact same dish again.The bartender was very friendly and gave us great service.  The atmosphere was rustic and relaxed.  I would definitely return."
"We were told the wait would be 20-25 minutes but we could wait at the bar in the meantime. Well the bar was packed and the wait ended up being 30-35 minutes. There is a decent sized waiting area so it wasn't uncomfortable but we did watch a lot of people from the athletic club across the street walk in to ask about the wait and walk out so they did lose quite a bit of business. From the outside, this place looks huge but that couldn't be farther from the truth. Along one wall there are about 5-6 booths. On the opposite wall there are again 5-6 booths that sit 4 maybe 5 people comfortably. In the center is a row of 6-7 tables that can sit 4 people and a row of 8-9 tables that can sit 2-4 people. Backing up to those two rows of tables are another 6 booths that can sit 2-4 right next to the kitchen. The bar sits about 20 people but I have no idea if you can order food from there or not and it is first come first serve. They could definitely have added more tables they had planned the layout better. There almost seemed to be too much space between rows of tables/booths. if  The kitchen is pretty much out in the open and is visible to just about every table in the place, which I liked and I thought it lived up to the name of the place. If you call yourself Crosby's Kitchen, I would like to see the kitchen. I had heard that this place had phenomenal corn bread, that's another part of the reason why I chose it. My boyfriend and I love cornbread. Since I'm from the South, I have a very high standard that has to be met and I am often disappointed. Our server was very friendly but neglected to tell us certain things about the menu. They were out of two of the beers I tried to order. In my experience, when they bring the table to the menu, it is the server's responsibility to say something like ""Oh and by the way, we are out of ..."" So, I was a little frustrated and asked for more time to pick something out. They were out of Two Brothers Domaine DuPage French Country Ale and Crispin Honey Cider. My boyfriend ended up getting Boulevard ""Unfiltered Wheat"". When our server came back to the table, she had two Boulevards even though I hadn't ordered yet. It was quite loud so I suppose she didn't hear me. I ended up not ordering a beer but she left the extra, at no cost to us, and I eventually drank that. I cannot let alcohol go to waste!Then we ordered food. As an appetizer, I couldn't resist the lobster deviled eggs. For 3 halves, it was $9 but I figured, why not? When we ordered the cornbread we were told they were out. I had had enough at that point and kind of snapped but she kept her composure. She then explained it would be about 20 minutes, they were making more but it just wouldn't come out right away. Why didn't she say that in the first place? Saying that you are out of something implies that there isn't anymore. If she had said that it would be a few minutes, I wouldn't have said a word. It ended up taking a whopping 6 minutes to make it to our table. I would have expected to wait a few minutes anyways. For main courses, we ordered the chicken dip with mashed potatoes and the Wrightwood salad.  It came out piping hot, as any good cornbread should. The menu simply says ""iron skilled cornbread served hot with maple butter"". I felt that it had a little spiciness to it but I was pleasantly surprised and I would order it again. The lobster deviled eggs came out about two minutes after the cornbread. They were outstanding, smooth, and most importantly loaded with succulent lobster. At $9 they are a little pricey but if you love deviled eggs or lobster these are for you, splurge a little! I can't say enough good things.Our food came out about 10 minutes later.  The chicken was succulent and not dried out at all. The chicken dip included rotisserie chicken, jack cheese, tomato, onion, arugula, and chicken au jus. The jack cheese was the perfect compliment and the bread held up to the au jus. The au jus was almost completely unnecessary. The chicken was perfect all on it's own but the au jus wasn't overly salty which I liked. The mashed potatoes were forgettable, they didn't have any particular taste and were kind of lumpy.I didn't get a great picture of the Wrightwood salad but it had a lot going on. It included rotisserie chicken, tomatoes, craisins, avocado, goat cheese, corn, almonds, citrus vinaigrette, and cornbread croutons. Let me tell you, this salad was delicious. The cornbread croutons were perfect and the goat cheese was fresh and creamy. Sometimes when they throw everything in a salad it is a bit overwhelming. Not in this case, every flavor complimented the next and the textures were also extremely diverse. We skipped dessert to go to an Italian ice place but the skillet cookies is supposed to be phenomenal here, we will be back to try it again. The manager, Michelle, ended up taking the cornbread off our bill since here was an issue which she definitely didn't have to do but we appreciated"
"With Crosby's being new and all, you can expect a wait. I stopped by a couple times before actually eating here, because I'm impatient and didn't want to wait. 9pm on a Sunday is clearly the way to go. There are babies galore around Southport, it's like you can't escape them...but there were no babies to be seen on Sunday night. Nice. The interior is pretty sleek and open - much more my style than most restaurants on Southport. I suppose they're still getting their bearings, because they ran out of a bunch of things for dinner. No leg of lamb, cornbread, fish of the day, coleslaw, NY strip or a couple of beers. So we got the guacamole and babyback ribs to munch on at first. The guacamole was nice and fresh and chunky. Surprisingly, the ribs were really tender and good. I feel like it's pretty easy for ribs to fall in the mediocre category, but these were nice. When we ordered the rotisserie chicken flatbread, my friend asked for a little cup of sliced up jalapenos. You might be like, who even asks for shit like that, but even I have been converted. The flatbread was good on it's own, but the jalapenos gave it a little kick - a recommended customization.We were the last ones in the restaurant and even got to witness the staff's pow wow at the end of the night. Never did we feel rushed to get the fuck out while finishing our drinks, though. (Side note: the beer selection is modest yet legit, but the cocktails seemed overwhelmingly fruity).  So I'll be back, because Crosby's is conveniently close to my apartment and I want some goddamn rotisserie meat. Solid."
"This is Frasca's sister (or brother) - so I knew I would like it.  Of course, even late on Saturday there is a wait - and lots of kids (Frasca has the same problem).  We started off with the cornbread - which was amazing.  The cornbread was served in a skillet with maple butter.  In my opinion the maple was overpowering and butter was cold.  Would have been better if it was a soft whipped butter (with no added flavor).The omelet was great.  I can't remember which one I ordered - but the hashbrowns were ABSOLUTELY unreal.  They were shredded hashbrowns with cheese melted in.  So great.  Will be back for the cornbread and hashbrowns."
"I really wanted to love Crosby's Kitchen. The decor is adorable, very warm and cozy. I totally dig the mason jar lights. The food I got was good, but honestly nothing I couldn't have gotten at a dozen other brunch places on the Northside. I had heard good things from friends who had been here for dinner, so I was excited to try a new place.My complaint about CK was the service. First off, let me preface that I was there before 9:30 on a Saturday: before the brunch rush. When my friend and I got there, the place was only a third full. So, before you assume that the service was lacking because it was busy, it wasn't. We were seated right away, but had to wait AT LEAST ten minutes before a server asked us about starting off with coffee. After the coffees arrived, the waiter didn't hang around to get our order (we had already plenty of time to look at the menu). We had to flag him down in order to put in our brunch order. Later, once we got our food, our coffees were empty and we hand to flag someone down again to get a refill. At this point, CK is starting to fill up, but there are still empty tables, so again, the brunch rush was not to blame. I suppose I would give Crosby's another chance, but considering how many amazing brunch places there are within walking distance of my apartment, I know I can go elsewhere and not feel forgotten about by the wait staff. The service I experienced really turned me off."
"Crosby's is a welcome addition to the Southport Corridor.  Occupying the old Coney Dog's space, the restaurant has been completely updated, and is reminiscent of its sister restaurant, Frasca.  Overall, the restaurant has a great vibe - just the right amount of seating for the space with a tolerable noise level.For starters, my friend and I shared the Tuna Poke and cornbread skillet.  The Tuna was so-so, but I just got back from Hawaii so the bar is pretty high.  The cornbread was delicious.  In the Fall, it'd be perfect with a bowl of chili.  For the main course, I had the orecchiette with pork ragu.  I intentionally left off the spicy description because the sauce was pretty bland.  My friend had the chicken dip sandwich which she said was excellent.  For dessert, we shared the cookie skillet.  It and the cornbread - the two skillets- were the highlights!The drink menu was interesting, and the drinks fairly priced.  I look forward to returning for brunch; if their Bloody's rival Dunlay's (another sister restaurant), I may find myself there everyone Sunday morning."
"Great patio, service and chicken sandwich! Very stroller friendly as well - no surprise on Southport but still appreciated."
"The salads are so good here. The ambiance was very intimate for a nice quiet evening with some friends. Also, the service was prompt and great. Our waiter was attentive to our needs and kept refilling our glasses without us even having to ask."
"Cornbread. Bacon potato cakes.I could theoretically end my review there as these were the two most delicious items that we had...and the best side dishes I've had in a REAL long time. The cornbread comes in a skillet and is moist and flavorful, with hints of jalapeno. This is a must order at Crosby's Kitchen. I had the Wrightwood salad which was enormous and filled with tasty, fresh ingredients such as goat cheese, cranberries, cornbread croutons, avocado, and rotisserie chicken. The rotisserie chicken greatly added to the salad. It was moist, and flavorful, not at all like the chicken you typically receive on top a salad. Boyfriend had the chicken dip sandwich, which he expected to be more like a french dip, but was still very happy with it. His side of bacon potato cakes were awesome. It's just about everything you could want in a side dish.Crosby's Kitchen has an interesting beer list as well, I had a wheat that I really enjoyed. Our server was attentive, helpful, and even fixed our table that was wobbly! I will definitely come back for lunch, especially to eat outside."
"I don't mind the place being a draw for families--I rather like that aspect of the restaurant. I didn't mind my pork shank, which was enormous if under-seasoned and wholly unremarkable. And I surely didn't mind the lobster deviled eggs, which were something special indeed. What I did mind was being charged $12 for approximately five tablespoons of a Rittenhouse Rye Manhattan, which half-filled the medium-sized coupe glass in which it was presented. A full bar serving full-price cocktails in half-full glasses."
"Party of six, there on Sunday 2/15/15. First, we knew it would be crowded so we made a reservation for 12:15. We were not seated until 1:00. Strike one. Then, my daughter said they are famous for their Monkey Bread so we agreed to order some for everybody to try. Server immediately says sorry we are out. Strike two. One person orders a breakfast item to which server says sorry we are out. Strike three. Food comes and its good. Everybody liked what they ordered but by this time, we are all irritated and trying to ignore everything that happened up to this point. The final blow was on our way out, my son said he needed to use the restroom. One minute later.  He comes back and says, ""the cherry on the sundae, bathrooms are closed!""  Strike four.  There was a sign on the door that said, ""We will be closed for the afternoon. Sorry for the inconvenience.""  Guess they were having a bad day. We will not be back."
"The food here was good - consistent classy bar food. The reason for my review is a reservation incident. We made reservations for a Friday night because we were getting a babysitter and didn't want to spend a lot of time waiting. We got a call day of and text confirming our reservation, but then when we showed up, no ressie to be found in the system. We showed our confirmation text, but alas, we had to wait a while for our table. I'll most likely be back because it's close and easy, but I won't make a reservation, because what's the point?"
"We had to wait on a Thursday night, but it was worth it.  We got a seat at the bar and ordered drinks (white wine for me, beer for the husband), and got ourselves an app while we were at it figuring that we had at least a 20 min wait.The only reason I am not giving this five stars is all of the screaming children.  I understand that we are in a family-friendly part of Chicago, and that kids should be allowed in restaurants.  I just want to warn people that if you are going for a romantic dinner, I wouldn't necessarily pick this family favorite.  Or maybe go a little later in the evening."
"I absolutely love Crosby's, and I'm so sad that I'm not living in the neighborhood anymore. I've had dinners and brunches at Crosby's, and they were delicious. Food was fresh and well-seasoned. Everything was cooked accordingly. The only downside about Crosby's is the wait. There is usually always a wait, which is annoying. Definitely a great place for dinner with 2-4 people. I would recommend it to friends and definitely would go again to try something new!"
"Best place to eat on Southport! Southern cooking at it's best.  Everything we've tried on the menu has been excellent, but some highlights include: skillet CORNBREAD, salmon, lobster devilled eggs, skillet monkey break (brunch), and ribs.  They also use the NoWait app for reservations which is super easy and convenient."
"Really impressed. Great atmosphere and a fun menu with a little of everything.We started with the guacamole which was excellent, it has giant chunks of avocado. The chips were homemade and very thin. It was something I will order again.I had the stuffed nutella and mascarpone french toast. It was incredible. I ate every single bite.I stole a bite of my husband's hash browns and they were some of the best I had every tried.They have a good number of tables outside, and some bigger tables inside. They were able to accommodate our group of 5 at 11:30 on a Saturday no problem.Since it is on Southport expect lots of strollers and some screaming babies, otherwise this place is awesome.We paid $25 each - for an appetizer, 2 pitchers of sangria, some other drinks, and entrees. I think it is a good deal!"
"We've been here several times over the past year or so. Tonight was ridiculous!! The hostess quoted us a wait time of 25 minutes. 60 minutes later, we finally got seated. On a Wednesday night nonetheless. The food is actually pretty good, but it's Chicago. There are plenty of other places in the city with equal or superior quality and taste with better customer service. Unfortunately, we won't be back..."
"A great spot on Southport, with a solid team.  Service, Food, atmosphere are all top shelf.  CK's turkey burger is one of the best in the city.  I typically only eat deviled eggs on Thanksgiving but their lobster deviled eggs are extremely good and you can add a 4th DE for a couple bucks.  If you are looking for a spot on Southport and not going to Tango Sur, check out CK's."
"Two moms, two kids 10:30 AM on a Sunday.  We ate outside and enjoyed some nice shade in front.  I thought the kids meal was just OK - one large pancake for $6. This place has been written up for being super kids friendly, I guess I was expecting more.  The kids got a kids menu and few crayons.  My omelette was good and filling but nothing to get super excited about.I liked it and would be open for going back, but with so many options for brunch, it might be awhile."
"This place is a snob fest, we walked in and where told our wait would be 10 minutes. As we waited another group walked in and magically where seated before us, we got up and immediately left. I would not spend a dime in a business with an owner who does not know how to train his staff. There are hundreds of better run restaurants with in a few blocks."
Delicious!! I've been here a couple times - and as a crab cake connoisseur - I'd have to recommend the crab cake entree for dinner! If you make it for brunch - the Bloody Mary (with bacon) is a MUST!! The Monkey Bread is also pretty amazing. Staff is always very accommodating and friendly....5 stars!
"I HIGHLY recommend the guacamole appetizer! It's really similar to Chipotle's guac, so if you like their's, Crosby's is a MUST!  I enjoyed the Wrightwood Salad as well - really refreshing and sweet!  Other than that, I'd say our service was good and the atmosphere is nice, especially with the warm weather coming.  My only ""complaint"" is that the menu is really small.  There's not a ton besides a burger for someone who doesn't want a big entree."
"I am actually sitting here waiting for our table as we speak. The food smells delicious, but the wait staff seem to be running in circles confused. It's a Saturday night and we knew it would be busy. We were told a 50 minute wait and it has been well over an hour. I understand they're slammed, but I can't emphasize strongly enough the importance of under promising and over-delivering.  The restaurant has a lot of booths and larger tables, and at least 3 4-tops who got here after us and did not have reservations or their names on the list have been seated before us. I get that they'll make more money off a 4 top than a 2 top, but at some point they need to bite the bullet. There are four equally important aspects of a good restaurant to me- quality, ambiance, price, and service. Service alone knocks this place down to a 2.Update: We waited an hour and a half and had to leave because we would have missed our epic nick offerman show. They let 5 other groups get seated ahead of us. Horrible service, will never go back"
"Oh boy do I LOVE this place. I've had the cornbread, grilled artichoke, ahi tuna salad, BBQ ribs, and wild rice. It was all well prepared with fresh ingredients. The eclectic mix of ingredients makes for an excitement in your mouth that you will not forget. The ambiance is beautiful and the staff is engaging and friendly."
"Had a very tasty brunch here this morning with friends.  Monkey bread was delicious and mimosa was strong.  Bloody Mary was also tasty.  Service was friendly and attentive.  Would be nice to have a bit more selection on the menu, as some of us struggled a little bit to find just the right item to eat, but that's a pretty minor issue.  Looking forward to going back and trying the skillet cornbread!"
"The cornbread may in fact be the best in Chicago, as they advertise. And the country cooking leaves nothing to be desired. We had the burgers and bacon mashed potato cakes. Everything was delicious and the servers have a fantastic attitude. I highly recommend it, if your in the mood for rib sticking food."
I had the pork shank!  Get this!  It is freakin' awesome!  The spicy green beams are not so spicy.  The lobster deviled eggs are great and the corn bread appetizer rocks!  For desert the chocolate chip cookie skillet is a must!  Great place but kind of expensive...
"Great brunch and friendly staff!My friends and I met at Crosby's for brunch this past weekend and had a wonderful time. It certainly helped that the weather was perfect and we were able to sit outside, but had we been inside, I don't expect my review would be any different.Our server was friendly, helpful, and took good care of us. She was always there right as our drinks were getting low and made sure that we had everything we needed.Monkey bread! A must!! And once you've eaten the bread, make sure to keep the skillet so you can scrape off the caramelized glaze.Most of my group had one of the egg dishes and they all said they were wonderful. The potatoes are a must! I got the chicken dip sandwich and while it was good, I wish there had been a stronger flavor profile. It wasn't bland, but it wasn't as flavorful as I expected from a rotisserie chicken.All in all, a wonderful experience and I would be happy to go back."
"This is the best restaurant on Southport. The wait can be a bit long, but it is worth it. If you go definitely get the corn bread."
"Had dinner here w friends and three kids- toddler age. For early on a saturday, it is all young families w kids. Staff was friendly and got the kid's food right away. The burgers were very tender and the fries were crispy and yummy. started w the buttermilk biscuit w goat cheese and apple jam. IPA beers on tap were great as well. Street parking can be tough to find during prime SAT night hours."
"For a long time Crosby's had been on my list of restaurants to try. My husband and I finally made it there, and we were not disappointed. The restaurant was busy, but we were seated promptly. I ordered the bbq salmon, which was so delicious.  Our server, Aliza, was very personable and took the time to answer all of our questions despite the restaurant being busy.  She even helped us decide on wine. We didn't feel at all rushed.  As per her suggestion, we tried the meatball appetizer, and my husband hasn't stopped talking about it. And you must try the cornbread! My only complaint about our experience is that the restaurant was overrun with kids. I like kids, but a restaurant full of kids isn't my favorite dinner atmosphere. We were there fairly early, as we were planning on catching 7:30 movie. I think next time we'll skip the movie and go to dinner later."
"delicious! super great service, fresh foods and very family friendly as we brought our 6 month old baby."
"Delicious food, and very friendly and helpful staff and management. Went to dinner here with my boyfriend on a rainy Saturday night. We did not have a reservation, and we were told there would be a 25 minute wait. Sure, no problem, we thought, so we waited. Unfortunately though, we ended up waiting closer to 40 minutes to get a table. At first, we were pretty annoyed by the long wait, because we were starving and we had somewhere to be after dinner, and we were worried about being late -- however, this was really no fault of the staff. It was raining outside, and other diners were refusing to get up from their tables, likely trying to wait-out the rain. Also, the manager (I'm guessing) came over to us, and apologized for the wait, and actually gave us two free appetizers to compensate us! We were both really blown away by that nice gesture. I mean, we were a little annoyed, but we weren't THAT mad... we definitely weren't expecting compensation of any kind, so we were both really pleasantly surprised by that.I can tell that the staff really cares about customer service, and keeping their patrons happy, and I have nothing but good things to say about this place. Will definitely eat there again!As far as food goes, I highly recommend the lobster devilled eggs, and the prime rib. Also, the mashed potatoes are amazing, if you like thicker, chunkier mashed potatoes, with skin (which I do)!"
"Loved it. I had the half chicken with mashed potatoes. The chicken was juicy with a great, but light, smoke flavor. The servers, decked out in cheesy holiday sweaters, were all smiles. Our food came out fast and the ambiance was quiet and relaxing. If I lived in Chicago, I would return."
"As someone who lives off the Southport corridor, we sorely needed a place like Crosby's -- more upscale but still casual dining. Consequently, the place is packed every night of the week during dinner hours.The highlight is the rotisserie chicken, because as you probably can guess, the only other places making it are Boston Market and Jewel down the street. Obvious Crosby's is better, but not just better -- kills it. If you love tender, moist chicken, you absolutely must come at least try their chicken dip. The Wrightwood salad is also nothing short of heavenly with chicken, avocado, goat cheese, craisins and cornbread croutons. Their skillet cornbread is very good, maybe not the best I've ever had, but the croutons -- yes please. For dessert, skillet chocolate chip cookie will make you quite happy. In general, it's a small menu, but you're more likely to order the same thing each time you return.Crosby's has a cozy, lodge-like atmosphere though it gets loud when its full. Given its popularity, Crosby's is way too small and there's not a lot of room for waiting if you put your name down. Also, given the nature of the neighborhood, there are way more kids/families who eat there than you'd ever expect. Apparently the Four Star restaurant group has a reputation for being kid-friendly.The staff there is plentiful and friendly. They probably have more people than they need. I only had one negative experience in the winter when a staff person held the side door open to talk to what appeared to be a friend standing outside. Can't have that in a small restaurant in the winter. In the summer time this is a great place to eat outside, though I've never done so. Just walked by a lot.Southport has bars, fancy ethnic restaurants and cafes. Crosby's definitely fills a void and given the quality of the food, it's no surprise their business has taken off."
"I can't say enough about this place! Love the bloody Mary's and the crab cakes are to die for! Every time we have family/friends come visit, we always take them here. I feel so lucky to have such a great little restaurant in my neighborhood! I highly suggest this restaurant to everyone."
Love it.  Rotisserie is great here and a really nice wine list.  I had the pork chop (only on wed/thurs) and a bottle of the owen roe (not marked up very much) and the corn bread is good yes
"Pleasantly surprised, as I expect to be mobbed by crying babies when dining on Southport at lunchtime. Food was excellent-tried the chopped salad and crab cake sandwich.  I'd like to come back for some cocktails and outdoor people watching."
"We went here on a Sunday evening at about 6pm with our 9 month old who was about 2 hours away from melt-down bedtime, but we figured that would be enough time for a place known to be very kid friendly. Atmosphere wise, it was kid friendly, lots of high chairs, space for our stroller, and the wait to get a table was 10 minutes - so far so good. The wait once we sat down however was not ideal. 10 minutes to get our drinks, 15 minutes from order to service of our cornbread (which tasted awesome, I want to drink the maplebutter). Then, another 25 minutes till we got our food which was both rotisserie chicken and the rotisserie chicken sandwich - so you know they didn't start cooking it from the time we ordered. The staff was knowledgeable and friendly and even helped us get some room temperature water to make a bottle. The best thing on the menu - the cookie skillet - worth every penny and SO GOOD. Easy to share with 2 or 3 people. It was an overall good experience, just not running back."
"My husband and I were seated for our Saturday 7:30pm reservation on time, just 10 min past reservation time which I get because it was packed - we were glad, a good sign!  We adore Fransca (a sister restaurant) and had heard awesome things about the chicken and corn bread.  We started with the corn bread and had the entrees of the famed chicken and the Wrightwood salad (also on the menus of Frasca and another sister restaurant, Dunlay's).  The skillet corn bread not remotely hot and nothing special.  The chicken was not any better than the rotisserie chicken I pick up at Jewel.  The salad was just as good as I have had previously at Frasca and Dunlays.We could have let some of this pass if it weren't for the terrible service.  Our waitress kept talking to her friends who were other patrons standing around the bar area chit chatting.  On two occasions I had to get up and wave to her to get her attention to do her job.  We had no opportunity to get our food corrected (temperature if anything!) and we were ready to leave by the time she finally brought our beers.Really disappointed on paying $65 for a mediocre meal (app, 2 entrees, beers). Get your act together Crosbys! I'll be spending my money at Frasca. They have similar prices, better food and exceptional service."
"YUM! And reasonably priced. We had the maple corn bread as an app - delish!! I had the chicken sandwich - so good and the chicken is rotisserie. Sister had the salad with goat cheese - she loved it, and my dad had the brussels sprout salad - they both ate everything!I will be back."
"I love this place. Great neighborhood atmosphere. It's always warm, and the service is fantastic. I've had Mike as a server a few times, and he's outstanding. Whenever I come in I request his section, and ask him to order for me and my husband because his suggestions are always on point. He's amazing with wine pairings as well. Go here, and request Mike!!!!"
Turkey Burger is killer! Don't miss it.
Had the spinach dip and brussels sprout salad. Both were delicious. Spinach dip was a little on the runny side but flavor was on point. My salad was delicious. I added chicken which I really recommend. I liked the thickness of the sprouts in the salad versus your usual wilted and floppy piece of iceberg. Can't wait to go back!
"My friend ordered before I got in, the waitress was friendly yet not fake-a-licious. I just had the appetizer the mushrooms with mashed potatoes... it was a big helping and it tasted way better than I expected. But I have no idea how much it costed cause I didn't pay for it.... so I don't know the budget on this... it was a good experience overall."
"Great new place in the Southport Corridor. We had lobster deviled eggs, cornbread, ribs, fish and a salad. Not to mention the cookie in a pan. They were all good.Only complaint is that we had to wait long periods for both the cornbread and cookie as they had run out. How can you run out of cornbread at a bbq-themed restaurant?!?! I will be back. The brunch sounds great too."
"I went here on a Friday night with my boyfriend. We were seated pretty quickly. The menu was pretty limited. I ordered meatloaf with smashed potatoes and he got the NY Strip Steak. They were both really good. My meatloaf had balsamic on it, which was awesome and I will definitely be doing that next time I make it at home. I saw in the Redeye the next week that their chicken sandwich was one of the top 50 sandwiches in Chicago. We could see the rotisserie in the kitchen, but they only offer certain dishes on certain nights of the week, which was kind of annoying. They had duck listed on the menu, but it was not available on Fridays. My biggest peeve was that it was full of little kids. Don't get me wrong, I love kids, but not at a restaurant. I should have expected nothing less of Southport Corridor though. Maybe will try it for lunch or brunch next time instead."
"I think my rating would be different if I had a server who knew the menu, or could explain it a bit better.  I asked for a red wine with a lot of cherry notes and he stated they didn't have any, then asked if I meant that I wanted a wine cooler.  Well, at least I know they still make those, in case I have an 80's party.  Giddy at the thought, I almost asked for a Zima.  But I digress so I just choose a wine from the menu and he left without taking my date's drink order.  Then he told me the veggie of the day was sauteed spinach.  What I saw next to my salmon when it arrived, were asparagas.  He also told me the crab cakes I was interested in were made of all crab and butter so they would be fattening.  I'm not sure, maybe he was new.  There are enough places on Southport to try so I may not come back here again unless my friends choose to."
"Went here for breakfast and it was very good. There's so much good breakfast food on this stretch of Southport, and Crosby's is worthy to be among them.The homemade donuts were amazing. I had deep-fried French toast that delivered exactly on what I wanted.... from the first bite was in the zone stuffing my face."
"A definite do again place for me.  Visited on Sunday at 11:30am and it was crowded.   We sat at the bar for breakfast.  Great:  the inlet with bacon cheese and sausage was mmmm, and I am not a huge inlet person. Wow:   The cheesy potatoes....do try!Meh:  the Bloody Mary was way less than blah."
"Nutella stuffed french toast = BEST STUFF ON EARTHGreat place to go for brunch with family or friends.  It is usually busy, but you rarely have to wait for a long time."
"Is Crosby's my new Frasca?  Dammit, it's true.  And, yes, I know it's the same owners.I went  here 3 times in 2 weeks. That is pretty much unheard of in Chicago since there are so many places to go.1st trip = DinnerWhat I ate:  Everything...kidding but not really. Check it.Lobster Deviled Eggs: 2 thumbs upSpinach Dip: 2 thumbs upCrab Cakes: 2 thumbs WAY upTuna poke: awesomeGuacamole: LegitBrussel Sprout Salad:  yes, brussel sprouts taste amazing when done this wayMargaritas: several and delicious2nd and 3rd Trip = BrunchCrosby's Omelette:  too many mushrooms for my liking. Furthermore, I may have reached a point where I need to realize I don't really like omelettes...too many ingredients.Fried egg sandwich: classic and good flavorsPasta with Pork Ragu: Soooo good.  Now that I'm writing this, I think this was a lunch trip but you get the point.  Food here is good. You will not be disappointed.  It's not super fancy but not plain either. Just the right mix of fresh but comfort food type like items.To think about:  The servers wear gingham shirts.  Might want to save yours for another day or everyone will think you work there :)Enjoy!"
"This place is a kid extravaganza!!! A few other reviewers casually noted that there were a lot of kids at this place, but holy cow! I just thought it needed to be clearly mentioned here. Crosby's Kitchen markets themselves as a family restaurant, and they are very happy to take care of people with small children. They have a ""stroller valet"" and a never-ending supply of high chairs. However, If you're not toting six kids in three double-wide strollers, this might not be your place. We went during what we assumed would be an ""off"" time for the families and it was still practically a daycare.The food was decent, straight-forward American fare. Chicken, ribs, etc. I didn't have any real complaints about the food, but nothing was especially great either. Everyone orders the lobster deviled eggs, and they were probably the best thing I had.Definitely a good restaurant for families, and a welcome addition to the neighborhood, but for now it's just not our kind of place. If the food was spectacular we would still go back, but it was simply A-OK. Three stars."
"I give it 3 stars because there's nothing wrong with it. 2.5 would be appropriate.  The food is fine, though a bit ""basic.""  If you've been to Dunlays then you've been to Crosby's.  There's nothing very imaginative going on here and I assume that's the way they like it because that's pretty much how their other places are.  Service if friendly.  It's just the food doesn't grab me.  It's the kind of place I look at the menu about 5 times not because I can't narrow down what I want, but because nothing jumps out and makes me say, ""ooh, yeah.""  But again, that's how I feel about their other places too, so maybe it's just me."
"I had been meaning to check out this place for quite a while...and I finally ventured in a couple weeks ago.  The food was AMAZING. I had the ahi tuna salad. It was absolute perfection.  Our server was Cybele.  She was friendly, helpful, punctual, and even recommended things (her fav was the cornbread..and she was right!).I would have made this a 5-star review, but one is lacking simply because when we arrived we were quoted an hour and fifteen minutes to an hour and a half wait....we decided to relax at the bar and have a drink first...the second we ordered two drinks the hostess came and said ""your table is ready"".....what?! excuse me?!  So an hour and fifteen minutes actually meant 5 minutes?  Ok! It's good for me...but bad for all the people they probably turned away that afternoon, who didn't want to wait that long.Overall though....awesome replacement of that silly hot dog joint :-)"
"Mmmmmm cornbread. I'm usually not a cornbread fan, but put it in a skillet and serve with sweet butter, and it's my favorite thing there. So make sure you order it. I've been to Dunlays and Frasca, so the atmosphere was sort of the same, but a little more homey. They even have the Wrightwood salad, which I love, so it's nice to have an option that I know will be good. I ended up getting the Chicken Dip sandwich since the whole idea of this place is the rotisserie chicken. It was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. The mashed potatoes were really good though! Nice and chunky. I always want the skillet cookie, but never have room!!!!! So next time I'll order that first and eat my meal backwards."
"My family had dinner here on Labor Day with my in-laws, and we all had a great time.Right off the bat, here is something that deeply impressed me.  I asked our waitress what the ""Fresh Catch of the Day"" was - with low expectations.  After all, Monday is the worst day to order fresh seafood, since typically you're getting what's leftover from the weekend.  Plus, it was a holiday - what was I thinking?  Well, our waitress told me the catch was Walleye, and that in order to get it fresh on a holiday they had to find a different purveyor!  Now *that* is dedication to quality ingredients!We ordered the guacamole as an app (very fresh tasting, though I wanted more heat in the form of fresh jalapenos), while my wife ordered a crab cake.  I had a bite, and let me tell you it was twice as good (and half the price) of the crab cakes I had a few days earlier at Joe's.For entrees, I ordered the Walleye, which came out simply grilled with just a little salt and pepper (when seafood is fresh, often simpler is better), and it was great.  My meal also came with excellent grilled asparagus with a little snap to them still.My wife had a half-slab of ribs, which we both thought were just great.  Our 8 yr old daughter had the chicken tenders, which were NOT the frozen product you find at 90% of the places in town, they were clearly made to order.  (I should mention that I have 15 years in the restaurant biz in a former life, at every front or back-of-house position including GM, so I know a few things...).  Her fries were the skinny kind, hand-cut, and were terrific - again, this is an area where so many other places cut corners.My in-laws both had burgers, which they enjoyed very much.  My father-in-law's was overcooked - the only significant flaw in the entire meal - but since he still enjoyed it, he did not send it back.For dessert, our waitress Amy overheard that I was celebrating my birthday, and she sent over a choc chip cookie in a skillet with vanilla ice cream with a candle (thankfully, the staff did NOT sing to me!), and it was delicious.  I had my heart set on the Key Lime Pie so I ordered that too, and it was also excellent.So the food was top-notch, the service was really on top of things (any request was fulfilled in the blink on an eye it seemed), our waitress was knowledgeable and genuinely friendly, and we didn't spend a ton of money.  Bravo.One last thing... on the way out the door, the hostess wished me a happy birthday.  I had not interacted with her before, but she must have noticed our celebration.  It was an unexpected and sincere gesture that really made me feel special."
"Four stars for the food, two stars for the atmosphere.  Average of three.The rotisserie chicken is excellent, and the brussels sprouts salad is awesome.  Good selections of wine by the glass, albeit a touch expensive for a casual place.The atmosphere, while a beautiful space, leaves much to be desired.  On our recent Wednesday night visit (around 7:45, so it wasn't early or anything), the amount of kids screaming and running around like it was Chuck E Cheese was CRAZY and made for a pretty unpleasant meal.   If Crosby's can find the right balance between the Southport stroller set and the rest of the Lakeview demographic they will be OK.  I think they are trying WAY too hard to cater to the family crowd, and it may come at the expense of alienating other people in the Southport Corridor area who were really happy to get a legitimate restaurant (not a bar that serves food) in the 'hood."
"Oh man, Crosby's is so delicious. It's everything I wanted for a late brunch/lunch on Saturday. It's not a big place, but its a great environment and it smells like a wood burning fireplace. I had the turkey burger which was absolutely delicious. My fiance had an omelette (don't remember which one - lakeview, perhaps?) and his was great as well -- the side of potatoes were PHENOMENAL. The best thing about it - it was slightly less expensive than I thought it would be! I can't wait to come and try some of the meat we saw turning in the oven for dinner one night."
"Boo. Food was sub-standard and overpriced.  I tried to get a table on the patio in the summer for two people.  There was a section of about 12 tables completely empty and no people waiting.  The host told us that they 'weren't at that point yet'.  I'm not sure why you would turn away customers but that was my second and last attempt at eating there.  Mystic Celt right next door is way better, and they actually sat us!"
"I was so excited when a new restaurant was opening up around the corner from me and I can now say, I'm even MORE excited that it's Crosby's Kitchen.The place has been PACKED since opening - seriously - packed...like 45 minute wait packed.  Somehow through all the chaos, I've managed to eat there two times.  FIRST thing in the morning for breakfast and recently dinner at 7:00pm. Both times (right when they open) and 7:00pm were perfect and we were able to sit right away.First, I have to say, I love the decor inside...it's kind of like chic farmhouse - howevever the menu is not ""southern"" food.That being said, they have great options and everything I've tested out was delish.For breakfast, I tried the donuts and I would highly recommend, they came out piping hot and were sooo good w/ coffee in the morning and they're pretty airy as well.  After the donuts, I did order an omelet w/ veggies and goat cheese inside. Overall, it was good - it was pretty dense though so I only had a few bites.Dinner - we tried the cornbread which was VERY good - almost like a dessert and enough for 4 people.  I had the sashimi salad which was very unexpected.  It was pretty large, there was a dressing over the sashimi as well - it was VERY good.  Although, I probably will ask for dressing on the side next time - I'm not a huge dressing fan.My husband had the rotisserie chicken which was amazing!  I loved it.We ended the night with the cookie skillet and I would say out of all the cookie skillets in the city - this one is by far the best...hands down.Overall, I REALLY like Crosby's Kitchen, I love that it feels like an open restaurant and it's kid friendly AND has a bar for people to sit at if they choose.The downside is that it can get REALLY loud in here and it typically takes a while to get a seat.If you go first thing in the morning, you're all good and if you go after kids go to bed (7pmish) you're in the clear as well.I will be back.OH and I heard they take reservations too! BONUS!!!"
"The breakfast potatoes must include crack because they are SO DELICIOUS! Like, 'I dream about them in my sleep' delicious. Wish there were a few more options on the menu, but what they do, they do well. Breakfast sandwich and Bloody Mary are tasty too!"
"All there is to know:  TRY THE CORNBREAD, TRY THE CORNBREAD, TRY THE CORNBREAD.... IT'S LIKE CRACK!!!! I'm serious I love cornbread like a lot and if you only have eaten that jiffy crap you find at the grocery store then try this. You will have a small tear go down your cheek after one bite.Only reason I didn't give 5 stars was my rotisserie chicken was just a tad above room temperature and would of liked it a lot warmer. But nothing to cry about.The staff is very very friendly. Kept seeing empty strollers come out of the kitchen and we were like ""are they cooking babies?"" But i guess they store them in there... ha!EAT THE FRIGGIN' CORNBREAD OMG... THEY NEED TO SELL LOAVES OR SOMETHING."
"Service was fine, the place itself looks great but the menu is a TOTAL snooze fest.For those who have kids, it seems ideal (lots of kiddies about) but the offerings are nothing exciting at all.Burger was just mediocre at best, the chicken dip sandwich was ok.French fry portions were very small.Unless they implement a whole new menu, I won't be returning."
"This is my new favorite Chicago restaurant. We went in a group of 6 people for a Sunday birthday brunch and were seated promptly according to our reservation at a large and roomy table in the middle of the space.  The staff has a very lively and friendly way about them and they made us feel right at home.Others at the table raved about their salads, turkey burger, and chili.  I had an AMAZING ""Eggs Benedict of the Day"" which was the regular eggs benedict, but with carnitas instead of ham, and a sort of chipotle hollandaise.  It was served with the best cheesy potatoes I have ever had in my life.  I can't wait to go back."
"Awesome spot for brunch, can't wait to go back next time I'm in town. Loved the vibe & decor, even when I was hungover. The Bloody Mary is paired with a petite bottle of Bud - classic. My friends & I were drooling over our monkey bread & Nutella french toast mmm. Convenient walk to Wrigley."
"Cornbread. Cornbread. CORNBREAD!!!I really love Crosby's. Southport was in desperate need of a place like this and I was so happy when it opened. There isn't an item on the brunch or dinner menu that I haven't enjoyed. The rotisserie chicken is the best and of course, don't skip the cornbread! My only issue with Crosby's is that it sometimes is too packed with the stroller crowd. There was one time I was there for brunch with a few friends and there were kids running all over the place! I understand it's up to the parents to keep their kids in check but I was really worried for the servers since they were carrying large trays and hot coffee. I think it was a moment that a manager should have stepped in and politely asked the parents to keep the kids at the table. Overall, my experiences there have been great. Friendly service, great food and nice atmosphere. Definitely recommend coming after eight if you want to skip dining with lots of children!"
"A friend and I tried out Crosby's on a hot Thursday night.  I was excited about a new option on Southport and wanted to check it out.  Knowing that it is by the same people who brought us Frasca, I was even more interested.  I'm glad I made a reservation -- when I arrived, there were a number of people waiting to be seated.  We intentionally made our reservation for 7 pm because kids eat free at this establishment between 4 and 6 and we wanted to avoid the kid rush (don't get me wrong, I love kids -- I even have one at home -- but I was looking forward to a more adult evening).  There were still a number of kids there, but I think we missed most of it.I like the decor and the vibe of the restaurant -- enough of a hip feeling without being over the top.  It's a little loud (there are no soft surfaces, so there is nothing to deaden the noise) and I wish that they had some outdoor seating options (maybe in the future -- I know the City of Chicago outdoor seating license process can take forever).My friend and I started with the Tuna Poke and the skillet cornbread.  Definitely get the cornbread.  I could have done without the Tuna, but it was a nice complement to the heaviness of the cornbread.  I had the Chicken Dip sandwich.  I wanted to try the rotisserie chicken, but I didn't feel like having a full meal, so I went with the sandwich.  I don't normally order chicken at restaurants, but this was a solid choice for me.  It came with a good jus and crispy skinny cut fries.  My friend had the orrechiette with pork shoulder -- she wasn't as in to her dinner as I was in to mine.  I think the texture of the pork was a little strange with the pasta.  For dessert, we had the skillet cookie.  Definitely worth the splurge.  It's a dessert to share and it's delicious.Good cocktails as well -- I had the Effen Cucumber which was nice and refreshing on a hot summer day."
"We stopped here last Sunday for lunch and wanted to catch a little bit of the game.  We sat at the bar and immediately ordered drinks to cure our hangover.  I had a glass of sangria and my fiancee ordered a beer, both hit the spot.  The menu doesn't have a large selection for lunch which was a little disappointing so we both opted for the chicken dip which was pretty good. I didn't think it was amazing only for the fact that it was basic ingredients with nothing special about it; my fiancee however really liked it.  All in all decent food, but a little pricey."
"I've been here twice now.  Once for lunch as I just happened to be walking by and a second time for dinner after we couldn't get in to another place.  I have to say I really like this place and recommend it to anyone as a casual but delicious place to eat.It's small sized restaurant that has a sort of rustic feel to it.  Their menu is concise and has a rotisseried meat's section.  I had the lamb on Sunday and it was perfect.  if you are in the neighborhood and haven't been here yet, stop by, you won't be disappointed"
"First time going in. Great service, great atmosphere, and reasonably priced delicious food. I had the Crosby's Omelette and it was great.Second time I went in for dinner. The half rotisserie chicken was a little cold and the skin came right off. The chicken was still good, but I was disappointed. I still like the place and will go back, but I will not be getting the chicken."
"Terrific new place in the Southport Corridor.Stopped in for Sunday brunch last month w/Sister & her boyfriend.This was the first visit for all of us and we had heard many good things.We arrived to a bustling and packed house, so we took seats at the bar.Staff was friendly and gave great suggestions.Had the delicious fried-egg sandwich, tried a few draught brews, and some quality NFL games on the tube made it even better.Great eats, great staff, great atmosphere.Worth the trip, so be sure to check it out!Be back soon."
Seriously....This cookie skillet is phantasmagoric!!!!
"I came here for book club last Sunday. There were 7 of us and we were sitting in the middle of the restaurant. The noise level was fine, I liked the lighting. I hated the TVs but it's very hard to find places without TVs that aren't fine dining. I order the meatloaf with a side of mash. It was good but not spectacular. I had Key Lime Pie for dessert and that was above average. The portions were decent. The person beside me had the chopped salad. There seemed to be a lot of greens - a lot. The waiter seemed knowledgeable about the wines. If someone suggested we go there again I wouldn't be disgusted or over the moon. so many other places to try."
"Well-priced, comfort food menu. good for families too.gets a bit noisy, but a sign of a crowded restaurant is the sign of a good restaurant!try the mushroom love & orecchiette."
"I was surprised at how underwhelmed I was with this restaurant.  I think I would have liked it more if I hadn't read all the reviews saying how great it was.  It wasn't bad, but I wanted to love it, and I didn't.We had the lobster deviled eggs, the crab cakes, the wrightwood salad and the skillet cookie.  The lobster eggs were good, the crab cakes were good, but not great (and expensive), the wrightwood salad, which I ordered because one of the other reviewers said it was like Bandero's macho salad, which I love, was mediocre at best.  It was just different kinds of lettuce, raisins, nuts and tomatoes.  The machego cheese served on top of it was good, but I'd skip this salad because I found it very plain, even though the dressing was good.Customer service was really good because they made my salad with bacon, which I forgot to ask them to remove, and they did it without hesitation, which was great...unfortunately, they brought me ANOTHER salad with bacon.  They apologized profusely and took the deviled eggs off of my order.  Even so, our bill was almost $90 for lunch (with two drinks).Skillet cookie was yummy."
The turkey burger is a flavor explosion in your mouth. I can't get enough of it. DELISH. It isn't too asian-y as it reads on the menu. It has some tang and some spice. I could eat it every meal. I'm obsessed. It's really good cold too (half of a burger the next day). I like Crosby's Kitchen. They have a great wine selection. Beer is decent although they only have one IPA which is ODD. I branched out and tried the pork chop. It is a hearty portion and is delicious. NOM. I'll be back.
