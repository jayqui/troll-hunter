Humboldt Haus Sandwich Bar
"It took me awhile to write this review because I'm still trying to recover from the Meat coma I was put in by the absurdity of the sandwiches my roommate and I order. It was probably about a month ago, after a long night out my roommate and I were looking for a sandwhich shop that we could pick up from. We decided to try out the Humboldt Haus as it was only a couple of blocks away. Walking in you find a nicely laid out and extremely clean area with super friendly staff working away. We both order the exact same thing. Large Beast Double Meat... Needless to say it was absolutely delicious and the perfect cure to the left over alcohol swirling around from the night before. Though I will never order the BEAST with double meat, because it is completely unecessay and ruins their already perfect meat to bread ratio. I've picked up a couple other times since then and each time they didn't disappoint."
"Friendly staff, cute looking joint.$20 for 2 sandwiches (the beast & all veggies), 2 bags of chips, a side of macaroni salad, and a side of potato salad. Not a bad price, as the sandwiches are pretty big (bigger than the large sized sandwich at Potbelly).The beast had too much meat on it for our liking, but the meat lovers out there would go crazy for it! The garlic mayo on the sandwiches was delicious. Bread was fresh and held its own.We weren't a fan of the macaroni or potato salad, but I don't think they were bad. Just a little too sweet and mayonaisy for our taste. The serving size was very tiny!Really great chip selection (""DIRTY"" brand).It's within walking distance of our house, so we will definitely go again."
"If you are looking for a massive old fashioned Italian style sub, this is the spot. You're paying a subway price for fresh French bread, an inch of satisfying deli meats, and a variety of quality veggies and sauces. If you're looking for 10 different craft beers on tap...this is also your spot. The 8 seat bar welcomes any who wants a good beer with a heartfelt conversation and the 6 or so tables lend themselves to a quick weekday night out with friends. It's also right across the street from Humboldt Park so how can you go wrong. Great addition to the neighborhood."
"What could be more chill than beer and sandwiches, and that's Humboldt Haus!  For lunch, I got the West Sider Sandwich (the turkey/pastrami one).  The French bread was crusty on the outside, but soft on the inside like it should be.  Unfortunately, way too much garlic mayo and ""Haus dressing,"" a semi-tart sauce.  The taste of the meat was masked.  Everything was so drenched, and my sandwich was getting soggy in my hand.  This was the equivalent to the big mac's of sandwiches.  When I eat sandwiches, I like fresh bread and ingredients without a lot of condiments so this isn't for me."
"I loved both sandwiches I have had here: The West Sider and the Italian. Huge, delicious, and awesome.  I need to eat here more often. The side salads are tiny in comparison to the giant sandwich, but who cares, I'm only there for the sandwich anyway."
"Vegetarian review here: Was in search of a good 'ol sandwich spot, and saw that vegetarians love this spot. So I was disappointed when I was underwhelmed with my Nothin' But Veggies Sandwich. It was barely ""ayight."" It had lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, and a few other veggies but I don't remember what they were because it was that unmemorable for me. The garlic mayo didn't stand out either. Also, the ""side"" it came with was more like a ""bite"" of potato salad lol. Again, this is a vegetarian's perspective---the bf who eats meat liked his sandwich---I just don't think this is worth going to for a vegetarian."
Best sandwiches in West Town. The Beast and the Italian are both on point.
"Delicious HUGE sandwiches with fresh ingredients, many excellent beer choices, super friendly staff. Nothing fancy decor-wise but significantly less dirtbag feeling than your average packaged goods counter in the middle of the afternoon. For example."
"Great sandy addition to the hood. Ordered the haus online first, and second time I decided to go in to the actual store.SO COOL. I love that it's a sweet little bar that backs up into a liquor and beer shop."
"Pretty solid sandwich with a good beer list.  Place is small and so is the menu, but good grab n go type of place.  They give you a good solid potion of meat on the sandwich a well."
A super cute place with really delicious sandwiches! Great vegetarian options and a lot tastier than some of the chain sandwich shops in the area.
"This isn't the sandwich you can order for a lunch delivery and expect to work effectively the second half of the day. These guys definitely have a mission to feed people. Plenty of bang for the buck and fast Grub Hub delivery as well. Now, I have to admit that I went into this with the expectations of getting a more authentic deli style sandwich, which this isn't, but I was overall happy with my order. The star of my sandwich, The Beast, was definitely the Haus Sauce.  Really tasty. Outside of that, your getting a sandwich that is a notch or 2 above a Jimmy Johns quality. I'm not crazy about the bread. A bit too hard for my taste, but I'm full and I most likely order from them again based on the speed and the amount of sandwich you get for the money. I probably will split one next time because I got nothing done for the second half of the day, I'm not eating dinner, and I' m going to sleep immediately after I'm done typppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp­pppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppppp"
"Normally I like to write frilly reviews packed with semi-redundant adjectives, but all I'm going to say here (other than this preamble which is currently contradicting itself) is that the sandwiches here are up there with the best I've ever had. And also there is beer."
"I ordered sandwiches for a business meeting (10 people).  My lunch was scheduled at noon, and I placed the order at 11am just as they opened for business.  Order included the West Side, BLVD, Italian, Nothing But Veggies and a custom Turkey sandwich.  I wanted to comment on a number of things:1.  These guys did a great job of getting the sandwiches made AND delivered in an hour.  Gentleman taking the order was very nice and accommodating- dont know if my order put them into a rush, but I requested to please have the food ready by noon, and they were able to do it.2. Delivery guys were very polite- didnt just hand over food in silence like other delivery people, they actually said hello!3. Sandwiches were GREAT!  Everyone at the meeting really enjoyed the sandwiches- we had visitors from California and Wisconsin (if that gives perspective on taste buds).4. Sandwiches were a good size, very satisfying.PS- the Haus dressing is really good."
So freaking good. Huge portions and very tasty sandwich options. Thrilled to have this new addition to the neighborhood! The liquor store attached is also convenient.
"So glad we stumbled upon this spot! The great selection of beers on tap (including a 2013 Bourbon County stout aged in a rye whiskey-yum!), friendly atmosphere, and awesome sandwiches make it a unique neighborhood gem. Looking forward to the patio seating when it gets a liiiiiiittle warmer."
"I have ordered their BLVD sandwich about once a week since discovering this place. The bread is perfect, the meat is fresh and plentiful, and the gestalt is great. Good beer selection (which they also deliver). Not a fan of their macaroni or potato salad, which is sweeter than I like, but if that's your jam now you know."
"Very impressed with this new place! Great beer selection and very good deli sandwiches. The bar tender was a likable guy and I will certainly return. I'd go 5 stars if they offered chips AND a side. Hint, hint..."
"I've had sandwiches from here twice this week. Had it for the 1st time Tuesday & went with the veggie, it was great. Tonight I had the westsider, it was really good. Def a contender for my new favorite sandwich spot."
YUM! It was so good I had to have it twice this week :)
Really friendly service. Great beer selection. Had a veggie sandwich and they will customize how you want it - no onions or mayo for me. Good little spot to watch NFL too.
"Fantastic 30-seat neighborhood sandwich and craft beer spot, with a nice liquor store attached.  20 very good beers on tap at reasonable prices, plus a selection of spirits (including the ubiquitous Malort).  Excellent service, especially Dustin, to help you find the right beer for your tastes or make you a fantastic sandwich with no trendy crap on it...  just a solid sub on good bread that reminds you of what a good simple sandwich was 15+ years ago.  The attached liquor store has a very nice selection of wines (the best in the area by far - and quite reasonably priced) and craft beers as well as a full supply of whatever hooch you may need to help tackle a bad day!  This is a perfect place to have a nice sandwich, have a few beers, watch a game and then pick up a few things for home or for drinking in the park across the street.  Such a great addition to the neighborhood with solid genuine people running and operating it."
"OMG everything here is amazing!! Great sandwiches, first. If Jacob is there, have him make your sandwich: you can actually taste the love. Excellent beer selection and Dustin always has a smile and good recommendations. Music is fun. It can get a little hipstery so bring your bike chain."
This place is amazing! I can't believe they have bourbon county!! Great place to grab a responsibly priced craft beer.
"This is a great addition to the neighborhood.  The sandwiches are great and reasonably priced, and the beer selection is pretty good as well.  Perfect place to stop in, grab lunch and head to the park.  I'm really looking forward to having this nearby when the weather turns."
"Awesome sandwiches and really friendly staff.  Oh yeah, and some great beer selections."
"Bomb ass sandwich! Great size to split between two people. The tap selection is solid with about 20 taps, all craft beers mind you... Overall a great place to grab lunch, and the attached liquor store means you can grab a beer for later too"
"Nice little liquor store & bar next door.  Sandwiches look good, 20+ beers on tap, and friendly service.  Will definitely return soon!"
They price gouge on certain alcohol AND require you to buy additional goods to have the privilege to purchase what you came in for.
"Love that this place just opened up a couple of blocks away. They have a great selection of beers on tap, the sandwiches, with fresh sliced meats, have been fantastic so far. and the service was as friendly as it gets. I recommend this place for a quick lunch or a nice chill drink spot with a friend."
The Italian sandwich and the West Sider were both great. Lots of beers on tap. Great addition to the neighborhood!
