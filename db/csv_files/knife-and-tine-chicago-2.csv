Knife & Tine
"After hearing about this place and passing it by many times coming down Fullerton, my girlfriends and I finally decided to stop in for Sunday brunch. We were not disappointed! We came in before heading to Lollapalooza and got a friendly greeting from the host immediately. The interior was beautiful and we sat in the atrium area where the sun was shining perfectly through on such a beautiful day. They had drink specials for the weekend so we got a couple of damn good bloodys. Me and my friend split the K&T Hash and my cousin got the Peppadew salad. Both were amazing. Our server was very kind and attentive.Toward the end of our meal, the owner came up to us and talked to us for awhile. I didn't even realize he was the owner at first... He was so down to earth I thought he was just one of the employees. He noticed our wristbands and asked if we were heading to Lollapalooza. They had a party bus sitting outside shuttling people to and from Grant Park/the restaurant, which was a pleasant surprise for us! 5 stars all around! We'll definitely be coming back again :)"
"I spent $20 for one of the crappiest brunches I've ever had. I ordered the breakfast sandwich, which was a sloppy melted cream cheese mess served on what I'm pretty sure was a Lender's bagel out of the bag from the grocery store. The potatoes on the side were good. My food came out nearly 10 minutes behind everyone else at my table, which is ridiculous considering all they did was take a bagel out of a bag and put an egg on it. There was barely anyone there but the service was very slow."
"Every now and then I come across a 4 and 1/2 star rated restaurant and I think to myself ""What in the world are you yelpers smoking?"" This is not one of those places. Knife & Tine not only lived up to it's acclaim, but they had me kicking myself for not coming earlier. Did Sunday brunch and between the immaculate service, beautiful interior, and the amazing food it's easily one of the best restaurant experiences I've had so far this year. If you're feeling breakfast try the K&T Hash. It's crispy kennebeck potatoes, applewood smoked bacon, brussel sprouts, sunnyside-up eggs, caramelized onions, and sriracha creme that together will is more delicious than should be in a skillet. For any other meal (or even breakfast if you really want) you can't go wrong with their burger. It's nothing too intricate, but the beef is insanely good and it's topped with their Awesome Sauce which is clearly an understatement. Not much else to say. Just get there now otherwise you're the one who's smoking something!"
"Yelp's Burger Binge Week brought me to this fine spot. Knife and Tine, did you know the word ""Tine"" means prongs essentially like that on a fork. Huh! I guess I learn something everyday. Supposedly the naming of the restaurant came from one of the owner's mom or grandma and she just blurted out ""Knife & Tine"". The others just said ""Oh Shit, I kinda like that, lets roll with it"". Tired and exhausted from walking most of the day I was looking forward to devouring this dreamy burger. From the outside you would not expect to get a big juicy burger, as it is one of the few Fine Dining spots in the area but without the pretentious bullshit that you receive from them, but their burger is a winner.The K&T Beef Burger was a double patty with pickles, Cheddar Cheese, sauce, and Carmelized onions. A well-balanced burger that still allowed me to taste the actual meat. It was not the best burger I have had but it was just a small notch below. What really impressed me was they offered fries with their $5 burger special, an offer most others fail to do. The fries were also quite good, crispy with nice flavoring. They do not skimp here as they truly do care about providing a Poitier dining experience. Well done!Looking at the menu I noticed many items that I do not see very often making a future visit inevitable.  Arancini Balls, a Cheese Plate,  Butternut Souflee, Rabbit and Pork Sausage,  and a Bibb Salad. These delectable offerings along with outstanding and knowledgeable personnel will put Knife & Tine into my Lincoln Park rotation go-to-spots."
"I seriously wish burger binge week could be every week. Knife & Tine showed up strong to the elite opening event bringing their delicious burgers and those fine homemade pickles--so strong that I decided to visit them for a second go-around. Since it was my first time here, I was surprised just at how nice the restaurant is. There's large atrium style seating with great natural lighting and stone brick walls. It seems like a great spot to take a date (there were a lot of couples here). My group cut right to the chase and we all ordered the K&T burger. Just like at the elite event, the burgers were fantastic. You get two medium cooked patties, awesome sauce, and white cheddar on a soft yet sturdy bun. I think it's the first time I've been to a ""nicer"" restaurant and been served a double cheeseburger. It was unique, and the proportions of meat, topping, and bun were spot on. Along with the burger came a sizable portion of fries that were fresh and well seasoned.Nothing but good things to say about K&T. Our server was a nice guy, although I couldn't tell if he hated us or not since there was something a little off about his demeanor. I'm always self conscious that a waiter is judging me for using a deal, and rightfully so since people have probably been giving terrible tips all week long. But other than that K&T is a great spot and I hope to be back again!"
"This place felt very high class, clean and modern. I loved the service, very friendly and professional, and their food was outstanding.I went mid afternoon and had their beef burger with fries and it was very good. The meat on the burger was perfectly cooked and tasted great, and their toppings complimented the burger well. It was served on a sweet bun which tasted amazing.I'm definitely looking forward to going back!"
"Started with a couple snacks at the bar, popcorn was phenomenal! The brown butter over the popcorn was perfect. Lime zest over candied nuts, delicious! Zaragoza cocktail had just the right touch of heat from a chile liqueur. The bartender was so helpful in making recommendations for everything. We finished our drinks while sharing the goat cheese panna cotta, topped with toasted pistachio and apricot jam. Delightful way to finish a glass of rose. The restaurant is absolutely beautiful. Last but not least the hospitality speaks for itself. #informative #theysweathesmallthings#knifeNtine #greatcocktails"
"This is a restaurant that is not to be missed . From the moment you enter the hip atmosphere to the service of the experienced staff and owners your visit will be top notch . Their personal attention to each detail is above and beyond .The food is amazing - especially the bibb salad with chicken skin . Amazing bar ,terrific appetizers and fabulous deserts . I love coming here and so will you. Stop in and discover , you will be writing the next 5 star review!!!"
"I came here this last weekend with hubby and the lil munchkin (14 months now). We saw the amazing reviews on yelp and were feeling hip and excited (it was taking us back to our Park Slope brunch days!)Ambiance: really swanky and cool Service: excellentGood for kiddos?not so much, they have high chairs, but no kids menu (it's ok- he eats what we eat- future foodie in training), but we did get a staredown from the person at the table next to us, and little guy wasn't even acting up (that's not affecting my review- just saying to other people who might want to bring their future foodie kids here).Our food for brunch was really... eh. We left disappointed.I got the lamb tacos: their were too many problems. First- they come in one corn shell. EVERYONE knows that you need to have TWO corn tortillas because the first one holding the ingredients get soggy and then fall apart. Secondly- there was no cohesiveness in taste. There was lamb, with a ""brussel sprout slaw"" which was just raw brussel sprouts without seasoning,  and some sour cream on it. Nothing else. nothing really brought it togehter. there was chimichurri on it- but needed a bit more to make it pop. it just didn't go together.pumpkin bread: was great! has this amazing cream cheese frosting which you can get on the side and then have fun dipping. there are yummy seeds in the bread. very good!hubby had the burger- which is just amazing! excellent on all fronts- and this burger deserved 5 stars. the fries are also great!the cocktails: look amazing and inventive. hubby had the bloody mary and LOVED it!so recap:don't get the tacosget the burger and a cocktail!"
"So my birthday night started out a bit of a mess. The place we were initially going to had a 2hr wait because my cousin didn't name drop upon arrival. (Yes we are those people who use connections... Well I am) As we scrambled to find a place she came across Knife & Tine on Yelp and we were able to get right in. When we walked in it wasn't packed but don't let that fool you! The smells in there do not lie! I had my hopes set on the flounder and muscles only to learn they constantly change the menu and yelp was wrong & you should be warned so you don't get sent off like I did. Since I was let down about the flounder I was a bit reluctant when ordering but they delivered above and beyond than this picky eater expected. The table ordered 2 of the salmon, 1 pork chop, 1 burger, and 1 ricotta dumplings. I had the salmon and tried the pork chop which ruined me in a good way. Now when I cook I'm comparing it to Knife & Tine and let me tell you... My cooking does NOT hold up. The alcoholic beverages were also on point. As were the bread, butter (AMAZING) and the dessert they gave (candle and all!). The server who I cannot recall her name (Asian and Irish... we bonded w/her) was great as well. The summary of my rant about this place is that it is great and will leave you craving it later."
"Came in last year when they first opened and the food was amazing..... Came in today.... Staff is great.... Very attentive.... Got the HoneyGinger as my starter drink and my goodness the minute I drank that I was in heaven. For dinner for the Beef Burger... Very good portion size, burger was cooked to perfection and the caramelized onions were a great touch. Also got the Cheddar grits and wow amazing!!!!"
"I came here for dinner with a friend on a cold Sunday evening and really enjoyed our meal.We sat at a table by the windows in a beautiful dining area (I believe the host called it the indoor ""courtyard""). There were tall ceilings, dark wood, dim lighting and grey stones like a castle. Gorgeous space.The dining staff was excellent, our server gave great recommendations and had spunk and a sense of humor.Between two people we ordered:(Complimentary pumpkin bread)1. Duck skin chips2. Cheese plate3. Bone marrow bread pudding4. Chicken & Dumplings5. Duck BologneseFive plates family-style was more than enough to share with plenty of leftovers to take home.The food was flavorful, rich and heavy. In my head, I kept thinking, ""winter food"" like stews and rich, deep flavors. From what friends from the west coast have told me, food in the Midwest is much heavier, and the dinner here fits that description. (At least, because we didn't order any salads and mostly stuck with stuff like cheese, duck, chicken and marrow).My drawback was that the food was a little salty. However the portions that I took home made excellent leftovers- I added the chicken and dumplings to a rice porridge (congee) to balance out the saltiness and it worked out even better.You'll find creative, new American cuisine in a gorgeous setting and it's a great spot to take friends. They have long tables available for larger parties. My favorite dish was the cheese plate and our server recommended that we eat from lightest to heaviest. It was SO so good. And their dishes are creative. You won't find bland flavors here, everything has a bold and unique taste.When you differentiate between eating and dining, at ""Knife & Tine"" you'll definitely be fine dining."
"Great atmosphere, great music selection, and great service. Beef burger was good, but I can't say it wowed me too much. Little pricy for my tastes, but I had a good experience at Knife and Tine."
"In from California for a visit, I was brought here by a friend. Atmosphere was very pleasant. The music flowed well throughout the entire building. We were greeted at the door by several of the staff. The owner who was behind the bar came out to say hello too. We started with Bloody Mary's garnished with a pickle, which were excellent. We were having breakfast. I tried the biscuits and gravy with a side of the pork sausage. This dish was incredible. The biscuit was light and full of flavor. The gravy was smooth with great spice. The side of sausage maybe the best pork sausage I've had. The other entrees at the table were the bananas foster French toast. It looked excellent and the one bite I tasted was so good. The other entree was the K&T Hash. It was a bowl with potatoes, eggs and sprouts. It was also amazing looking. The service was excellent the entire time. I know this review is filled with me gushing about how good it was, but it really was great. Maybe the best meal I had while in town and that's saying a lot. The owner has something to be proud of and I wish K&T the best in to what hopefully will be a long future. I will certainly be back."
"Fullerton Ave has craved a place like this for 10 years. Hip, cool, awesome food, owners really engaged in thier biz and customers, and the neighborhood. Thank you Knife and Tine."
"The food here is unique and delicious! For example, in something as simple as their free bread, they give you urchin mixed butter instead of ordinary plain butter.Service was very fast, and our waiter was very nice.Besides having great food and service, it's all at a very reasonable price. Another plus is the cleanliness and atmosphere of the restaurant."
Tried this place for the first time. Great ambiance. Started out with the St Like Marrini which was very refreshing and flavorful. The mussels were excellent as well flavored with old bay seasoning. The burgers were THE BEST! Seasoned to perfection with a buttered bun. Ask for a side of spicy horseradish mustard. Homemade and delicious! I will definitely be back and he staff and manager were excellent! Highly recommend this place!
"Very nice cocktail bar with highly talent staff. The do old school infused liquors which I absolutely love. I tried a few apps and enjoy the chicken dumplings a great deal. Stop in this spot for a drink, you will surely be glad you did - especially if Monica is behind the bar!"
"I really enjoyed the drink I had on my visit - the Breath of Life. It was a Florence and the Machine-inspired (Lollapalooza weekend) refreshing summer drink. But other than that, I found the experience over-priced. It seemed like we were getting great service and attention when we first arrived, and we were. But then I had to ask 3 separate times to get a second drink. It was not busy - I just didn't merit the attention of my server the same way others at my table did apparently. The burrata appetizer cost $12 and was the tiniest serving of burrata I've ever seen. No bread or anything with it - just the single tiny lump of cheese. It was delicious, but ridiculous. I also got the donut. It cost $4 and was probably the quality of a donut I'd get at Dunkin."
"I'm always looking for new places to try and this  exceed my expectations. The atmosphere is great for a casual dinner and the service was attentive, helpful and polite. The beef burger was fantastic and the ""awesome sauce"" really made the favors come together."
"Had a reservation for a Sunday 6pm dinner. My friend was running a little late but they allowed me to sit at the table as I waited, which I really appreciated. As I was waiting, they brought some bread with a really light spread that I greatly enjoyed. Once my friend got there, they replaced the bread at least 2 or 3 more times. It was that good. I ended up ordering the burger while my friend ordered the rye pasta. The burger itself was delicious and came with a huge side of fries. My friend also enjoyed the rye pasta. For dessert, I got the red velvet brownie while my friend got one of the pies ( I think it was peach and blueberry). Both were amazing. The service here is great and super friendly. Definitely want to come by again and try some of their other dishes and desserts."
"Not quite the full 4 stars, but I'll give. Easily made a reservation for 1pm for a group of 10. However, a little annoying that we had to wait about 15 minutes for our table to be ready, although understanding that you cannot control how long people take. We waited at the bar and the service there was splendid. The guy was super friendly and happily gave us waters, if we weren't ordering an alcoholic drink.Would have loved to dine in the front of the restaurant by the windows, but the ambiance was great overall. While somewhat busy, it wasn't super hectic like a traditional brunch place. There was enough space around us and talking to each other was at ease with a nice background of some light upbeat old jams. Their bathroom was rather spacious, nice and clean, which is always a plus.Our waitress came by immediately to take orders for drinks. After that, she disappeared for awhile. We were peeved, as we were starving and with their menu on the small side, we all knew what we wanted shortly. One of the other ladies let our waitress know that we were ready though, after our request. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive since then, minus the beginning hiccup.I got the pork belly sandwich. The pork belly itself was perfectly cooked and definitely the highlight. The arugula paired nicely with it. The fennel kraut, house mustard and hot sauce aioli seemed to be lackluster and almost non-existent, which was disappointing, even though I tend to prefer my food to be on the bland side vs. overly flavorful. The fries were a little too salty for me. Despite not being able to taste all the components of the sandwich, I still enjoyed it. Most people in the group seemed to enjoy their meals, including the biscuits and gravy. The addition of the micro greens added a nice touch. The cinnamon roll pancake seemed to be the winner, though.Overall would love to come back and try other dishes. While the food wasn't a home-run for me, I really enjoyed the ambiance and service."
"I really wanted to love this place. It is super cute and has a great vibe. However, here were some of the issues:1. Food took f-o-r-e-v-e-r to come out, which I'm not quite sure why. It was pretty empty on a Sunday night, so it doesn't really add up.2. Food was kind of salty. I had the rye pasta, which sounded good in theory, but really just ended up being a bowl of saltHowever, as soon as we mentioned these things to the people that worked there, they were SUPER helpful and accommodating. I like to believe it was just an off night for them, because they were so understanding and really apologetic about it. So, I'd give them another chance at some point. Because, they were good people and good people deserve good things :)"
"Wow wow wow, this place is truly amazing. I came here for lunch and it was a little bit empty, but it still had such a great vibe. The food was to die for and honestly the best I've had in many years. That's how good it was. Come here, you will not regret it."
"Sadly Chefs Nate Park & Thomas Elliott Bowman have departed Knife & Tine along with some additional back-of-the-house staff; it appears as though Knife & Tine has brought in some new personnel and is reconcepting. I wish them luck, but they have lost some immensely talented chefs and they will not easily be replaced. As such I am downgrading my rating to neutral during this transition period."
"My husband and I came here twice and we really loved what we ordered on our last visit! We were especially impressed with the cheese ball (this made me want to swoon with every bite) and the pork chops (cooked perfectly and all the ingredients complemented each other very well). Other highlights: the owner is super nice, service was impeccable, and I dig the look of the space. Great place for a date or group if they want some great and unique New American dishes!"
So pleasantly surprised by this restaurant. We stopped prior to a show at the Apollo. The shishito  peppers with the Gorgonzola & maple dipping sauce were amazing. But the bone-in pork chop was the best I've ever had! Terrific dinner!
"Cool place...there's great atrium style seating, and the interior dining room has a cozy, swanky ambiance. Decent beer and cocktail selectionsWaitstaff was decent. We also told our waitress we were trying to catch a movie, so food came out quite fast, but not note-worthy service.The food was just meh. Date got a simple salad which was just bib lettuce with a few radishes and Parmesan cheese. I got the chicken and dumplings. The chicken is well-cooked, very tender and has a tasty crispy skin. Very good! The dumplings were flavorful and tender. The consistent complaint about saltiness is not an exaggeration!! The broth is unbearably salty!! The dish has a lot of potential, but the salt definitely overshadows the highlights of the dish.Bottom line, the place is just okay. Might be back to try the brunch, but the food is lack-luster for the price."
"Knife and Tine was a journey of surprises, both good and bad. The good: a masterful cheese plate appetizer that was far more than just cheese, a delicious warm blondie-esque brownie, and tender beef cheek that is a must-try for any meat lover (even if you're not usually the adventurous type). The crispy duck skins were a great bar snack, and the sweetbreads were a little underwhelming in flavor complexity but still fried goodness at their heart. Apparently the shrimp and grits were quite good, but I didn't have any. The bad: the rabbit sausage with beluga lentils was a bland disaster. Even trying to convince other people to take bites, I couldn't finish half of it. The arancini were an acceptable bar food but lacked even the flavors listed on the menu (and the sauce, although tasty, was served on only one of four pieces). The panna cotta had a much stronger coconut flavor than expected and was a bit less complex than the brownie. The duck pappardelle also failed to wow, leaving about half in the bowl. Despite the up and down nature of the food, I commend the staff for great service and atmosphere. They treated us well and I wouldn't object to going back, although I would tread carefully and stick with dishes I knew I liked."
"I was actually surprised how good this place was.I was not a fan of iNG at all....but this brunch was delish.I cant totally remember what I had but I know we had the donuts and some other egg dishes.The donuts were SMALL...goood, but not my fav"
"Knife & Tine offers a fairly simple brunch menu.  The mini donuts were tiny biscuit donuts rolled in cinnamon and sugar.  The entrees were nicely presented and good portion sizes.  Hubby tried the Moe Hash - the brussel sprouts were crispy.  It was a little on the salty side.  I had the daily selection of Breakfast Tacos, which happened to be steak with eggs and Gruyere cheese.  There were two tacos per order.  Lots of meat per taco so I had to eat some with a fork before handling the tacos.  Nicely cooked, but nothing extraordinary about the dish.Not a lot of traffic on a Saturday morning, there were only 2 other parties while we were there.  We were greeted warmly and seated immediately in the front enclosed patio.  The patio gets a lot of light and feels open.  We were even escorted out when we were ready to leave.  We'll see if this place lasts longer than Sprout."
"Went here for breakfast.  Great service and layout and the foods presentation was excellent.  My egg sandwich was good, the potatoes were excellent and hers was excellent.  Places have a hard time staying alive on Fullerton but it won't be because of the food"
"Came by for dinner on a Sunday night and were really blown away.  They haven't changed the space much since Sprout, which is a good thing because it's a really cool place with the exposed brick.Drinks were very good, especially the Fall Fashioned - an autumnal take on an old fashioned.Apps were outstanding, in particular the shishito peppers and deviled eggs.Entrees were loved as well, in particular the walleye.We will be back, next time for brunch which is getting rave reviews.297/365"
"One update to this review--the value proposition at Knife and Tine.  Food quality is still incredible and service is generally swift, as I came by today for my second brunch at this establishment...tried the cinnamon roll pancake, bacon, and the moo burger, and friends grabbed the biscuits and gravy plus the granola and the potatoes.  We also had three bloody mary drinks and the Flying Nun.  (I've been here twice--both times in a nearly empty restaurant--and making drinks is very slow, so order them as soon as you get seated.  Getting your drinks in hand will take 15-20 minutes.)Now that I've tasted almost the entire menu, I have to say that you just don't get quite enough food for the money at this spot.  Also--the brunch menu is a bit misleading, and this could use a really easy fix: instead of naming the top section ""Sweet"", the top section of the menu should really say ""Appetizers.""  The french toast is relatively small, but the other three items are crazy small for the price (the pancake, the granola and the donuts).  So, if you are thinking ""oh sweet, pancakes for $11!"", check yourself and then realize ""oh, ok, at Knife and Tine, $11 will get me only ONE pancake.""  That pancake is really, really f*cking good, but after eating it, I basically needed to eat another full breakfast.  At, say, Bongo Room, $13 gets you so many pancakes you are going to leave in pain.But if you know that the pancake is really an appetizer, at least you know what you are getting.  (To the credit of the server--at least now, that I realize it--the french toast and the pancakes are offered as appetizers, as in:  just after sitting down and getting our menus, our server came by and said ""Can I get you guys anything, say, french toast or a pancake?"", almost as if they are beer nuts, cheese fries or a cocktail.)  The donuts are tasty but tiny, and the granola has to be ordered with something else, as one of my smallest friends got the granola today and found a way to fill up with part of the french toast, side potatoes and a bit of her boyfriend's entree.Value is easier in the ""Savory"" portion of the menu, since burgers, po'boys, and traditional brunch items (hash, biscuits and gravy, etc.) are larger portions.  Stick to that if you are trying to leave full or generally have a larger appetite.  To be really sure--you will probably need both one Savory item and at least one side.Bottom line: $62 (meal, tax, tip) got me one slice--half--of the french toast order, one pancake, a side of bacon, a cheeseburger, and two breakfast adult beverages.  That's a little hefty for what you get, since I left a little hungry.  Quality IS job #1, but job #2--value for the money--is tougher to answer at Knife & Tine(Bloodies note:  across two brunches with seven other people, all of whom I brunch with regularly, the reviews of the bloody mary cocktails of all shades has been less than glowing.  While I don't drink bloodies, I think it's worth noting that none of my dining colleagues has left very satisfied.)"
"Truly 5-star experience.  Our family went to Knife & Tine to celebrate a very special occasion, and were left amazed at the service, food, and atmosphere of this restaurant.  Atmosphere:  First off, they placed us in their private room simply because I stated on the phone we were celebrating.  Amazing.  The room was beautiful, private, and quiet.  It also had a small window that overlooked the kitchen that contained a miniature (or perhaps life-size?!?!) SpongeBob Squarepants figurine.  Any place that is classy, but contains a SpongeBob figure instantly gains an extra star from me.  The rest of the restaurant is extremely modern, clean, and spacious.  Service:  Nicole was amazing.  Very knowledgeable, friendly, and personable.  She made sure all of our needs were met, was helpful with suggestions, and even took the time to show us pictures on her phone and share with me her secrets of infusing whiskey.  She clearly loved sharing stories about food and spirits, and made our evening all the better for it.  The entire staff was very attentive and accommodating.  Food:  All the other stuff added to the experience, but the food sealed the deal.  Get the popcorn while you wait for your food to arrive.  It is perfect to compliment your drinks.  We ordered the cheese plate and the mussels to share with the table.  The mussels were amazing.  Yes, many restaurants have steamed mussels, and I usually enjoy them.  Their dry-roasted mussels are unique, tasted extremely fresh, and the broth was simply amazing.  For entrees, most of the table ordered the burger.  They were all raving about it, and the fries were delicious.  We also ordered the lamb sausage pasta and the chicken and dumplings.  Nobody was disappointed.  When you dine with two sides of a family, it is rare that everyone is happy with the experience.  Not only was everyone happy with their meal, we are still talking about it weeks later!  This place is truly a hidden gem, and is perfect for celebrations or a casual night out.  So glad we gave it a try!"
"So I was a bit apprehensive coming here because it seemed like it would be a nice and fancy spot that would poo-poo on the discount eater in me - but I suppose if you have agreed to partner up with Yelp to participate in the Burger Binge Week that you have to entertain all kinds of possibilites. I thought it would be pretentious and slightly uncomfortable but this was not the case at all. Our waitress Katie, was extremely nice. She let us know about all the specials and kept the drinks refilled. We got the Slagel Farm Burger that was part of Yelp, and it was delicious. The bun had this nice toasted buttery taste to it, and wasn't all thick in the middle but evenly well distributed. The grilled onions and sauce was tasty enough that I didn't need to add ketchup to it. The fries were warm, crispy and soft. I was so stuffed I couldn't finish all the fries. The manager stopped by to talk with each table and patron. It was a very nice touch, and we felt well taken care of. The menu prices are very reasonable. They have rooms that allow for private parties. Oh, I would love to host something here with this delicious food!"
Fantastic food & very friendly staff.  Arrived 20 minutes before the kitchen closed for brunch.   I was not hurried to order & never felt rushed.   Relaxing inviting atmosphere.
"Amazing. Amazing. Delicious find in Lincoln Park. Comfortable, beautiful, fantastic New American restaurant that's approachable with a talented staff and seasoned ownership. Love the Shishito Peppers starter. Reminded me of Padrons I had in Spain! The entrees we tried, Chicken & Dumplings, Flounder with Little Neck Clams and butter beans, and dreamy rutabaga risotto, all winners. We can't wait to return!"
"Had a great date night ... my fiancee had a specialty cocktail which she loved and i had a dirty martini, which I always ask ""do you have blue cheese stuffed olives?""; to which the bartender said ""I do AND they were stuffed with love!!"" ... good one!!Everything was really good - apps, entrees and dessert.  Rian - the owner - hung with us for a few and could tell his heart was totally into it.  We'll be going back soon!!"
"5 Star Saturday Brunch!  Met a couple of friends at K&T this past Saturday at 11 am.  We were met at the door buy someone who immediately offered us a table, we decided to sit at the bar.  Bartender was Mike, great guy, very knowledgeable, and trust me, take his recommendations.  Started off with a perfect bloody, right tomato to spice ratio, and the much appreciated beer back.  Per Mikes recommendations, we started with the daily special Cronuts, and good god, one of the best pastry dishes I have ever had, crunchy, flaky, gooey awesomeness.  We tried both of the daily specials, one was chocolate with an Oreo cream and raspberry jelly, and the other one (my favorite) was more plain with I'm going to call it vanilla cream and caramel crunch on it.  JUST ORDERED ONE!From there my friend and I who were eating both ordered the breakfast sandwich.  Again and I promise it is not something I say often, but one of the best ones I have ever had.  You can tell the biscuit was handmade, nice and golden brown with great crunch while not to drying out the inside, add thick cut bacon and cheddar cheese on both top and bottom with house made mayo and a nice and runny egg for the middle and you will start to understand the greatness I am talking about.  For the side there were seasoned sliced finger link potatoes that were great with it. If you are in the area, take the time and stop in, you will not regret it.Final note, I would recommend reservations, as we left at 12:30 it appeared that the house was full.  I will be back again soon!"
My 1st time to eat at this romantic place for a special $5 yelp burgers week & it was an incredibly great deal w a fresh fries w friendly crew w a great eye contact manner & with respect....great food service n perfection of cleaniness.....& awesome burger....definitely gonna come back!!! Thanks for having me as ur consumer!!!
Came here ahead of a concert in Lakeview.All the dishes were flavorful and large portions. Both the deviled eggs (they were spinach artichoke) and shishito peppers were delicious appetizers. Main courses were tasty as well - shrimp and grits and smoked brisket.We had multiple waitstaff including the bartender come over to make sure our meal was great. Really appreciate the attentiveness!
"Yes yes yes! First time this past Friday but certainly not last.I had been when it was Sprout and while that place was good, it wasn't memorable. My husband and I went to K&T Friday night on a whim and it was such a pleasant surprise.We tried the fried shishitos and the sauce they game with was amazing. Like... I wanted to drink it. Some kind of maple gorgonzola cream- sounds gross (at least to me) but it was so different and just delicious. Tomato tower? Fabulous. We had the short rib and the escolar as our mains and everything was top notch. Really nuanced and complex- everything was well thought out and beautifully presented. Even the salad next to the tomato tower- I feel like mixed greens are usually a throw-away next to an appetizer but these were well dressed and very tasty.We split a pie for dessert (chocolate milk pie- yes please!) which was also delicious. Fantastic service all night from our server and the busboys. The only low point was that I was really excited to try the black cod with ramen- and they were out! Just means I have to go back :) What a great addition to the neighborhood. Can't wait to be back!"
"Knife and TIne?  Spoon and Fork?  Well cutlery aside, this new reincarnation of the old Sprout space did a great job in taking care of us the other night.Love the neighborhood as there is always free parking on the side streets . . .a big plus for this car driving gal!We were warmly greeted and took a seat at the bar to enjoy a few drinks before dinner.  The only downside is that the bartender is a little slow so drink preparation takes a long time so we quickly shifted to wine (they have a great list of Michigan wines another plus for this Michigan gal!)We were seated in the high ceilinged front room which is light and airy ,albeit a little loud, as there is nothing to absorb the sound.  Our server was great- alerting us to a couple of specials and quick to tell us all of his favorites.We decided to split a number of the appetizers and all were delicious!  We had deviled eggs, shishito peppers, burrata and a tower of tomato.  All were very well prepared and all were winners!For my entree- I went with the short rib, while most at the table went with the escolar.  For this meat loving girl, I won the ordering challenge but the fish was pretty good as well.  We had no problem assembling the ""perfect bite"" off of any plate!The desserts are also quite good.  We had some type of walnut pie (akin to pecan) and a wonderful brownie served in a space like bowl . . .loved the presentation!A great new addition to this stretch of Fullerton.  Given they are open for brunch on the weekends as well as lunch and dinner daily, you can bet I'll be back!  But don't go on a Monday . . .for the only cutlery you'll find will have to be seen through the door as they are closed!"
"Came here the other day for lunch and got the burger because they were out of the pork belly sandwich.  Tried both the chips and fries, both were great (fries are better).  The service was excellent and the wine here was great as well.  The burger was good but extremely greasy so I couldn't eat the bottom part of the bun.. Top was too thick so I had to cut it in half.  Anyways this place doesn't have BBQ sauce but gave me some sort of salsa thing in place.  Gotta come back but the other sandwich.  So far like it a lot, cute atmosphere as well."
"Great food, great ambiance, great prices. We came in with a party of 4, and so we got to try a bunch of different stuff. We started off with the beet salad and butternut souffle, both were thoughtfully prepared and delicious. Our mains were equally delicious. I had the beef cheek, which was succulent. The bread pudding on that is made with bone marrow, which adds depth and flavor without it feeling greasy.  The other memorable dish was the chicken and dumpling, which I have to admit doesn't look like much at first. But it'll all make sense when you dig into that unbelievably tender chick thigh and rich broth.The ambiance of K&T is also worth noting, with one of my favorite dining areas in their front area. It feels fancy enough to take a date, but also casual enough to stop by with some friends for a round of libations."
"Just found this hidden gem tonight. We had the Surf and Turf, the Deviled Eggs, and the Crispy Duck...QUACK BACK! The food is good and the music selection is right on. I'll be coming back for sure. Check out the private dining room with mermaid wall paper!"
"I don't always give restaurants 5 stars, but when I do, they're fucking good. The food concept feels classic European modern takes. EVERY COURSE IS WORTH TRYING. Drinks are definitely worth trying - especially their light/summer sangria.The music, staff, and overall vibe is lax, making you wanna stay for a few more drinks."
Food: Very Good.Staff: Very Kind.Ambience: Tasteful and Chill.Would go again... and again... and again.
"Really impressed by this establishment. I had brunch there with a friend, and it took awhile, but honestly I was engaged with who I was talking to and didn't even notice. It was a nice brunch.I am truly impressed that the owner just called today because he knew the service took too long, and wanted to apologize (they also put a discount in the bill.) I really appreciate that dedication to service. I would definitely come back."
"This is a hidden gem in a place you will not expect a nice restaurant. They have great selection of beer and single malt whisky. The food is awesome, we ordered chicken dumplings, rabbit and sausage, stripped seabass and lamb pasta. Quick service and we had a room at the back for ourself."
"My wife and I try a new brunch place at least a couple times a month, and I never review them. Knife & Tine was so good, though, that here I am!We stumbled on K&T when looking for reservations for Saturday (points!) brunch on OpenTable (more points!) this morning. We'd heard about K&T on Eater, they had a reservation available, and we knew we'd be able to find parking in the neighborhood. Sold!We went into our meal expecting some opening-month hiccups. However, the only indication that K&T is a new restaurant was the fact that the entire staff--the waitress, the host, and the bartender--were tripping over themselves to please us. And their kindness wasn't overbearing or forced; they seemed genuinely excited to serve us and genuinely interested in pleasing us.Now, the food. What a great, streamlined brunch menu! They had ""sweets"" (biscuit doughnuts (yum!), a cinnamon roll, french toast, etc.; there were ""savory"" brunch options (a basic two-egg breakfast, breakfast tacos, etc.); and, then, there were ""lunch"" options (burger, pork belly po'boy, etc.). We had:a bloody mary (one of my new faves in the city)cinnamon sugar mini biscuit doughnuts with vanilla icing (yum!)cinnamon sugar brioche toast (OMG. this was my favorite thing of the meal)coffee/brown sugar bacon (delicious)cheese grits (perfectly seasoned)Henry's two-egg breakfast (butter poached potatoes!)fish tacos (maybe the best I've ever had)Needless to say, there wasn't anything we didn't like, and it was one of the best brunch meals I've had in Chicago. We will be back to K&T for sure. We want to try the foie deviled eggs and the ramen--both on the dinner menu. (I should also mention that our bill came in right under $50. Not bad for all the food we ordered!)I'd suggest that you go, too, before everyone realizes what a great new spot just landed in Lincoln Park!"
This place continues to be soooo yummy! Went here last week with my father and husband and everything we ordered was great! The deviled eggs and shishito peppers were a solid start and then we split the Horseshoe and the Escolar. Wow- all the plates were licked clean. The Horseshoe was the table favorite for sure. We also split a brownie desert and that was phenomenal!The ambiance is still a bit off here- the crowd was super old when we were there so it certainly doesn't feel hip or trendy in any way.
"I came here with a group of about 10, and we were treated phenomenally well. We were all separate checks and ordering at various times but our service was tremendous. K&T has an excellent atmosphere too. Love the exposed stone, dark wood interior, and detailed light fixtures. Location is also great, as it's not too far from the redline.Food was delicious. We tried the squash souffle, rice balls, and spoon bread. The draft beer was a little bit expensive, so next time I'd opt for cocktails (better value). And yes, there will certainly be a next time."
"My husband and I tried Knife & Tine on their opening weekend, and it was fantastic! We went for my husband's birthday, and actually cancelled long-standing reservations at Blackbird to try Knife & Tine!We were especially impressed with the quality & detail of the food, as well as the excellent service, given that it was their first weekend. We shared a great bottle of wine. I had the Cup-o-Ramen, and it was delicious! It's a deconstructed play on ramen noodle soup. There was a large piece of fresh and flavorful cod, broth served tableside, and pan fried ramen noodles that softened with the warm broth. My husband ordered the Horseshoe short ribs which were also tender and flavorful. We then received a complimentary Birthday dessert, which was a heavenly brownie. It was in fact heavenly!The server, host staff and co-owners were friendly and knowledgable. The decor is beautiful. We will definitely be back soon!! I could see myself becoming addicted to the Cup-o-Ramen anyway, it is definitely a must-try dish!!"
"From start to finish it was wonderful! Good wine, good butter and flat bread, great cheese plate, fabulous comfort food without feeling heavy in summer, delicious sides and not to sweet dessert! Terrific service!...and the kicker.....we forgot our umbrella and one of the servers ran across the street with it!! It doesn't get better than that!"
"We came here close to closing Sunday night and we weren't rushed at all. The four of us shared the mussels, pate, and the peppers which were all good. I wasn't a huge fan of the mussels. I wish they were sitting in more broth but they weren't bad by any means. I ordered the cavatelli pasta which was delicious. The house made pasta had an awesome texture. I tried my wife's brisket which was also wonderful. I highly suggest this restaurant to anyone. Nicole was a great server!"
Enjoyed my lunch here.  I went with a group of 5.  Every person really enjoyed their meal.  I had the hamburger and have to say that it was one of the best that I have ever had.  The server was excellent and knowledgeable.
"On top of the contemporary, rustic, cozy ambiance, the food is uniquely delightful. Each item on the menu has a bold spin on what you'd expect. From, my favorite,  Shishito peppers dunked in a MAPLE gorgonzola fondue to Chicken and RICOTTA dumplings, the options are tastey, comforting and satisfying. These simple items are paired with complementing and enriching ingredients that send your whole pallet on a savor flavor rendezvous.  Super grateful for this gem in Lincoln Park.Great place to relax and enjoy a local craft beer or nice tequila cocktail!Totally worth a trip from the burbs!"
"I showed up with a group of 6 on a Saturday Morning for Brunch. Even though we were in the Brunch prime time, it was near empty. I'm writing this review, because you have to try this place!The food is creative, thoughtful, and downright delicious. The waitstaff were pretty great too. It was my bachelorette weekend and they treated my out of town friends like royalty. The atmosphere of this place is great, and the details in the architecture were planned out. I wish it had been a little busier to get the Chicago brunch experience!This is my second time visiting and there were new food items on the menu and non-listed starters. Even the butter and toppings on your food are delicious. There were a few things in the food that could be better, some of our toast was a little overdone and the biscuits and gravy needed some more gravy (My friends and I are from the South!). I want to try this place for dinner after seeing the other reviews. I will return."
"Wonderful place to have a pre-theater dinner.  They were most accommodating in taking our theater time into consideration in timing our meal.  The menu was outstanding with the shishito peppers and maple pork chop being menu items I would order again and again.  Best of all, we needed a cab and they ordered Uber for us and prepaid it.  Please try this restaurant if you haven't yet."
"Enjoyed a nice quiet birthday dinner on a Tuesday night. There were only a few people in the restaurant at the time, which gave us a chance to chat with the waitress about food and drinks. The menu posted online was not the menu that was presented to us, which wasn't a big deal, but now I cannot remember the name of some of the items we tried.I was pleasantly surprised by their wine, beer, and cocktail selection. My husband and I each started out with beer but switched to wine for dinner. I was really loving on the Fireside pinot noir. After dinner my husband had a glass of New Holland Beer Barrel Bourbon. I am a fan of New Holland's Dragon Milk, so when we heard the bourbon was aged in the Dragon's Milk barrel there was no reason to go through the rest of the list. If you are looking for a smooth after dinner drink, this is a must try! Absolutely amazed, I will come back to enjoy this... again!On to the other good stuff... the food. We spilt two appetizers, the bitter salad which I enjoyed; however, I would have been happier with more beets and radishes. You can never have enough beets. Love em! We also had a seasonal tart (apple, goat cheese, fennel, I think) which was light and flaky, but we could tell it was pre-made and reheated. Really not a big deal, because it was yummy, but the temperature was warm crust, but cool inside. We wanted to order soup as well, but somehow at 7:15 pm on a Tuesday night they ran out. We were 1 of 4 couples in the place, not sure how that happens. For dinner I had the walleye with wild rice and crème fresh. The walleye was breaded in something flaky and amazing. The wild rice was a nice touch. My husband has the Horseshoe (braised short ribs). I am not a huge red meat eater but I am always willing to give something a try. According to my husband the flavors were outstanding and it was cooked perfectly. I would describe the dish as meaty. When trying the meat alone I was overwhelmed with meat, but when combined with the crusted cheese and kale, I was liking it. On to dessert! Again, I am always open to try something new. The waitress recommended this caramel popcorn flavored crème brulee. Yes, please! When the caramel sauce is mixed with the crème brulee and homemade whipped cream it is like a party in your mouth! The whipped cream has a light spice to it that you don't expect, but well thought out. Overall, the experience was great. Very happy with the food, the staff (thanks, Kristy) and the overall look and feel of the restaurant. We plan on coming back as soon as possible. After talking with the waitress there were other items we really wanted to try, but clearly we ate and drank enough for a small village.Sorry for the long post, but I feel it is important to give credit, where credit is due."
Was there for a seminar. I really like the food and service. It was unique and very delicious. Hope to go back in the near future.
"So glad that we found this place!I went there last night with some friends for a catch-up dinner before we all head home for the holidays and it was perfect!The staff was accommodating, didn't rush us while we just talked, had excellent and honest recommendations, and was very friendly. I arrived 25 minutes early for a reservation for 3 and they let me have my table early by myself. I was quickly given water and a waiter checked in to see if I needed anything while I waited for my party. The ambiance is perfect - music and 2 TVs but not loud. We were in the corner, which can be loud given acoustics, but we were able to enjoy our conversation without raising our voices. And the best thing... the food! All of us were so impressed by our food, even the butter that came with the bread (pesto, fennel butter - which was not overpowering despite containing ingredients that tend to overpower). We started with the shisito pepper appetizers and all of us (even the pickiest of eaters) was making yummy sounds. Those alone are enough to bring me back. Then we had the burger, the butternut souffle, and the sausage - we loved all of them. Can't wait to go back!"
"Been here twice. Once for dinner and once for brunch. Both meals were lovely; great food, tip top service and pleasant environment. First tried this place when my wife's parents were visiting from out of town. Had a reservation, got seated immediately and drink orders taken within minutes. In my opinion, that's always the start to a good meal: quick drink orders. Got a few appetizers and eventually ordered entrees. Everything tasted really good, but I will say that I thought the dinner menu was a bit pricy. Ultimately, it didn't bother me too much, but it did seem to stick in the back of my head. Fast forward a few months later to a hungover Sunday morning when my wife and I were on a quest to find good bloody marys. Knife and Tine came up and I thought it would be a little pricy for brunch based on our last experience. I perused the brunch menu and was pleasantly surprised to see that most dishes were in the $8-11 range. Invited some friends to tag along and we made a morning of it. The bloody marys were awesome, had the right kick and garnished with a pickle (I prefer this to an olive for some reason). I got the special breakfast tacos, which happened to be pork belly that day, and they were nothing short of spectacular. We were in there earlier (around 10:15am or so) but when we were on our way out at 11:30ish, it seemed to be getting much busier, so this place must be pretty well known for its brunch. No surprise to me after that experience. I feel like I usually hold the bar higher for brunch, especially when I am in need of drink or 2 to be back at functioning level, and this place definitely passed the test and then some."
"Excellent food, competent and friendly servers, and nice atmosphere. The menu could use some more vegetarian/vegan options, but they were able to substitute another item for meat in the dish I ordered. Very pleased we chose this place!"
"HURRY!  RUN, DON'T WALK!  They are participating in Restaurant Week and you only have a few more days to get one helluva deal.  After your resto week visit, you will be eager to go again.  I've been to Knife & Tine for both brunch and dinner; I was very pleased with both meals.  The Restaurant Week brunch option is ENORMOUS.  We went at 12:30 and I couldn't eat dinner that night - I was still full.  There are a few things that make or break a dining experience, so let's discuss them - the service, the food, and the space.  1. The service.  I don't know that I have ever seen a more pleasant wait staff.  Everyone was so happy and helpful.  They really were.  I don't mean artificial sweetener happy, I mean they really seem like they are happy to be at work and they just want you to be as happy as they are to be at Knife & Tine.  Our waitress made great suggestions.  I don't think my water glass was ever just half full.  2.  The food. Shut your mouth so that I can steal a bite from your plate.  I've not tried anything here that didn't delight me.  The cronut - esp the one with root beer - is ... I don't have words.  They get sweet; they get savory.  You get huge portions and you want to finish them. 3.  The space.  This place is adorable.  You aren't packed in like sardines, but you aren't so spread out that the place feels empty.  The front room is enclosed but has a courtyard feel - it  will be dreamy in the summer and is surprisingly not drafty - even next to the windows - in the winter. You should stop reading now and book your reservation at Knife & Tine."
Our monthly supper club met here and it was pretty tasty! I like the decor/ambiance of the place. I had never been to Sprout so this whole restaurant was new to me and I liked it - interesting lay out for sure. I had the flounder and thought it was excellent. I really enjoyed every piece of this dish. My friend had the butternut squash souffle and that was very rich in flavors. Our waiter was great and everyone had a good time.
"Enough effort was put into the concept that I'd recommend to a foodie friend - you might want to go check it out...but with the caveat that the food is not rock solid and the service was very sketchy.Our server was pretty great when engaged with us - but he seemed spread thin or suffered from ADD.  There was another server (maybe in training) that popped in but she was less competent.  Water, drinks - didn't get refreshed as often as they should - they didn't bring stuff or take it away in smooth, polished manner.  Just needs some work.As does the food - it's good.  But not very good - some dishes probably more than others - I got the shrimp and grits because I love them - and they server said they were spicy.  They were good but not spicy and they needed more tang to cut the grits thickness.The rest of the dishes were good but nothing really inspired.  I'm writing this in hopes of inspiring them to up their game so if I try them once more I can write a much better review."
"My husband and I were born and raised in Chicago, but have since moved to San Francisco. We have been visiting Chicago quite often recently and have been largely underwhelmed by the food scene. I have to admit, we are incredibly lucky and spoiled in San Francisco...the quality of ingredients that we get here is second to none, so it's not fair to compare. That is, until we tried Knife & Tine on Monday! The staff is super friendly and very knowledgable. Wine recommendations were spot on and the server was fun and totally met us at our level. A quality I truly appreciate when eating out. The menu was creative and flavors were all spot on. The interior was super cute...and we had the option to sit up front by the windows or in back where it was a bit more cozy. They are doing it right! Highly recommended!"
"Came here on a week night with my crew of foodies - everything was excellent. Great value, interesting food and fantastic wine. I specifically recommend both fish dishes, Walleye and Escolar, were unique and delicious, as well as their appetizer Surf and Turf. The service was outstanding. The waiter was passionate about food and a new his wine, his recommendations were outstanding... Please try their  Firelands Pinot Noir from Isle St. George, OH (only $11 for a glass or $42 for a bottle $42) very interesting treat, has way more personality than a usual Pinot!"
"I went in for lunch with a couple of friends of mine and had superb food. We had the deviled eggs of the day which were spanich artichoke, a golden beet salad, chicken and dumplings, shrimp and grits, and risotto. We ended our lunch with a red velvet brownie. I think my personal favorite was the chicken and dumplings!"
"While tooling around the interwebs looking for a new dinner spot, I somehow ended up at Knife & Tine's website. I was essentially sold on the site alone: attractive & uncluttered appearance, smaller (delicious looking) menus, and a built-in reservation widget.My gf and I got there early (couples' dinner), so we buddied up with the bartenders and one of the owners for 45 minutes. We comfortably talked at length about food, cocktails, and, really, the industry in general. It was a lovely start to a perfect dining experience. The service was phenomenal. Our waitress was attentive, and our glasses were never allowed to empty. Menu highlights: shishitos and cheese ball appetizers; horseshoe entree; beef burger (off the bar menu); PIE!The ambiance is also very inviting. Exposed, white bricks in the dining room meshes surprisingly well with the slightly darker, more modern bar area. The noise level was moderate. You could easily hear conversation around the table, but the place has a really nice energy to it. I don't ever submit restaurant reviews, but K&T's praises need to be sung."
"Great food, drinks and ambience. I had to deduct 1 star for slow service. 15 minutes is too long to wait for a waiter to show up. I became the ""waiter"" and that's never good when you're hungry and thirsty. I'd go back but 2 strikes and you're out. Please fix this so I can become a regular."
"Heaven on Fullerton just west of Burger King. A great, immediately comfortable place. Especially (at least for me) for lunch - a hard time of the day to find such a super place in the area.Sit by the front windows or grab a chair at the full bar. The best places here, in my opinion,My initial visit: A super Sauvignon blanc (or two or three) recommended by my knowledgeable server. The bitter salad with beets was a treat -- big, bold, fresh and decidedly tasty. Then I had to have the escolar, one of the only dinner menu items available at lunch. Lunch also offers burgers, pork belly and chicken salad.Back to my fish...This firm, white fleshed fish has an incredibly rich flavor, often described as 'succulent', or a fattier version of swordfish. It proves its worth here. The the black rice is a super touch.For dessert...I could not pass up the pie. There were three choices for my meal. I picked the blueberry. It was served as an individual ""pie"" form with a side of whipped cream with flecks of vanilla bean.Great food; accommodating service. I sat in that window for a couple of hours, eating well, drinking well, reading my NYT and watching the passing parade out front -- a surprisingly good number of baby buggies for the neighbor. Just thinking how -- many years ago -- I was playing billiards and swilling Millers at a run-down billiards parlor just a step away when the neighborhood was, well, rough.Welcome Knife & Tine; long may you serve -- and especially weekday lunch. And a super dinner spot, too."
"I reviewed Knife and Tine in January and this is my spring update -  still spectacular!  I celebrated my birthday there recently and had to taste all 3 flavors of pie they offered that night.  Last night we introduced friends to K&T, as we have before.  So much fun, tasty, seasonal food as always, street parking and welcoming ambiance -  no need to shout above the music.  Our favorite restaurant in Chicago, for sure.  Try it.  You won't be sorry!"
"I literally joined yelp to write this review. Knife and Tine is beautiful inside and out. We were only here for lunch and we had the pork burger and the chicken salad sandwich. The only thing maybe better than the mains were the french fries and unique chips that came with them. The service was well informed and quick with a great attitude. Great music, too!"
"Lamb pasta, seabass and summer salad (arugula with strawberries) were delicious. Food was flavorful and not too greasy."
"Well, I was brought in by the wonderful reviews of the place, but unfortunately, my party and I were underwhelmed. My husband made a reservation for four, a double date Saturday evening for 8:15 PM. When we arrived the place was not close to full and was actually pretty quiet. As for the decor, it was a mishmash of different styles, not really flowing together. We sat in the indoor patio area.Food was good, but I think we all agreed that nothing was great. We ordered the deviled eggs, tower of tomato, and burratta (the biggest disappointment :( ) to start. The eggs were actually quite good, and the tomatoes in the tower of tomato were very fresh and tasty, but there was very little of them. The the burratta was a hidden small ball amongst a forest of greens. It was good, but it was so sad that there was barely any of it!For dinner, I had the fish on black rice and beans. It was good, but again, just good. A little overcooked, with flavors that complimented each other pretty well. But for the price, I expected better.The two highlights of the meal were the drinks and the deserts! If anything I would come back for those. Service was a little bit awkward and shy, seemed like all the servers were new to the game. Attentive but just a little too nervous and unsure about everything. Overall, given the location and price I can't see myself returning."
"My wife and I stopped in for dinner tonight on a whim and we're pleasantly surprised. We were just driving down the street and saw. This new place and thought we would give it a try. We are both very happy that we tried knife and tine. We started off with their take on deviled eggs and potstickers. Both were good. Then they brought out the bread and butter. It was the best butter I've ever had. It was so amazing. I had to order a couple orders. The main course was the pork chop. It was a thick cut and delicious. The dessert menu was fantastic. A great selection of pies and of course creme Brule. Overall, everything was reasonably priced and we had a great time. I strongly recommend that you give this new place a try. I will be going back soon."
