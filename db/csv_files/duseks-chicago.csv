Dusek’s
"Love Dusek's! I had the baby duch and it was so delicious! My son had just bacon and I tried a small peace and I wanted to eat it all. Bacon was crunchy and of smoky flavor. Great service, they go the extra mile to make you happy!Definitely recommend it!"
"We dined at Dusek's prior to a recent weekend show at Thalia Hall. Loved the food and the terrific selection of ales on draft, hated the noise and the ""no reservations on weekends"" policy (c'mon--I'm buying tickets for a GA show at the venue, you won't take a reservation and I have to wait a half-hour which means I don't get as good a seat as I had hoped?). Server was trying to be helpful and cordial, but I could not hear her small voice over the din.For starters, a decomposed compressed melon salad was a delight: lovely plating, nice flavors. Ditto my companion's roasted romanesco plate. My sausage sandwich was good (though it's a joke to serve the huge sausage on a bun), and the accompanying fires were very good, though not superb. An ""ice cream sandwich dessert"" was nicely presented, but the ice cream was too hard and the flavors not as prominent as I'd have liked.Overall, nice menu, very good cooking, too much noise. Definitely room for improvement..."
"This place was SO GOOD!! It's probably a 4.5 star to be honest. Venue - super cool space. PLUS lots of cocktail options with Punchbowl downstairs, the piano bar next door, and obviously Thalia Hall if you want to catch a showService - our server was fabulous, attentive and very helpfulFOOD - SO GOOD! Really thoughtful flavors without being too simple or too overwhelming (which can often happen at gastropub-y type places). All of the sauces and accoutrements on the dishes were VERY well done. Here's a rundown of what we tried in our group of 6. We ordered lots of plates to share as a group!SCALLOPS - I love scallops so I eat a lot of them. These were very unique. Very smoky flavor IN the scallop and well cooked.MUSSELS - Server heavily reco'd and she was right, you don't get mussels like this anywhere else. Roasted flavor was awesome. Mussels perfectly cooked. Very deliciousCOMPRESSED MELON - Delicious salad, but it was hard to split 6 ways. I wanted more :)SWEETBREADS - The sauces and accoutrements were good. Again, this was hard to split 6 ways. I wanted more. We only got ONE sweetbreadFOIE - I've never had foie like this! It was exceptionally smooth and buttery and served with more sweet/savory sides vs just savory/pickled/acidic sides. The toast was thicker and also sweet. It was very good and interestingCRAB DIP - We coined this ""flavor town"" at our table. Need I saw more? TONS of crab - delish!HANGER STEAK - Ok, one would think, hanger steak is good but how good can it really be onc eplace to another. This is a shining example. It was slicked thicker which I loved to really get into the texture of this perfectly cooked piece of meat! Again with the sauces, and whatever the picked veg was on the side balanced by the pea puree. Holy balls. I wanted MORE!TUNA - This was tasty, tuna perfectly cooked. Not as standout as the hanger steak but good.CHICKEN - Who orders chicken breast at a restaurant?! Well, we did and it was delicious. Again, really loved the sauces, the breast wasn't dry. YUM.THEN, we get to DESSERT. We tried 3 desserts. We liked them, but I do have to say they were not as stand-out as the apps/entrees which is why this is a 4 vs 5-star. None of these desserts were BAD but they were unique and not as outstanding as the savory dishesChurro - was ok. Churro was soggy before we could eat itIce cream sandwich - my fav dessertCookie Dough - again, good but ok. Ice cream yum, cookie dough was a little strange in texture.Lastly, they had an awesome beef list. Our server was more than happy to let us taste some before committing which was nice. I can't wait to come back here perhaps with a smaller group so I can eat more of everything =D"
"This place is the best kind of pleasant surprise you can stumble upon! Friends and I showed up here for dinner after reading all the positive reviews and we weren't disappointed! Sure, the portions may be on the smaller side and the prices aren't exactly steep but they're reaching, but it was definitely well-worth it for a fun night out with buddies. Honestly, this place probably makes a better date spot (for the second or third date, I'd say).You can sample the long list of beer for the one that's a keeper, there's an oyster happy hour early in the evenings on Mondays for $1 each (I recommend the Virginia one!), and such a variety of eats. A friend got the mussels (I ALSO RECOMMEND) and I ordered the quail over cornbread and it was absolutely divine.You're in for a fun surprise when you head downstairs to the bathroom! You can write messages to friends or strangers, and they'll definitely respond back when you return to wash your hands after grubbing. I have to say the entire decor is impressive. Attentive and helfpul staff as well. Keep it up, Dusek's! There's an option to dine upstairs and wine downstairs as well!"
"The brunch here is easily five stars! They take reservations, but they save half of their tables for walk-ins and two of us got seated right away at 10:30 am on Sunday morning.We started off with the Beignets, which literally melted in your mouth and were served with a tangy berry compote. Definitely a great sweet way to start (but in no way compares to Nightwood's Bacon Butterscotch Donuts.... sorry!)I ordered the Elotes Benedict, which is incredible! The chipotle hollandaise with the pork belly and the poached eggs was so perfectly crafted. The flavors were all there and the portion size was large. It came with these breakfast potatoes that had a sweet/spicy component! They were really unique and unlike any other breakfast hash/potatoes that I've ever had.My boyfriend got the Duck Confit Sandwich, which is newer to their menu. It was also a great brunch option since it had a fried egg on top. This was served with a side of fries, which were too salty for my liking, but he really enjoyed them. I thought the Benedict was better, but you really couldn't go wrong either way! Drinks - there are so many great ""beermosa"" options. The classic and Pomegranate were both good, but I would steer clear of the Honey-Grapefruit Beermosa. Their Board and Beer Bloody was also delicious and I'm not even a fan of Bloody Mary's! I will definitely be coming back and bringing others for another memorable weekend brunch!"
"Title: Pleasantly surprised in Pilsen.The boy brought me here on an impromptu date night. This restaurant seems out of place for being in a neighborhood known for great Mexican food. It's such a different vibe once you walk in. Dusek's features sort of rustic new American food with shared plates and good seafood options. I would have expected a place like this to be situated in Old Town or Lincoln Park. They have a great beer selection with unique flavors as well as other cocktails. Our waiter was knowledgeable and offered suggestions for beer and food. He let us try a sample of beer before deciding too. We tried this beer with curry, coco, and coffee notes. Talk about complex! (we didn't go with that beer :P) In order of preference, we enjoyed the mussels, scallops, and the quail. I felt the plates were all ideally shareable by 2-3 people at max. Overall service and food was great throughout the meal. Looking forward to returning."
"My review is strictly for the brunch. I went to Sunday brunch at Dusek's around noon, it surprisingly wasn't too busy which was nice and we opted in for out door dining. I ordered a cappuccino ( this alone gets 5 stars it was awesome), mimosa ( super bland) and the Dutch baby (really good!! But slightly too sweet for my taste buds) my roommate ordered coffee, pomegranate beermosa (yumm) and the rarebit Benedict ( we did not like it at all)- the ham was super dry and neither one of us preferred the sauce.***** side note I've been here for dinner and I hands down give it 4.5 stars. I will not be back for brunch but I'll for sure come to dinner in a heartbeat"
"Dusek's is so great!I go here for brunch whenever I can, but judging by how good it is, I want to try a lot more.  Thus far, I've gotten:- BBQ shrimp and grits: SO good.  The barbecue flavor is amazing and complex, the shrimp and grits are perfectly cooked.  My only complaint is that the dish is pretty small -- I need more shrimp to be filled!- Rarebit Benedict: Quite yummy.  Flavorful meat, good hollandaise, and a creative approach to the Benedict :).- Soft shell crab sandwich: I've gotten this twice and the first time I was super satisfied -- it was well-cooked, big, the sauce was amazing, and the fries were perfect.  The second time, the crab I got was tiny and over-fried -- I kept biting into pieces that weren't crab at all, just batter.  Won't get this again because apparently it's a coin toss and I don't like paying $15 for a tiny crab.  However, the first one was out of this world delicious.  - Oysters: so fresh, so tasty, so delicious.  The waiters are well-informed so when you ask about the differences between the types of oysters, they explain it well.  I love the sauce/ bread bits they come with.  It's nice to have good, fresh seafood in Chicago!- the beer selection is wonderful.  I've tried the classic beermosa, the michelada, the brunch punch, the Bloody Mary, and a variety of their beers.  They were all so wonderful!  I love the drinks here.  Even if the food was terrible (and it is not terrible at all), I'd come back for the beer selection and drink menu creativity.  All in all, despite a few setbacks, I love love coming here and will continue to do so for amazing brunch and hopefully over meals!!"
"Food was good albeit very overpriced. We ordered 5 small plates as suggested by the waitress and that barely filled us. After spending about $130 for two people, I was just hoping to get a little more bang for my buck. The food was yummy, don't get me wrong, but I just wanted more food.. that's all. Ya know, so we don't have to pass by McDonalds on the way home lol If we do decide to go again, I will try some of the regular sized plates. I also want to try their highly reviewed brunch. Some highlights:Mussels were delicious, plump, and a good size. The best serving size of the nightService was very attentive, friendly, and welcomingThe drink selection at Dusek's is awesome. Beers galore and their punches are some of the best I've had in the city."
Very cool spot south of downtown. Great cocktail(had this Bourbon type grapefruit radler) and 25 beers on tap. Food was also solid. Mussels and stuff pretzel were good. Hanger steak was nice and juicy and came with the cheddar type churros. Also enjoyed the beet and carrot app and fried sweetbreads(though small). People at my table enjoyed the juicy Lucy.
"1 word: MUSSELS.Oh man, those mussels.  During my first visit to Dusek's, my group only ordered 1 order of mussels to share between 7 people. I made DAMN sure the 2nd time I went with a different group of 5 others that we ordered 3.  The consensus among all 12 of us was that the mussels was the best thing at Dusek's.Now onto other dishes:Bay scallops - delicious, fresh, seasoned wellHam sampler - not the best charcuterie board I've had, but it's still pretty good.Blue crab dip - enjoyable, but nothing specialOysters - these came with house-made hot sauce which were great with the oystersHanger steak - tender and delicious.Atmosphere: the downstairs area is dark and personal, while the upstairs is bright (if you go during the day!) and open."
"Dusek's is a hip restaurant with a similar vibe to Longman & Eagle, so it's no surprise that they have the same owners! We trekked over to Pilsen from the suburbs because Dusek's was on our ""to-try"" brunch list based on the lovely recommendations of Yelp reviewers. We didn't have a reservation (in fact, I'm not sure they even take reservations), but we had no problem getting a table as soon as we arrived at 11 AM on the Sunday after 4th of July. (Actually, the wait for a table outdoors was five minutes, so we opted for dining indoors because we were pretty hungry.) The decor is a bit rustic and creative, including carpet in picture frames and chandeliers hanging from the wall. This type of aesthetic juxtaposition lends itself to the aforementioned ""hip"" descriptor. The bathroom, which is shared with Punch House downstairs, continues with the hip theme by having walls that are a blackboard materials with chalk everywhere so people can write whatever they want. Pretty inventive! We shared the lemon buttermilk doughnut with blackberry glaze ($4) off the pastry menu and it was gone in less than a minute. The doughnut was fluffy and the glaze, which clearly had been poured atop the doughnut right before coming out to our table, was the perfect combination between tart and sweet. I ordered the challah french toast ($12) with a side of breakfast potatoes ($5) to offset all the sweetness. The french toast came in three squares, which made it unique compared to other french toasts I've enjoyed. It was soaked in a delicious vanilla bean custard and was adorned with bits of rhubarb. This french toast still didn't quite measure up to the one at Longman & Eagle, but it was pretty darn good. . My only complaints are that service was a bit inattentive. My water glass was empty for a while until a random guy came to top it off. Our waitress barely dropped by to check in on us. It was fine because we didn't need anything else and we were busy enjoying our food, but it would have been nice. Additionally, I have to add that there were very few vegetarian options on the menu. (In fact, I believe the french toast was the ONLY option.) This is very different from other similarly ""hip"" restaurants that offer a wider selection for people who don't eat meat. All that aside, I did have a really enjoyable meal here and I would be eager to return to try the dinner menu in the future."
"My friends and I came to Dusek's at the recommendation of a dear friend and fellow Yelper Eva S. From arrival to departure, our experience was one to remember and come back for. As a party of three, we decided to order three items and share, dim-sum style. We ordered the juicy Lucy burger, mussels, and blue crab dip. Each of these items were made and presented to impress: from the chunks of crab in the dip, the buttery baguette that accompanied the dip, the bacon tapenade and yellow tomatoes on the burger, and the smoked paprika on the mussels. The ambience doesn't reflect Pilsen, but perhaps a new Pilsen. One can tell the owners have a vision for the restaurant and one for the community they reside in. The decor of the restaurant made me feel right at home: as if one is hosting a dinner party or sharing a drink with their childhood best friend. Before we left, my friend made a reservation for brunch. Yes, that's how good it was: planning our return before we even left."
"Dusek's.  Heheh.  Okay enough with my immaturity.  I came here to meet up with some friends for dinner on a Thursday night, it wasn't too busy and we were seated immediately.Our server Diana was awesome.  She explained the menu very thoroughly and provided some suggestions on what was popular.  I decided to splurge a little and go all out on this meal:To start I got e Boulder Beer Co Shake which was the Cause Beer at the time.  Apparently the beer that has the red CB stamp next to it is the cause beer and they donate a dollar to a local charity for each beer they sell.  I was already interested because it was supposed to taste like a chocolate shake, but all the more better that my drinking can benefit someone else too.As far as food they started us with an amuse bouche of smoked salmon.  A tasty little bite.  For appetizers we ordered the Iron Roasted P.E.I. mussels.  When they were brought to the table, Diana stopped by to explain the various ways to eat it to get more or less of the spices from the shells.  These were really good, I don't even really like mussels but I couldn't stop popping them.For the main course my friends went with the Juicy Lucy (a burger - as it's not explicitly stated on the menu) and I got the Moroccan spiced vegetable tagine which has over 23 spices!  It was very flavorful and each bite tasted different, it was somehow spicy, herby, sweet, earthy, and more all at the same time.  And finally dessert, which was the roasted chili churros.  It definitely had a distinctly smoky flavor, however once the bittersweet chocolate sorbet melted and coated the churros it was a little harder to taste the smokiness, but it was still some great melding of flavors.Overall the food was very interesting (and pricey) and you can tell there is a lot of thought and care that went into creating and serving each dish.  Diana also was super knowledgeable and wonderful about taking the time to explain and answer our questions even giving us a little background on the place.Service here was probably some of the very best I've ever received.  We stayed quite a while catching up and enjoying the food and never felt pressured at all.  Food was good and interesting, not your everyday meal.As far as parking, I parked on 18th St, had such an enjoyable time I completely forgot about the meter and my new car was welcomed it's first time in Chicago with a City of Chicago parking ticket.  I was informed by my friend later there is plenty of free parking on the nearby side streets, just be aware of the zoned areas."
"Came here for brunch and absolutely loved the experience. Having been to Longman & Eagle, I had pretty expectations for Dusek's, but at the same time, I didn't really expect to top the L&E experience. The oyster hash, however, proved me wrong--light, rich, and flavorful, everything down to the last detail came together perfectly and seemingly effortlessly. The pork belly was the perfect balance between crispy and tender, the potatoes flavored perfectly with herbs--I could go on and on about the oyster hash. Lovely ambiance, great service, and easily the best brunch I've had in Chicago."
"Honest review: the food is really good ignore all the bad reviews if u come get RISOTTO, mussels, sweatbreads those are my favorite dishes here ny favorite thing was the porkbelly it was so fucking good best thing i ever ate they dont have it though :( anymore :(Beef fat frites- ok they are supper crispy and soft in the inside not like ur typical fast food fries they didnt taste that good there was no seasoning on them so they were bland the menu says its a hurrisa ketchup but it tasted more like chipotle to me something i would not order againLAMB BOLOGNESE-ok the gnocchi were amazing the best i ever had they were supper soft and fluffy as a pillow the problem was everything else there was barely any lamb at all then the sauce was sour its an easy fix though for the restaurant IRON ROASTED PEI MUSSELS- these were the best mussels i ever had. There is alot of them so like the whole table can share. The spices on the actual mussels are great dont be ashamed to actually lick the shells there that good the butter sauce is really good but be careful it gets really messy though it didnt come with breadPUMPKIN RISOTTO- omg best risotto i ever had. The texture is beautiful not overcooked where its supper gummy and chewy that gets stuck to your teeth not raw or al dente something so soft that it melts in your mouth something a person can never forget. The pumkin in it is the perfect texture there delicious not undercooked Cookie dough dessert- DO NOT ORDER IF U DONT LIKE COOKIE DOUGH the dough is delicious the ice cream that comes with it is also good the problem is it comes with dark chocolate i hate dark chocolate that for me ruined itChurro's-  really delicous supper crispy there are only 3 little pieces though does come with dark chocolate still really good thoughfudgesicle- obviously the dark chocolate part i hated but the rest of the dish was amaizing idk what they were it came with cookies and other things that were great i would jus order it again jus to eat the other things on the dishDrink-crossfader really delicious really tart and fresh not enough alcohol thoughAmbiance really beutiful perfect for a date night the bar down stairs is really greatService- there really nice both times this time though she forget things cause she didnt write things down and didnt really know the menu  Parking sucks theres no parking so thats annoying the neighborhood i wouldnt recommend hanging outside just eat and leaverestaurant if your reading try not to put so many ingredients into everything like some dishes have like a thousand things and sometimes there not good because of all the extra ingredients like the fudgesicle there were these weird green circles that were gross that ruined the dish"
"So happy to have discovered dusek's! Just going to preface this by saying it was probably the best late brunch I've ever had, so essentially lunch and I was really hungry, but still. They reserve half of their restaurant for people without reservations so our wait was pretty short. I immediately took a liking to this place just based on their decor and historic vibe, but it was the food that really won me over. I really just wanted to order everything off the menu, but ended up going for the duck confit sandwich and couldn't be more pleased. The bun was divine, not too greasy and just the right amount of chew. I'm a huge sucker for fried eggs on sandwiches and burgers so that was obviously a plus. The fennel and arugula gave it a bit of crunch in each bite but I think what really did it for me was the duck, gruyere mornay and beer mustard. The flavors were absolutely spot on and came together so cohesively. I downed it and moved on to the fries, which were equally amazing. I dipped some in the remaining gruyere mornay sauce left on the plate which was so good, and even just the fries plain or with ketchup was amazing. They weren't too salty which is what I saw a few people on here say about them but we're just the slightest bit crispy - just how I like them! The meal really filled me up and I can't wait to come back and try more off their menu. Their service was also reasonably fast and they really boast a strong alcohol assortment. I'm also looking forward to coming back here for their $1 oyster happy hours on Mondays because my friend tried their oysters and definitely put my midwestern seafood concern to rest."
We have been here once before and my French toast was amazing!  So we are back today for my birthday brunch and I'm excited!
"If you have yet to visit Dusek's, get yourself over to Pilsen now and give them a try. Dinner or brunch, you can't go wrong. Their Roasted PEI Mussels with smoked pimenton and warm harissa butter some of the best mussels I've ever eaten and I would order their scallops every single time. We had a bad experience with their short ribs, but hopefully they've since corrected that dish.As for desserts, the Fried Stout and Chocolate Bar are standouts. For brunch, start with one of their Beermosas and try the Dutch Baby with seasonal fruit, Juicy Lucy, Omelet, Eggs Benedict...the list goes on, it's all so good! Definitely worth the extra effort to get here for those that don't live nearby."
"mussels mussels mussels!  Get the mussels!I have come all the way from California to be the seafood snob and state.. seafood just generally sucks in the Midwest.  If it's good, it's expensive. If it's affordable, it's just not the same!  But DANG - Dusek's mussels are affordable and are, not just good, but GREAT.  They're super meaty and substantial. The seasoning will tickle every salty lovers fancy.  I was bloated from head to toe from all the water retention but mmm, it was worth it.  Just make sure to take your selfies beforehand =PAs for everything else... we also got the steak and eggs.  It was more like a sampling of food and I'm appalled it even tried to disguise itself as a real meal.  Skip, please.  The duck fat fries were good but they're pretty standard as far as fries go. Service was also underpar.  Our server kept forgetting orders (sides and drinks) and even forgot it the second time when we kindly told him we didn't receive the order yet.  I'm not one to hold a restaurant back if they have great food.. but it seems like you really have to choose your selection wisely here.I'll definitely be back but only because the mussels are so yummy!"
"I've been wanting to try Dusek's for their amazing take on the Juicy Lucy burger.  I enticed my Hubby to go for their equally good liquor and beer selection.  To beat the lines we went around 5pm on Friday night, no wait at all.We started with the Iron Roasted P.E.I. Taylor Mussels - simply delicious with a kick.  Definitely a unique way to serve mussels that were smoky, spicy, and accompanied by a nice warm butter dipping sauce.  We then split the Pork Belly with pea risotto.  The pork was juicy, tender, and cut like butter.  My mouth is watering remembering how yummy it was.  Perfectly paired with the refreshing pea risotto so I could rationalize to myself how semi-healthy the dish was.  We ended with the Juicy Lucy which came with the beef fat fries.  I was a little disappointed since it seemed the meat had cooled down a bit (the cheese in the middle wasn't as gooey), so I think they were waiting for us to finish our other dishes before bringing out the burger.  Despite that, it was a good burger.  The size was just right, not too big or daunting.  The bun was able to withstand the burger thickness and juiciness without getting soggy.  The red onion bacon marmalade was the perfect topping.  The beef fat fries were a little rich for me.  For dessert we tried the Cookie Dough, a deconstructed take on cookie dough with ice cream.  It was okay, maybe it was the textures that bothered me.  Overall, my favorite dishes were the mussels and the pork belly.Service was attentive and friendly.  It wasn't too busy so the server came around once in a while to check on us without hovering.  Hubby enjoyed his two drinks - I can't believe they have a chocolate milkshake stout (have to try it after the baby is born).  I had to settle on smelling it.  I can finally cross off Dusek's from my Best of Chicago Burger Bucket list!"
"More on the higher end of bars/restaurants in the Pilsen neighborhood. Although I have yet to go there for brunch as I heard great things about it, I did go there for drinks and small appetizers at night. Place is dark, has a good vibe and nice ambiance- not a bad place to take a date to. From my understanding there is also a bar area downstairs--can't miss it on your way to the women's bathroom. Although it was hard to hear due to the surrounding noise level, I do appreciate that the food runners described each plate that came out. I worked at a restaurant before that required me to do that and I understand the amount of studying that is needed to do what he did. I have to come back for brunch!"
"Nice bar area. A good spot to go if you are attending an event at the Thalia Hall. I ordered one of their cocktails, I think it's called the honey cup (?). It was good and refreshing. Perfect for summer. Only 4 stars because there's really nothing else to do  around the area. And I feel like the area is a little ""shady"". But will try to return in the future to  check out their food menu."
"I came here for a double date brunch a couple weekends ago since I had a $10 voucher from the Chicago a la Card promotion, and enjoyed the meal. I ordered the ham and 3 egg benedict, and although it was good, it was not actually a ham and egg benedict by any means. The menu advertises hollandaise, but whether it actually doesn't come with it or they simply forgot to put any on my plate, what I had was 3 eggs on toast. Also, while technically prosciutto is an Italian ham, just say it comes topped with prosciutto so it's clear that people are not getting what we typically ACTUALLY refer to as ham in America. Be as fancy as you want, but be accurate and honest.  Other than that, my fiance got the Challah French Toast, which I wish I had ordered instead - very fluffy, not too much syrup, and the mint leaves added a great taste. Our friends ordered the lobster pot pie, which had a huge hunk of claw meat right on top the second you dug into it, looked yummy, and some sort of spicy chocolate donut. Overall, while I was a little disappointed by the fake eggs benedict, I'd definitely go back to try their dinner menu."
"Pros:The food and drinks were excellent. The oysters were outstanding! Cons:The service could have been better. Only saw our server for our order and check.Final Verdict:Recommend. Perhaps, it was long day for our server. But we will definitely be making our trip back here soon."
The food is amazing.  The deserts are so delicious.  The ambiance nice and relaxing.  The bar down stairs is so cozy and romantic
"On my recent and very important mission (to try as many brunch places as possible), I stumbled across Dusek's. I loved their hanging chandelier and rustic chic decor. Their menu was also different than your typical benedicts and waffles kind of place. I tried the Scotch Egg which is a soft boiled egg, wrapped in lamb sausage, breaded and deep fried. If that didn't blow your mind already, what until you try it! Surprisingly it was alot lighter than it sounds since it was served with an assortment veggies. The poached egg was perfectly cooked and still runny. I also tried the beignets. The exterior was crisp and inside was really soft and pillowy. I couldn't taste the pie spice and wished they were filled with jam or something. Overall, the service and experience was great and I'd definitely come back."
Could there be a better place to have New Years brunch?!  This is it!!Bloody Mary A+Crab dip B-Hash AShrimp and grit A (should come with more girts)Benedict A-Coffee A++++ love it
Great place to o get drinks at. Not only are the drunks good but the food is really good too.
"I've come to Dusek's a few times only to be met with long waits and an insanely crowded bar. My friend and I tried our luck last week on a weeknight and it worked out very well! No crowds, no wait and even empty tables abound. Dusek's is pricey but the food is quite good. +Olives $6 - Ummmmm, that is a whole lot of olives. We could only get halfway through the bowl. It seriously is a huge thing of millions of olives, all different types, warmed up. This might be a good item if you're just having beers but it was olive overload for us.+Lamb Bolognese $16 - Really good dish. Lamb was cooked well and all the ingredients (and there were a ton) went well together.+Pumpkin Risotto $16 - Again a million ingredients. I have a feeling a lot of their dishes have tons of ingredients which I'm sure sometimes hits and sometimes misses. The pumpkin risotto was somewhere inbetween. The risotto itself was delicious and had just the right amount of pumpkin in it. Then there a lot of chunks of pumpkin strewn on top...a few too many chunks. There were also other random ingredients thrown on top some of which went well with the dish, others that did not.+Good beer menu! The beers are slightly on the pricey side compared to other places but they have a lot of good local brews. I had a Pig Minds Joe Daddy for $7 and a Penrose Spectral for $6.Dusek's is somewhere I wouldn't hesitate to go back to. Quality food and I like that they aim to hit balls out of the park with their unique combinations though admittedly it does sometimes miss. Do like I did and go on a weekday to avoid the crowds!"
"I've seen several tv shows and web articles praising this place.  As someone who is always in search of the best burgers in the city heard that Dusek's juicy Lucy stands worthy to be in that category.  Au Cheval is my gold standard, with Kuma's running a close second, and Bad Apple being my minimum to qualify between impressive and just a good burger.  The Lucy is prepared and cooked well, but is short of my list.  The fries are great but unfortunately was over salted.  I'm the type to believe in second chances, and hoping that they are top of their game the next time I visit."
"Good overall...just know that portions are not massive and for seafood lovers, mussels are a must!"
"Really wanted to try the dinner menu here but unfortunately, we had to ""settle"" for their amazing lunch menu! #NextTimeJuicy Lucy: 6/5 (this is probably one of my top 3 all time favorite hamburgers. Add in the fact that you have ridiculously delicious duck fat fries, it definitely earns a 6 out of 5!) Crab and artichoke dip: 5/5 (pleasantly surprised but the hefty chunks of crab meat)"
"What a great job of taking typical dishes and mixing it up with interesting flavors! We split the cinnamon rolls - an adorable little thing covered in lemon glaze. Next up was the challah french toast, which was airy and light (more like a cake than french toast). The breakfast sandwich with chorizo and salsa was huge and flavorful. My only complaint was the fries were a little too squishy for me and didn't have a lot of flavor, although the boy liked them just fine. For a place that is All About the Beer, we were pleasantly surprised to find an extensive spirits menu with pretty good prices. That plus the mostly delish food will probably lure us back."
"They've switched things up a little bit since my last visit here, but I loved it none the less.  One improvement was denoting the vegetarian options on the menu as it used to be a minefield as they use animal fat in some dishes unexpectedly.  A concert in Thalia Hall bought me here for dinner and it was a good before the show experience.The place usually gets a little packed before a concert, still we were able to get seated pretty quickly.  It also happened to be Fat Tuesday so I ended up getting to try their special inteterptation of a jambalaya.  It was one of those refined interpetations that more or less lightly reminded you of the dish it described rather than being an authentic.  Was it delicious? Yes.  Was it Jambalaya? No.As far as the drinks are concerned, I also remember them being better.  They were more or less kind of ok and didn't really invoke the flavors that you would think would command their $10-12 price tag."
"An unassuming foodie hotspot tucked in the Pilsen neighborhood. They don't accept reservations; however, with a party of 2 your wait is minimal if not nonexistent. Arrive right at opening (at 5pm) and you'll be seated almost immediately, regardless of party size.Their menu changes seasonally- including drinks and dessert. For something fun, try 'the ordinary'- an homage to original pub fare (a pre-selected entree with a side beer). Tip: try at least one mixed drink and make room for dessert- both menu items show pride in craftsmanship."
"ALERT ALERT ALERT. Foodie hotspot in an unassuming location. Tucked away in Pilsen is the dimly lit, sexy Dusek's. Went with 3 other people and split a few plates -- we each ordered one. In batting order:1. Country ham sampler (my choice, and the best): this was incredible. I'm a fan of all things from a pig. Served with warm, buttery sourdough toast, we got a board full of jamon Serrano, prosciutto, and speck. Aka the three best pork cuts. There's butter and whole grain mustard on the board for your pleasure. We did have to buy a few extra rounds of sourdough. WORTH IT. 2. Roasted crystal valley farms half chicken: pretty decent. Smoky flavor. Comes with potato salad that everyone else loved (I'm not a fan in general). I claimed the dark meat so I got the better deal. 3. Chanterelle risotto: very good. Flavorful, creamy, and that tomato herb broth... I'm telling ya, you can't go wrong. 4. Wild boar ragu: HEEEYYY GIRL YOU FINE. That is what I actually said in the first bite. Turns out I like boar. After all, pig parts, am I right? The boar was the best part and the ragu the weakest, but you won't hear me complain. And if you thought I was done, guess what? DESSERT!!5. Roasted chili Churros: that bittersweet chocolate sorbet does it. It's the strangest taste and so good with the spicy-aftertaste pastry. But then I tasted...6. Cookie dough: it's like little logs of the dough sans-chocolate, and then ALL THINGS CHOCOLATE in addition. Chocolate cream, chocolate chips, and crumbled cookie. Plus that egg custard. How can I get me some o' dat?The only (hardly) downside: we showed up at 7pm and didn't get seated until 8:30. Once we had a table, our server thought our service was slow so he gave us free drink tokens. I love him. Will someone give me his number? To see how we killed 90 minutes waiting for a table, just go downstairs! (Or to the Punch House yelp page)"
"Wonderful  evening at Dusek's -Hosted a private party in the private room, with a moving walk (secret passage) the location / Room was amazing. I worked with Emma on the menus and she was so nice, all was arranged via phone and email as I'm from NY. The menu seamed interesting and I was worried it might not be a fit for my guest, well I was wrong every course and every dish was outstanding.  I would highly recommend this place.  Great food, beautiful  room, outstanding service!"
"This was only my second time eating at a restaurant in Pilson, but I was impressed by Dusek's. My wife and I went with another couple and we started off with some olives and pickles with bread. The olives were delicious and not too sour while the pickles had a lot of variety in the jar that was provided and were also tasty.For the main course, I had the half chicken meal that was served with potato salad. The chicken was flavorful and very tender, and the potato salad was the best I have ever had. It was not too creamy and provided the exact amount of sweet and savory. Overall, I had a great time and will definitely come back."
"Dusek's -- you've taken the prize for 1) saltiest food in Chicago 2) worst service ever experienced in my life. Congratulations! I came here on a Friday night -- yes it's busy, but the waiter didn't stop ONCE to ask us how our food was. We ordered the duck confit, pork belly, and the mussels. The pork belly was seriously the saltiest food I've ever ordered. When I complained, the waiter then delivered us bread and CHARGED us for it. After not stopping by our table ONCE to refill water... (instead the busboys did it), we complained again. He didn't stop by again. A dinner that should have taken an hour and a half ended up taking two and a half hours because of TERRIBLE service. No tip left. The sauerkraut on the duck confit was also SO salty. I couldn't bear it. It was truly a disgrace. The mussels were also so small, not fresh, and the shell was overly salted. The only saving grace of the night was when the manager came over after hearing our complaints and gave us a round of drinks and dessert on the house. Thank you. It was much appreciated. The churro was really delicious actually, and it made the night a little better.Still, the service was such a turn-off, I don't think I'll be coming back. Such a shame because the table next to ours also complained about how off that night was. The waiter told them that they could cut their lobster roll themselves and that they were definitely not getting better service because they asked for something else because the scallops were sold out. RUDE. We bemoaned our mutual dislike for the waiter together. And that was our night... :("
"It disappoints me to have to come down on Dusek's, but the value of Yelp is knowing about the experiences of others -- good or bad.And in this case, brunch yesterday at Dusek's wasn't that good.I had been to Dusek's for dinner (a few days after it opened), and the meal was spectacular. (And I'd really expect nothing less since L&E is very consistently good.)We ordered a cinnamon roll and beignets to start; the cinnamon roll was not served warm and, as a result, was kind of dry. The beignets stood alone; they were decent but some fruit or chocolate dip would have strengthened them immensely.The oyster hash had no real flavor profile but salt, salt and more salt. It was also quite dark and dirty looking, making it a rather unappetizing dish.The burger was okay, and the fries were good. (But it's just burger and fries.)Steak and eggs were decent, but nothing memorable. Same can be said about the eggs benedict. There's just way too much salt going on and not a lot of flavor. I felt like there wasn't even a real chef in the kitchen, just a bunch of people following charts/recipes and putting food on plates.I'd have a hard time returning to Dusek's unless I happen to get some rave reviews from friends whose dining advice I trust. Otherwise, I'm not rushing back."
"Really love the atmosphere and food at Dusek's. The staff is always friendly and in point with their recommendations. Bob the bartender is great as is the host and our server Chris. I love the pretzel, oysters, and especially the seafood tower. Great. Awesome beer selection and great food pairings to go along with it.  All around nice place.Check out the Punch Room in the basement for some good tunes and interesting drink concoctions."
"Terrific space, you're happy the moment you enter.  Unfortunately for us, lots of hipsters with babies the morning we brunched here.  But we weren't sorry we came.  Terrific menu, we loved everything we ordered.  We sampled from their excellent beer list and enjoyed some brunch-y  cocktails as well & were pleased with the whole experience (especially glad we sat at the bar, putting the maximum space between us and the babies)."
"I never thought I'd eat amazing seafood in the Midwest. I'm a California girl through and through, and I LOVE my fishies! But Duesks is pretty amazing.The staff was SO knowledgable, and honestly treated us like guests in their home. Every question was answered, and their suggestions were SPOT ON.We started with the crab dip, and went with the seafood tier to finish. Lobster, oysters, prawn, clams and mussels. And holey moley, it was ALL amazing. Their seafood is flown in 6 days a week! And it is served at a very fair price. ($30?!? For all that delicious?YASSSS!)I wish SF had a Duseks. Le sigh."
"Major disappointment.My group of four and my 9-month-old daughter dropped by for lunch yesterday; this was my second visit to the building, since I had drinks at Punch House over the summer.  We got three different entrees--the french toast, the oyster hash, and ""The Ordinary"", which was a pork/egg/salad/chorizo/multi-everything open-faced $18 sandwich.  We also tried a couple of the beermosas and the Brunch Punch.First, the french toast was awful; as you will see from my other reviews, I eat out quite a bit, and this is the worst french toast I have had in Chicago.  Easy.  I don't know what happened because the menu description, ""Challah French Toast: maple fromage, bacon streusel, bourbon apple compote"", made my mouth water...then the dish comes out and is essentially three small slivers of toast with the toppings mentioned on challah that either wasn't fresh or wasn't prepared properly.  Incredibly dry, even with the spreadable compote or the un-fraiche fromage.Second, all of the dishes were hilariously small, like comically small...a better way to describe the brunch offerings at Dusek's is to say that they are small plates.  (To our server's credit, he did really push ordering more than four entrees for our group, but for the prices, I just assumed that $11 french toast would be enough for a normal adult male to eat and feel satisfied!!!)  From watching other tables and their orders, it's clear that the lunch items are the way to get a regular-size portion.As a result, everyone who tasted it agreed that the Oyster Hash was amazing...but so small that my one friend though he would have needed to order three of them to fill up.  Three???  Also, yesterday's ""Ordinary"" received high marks but for $18, it's a bit spendy for a brunch meal.We dropped about $110 for this brunch and all of us left hungry...we did have a $10 discount card through A La Card so that took a small part of the sting away but I won't be back to eat here, ever.  Now, drinks at Punch House?  Definitely!"
"Nice place, very nice decor. Big rooms and perfect location! Love Pilsen!!!Went there for brunch. It was good but nothing that we tried blew my mind! But i can clearly see that they are trying to make things different from the standard adding something special in the dishes, that sometimes works but others doesn't.I would definitely go back and reccomend, especially to people that like Pilsen."
"Just finished having brunch here. Definitely a hidden gem that'll recommend to all my friends. My husband had the Rarebit Benedict and I had the Breakfast Sandwich. I must say the Benedict dish was perfectly crafted, delicious! Mine was awesome too a bit on the spicy side, I would have accompanied it with something dairy-like such as yogurt or similar to cut the hotness (that's why I didn't give it the 5 stars) but it was still delish!To accompany our low-caloric diet we ordered a side of beignets (a deep-fried pastry) which were AMAZING! Make sure to have them when you come.Service was great and our waiter did an excellent job at describing each dish."
"I've been here like a bajillion times already and I can't wait to go back again and again and again. Everything is delicious. Seriously, I've had everything on the menu. It's all delicious. BUT....if I was forced to pick a few favorites...well, IF I had toGeneral Tso's sweetbread: basically exactly as it sounds like. Crispy sweetbread in a tangy GT sauceWarm Brandade: very light fish taste...basically like the best, savory mashed potatoes you've ever hadBlue Crab Dip: yum. just..yum. Octopus Confit: This is my favorite dish. Hands down.Choucroute: a meat lovers dreamTagine: best cous cous ever. So many delectables veggies.Bavette of beef: kind of like a beef wellington, but updated. really fantasticMussels: The harissa sauce is very delicious but it's a mostly dry sauce..so don't expect to dip your bread in it to sop up all the sauce. There isn't any. Fantastic beer list, great cocktails. LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE this place."
Been here twice in three days. Lower level. Drinks & appetizer. Most importantly the DJ has been ok fiyah!! Great vibes cool energy...credit to the DJ. I'll come here for the music #1 the punch #1.5 and the ambiance #2. The snack food is great as well! Duseks doing a great job at satisfying your crowd.Thank you
"Reminds me of one of those places that is trying just a little too hard to fit in to the current hipster trend.  Pretty uninventive menu amongst their peers - stuffed cheese pretzel, $16 crab dip, burrata, mussels, sweetbreads, burger.  All trendy, but nothing too unique to stand out. Plus, execution had some missteps.  Some vegetables were undercooked in our burrata, the pretzel & fries didn't take any creative turns taste-wise (I love a homemade mustard or jazzed up ketchup!), it was all just fine.I said all this to my husband and he called me a douche, but tis the truth - douchetruth.  I enjoyed my time there but wouldn't hurry back - which, notably, is exactly what 2 of my friends who went with said who had been there before - they only returned bc I really wanted to try it.The cocktail menu, however, is very inventive, unique and tasty, and service was great."
"I want to give this spot 3.5 stars but I cannot, not quiet a 4. Good spot in Pilsen. If you love beer, definitely make a stop here. The food is also pretty delicious. One of the best mussels I've had in the city! Skip the oysters, very fishy and they were not cleaned very well. The sweetbread dish was conceptually confusing and itself was dry. The juicy Lucy burger was ok, too much bread for me and not a fan of fake cheese inside the burger. The fried ramp dish surprisingly really good! Also, the olive and the pickle dishes were simple but really good. I would skip the specialty cocktails, tried four different ones and none of them I enjoyed. Very much beer based cocktails. Get their specialty gin and tonic or just stick to the beer."
"We enjoyed this place immensely. The menu is unique, but not gimmicky, and everything we had was very good. I especially recommend ""The Ordinary"", but our waitress was very gracious in taking time to tell is about the menu. Decor and atmosphere were also very nice with one minor exception: it was too dark to read the menu for tables not near windows."
"From the folks that brought you Longman & Eagle comes Dusek's, one of a few sprouting gastropubs in the gentrifying neighborhood called the Pilsen. Though L&E has been on my bucket list since forever, it's hard to find a non-peak time to make the hike down to Logan Square. Similarly, Dusek's comes with the caveat of EXPECT LONG WAIT TIMES if you're going on a Friday or Saturday evening. Not so much for a spontaneous weekday dinner, though.The space is actually larger than I expected, especially since the last time I called--Friday evening, natch--I was quoted a two-and-a-half hour wait time. It's gastropub decor: dim lighting, wood everywhere. Service, for us, started a little slow but picked up nicely.The menu is elevated bar food, but think of it more along the lines of The Publican than a simple dressed up burger or fish & chips. Drinks are plentiful. There are roughly 24 draft taps full of your favorite bubbly libation. There's also an ample cocktail and wine list, as well as the full bar. If that doesn't satiate enough, there's an afterparty downstairs at the jointly owned Punch House.As for the food, it made my mouth whet in anticipation of a trip to L&E. The wife and I split two apps and two mains, first going with the blue crab dip and broccolini. The crab dip was good, not spectacular. I would preferred slightly less salt and slightly more cream, but that's minute picking. I really liked the broccolini, as it was flavored exceptionally well and topped with some of the most delicious toasted pine nuts I've encountered.Yes, I'm one of those foodie suckers for a perfect fried egg, and that which topped the duck meatloaf looked and tasted divine. The meatloaf tasted like elevated spam, which I swear is a complement. The sides were similarly amazing, with a lightly salted pommes duchesse and some braised green beans that had to be simmering in some sort of meat broth. The wife's risotto looked petite but packed a wallop, and after two hearty appetizers, she found some of it saved for a meal the next day.Like other gastropubs around Chicago, Dusek's puts a dent in the walltet. Unlike other gastropubs around Chicago, I daresay Dusek's is worth it."
"The best grilled mussels in Chicago live here. The mussels taste charred, smokey, their shells are encrusted with amazing seasoned salt, and the drawn butter that you dip these babies in is sinfully delicious. For the rest of dinner, try porchetta and veggie tagine. The craft beer and cocktails list is also spot on, and goes great with this decadent dining experience. The 5 stars review for Duseks is earned by the aforementioned amazing dishes. There were some duds though. I did NOT like the sweetbreads. The delicate taste of the sweetbreads was completely masked by general tsao's sauce, and it was overfried to the point that it tasted grainy and nothing like sweetbreads. The crab dip not bad, but did come out a bit lukewarm. Avoid! Just order a couple orders of the mussels instead!"
"Chicago is definitely known for it's hidden gems, and Dusek's is no exception. This place is nestled in the middle of a w 18th street with various surroundings in Pilsen. I mean I can honestly say I am not sure I would just walk up and down the street or ride around all willy-nilly. Yet, when you walk into this restaurant, it's like a whole new world.Ambiance: This place is lively, homey, casual, hipster like. The tables are nestled closely together, people are intensely focused on their conversations and dinner companions, and the music piping in the background is just loud enough for you to sway your shoulders and not know way. Service: Service was all around amazing. From first entrance into the restaurant to the bartenders, wait staff, and those in between. I opted to sit at the bar and while it was slow to get started it ramped up and was excellent. Barney was my ""main"" point of contact but it really was a team effort here. My glasses were kept full, I had olives and mussels, and the wait staff kept my bowls empty, and everyone wanted to make sure you were enjoying yourself. Most importantly, people were familiar with the menu, I mean REALLY familiar which is nice. The icing on the cake is when someone asks do you have any dietary restrictions before they start making recommendations!Food: Presentation, Portions, Pricing, and Taste were awesome! My food selections:Wood Roasted Olives: I have never had these before and they were addicting. Variety of olives, warm to the center, and just tasty! I had to have them take them away before I wouldn't eat my entree.Broccolini: Toasted pine nuts, pickled radish, golden raisin. They nailed it on all cylinders. The flavors melted in your mouth. The texture of the broccolini was perfect. They came out before my mussels and I just couldn't wait after I had a taste.Mussels: The server talked about how the mussels and I took a chance. They were heavenly. I can't remember how they were prepared, but I ate the entire serving (and it was huge) without hesitation. Job well done.I had the a grapefruit craft cocktail and a glass of wine (blend), which were interesting. I think I'll continue to overindulge in the food. I'll definitely be back for dessert they sounded amazing!!Great experience. Can't wait to get back."
"First, I just have to say that the Three Ham Eggs Benedict on their house sourdough is really, hands-down my favorite breakfast in Chicago.  It's unfairly delicious and one of the most satisfying hangover meals I think I've ever had.Ok, now that's out of the way.  I remember being very excited to hear that the Longman and Eagle folks were taking over the mediocre pizzeria that used to occupy that space.  Also, that they had an interest in renovating Thalia Hall and turning into a music venue has also endeared me to them.  For those who don't know Thalia Hall dates back to the Chicago World Fair, a super old building with a lot of history and they've done a beautiful job renovating it.  Anyway...I do have to say that I think I prefer the breakfast there to the dinner.  I still have yet to have a dinner there that has impressed me for the price.  Some of the menu items seemed to have grand ambitions but fell short for me in terms of flavor and quantity for the price.  I've heard the Juicy Lucy talked about many times, but when I ordered it, it was a pretty forgettable burger with a lump of congealed cheese in the center.  Never again.  The duck fat fries were very tasty, but I haven't had a dinner item there that I've raved about in my several visits.That being said, come check this place out. Their eggs benedict is unforgettable, the beer list is bold, the scotch egg is delicious, the atmosphere is charming, the staff is great, and the neighborhood is phenomenal.  Give it a try."
"I definitely will NOT come back.  We were seated around 10:50AM and the restaurant inside was not that busy.  Food did not arrive until after 11:35.   Waited over half an hour for two dishes.  One was lukewarm, the other had hash that was outright cold.  I sent one dish back and told them I didn't want it replaced, I just wanted the check.  They tried to ask me what they could do so ""short of taking the dish returned off the bill.""  Was the manager/head waiter joking?What a joke to have front of house staff so incompetent at this tier of restaurant.Pretty clear to me they either forgot to put in the order or they forget to deliver the food as opposed to the kitchen being backed up.  They never explained anything and just kept providing empty apologies."
"Last minute decision to come eat here with some friends and it was one of the best decisions. The ambiance was great! The servers are friendly. We decided to try a few things on the menu between the 4 of us. Mussels-Best Grilled Mussels in Chicago, great portion and the smoky flavor was unreal. Charred baby octopus- This was really good. The flavors meshed togetherGeneral Tso's Sweetbreads- My friends said these were okay nothing to rave about.Country Ham Sampler:Speck - Italy & Serrano - Spain these hams were really goodThe Virginia I could do without, it was meh.Fries- Beef fat fries, they are absolutely amazing but  I like most fries."
"Items selected:Gemuse Gimlet - Death's Door Gin, Fresh Line Sour, Ginger, Celery, HefeweisenGeneral Tso's Sweetbreads - wood roasted shishito peppers, pickled daikon, pea tendrilWarm Brandade - pickled red melrose, charred cippollini relish, beef fat chipsRoasted Blue Crab Dip - artichoke relish, housemade pain d'epiStuffed Pretzel - beer cheeseChoucroute - duck confit, house garlic sausage, fresh bacon, confit red potatoes, sauerkraut, caraway pickled appleIced CoffeeCookie Dough - fernet chocolate chips, egg custard ice cream, mint, chocolate cremeux, cookie powderFruit Loop Donut - lemongrass buttermilk sorbet, guava puree, lychee, freeze dried strawberry and grapefruit powder, coconutChocolate sourdough pudding - strawberry water gelee, strawberry air, gingersnap, chocolate syrup, fried strawberry, orange blossom gelatoMoscato d'Asti D.O.C.GOriginally slotted as a late night Saturday stop for four only to be replaced last minute by a trip to The Promontory it was perhaps fate that led me and a friend to our seat at Dusek's on Sunday night, the ""Sunday Noodles"" menu at Takashi not particularly interesting when we'd originally planned to partake in some of the chef's more esoteric options that are apparently only offered on other nights of the week.    Located in Pilsen and accessed best by Uber it was just after 6:45 that my buddy and I crossed the threshold of the reinvented space and quickly seated at a charming two-top near the windows farthest from the noise it would not be long before our server stopped by, the beercentric menu of mostly sharable plates described at great lengths with a resultant 8 plate order plus a trio of beverages coursed out just as requested, the timing and presentation of all but one item on par with that of Michelin Starred restaurants despite the otherwise relaxed atmosphere.  Truly a restaurant where adventurous palates are rewarded for their efforts it was with a sizeable plate strewn with three spicy sweetbreads that our meal began and with the offal impeccably tender beneath crispy coating we subsequently rolled into a duo of spreads, the potato and salt cod composition a reference standard with housemade crisps while the cheesy crab found levity in tender artichokes that worked nicely with whole wheat bread.   Admittedly a bit underwhelmed by a pretzel that I felt could use a bit more salt our savories soon culminated with a large plate of mixed meats and utilizing the combination of 'kraut and pickled apple to cleanse the palate between bites one would be hard pressed to select a 'best' amongst the three - a similar circumstance arising amongst the trio of desserts where only the fact that we were not informed that the lychee was still 'shell-on' prevented everything from being perfect, a single bitter bite rectified by striking the ""froot loop donut"" from our bill and sweetening the deal with free glasses of Moscato to pair with two puddings that no one should miss, the 'cookie dough' particularly enthralling with textures galore and the fernet chips melding beautifully with the mint and egg custard into a sort of coffee-tinged note than lingered on the palate for nearly the whole ride home."
"I definitely need to explore their menu a bit more but from what I had, it's pretty good. The waitress was very attentive, the drinks are delicious and the one dish we did try was good. Nothing out of this world, but good. I think the drinks probably take center stage here, at least for me they do. I've spent most of my time in this building downstairs at Punch House and now that Thalia Hall is open for concerts, I hope to be here more often. A warning to the wise, parking is very difficult in this area, so if you're meeting someone here, make sure you allow enough time to find parking."
"The space is wonderful and the drinks are cool - both beers and spirits. The food is a little hit or miss. Some things I've loved and others seem a little too meaty and bland. The desserts are really good, although very sweet. Not such a fan of their brunch offerings either - yeah this kind of makes it sound like i don't like their food much, but they do have some good offerings. However, i'd rather go here for a drink than dinner."
late lunch on Sunday and was so impressed.  Food is fantastic.  Liked the ambiance and server was pleasant as well.  good job.
"Dear Dusek's, I'm really sorry I don't have sleeves of ink or a beard like the rest of you unique snow flakes. Making me wait 30 minutes for a neat drink and being snubbed by your bartenders when the place is not busy is probably not something the owners had in mind. There were 3 of them too. Mixology my arse! These punks were pumping every drink out of taps, everything is premixed, all these glorious bartenders did was shave a lemon, something they picked up in prison while pealing potatoes. What a joke! To top off the night of hipster bottom scraping, the juicy Lucy made my friend literally vomit outside while we waited 20 minutes for our cab.  This is about the worst place I have ever been to. Terrible service, food that literally made us ill and you can't catch a cab back to civilization. Might as well go to Red Robin in Naperville or some other suburb. Never again!P.S. Putting that much hot pepper on muscles totally overpowers the delicate flavor of them, might as well put sharp cheddar on lobster. Foodie nightmare"
"I came here for the pre fix v day menu and was pleasantly surprised. Liked the food, but loved the drinks ambiance and music more."
"A drinks place (cocktails below $10), food is a casualty.  The $$ you save in parking and cab goes to Duserk's food prices.  A suburban vibe with a touch of common cosmopolitan dishes.Sweet Bread ($16) -- good snack portion that is hidden by overly sweet sauce with a touch of hot spice.  West Loop restaurant priced it at $14 with same free parking concept.Churros ($8) -- 3 pcs of 2-inch sticks and a dollop of house made ice cream.  You are gouged!  It's still on the sweet and spicy taste category.Dark Matter Coffee ($2.50) -- you have to ask for refill and it doesn't arrive.  I got the vibe it's a per cup serving and price.Service -- good, informative and pleasant.Venue -- feels like a cleaned up pool hall.  You can stay here all night.  Dinner.  Conversation.  Dancing.  It's still 2012 at Duserk's -- the menu, prices and small dish with big price concept.  Ouch!"
"This place is almost perfect. I have been here three times, so I feel I can make a fair assessment.The entrees are mostly yummy. Highlights: lobster roll, juicy Lucy, beef-fat fried French fries. Lowlight: mac & cheese. Too herby and soupy. Not my style.The desserts: all good! They change around a bit, but my table mates and myself have never been disappointed. Guava donut and chocolate bar were both great.I'm not a big drinker, but I've been told their beer selection is good.The only thing I would change is the service. It always seems our waiter or waitress is MIA when needed, and it takes forever to get the check. But, I guess it's nice they don't try to chase you out!"
"Definitely a Pilsen gem. The absolute standout? The mussels. Oh my gosh, THE MUSSELS!!! Our party of 5 originally had one order as an appetizer to share, but ended up ordering another bowl because it was just THAT good."
"I don't usually venture into Pilsen for my late night outings, especially on a cold snowy day, but Duseks is a good enough reason to start!  My friend and I decided to put our name down for a table after it seemed we were going to stand forever downstairs at Punch House. I immediately loved the decor and elegant atmosphere of Duseks. We waited about a half hour before getting seated and ordered half a dozen oysters and slurped these babies down!  We also had quail covered in delicious gravy and cornbread. The plates on the menu are all good for sharing.  Very friendly and attentive service. I definitely can see myself coming back here."
"Loved the beer selection and the menu's descriptions - pinpoints the taste and eliminates having to ask the bartender any questions.  Food was great - the mussels and oysters (though I'm not a huge oyster fan) tasted fresh.  I highly recommend the Lamb Bolognese - the gnocchi was perfectly light and fluffy, and the chunks of ricotta complimented and cut the richness of the sauce.  The cookie dough dessert was also great.  I wasn't happy about the hour wait, but the food and drinks made up for it."
"Cocktails, perfectly cooked pork, amazing appetizers. This place has it going on.We did the prefix menu and boy were we blown away. Everything was made on point. If you have an opportunity to try the pork loin, it'll be a life moment you should not dare pass up. It's seriously frickin' amaze-balls.In the drink realm, I absolutely love the way they do their gimlets. It basically lets you taste the gin up front with a subtle ginger lemon aftertaste. Try it.And while you're at it, give the owners a pat on the back for delivering such quality without the price point to burn a new hole in your wallet. Value at its best."
"This is everything.  A cool spot, cool neighborhood, really classy inside but without being too full of itself.  Most importantly the service is excellent as well as the cocktails and food.We had the crab dip.  It was amazing.  Like what you want crab dip to be all hot and gooey.  We also had some pickles which are always good when they're made there.  Then we tried this chicken dish that was amazing.  The menu changes often so I'm sure its something different now.  The smell attracted the people sitting around us who said, ooohhh what is that?!  I had a couple of bourbon bucks which is not too adventurous but made very well."
"Only went for a late drink but looks like authentic hipster elegance, décor and vibe. Good interesting cocktails.  I'll be back for the food.  It's definitely a destination."
"We came here after work one day because it's kinda sorta on the way home and we'd heard good things.  But it turns out this isn't just a good place to go if you are in the neighborhood; this is the kind of place that makes you want to *move* to the neighborhood.We tried so many things that listing them is almost embarrassing.  Catfish with succotash and fennel remoulade was cohesive and delicious; the lobster roll and fries was decadent and delicious; the cod, the oysters, the pickles, all delicious.  The only disappointment was a panzanella salad that was bland and too much lettuce.  On top of this, Dusek's has an extremely interesting list of over a dozen quite obscure draft beers, and some great cocktails too.  Their gin-lime-celery cocktail is basically a perfect thing.  And of course the service is friendly, the sidewalk patio is the perfect place to hang out on a beautiful summer night, etc., etc.It feels weird to say it, but I think this might actually be better than the team's more famous venture at Longman & Eagle."
"I will definitely come back, not just for the food, but to try a drink and perhaps doodle on the chalkboard walls downstairs (maybe not necessarily the ones lining the bathroom stall, but hey, that's a good time passer too).I decided the $22 price tag on the lobster roll was acceptable, and that was my entree for the night.  It was delicious!  The duck fat fries were tre tasty too.  I do have to say that the mussels rank among the most flavorful I've ever consumed in my life, and I am working myself up to be a mussel connoisseur. Expect: dim lighting, lively atmosphere, plentiful menu (and bar), street parking."
"This must be more of a dinner spot than a brunch spot. With such star-bursting reviews, it's gotta be better than what I personally had on Saturday for brunchies.I somehow spent $30 on french toast, a brunch punch and saison beer. How. Why. I am kinda amazed. And ... I mean... it was three triangles of toast. No sides, no turkey bacon, no potatoes. Just.... bread and some whipped cheese/grape compote. I am reminded of the Amtrak commercial where the child sputters, ""Seven dollars for a PILLOW?!""Now, my wife, on the other hand, paid for what she got; oyster hash, four raw oysters and a bloody mary with a baby beer pony. I feel those dishes really brought out Dusek's flavors and what they shine at, whereas mine was something I could have concocted at home. I dunno. Whatever. Meh. Blah. And all those other internet terms for, ""It was blasé at best for me."" The interior - as has been stated - was pretty top notch, though. And I guess if I'm ever that far Southwest again (says the snobby North sider), I'll try it for dinner."
"Anticipation and hype can be a double edged sword. Often it can lead you to heightened expectations that almost can't be met and then disappointment. In this case, it led to me being even more excited and satisfied with myself on my choice to come here. My friends and I came here before going to see Owl John at the Bottom Lounge. There was a slight bit of argument, but I stood firm and kept on insisting to come here. Since I won the argument that was never really an argument, Dusek's needed to come through. And come through they did. We started off with the cured meats plate, warm brandade, and risotto. In some ways, we may have eaten our appetizers in the wrong order as we did have the cured meats before the risotto and it salted up our palates. Still, the brandade was a bit of pure happiness. It was beautifully savory and there were beef fat chips to scoop everything up. Yes, that's right, beef fat chips and they were as good as they sound. The cured meats plate was very good. I did prefer the serrano and speck more than the prosciutto, but that's really just quibbling on my part. As I noted before, eating the cured meats before the risotto may have been a slight mistake as we all wanted some more salt. But, once a quick sip from a cocktail happened, we all realized that the risotto was awesome, creamy, and exactly how we all wanted it.Dusek's blew me away. Everything was top notch and I still sit here two months later craving a return. People, get down to Pilsen and come here. You won't regret it at all!"
"Oh. My. GOD.Run, do not walk, RUN here and get the crab dip and the Juicy Lucy. I wish I had pictures to show you, but alas, I ate my food like a ravenous wolf.But believe me, this is amazing.I also had two desserts, the cookie dough and the chocolate bar. I would highly recommend anyone who dines at Dusek's to get at least one of the desserts because they are phenomenal.And if you're getting an entree that doesn't include the beef fat fries, order a side of them because they are to die for. Do it. Do it now. Go to Dusek's and give them all your money."
5 stars for all the key components Beer 5 stars. craft beer junkies get here now you don't want to miss their selection.Cocktail program 5 stars. Dusek Cooler is my all time favorite.Service 5 stars. Never ever ever been let down.Food 1000000 stars. Go Now.
"Is anyone else (even) more excited by the Dusek's menu than by Longman & Eagle's?! After scanning the menu, I jumped at the chance to try Dusek's when my parents came to town.From the amuse-bouche bisque to the entrees, I could tell the chef loves to play with sweet and sour to lip-smacking effect. Although I enjoyed my parents' dishes, especially Mom's vegetable tagine, I was even happier with my Blue Crab and Sweet Corn Risotto. Well, Blue Crab and Sweet Corn Risotto with bacon, pickled beech mushrooms, heirloom tomato concasse and pea tendrils!Apparently on the nights when a band plays upstairs in Thalia Hall, Dusek's also offers a $35 3-course prix fixe menu; choose between two fan favorite apps, entrees and desserts. With the prix fixe deal, my mom got the blue crab dip, vegetable tagine and chili churros. Ah-mazing all around!"
"I trekked it all the way to Pilsen to try this often talked about place brought to you by the people that brought you Longman & Eagle in Logan Square. Decor looks quite similar to Logman actually. I love a place that has exposed brick as part of the decor along with bookshelves on the back wall. The bar space is quite small but there is lots of standing space. Bunch of wood tables that are pushed close together which allows me to invade conversations next to me LOL.Came in for brunch this past Sunday and luckily it wasn't too crowded so we were seated instantly. I checked the menu before I got the so I already knew I was going for the oyster hash. The oyster hash is a very good dish, but you may want to order something else in addition as it is quite small or good if you have a small appetite. It includes oysters of course along with pork belly pave, charred cipollinis, soft boiled egg and delicious porter béarnaise. The dish was very good, but wished there was more. Since I could use a few extra bites of something, my lady allowed me to have some of her omelet which includes oyster mushroom, spiced goat cheese and roasted spring onion. That damn thing was really good! Since it was Sunday, I had to get the late morning/early afternoon drinks going on. I got a mimosa as well as brunch punch which has gin, sparkling wine, lime, clove and an orange slice. pretty good and refreshing...taste of gin was pretty prominent which is fine by me.We saw brunch desserts flying around so we went with it and got the cinnamon roll which is huge and may need 3 people to knock over. Unfortunately the roll was quite disappointing as it seemed dry and stale...the frosting even seemed dried up when it should have been oozing. We alerted the server and they were nice enough to take it off the bill as they told us the inconsistency of the roll doesn't normally happen. Good place here and would love to revisit. If you are driving over, parking on 18th street can be a challenge sometime especially during prime dining hours."
"Great service but disappointing brunch food. I got the oyster hash which was unique and pretty good until I took a bite of the fried oyster. It literally felt like I ate a spoonful of salt. I thought maybe it was unevenly salted so I took another bite, same thing. The potatoes that were well-seasoned but seriously a small portion. My friend got the ""steak"" and egg. The steak is a braised short rib which was dry, flavor was alright. Another friend got the Dutch baby, this was decent. But again, a very small portion. Luckily, we had split an order of beignets first. We all agreed the coffee was atrocious- it had a sour taste to it. But two stars for the good service (our waitress was very patient and our water glasses were always full) And the beignets were pretty good. However, I would not be returning for brunch."
"Really enjoyed dinner here this past Sunday.  They have a huge space and each nook/room has a bit of a different vibe, down to the playlist. Theres also a beer for everyone here (including a super fruity guava light wheat beer). The Punch House in the basement is a great alternative to a more crowded street-level bar.I liked Duseks better than its sister Longman and Eagle, space, menu, and beer-wise. We had the stuffed pretzel, Juicy Lucy, blue crab and corn risotto, prawns + one-hour (144 degree sous vide) egg + grits, chicken... I think the prawns were the best, of those.Very knowledgeable servers with spot on recommendations. They forgot my brandade fritters but were very sincere about the mistake and comped my beers for it."
"great local spot.atmosphere is very casual, and hip. Wide array of clientele, and truly represents the diversity of the city.the food is fresh, and well thought out menu.Fries are greathad risotto which was deliciouscatfish was cooked perfectlywould highly recommend."
"Came here for dinner on recommendation of two separate friends. One spoke about the great brunch.  The other about the Beef Fat Fries.  We had the fries but not brunch. I loved their (free) shrimp muse. Wife ordered the marinated sardines and potato gnocchi. The sardines were good, but the giardinera that accompanied them, even better. Gnocchi terrific.I had the Chilled Beets and Burrata. A tasty treat I'd order again. Tried the confit of octopus. Just an okay dish. The waiter closed the deal with the 'candy bar' dessert. If you love chocolate, cocoa power, slightly burnt marshmallow and a hint of raspberry, then go this route!Will definitely return. Only about 75% full on a cold Thursday night, so will probably steer clear of the crowds on a weekend here, which I suspect are crazy.  By the way, service was knowledgeable and appropriately attentive."
"// green beans - $7 - these were so good. Then weren't firm, they were stringy and covered with some fried onions.  They had a nice sauce mixed in. Get them. // mussels - $13 - these were my FAVORITE! They were covered in Harissa and the spice had such a nice kick. They also give you this Harissa butter which helps cool down your mouth.  They were some how cooked on an iron skillet. I don't know how they did it, but it was amazing. My mouth is literally watering as I type this. // boneless duck wings - $12 - these were interesting. I posted a picture of it. It's not what I expected. It looked more like egg rolls. And tastes a little bit like it. Never the less, tasty but I probably wouldn't get it again. They are only 2 that come with it. // red snapper crudo - $14 - this cold fish dish was definitely interesting. I've never had crudo before but it's like a little smashed up party of fish and other yum Yums. Small bite but very good. // juicy Lucy burger - $14 - if you have never heard of a juicy Lucy.. SHAME ON YOU! Perhaps you have never had the luxury of enjoying the cheese inside the meat of the burger. Resulting in a melty, messy, mouthgasm of love. It's the best bang for your buck. It comes with duck fat fries (heavenly) and ketchup. If you can't tell, a juicy Lucy is a burger with the cheese stuffed inside, as to get it melty, get it.// crispy pork shank - $22 - actuallyyyyy this might be my favorite. This pork shank is HUGE and sooooo tender. The meat just falls off the bone. You can share this with 3-4 people. The meat is soft and has some kind maple BBQ glaze. And afterwards take the bone to your dog. They will thank you. // duseks warmer - $8 - their apple cider drink. Heats the belly and loosens your inhibition. // chocolate bar - $8 - serves with a knife and fork. This bar is thick and firm. Delicious marshmallow fluff smeared across the plate with a caramel drizzle. To dieeee for. Sooooooo in summary. GO. And get anything. :-)"
"Brunch was bad.I still maintain my good feedback regarding dinner there but brunch just felt like a totally different restaurant, with overly (way too overly) salty and greasy food. We ordered six main dishes and couple of sides. BBQ shrimp and grits was good. Rest the pits.Good service.Normally i would have given one star but giving them benefit of doubt."
"We have been meaning to try this place for a while and last night was the time. We ordered the blue crab dip to start out and it was very good. We finished it off in no time. Next we tried the pumpkin risotto and it was excellent. Would definitely go back for this. We the tried the juicy lucy and it was as advertised. There was plenty of cheese in it as we cut it in half. The fries that came with it were also excellent, nice and crispy. For dessert we tried the cookie dough and it was also very good. The ice cream that came with it was excellent and we wish there was more. We left the restaurant stuffed and happy. They have a thorough list of drinks. I tried one of the beer flights and it was cool to try the 3 different local beers. This place is high on our list to make a return trip."
"Duseks is part of the Thalia Hall complex. Upstairs is Thalia Hall, where the shows are held. Downstairs is Punch House, the bar, think of a 70s basement where you get to drink kick ass drinks.Back to Duseks, the food here is simply amazing, the atmosphere is incredible. The prices are incredibly reasonable. Everything from a Juicy Lucy burger to a pan roasted hanger steak. Portions are more than generous, almost to much. But you are likely to try to finish it all.If you want to go a address for all your entertainment for a night this is the place. Reservations strongly recommended."
"Perfect little hipster place. Located in Pilsen right near Honky Tonk. I went here after work with two others. We were immediately seated. I opted to get a beer flight for their brewery of the month. We also got the crab dip as an appetizer. For my meal, I got the half chicken. I wasn't expecting much food given the type of restaurant, but I was pleasantly surprised with how much I got. There were two huge chicken legs. For dessert, we split the churros and the chocolate bar. I loved the churros; definitely Pilsen-quality. Overall view good spot with good food. Decent looking speakeasy in the basement as well that I'd like to check out."
"I definitely got a gold star from the Clean Plates Club after my meal here. The fish special (sturgeon... holy crap) did not disappoint! The chicken was juicy and flavorful, very well-seasoned. My date begrudgingly admitted he loved it, even though he hates going to ""trendy"" restaurants. Men, right? Delicious cocktails, great service, and really, truly excellent food. Maybe the best fish dish I've had all year. Can't wait to return. BONUS: I learned this awesome joke, which someone wrote on the chalkboard wall in the ladies' room:What is Whitney Houston's favorite coordination?HAND-EEEEEEEEEEEEEEEYYYYEEEEEEE"
"Adorable, delicious, vibey. These are the words I would use to describe Duseks. Tucked away in a little Chicago neighborhood, this place was a gem. They were able to fit in our last minute reservation for a group of 7, and the servers were kind and attentive. GREAT beer list with really reasonable prices ($5-$6). The food menu is smaller, but very focused and specialized. Lots of ""from the sea"" items, but I landed with the ham and cheese sandwich, something I NEVER order. It was awesome. Simple sandwich, with buttery toasted bread and homemade mustard. They also have a little speak-easy bar underneath, called the Punch Bowl, I believe. Very small, sort of tacky, wood paneling, mounted fish. Funny, love it."
"I had heard some great things about this place and I was more than pleased that the experience surpassed the positive reviews.My wife and I went for brunch over the weekend with a friend, made reservations easily on the restaurant's website and were sat withing minutes of arriving.  To start, the space is fantastic.  The ceiling is adorned with chandeliers utilizing Edison light bulbs which gives the space an immediate sense of history.  Books, globes, and art can be found on either the exposed brick or blue painted walls.  The main restaurant is essentially two rooms with the bar and some seating close to the entrance and the next side with even more seating.This spot scream authentically local and hip to Chicago's trends as they are already serving Chicago's own Revolution Brewery recent release, Rosa.  It must also be noted that this is the only place I've seen offer the utterly fantastic Keystone Stout, Velvet Merlin! As this was out first time, we tried a number of items, each of which was fantastic, unique and delicious!  We tasted the Churros which comes with Hot Chocolate, Blood Orange Donut to start which were great.  Following that we ate the Biscuits and Gravy which were simply amazing.  We also had the BBQ shrimp and grits where the grits were so good, my only complaint is that there weren't more.  Lastly we tried the Red Wine Poached Egg, which isn't my thing, but my wife and friend both loved it!  My daughter and son made short work of the Pear Dutch baby as well.It is also worth noting that in keeping with the authentically local theme, Dusek's serve the beyond delicious A Love Supreme Dark Matter coffee blend.  We have bags of this blend in our house as we never see it served in restaurants!Everyone we encountered at the restaurant was remarkably friendly, kind and helpful.  I can't express how refreshing it is to engage people that are friendly in the service industry as it is a rarity, unfortunately.  I'm very much looking forward to coming back for the oatmeal and trying the punch bar downstairs!"
Wow. I mean wow.  Ok give me a second. I gave the bar a  Mai Tai challenge and they killed it. My Mai Tai was built just as if Trader Vic had made it himself. The food was unbelievably wonderful. if I had the power to give out Michelin stars this chef would be driving on all four new tires. One of the best meals I've ever had in this city. Cocktail bar downstairs looks extremely interesting. If I lived in the city this would definitely become a permanent hang out for me and my wallet.
"breakfastrules.blogspot.…I was a little worried when I looked up Dusek's website and found that they took reservations that it would have been too packed for us to get served. But when we got there I was worried because no one else was there. Something didn't add up.After the breakfast, more people did show up for some morning grub. However, I kept thinking ""Why isn't this place packed with a line stretching out the door?""Dusek's Board & Beer is doing breakfast brilliantly, folks. The prices are bit on the higher-side and the portions are a bit modest for our crew, but that's OK when everything is delicious, savory, well-paired and filling. As Dr. Nick said, ""I don't mind paying a bit more for breakfast as long as it's good."""
"I went here for brunch with several friends a few weeks ago.It's not very easy to get to, no trains go anywhere near here so I would suggest driving or taking a cab unless you are close. Atmosphere here is pretty good although it's a leans towards the basic hipster white guy with an unkept beard kind of crowd. I would also like if they got rid of the Edison style light bulbs.I got french toast, it was pretty good. Everyone else was really happy with their food too.Prices are a little high, especially for being in this out of the way neighborhood.Bathrooms are down a loooong flight of stairs and are dark and gross."
"Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.  So why did I try Duseks again?? We just went back today for brunch.Strike 1 - out of bloody marys at noon. on a sunday.  um whaaaatWaiter recommends the oyster hash and grits, so thats what we order.Strike 2 - food comes out, barely warm.  clearly had been sitting there forever.Strike 3 - these are the smallest portions... like ever.  I actually asked the waiter before ordering if they were full portions or share size, and he told us full portions. there was maybe five spoonfuls of grits. Oh wait, except I never got a spoon from anyone, so I had to try and scoop it with my fork.  the oyster hash had ONE oyster.  I double-checked the menu, yes it says oysters on the menu, nope, just one lonely oyster.  Dropped $40 bucks and still super hungry.  The most absurd experience ever. Never again.  Do not give in to the little voices on yelp telling you this place is good."
"Their Oyster Hash may just be one of the best things I've had in my mouth so far in 2014, and I made out with Kate Upton on St. Patrick's Day. Just kidding... I definitely didn't make out with her, but that should tell you how damn delicious this dish is. Their brunch is ballin...Straight up ballin...Awesome bloodys and everything on the food menu is just about as gorgeous to look at as it is amazing to eat. Seriously...if you're the type to take pictures of your food it's like the savory version of the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue. You almost feel bad sinking your teeth into your meal until your taste buds tell you it's A-OK. Service was great as well and it's really priced pretty well considering how quality the food is. Can't say enough about Dusek's, but do yourself a favor and get in for their brunch. It's 100 percent worth the trip to Pilsen."
Fine brunch spot if you can get in early. Not worth the wait otherwise. Fried oyster hash was overrated and not that good. Breakfast sandwich was surprisingly good.
"My favorite new restaurant! Everything from the food, service, and look of Duseks was great, in addition to the Punch House, and Thalia Hall. You get everything you want in one big package. Our waiter was so knowledgeable and honest. We couldn't get past the share plates/apps, because they looked and tasted so good. Next time we have to get the pork shank, or whatever entree stands out. Let's  just say everything looks great, everything we got was fantastic....looking fwd to our next visit..."
"I came to Dusek's a few weeks ago with friends for dinner.Or at least I think I did. I'm not entirely sure. It was really dark and I couldn't really see much of what was going on. But whatever did happen was good. Really REALLY good. Super good, in fact. Maybe even excellent.But there were definitely a few exceptions to their excellence.Nothing big. Not a huge deal, but there's room for improvement, which it expected from a new biz.***So, I'd called early on the day myself, my cellmate, and our two friends were to eat here to make a reservation, only they only take reservations for parties of 5 or more, but the guy on the phone said not to worry about it, it's a huge place and we should have no problem getting right in as 4 people at 7:30 on a Friday night. To me, that seemed like kind of a crazy thing to say with them being the hottest new biz on the block Pilsen on a Friday night, but whatever. HE assured me that we'd get a seat right away. We arrive just before 7:30 and the place looks full-ish, but by no means packed, we'd be the first group of people there who weren't already sat. We check in with the hostess and she tells us it's around a 35-40 minute wait, but it shouldn't take that long -- which kind of makes no sense, but at the same time I completely understood from my days as a hostess and having to give a 'safety wait-time' that's longer than the group's actual projected wait-time so they don't get impatient or have to wait longer and get pissed. Admittedly, at first I was kind of peeved given what I was told on the phone about being able to get right in, but then I called my tits and realized that waiting a half hour was fine, plus we could try to grab a seat at the bar. An hour and 15 minutes later is when we actually got sat and when we were sat, about half the tables in the second room were empty. We guessed that maybe because they had just opened that they were trying to space out the tables for servers, but still -- we were the first people to be added to the wait-list and we were told a significantly shorter wait-time as our maximum wait-time, so you'd think they would've put a little more of an action item on getting us sat. A few minutes after we approached the full bar 3 seats opened up right in front of us, so we sat down... but were promptly asked to move from the 3rd seat as the person sitting there was coming back... okay, fine. Weird that she didn't leave any of her sh*t to claim that spot, but whatever. The lady, who was an off-duty employee of the business, comes back about 10 minutes later, sits down, and we hear the bartender tell her that when the bar is full of customer's the manager doesn't want employees taking up seats at the bar. The off-duty employee said she understood, but then continued to sit and nurse a near-empty beer while half our group stood off to the side. Sooo, I don't know what was up with that but that never would have flown at any bar or restaurant I've ever worked at.When we were sat, it was by a super friendly guy with a b*tchin' mustache who made up for the extra long wait and poor form by an employee at the bar in his charming smile. Perhaps he was the manager because he was floating throughout the venue all night and helping out where needed, but either way, job well done. We were sat at a free-standing table in a larger annexed room. It's super dark. Like, batcave dark. I felt like a grandma pulling out my phone to read the menu or try to see what my food looked like, but otherwise it did make for great atmosphere. Plus, I realized later in the evening that my sh*tty eyeliner was basically pooling under my eyes because I don't know how to put makeup on properly, so in the end it admittedly saved me some face.Our server was a rockstar. No, really. I think he might be in a band or something. He had that look. It's a good thing because he was sweet and knew his sh*t. I liked that he'd give real feedback on the menu and not just bullsh*t you. When I was between two things he let me know that one was kind of on the small side, and that if I'd had the Acadia lobster roll, this one might not be able to compare, but since I'm not cool and I've never had the fortune of dining on Acadia's LR, I ordered Dusek's version here. Verdict: Pretty good, generous portion, though much of is a supremely thick toast that wasn't my cup of tea, and I kind of felt like it took away from the lobster. The real star here, and what was the main suggestion of our server: The Moroccan Spiced Vegetable Tagine. Get that. Even if you eat meat, GET THAT. No joke. All four of us at the table had major regrets once we tapped that tagine. GET.THAT. For four people, we ordered two appetizer salads, and four entrees, and to be honest, I could've eaten a little more... but we saved that thought and head down to Punch House (in basement here) for the pretzel ice cream truffle chocolate magic thing and I'd highly recommend you do that as well."
"Mocktail Report: Rumor has it that the chef at Dusek's doesn't drink and wanted to provide a nonalcoholic option so they developed their ""craft pop"". House made sodas that are carbonated to order. It is pretty cool to watch them make the sodas using a special bottle and carbonation (gas?). When I was there last year you needed to be in Dusek's not Punch House to order them, I am not sure if this has changed but it is worth checking out!"
"Service was wack. If you're in a hurry or on the go don't bother coming here. The original ""Korean chicken with waffles"" was a also overly sauced and not Korean tasting at all, So fail there. I was just trying this place out for brunch what a mistake. Not coming back what are we living in the Stone Age where molasses is the environment?"
"Went on a Friday night.  Tried two glasses of punch bowl downstairs-- both were very good though a tad pricey.  Tab was $21 including tip.After a 35 minute wait we were seated and we quickly got our drink order in within the first five minutes.  Their draft beer selection is phenomenal and they have an in-house fruity IPA that is very good.  After a while we had a chance to actually order; the waiter was very patient describing the special of the day (""The Regular"").  We had crab dip as an app, which comes with not quite enough bread.  The dip itself was delicious.I had the ""Regular"", which was described as a pork shank but came out as a beef shank.  ""Beef?"" I asked the server who brought the food; ""Yes, Beef"" he said.  Okay then.  Strangely enough, we heard our waiter again describe the special as a ""Pork"" shank.  Fortunately I like meat, so I was still happy with my food... but that was weird, especially given how self-satisfied the waiter was with his performance in explaining the special.My wife had the burger which wasn't anything too special but tasty enough nonetheless. I'd avoid the sauce though.. didn't seem to jive.  Their fries are VERY good.I am probably not going to come back, though, because of how weird and how slow the service was.  There's a tangible difference between having time enough to not feel rushed and then to have to spend 15 minutes searching the room for your waiter to reappear so you can pay your damn bill.  What's even more annoying is that he took my card with the check and then, instead of taking 20 seconds to run it, immediately went to go take the order of the table next to us, who ended up being indecisive and needing a lot of coaxing from the waiter.   Way to goof up your tip, guy.The host seemed especially confused most of the time and I casually noticed how long it took them to turn over a table.  The table itself was clean and ready for people to be seated but for some reason another 10 minutes would go by before they actually sat someone down.  Sure, it's ""chic-hipster"" but get your head out of your asses; this is basic stuff.Either hire more people or change your laid back attitude... you're looking at an easy $100 night for a drink before and dinner and drink(no s) for two."
"I am never ever ever in the Pilsen area, and clearly no one else is either, because to my surprise there was no wait on a Saturday night. I imagine if Dusek's had opened in a different neighborhood, people would have been swarming. Like sister restaurant Longman & Eagle, it's one of those places you'd go if you're a ""Dream of the 1890s"" type of guy. And if you understood that, you most definitely should be here. The space is much larger than L&E's and would actually be good for groups. Service was very attentive and food was served quickly, which is always impressive for a place that just opened.  We ordered:- Oysters- Crispy Pig Tail- Southern Green Beans- Cobia Collar- Lobster Roll- Chocolate Bar- Fall TrifleOverall the food was good. I think some of the seasoning choices were inconsistent. For example, the Crispy Pig Tail was quite salty. The Green Beans were waaaay over buttered. And the Cobia collar was spicy, but not salty enough. On the plus side, the lobster in the Lobster Roll was cooked perfectly so that it wasn't overcooked and rubbery, and the roll, mmm that buttery, toasted roll.On the dessert side, the Chocolate Bar is very good and has some fun accompaniments like coca-cola cream and roasted grapes and you will probably like it if you are a chocolate fanatic, otherwise this dessert may be too rich for you. The Fall Trifle is a great option if you're looking for something that's not overly sweet. It's a fancy layered jello w/ elderflower flavors, which I love.They have a great beer and cocktail list (yay, $8 cocktails!), and just downstairs is Punch House, a bar with a mesmerizing aquarium.Chalkboard walls inside and outside the bathrooms add a fun novelty, and probably saw an increase of raunchy drawings as the night continued and the liquor was poured. And hopefully by the time you've read this, they will have fixed the 2 of 3 broken stalls in the ladies' room.  Also broken, the light timer in the ladies' room. Added to my ""Ways I Wouldn't Want to Die "" list: When I'm locked in a bathroom stall and suddenly the bathroom goes pitch black.Overall I enjoyed myself, and I would come back to try that Juicy Lucy on the menu and also try the cocktails downstairs at Punch House. But I will be avoiding the bathroom. (If this was your idea of discouraging diners to use the bathroom so you won't have to clean it, well-played person in-charge of bathroom cleaning, well-played)."
"From the first time it opened it's doors until now, I have loved everything about Dusek's!  The food, the atmosphere, the people.  Keep going strong.  Oh, can't forget the great beer list. :)and the Mussels are one of my all time faves."
"Those mussels were so delicious! Cannot get over how well steamed and flavorful the seasoning was on the shells. Served with melted butter, I couldn't stop eating it. Paired it with a cold mimosa and I was one happy girl! Only wish it came with some toasted bread to help mop up some of the sauce. Ended up ordering a side of toast to eat with the dish. Great new hidden place in Pilsen!"
"Tips:1. Put your name on the list BEFORE looking for parking!! They will text you when your table is ready.2. It's worth the wait.Best.Mussels.Ever. It's been over a week and I'm still salivating over them. Seriously, they were divine! They were roasted and served in an iron skillet. I'm used to seeing mussels in a broth, so I was surprised to not see much of any. Upon further review I noticed a bit of thick, redness at the bottom of the skillet.... Aha... the paprika. I don't think I talked the entire time there were still mussels at the table. Secretly, I think it was a race between me and my date to see who could eat the most! Next was the wood roasted crab dip. It came with warm, melt in your mouth bread... not your typical rock hard baguette. The dip was perfectly creamy and full of yummy crab meat. We ventured out a bit with our last order and got the duck meatloaf. Kieran, our server, was very honest about this dish... he said it was ""fun"". Define ""fun"". It obviously wasn't going to be like traditional meatloaf... it was topped with a sunny side up duck egg and a ketchup glaze that he literally described as a fruit roll up! Sounds gross right? I cannot disagree but we were intrigued so went ahead and ordered it. Welp... the ketchup glaze was indeed like a fruit roll up and it was WEIRD. It had the same texture as a fruit roll up, hard and difficult to tear apart. Not quite the type of topping I want on my meatloaf. The actual duck meatloaf was good though, as was the duck egg. The green beans had somewhat of a sweetness to them, as did the cipollini onions. Note to self: I do not like cipollini onions.It was an interesting way to end the wonderful meal. Although we weren't huge fans of the last dish, we still cleaned our plate (sans the fruit roll up) and felt good about it all. WHEN I go back I will definitely be ordering the mussels (perhaps a whole order to myself) and crab dip again. They have an extensive draft beer to try too. This time I only had the Uncle John's Cider which was good.The service was on point... I appreciate places that leave nice pitchers on water at the table, the bowl of mussel shells were emptied often, Kieran was overall an excellent server, and the two hostesses at the front were super sweet. My first thought when we arrived was ""damn, it's packed (it was around 9:30pm on a Saturday) and I'm hungry."" As soon as they took our phone number and said they would text us when our table was ready I felt better. We still had to wait the requisite 45 minutes, but it was definitely worth the wait and I'm a HUGE FAN of Dusek's now! I can't wait to try their brunch! Mmmmmmm."
"Ahh..summer and a Monday nite on the patio.  OH NO---it's dollar oysters, tecate and roasted olives.  One couldn't ask for more.  The oysters although small were sweet and really did not need dressing.  The olives were succulent. Catherine really knew the menu as I overheard her explaining to the tables on either side of me.  All good in Pilsen."
"Wow!  5 stars?  You betcha!  Cuz in my book it all comes down to great service, outstanding food and an atmosphere that makes me talk about it, and Dusek's has all three!We went on a weekday night, reservations made (parties of 5 or more only), and since I got there early I took a seat at the bar.  Now here is the part that always makes me smile.  While I had recognized the manager, Will, from his previous post at Longman and Eagle, I had no sooner sat at the bar and the bartender said he knew me.  I marvel at this skill as I know bartenders see hundreds of people a week so when Carlos said he knew me I was pretty impressed.  And I was even more impressed when it turned out he remembered me from the restaurant he used to work at and that my last visit there was at least a couple of years ago!  Wow!  Dusek's specializes in beer so there are plenty of choices on tap, but this martini loving girl stuck with what she likes the best.  Other than the non martini type glass that it came in- it was quite good!Dusek's is named after the person who built Thalia Hall (of which it is located in) back in 1892.  It is the restaurant on the main floor of the building but know that there is the Punch House bar in the basement (another review) and the actual hall that is being restored upstairs (stunningly beautiful),  A special thanks to Will for taking the time to give us a tour of the place as it is really an amazing piece of Chicago history!We were shown to our table in the dining area and proceeded to look over the menu.  Jack, our server, did a good job in steering us toward some of his favorites and letting us know that we were ordering too much food (he was spot on)We started with the fresh oysters, the mussels, the cheese stuffed pretzel (oddly delicious) and the venison tartar.  While all were good- that venison tartar was amazing.  So much so that we ended up ordering a second order of it.  The mussles were also unusual as the spice was on the outside of the shells so while it might be bad table manners, we were pulling the mussels from the shells and then rubbing them on the shell to capture that.  Our only wish would be that there had been bread to sop up all the delicious juices in the bottom of the mussels.  So we ordered some additional bread for the table.Next up?  Entrees.  We had the pork shank (amazing!) the short rib (tasty) the juicy lucy burger (obviously good as it didn't get shared) and duck fat fries .  That pork shank rocked our night.  If you go- it has to be a must have on your list to try.And if that wasn't enough- we had the chocolate bar and churros for dessert.  The chocolate bar is DEFINITELY calorie worthy . . .I think two of us gobbled up the entire thing.Dinner with plenty of drinks for 5 ran about $300 so the prices for all of this wonderful food and drink is also reasonable.  As for parking- on the night we were there- there was plenty right out in front on 18th Street.Loved the food, the service and you know I love anything that has a history like this place does.  I'll be back cuz there is plenty more I need to try on this amazing menu, including brunch!"
"Here's my beef. If you aren't going to accept reservations on nights when there's a concert at your sister venue, then just forget it. We showed up at 6pm (show to begin at 8), it wasn't crowded but were told two hours for a table. Do we need to show up at 5? Come on. Went downstairs for some mediocre food at the super hip Punch House only because we had no other choice."
Short ribs were tough and dry. Dessert was dry tooMany other places we'd try first instead of going back here.
"The crab dip is delicious. And their beer selection is really really great. Their menu is not very extensive, or even varied, so if you are or are with a picky eater sometimes it can be tough. I had the shrimp and grits, which was okay. Nothing else on the menu jumped out at me. It's hard to explain, but after about half of it,  I was tired of it. And this isn't very ""foodie"" of me, but I wasn't a fan of the shrimp still having their heads on. My husband had the juicy lucy, which he said was good but nothing great, but he is from Minneapolis where juicy lucys were invented, so he's hard to please on that! The service was just okay, a little slow, and our server kept forgetting our drinks and we would have to remind her. But it's a cool location and if you want to try new beers, they have the best selection."
Love this restaraunt! Been here twice and never had a bad plate! I hear a very very well respected michelin chef opened this restaraunt in pilsen as a very doable price yet top of the line food. The oysters are wonderful too. High quality food at a good price! Cant ask for anything else
"This restaurant makes me think I was too hasty in giving out five stars to other restaurants. This meal was perfection.First, drinks. I've had more gin and tonics than anyone under 30 should have had but their gin and tonic was the best I've ever had. The fall Collins was also amazing but I recommend the gin and tonic.Service was impeccable. Truly flawless and detail-oriented. It is important to note however, that I went on a Tuesday night when they weren't too busy.The half chicken was otherworldly.  The scallop small plate was ""the best scallop dish I've ever had,"" according to my boyfriend. It's not like he's had limitless scallops in his life, but still, damn good.Ambiance was hip; music, great. Heard a Wanda Jackson song I hadn't heard in a while."
"Gosh. Dusek's is hard one to review. On the one hand, I thought this was a fantastic spot to socialize with good friends and looked like a wonderful local gathering place. Service was solid. Moreover, their desserts were incredible and unique. I couldn't have asked for a better environment to celebrate life! On the other hand, their actual entrees were hit or miss... and I couldn't get over some of the mediocrity. This spot really deserves 3.5 stars, but I enjoyed my night so much it gets a lil' boost.Dusek's is located on a corner in the heart of Pilsen. Even outside the restaurant, you can already tell it's bustling inside. I recently dropped by with five friends for Saturday dinner. The hostesses were friendly and patient (a couple of our friends were running a bit behind schedule and they were understanding). When our party was all there, we were sat in this lovely booth with two chairs. The comfortable booth seating and rich interiors made for a pleasant dining experience. (Think about dark wood, rich hues of brown and blue, marble, brass, exposed brick.) It was a bit too dimly lit for my tastes, but I suppose that was intentional since Dusek's gives off this ""old school Chicago"" feel that I absolutely adore. The music? Loved it. Some classic rock to folk to a little bit of soft rock... Dusek's was spinning my jams! Our fellow diners? In short: hipsters, yuppies, and gay hipsters and gay yuppies. Naturally. For some of the single ladies at our table, a few of us helped them locate some potential straight men in case they felt like getting a couple phone numbers in between main course and *ahem* dessert. (I understand this sounds completely suggestive.) Funny enough, when I was dressing up for the evening, I thought about wearing a vintage vest with a button-up, khakis, and oxfords. Apparently, I wasn't the only one who thought that since that was pretty much the standard male ensemble for the evening. I'm glad I *didn't* go with that outfit choice after all.Anyway, our server came by (wearing this cool faded pastel floral shirt), welcomed us, described the menu, and pointed out the beverages. Everyone seemed pleased with their cocktails. I also noticed they had this flavored craft soda that sounded amazing: fig honeycomb. UMM... yes, it was indeed AMAZING. I highly recommend it. For appetizers, we split the stuffed pretzel with beer mustard ($6). Excellent. Beautiful crust, soft interior, and fantastic flavors going on with that mustard. The duck fat fries and romesco ($6) were also crowd pleasers. I personally don't *love* romesco, but it was nice. (It's a texture thing for me.) In terms of entrees, my friends and I ordered our own plates, but we all took a bite of each other's food because they all sounded so enticing. I had the 18 hour coffee rubbed short rib ($26). This was accompanied with celery root puree, child-salt roasted thumbelina, smoked king trumpet, charred frisee, and cocoa nib bordelaise. This was elegantly presented and I loved the subtle adornment of nibs. Overall, the dish was good, but I expected more pizzaz based on the sounds of its preparation. The coffee flavor was subtle, but I was hoping for other flavors that would enhance those notes and hints of coffee. My friends ordered (and these are loosely based on their testimonies): The mussels ($13) didn't feel like mussels because there wasn't a beautiful sauce to sop up the natural juices of the seafood. It also didn't come with crostini or baguette... or some kind of carb to aid each bite of mussel. The seared day boat scallops ($18) were beautifully cooked. The truffle gnocchi was a nice addition to the firm, creamy scallop. The BBQ fresh gulf prawns ($15) were fantastic. The grits were tasty and had a perfect consistency. The prawns were fresh and nicely prepared.Desserts (each $8): These were the clear winners of the night. We all ordered different things, but tasted each. The malted English pudding was fabulous -- especially the black walnut cream. The roasted chili churros were also brilliant. That hit of heat at the end was a nice touch for a dessert/snack that is usually very sugary. The Black & Tan was beautifully presented with the voluptuous soda overflowing from the rim of the glass. The house-made chocolate shortbread was tasty as well. My dessert was the chestnut genoise (coffee granita, espresso anglaise, confit chestnuts, coffee jell-o [how unexpected, right?!] [or if you wanna be ""fancy,"" call it a gelee], chestnut-maple sherbet, and if that wasn't enough... caramelized souffléd rice!) This was absolutely memorable and my friends agreed this was probably one of their favorites. There were so many components to the chestnut genoise, but it all worked together. Dusek's desserts were so dynamic and satisfying. I'd come back just for their sweets. In the end, Dusek's had more plusses than minuses. It's a lively spot perfect for communing with good friends. Give it a try."
"Atmosphere was unique, drinks were fresh and fun and the food, AMAZING! We ordered the Dutch baby, scotch egg and steak and eggs. Everything was superb."
"This is an impressive addition to the neighborhood. Everything is excellent but does not have a price tag to match. Service is highly attentive.Arrive at any time and bide your time at the more contemporary bar in Dusek's or visit the more traditional bar downstairs.I tried ""The Ordinary"" and was very impressed. A lobster pot pie brought their skill with seafood and an American fall tradition together with incredible results. My wife had the skirt steak and it was also done properly (although it is not necessarily adventurous). We shared the chocolate bar which was incredibly rich and I would not have been able to live with myself if I had wasted even a bite.Dusek's should be on everybody's new ""must eat"" Chicago list."
"What a great spot! We celebrated my moms birthday here a couple weeks ago and our experience was perfect. From the cocktails to the service, we were happy with it all. Johnathan, our server, was very knowledgeable and fun. Highly recommended!!"
"Went to Dusek's for the first time with a friend on Wednesday night. Love the ambience with a hip, classy, modern vibe. The greeter up front was lovely and we were seated quickly. A few minutes went by before our server came over, it didn't seem like it was too long, but when she did, she was very apologetic that she didn't reach us sooner. As she shared the menus she was informative, genuine and authentic. The food was delicious - I ordered the Pork Belly (reasonably priced considering the upscale environment) with a side of broccolini (this I do feel was over priced, but I love broccolini so there is no price too high). My friend ordered the chicken also fantastic. And then a FIRST EVER in a resturant !!Mid meal the Manager came over to introduce himself and also acknowledge that our server took a little longer to reach us upon being seated. Let me preface that I have eaten at many high end restaurants and been treated like crap and never before has anyone taken initiative like the server and Manager did (and really, it wasn't that big a deal, sure we were seated for a little longer than ideal before we were approached by our server but no one died) . This was a FIRST! As a human being there is nothing quite like being acknowledged and seen, heard and felt. I truly admire when people in general take responsibility for where they have fallen short (of their own professional standards) and the acknowledgement is worth its weight in gold. In addition we were offered dessert on the house. Which was INSANE (we had Churros and Cookie Dough) I am from the west coast and travel to Chicago every couple of months for work - based on the above stellar experience I will make it a point to revisit each time I am back in Chicago."
Went here for lunch a couple weeks back! Amazing can't wait to go back!!! The Beef fat French fries are addictive.  The fried oyster poo boy is ridiculously great!!! A must try.  Jared is a creative genius!!!!
It's delicious I love the pumpkin risotto... The  ambience is great and the staff is attentive and nice..
Went early on a Saturday night. We noticed how friendly and attentive all the staff was- so different from Longman and Eagle where the staff would rather die from their hipsterness than be nice to you.Great beer selection- even the food runner was suggesting beer pairings for us! We had a couple of Juicy Lucy's and a Lobster Roll. All super good with an inordinate amount of fries- not quite understanding the complaints about small portions posted here.Will definitely be back!
"#icant. But let me at least try to describe how great my experience at Dusek' was: First off, I was a little nervous about the no reservation thing, because I get very anxious about long waits. My boyfriend and I arrived in the Pilsen area around 6:30pm. Parking was a breeze. It was also free (considering it was Sunday, thank you Jesus). We were feeling pretty good at this point. We walked in. The restaurant wasn't bursting at the seams with people. The hostess told us it would be about a 10-15 minute wait. She was accurate. We used the 15 minutes to go downstairs and grab a drink at Punchhouse. We were both floored by the vibe and decor. Chatted for 10 minutes about how awesome this place was and how we made a great decision. Five minutes later, I got a text saying our table was ready. We were pleased. After being seated, we perused through the menu. And holy shit. We wanted everything. and the draft list was unbelievable. and each beer was only $4-6! CAN YOU FEEL THE MOMENTUM BUILDING? We ordered the beef fat fries and blue crab dip to start. I consider myself a french fry connoisseur and the beef fat fries were exquisite. If you like heavily salted fries, this will be your jam. The blue crab dip came with freshly baked bread. Carbs are also my specialty. And the bread was fantastic. The crab dip tasted so fresh, I felt like I was taking bites of the ocean. For our entree we ordered the Porchetta and Choucrute (don't judge me, it was my birthday dinner). The porchetta came out first. My boyfriend does this thing when he tastes something REALLY good: he closes his eyes, bobs his head, and slowly waves the utensils in his hands in a small circular motion. He did that after his first bite of the Porchetta. By the time the Choucrute came out, we were SO full that we couldn't even finish it. But needless to say, it warranted the same exact reaction as the Porchetta. I have never seen/eaten a crispier skinned duck confit. I love dessert, but at this point, we felt like we were going to explode so we passed on the sweets. It is a decision that was not made lightly, but it needed to be done because their portions were so satisfying. Service was also top notch. Just everything. Top notch. I didn't forget about you, dessert, I'll be coming back! See you soon, Dusek's, I love you."
"Really enjoyed this place and worth the trip down from Lake View.  We came here to try a bunch of stuff and we hit a bug chunk of the menu.  Menu is big so without more than 4 people we will need to return.  Some of the items were excellent, some I would suggest you skip.  Here's my breakdown:Duck fat fries....  Get them, tasty, cooked perfectly, side sauce was greatCaliflower Gratin.... Get them, i'm not even a big fan of Cali but this was a cheesy treatCountry Ham Samp.... Must order, excellent cured meat, 3 meats to try, incredibly large portions.... and crazy brioche or something like it toast... this was the signature dish out of our orderSweetbreads.... I'm a big fan of sweatbreads... think Publican does them right as an example.  These just did not blow it out like the food listed so far.  I'd say skip but these were not terrible just not to the same level as the other dishes.  If you haven't had sweetbreads before these are a pretty safe start to them.Brandade Fritter... solid example of fritters, like the sauce order themLobster Pot Pie... excellent crust, great flavor, wish there was more lobster but overall a nice plate for a cold nightConfit Octopus.... solid choice, cheek was excellent, octopus was prepared nicelyBlack and White Risotto.... this was the one weak spot for the evening.  I would not recommend this.  Maybe an off night or something but not a good dish, runny, lacking flavor, just didn't look good.  Every place has it's signature dishes, great dishes and average dishes.  This one just doesn't seem to fit with the quality and execution of all the others.  Cocktails were executed well and were creativeOutstanding beer list both on tap and bottled.  I'd say one of the top in the city and one of the best in the South side.  Setup great for larger parties from the look of it.  Great ambiance and layout.  Very friendly staff... bit on the hipster side but hey our guy knew his beer and was fun to talk to ;)"
Great food. Cool environment. Everything is beer themed which is cool. Everything we got was delicious. Served pretty quick and there was no wait for Saturday brunch. In not a great neighborhood but it doesn't seem sketchy.
"Living in wicker park, we aren't on the streets of Pilsen too often. But the praise duseks has received got our attention enough to give brunch a try. Waited about 10 minutes (no worries tho, brunch is brunch). Very cool vibe, diverse crowd, although the lack of diversity among the shirt choices of the servers (literally all of them were in flannel it was like a hipster Applebee's) was distracting. The food however was pretty good. Ordered the chorizo breakfast Sammie, hamhock on toast and beignets. The beignets were the highlight for sure, warm and crispy but also melt in your mouth. Bloody Mary was also on point - good spice and garnish. Worth the ride down south for sure, and overall was a nice little brunch in another chi neighborhood."
"If you've never been to Pilsen before and want a reason to venture over there, this is a good place to start (after you've had a few downstairs at Punch House of course).A friend of mine worked on their signage and menus so some friends and I went opening night for a few drinks. So, although I might be a bit biased, I have to admit when I walked in I already had a good vibe. The space itself is huge and well laid out in a way that it still feels cozy. There are a couple rooms with lots of different seating and high tops on one side so it's really great for anything casual all the way up to a nice dinner with friends or your S/O.I've since gone back a few times to sample some of the food and let me tell you, it's the bomb. It changes up quite a bit but everything I've had here so far was delicious, the chicken (yes, it's just chicken) was probably my favorite. I didn't know it could be so tender and dare I say... moist (ew). There wasn't really anything that I've had that was just ""meh"".All in all, do yourself a favor and check this place out!"
"Solid experience at Dusek's, sister restaurant to Michelin starred venue Longman & Eagle. Dusek's features quality adult beverages and sophisticated, elevated bar fare (a true Gastropub). I arrived early and sat at the bar while awaiting my party's arrival. The space is chic and attractive and I was impressed with the beer list; approximately two dozen craft beers on tap with a great menu offering helpful information about them in a concise manner. The bartender was friendly and everything was off to a great start. There was also a hot punch available at the bar and high end liquors available for cocktails (Dusek's also has a cocktail lounge, Punch House, downstairs). I was dining with a large party which can pose a challenge to the restaurant; further compounding the matter we did not have an exact head count. While the near -40 wind chill that evening (thanks to the Polar Vortex) did make things easier in that it kept capacity down, the restaurant nevertheless did a masterful job accommodating us all and providing personable and efficient service to such a large group. Food managed to come out all at once without any apparent drop in quality or lengthy delay; kudos to the staff and the chef! I ordered the Juicy Lucy; a Slagel Farms sourced thick beef patty with cheese inside the burger, served with a delicious bacon/onion marmalade and a generous portion of duck fat fries. The burger was cooked a perfect medium rare and was absolutely delicious; the only minor disappointment was the menu description stated housemade pretzel roll (which I love) but what was served did not appear to be a pretzel roll. Nevertheless I really enjoyed my burger and at $14 (including the fries) felt it was a very reasonable value for the high quality and robust quantity. Between the great beers, tasty burger, nice space and friendly and efficient service it definitely left me wanting to return to partake in some more of their menu items (much of which looked intriguing). Pilsen is really becoming a player in Chicago's dining bustling dining scene."
"Beermosas!  Yes, a beer mimosa hybrid! Dusek's is such a great place for brunch you can pair your breakfast with an alcoholic beverage and not feel like an alchy. But that's not the only reason why this Pilsen gem deserves a 4 star. The food is so decadent, unique, and delicious. The prices are just on point. And the ambience is energetic, fun , and laid back. I really recommend you to check it out."
"We heard about this place and to be honest went for the Monday evening happy hour for $1 dollar oysters. The special oysters were a bit on the small side, but ok, not the end of the world. We sampled a few beers off the decent list of draughts (which change regularly) and settled down for a leisurely pick and mix form the menu. The sweetbreads were a very tasty dish as was the Gnocchi. The place was very nicely laid out and with a good atmosphere. The  HR downstairs and Thalia Hall upstairs probably ensue the place is heaving at the weekends. In short, really nice place with very tasty food. Visit, you won't be disappointed."
"Probably ordered way too much food, but how could I not? Everything sounded so good! From start to finish the meal was perfect. The downstairs was a bit busy so I didn't stay for a drink so I guess I'll just have to come back. Oh darn. ;)"
mmmmmmm so yummy.
"I've gone to Dusek's a couple of times now and sometimes it's a hit and other times it's a miss. Sadly,this last occasion was a definite miss. The flavor mash-ups of everything  and even things I've previously tried were a bit off and a bit too salty. With the long wait times and fancy price point this lack of consistency is disappointing; hence the 3 star rating. I definitely wouldn't steer people away from Dusek's since it can be and has been in the past a total hit! However they don't have much leeway left with me."
My boyfriend and I came in on a Friday night without a reservation.  They were able to accommodate us and let us know that we'd have a time limit at the table for another party coming in after us.  I appreciated that honesty and never felt rushed during our meal.  The cocktails are delicious and we had a fantastic meal.  Everything we ordered was great.  Our waitress was extremely knowledgable and coursed our meal with perfect timing.  I cannot wait to come back again!
"I really enjoyed my experience here despite difficulty choosing from the menu (its a complicated menu!) The waitress was EXTREMELY attentive.  Food was good but not GREAT. Would go back for the overall experience again. Great for dates, parents night out, etc."
"Had a dinner for 12 amidst a late Feb snowstorm - what a fantastic time.  Wonderful food, inventive and delicious. Our server was knowledgable, enthusiastic and proud of her kitchen.  I am very particular and Duseks overachieved..several of us arrived early and the bar staff recommended several snacks and then pushed on our beer choice. They gave me several trial sized until I made a pick. And it is an easy, casual restaurant.  A new Chicago favorite.  Could easily be a 5."
"I've found my new favorite restaurant in Chicago (besides this, it's Blackbird!),Came with my friends on a Sunday night for my birthday and all the food blew us away! Between the five of us, we ordered the roasted duck meatloaf (the table's favorite, it turned out), kentucky fried quail (the cornbread that came with it was so good!), venison tartare, juicy lucy (burger stuffed with cheese), tea smoked duck breast (also very good), blue crab dip (another thumbs up), and I ordered the 'Mariachi el Bronx' : house sangrita, shot of tequila, tiny michelada. It all came in separate glasses, so you could control the taste of the cocktail on your by mixing as you like.We all topped off the night with the malted english pudding (yum!), ginger cazuela cake (warm and delicious, topped with ice cream), black and tan (I could have drank it all by myself, but unfortunately had to share!), AND cookie dough (loved the presentation-- fernet chocolate chips, egg custard ice cream, chocolate cremeu, mint, cookie powder).My favorites were the cookie dough, tea smoked duck breast, roasted duck meatloaf and the ginger cazuela cake. I love the innovative dishes, great presentation, and the laid-back, rustic feel of the restaurant. It felt like I was back in Portland, and the prices were reasonable!Also, you can venture downstairs to Punch House afterwards for drinks!"
Came with the bf and got Juicy Lucy's and the crab dip.  Burger was amazing and the best burger I've ever had and came with delicious fries (also probably the best fries I've had).  Huge portions had me stuffed and I went to a beer fest after which I would not recommend.
"Great cocktails, good ambiance, good place to take your dates to. The good is really good,  I recommend the squid, tasty stuff and the gnocchi is good."
"There's nothing that blew me away about Dusek's. The atmosphere was warm, old school, and inviting. I enjoyed the atmosphere and the dim lighting. As for the food- I had the  Juicy Lucy Burger, the jar of pickles, and the stuffed pretzel. The pickles were okay. Really all it was, was dill pickles with other pickled vegetables and bread. Nothing that was to write home about. The pretzel was average. I really don't think you can screw it up. The burger was actually really good but also very rich in flavor. The fries that come with the burger are addicting because they're beef fat fries!However, I think this place isn't that memorable. I believe it's over priced for what you get. There's just nothing that really stuck out to me for how much hype there was about this place."
"A group of about 7 of us went on a random Friday and shared many many plates.  I don't recall what all we got but know that we all were very very pleased.  I can't wait to go again and if you haven't been there yet, get on it!"
"My first Yelp review!  Loved Dusek's!  Dim lighting and energetic music made for the perfect ambiance with my girlfriends. The only reason I can't give 5 stars is due to  the ridiculously long wait of almost 2 hours.  My friends and I ordered some cocktails while we waited.  I appreciated the host informing us that we'd be seated soon, and brought a complimentary stuffed pretzel for us to share.  So cheesy and good!  I loved the mustard dip that accompanied it.Once seated, we were greeted with complimentary champagne and olives.  We feasted family style, ordering the broccolini, Kentucky Fried Quail, and Lobster Pot Pie.  The portions were perfect for us three ladies, and I appreciated the pace at which each dish came out (especially with a small table).We were too stuffed for dessert, but I'll definitely be back.Parking is easy too (even though I got a ticket for expired plates)!"
"I was rufied there and then kicked out by the staff. But you know what, I had a great time. Gotta love the place. And thank god for cake. I feel like it saved my life somehow. Oh wait, maybe that was punch house... Remind me of how they are different???"
"The best brunch that we've had in a long time!! It was Father's Day weekend so they were taking reservations. Normally they do not take reservations for brunch. Hubby loved the bloody Mary and eggs Benedict. My Dutch baby was gone in seconds and I had a perfectly cooked egg on the side. The service was good and the space is big enough that, even when it's crowded, you never feel crowded in on."
"The food was excellent.  In terms of quality I would be surprised if they don't follow Longman with a 1 star or at least a bib gourmand.  The blue crab and corn risotto was melt in your melt good, excellent flavor profile with bacon, mushrooms and tomato flavors mixed in.  The Morracan Spiced Vegetable Tagine was almost equally good, great veggie dish that can almost make up a whole meal.  Also tried the Juicy Lucy, one of the best burgers the city has to offer, it has a homemade type velveeta cheese mixed in, on top of bacon and other flavors that come together perfectly in your mouth.  I am eager to go back and sample more.  Also it wasn't too hard to get to from downtown at around 7 pm, it's not too far off of the 18th St. exit on 90/94Only two small gripes, that are probably not the norm here. One we were given a bad table right next to where they are running food out of the kitchen, I liked seeing all the plates running out but most in the group didn't find the spot enjoyable. However we were a party of 5 without reservations on a Tuesday.  So easy fix is make reservations or don't complain.  Second, server seemed in over his head and he was slow.  Not sure if they were short staffed or he just couldn't handle his job but it seemed we were constantly waiting on drinks, courses and for the bill at the end."
"Okay so I LOVEEED Dusek's! It was one of the best meals I had in 2013, yes, it was THAT good. Location is a little farther than I'm used to but I hear that Pilsen is up and coming which was kind of cool to learn. The atmosphere at Dusek's is totally my style it's like a Gilt Bar meets Maude's liquor bar in terms of decor. It's casual, yes rustic with the brick walls, the funky chandeliers, totally loved the atmosphere. I know they don't take reservations so I called when we were literally 5 minutes away and the girl told me there is no wait but that could change. 5 minutes later we came in and I come up front, see a few empty tables, expect to get seated and she says ""oh the wait is an hour and a half!"" Say WHAT?! Um, no. I told her that I just spoke with her and she's like sorry, it changed. In 5 minutes? Did 20 large parties just walk in? I saw this table towards the back that looked communal and told her if we are out by 8pm (it was currently 6:30pm) could we be seated? And so we had a deal. But that was kind of the only annoyance of the night.Now onto the food, it was amazing. Everything tasted so fresh and I'm craving it all every day. We started with some beers which were okay, they are known for their brewery. We also did the oysters which I typically love, but these were just a tad over fishy for me. So we moved onto the blue crab dip with warm bread, and it was just incredible. We shared it with our friends and I really wish we hadn't, it was that good. We also got their Iron roasted mussels with warm harissa butter in this spicy sauce. These were incredible and for $13 totally a huge portion. Dusek's scores on that! The highlight of the night came when we got the classic Maine Lobster roll on a New England split bun. It was overflowing with lobster, I think it was around $20 but soooo worth it, I split it with my hubby and we each had chunks upon chunks of lobster. It was one of the best I've had, almost as good as in Boston! It also came with the duck fat fries which were okay. I would prefer some simple sweet potato fries, but that's just me. By this point we were stuffed from oysters, crab, mussels, lobster, I think we had the entire ocean. But nope,  I had to get their chocolate bar dessert. Wow, you have to get it and if Dusek's ever takes it off the menu, I will protest big time. It was incredible, rich and crispy with marshmallows and it was like a 5 star restaurant presentation. Overall, Dusek's you rock my world. Loved the atmosphere which wasn't too loud and allowed us to hear each other speak. Didn't love the oysters, but truly enjoyed everything else and can't wait to come back here to try some more of your goodies! Also, despite our 8pm check out time, we didn't feel rushed at all, I think we even left around 8:15pm no problem."
"To get to the restrooms is a bit of a journey, and if you run into what looks like a window, be careful it may actually be a door.Price points are surprisingly on the lower side, but we're not in River North so things may be a little cheaper.  Good thing for patrons.Bread was delicious and the lobster pot pie is a must order.  I'm usually wary of shared plates as I don't get full but I felt very satiated after this meal.  It would be nice if we could get Punch House punches here, but I understand why you can't.  Dusek's drink menu is just as credible as what you get downstairs.Very comfortable room with a surprising amount of space.  Good place for a casual date night."
"I don't like tables in restaurants that are so close together that you are essentially dining with strangers. I understand if space is at a premium, but, given the size of Dusek's this doesn't seem to be an issue. The first (and only) time we dined at Dusek's we were amazingly lucky in that we didn't have to wait for a table at 7:00 on a Saturday. We wanted to sit at the bar but all seats were taken. Oh how i wish two seats had been open...The hostess takes us to our table, which is approximately 2-3 inches from the table next to it, and a lovely couple was having a lovely evening, enjoying a lovely meal. Until I arrived. I'm not rail thin, but I'm also not a behemoth. I guess I thought me and my ass, and by cross-body purse, could all make it thru the 3 inch area between the tables to sit on the bench. No. My purse hit the bottle of beer on the table next to us, which went sailing into the lap of the lovely woman who until that point, had been having a lovely evening. A very large bottle of beer, too, that was full. I was mortified, and had I been able to dig a hole in the floor and disappear, I gladly would have. After I apologized 100,000 times to the lovely couple, and they were thankfully moved to a dry area, the staff came by with towels for the bench. That's another thing: the bench? Yeah, it's fabric, so when an entire bottle of beer spills it takes forever to dry. So, not only did the lovely couple have to move, they also couldn't sit anyone else there for quite some time, since the fabric was soaked. A suggestion to Dusek's: maybe make a tad bit more room in between the tables? Unless your customer base is all the size of skeletons, I foresee this happening again. The staff was so unbelievably kind to me, which I really appreciated. They acted like it was no big deal and did so with a smile. Thank you for that :). This also bumped them from 4 to 5 stars. They could have made me feel worse than I did (if that's possible) but they didn't. Now for the food: outstanding. We shared the country ham sampler, a dozen oysters, and the ramp risotto. Hands down that ramp risotto is the best thing I've ever put in my mouth, and I've put a lot of good things in my mouth. The ham sampler comes with enough ham to satisfy a ham craving for a good month. If you like ham, I highly recommend this. My husband loved their beer selection, and I had one of their craft pop selections, blackberry,  with vodka on the side. It was yummy and tart and refreshing and delicious. We didn't have room for dessert, so after we bought a round of drinks for the lovely couple that I soaked in beer, we made our way out. Not only do I want to return to Dusek's for the yummy food, I need to redeem myself. Hopefully there will be seats at the bar."
"I loved everything about Dusek's except my entree.  I've visited Dusek's twice now, both times for dinner.  The appetizers, drinks, desserts, and service were exceptional.  However, I seem to always pick the bad egg when it comes to entrees.  My first visit, I ordered some coffee rubbed beef rib and it was just overly salty.  I tried all my friends' dishes and they were fantastic.  My second visit, I ordered the soft shell crab sandwich.  Not only was the crab soggy, it was also under-seasoned.  I was so disappointed - and again, my date's meal was delicious.I'm not giving up on Dusek's yet though.  I'll just have to get my friends to pick my entree since I'm terrible at it.Their desserts are a MUST try!"
"Dusek's! You are great. In every way. I showed up at Dusek's with my boyfriend last Friday evening around 8:30. Our wait time was somewhere between an hour and an hour and a half (no reservations for groups less than 5). Patience is NOT my virtue, not even a little bit, but the bar downstairs (Punch House) was a lot of fun and the time flew by. We tried the Sanyal Punch & the Space Juice for Jered; my favorite being the latter. The price of $8/cocktail really isn't bad in the city, especially for how good they are. Once we got to our table, I was feeling pretty, pretty good so obviously we ordered a ton of food like the tipsy foodies we are:- Iron Roasted Prince Edward Island Mussels: GET THESE. Just. Do. It. - Venison Tartare: Get this too. I apologize I don't provide further details other than you should put this in your face but that's really all you need to know. - Broccolini: One of the best side dishes I've had in Chicago.- Wood Roasted Columbia River Sturgeon: This dish was wonderful but not that memorable... I was probably five drinks in by this point though so that could have had something to do with it. - Chocolate Bar: Dave & I never order dessert, again this last-minute order was probably due to to the gallon of gin we had now ingested, but SERIOUSLY get this too. Drinks @ Dinner:- House Gin & Tonic- Sharing the Feathered Crown (my favorite drink of the night)Take everyone you know here and people will think you are way cooler than you really are."
Back again for some Oyster Hash. Definitely a great spot for brunch. You won't regret your decision to enjoy this Longman and Eagle sequel.
Try Dusek's bar downstairs. The mustard horseradish served with the Bavarian Pretzel is awesome. Definitely worth taking a trip to Pilsen for that alone. The bartenders downstairs are also friendly.
"What can I say about Dusek's? It was noted as the top restaurant in Chicago back in the spring. Girlfriends and I went the same weekend the magazine came out. Not the smartest move but we needed to get out of the house.We arrive and madame hostess said it would be at least a 45 minutes wait to 2 hours wait so we said, let's push over some people and sit at the tiny lounge area. Even though the wait was supposed to be over 45 minutes, we didn't see anyone standing around waiting for a table so we knew we could wait it out. Sure enough, after 15 minutes of sipping wine and tasting cheese on the tiny chairs, we scored a table for 3 ladies on a Friday night. Let's be clear. The portions are not big and the prices are high. Are you sure this restaurant is in Pilsen? Yes, yes it is. We had the cheese plate, a bottle of sancerre (~45 for the bottle), fresh baked cheese stuff pretzel (is that cheezwhiz in the center?), the smoked mussels, some type of beef with sour kraut, and other items that I can't recall. It was all pretty good. The smoked mussels was the standout. Spicy and smoky. So good that we ordered one more to go to take home to the husbands for taking care of the kids so the mommies could have a Friday night out. On another late evening this fall, I went back with the hubby. We had the seafood tower. Not too impressive. But we lived in France for 6 years, so to be fair, they had a very high bar to reach. And it was not filling. So for $30 bucks a person, we would not recommend this. We tried the smoked mussels again. What happened to the mussels? Half didn't open and the ones that did open were shriveled up little suckers. The fries were fantastic. Salty and crispy. They still had the cheez whiz in the pretzel. They have guava flavored beer. That was the highlight of the meal."
Excellent service and comfortable environment. Nice dim lighting upstairs for dining and a more lively area with music downstairs. I prefer the juicy lucy but I also enjoy the mussels. Beer #24 is my choice. The Duseks punch also packs a lot of buzz. The deserts are creative and tasty. Again the service is outstanding and the kitchen is open late. Great go to place in Pilsen. P.s. No televisions but that's ok you don't need them here.
"The ambiance in this restaurant is wonderful!  We started by getting a special that was three small courses with a flight of paired beers. WOW! Everything was delicious, and the beers were perfect for the dishes we got. The beer selection is excellent here. I also got the lobster roll, which was very good, not exceptional. The beef fat fries that came along with it were delicious!After dinner, we headed down to the bar in the basement to continue the night, and had some excellent cocktails."
"I came here with a party of 8 on a weekday evening. I made reservations in advance and they were very accommodating when I kept increasing the reservation size. The mussels were good and we came at a time when they had an oyster special, so that was a great deal. I had the bbq fresh gulf prawns, which was excellent. The portion was a little small, but I don't stuff my face as much anymore. If you have a huge appetite, you may need to order something else to fill you up. They had an interesting dessert selection. Luckily, my table ordered pretty much one of each and I got to try everything. :)"
"Upscale food with great craft beer selection that is priced well ($5 standard, with some specials).  I walk the line between trashy and classy, and this place fars a little too far on the side of classy for my tastes.Like, they have burgers and cheese sandwiches, but they're like $18.  And they're $18 because they have things fancy sounding things like ""rosemary avocado aoli"", ""pickled okra"", and ""duck dick confit"" slathered on them.  And they're good, but man, it's a fucking cheese sandwhich and I'd rather spend my $18 on my fetlife-pro membership.Also, I'm worried this place will speed up the transformation of Pilsen into a hell on earth like Wicker Park.  Also there are a few other annoying things:- You can't sit down at a table unless you're eating, despite the fact that there are like 19 tables vacant (I counted one time)- The waiters are always policing where you hang out in the restaraunt, they don't want you drinking your beer too close to someone who's eating their $22 duck dick confit.Major Plus- They have a LOT of good beers, and they don't charge you more for a beer that's got more ABV.  Meaning you can order a bunch of $5 10% ABV beers and be smashed with $15.  WHAT A DEAL.I like/hate this place."
Awesome bar in the basement.  Food was great.  Prices fair.  Desert was only ok and the food was pretty darn salty.   Atmosphere really wins a prize here.  Not too crowded and good service.   Great overall feel.   Good place to go with a group of friends and take your time.
"There was a bit of a wait on a Saturday night, so we went down to Punch House for a few drinks. By the time our table was ready upstairs, I was nice and tipsy - ready to mangia. Everything was super delicious. Their bread is really really really good. Highlights:- blue crab dip - so good you won't want to share. - pretzel with mustard dip - this looks more like a croissant/tastes like a pretzel. Very good if you like horseradish mustard.-lobster pot pie - omg so good. -duck fat fries with romesco dipping sauce. -sweetbreads - very good, but a little too spicy for me. Ambiance is dark and romancey. Great for a super casual date night or girls night out. Service was stellar."
"Let me preface this by stating for the record: I'm not a hipster, but hipsters make awesome food. I love going out to hipster bars after a late night shift. The people who work there are usually tattooed and bearded, and don't mind that I'm in scrubs. Went there and was pleasantly surprised. The interior is a really cool, restored old building. The Punch was awesome. The food was amazing. Got the Juicy Lucy and beef tendon (which tasted like a better version of chicharron). My drinks were the gin based punch and a nitro beer (the Rasputin). Both were awesome. My friend got the old fashioned and the Dusek's #4, which were both very tasty as well. I want to go back to this place again. I'll maybe even buy a plaid shirt to fit in."
"So I just had brunch here and I definitely like the feel of this spot. Really laid back and comfy. So my boo and I came to try the dutch baby that we recently saw featured on tv, best ever pancake. Sure it was light and fluffy but super small. Mix between french toast and a funnel cake. What I did love though was the benedict and the punch cocktail. All I can say is yummy. Def a different turn on Benedict's but the sour dough bread and hash browns are amaze balls. You have to try the brunch punch cocktail it will have u feeling warm inside and ready for a second. Def will come back and try more of the menu."
"Yay!This is my new go-to in the 'hood.First off, the space is really amazing. On a cold Chicago evening, it feels warm and cozy and like the kind of place you want to hang out for hours shooting the shit with friends and having drinks. I had the juicy Lucy and hubs got the chicken livers. We both enjoyed our food, but his dish was really small. Thankfully he wasn't too hungry, but if it had been me, I would've been pretty disappointed. My burger was delicious, but I did lose all the cheese inside on the first bite when it squirted out of my burger into my lap (literally, there was cheese running down my body). The duck fat fries are some of the best I've had with a good crunch and flavor.The service was good, but I hate when people come by to fill up your water after every sip. There was a carafe on the table; I can do it myself or you can come when my glass is empty. It felt awkward having someone maneuvering around our table every three to five minutes.The price was right. We're excited to try more dishes here and make it our new place to take friends and family."
"First time for everything. Had the platter of oysters which were just like anywhere else. Had a mix of east & west coast. The pound of mussels were good! Strangely seasoned with a paprika cayenne pepper. Served dry (no broth.) it was tasty but a bit to dry for my liking. Cheese plate mix of cow, Brie, and goat cheese didn't pique my interest as it was a mild trio of cheeses. Dusecks doesn't take resos for small parties so we had mixed cocktails downstairs while waiting 40 minutes on Saturday night. Space juice for jered is a super strong tequila drink!"
"This is a 4-4.5 star restaurant, but I feel compelled to dock a star for some issues with our evening. 1. We were quoted an hour wait, we waited close to 1.5 hours. 2. An iron book end fell off the wall and nearly hit my husband in the head. Obviously, not anyone's fault, but an apology or something would of been appropriate. Now that the issues are out of the way, let's focus on all the things that Dusek's is winning at: 1. I love the vibe of the restaurant. It is a restored building in Pilsen and the low lighting and throw back decor make it a perfect setting for showcasing their incredible food. 2. The menu is split up into sea, land, and grains and vegetable and generally listed from small/light dishes at the top, to the larger/heavier dishes at the bottom. I thought the simple organization really helped with picked a well-rounded dinner and having some insights into the portions.3. The food was phenomenal. Every flavor and texture was thought about. Nothing was on the plate that didn't add a special element to the dish. We ordered the following: -Chef's choice of oysters- they were served with mini oyster crackers that added a tiny bit of crunch. The smallest ones were my least favorites, but the other two varieties made up for it. -Broccolini- side dishes are usually an afterthought, but this dish had some serious flavors going on. A little bit of vinegar, and crunch of pine nuts and radishes, and the sweetness of raisins. I wasn't expecting much for a side of broccolini, but this was a standout. -BBQ Fresh Gulf Prawns- a play on shrimp and grits with a rich BBQ sauce, braised greens, and a perfectly cooked egg. Once the yolk spread into the mix, this turned into a fabulous mix of creamy and smoky flavors. Adding an egg was a creative touch that really elevated the dish. -Lobster Pot Pie- I saw raving reviews for this on Yelp, so we ordered it. The bowl came with a beautiful golden crust, a sprinkling of greens, and a dollop of butter (I think). I used a spoon to break through the crust and get at the filling. The filling contained large chunks of lobster and potato and a seafood gravy. I thought the dish needed some seasoning, and with a sprinkle of salt, the dish went up a couple notches. I will be back. The food on the tables around us looked equally delicious and I enjoyed the vibe. Next time I will come with a reservation, and will be sure to watch for falling objects."
"Everyone's been raving about Dusek's, but I was not too impressed. I have been to Punch House in the lower level on a separate occasion, and it is quite wonderful. My friend and I came here for dinner over the weekend. We planned on going to Skylark afterwards for drinks and tots (can't not have tots), so we wanted to get something lighter. We sat outside at Dusek's, which was quite lovely indeed. We ordered the stuffed pretzel, which was fine. The dipping sauce is quite spicy and tasty. There was not much cheese stuffed in that pretzel though. I ordered the heirloom tomato and stone fruit salad. It was good, but a ridiculously small portion for $12. Before I ordered it, I asked the waiter what the portion size was, and he said it was a normal salad portion. I guess we have different ideas of what that means. Let me stop here and say that I'll definitely pay more money for a thoughtful and delicious dish. The salad, though, was not fantastic. The flavors were 1-dimensional, and the plating was not that great. Offerings for vegetarians are at a minimum, unless there's a secret menu I don't know about. My friend ordered the lobster roll ($24). She said it was pretty good, but she's had better for less. The lobster roll came out much later than my salad. When we asked the waiter about it, he said he misunderstood, assumed that we were sharing everything, and had coursed out our dishes. That would have been fine, except that he did not ask if we wanted our food coursed out. Dusek's definitely did not live up to my expectations. The food was okay--not great--especially for the pricing."
"This place is Excellent and very worth the wait. Johnny was our server and quite the encyclopedia when it came to the menu and history of the place. The Mussels, Steak, Duck, and Lobster were Delicious. Looking forward to returning real soon."
"We went to Duseks, with friends, for my husband's birthday.  We were seated promptly.  The waitstaff and wine selection were outstanding.I ordered a cheese plate for the table (should have ordered 2) and a lobster roll for my entree.  This is where the MEH part comes in.   I grew up in Maine, so I know my lobster.  Duseks needs to work mightily on their lobster roll.  The bun was a massive amount of bread.   The lobster had minimal kick (okay..no kick) and was WARM.  The fact that the lobster meat was NOT chilled really grossed me out.   If they chill their lobster and give it a bit of taste, I'll be back. They need to check out Mabel's lobster roll in Kennebunkport to really rock the LR."
Interesting and unique selection of beers and food - all of them very good.
"Enjoyed a good dinner here. The beer list is top shelf excellent, and on that strength alone we make it up to 4 stars. The food was all good, interesting and well presented. But most of the dishes we got felt like they were just shy of great. Often just a slightly off mix of flavors or textures. Examples, risotto was good but a little too salty. Pork belly was good, but a little too sweet. Beef was good but a bit bland, and the puffed tendon was almost too crunchy to eat. The juicy lucy burger was -very- good, still just a burger, but a really good one. Desserts were good too, though again, just short of excellent. All around, it was a very good meal and I would eat there again, but the main draw would be the beer list and the atmosphere. Service was outstanding too."
"I enjoyed my brunch. I went with the beer and board which is potatoes, eggs, bacon and toast and a mimosa. The food was good. I really enjoyed the potatoes. The eggs were moist and fluffy. I finished it off with a Dark Matter coffee and a big @$$ doughnut glazed with blackberry? jam. The vibe was chill and the service was prompt and courteous. I definitely plan to return."
"Duske's optimizes thoughtfulness. This is sort of a ""perfect"" restaurant and the devil is in the details. I first noticed that beer taps at the bar.  More in a second...I could tell as I was parking my car and looking inside the restaurant through the gorgeous hand painted windows that I was in for a treat. Everyone looked happy and the lighting was perfect. There was a small wait for a table, so we enjoyed beers at the bar. The bartender was friendly and the beer selection was fantastic. There are numerous tabs of beer, but notably none of them have the typical branded wood / plastic pulls. There are no visual cues as to what beers they serve and ... I don't... I'm not sure why but I really like this visual cue that tells you to trust the bartender. I asked for the most sour beer, and was provided some great options! I enjoyed a saison while we killed a little time and the vibe was just wonderful. I'm going to stop right now and say ... well... this place has perfected what they are trying to do. ""Trying"" in fact, almost feels like an insult because Dusek's doesn't need our help or input. They have everything covered, and I LOVE that this is the new Chicago. SOLID presentation of FANTASTIC food in a PERFECT setting. So anyways... the menu changes daily and everything I'm about to describe may be gone tomorrow, and that's ok. Because everything was really good and I expect everything coming out of the kitchen in general will be spot on.Once seated, our server Catherine was wonderful and helped guide us through the menu. There aren't a ton of options, but it all sounded so lovely and it was kind of hard to decide what to get... so we opted to get a few things and share as a group.We started with a flight of East Coast oysters. Very delicious and briny, but all required a little helping from the oyster fork. Delicious way to start the meal and will be ordered again!Next up was the asparagus salad. The asparagus itself was blanched and served warm (but not hot) with a tossing of dressing and lettuce. Great textures and flavors come from this simple dish and I kind of wished I had a whole portion to myself.Following the salad, we were served that evening's burger. Frankly I'd avoid the ""juicy loosey"" not because it was bad... because in fact it was really good. But it felt like the most pedestrian option on the table. Not particularly notable, a little over cooked, and the expected interior cheese was barely there. But the beef fat fries? Oh my word! They alone elevated the entire plate into something magical. Every single bit of potato was consumed by our table.And speaking of potatoes... holy mother of god! What sort of witch craft was used to make the morel mushroom potato salad served with the 1/2 chicken? Dark magic no doubt! It was AMAZING! Smoky, creamy and perfectly seasoned. It was really a wonderful accompaniment that almost overshadowed the delicious chicken which was clearly not shipped from a perdue factory.We let our server know we were sharing, and the kitchen did a wonderful job at pacing the dishes. We enjoyed every bite and when the dessert menu was delivered we all agreed we were properly satiated and passed on the sweets. Everything about the ambiance, from the perfectly dark lighting to the friendly service made us feel at home and really... I wouldn't mind living at Dusek's. They've got a great bar in the basement, and a music venue on the second floor. It's a cool ecosystem and a great addition to Chicago's nightlife."
"So I have zero complaints about this place! I've been here twice so far and both time I was not disappointed. The food is great, the prices are reasonable and the drinks are delightful!The first time, they had just opened and my friend and I came to check the place out. I was immediately excited to see they had lobster rolls on the menu. Obviously, I ordered that and it was soooo tasty! I also got a drink that I can't remember the name of but it had a stout beer in it. It was SO good!. I can't even remember what my friend got because I was so into my meal. She was happy though... Service was great, which can sometimes be tricky with a new resto. After ward we went downstairs to Punch House to try out some of their cocktails and that place was pretty cool. It looks like someone's cool uncle's basement from the 70s. I loved it. On my second visit, I was able to reserve a table for a large group for brunch for my sister's birthday. Generally our friends are pretty open to new things, but it's like pulling teeth to get our parents into new restaurants. So, reluctantly they came and I must say the shrimp and grits won them over! We had a variety of entrees and cocktails across the table and no one complained (except the one friend who couldn't stand looking in the face of her shrimp. LOL!) And it was unanimous that the beermosas were a brilliant idea!]Get you butt's to Pilsen and have some good food and a good time (maybe go before a show upstairs at Thalia Hall...That's my plan for my next visit.)"
"I loved the atmosphere at Dusek's! What a great little bar/restaurant in Pilsen. The place is filled with beautiful mahogany wood, a copper or tin ceiling, and an exposed brick wall. The other walls have been painted a bright blue, adding a splash of color and interest. And you have to love the chalkboard walls in and outside the bathroom, where patrons have signed their names or added quotes.Drinks at the bar were fantastic. The restaurant creates its own tonic for its House Gin and Tonic, and it's very nice, though the glasses in which it is poured are a bit small (compared to other cocktails offered at the same price). They don't have many white wines by the glass, but I found a pleasant pinot grigio blend and was happy.The menu looks amazing, but the dishes themselves fell a bit short. I really enjoyed the boneless duck wings in a house-made hot sauce - in fact, they were probably the best dish I had all night. Yet I feel like I know two or three other restaurants that serve something quite similar...in other words, nothing I can't get elsewhere. The duck fat frites were way too salty. And the biggest letdown of the night was certainly the mussels, which was a shame because I was most excited about them! Yet they were so covered in smoked pimenton that they were actually really unpleasant. I couldn't even get the other three people at my table to eat them!Overall, I liked the atmosphere at Dusek's, but I wouldn't return for the food."
"I had a unique experience at Dusek's. Partially unacceptable, partially fantastic. At the end of the day, I reward them for how they handled a poor mistake. Service situation aside, the food is fantastic and the drinks were strong and tasty.I drove south to Pilsen for the sole reason of tasting the fine fare of Duseks. The restaurant is huge - it seems as if there should be seating for all comers, and I had no wait during prime time Sunday brunch hour.My friend and I each ordered the burger and a bloody mary. The bloody was awesome, a refreshingly light tomato juice with a fantastic rim of salt and seasoning. The burger was also fantastic - a no frills experience, cooked to perfection. I've eaten many of the burgers that Chicago has to offer; it was no Au Cheval, but it is in the Chicago top 5. Unfortunately, my burger did not come out as normally scheduled. The chef accidentally tossed out my ticket before preparing the ticket. This mistake was not realized until about an hour later. Fortunately, the server comped the meal and our bloodys. Definitely worth the hour!I think Duseks is worth the drive to Pilsen, especially to avoid the Sunday brunch crowd in downtown Chicago. If its busy, walk a block and find a tamale. Those are all five stars."
"Went for weekend brunch and loved it. Food was top-notch, drinks were great. My rating would've been 5 stars but for the slow service. The staff was friendly and knowledgeable but just too slow and not the most attentive. Great food though. Start with one of the pastry selections and coffee and then opt for the oyster hash with the Brunch Punch, if you want to enjoy a little brunch libation."
"Obviously this a great addition to the Pilsen area.  Everybody is happy its there, me too.  But the food was not spectacular, it was ok, but not a destination.  I prefer Nightwood nearby.  The boneless duck wing appetizer was a disappointment.  What is that??? The oysters-good but that is not cooking.The chicken liver dish-gravy was excellent, we cleaned it up. Duck fat fries and romesco-normal.Choucroute-lots of sauerkraut with susage, duck confit, pork belly-quite good.Beer selection is great and the drinks are good. The decor is really great and restaurant is spacious.I would go for drinks and try again, but not craving any of the food ."
"The food selection can be pretty exciting here. They switch the menus a lot but some of the items stick around, like the one-hour cooked egg or bbq shrimp and grits, both excellent. From the snacks to the entrees, there's innovation and the flavors are usually spot-on. I found a few items to be a miss though, like the sweetbread. The inside is real spacey and there's always a bunch of clamor going on, a good place for groups to chill and have some beers and be rowdy."
"Not what we expected. Its in a transition neighborhood a short drive from the loop. Really nice craft beer selection and the menu helps you to align the beers with the food. They have flights for sampling and an eclectic menu, we did the mussels and Choucroute for apps and I had the Juicy Lucy a real good burger with their fries that are excellent. I wish we had more time that night because there is a very trendy/cool cocktail bar in the basement that looks like a lot of fun."
"I am giving this place 4 stars for dinner and the punch room.Dusek's was delicious for dinner. It's one of those places that you will look at the menu, order things, and have no idea what you are getting yourself into. I ate almost everything on the menu, and I didn't hate a single thing that I ate. I highly recommend eating dinner here, and if you do, you MUST go to the punch room. The punch room is a basement bar at Dusek's, and you can only get their fabulous adult punches in the bar here. They will be served in 50s style glassware and pitchers, and you will love it.  Also, get the churros and chocolate for dessert!Brunch was another story. I had heard that brunch at Dusek's was delicious, but we just found it to be rather mediocre. We ordered the dutch baby and the omelet, and neither one was satisfactory. The dutch baby was hardly stuffed with anything, and the omelet had way too many onions. I would recommend a visit to Dusek's for dinner, but skip it for brunch."
"I haven't been back in this area since 2009 and it has changed! I stopped by here after visiting Laguintas Brewery and let me tell you, this place is going to last. Great beer and drink list. We arrived right before dinner service so there were a few people in here having drinks. I would definitely come back for dinner or brunch."
"Had an A La Card to use for this location. Was excited to try something new in neighborhood I had never been. Went on a Friday evening around 8pm.Very disappointed across the board.  Long wait - 45+ minutes. Poor service - the waitress only stopped by to take our orders and give us the check. The food was so-so at best.Ordered the Ramp Risotto which was pretty good but nothing special. The better of the two meals I ordered with my girlfriend.  The second dish was the Fried Catfish dish with a bean salad - very bland and the fish had an unpleasant taste and texture.  Bottom line is not impressed and disappointed with the food.The server did NOT check to see how our food was. Did NOT see if we needed any other drinks.Would NOT recommend this restaurant to any of my friends.  Maybe I came on a bad night, but I personally will not be returning."
"We came here for Saturday brunch around noon, and it wasn't not as crowded as I anticipated. I ordered oyster hash, and my father ordered the hanger steak and eggs. It took about 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive. Usually I don't mind that kind of wait for food, but the food was served room temperature, which was disappointing AND the portions were really small.. Don't get me wrong, the food was great. I loved the pork belly in the oyster hash, even if it was just one small piece. And the chimichurri sauce for the steak was good, but a bit too salty. We were still hungry so we ordered the challah cinnamon roll. I also expected the roll to be warm, but it was just stiff and seemed stale. There were 2 flies that landed on the roll (icky), but our server was nice enough to bring out a new one. The food is definitely good, but because our food was served room temperature for a long wait, I had to lower my rating."
"Cute atmosphere, good food and good service. However, it was quite pricey."
"Way cool environment. Friendly & layer back staff, loved the Manager. We ordered the Juicy Lucy Cheeseburger and the sausage sandwich....YUMMY! Definitely a hit. We had our 12 year old with us and he really wasn't a fan of the menu bc the offerings are definitely distinct and unique. I'd say this place is more for the grown & sexy :)"
"I have been there once for dinner, and many times for brunch (I live a couple blocks away and it has become a regular visit on the weekends for me), when I sit at the bar.The food is always amazing, no matter what I order and the menu is continually tweaked, so I am able to get something new all the time. The bar staff (Gordon, Monica, Jack) is incredibly attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable as well. Always a pleasant weekend experience.There was only one time when we were there as a group and the food took awhile to come out...but instead of having to ask about it, the server and management proactively apologized, gave us updates, then gave us complimentary campaign!"
Best upscale downscale  food south of Madison. Hipster vibe with retro style in Uber chic Pilsen. Romantic and cool and great service. Can't miss!
"I like Dusek's a lot. I've been once for dinner and once for brunch. The general atmosphere of the restaurant is very cozy and warm, spot on for a nice date night or longer meal. It's really cool that the restaurant is a historic building, and they have old photographs and such that show you that history. Food is always great here. Their juicy lucy burger was a huge hit when I came for brunch. They also have an extensive cocktail and beer list, which we really enjoyed. For dinner, I came with a group of 4 and it was a perfect spot for sharing various dishes. I recall the mussels and the risotto being absolutely delicious. I'd definitely recommend this for someone looking to branch out from their regular spots. It's in Pilsen, which was a nice mix-up for us. I'd love to come back and bring some friends here!"
"If you put your lips to a Juicy Lucy and the meat is hot, beware -if you bite down just a little, it will squirt juices right in your face. That may sound dirty/hot, and it definitely would be if the Juicy Lucy wasn't a Minneapolis-style hamburger stuffed with melted cheese, but I mean this as a serious warning:  If you bite into one of these things soon after is placed in front of you, it *will* squirt a high velocity stream of steaming hot, molten cheese and burger juice right into your face/nose/eyes. So let your Juicy Lucy cool off for a bit and enjoy the duck fat frites before grabbing those buns. You have been warned. Anyhow, Dusek's has other, less dangerous/non-squirty stuff on the menu too, venison tartar and duck meatloaf and oysters, basically exactly what you would expect from a higher-end hipster gastropub that just opened in a hot (i.e., gentrifying) neighborhood. Often that description would be a warning to stay away, but the food here's really good, as one would expect given that it's by the same people who did Longman & Eagle. Drink list is good too, and everything is served by your standard tattooed and/or well-bearded types, all of whom come off as reasonably pleasant and friendly. Worth checking out if you're in the area on an off-night, but the wait will likely put you off if you're here during prime time on a weekend."
I ate dinner here recently and loved everything I had. The risotto was excellent and the atmosphere is very artsy and fun.
"Successful adventure completed!I considered Dusek's an adventure as it was off of my typical beaten path AND new AND my choice for dinner.  Normally none of these things would cause me concern, however, I really wanted to have a perfect evening.  Lucky me - I did!  First of all, Dusek's has great atmosphere.  Two bars to sit and wait in and a really friendly staff definitely helps when you have a wait (and a 35 min wait on a weekend wasn't a deal breaker for me, but if it had been, I would have been happy to sit in either bar for snacks and a cocktail).  The restaurant is really nicely lit (not too dark, but sets a nice mood).  I thought it was also a nice set up in that the tables weren't smooshed together, so there was room to walk, stand near the bar and also sit at dinner tables.  Once we were seated, the trouble began.  And by trouble, I mean decision time...what to eat?! Everything sounded delicious and I really wanted to be able to try all options.  We settled on oysters, crab dip, lobster roll and burger.  I was thrilled with all of these.  Everything was flavorful, but not over the top (and the oysters were divine!).  Couple the great options with a great wine/bar list and it makes for no issues on the food/drink side.  It's only unfortunate that at some point, you get full and have to stop....or sit for HOURS (did I mention this spot serves late?!).Service was helpful, friendly and not overbearing.  Extra points for letting us move to a slightly more desirable table after we had ordered drinks (without even a little fuss!).I was having such a good time, I didn't want to leave (ok, it's possible that this wasn't 100% due to the restaurant, and likely also due to my dining companion), but nevertheless, this was a super spot and definitely worth a drive/cab/train/bus/walk to Pilsen to eat here (but actually don't go, because I don't want it to get more crowded).Food - 5Atmosphere - 5!!!Service - 5Value - 4 Bathrooms - 4 (would be a 5 if all stalls were working, but cute chalkboard walls and nicely done)."
"This place is great.  I went last week, for the fifth time, to celebrate with some friends and (like always) was extremely satisfied.  Bob at the bar and Johnny the server were provided particularly awesome service.  My friends and I shared the house pickles, a salmon dish, pork belly and duck with a homemade sausage!! All of which was incredible.  The flavors are so dynamic and the presentation is very pleasant on the eye.  This place is not expensive, it is exactly how much you should expect to be paying for this level of quality!"
"Great vibe, solid beer selection, good service. Unfortunately the food isn't up to snuff. Everything I tasted was SALTY-and this is coming from someone who likes her salt. Also, I was very disappointed with the preparation of the skate wing. I sent my first plate back because it was undercooked. The second plate was better, but still disappointing. For some reason they roll the skate rather than preparing it flat, thereby decreasing the surface area to get a good sear. The result is a plate that has less color and texture than it should. I'll try Dusek's again, but will stay away from the skate if it's still on the menu."
"dissapointed...went for dinner there on a thurs night w my husband. while the interior was very hip and modern, the feel of the restaurant was quite pretencious. it reminded me of logan sq and this just does not fit the neighborhood of pilsen.anyway, food was dissaponiting.. we got the pumpkin risotto (ok but nothing spectecular) and the beef bavette, which came out cold and medium- rare when we ordered it med- well. i never return the food nor complain to thrme server. the portion was small.. i wasnt fond the puffed tendon/fried nor of the horseraddish powder..?!im sure the drinks are decent but we're both giving up on etoh so we didnt have any.we skipped dessert."
"Food: 5 stars, service: 2 starsWe walked in on Sat night at prime dinner time with a big group and no reservation...what were we thinking? After being told about the 1.5hr wait, we proceeded downstairs to the punch house for some pre-dinner munchies and drinks. Service was friendly but super-slow. Pretty much right after we put in our appetizer & dessert (yes! they looked so enticing we decided to have pre-dinner desserts) orders, we were told our table would be ready in 5 minutes. WHAT?! Our server came over and assured us he'd personally communicated with upstairs so we can bring our food upstairs and have our desserts at the end of the meal. Whew~ *5 minutes later*Someone else came over and said our table would be ready in 5 min and someone will come get us.*5 minutes later* My friend and I, being the impatient types, decided to go up to host stand and find out about our table. To which they replied: it's ready! C'mon up! Er...where's the ""someone"" who was supposed to come get us? Ok, never mind.We finally got seated and started ordering. And so our 4 hour dinner begins. It took forever for the dishes to come out, the last of which we had to inquire 3 times before we saw it. Throughout the meal, the waiter came over twice to ask us if we're ready for our desserts, even though the downstairs waiter assured they'll wait 'til the end of our meal. The beer that came with the ""ordinary"" never came, and when we finally asked about it, we were told it ran out. Umm...so when were you gonna tell us that if we hadn't asked?Spotty service aside, EVERYTHING we ordered was amazing. I loved the sardines, duck breast & pork tenderloin. And wanted to hide in a corner with an entire bowl of the fried stout dessert. So yes, I'd totally come back for the food. I understand they are newly open and probably slammed by the amount of diners, but please work on the service issue! And also fix the ladies bathrooms! On my visit, 2 of the 3 were out of order (which was ok I guess since the food took forever too). Hopefully my next review would be the 5 stars they deserve!"
"I'm not a foodie but there was one or more at my table.  They liked Dusek's.  I had ""The Ordinary"".  It was different and very good.  The cheese app and pretzel were very good.  The desserts were excellent - shaved ice w/ dark rum and cookie dough/ice cream.  Like nothing I've had in the past.  The beer selection is impressive."
"The food is exceptional, executed with care, creativity, and art, and still manages to be hearty. The brunch cocktails are suprising, and work as tasting experiences as well as they work as breakfast hooch. My complaint is that the tables in the front room are much deeper than they are wide. This has the effect that you sit closer to those at the next table than to your companion. During my first visit, this meant that my difficult conversation with a lifelong friend about the rapid deterioration of his father's health was interrupted when the host put another diner directly next to us - even though there were many other free tables adjacent to no one else. I figured the place was still findings its sea legs and forgave the place after pointing the issue out to the host on my way out. She could not do anything about the tables, but she sure could have not placed someone right next to us when the place was mostly empty. And then the same thing happened when i went back six months later. Exceptional food with you will enjoy in the lap of strangers next to you, with little conversational privacy with your guest.. The host gave a sour face when I asked to be moved to the bar, but move us she did, and we had a wonderful meal."
"I honestly don't get it. People shouldn't have to work so hard to figure out what they're ordering. Sure -- they list the ingredients on the menu but there's no clue as to how it's going to arrive at your table. I own a hair salon and was interested to talk to clients who have also been there. They too were underwhelmed with the food.  Phew, it's not just me.Pros to this place - watching the bartenders prepare all of the cocktails. We sat at the bar and they couldn't have been more interesting to watch with lovely personalities to match. Honestly, the staff is wonderful.Go for the drinks. Sit at the bar. Order the wood-smoked olives to snack on. Stay away from the foie gras  bon bons. Completely disgusting."
"Possibly my most enjoyable dining experience in a year.Two dishes stood out: The Iron Roasted Calender Island Mussels because they taste like the perfect summer BBQ on the beach, and the Fried Stout for dessert, which is like a deconstructed Dunkin Donuts breakfast complete with coffee. The atmosphere is unpretentious and upscale; I wouldn't feel out of place dressing up a bit or wearing a hoodie. Draft beer list is exhaustive. Wait staff is friendly, helpful, and never let our water run low. All around superb dinner."
"Food and cocktails were phenomenal, also service was impeccable.  Our server China was very knowledgeable about the menu and made some great suggestions on drinks and answered our questions.  We started off with Roasted Olives and they were amazing!!  We had Iron Roasted Prince Edward Island Mussels and  Moroccan Spiced Vegetable Tagine for main course and they were superb.  For desert we shared English Pudding and Fried Stout, the pudding was great but highly recommend Fried Stout!  I had a couple of those Dusek Coolers and they were tasty, though I thought they were pretty strong; I was buzzed after 2 drinks but then again, I'm a 5'5 Asian, I have no credibility.  We cannot wait to check out some shows; got a private tour of the unfinished Thalia Hall and it is going to be an amazing venue!"
"Came to Dusek's with my husband, we had the soft shell crab which was deep fried and I find it hard to review because we love this place but this dish was not that great.  I think we expected the crab to be meatier. The drinks are always great and dangerous.  The pretzel is great, stuffed with cheese and a mustard dipping sauce.  Once again the mussels are great.   The staff is so nice."
"Great menu that's meant for sharing (family style). The food was very good. Loved all the menu from the seafood, veggies, and meat. All dishes were very flavorful. There's also a great variety of drinks to choose from, mainly beer! The only disappointing thing was the dessert, ordered a bread pudding, but it came out very dry, as if I was eating a brownie instead. It was also made out of sourdough, which made it even weirder.Over all experience was good, server was very helpful and friendly, food and drinks were as expected for one of the top new restaurants in Chicago."
A big question that comes up during brunch is whether to order from the brunch or lunch menu. There were plenty of options that sounded delicious but I went with the smoked mussels which I was very happy with. The only thing I would've changed with the dish is that I wish it came with bread because the harissa butter would've been perfect for dipping. I was happy with the portion too because the size of the mussels were decent too. I also had the pie spice beignet which was fluffy and light. I'm curious about the rest of the menu because it seems like there's a different take on typical brunch dishes. I would also come back at night for Punch House.
"Great food and drinks! Only complaint is that they don't allow substitutions (I got the chicken dish and asked if I could have fries instead of the potato salad because I had it before and didn't really enjoy it).  One of the bartenders literally squawked at me from across the bar and said that the chef doesn't allow it, but if I make a ""big deal"" then they'll comp the fries. I would never make scene but that made me pretty uncomfortable, and I would like to think that a restaurant that charges $22 for a chicken leg would be more accommodating."
"Went to Punch House for some drinks while waiting for our table--I'd definitely recommend doing the same. The punches are fun, but the couple I tried were all a bit on the sweet side for my taste. I suppose that comes with the territory, being punch and all. The Pimm's Cup punch was my favorite, since it was actually pretty bitter. Prices were good, bar snacks were good, drinks were good, and our bartenders were friendly and engaging.For the actual restaurant part, everything was great. The only minor issue we had was a stray olive pit that found its way into the sauce for my dish. I left with all my teeth intact, and the manager had a shot of whiskey with me and my entire party to make up for it. No harm, no foul."
"Although we live very far away from Pilsen, I thought it would be strategic to get a visit in before the hipster swarm begins, since it's not as immediately convenient as say some of the restaurants closer to my neck of the woods like sister resto, Longman & Eagle (chef Jared Wentworth designed the menu and L&U's GM, Will Duncan, the beverages both at Dusek's and the downstairs bar, Punch House.)Definitely a wise move. It was our anniversary and the atmosphere was perfect. We arrived around 7 p.m. The photos of the space during the daytime don't really do it justice. Since it was already dark out, the room just had this gorgeous, comfortable, low lit, but glowing vibe. I wanted to move in. Or never leave. It's considerably more spacious than L&U, in the lovely Thalia Hall building, with 2 adjacent dining areas. I usually hate sitting next to people when I'm sharing the same bench, but it didn't feel crowded here.Service was top notch. Our waiter has either had some great fine dining training, or really has an innate knack of shaping the experience. At times, it verbally bordered on slightly pretentious, but he was also very down to earth, giving us excellent beer recommendations based on what we were looking for. As for the food...every time my husband and I order appetizers, we end up being too full to deal with the rest of the meal and we knew we had some punch waiting for us downstairs, so didn't want to go into food coma mode. So we launched straight into the full meal. Hubs, a major burger lover, got the Juicy Luicy. I went adventurous (for me) with the chicken livers. I actually hate liver, and haven't had it since I was forced as a kid, but I felt compelled to try it. Once I got past the inherent liver texture and settled into the fact that it was nicely breaded and accompanied by delicious haricots verts and 2 teeny tiny buttermilk biscuits with gravy, I was fine. No dessert, due to the forthcoming punch. I loved it. Loved the restaurant, the menu (both food and beverages) and the service. If it was closer, I'd be there all the time."
It's great to enjoy well done food. I have to admit it's been a while since I've had such a well done meal. From the start it was awesome. We had a bunch of dishes and the drinks were superb. Hats off to them. Can't wait to go back.
"I had raved to my colleagues about the freshness and savory taste of the options at Dusek's . Last night myself and 9 of my co-workers met at Dusek's . They found the beer list tempting; the appetizers such as beer fat fries with a hadass mustard delightful and the olives and cheese just yummy! Everyone had something different . The vegetarians found their choice to tickle their palate and the carnivores ate duck confit and 32 ounce ribeye with equal jest.The prawns with grits were eaten quickly and in silence, no thought of sharing such a delicacy. Everyone really enjoyed their choice!The only down side was time. Service moved much slower than we would have liked."
"Amazing dining experience. Awesome atmosphere. Outstanding service!!! We went as a group of 4 and ordered dishes to share, and were impressed at every stage of our meal. The pork belly was incredible."
"Went for dinner and there was a decent crowd for a Tuesday night. However, I sat for one hour and fifteen minutes before I had any food. Perhaps I was annoyed from waiting so long, but the food itself wasn't anything exciting. I had pumpkin risotto and broccolini. All I tasted was butter and salt."
Great food and beautiful ambiance. Only problem is that this place is out of my budget and across the street so everytime I dine there I leave broke and still a little hungry
Great atmosphere in an up and coming area of Pilsen.  They have a great beer selection and we love their brunch on the weekends.  Crowd is a bit hipster but thats what you get for east Pilsen.
"The drinks are wonderful and the beer list is long (though it is currently lacking anything from Chicago but I was told this is being corrected). The decor is great and the staff are damn nice and very informative. Their pretzel was one of the better ones I've ever had.With that all said I have to wonder what the long term changes a place like this might cause to Pilsen. It's certainly an expensive, hip place in a part of the city that is still well known for its awesome cheapness. I don't see many of the families living in this neighborhood hitting this place up. That's not really the point I suppose."
"This place is the jam. I love going down toward Pilsen and Bridgeport and here is a great example of why more Chicagoans should. They are not only a great place to eat but the bar and music space are equally stellar. I had brunch there with two pretty laid back fellas and we all loved our meals. The staff is really young, fun and knowledgable. Sitting outside makes it even better. I'll definitely be back, hopefully for a show sometime!"
"Where to start...the cocktails. The list of standard and seasonal cocktail offerings is impressive. Slightly upper end of the price spectrum, but only slightly. Every drink had some familiarity, but also some form of the exotic. I had the Belgian Fashioned, which is their take on an Old Fashioned. I haven't had an Old Fashioned this good since I was last at Longman & Eagle (makes sense I guess). The bartender really took his time to perfect the drink. Stirred it carefully, checked the flavor and made a slight adjustment. The end product was smooth, slightly sweet, a bit of bourbon bite, and all around great.  Unfortunately, that was the only cocktail I tried that night, as I wanted to be functional for work the next morning, and I still wanted to try a few beers.And that brings us to the beer list. What a list. While I can appreciate all of the places in Chicago that offer the regional craft beers, you find yourself starting to run into the same beers from the same breweries. Dusek's beer list is very craft, but it goes global. Want to try a smoked porter from Germany? You will likely find it on Dusek's draft list. They also have a ""Cause Beer"" which is a novel concept. The proceed from the selected beer to towards a local charity. And as a ""beer forward"" restaurant, they make several attempts to properly pair food and beer.  And that brings us to the food.  We went on a Sunday, with the intention of ordering the Sunday Supper. This is a three course meal that comes with a pitcher of beer. $25/person. The danger there is that the rest of the menu is so dang good that you find yourself wavering away from the Sunday Supper and into the other delights; which is exactly what our group did. I went with ""The Ordinary"". The Ordinary is a paired food and beer offering. I think it rotates weekly or so. This one was a veal prepared three ways. It was delicious, and a very nice sized entree.One of my friends ordered the scallops.  The server told him that it was a small dish.  She wasn't kidding. It was tiny. He said that it tasted great, but he did end up ordering a pretzel afterwards. So yeah, watch out for small plates.My other friend ordered the duck meatloaf, and she was very impressed.  Again, a nice sized entree. All in all, the food, cocktails, and beer are all great. I can't want to go back and try out the Punch House."
"I have eaten at Dusek's twice, both times early in the evening, and I loved both experiences. The food was as advertised on the menu, tasting as it should have tasted. The flavors were ""clean."" At the end of my second visit, the best thing that happened was that the front door hostess remembered my previous visit a week earlier and what I had eaten on that visit. This is the sort of service that you expect only from much more expensive restaurants."
"It's been awhile since I've written a review on Yelp, but my experience at Dusek's brought me back into the Yelp game.My friends and I are NEVER in Pilsen. Never. But we made a very special trip down there to try out this highly rated brunch place last Sunday. We knew that we were going to have to wait and we got there a little after noon we were told there would be a 45 minute wait for five people. Reasonable. In order to kill some time we went to the hole-in-the-wall bar across the street, Los Tres Dias. There were a lot of people waiting outside of Dusek's but no one was in this place. We had a beer at the bar with the 3 locals in there then shot back out in anticipation of us eating soon. I actually laughed out loud after writing that just now.It took us an hour and a half to get a table. At some point what I assume was the GM told us that we were their ""highest priority"". I'm sure. When we were led into the back room it was even more infuriating to see that half of the tables were empty. Eventually the waiter came over and took our drink order. We looked over the small menu and had our mind's made up when the waiter came back. Then we started ordering. Someone first ordered the eggs benedict and we were told that they were out. Not really sure how you run out of eggs benedict during Sunday brunch. It consists of 3 ingredients that pretty much no brunch restaurant should ever be able to run out of even if they wanted to. Then the bomb was dropped on us. Someone tried to exercise their choice of bacon or sausage option with the simple 2-egg breakfast that they were forced to get. Dusek's was out of sausage. Out. Of. Sausage. I mean really. You wanna piss me off? Tell me you're out of sausage.While we waited for our food to come, we realized how much trouble this place was in. There was one waiter for the entire room and he looked like a deer in headlights. The table behind us had their entire bill comped because one of the meals came out out 30 minutes later than the rest of the table's. Later we realized it a birthday brunch. Happy birthday from Dusek's! Later a food runner dropped an entire tray of food, but by that point it was almost expected. The GM was running from table to table apologizing for the brunch tragedy that was unfolding all around us.Eventually the food came but by that point all of us were just in shock. The food seemed alright but it was hard for us to tell as two of my friends were forced to get a simple 2-egg breakfast which even this place couldn't mess up even if they tried. I'm sure they must have been having a terrible day but it was a doozy. All of the glowing reviews this place gets on Yelp couldn't get me to go there again. It was an experience that was THAT bad. You know, one of those experiences where everyone is just talking about how bad the experience is the whole time as it's happening.The building it's in is nice though, so it's got that going for it."
"Wherever I've lived, I've always had a favorite go-to spot for a semi-fancy, mouth-watering, innovative , love-the-atmosphere, get-really-excited-an-hour-before-leaving-for-the-­restaurant type dinner. I've struggled to find a place in Chicago that gets me THAT excited. Don't get me wrong, I know there are good places everywhere, but I've not found a place that suits me that way here...until now.Dusek's! I'm in love with this place. I fully intend on being a regular here. I've been twice to this Pilsen hotspot recently. First, I was invited here on a second date. I must say, it's a perfect second date spot. Probably a bit much for date one, and everyone knows date three should involve a movie. I ordered the roast chicken which was served with a whipped squash, cranberry, exotic mushrooms and spinach. Oh! We both went on and on about this dish. It was incredibly moist, just perfect. It was big enough for me to have a large meal and for him to sample repeatedly. He ordered the Lobster Pot Pie which could have used more homemade crust...you know the kind that spills over the edges of the dish. I noticed on my second visit that this item was off the menu. Fear not, lobster was still represented. More on that later.After dinner, I recommend heading downstairs to the Punch Bowl. My date said it looked just like his grandma's basement. And I think that's the point. Low ceilings, vintage odds and ends and a secret door all make this a unique and wonderful place to sip drinks.They also play some groovy tunes at the Punchbowl. That night, they played what sounded like 60's brazilian lounge music. We ended up dancing. No one seemed to care. It made sense somehow. Fun fun.My second visit was just two weeks later with a group of pals. We attempted reservations since we were going on a Friday night. I was confused by the reservation policy as I was not clear if they take seatings at peak dinner hours or not (for parties of 5 of more). That aside, a group of 6 of us arrived at 6:45 to a 2-hour wait. Yikes! We ventured downstairs for some  tasty spicy punch drinks and were called by the hostess an hour later, thankfully.We started with a salt cod appetizer, oysters (east and west coast duked it out), crab dip and duck fat fries. Pleasant noises from all, very little talking...it was that good!Our waiter was patient, knowledgable and kind. I had this same experience on my first visit, top notch service! I will also mention that the music upstairs is fabulous, usually 80's tinged. I dig eating delectable food to the Psychedelic Furs and Depeche Mode. It works here!Our dinners consisted of:Lobster roll- huge chunks of perfect lobsterRoast chicken- yeah same as the first visit, I couldn't resistPrawns- oh man, what was in the heavenly smokey sauce?Pork Shank- regal!MoroccanTagine- not often does the vegetarian end up with one of best dishes in my opinion. The Tagine, it's More-Rawkin'. Forgive me...I know.They also offer a special they call the Ordinary. It's a featured dish plus a recommended beer pairing. The menu changes or should I say evolves. :-) There's so much more I could say about Dusek's.My pals are still talking about this place. We are all Longman & Eagle fans (same owners). I much prefer the food at Dusek's. I'll be back but likely on a weeknight when it's not such a scene, there's parking available and I don't have to wait too long for a table. Ah, I miss it already! I found my spot!"
"Passing through town, my Air B&B hosts metioned this as a posilbe dining spot in walking distance. It was the first one of their recommendations that I found so that's where I stayed. I dined alone at the bar. The bartender Andy, and his colleagues were attentive and knowledgeable. The mussels were fantastic but too much for one person who wanted to try other things so I gave half my order to the gals next to me at the bar. The shaved seasonal vegetable salad was on the bland side. A sprinkle of sea salt would have done it wonders. The General Tso's sweetbreads....holy shit...amazing. Thanks for a lovely evening in a really interesting neighborhood."
"Excellent brunch menu.  Gorgeous room.  The people who work there are very nice.  Good beer list, though the prices are all over the place.  Street parking is somewhat difficult.  Our only major problem was that their oyster shucker did a terrible job.  Lots of pieces of shell."
Great night out. Dinner; 4 small plates for 2 (could have done with three) all were excellent. Service very attentive. Quality of food superb. Drinks top notch. Highly recommend a bust.  Punch bar downstairs has great vibe and Canadian punch is wonderful. A must stop by our n Chicago. Expect will only get more and more popular.
"Great place for a group dinner. We called ahead for a table of 10 (1 month in advance) and got the table on the ""stage"". Nice little set up. Even with appetizers, entrees and several rounds of drinks it was inexpensive. Great beer selection and we were able to get into Punch House downstairs immediately after dinner."
"Pilsen isn't usually a neighborhood I frequent... not because I'm not a fan, just because I'm lazy.This is a very cool new spot.  Decidedly hipster and a sign of the gentrification taking over this neighborhood.My friend suggested it and I came with no idea what to expect.  The menu is inventive and the craft beers are plentiful.  When I found out it was by the guy from Longman & Eagle, it all made sense.The brandade fritters were delicious and well plated.  I had the juicy lucy, which wasn't super impressive.  I think it's more bad ordering than a reflection on the rest of the menu.Will definitely come back and try more offerings.  I'd say it could compete with any trendy West Loop/River North spot (think Maude's or Gilt bar) but with better pricing."
"So the owners of the baddest gastropub in town (Longman and Eagle) introduce Dusek's.So continues my mad obsessive love affair with anything Longman and Eagle..........Got there on a Sunday night when it wasn't too busy.  We sat at the bar for a while cos it's a cool hangout place.  This place is all about beer and I'm all about cocktails.  So my husband checked out the beer list and I checked out the rather small cocktail list.A Belgian Fashioned and Sharing the Feathered Crown initially kept us company.  Admittedly, neither the bar vibe or the drinks surpass Longman but a pretty nice place to chill nonetheless.I was curious about the basement bar Punch House but it was closed due to a private event.  Oh well.  Sounded like a justification for a return visit.While at the bar, we overheard someone raving about an imperial stout - Off Color Dinos' More.  I had a sip and there was definitely flavors of chocolate, vanilla, and yes........marshmallows.  I can't warm up to beer but my husband was in love.  Dinner started with wood roasted olives, and duck fat frites.  I knew I had to pace myself but just couldn't stop eating those duck fat fries; just melt in your mouth delicious.  We had another round of drinks and by the time the night was over, we had tried everything on the cocktail menu except the Dusek Warmer.  Next we decided to split the wood roasted panzanella and this is when the wow factor started to seriously kick in.  We dug our forks and polished off a mouth-watering concoction of romaine, olives, sourdough, fennel, and pickled onion.  At this point, this is looking like a solid four star place.   The star of the night however was yet to arrive.  At this point, we're struggling on what to order next.  Would it be the risotto, or the vegetable tagine?  i'm a huge fan of tartare but the table next to us ordered this and it was a rather small dish.  A hamburger fan, my husband was surely eying the Jucy Lucy.  I decide to text my fellow foodie who promptly recommended the Crispy Pork Shank.  We decided to give it a try.It arrived.......the amazing pork shank.  I really don't know where to begin.  It was crispy, juicy, with a tinge of sweetness from the maple gastrique with amazing cheddar hush puppies and oh so awesome greens.  Don't miss this dish.......you may be so full and you can't eat anymore but really don't miss the pork shank.By now I'm ranking this place at 4.5 stars.  We weren't done though.  I ordered the ginger cazuela cake and my husband had the seasonal ice cream sundae.  Can this dinner keep getting better?  Yup!The cazuela cake had a sweet potato custard, covered with pecan crumble, and topped by a sorbet and lemon creme fraiche.  I mixed it all up, dug in, and polished it off.  This was just a superb dessert with the ginger flavor providing a subtle kick.      Even the bathroom is worth discussion.  The wall in there is a chalkboard and ladies are encouraged to share their thoughts.  I was delighted to find a prominent note on the pork shank and promptly scribbled my thoughts on this superb dish.  A dish this good surely deserves a few scribbles on the wall.  This was so much fun; it felt like I was back in kindergarten except I could write whatever I wanted.The bathroom chalkboard sealed the deal!  My first visit and I'm giving this place 5 stars.  They only take reservations for large groups; I have a feeling it's going to be pretty tough to get into this place!!!!!"
Cool venue but there are like no vegetarian or vegan options. The omelette on the menu has dairy and they can't make a vegetarian omelette without dairy. The manager was nice enough to offer a salad or cinnamon roll for brunch. The salad is only greens and dressing. Could use some work on vegetarian options.
"Pros: GREAT food!, lots of space inside, cool interior, downstairs bar (punch house) makes life easierCons: none!"
"All around great experience at Dusek's. Love the vibe, very comfortable and cozy! The food is absolutely delicious and very reasonable prices for the amount of love that is put into the meal. Friendly staff and a great beer/cocktail selection. Only complaint would be that it's a hair loud, so it was difficult to hear my date talk. Overall though, way to go Dusek's!"
"Delicious food in an eclectic space. Had some neat menu choices, from Kentucky Fried Quail to a kraut and sausage plate (Choucroute) that could have fit in my grandma's kitchen if it weren't accompanied by duck confit and pickled apple. Cocktails are good, although if you're looking to drink, you'll probably want to go downstairs.If only they were closer transit. I would be here a bunch. Once Thalia Hall gets up and running, I might be there anyway."
"One of the best dining experiences I have ever had in Chicago. From the moment we sat down our server was spot on with both her beer and food recommendations.  If I had to suggest anything to try, it would be the entire menu including the desserts."
I rarely travel to Pilson as I'm a river north brat however I went to Dusek's with some girlfriends for a Sunday brunch.  To start off the ladies and I enjoyed some brunch cocktails.  Bloody marys and beermosas all around.  We next tried the pie-spiced beignet-the perfect fall treat!  For lunch I'd recommend the mac and cheese (delicious and a great appetizer to share) or the goat cheese omelet.  The only item I'd stay clear from is the farm green salad.  $7 for nothing but a plate of lettuce?  No thank you!
"Been here 2-3 times, food is well prepared and very tasty. Beer selection is outstanding. Service is always good(we eat at the bar) except for today-service really off. I trust it's just a fluke and he'll get it or get fired. Certainly not a reason to not give this place a go-it's great overall."
Excellent bar!  Sister location to Longman and eagle.  Worth the wait and the craft cocktails are spot on.
Brunch. Meh. Dinner. Meh. I only come for the punch house booze. Hence the high rating...
"duseks is great - reminded me of an infinitely more hipster bottlefork.Ambiance is cool, dark, menu is great. tons of inventive drinks, esp the gin and tonic which they shake up in a beer bottle before pouring. my favorite were the risotto, scallops, and prawns. but everything on the menu was superb. portions were pretty big, prices were reasonable also. service was very attentiveWould not recommend oysters - not great quality, and had pieces of shell with themchecked out punchbowl also - like an old basement, dark, and with a neighborhood feel. took a while to get our drinks, but maybe it's because we weren't wearing flannels, and i only have one tat, not a whole sleeve. little bit of attitude downstairs, but not upstairs.they also don't offer the punches upstairs either.def worth checking out again, next time i will put on my clear black rimmed glasses, beanie, and flaunt my tattoos. maybe grow a full beard too."
"Dusek's is by the same group that does Longman & Eagle, so I had fairly high expectations going in. It's a little of the beaten path in Pilsen, but the area is up and coming and there is something to be said for leading your party to a spot like this unassumingly tucked away on the near southwest side. I'm not sure what it used to be, but the building itself has a distinct charm and old Chicago feel to it. They don't take reservations for parties of less than five people. We put our names in and bellied up to the bar for 15 minutes before we were called. I will mention that the bar is very well-run and it has one of the more finely curated beer lists you can expect to see at a restaurant. Our server actually pointed out that the menu is designed for beer pairings. The ambiance is cozy, very dim lighting in the main dining area. We had a very knowledgeable and polite server and a supporting case of bus boys, kitchen runners etc, all equally as pleasant and attentive to us over the course of the meal. We had the duck wings for starters with a creamy buffalo sauce some type of in-house giardinara that was amazing. We then got a sampler ham board with selections from Virginia, Iowa and Speck from Italy, served alongside homemade sourdough toast with butter and mustard.The star of the show was the juicy loosey which was a decadent high-grade beef burger topped with bacon marmalade, served with duck fat fries. This alone would have been worth the trip. We did also have a greens dish with a mustard vinaigrette which was good, but overshadowed by our other dishes. I will definitely return and am interested in trying ""The Ordinary"" which is basically their blue plate special and beer pairing selected by the chef."
"Ah, Pilsen.  The new hipster mecca, and it was only a matter of time before something like Dusek's popped up.  A couple of friends treated us to dinner one night, and everything was really great.  The mussels were especially good - rubbed with smoked paprika and something spicy, they were served dry on an iron platter instead of in some sort of broth.  It was a different preparation, which is always cool.Everything we had was really good (I especially liked the risotto), and the cocktail and wine list was reasonably priced and full of good stuff.  [our dining companions went back a couple weeks later for brunch and said they would stick with dinner, for what it's worth.]After dinner, we got the tour of the upcoming Thalia Hall from a friend of ours.  Mark my words, that is going to be the new place to see a show.  It is going to be VERY cool when the rehab is done!"
"Party of four - we were all disappointed. I choose to believe it was just an 'off night'. Went on a Monday to avoid the crowds. Loads of open tables. Scallop - delicious (worthy of the hype)Crab dip - way too fishy (we discussed whether it was close to spoiled)Lobster Roll - good, but nothing specialDuck Breast dish - potential, but not even warm. And the veg was way undercooked.Juicy Lucy burger - nothing specialChoucroute - again, nothing special and super heavy (but expected that)Service was above average. Not worthy of a trip back for me. Sorry."
"You wouldn't think one of the best breakfasts of your life could be something as simple as bacon, eggs, toast, and potatoes, but Dusek's knocks it out of the park. I dearly love Nana, but the southside now has a new competitor for best brunch. Service is always attentive and friendly, the location is beautiful, I don't have enough good things to say about this place. So good."
"Came for drinks downstairs. Really cool atmosphere, 70's/60's I'd say. Downstairs is self setting FYI. We got some cocktails, tea and the churros For dessert. The churro was awesome: chocolate and spicy twist with it, highly recommended it for dessert. Very pleased with everything, friendly service. Definitely coming back for dinner- I heard the dinner was amazing."
"I finally made it here! It was a Friday, and super busy. Instead of standing around in the Punch House downstairs, we grabbed a few seats by the entrance for table service at Dusek's. It was a little loud, and the server came by very rarely, but the drinks were good. I'd probably only go back on weekday when I can enjoy the atmosphere and food (and hopefully faster service.)The atmosphere and decor is very chic. Food was ok (from what my friends said). I'd recommend a weekday visit to give the food, drinks, and atmosphere a good chance."
"Fantastic in every way.Service = friendly, professional but not pushy. You can tell that the entire staff communicates with each other and that Kitchen and FOH are working as a team (gasp!)Food = perfect and I don't use that word lightly. Interesting but for all the right reasons. At some restaurants, foie cornbread would come across as trying too hard or, as Moe from The Simpsons would say ""weird for the sake of being weird"". At Dusek's, however, it's perfectly executed and, now, I can't imagine eating fried quail with anything else.  This is the perfect place to bring a group of friends - everyone from your ""I have season tickets to Next"" foodie friend to your ""Swiss cheese on a burger? Faaaaancy!"" friend will feel at home. Value - portions are huge. Keep this in mind when you order. Order a few dishes and share and then order another round if you are still hungry. One of the absolute best values in Chicago.  Drinks - beer selection is incredible and very reasonably priced. Beer is served in the correct type of glass (gasp!). Staff is extremely knowledgable  and eager to make recommendations based on your preferences. Ask to try a sample if you aren't sure you are ready to invest in 16 ounces of a Yuzu beer (fantastic, by the way!)Tips:1) The menu is organized from ""light"" to ""heavy"" in each section. When sharing multiple dishes, start with items at the top of each section and move to ""heavier/larger"" items. 2) Even though the menu is rather meat focused, there are great vegetarian options (tagine is incredible and very satisfying even for a meat eater)3) While waiting for your table, head downstairs to Punch House (see my separate review).4) get the Juicy Lucy and duck fat fries.  Just go and get it."
"Awesome atmosphere huge spot. Downstairs bar is cool. I ate upstairs in the dining room. I had a handful of dishes but my standout picks were the sweet breads, and the octopus confit. If you consider yourself a foodie, this is a must!"
"Dusek's is easily my favorite find of the last 12 months.We were attending an event at Punch House downstairs and decided to come for dinner to kill time beforehand. Parking in the area was super easy on a Sunday night (and free!). The space is great--hipster, but not pretentious...just reads like it was put together by that one friend who has a great eye for decorating (but maybe likes Animal Collective a little too much). First thing I noticed while looking at their menu is that the draft list is really and truly SUPERB. None of that ""we're a craft beer bar because we have every predictable Goose Island and Bell's tap available"" BS.  They had a few familiar favorites, but also some Evil Twin on draft, which I see rarely (if ever) in this area. Sold!My husband and I ended up ordering two starters and two entrees, which was perfect. One thing to note is that they seem to have changed their menu recently, so many items that are mentioned in reviews from a few months ago are no longer available. We ordered:Stuffed pretzel: what is it stuffed with? A delicious, creamy cheese sauce. I want to come here again just to order this and drink a few beers at the bar. Yes please!Duck fat fries: very solid. Romesco sauce was tasty and unexpected, but I did miss the usual garlic aioli here.Fried quail: O.M.G. Everything about this was wonderful. Foie gras cornbread, red beans, country gravy..yep yep yep.Cobia collar (special for the day): I did not try because of my shellfish allergy but my husband enjoyed.Service was overall very good--our server was very sweet and knowledgable and gave us samples of beer she thought we might like, which was great. However, if I was tempted to take off a point it would be here, only because service was SLOW. Dinner took two hours with us being pretty decisive about what we wanted. We had two hours to kill so it wasn't an issue, but I would not come here expecting to be in and out.Cannot wait to go back--I'll just do so with realistic expectations about how much time it will take, which is fine....two hours at Dusek's sounds great about anyways."
Their brunch menu is awesome.  The neighborhood needs a place like this.
"Went in with 3 people on a Tuesday night at 7 PM and there was NO WAIT! Super easy to get to from the loop via bus and a quick uber ride home.  We started with the charcuterie plate (served with homemade sourdough bread) and pumpkin risotto, both hearty portions and the perfect balance to start with of salty and sweet.  Also split the special, the cassoulet.  Found it to be a little salty but overall great flavors.  Don't forget to try the cookie dough dessert - unique mix of unexpected and the caramel is AMAZING.  Definitely want to go back and had great service and overall experience at Dusek's!"
"Good food, but mediocre service. Put ourselves on the 40 min wait list. The host staff wouldn't seat us until we closed out at the bar, which is normal, unless the process takes over 15 mins.Ordered the 1/2 dozen set of oysters for $15, only to be charged $19. I asked if I could order the half dozen and listed which types I wanted. Yet, our waiter never mentioned that the $15 price tag meant chef's choice. Would have been nice especially since I was pointing to that option. A simple clarification would have avoided the ""I feel glad handed"" feeling when I got the check. Ordered the Prix Fixe. Their mussels were good, but would have enjoyed a broth. The flavors were well developed. The Porchetta was the highlight of the night. It was perfectly juxtaposed with the cooked apples and polenta. The chilli churros with chocolate sorbet was good, but not that impressive.Overall, I'd say it's worth the try, but the service just killed it for me. Our waiter was attentive, but definitely did not know what he was doing. Host staff seemed to not care, and bar staff was right there with not delivering the experience necessary for a good Chicago restaurant."
"At first they made us go downstairs to Punch Town, and we were all, ""oh nuts, we can't do seks,"" but then they said we could go back up and eat there. Totes Duseksual. Would be at least 5 stars if the seat in the men's stall could stay upright on its own merit, or if they gave us more churros. Bartender accommodated a flower power martini."
"Came here on a Tuesday night, for a Tuesday it was pretty packed.  Came for dinner, since it was in the neighborhood and everyone was talking about it.  Overall, okay.  I mean it was okay but not the best I've ever had.  I would say the most stars go for the decor, I love the look of dark wood, hardwood floors, open spaces.  It really is perfect.I ordered the burger and I'm not a rare meat eater, there I said it, but I was assured my meat would be cooked through even if I couldn't get it done well because of the cheese in the meat.  Okay I said fine, let's go for it.  What I got was REALLY RED, ew I couldn't eat it. no matter how many people try to make me eat rare, it's just not for me, so I ended up eating the edges of my burger that were cooked through.  From the bites, I ate, it wasn't bad.  The fries were fantastic!  My bf ordered the burger too and he loves his meat still breathing so he loved the burger.  He actually ate most of mine too.We also ordered the fried green beans in the sauce.  While good initially, after 15 minutes they were pretty soggy and mushy.  The dessert was good!  We got a chocolate concoction of deliciousness!  We shared it and it was great. Service was good, our waiter was attentive, nice."
"The environment was nice, but all I wanted was a quick bite before the show at Thalia Hall. I didn't expect to pay $40 dollars for a sub par 5 oz cocktail ($9) and a small steak (The tendon with wasabi powder?), 2 split Brussel sprouts, and a couple of small random pieces of potatoes. It didn't taste bad, but for a portion so small I'd of expected the ration of price to flavor at least make it worthwhile. Ive had better food for less. I don't mind splurging for a tasty meal; this wasn't it. I left hungry to say the least. Wouldn't come here again."
"I was ready to hate Dusek's after all the hype, but it lived up to its reputation. Everyone loved their good and the beer pairings were on point. Now that we're living in Pilsen, we'll be stopping by more often."
"Cocktails were awesome, specifically the beermosas. The service was ok, but the server didn't know the menu well enough to accommodate a dairy allergy, so she kept having to run back to the kitchen. In general, there weren't a lot of dairy free options. The portions were also surprisingly small for the price."
"Came with two friends. Such friendly and knowledgeable staff, delicious food and the punch?! Amazing. We went upstairs and downstairs (limited menu downstairs but still very workable as the Tuesday night crowd proved). Definitely recommend this pilsen spot for the drinks (we had a carafe of Punch #2 and it was magnificent, in a word). My friends had the lobster dip, I had the Juicy Lucy. Well made burger, no issue with any aspect. Good decor, dark, a bit romantic for friends but the music was quieter so we still could talk and have a good time. If you're in the south loop, Pilsen, Bridgeport, I recommend coming through. Oh! And $5 punch on Mondays :-)"
"We happened here on a Monday night after a few recommendations from folks and were not disappointed.The atmosphere was incredibly chill and diverse, great for us 30 and 40 something's. We started with the farm greens salad and roasted olives and finished them both off.  The scallops and and prawns were very well appointed and had unique flavor combinations. I particularly enjoyed the gnocchi that came with they scallops. We will definitely return and visit the lounge downstairs."
We came here using the ALA Card discount and found that the food was good but not great and the waiter we had was a little pushy.  I'm vegetarian so the Vegetable Tagine was good and flavorful but a little dry for my taste and a bit expensive.  It is a great location because of the Punch Bowl drink place downstairs and the Theater upstairs.
"Service is great and the food is amazing however, a little spendy for the smaller portions.  I would def order many items to share.  Great beers on tap and unique cocktails too!"
"We ate dinner here last night - it was a Saturday evening at 6:15pm and we we're seated quickly without reservations. Our waiter Simon was great! Very attentive and we wish we would've ordered all his suggestions. We ordered mussels, an heirloom tomato salad, the porchetta, and the juicy lucy. The waiter suggested the mussels and the porchetta and they were fantastic. The salad was not good - I was expecting great tasting heirloom tomatoes but they tasted like plain over-ripe mushy tomatoes.  For $12 bucks I expected more than a couple slices of watermelon and 3 skimpy slices of an 'heirloom' tomato.  The burger was average at best. The burger at Three Aces in University Village is a million times better and cost a couple of bucks less - whoever is in charge should try the burger at Three Aces so they can taste what a great 'gastro' burger should be."
"This place gets worse and more pretentious each time I go. I feel like the portion sizes have gotten smaller and the plating more ridiculous. Nothing wrong in priniciple with that kind of cuisine, but in this case the quality just isn't there to back up such a ridiculous display. It completely felt as if they were trying to cut costs with the food. I've worked in a restaurant before and I know what that looks like... Not a great feeling to have as a customer. Everything tasted fine, but the meals were incomplete and we left hungry.However, the service has improved (bar the doorman...) and the beer selection is great and not way overpriced as at simliar restaurants. They ought to apply the same phillosophy on their beer list (good descriptions, abs, volume, and price) to the rest of the menu and provide calorie counts.Currently, this place is a joke. I don't plan to go back."
"My husband and I went here for NYE and we are glad we did! Instead of the usual wine pairing, we had a beer pairing we our 5 course meal which I thought was interesting as we both love our beer!As soon as you enter you realise that it has a similar vibe to Longman & Eagle. There is a big bar to the left at which people were sitting and having their meals as well as tables on the right. There are 2 main halls, we were escorted to the second one that had a beautiful brick oven blazing and a very homey feel to it. The second hall was louder than the first too as there were bigger groups seated there.Every single dish of the 5 course meal was delicious. I enjoyed tasting the various types of beer as well though I am not sure how the pairing worked with the food- I guess I have never done a beer pairing before so I couldn't judge whether it went with the food or not.My favorite dish was their first course: Seared Scallops (with butternut squash risotto, soy caramel chestnut, asian pear relish)- the ingredients went so well together and the scallops were cooked to perfection. The dessert was unexpectedly delicious as well - champagne tapioca granita, blood orange pound cake, blood orange puree. I wish the servers had explained their dishes a little more when they served us though I guess they had a lot going on because of NYE. I would certainly go here again, it had that old charm and tasty palette that I'm always looking for! The music doesn't disappoint either, they were playing the music from the punch house - tunes probably a lot of us grew up with in college so there were more than a few humming along to the tunes!"
"Anytime the owners of Longman and Eagle open a new restaurant, I'm game. Duseks was no exception. I love that it took me to a neighborhood that I don't frequent very often to such a lovely and historic building. My husband and I went on a Sunday night around 8:00 and had about a 20 minute wait. We sat at the bar and he got a beer and I got a cocktail and we shared the duck fat fries. The drinks were delicious, but unfortunately, the fries were a little underwhelming. We were excited about the fries because they were served with romesco, but the romesco was super bland. It left me wanting some aioli. And it also made me regret that we didn't get the green beans. We asked the bartender what he recommended as something quick and he didn't really offer up much. Once we got to our table, we saw that there was a ""bar menu."" with a blue crab dip and other awesome small plates that we would have loved to have tried. Cest la vie. We ordered dinner - I got the crispy pork shank and my husband got the hake. Both were delicious. The pork was in a really rich and unctious dark sauce and it came with roasted veggies and collard greens. The fish was in a dish of chowder. I just wish I could have licked the bowl!We skipped dessert because we were so full. Their warm cocktail with bourbon is something that I would highly recommend as well! We will definitely be going back..."
We went to the punch house tonight about 9pm and a bunch of Hispanics came and they decided to throw bottles at white girls for no reason. No control by the bar but seems about right for pilsen neighborhood. Don't go if you are not used to that
"Believe the hype - the food was all delicious! S and I went on a Friday night at 9:15pm thinking the wait should be less and it was an hour long wait at that time.  The service could definitely be friendlier (introduce yourself and say I'll be your server tonight, smile, tell me a bit about the concept of the place or mention any specials, ask me if i have any questions about the menu, etc.) but she did what I would expect a server to do - take our order and bring out delicious dishes in an appropriate amount of time.I started with some raw oysters, which were good considering we're in Chicago since I've definitely had worse at seafood based establishments. S and I split the pretzel. GET THIS!  The dough is a bit different (more layered rather than the texture of bread?) but in a good way. I'm not a fan of pretzels in general but I would get this again. But beware, the mustard that came with it will wake up your sinuses - dip responsibly. For our entrées, S and I split the quail and the mackeral dish.  The quail was sophisticated comfort food. Cornbread was moist and full of flavor, the red beans were a surprise but contributed to the dish, and I could eat a whole jar of the picked okra that came on the dish.  I don't normally see mackeral on menus, except in Japanese restaurants, so I definitely wanted to try it. Mackerel is a very flavorful white fish and Duskek's seared the skin perfectly. Beautifully seasoned and paired with sweet potato gnocchi (amazingly fluffy and the best that I can remember eating), mushrooms and pickled yellow beets. One of my favorite dishes I have eaten in a LONG time.I was definitely impressed by the food here. Be ready for the long wait times but its worth it."
Food and drinks are excellent! Mussels and crab dip should be mandatory. Both are unlike any other I've had. Try the ordinarys if your looking for something new. Also have great burger and any meat and potato dish will not disappoint. Service is great. And punch house as awsome for before or after just be warned that punch can sneak up on you!
"So I liked Dusek's. Would probably prefer a 3.5 rating, but I'll round up. The Ordinary, a lamb osso bucco was good but was really way too salty. My boyfriend has had osso bucco many a time and has always raved, so I was excited to try this but was definitely underwhelmed. The blue crab dip was yummy, as others have mentioned. The pig tail dish, a sort of eggroll, was okay. Not bad but not particularly anything to write home about. The dessert, a ginger cazuela cake was phenomenal. The drink selection is great. The service was very good. I loved the decor, though our two-top was a bit cramped and a bit close to our neighboring diners. All-in-all, I would probably go back if someone wanted me to, but I don't think I'd decide to go back on my own (unless we're talking drinks and dessert). Worth a shot checking this place out. Your meal may be way better than mine."
"One would not necessarily expect excellent seafood in land locked Pilsen, but in this brave new restaurant renaissance I've come to expect the unexpected, and I was not disappointed by my first visit to the latest outpost of the Longman and Eagle crew, the modern day Midases of the restaurant world.The building itself is gorgeous, and the insides have been lovingly restored, with I believe the original bar, floor, ceilings and light fixtures intact.  It is an inviting vintage space, and the front of the restaurant has ample room to sit or stand and wait for a table when the inevitable wait begins to queue.  Fortunately for us, we arrived relatively early on a Saturday night and had to wait only 5 to 10 minutes.While Dusek's presents itself as a beer and food pairing restaurant, you are not limited to beer if it isn't your primary preference.  Their cocktails are excellent and my noble bourbon boozers will be relieved to hear that the bar mixes a spicy and well balanced rye Manhattan.For us, we were going whole hog (haddock?) on the seafood side of the menu, so rather than select beer we ordered a bottle of the menu's sole rose.  While I always prefer the opportunity of choice when I order rose, if the rose is right one is all you need, and at Dusek's, that is the case.  It was, as I recall, from the South of France, where all rose conversations begin and end, so we were not disappointed.The three of us ordered, among other things, the seafood tower for two, the BBQ prawns and grits, the crab cakes, and the green beans and bacon.  All were excellent, but I must call out the prawns as being stupendous - prawns, if you have not had them, have a milky flavor which sets them a step above mere shrimp, and combined with the tang of the BBQ sauce and the creamy grits makes for a head spinning dish.  The seafood platter could have used a bit more seafood for my taste (but I'm greedy), but what was there, including 1/2 a lobster, was delicious and fresh.  The green beans and bacon were savory and rounded out our meal.  Washed down with the bottle of rose, even our server and the host were jealous!Oh, save room for dessert, they are very good, particularly the chocolate bar.  There is one dessert, I think it is the parfait, if memory serves me, which is to be avoided - it simply tries too much - but you'll recognize it when you read it.  It is served in a jar.  Never trust a dessert in a jar.  Stick with chocolate and you can't go wrong.Service here was very good, if a bit hectic because we were there the second weekend it opened.  However they were aware of some delays, and apologetic.  It was no skin off our backs, for we were here for the duration.  We were only sad that, by the time we were finished, Punch House was packed and so our punch drunk phase of the evening would have to wait for another day.But we will be back; this is a great spot to become a regular if you are local, and worth a trip if you live in parts north."
"We've been for brunch twice, and while it was hit and miss each time, the food was reliably very good. The first time, the food was good, but it was served cold. In addition, we waited fifteen minutes before asking a hostess if we had a server, and then he was absent whenever we would need anything.The second time was a different story. We went with a large group (Dusek's takes  reservations for larger groups) and the service more or less never missed a beat. Moreover, the food was some of the best we've had for brunch -- it was clear that someone put a lot of time and thought into these dishes. Try the beignets for sure, and I've had the oyster hash twice. Also, get a side order of whatever grits they're serving; these aren't the menu, but they're some of the best we've had.We think/hope our first experience was a one-off, and we definitely recommend giving it a try."
I'm always in pilsen trying out different places but I always skip this place. Tried it three times it was OK. Everything is super over priced. Me and my friends ordered a punch bowl the waitress brought it out and it was halfway filled. The punch isn't very good. The food is decent! Just not my cup of tea I guess!
Great service with friendly staff. Awesome neighborhood. Everything we ordered was excellent excerpt the octopus who was surprisingly brand. Burger and sweetbreads were excellent. Will come back.
One of the most delicious meals I've had in Chicago! Don't sleep on the Cookie Dough and Soft Shell Crab Sandwich. The pretzel and cheese plate were also pretty good. Husband enjoyed his catfish. Beer selection is great and the space is gorgeous.
I met Meyer over there! Its for sure a nice place for a date or group of friends wants to get together. Food was good too but I didn't like drinks so much
holy fuggenfantastic brunch. Flawless. Nice job - be back for dinner soon.
"I dined here on Friday, 8/30/2014, with my husband. If ever there were an establish that takes negative reviews to heart, this is it! Despite the crowds, we were thoughtfully and respectfully blanketed with extraordinary service from the moment we were seated by at least four people (server, food carriers, section leader & busser). The menu was ambitious and pulled off extraordinary blends of distinct, fresh flavor combinations superbly. All in a beautiful, historic setting. A real gem!"
"This place is going to be the best thing that Pilsen has ever seen! Although you may not have heard your friends asking if you wanted to hang out in Pilsen before, you will definitely be stopping here to grab some amazing food or 1 of the 24 beers on tap... if you know what's good for you.The food here is so good I'm not sure if I could pick just one favorite. For a Mediterranean food lover like myself, the MOROCCAN SPICED VEGETABLE TAGINE IS OUT OF THIS WORLD! Or try the delicious BONELESS DUCK WINGS with aerated ranch and just a bit of spiciness.  For desert, the FRIED STOUT is the way to go!One of the coolest portions of the menu is ""The Ordinary"" which changes every week and always tastes extraordinary. The meal is served with a beer pairing (and they bring you a little extra once you're halfway done with your drink). The staff here is unbelievably nice. They know their menu and are always ready to offer advice or assistance if you need anything. Between the service, the food and the atmosphere, this place will be a hit. Although I live in the burbs, I know I'll be a regular already!"
"Awesome brunch! One of my favorites and I'll definitely be back.  I went with the poached eggs with the ham hock on rye.  So good.  The accompanying potatoes were really good as well. The cinnamon roll we split would have been better if it were warm but it was tasty all the same.  Finally I loved the coffee!! Seriously, I would have had to jog home beside the care if I had another cup but it was tasty enough that I gave it thought. While I just take it black  the sugar ""cubes"" provided were a cool touch that shows attention to detail, IMO."
"I rarely pray, but when I do, I ask for this! I have been waiting for YOU! Welcome to the neighborhood and I hope you never leave. I absolutely despise gin and tonics and this place makes the best gin and tonic I have ever had. The food is exceptional and they made me the best vegan food I have had in awhile. My little sister had the wood roasted steak and she devoured the whole plate. My mom ate so many oysters, I thought she was going to turn into one herself. I wish I knew our waiters name because he was terrific. I can't wait to go back."
"Came here for a late night bite to eat. .. the mussels were awesome, not usually a dish I order in a restaurant,  but it was great with paprika. ... the hangar streak was AWESOME... the green salad could of used a few veggies,  but I'm not going to get hung up on that...very nice beer selection. .. service was average, nothing special. ."
"holy holy goodness, I was in love with the decor when I walked in.  the most warmly lit, well spaced and just plain AWESOME space you have ever seen, the pictures do NOT do it justice at all.  I came in with six friends on a Friday night, early for our reservations, and was seated right away.We ordered the monkfish, the ordinary, and the choucroute.  I ordered the monkfish, and it  looked just alright at first, sitting on this soft pillowy bed of corn chowder....but MAN the taste was incredible.  The corn chowder tasted simultaneously creamy and so much like....corn at the same time...and the light creaminess perfectly complimented the fish.  awesome!  My friends had the ordinary, juicy lucy, and the choucroute, all of which were pretty good.If anything, i would say my only gripe about our meal that night was the portion sizes.  The fish was a pretty small portion, and while okay for me, would definitely not be enough for most men.  Same with the Ordinary, which that night was some type of fish I believe.  On the other hand, the choucroute came out as a HUGE platter, with pretty much nothing but different types of meat on there.  Totally perfect for a guy, although a bit salty.  If I came back again, I would be unsure of whether or not my dinner would make me ridiculously full, or not full enough.  major prob, Duseks. Punch House ended up being too crowded after dinner for us to hang out, but I love that we're able to bring drinks up from downstairs to enjoy during dinner.  We had the Dusek punch, which was a bit strong for my taste, but very good."
This beer inspired restaurant inspired my husband and I to celebrate our 20th anniversary. What a great choice. Hands down the best grilled octopus I've ever eaten! Great food; EXCEPTIONAL service and to top it off chocolate sourdough pudding. My husband took my tastebuds out dancing tonight!
"I was super impressed by Dusek's. You start with a fantastic rotating beer menu of local favorites as well as craft beers from around the world. I went with a barrel aged version of Chicago's own Off Color Brewing. Pro-tip, they have a couple flights you can try, but all beers are also available by the half glass as well (not marked on the menu) so if you're having trouble deciding on what to order (and with 24 options who would blame you?) be indecisive and try lots of things. For food, I shared the cheese stuffed pretzel, the broccollini and the skate wing. The pretzel was great but ended up being my least favorite dish. I cannot say enough positive things about the skate wing. Perfectly cooked, it was accompanied by roasted carrots, truffle risotto, and a lemon sauce. Everything about this was wonderful, one of the best dishes I've had anywhere. Beautifully plated and a generous serving. The malted English pudding dessert combined many delicious elements that kept me going back for a bite of this and a taste of that. I loved Dusek's, walked out of here wondering when the next time I could come back would be."
"I'll repeat the glowing reviews--ate here on Monday for hub's birthday and we loved it.  Space is lovely, warm.  Service was attentive and friendly.  Food was top-notch.  We ordered oysters (1/2 dozen, chef's choice - we asked for kumamoto and our server recommended we do the chef's choice and she'd make sure we got them, without the upcharge.  we got 4.  And they were awesome.  And we were super appreciative!)Bouillabaisse--probably the best we've ever had. Incredible.  Mmm, that sauce!Broccolini--as a girl who hates cooked broccoli?  I loved this. Pork Shank--meh. The only dish neither of us cared for.  Pork was dry, veggies were salty and the sour kale isn't my thing. Couldn't figure out how these flavors worked together.  I wouldn't order it again. Bread pudding (husband ordered this for desert and they brought it out with a candle).  Not much of a desert girl, but man this was good!!We left happy, and hubby had a great birthday dinner.  Mission accomplished!  :)"
"Thalia Hall is such a gorgeous building. They did a great job staying true to the structure. Wonderfully open and slightly ecclectic hipster feel. The staff were friendly and insanely knowledgeable. The water glass was never empty. They were almost TOO attentive, but it was the Thurs night after they opened, so I'm sure they were just overly prepared. The food was awesome and veerrrry reasonably priced. They clearly understand their market :-) lol. I went with the intention of a drink only, until I saw the prices. Then I ate. Phew! We had the Mussels, a Juicy Lucy Burger and a Cheese Stuffed pretzel. All fantastic. Oh, and the duck fat fries? I die!!!!I give 4 instead of 5 stars for the smell. Yes, the smell. They wood fire the fish in the dining room. It's neat to look at, it's a fun concept, but not fish. Anything but fish. It's one of those foods that tastes amazing but smells like an alley. The dining area smelled like the Chesapeake Bay off and on, and while I love seafood, that was not a fun smell to be combating my meal. My girlfriend had Gin and Tonic and was impressed with the beer menu. Usually she's tried all or most of a restaurant's selection, so she was excited to see a list if beers she hadn't tried yet."
"The girlfriend and I decided to stop by last night since we wanted to go somewhere outside of our usual neighborhoods.  We had a lot of fun!Overall, the food was really good.  We split a stuffed pretzel and the black and white risotto to start.  The risotto was my favorite dish of the night, it had a lot of interesting textures and tasted excellent.  The stuffed pretzel was also quite tasty.  For entrees, my girlfriend had the kentucky fried quail and I had the pork shank.  Her dish was excellent; the quail was delicious and the cornbread was one of the surprising highlights.  I liked my pork shank, especially the crispy skin, and the hush puppies were nice, but I didn't like other the sides that came with it (the hash was too salty and the greens were meh).  We split the chocolate bar for dessert...although, my girlfriend kept giving me dirty looks when I reached my fork in for a bite.  Preeeeeeetty sure that was her favorite dish of the night.As for everything else, the beer selection was phenomenal and the cocktail list looked interesting.  I liked the space, although it got a bit loud and cramped at times.  It was a warm and really well done place.I'd love to come back in the summer, especially with a larger group in order to snag a reservation and avoid the long waits."
"Wait staff was very friendly. Food sounded interesting, but needs improvement across the board. I'm not from Chicago, but have visited many gastropubs in the area. The food at this place was sub-par, at best. Pros: service, butter toast, cocktails, oystersCons: pickles (I make better at home), pork cheek (super fatty), beef fat fries (horrible)"
"my friend said I made the ""o"" face while eating here.so yea. We had the boneless duck wings, the juicy lucy, the ordinary which was duck breast with pumpkin risotto, and the jello panna cotta dessert? All were amazing. I didn't realize that the juiciy lucy was kinda like a burger, so that made sharing it cumbersome, but it was still good anyway. The highlight was the ordinary. The beer paring complimented it perfectly. The meat was also cooked perfectly. It was just a great dish in general, and I wish it would be on the regular menu. The duck wings were good, but not on the same level as everything else. Portion was kinda small for sharing too, but still, it was a good dish. Our bill came out to be around $35 after tax and 20%ish tip which was very reasonable for that meal. Come check it out before it get famous. You won't regret it!"
"I created an account just so I could write a review of Dusek's (and Punch House), yay! The food is phenomenal, the drinks are unique and delicious, the staff is warm and welcoming...you really couldn't ask for a better dining experience in the city. You can tell that everyone that works here has worked very hard to create a special environment; they know the menu really well and seem genuinely excited to share their enthusiasm!Punch House is the best black hole you will ever get sucked in. You should treat yourself and go down here if you want to spend some quality time with a group of friends, impress your date, or just stare at some silly fish for an hour. There's also a special treat at the bar at midnight down there that you'll just have to be there to experience for yourself ;)I've had an amazing experience every time I've been here and I know you will too!"
Great drinks and exceptional service. Food was just average and overpriced for being just average. Might try again to see if food is better the next time.
"This place is destined for hundreds of reviews, so I'm happy to be in the top, err first, 20.Impecable room, incredible service, amazing menu, fantastic beers. Did I miss anything? yeah: unexpectedly, the music they play is great. Walked in to the Dead Kennedys, walked out to the Dils. What restaurant plays the Dils? Who would have guessed anyone knew how much I love that one tune from the Dils? Apparently, this place does. Morrissey and the Oblivians were somewhere in the middle, and a host of other great songs. I can't believe I'm writing a review about Dusek's and mainly talking about the music.It's things like that, an attention to what makes a place great, that gives it 5 stars in my book. This is a place I'd like to eat at every day. You already know what to expect: L&E chef = local farms, seasonal ingredients, a bit of the unexpected done in a hearty, flavorful fashion. The beer menu was a highlight, one of the first things you see as you walk in. Lots of unexpected beers, which tells me they thought about it. Server will guide you with pairings if that's your thing.Of course we went downstairs for punch afterwards... and looking forward to going upstairs for music. A bit more than the budget allows for frequent visits, no matter how much I wish I could eat here all the time. But I'll be back on payday."
Good music. Great risotto. good drinks. $18 for subpar softshell crab sandwich. Slow service. Took 20min. For our raw oysters and 40minutes for a sandwich and mussels.
"I really really wanted to like this place more.After looking at a lot of places last visit, I decided to host my work happy hour here.I made a reservation online on the same day for 5 people at 530, which was great: they called to confirm at around 330. Two friends and I got there first and had a seat at the bar. I loved the ambiance, with the lighting and the decor. Street parking was easy to find; always a plus. The bartenders were really nice, I loved those guys! My cocktail was pretty good, but I wouldn't order it again (something with ginger beer?). They recommended a beer to me, wittikier? Sp?, which was exactly what I wanted from a beer! (I asked for something like a blue moon except lighter. They nailed it). We moved to our reserved table, and by this time the whole restaurant was very busy. We ordered the duck frites and the stuffed pretzel as an appetizer. The stuffed pretzel was amazing! I should have just gotten three of these for my dinner and called it a day. The duck frites were very very average tasting fries. My friend and I split the venesin tartare and the Maine lobster roll for dinner. The venesin tartare was TINY- I mean TINY for the price, and I get tartare frequently. Also the taste was off putting and almost tasted a bit spoiled. The tiny serving came with two huge pieces of untoasted regular French bread, which did not compliment the venison AT ALL. Very disappointed with this dish. The Maine lobster roll was a bit better. The portion size was great. The bread was warm, buttery, and quite delicious. There was no wow factor with the lobster roll however- there was a decent amount of lobster, but nothing fantastic about the flavor of the roll itself. And it came with duck frites, so had We known that, I would have held off on ordering the appetizer fries. My coworkers were unimpressed with their entrees as well. So, in summary, come for the atmosphere and drinks. Food was disappointing."
"Just a bit confused by the decor...bookshelves everywhere. I think they were going for mod but kinda got trapped at old. For the food...the shrimp & grits...yummy! Drinks...interesting....strong but needs better presentation. Bavettes is still leading the way for me in the drink dept. Downstairs is called Punch House but the punches were not that great! I'm a bit of an ice snob so I would prefer bigger ice cubes and since punch is the theme, there should be some great options...presentation...but not so much. Plus is that the kitchen stays open til 1a so this place is perfect for a late nite bite."
Waitress was very nice and kewl and she wasn't a full hipster which is nice.  Hipsters staff makes me assume the kitchen is filthy.  Juicy Lucy was very good.    It definitely lived up to the name I had juice running down to my elbows.  Only complaint is the first two bites are amazing.  Then all the cheese oozes out and it becomes a hamburger.  Also the duck fat fries I got must have been the end of a batch cause they were all small and I had to eat them with a fork like a gentleman....which I am not.That is all I have to say about that
"For the most part, the food we ordered at Dusek's was really delicious. I did not care for the cookie-dough dessert, which was way too sweet. The neighborhood feels very unsafe and after a quick walk around the block I decided to spend my 1hr wait inside near the bar. I loved the house gin and tonics. They make their own tonic water and the drink was so good after I finished it I immediately ordered a second."
"Amazing. We had the mussels, the risotto, the czech flight (with that delicious sour beer and becherovka), and the oysters. The food, the service, the ambiance, the music, the beer, the decor - everything was perfect."
"So I'm in the industry and I NEVER, I mean seriously never post on yelp, but with Dusek's it feels very warranted. I absolutely LOVE this place! The food is spot on every time and the atmosphere is super chill and comfortable. I'm a beer nerd and the beer selection is stellar. I live 30 seconds away from here which is a huge plus, and in the at least 15 times I've been here, I've never once had a bad experience. Longman is great but Dusek's is at a whole other level. You guys have my heart (and my stomach, which is ultimately the same thing), keep up the good work."
"Having been to L&E, I was not at all impressed that this place blew me away but it did!  I love the decor.  The place is charming but modern.  There are a bunch of shelves around with homey decorations as though you're in someone's living room.  Our server, Jonathan, was outstanding.  He was great with beer and wine recommendations as well as knows the menu very well.  He seemed genuinely happy to be there.  As L&E is known for their bourbon, Duseks is known for their beer, and  you'll find a LOT of it!  The wine list is not nearly as impressive but a Gruner by the glass sealed the deal for me.  We got only one item from the bar menu: the stuffed pretzel.  Normally I wouldn't order a stuffed pretzel at a place with such upscale option and don't feel the need to order it again but it was solid.  The mustard that comes with it is awesome.  It was quite filling.  Next we got the ham plate.  No one warned me about how large this was!  I was expecting a regular charcuterie plate...I was wrong.  There are three hams: a smoked Virginia, a serrano, and a procuitto.  It comes with some bread and spicy mustard.  Holy awesome.  I thought the Virginia ham would be an afterthought with the strong competitors on the plate but it was so unbelievable.  If you get this though, beware, it is huge!  The pig tails were outstanding.  It comes in sort of an eggroll with the tails prepared sort of like pulled pork with this refreshing salad.  Your tastebuds will be happy you got this.  One of my companions was a little grossed out at the thought of pig tails and then could not stop eating it.  We then got the sweetbreads.  I am a sucker for sweetbreads and whenever they're on the menu, I'm ordering.  This was probably my least favorite.  I really liked the preparation and the rest of what was on the plate was great but the sweetbreads themselves had an off texture.  Sweetbreads are usually almost fatty and have a really buttery texture but these were more like chicken...I don't know if it was the type of meat or perhaps overcooked?  Lastly was the whitefish.  This may have been my favorite dish, although it's too hard to choose.  It was suggested and glad it was.  It is served with nice, crispy skin and succulent fish but the homerun was the broth it was served in.  it was sort of a corn chowder type.  So amazing.  I already needed to be rolled home so might as well get some fried stout.  I'm not a dessert person but this was so yummy.  Some complimentary porter pairings?  Don't mind if we do!  From start to finish this was out of this world and I cannot wait to go back!"
"Okay, so I'm at Dusek's, writing a review about Dusek's. That's how you know how good it is. I'm a wine girl but this place is known for their beer. Asked the bartender for a recommendation, told him I hated IPAs but liked Blue Moon. He NAILED IT with ""Off Color Troublesome"". A marvelous combination of Summer Shandy and Blue Moon and I don't know, just deliciousness. On beer three and only stopping because it's closing time.Food: ordered a Gouda stuffed pretzel with spicy mustard (aka beer mustard) and was sorely disappointed - no cheese gushing out and pretzel was a bit burnt. No bueno. Enter manager: she heard that I was a bit disappointed and I said I would like to replace said pretzel with a ""Wood Roasted Crab Dip"" (which I have had before and is amazing!).Replaced with: ""Wood Roasted Crab Dip"" AND a new pretzel AND extra side Gouda cheese! Chyeah! Can't say much about Friday and Saturday busy nights but Sunday night service was the bomb! Do yourself a favor, come here. You won't be disappointed."
"We've come to this place twice for food and drinks on a Friday night! Both times the service has been great and the food consistently is good and flavorful. The Juicy Lucy is apparently a must have burger, but in my opinion its a pretty decent burger but not the best. I'd go for their many other great options like the pork shoulder, steak, etc. Would definitely come back here. Also the atmosphere is great!"
"This place has only been over for a few weeks and it feels like it has been over for 5 years.  The Longman & Eagle team makes a seamless transition into Pilsen with great food, drinks, atmosphere and service.Showed up with a group of 4 at 7:30 on a Thursday and was seated immediately. The waiter perfectly explained how the menu works and what beers to pair with it. There was even an amuse bouche of smoke sturgeon that was unreal. Everything we had was delicious: oysters, duck fat fries, monkfish, boneless duck wings, pork tenderloin. Then downstairs is Punch Bar which has great drinks and a nice layout to relax after eating. Definitely cannot wait to go back."
Bartenders are very friendly. They love what they are doing. They know their food and drink. They suggest a lot of good stuff. I will always come back
Nice inside to the place. Good for the area
"All in all, my experience as Dusek's was exceptional - can't recommend this place enough!My boyfriend and I went here for dinner. They don't take reservations for parties of less than 5 people, but luckily we were seated right away. The dining room/first floor is gorgeous - beautiful woodwork and ambiance.We ordered oysters (chef's choice), flounder (with pickled mango and pea shoots), and ""The Ordinary,"" which is a dish that they change up and you have to ask your server what it is that night. That night it was a duck dish with pear salad. We also got the beer pairing to go along with the meal (they collaborate with a local brewery). This dish was delicious and the duck was cooked perfectly. I was also pleased with the bill - for 2 people it was under $100 (including drinks and dessert). If you went somewhere else that was of this quality, it would most likely be more.After dinner we went down to the Punch House (the bar downstairs) to meet up with some friends. They have multiple punches on tap, and I got the gin tea punch - so tasty. We also shared a punch bowl. It was getting busy downstairs, so the service started lacking a little. Otherwise, good experience.They are also restoring Thalia Hall which will be a small music venue and is scheduled to be finished early 2014... can't wait to see it!I will definitely be back!"
I went here for brunch with a friend. I had the Oyster Hash and an orange juice. My selection was really different from my usual brunch choice. It had a nice presentation and tasted good. The environment was pretty nice. I will come here again for dinner or drinks.
"My husband and I love Longman & Eagle and Parson's, so we were excited to check out Dusek's after Phil mentioned it to us this summer when we were at L&E. We love the space and cannot wait to see Thalia Hall open.As it was a cold day, I began with the Dusek Warmer and wait staff steered my husband to a great red wine. She let him try three, and that was a great way to entice him to make his selection.  We had the mussels for the appetizer. The spices on the shells were amazing, but too intense for me. The sauce was amazing.Husband ordered the bouillabaisse as an entree and I ordered the Juicy Lucy. I loved my food experience, my husband enjoyed everything except for his bouillabaisse. The wait staff said it could be an entree size, but he was still very hungry. I then got the House Gin & Tonic. Such an amazing drink! We ended the evening with coffee and the Ginger Cazuela Cake. We were both so impressed with the dessert. Husband thought that the G&T and dessert were the two impressive parts of the dinner. The entire staff was very attentive."
All the food was so well-made and it was an awesome atmosphere for a big group of people
"great bar, really cool, good food, the punch house downstairs also very cool :D"
"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant!  We walked in the door and were greeted by two wonderful women who seemed so happy to see us and have us enter their establishment.  While we waited for a table, we went to the bar and the two bartenders were extremely friendly and helpful, mixing a special drink for my guest and pouring me scotch 'that they drink in Scotland'.  Our server was friendly and we got the feeling that everyone there took pride in being part of the amazing restaurant experience.You must try the mussels - I have never had mussels that were as tender as the ones served to us at Dusek's.....like butta!!  The seasoning was so good I actually licked my fingers unabashedly in public.  Our server told us to rub the mussels on the shell to get the seasoning.  We couldn't get enough of them.The blue crab dip was divine and although we wanted to order more, we stuffed ourselves with mussels and couldn't eat anything else.I am dreaming about Dusek's mussels today and can't wait to go back and try brunch.  It's been a long time since I walked into a restaurant and had such a good experience with an entire staff who takes pride in the meals that they serve."
"Adore this place so happy it's in my new hood.  Went there on a Monday night with friends and we were treated like royalty.  Great atmosphere, love the history of the joint and the cool beer flights!   I highly recommend this place!"
"Dusek's... Welcome to Pilsen!Awesome space in the Thalia Hall building.  Comfortable, good tunes, warm lighting, spacious.  Food:  Oysters were very fresh, prawns and grits were great, and the pretzel went great with a pint of Ayinger Octoberfest!  The desserts are amazing as well.  Prices were very reasonable, with most dishes in the $15 range.  Beer:  Excellent beer list.  As much as I love Chicago and Midwestern craft beers, it's nice to see a beer list that pays homage to German and Belgian styles as well, many of which pair better with food than hop-forward IPA's.After dinner, head downstairs and grab a booth at Punch House!Loved it and will be back very soon!"
I was at punch house tonight around 9pm and all of a sudden a bunch of Hispanics started throwing bottles at a party for no reason and then they ran. The bar did nothing to protect its patrons. Seems to be the standard nowadays in Pilsen and at duseks.
"I organized a party in the beer cellar, and they did a fantastic job. The food was great (the lobster rolls were a big hit), the punches were fun and delicious, and Elizabeth's team was very easy to work with and attentive. I couldn't recommend them more highly for a private event."
"I went for brunch and was underwhelmed by the food.  I had the Oyster Hash and it wasn't that tasty or filing. I appreciate the smaller portion size but it really left me hungry especially when there were only three fried oysters that were mostly breading.  Again perhaps it is my fault for expecting more.  Also the Dutch Baby is pretty bland as far as sweets go.   It could use some additional powdered sugar or syrup.  However, the coffee (Dark Matter) is great and the service was excellent, really nice waiter.  Also, the crowd was quite diverse.  Contrary to what many might say, it wasn't hipster in the least.  It was mostly adults with well behaved young children of all ages.  I'll go back probably to be proven wrong because I like Longman and that perhaps it is just about finding the right items."
"My cousin who lives in Pilsen (does that make her a Pilsner?) suggested we meet for drinks at this new place last weekend.  I don't really frequent the area, but any suggestion she makes is usually a good one.  After learning that it was created by the Longman & Eagle chef, my expectations were raised slightly.  The design of Dusek's was really impressive, from early 20th century gold lettering on the windows, to the dark wood interior (and surprisingly comfy barstools).  Paging through their beer list, I was quite impressed at the selection this place offered, but once I set my eyes on the bourbon selection, I knew what I'd be having all night.  My first drink was a bourbon old fashioned, and it was quite impressive.  I went with the bartender's suggestion of whiskey (and subsequently forgot), which was accented nicely with bitters, a burnt orange peel, and a sweet, dark cherry.  Standard, but good, and seeing the bartender actually light the orange rind with a match was pretty cool.  I also had a Bulleit rye on the rocks, and then went against the grain with the same thing in an old fashioned.  All in all, drinks were great and not too pricey.We also ordered some snacks; my cousin the stuffed pretzel and I some sort of pork spread and a baguette.  Although I wasn't sure quite what to expect with mine, I was pleasantly surprised.  The spread was topped with diced tomato, and had a bean dip-like consistency.  It was a nice, savory complement to the sweeter old fashioned I was enjoying at the moment, and my only real complaint is that there was about a quarter of the spread left over after I'd finished the bread.  I didn't get to try the pretzel because my cousin was apparently ravenously hungry.After she'd finished her cocktail, she wanted some beer to go with the pretzel, so she asked the bartender for some recommendations.  Instead of making her rely on verbal description, he gave her flight of 3 samples: a farmhouse ale, something hoppier, and an Oktoberfest (which was apparently the ""last barrel in the city"").  His knowledge of the beer menu was quite impressive, the guy was clearly a pro and loved doing what he does.Upon receiving our tab 2 appetizers and plenty of drinks later, we were a bit taken aback by the seemingly cool bartender's last comment.  He asked, since our names are Anne and Frank, if we ever get called collectively ""Anne Frank"".  Neither of us are ones to take offense at anything, but the joke seemed to be haphazard and in poor taste.  Maybe he had a few drinks on the clock?  Not sure, but that's minus one star for, and this is probably the only time I'll give this deduction on yelp, borderline antisemitism.  Might want to keep the off color jokes in check, guy.  You never know when you're going to have a Holocaust survivor descendant at the bar."
I just recently experienced this place last year with a few colleagues and has been such a treat coming here for food and drinks! Such a great destination in the heart of Pilsen! Dusek's for food and Punch House for some amazing drinks...what more can I Say! I also want to say thank you so so much for retrieving my lost flash drive I've been missing for weeks now and receiving it in the mail today! You guys are the absolute best! I will be seeing you guys very very soon!
"Went this evening to Dusek's and I didn't enjoy the food that much. We started with the fritters and crab dip.  The fritters were a bit boring and salty.  The best part of the dip was the soft, crusty bread.  The dip itself wasn't that good. Too many bread crumbs.  We also had the ham & cheese (great bread, nice thin slices of meat) and the ""Juicy Lucy"" burger.  Over all it was okay, nothing to motivate me to come back.  Also the kitchen was extremely slow between courses."
"A cornucopia of tastes, smells, and flavors, served in a beautifully renovated building in historic Pilsen by clean grunge loving knowledgeable servers= a spectacular evening. Things lived mussels ( best I ever tasted) w Harissa butter and pimenton, amazing duck fat fries, great tangine, absolutely amazing KFQ Kentucky fried quail. There was one dish that had marvelous polenta...I mean this place rocked everywhere. We had the waiter pick our meal and he clearly knew what he was doing. The chilli churos reminded me of Minnesota State Fair donuts taken to a whole different level w dulce de lechwe. Great beer selections at reasonable prices. Ambiance was great loved the feel of the Punch Bar and Thalia Hall. I was blown away. Let it ride here and just go with it! You can't go wrong!"
I like the vibe for the place but a $28 dollar lobster roll is kind of absurd. Coming from an east coast girl but still.....it seemed very over priced for food.
"The downstairs punch house is amazing.  Great service, great drinks, great atmosphere!"
"Born and raised in Pilsen, must say that it has changed. So many different restaurants to choose from. Decided to check this place out and must say that the decor is very hippie, not stylish at all. Food was over priced for the portions. I had the cheese platter and to be honest Jewel has a better selection of cheese. I don't recommend this place at all."
Food was excellent if s bit pricy. Loved the Tagine and the Pumpkin Risotto. Desserts were luscious and generous. Music is too loud to carry on normal conversation. Service was pleasant but very slow and disorganized. We amused ourselves watching waitstaff dash around to no apparent purpose.
"I'm so happy this place opened up in the neighborhood---it's our go-to spot! The service is always great and they have consistently sent us a little something extra to apologize for kind of (at least in my opinion) trivial things. I would describe the food as unusual, but everything I've tried so far has been cooked well and tasted fantastic. Love this place."
"A Saturday night for dinner...for 2Food was awesome. Atmosphere was really nice. Service was great. Zero complaints but I'm not much of a complainer. The beer selection was great and super creative. Oysters were greatVeggie tagine pretty good.All the fish items were great. I eat fish not really meat so that's all we had.The chocolate bar dessert was so good.The price was very good for what we got and the service really was perfect.All around it is the best ""new place"" I've tried in a long time.  I'll go back for sure.Love Pilsen too. Great spot and cool building. The punch bar downstairs seemed really cool too but I didn't actually have a drink there."
"aw yeah, my girls and i du the seks so hard.  too bad that joke gets old real fast.i was able to see the raw space before it became dusek's + punchroom.  they did a fantastic job.  they restored as best they could.  it's a gem in the heart of pilsen.  cool ceiling tiles, light fixtures.  it's a beaut.they brought out amuse bouche to begin, which was quite delicious.  not sure if that's standard or because we're all so pretty.  also, boobs.  we ordered:tagine - not bad, but not my favorite thing.broccolini - this was AWESOME.  definitely do-over, definitely my favorite.green beans - these were just ok - not memorable.pork shank - this was fall off da bone, tasty and delish.  the hush pups con cheddar were mmmm.  overall, all the components were good.  i took it home and went to bed with it.  lobster pot pie - the crust was great, but the inside could have been better.crab dip - yes, do this.pretzel - the beer mustard dip was mustardy and tasty.come for the ambiance if anything. it's tres seks-y.  after you're done, go downstairs to punch room."
"I've lived in Pilsen for a while now and this has to be my #1 place to go for drinks and food. One, drinks can't be better. Their punch menu is delicious if you're drinking at the bar or downstairs at Punch House. A couple of those fellas will leave you nicely buzzed. The beer menu for the restaurant is also very extensive, with many craft beers ready cold on tap. If you're not a punch but a beer enthusiast, this can be a good stop. As for food, I literally teared up eating Dusek's meatloaf. If you have $$$ to spend for a good night of splurging and self-indulging, treat yourself to this restaurant. Oh yeah, and get the cheese platter."
Pan-roasted mussels with smoky paprika ( don't be shy -- just lick the shell!!). Gin and tonics where they finish off the drink table side with some sort of artisanal tonic.  I think I have just discovered the meal I want for my last night on earth -- regardless of how the end comes!!!I have been a few times now -- always waaay earlier in the evening so I have not had to deal with the legendary wait times for walk ins later at night.  I have never been disappointed.  I will always remember this place as where I finally got to try ramps while they were still on someone's seasonal menu!Burger is awesome.  Just tried some sort of smoked duck meatloaf and was more than happy.  I find the staff to be knowledgable in an approachable way -- no superiority complex or trying to intimidate with fancy explanations or descriptions.  Also appreciate that someone from either management or the front of the house stops by at some point to engage in a meaningful discussion. At least when I have been there.  I was so concerned this was going to be a Brooklyn-esque annoying hipster place but it is much cooler than that!!
"Got two dishes to split with the table. Quick recap:1.) Country Fried Steak: awesome gravy, extremely well cooked, great dish. 2.) The Ordinary: three crepes with rabbit and a creamy sauce (somewhat of a gravy). Very good again. Definitely worth the trip to Pilsen."
Mussels and their desserts are da best.  I find the majority of their other dishes good but meh.
"A brunch standout in a very crowded scene.  Beermosa is a creative, delicious idea.  Donuts are outrageous.  Food and service are first rate.  Definitely will return."
"I took my girlfriend here for her birthday on Monday. We were both VERY disappointed with the experience as a whole. Starting things off the vibes there were a little weird. The waitress seemed to be a little judgey - not very welcoming. We were her only table at the time. She went through the menu with us and we both ordered a beer. We got the green beans as an appetizer, pretty tasty. Our waitress must've entered our order in wrong because when the food runner brought our food out he was very surprised to learn that wasn't our order. I sat there with my food getting cold while I waited for my girlfriends food to come back out. After a while the waitress came out and offered to take my food back to keep it warm. So then about 10 minutes later she brought my burger back out after it was sitting under the warming lamps in the back. then after another 5 minutes she finally brought my girlfriends food out. This COMPLETELY ruined my food. By the time I actually got to eat my burger it was dry and cold. I was very unsatisfied with it.  She said she liked her food, the lobster pot pie. After we were more than half way done with out meals, about 15 minutes later the waitress finally came back to check on us. She came over asked if we were okay but didn't really stay long enough for me to answer. At this point as far as I could tell she had two other tables of two. Usually when this type of thing happens we are pretty easy going and understanding. The waitress did nothing to make sure we were having a good experience and did nothing to make up for her obvious mistake. She just ignored us while chatting up her other two tables. Probably thought she already missed out on her tip? I dunno, either way we also didn't see any managers on the floor or anyone else to check up. For a relatively new place - this is almost a death blow. I will not be coming back and if anyone asks me about the place, I will recommend them to check some of the other restaurants in the area. Bottom Line:Dusek's is trying too hard in all the wrong areas and not trying hard enough in the areas that matter."
"I went here for brunch last weekend. The food was tasty, and the service attentive and the atmosphere was stylishly classy and relaxing. I was very happy."
"Tried to eat dinner here Friday night after a concert upstairs. Although the atmosphere was awesome, we, unfortunately, left because at 11pm, they were out of all 4 of the items we were going to order, including roast chicken and lobster roll. I know we were dining late, but you would think that a restaurant downstairs from a music venue would have either a better stocked kitchen, or at least a lighter late-night menu. Maybe next time."
"I've heard so many positive things, I finally made it out here.  Good experience but for the inconvenience of getting to Pilsen from Lakeview I can't recommend anyone going out of their way to go there. If you're close it might be worth a spot.  The menu and taste of the food reminds you a lot of the Longman, but a slightly healthier, more seafood focused place. More emphasis on small plates and sharing as well.  Its expensive for the size of the dishes, and they being small requires order quite a few.  Everything we had was good, but nothing was great, so I left a little hungry and disappointed.  The general tso sweetbreads were the highlight of the night.  Nothing else stood out, I will soon forget this meal. For being a beer focused place the draft list was pretty boring. 24 drafts, almost all pretty common stuff in Chicago. Only 1 kind of rare beer on the whole list. I usually prefer beer but I could have easily skipped and just had a cocktail. The cocktails were pretty good but not worth making the trip for them."
"Sunday Brunch! Sunday Brunch! Sunday Brunch! Awesome spot for Sunday Brunch! Don't think about this too hard. It's fun, the food is very good n fresh, and the place looks great. Just go already."
Fabulous restaurant. Worth the drive/cab if you live in LP/Lakeview. So great. They have a great drink menu. Wonderful Old Fashion's and a great wine list. Love it! Love the food to! The grilled octopus is fabulous... love the Moroccan salad/bowl. Soooo good. We brought our out of town friends and the loved it to. Highly recommend just sharing a bunch of stuff. Can't go wrong!
"What a fun place. So glad they brought this to the neighborhood. We've been for the hosted dinner on valentines day which was incredible (took forever to finish the full service tho) and then a few other times to drink. The staff is nice, music is always good and the drinks are great as well. Haven't gotten to try any of the food from the standard menu yet but I'm looking forward to it. It will definitely be my summer hang out spot."
"This restaurant aims to please, we had reservations and they weren't able to sit us right away.  Because we had to wait they provided us with free appetizers which a lot of places don't do. The servers are knowledgeable and passionate about the food and drinks they serve.  Drinks were good, loved the appetizers and desserts. I didn't like my entree but it was probably because I was unknowingly pregnant and big meals  overwhelm me."
"Awesome food and drinks! Nice hidden location too! My girlfriend got the fried quail, which was surprisingly amazing and I got the jucy lucy with duck-fat fries, which was also amazing and incredibly juciy. Then we went to punch house downstairs. Great selection of punch, but one downside is that you can't get their draft beer at the punch house. However, some of the food (sandwhiches) is also available downstairs which is a plus."
"I want to give this place a 3 because I liked it enough but something is up on my phone. Ill change it when I can. I'm refraining from using names just in case I get something wrong, so this may tend to be a bit general.Why a 3? I was a bit underwhelmed. I came in expecting super awesome fantabulous because of the buzz and I did get fantabulous: drinks and dessert which aren't what I went for. We had a group of 6 and most of us got different cocktails; all of them were fun and tasty and worth the price (which weren't too bad considering what you're getting). Another highlight was the hommade soda pop. I had one that tasted a bit like fizzy wheatgrass juice with lemon and it was great. Desssert was another highlight.they had some really neat twists on a traditionalidea on the concept of dessert. Mine was actually a cocktail with a meringue-like topping and two yummy cookies.all of us got different ones and loved all of them.As for the main entree, I had the burger (I'm pretty sure it was called the juicy Lucy). Why did I go for a burger? because it was one of the cheaper items (you know when you going a place and they have all those fancy combinations and a price that reflects that fanciness?yea.) and because they had a bacon marmalade which was spot on and made what was a run of the mill hamburger stuffed with melted cheese into something very good. As for the other main entrees (my friends all ordered fish dishes) they were very well done. The scallops in particular were perfect. but Lord help me, those dishes were tiny (except for the mussels. That was a huge platter and my friend couldn't finish them). You felt bad about sharing because there just wasn't that much. This is a city of people who like to eat. Give us enough food to share AND enjoy.or cut the prices.The wait staff was polite but our waiter was either reluctant or unprepared to give recommendations which is kind of a bummer because you want, at times, an insider's knowledge of what is the bizness - and what ain't. The music was entirely too loud. We had a small table and had to yell to hear each other.In general, this was a good place to check out, I'm glad I came, but I was really hoping for a homerun and got a solid double instead."
"Finally landed at Dusek's after hearing many great things (local write ups and buzz) about the place.  Very cool atmosphere - dark and classic old school bar feel.  There was an hour wait so we tried our luck at the bar.  I sat, he stood.  The service was very good - the female bartender was very nice and accommodating.  I enjoyed watching them put together complex cocktails.  The drink menu is extensive and sophisticated. The crowd was refreshingly eclectic and friendly as well.  The dinner menu was mouth-watering.  We ordered the crab 'dip', but unfortunately it was more like a crab cake in a hot pot (quite dry albeit very crabby).  We also ordered the mussels.  The mussels were unique, more spicy than buttery, and not juice for my bread that I've come to enjoy when ordering mussels. Finally, I was so looking forward to the '24 hour short rib' to arrive at table, claiming to my huzz: 'I'm eating the entire thing'.  Well it was not what I expected at all. It was a nice cut of meat but it was not a braised short rib like I had expected (I enjoy slow cooked, fall apart goodness).  It was more like a sliced steak.  I don't do steak, so I only had one bite.  My husband ate the whole thing and said it was fine...for a steak.  I'd try it again if someone was interested in going, but it's didn't make me a loyal visitor.  I'm thinking of trying the Punch Bar next."
"Friday night, in the mood for hearty food and a good cocktail. I live in McKinley park so there is no shortage of delicious Italian, Mexican or Chinese food. This particular evening I wanted something more American and to yelp I turned and found Dusek's. I was so pleased with my experience there, first of all it's beautiful. The ambiance is on point. Lighting, music that's not to loud and warm welcoming staff. We didn't have a reservation so the wait was 45(totally worth it) they text you when your table is ready so you can grab a drink downstairs which is what we did. I had the melon punch, divine. Then we had the chips, very good. Dinner for me was lobster roll and fries cooked in duck fat. The fries were my favorite, I didn't realize the lobster would be cold(still delicious) the warm garlic pretzel bread sealed the deal. I was with a manly man who ordered the steak but felt like there wasn't enough meat. We both left full drunk and happy.  I recommend."
"Great ambience, excellent drinks, surprisingly good food, and cool staff. Hidden gem"
"I ventured to Dusek's because it is ""the hottest new place in town"". It exceeded all my expectations. The name is a tribute to Jon Dusek, a Czech immigrant, who  built the place in the 1870s. The menu pays tribute to him as well with the sweetest line up of good Czech beer on tap I have seen in a while. They also have Fernet, a must try. The clientele and bartender were super friendly. Once the bartender learned I had a love of Malort, he whipped me up a sample of their house cocktail with it. Attentive, quick service, friendly and the food - yum! It might be my Czech roots but I think the catfish had a decidedly Czech touch, with a massive modern facelift, as well. There is a great bar downstairs and upstairs they play live music in a room that was designed after the Prague Opera House. Oh, and the bathroom walls are all chalk so you can leave a little graffiti like note. Great spot. I'll be back."
Staff is casual with great service. Dusek's is an upscale meal with a comfy setting. The wait can be very long and the popularity can get annoying but that just because this place rocks.
"Great beer selection (upstairs) but the upper bar is still working out the kinks: waiting 20 minutes to get a beer is not working. Bar Downstairs is unfortunately themed: ""punch"" and bottled beer only, while upstairs has all the good draft beer. :( Pricing is a little high for Pilsen, but it seems like every new place that opens raises the prices a little more. There's fortunately a dive bar on the same corner that still have fast service, and cheap beer. There are a few beers for under $6, but it looks like  $6 is the median price.  The food looked good."
This is one those places that transcends one into another place in time. Hipster bar/restaurant with a punch room in basement (bonus)! I have had appetizers (so far) and they were great. Drinks are unique. Staff is very friendly.
not bad.  food was fresh and service was good.  hope it sticks around in the pilsen neighborhood.
"The Crispy Pork Shank is HEAVENLY... the dish combines an amazingly crispy and flavorful crust with tender, fall-off-the bone meat... not to mention greens that have an acidic component that balances the richness of the meat.  neatly diced and nicely seasoned potatoes and out of this world hush puppies take this dish over the top.  So good.  So filling.The Mussels were good.  Other reviewers wrote this, but the seasoning is on the outside of the shells.  Love the smokiness of the dish.  Some of the mussels were tiny but this is offset by the sheer number of mussels you get.  This is definitely a dish to share.I also had the Venison Tartare.  Very delicate flavors and fresh meat make this also a good choice.Of the above, I would definitely order the pork shank again and then explore the rest of the menu with other items.  What a gem in Pilsen."
Been here and crushed.
The menu descriptions are terrible and incomplete.  The waitress had to explain every item I chose.  The overall vibe is very pretentious and the food was not that great.
"Dusek's, I wanted to like you so badly. The wait was about an hour but went by quickly with their yummy cocktails. I had the feathered crown. All the drinks and food were very reasonably priced as far as chicago trendy restaurants go. We ordered mussels, octopus, lobster pot pie, fries, broccolini and skirt steak. We had to send the mussels back bc they were barely open. The next batch was no better - my friend had to spit one out bc it tasted so fowl. The pot pie and octopus were highlights. Everything else was just average and they could pay more attention to details like providing clean new plates for the second course. I'm hoping we came here on an off night bc everyone loves this place but I will not be returning."
Super chill bar downstairs. Really tasty drinks. Got a couple gin based punch drinks then moved upstairs. The risotto is awesome. Will definitely come back. Our waiter was great. He was really helpful at explaining the menu.
"This has quickly become one of our favorite places to take friends. The beer menu, is of course, amazing and the wait staff know their stuff....I've always gotten great recommendations. As a veg, there are limited options, but their tagine is sooooo good. I'll get around to trying the risotto eventually, but I keep getting that tagine.And did I mention the ginger cazuela cake? Our waiter accidentally brought us one the first time we were there and now I crave it all the time.It's maybe a little loud sometimes for conversation, depending on where you are sitting, but I heart this place."
"I would like to see more local options on the beer menu. Pipeworks, Three Floyds, Half Acre, and 5 Rabbits are a few that are not represented and should be. I felt like the pig tail was lacking pig tail, there was a disproportionate amount of garnish. Other than that I loved the place. The general Tzo's sweetbreads was both the best sweetbread dish and best general Tzo's anything I've had, a brilliant amount of heat and great selection of garnish. The Kentucky fried quail was pretty good too. The place is gorgeous and I love the location. I'm excited to return and sample some punches downstairs. The punch house looks like a basement party equipped with fish tank, turn tables, and a cozy couch behind which is a shelf of knickknacks."
"Dusek's caught my attention exclusively through word of mouth. A beautiful building with amazing cocktails and even better food echoed throughout the city. And so we went, but unfortunately only confusion and disappointment are what I remember about it. To start we ordered the Moroccan spiced vegetable tagine, an overly sweet Moroccan seasoning with strong curry flavors coated every vegetable, it wasn't that it tasted bad necessarily, it was just too much of a good thing. The couscous served a nice purpose cleansing my palate, but they were aggressively overcooked. As soft as wet bread. We also ordered the shrimp and Anson mills grits dish which I dont believe is on the menu anymore (and for good reason). The shrimp were nice, not overcooked, crunchy shell, fresh tasting. The grits on the other hand were bland and gooey. They definitely needed more liquid and salt for that matter, and the whole dish was topped off with an under cooked  egg, it was snotty for lack of a better word. Lastly we ordered the juicy lucy. A shameful reproduction of the Minneapolis classic. The burger itself was overcooked and much smaller than my fist, then stuffed with an oily cheddar and topped with a bacon marmalade that was underwhelming at best.  The fries were nothing special either, in fact they were greasy and lacked any sort of crunch. It's such a shame the food was as bad as it was, I pass through that area often."
"Came here for dinner and some drinks. This place can go from empty to packed with a wait in a matter of minutes! We called for wait times, and they said there was immediate seating.  Got there 15 minutes later, and there was an hour and a half wait all of a sudden. Nonetheless, we decided to wait it out. Went to their bar downstairs, which was a pretty cool, unique setting. Ordered some apps, which were amazing. By the time we were finally seated for dinner, we were already drunk. We ordered a few dishes to share, and it ok. I would recommend coming here for sure, but plan accordingly."
"Came here prior to a party, so didn't have as much time to spend here as I would have liked, but for the time that was spent, I felt this place was excellent.  The service from the hostess, to the bartenders and the servers was great. It felt genuine, welcoming, and appropriate. The atmosphere felt inviting and comfortable, and not pretentious  in the least. It is dark, old school, but creative and chic. I'm not a beer drinker, but my dining partner is, and said the beer list is great and affordable. There is good variety of cocktails, all only $8.00. I very much enjoyed my Duseks punch. It was warm, and seasonal. Had I had another, it would have knocked me on my ass. The menu is great- many affordable items of different sizes, easy to share or not. On our time crunch, we only ordered  shared the green beans (really delicious), the crispy pig tail (our least favorite), and the lobster pot pie, which was exceptional. Packed with flavor, and perfectly rich and decadent.Will definitely be returning again and again, and really looking forward to trying other items on the menu."
"My co workers decided to throw my bridal shower at Duseks, knowing my love of new restaurants. We were seated at a large table in the back of the restaurant and our server was incredibly accommodating. He quickly took our cocktail orders, made great recommendations and left us to ponder the menu. With our group of about 15 people we were served with perfect pacing between dishes and everyone was satisfied with their meals. We started with the mussels and they were perfect to share. They were spicy and addictive. We continued with the tagine, which was unexpectedly the best thing we ate all night. It was also spicy, but combined a crazy amount of spices with the couscous and vegetables that was unlike any dish I've ever tasted. The ham board was also beautiful and delicious. We almost asked for seconds of the buttery bread that was served with it. The restaurant even let us bring in a cake and served it to our party. I would love to come back again for a date night and know it won't be too long until I do!"
"Really enjoyed Dusek's! The building is very cool-- love its history and I'm excited to see the upstairs when it opens. Though it was frigid out (10 degrees the night we went) and the dining rooms are large, Dusek's felt like a cozy living room. Our server was endearingly earnest. He wasn't overly chatty, but was helpful and steered us in the right direction with both food and drinks. My husband and I had a warm cocktail to start and a couple of interesting beers with our meal. The food is delicious, though on the heavy side (a bit like au cheval, but with more sophisticated flavors mixed in). It wasn't a cheap meal, but for what you get, it's very reasonable. I'm excited to come back!"
"A - First, Just want to say that I was very impressed when Dusek's first opened. I was excited for it to join my neighborhood and add to the new eats and drinks popping up. Service was outstanding, the food - amazing. Definitely needed to be back.A - So this past February - I tried their brunch for my birthday. Three girlfriends and I loved every bite. Must come back!C- Then another visit was a little disappointing. Our order was never put in and it wasn't noted until three tables surrounding us came, had appetizers main courses, managed dessert, and left. Still there my friend and I waited. They owned up to the mistake which we appreciated, offered dessert. We thought, this isn't like them and having worked in the service industry understood that it was just one of those nights. 3 hours later, we finally left. I cant say our food was delicious because we were starving at that point. But afterwards, a dessert offer just didn't seem to cover the mistake.C(minus) - Yesterday, I decided to try again, because why not 1 bad experience out of 2 previous ones shouldn't shut my wanting to go back down. Went with the same guest where our order was forgotten only for brunch because hey in February, brunch was great! Service was slow, the restaurant wasn't full. We waited about 10 minutes for a drink order, another 10 or so for drinks to be brought (and by drinks it was just a beermosa for my friend, I was fine with water). Another 10 minutes to come back to take our order, and then....40 minutes for an omelette and ham benedict. After about 30 minutes I asked our server to check on our dishes - he said the kitchen got backed up it should be coming soon he offered pastries, but I wasn't going to let that be the remedy this time around. About 10 minutes later our food arrives (the Bears had gone into the 4th quarter) The omelette was cold, the potatoes, cold. My friend's dish also a bit lukewarm.....I don't know...Perhaps the remedy is just to hit PunchHouse below to numb the angst of waiting a whole football game to eat an omelette and some ham on toast. Proceeding with major caution."
"Last night an out of town buddy and I had just an amazing meal at Dusek's on 18th St. I have to say the staff was outstanding and the food was wonderful. The space was really cool and invites you to relax and commiserate. I am definitely planning the next time there with a group of friends to enjoy the ambience, food and all around great experience. Thanks to everyone there for a wonderful night!"
Came here for a la card. This place is cozy and the service is good. Everything is relatively cheap too. Black and white risotto was filling but not too heavy. The fried stout is absolutely delicious and great for sharing. Since it's winter and freezing at any point in time here in Chicago I recommend the dusek warmer cocktail as well. It's a great way to warm up.
"Went for the 1st time last week. It is a really cool place with great circuses great service and great drinks. The food was just ok. There were 4 of us and nobody was wowed by the food. I will go back for brunch to give it a try. The neighborhood is dicey,"
"Drinks were great. Had the roasted chili churros which was really good. We also ordered to boneless duck wings and the duck fat fries. The duck fat fries were good but nothing special and the boneless duck wings were extremely disappointing. They were under- seasoned, dry pieces of duck, rolled and fried in a super bland hot sauce. Really bad dish! But would definitely go back for drinks."
