Nini’s Deli
"Great service, and even better food. The steak and cheese empanadas are to die for! Light, nice crunch, the steak was beautifully cooked and the cheese was beautiful. I ordered Ropa Vieja, a pulled chicken sandwich, and it was everything I could have asked for. My bread was toasted nicely, the chicken itself had amazing flavor and when topped with the sports pepper, the entire sandwich came together amazingly. The hibiscus lemonade is a must have. And finishing off with some churros was perfect. Light, but full of flavor. Definitely making this my go to for a quick lunch."
"This place is right down the block from my apartment and I will be trying it again and may update this review as I get to know their menu better. Pros: impeccable friendly service from the owner himself. He was all smiles and enthusiasm from the time we walked in the door to when we left. Loved the hibiscus lemonade: beautiful to look at, even better to drink. He gave us some sort of Cuban desert on the house at the end of our meal. Cons: I got their Cuban Steak sandwich. It was well constructed with quality ingredients. However, the steak itself was not too impressive. I found myself chewing on it far longer than I wanted to as it was not terribly tender. The flavor was largely lacking. I was expecting an explosion of flavor from the meat and it just wasn't there. I want to try more of their menu and see if there are other dishes that have the flavor I'd expect from a Cuban deli."
"Great food, awesome service, clean and fast. I ordered the shredded beef sandwich and my friend had the Cuban steak, both awesome choices.  Churro was fresh delish and cooked to order!  Two thumbs up ;)"
"I can't say enough good things about Nini's! I was traveling, super hungry, and it hit the spot.The atmosphere is really relaxed and comfortable, so I ended up staying for a few hours to do some work and thus tried a couple menu items:The Cuban steak egg and cheese is a must have; it's perfect for breakfast or brunch.-- Add a healthy amount of sriracha if you love yourself.At least one cafe con leche, really yummy pick-me-up after a heavy sammich-- Get one to go like I did, for good measure. The chicken empanadas are incredible. I've had a few that are dry meat and soggy - breading. Not these, *prayer hands*. Juicy, crunchy goodness. -- Drench 'em in the green sauce not because they need it, but because it's amazing.Hibiscus lemonade-- Especially if it's warm outI think the best way to experience Nini's is with a group of people so you can try as many things as possible. I've still got to go back to get the cuban churros, pb&j, sliders, and the list goes on!"
"I needed a quick bite to eat before practice, not something heavy like fast food. I looked around me for a decently priced food place and saw this place and oh man, this Cuban Steak sandwich is SO GOOD. I added avocado on mine which amazingly topped it off. The owner is really really friendly, in a very proud of his place way, I loved it, I wish everyone held the kind of pride he has for this amazing restaurant. Bummer it is only open till 6pm on weekdays BUT family is important and I understand where he is coming from."
"A little bit Cuba, a little bit Lebanese, we brought the smell home on our clothes and our kids said to remove them...please! Went with my hubby to meet one of his friends in the city, and on a whim we ended up eating at Nini's Deli. Everything on the menu looked so good, and I had a calling for the falafel sandwich on Cuban bread. When it came out, the bread was pressed, and I suddenly had a flasback to one of my favorite recent movies, Chef, and the Cuban sandwich truck. The falafal sandwich was spectacular. I didn't want onions and opted for fresh avocado over the cucumber. It was spicy with hummus, lettuce, and tahini sauce. It was so good, that my hubby went back and ordered another one for himself to go. Note: Cuban bread is really really good. And, I actually think they make it onsite - extra bonus.My hubby is an omelet guy and ordered up the El Cubanito, with fried plantains, American cheese and black beans. He loved it and would order it again for sure, but next time I wouldn't doubt it if he ends up with the vegetarian sliders. He had a hard time deciding.Upon entering the restaurant, the owners proudly greeted us. They were outgoing and friendly and asked us if we had eaten there before. We told them we hadn't, and my hubby mentioned he's a vegetarian. He was told he had arrived at the right place and we were walked through the menu. You will discover a great mix of meat and veggie options. I was told they specialize in their Cuban peanut butter and jelly sandwich, but that's not really my thing (see Jacqueline B's review for her PB&J experience).The decor is beautiful and urban. It's a big open room with a counter at the front. Actually, it kind of reminded me of a Potbelly's with their brick walls - typical traditional Chicago architecture. There is a very hip vibe inside, but it's also quite neighborhoody in feel. I got the sense there are a lot of regulars that stop in. Though we sat in a booth, I noticed many of the tables around us had checkerboards on them. How fun!The bill was reasonable - two hefty sandwiches for around $18. My takeaway...well aside from the obvious permeated clothing we brought home...is that this place is super authentic in the items it serves and you will not leave hungry. **Vegetarian Friendly"
"It's really hard to find nowadays good tasting food and let alone good quality food. Nini's definitely exceeded my expectation of that. I was super stoked, to find they have amazing vegetarian options. I got a Joseph wrap which consists of black beans,tomatoes, plantains, lettuce, scrambled eggs, onions, and avocado yumm!!!!! Last but not least the staff is amazing and there customer service level exceeds most high end restaurants I've eaten at in the city.  I would definitely recommend this place!!!!!!!!"
"The Cuban Steak sandwich was very good, but spend the extra dollar for the Cuban Steak, Egg, and Cheese.  Even if you're not in a breakfast-y mood, the addition of egg and cheese really brings the sandwich together.  Order a sweet empanada for dessert for a crisp, flaky, apple & peanut butter treat.  Finish it off with a hibiscus lemonade or a cafe con leche.  Everything we ordered was excellent.  Can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu, especially the savory empanadas and churros. Family run establishment.  Plenty of seating both indoors and out.  The owner up front is a super friendly young guy who clearly is proud of his place and loves what he does.  Good vibes all around."
"Great food and great atmosphere...as i waited in line i noticed the cashier was talking to almost everyone like if they were his family and friends..when it was our turn to go he right away knew it was our first time coming in and comfortably welcomed us in...without asking he kindly spoke of the place what its about and spoke of the menu...had a great time coming here i appreciate amazing customer service when i see it and this place has it...i ordered the media noche which was tasty considering it had sweet plantains with ham and swiss, and a chicken empanada which was very large and fulling finally finished it up with their hibiscuis lemonade"
"I love this place! It was my second time there and it did not disappoint. I ordered the steak slider, a vegetarian empanada and a cafe con leche. The slider consisted of Cuban steak, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, mayo and mustard served on tostones (plantain bread). It reminded me of a jibarito. I usually can't finish a big sandwich so this was the perfect size for me. The empanada was filled with spinach and cheese and came with a refreshing green salsa to go with it. I liked that there was a lot of filling and was crispy on the outside.I also enjoyed the cafe con leche. It wasn't too sweet or too strong. It was served in a cute mug.The guy who I think is the owner took my order and was so nice. It has a great neighborhood vibe. I'll definitely be back for delicious, affordable food and friendly service."
"I really enjoy the food and the chill atmosphere. The ambiance is really cool and trendy. The summertime is my favorite as I love to sit outside on the patio.The owner is friendly and is a great cook! Everyone that works there is friendly and outgoing and makes it feel like I'm home. My fave menu items are the Besos de Cuba, the Ropa vieja, and the empanadas. Also the Hibiscus Lemonade is soooo good. Nomnomnom"
"Ninis! Best spot for a snack or meal in Noble Square!  Clean, friendly, fast, and most importantly... Delicious! Stop by for a bite when in the neighborhood,  it's pretty easy on the wallet as well."
Five stars. Such a cool atmosphere and the food is phenomenal. Always have to stop in when I'm in the city. Staff is hot and nice.
"Ninis Deli is hands down the best Place to eat Love when I haven't had breakfast get the "" steak , egg & cheese sandwich"" and pour it down with a nice cold ""Ice cafe con leche"" the Slice apple with peanut butter in the empanada is my all time favorite desert that i started doing it at home ! And last great service and great people ! Big ups Juanny and his family"
Stopped in for my first time prior to an open house. I asked for theyre speciality sandwich which was the steak and cheese cuban. Mmmmm. Bery tasty. Bice portion with good cuban style bread. This place will be put into my regular rotation for lunch when in Noble Square.
"This place is truly a west side gem. The food was absolutely amazing and the service could not be better or more friendly if they tried. Between several of us, we ordered the Steak, Egg & Cheese, the Steak Empanada, the Hibiscus Lemonade, the Cafe con Leche, El Cubanito, and the Media Noche. When in doubt, always add avocado! I'm baffled by how they manage to get such perfect avocados to top off these amazing sandwiches. The steak sandwich was filling enough that I was only able to eat half and brought the rest home. We did not regret a single choice and look forward to returning to explore more of the menu. We showed up around 10:30am on a Saturday and it was fairly slow, and had moderately picked up before we left around 11:30. This is a great neighborhood spot to dine in or carry out!"
"What a gem.My new favorite place to eat, honestly.Being from Miami, I miss Cuban food so much and this place feels like I'm home.From the times I've been I've tried The Cubanito, the steak sandwich, steak empanada, the hummus and a churro. Not all at once. Oh! The hibiscus lemonade is bomb.comFor a first timer I would HIGHLY recommend the cubanito. Add avocado. It's like breakfast and lunch in one awesome sandwich.My favorite thing about here is the service, it makes or breaks your business. The staff always goes out of their way for everyone so they can have a great experience which is GREATLY appreciated. The Cuban music playing is also a nice touch :)"
"Was just there for the first time. Family owned business. Was greeted by Juan (son), one of the owners. Extremely nice and helpful. Had the Cuban Steak sandwich. Outstanding. Can't wait to go back and try everything else on the menu!"
"I'm so glad that this place has stayed on my list of go-to breakfast, lunch and early dinner. I'm a little embarrassed of my self for not reviewing this place any earlier, especially after the owners already know my name. :/ They're so friendly and accommodating. Out of all the sammiches my favorites have to be The Cubanito which is composed of black beans, egg, cheese, and plantains (sometimes I add avocado and chicken) and The Steak, Egg and Cheese. Quite frankly anything with egg and cheese is my favorite.. You also have the option of making any sandwich a wrap or for a lil extra choose to have it on gluten-free bread (since it's SO popular).. and the addition of a generous amount avocado that can be added for a $1 more. waaaaaay less than chipotle ya know what im sayin?Their pricing is average.. well actually for the Noble Square area they're pretty affordable. Strangely, since you can go down to Grand ave and pay like $12 for a sandwich half the size. The portions are huge and I either end up sharing my meal or taking it home. They also have tables available and a couple booths if you want to eat there, it's a great place for groups of 4 to 5.Mind you, it is NOT a typical deli where you grab and go. So don't expect a 2 minute sub sandwich to made for you.. if you want that, then march on over to jimmy johns just a few blocks away. This place not a fast food establishment. #Sorrynotsorry."
Really good food (and coffee!) and great friendly service.  I love the veggie sliders :  )
"So now that I finally signed up for Yelp I have to review this place!! It is delicious!!Customer service is great! Food is even more awesome!My favorite is the Media Noche and the Cuban Steak sandwich, they are huge and full of flavor! Worth the price but they just lowered their cost so I recommend if you haven't been in a while come back!! :) Its worth the wait, drive, walk, even if its down the stairs or outta state!! DELICIOUS FOOD!! ADDICTED TO Ninis Deli !!P.S: It is also pregnant woman heaven being that they sell Churros and are willing to accommodate your sandwich toppings at your request!"
One of my favorite places to eat ever! You can catch me here every single Thursday hanging out for a few hours drinking coffee and eating some great food with a group of friends as we get entertained by Juan. Truly one of the greatest family owned businesses that you will ever encounter. Juan and his family welcome you with open arms and make you feel right at home with genuine love and they really appreciate everyone that comes in and enjoys their wonderful food. Juan is constantly creating new ideas for the menu and loves asking for recommendations and ideas from his customers.I literally recommend everything and anything on the menu. I've honestly tried it all and it has all been more than delicious! I highly recommend the Cuban Steak as well as the Chicken ropa vieja! And of course I add an omelette to all of my sandwiches along with some avocados! The blend of all the flavors is honestly ridiculously good.Ninis Deli forever!
"I absolutely love this place, eat here at least once a week. I've had literally everything on the menu & it's all delicious. The service is fantastic, the owner is about as friendly of a person as I've ever met, & you'll never be disappointed with your meal. What else can you ask for?I was considering what I would recommend to someone who's never been here & was going to say the Cuban Steak because that's my favorite but everything is fantastic so just order whatever sounds good to you & I guarantee you'll love it."
This place is amazing!  Whatever you're in the mood for you'll find something to satisfy!  I love the steak sandwiches but the vegan options are just as good!
"I can't believe I waited so long to go here.  Off the beaten path and killing it with great flavor and consistent food.  Sandwiches, empanadas, sauces/salsas are all excellent.  Not the biggest fan of the high-school crowd that seems to linger around when I swing by to pick-up my order so I wouldn't ever eat-in but the owner/chef is one of the happiest/friendliest people you could find.  Great service...with a smile!!"
"Went here for lunch! It was amazing food! Perfect that it's right around the corner from my work. It very nice to have a friendly face greet you, makes the new experience even more enjoyable. The Cuban steak sandwich and the hibiscus lemonade are deliciousss! You have to try this place."
"Wow, empanadas and steak sandwich are absolutely delicious! Take time to visit Nini's, family owned and you will leave with a smile on your face. Their homemade lemonade is perfect on a summer day :)"
Nini's Deli has some of the best customer service I've witnessed--especially from the main proprietor Juan! Run by a local family that have lived in this area for a long time; they can direct you to lots of cool places in the area as well as the rest of Chicago! Really great Cuban sandwiches as well as vegetarian fare--you won't be disappointed!
"A true family owned and operated business!  the son runs the register, a cousin runs the food, and Pops is in the back cooking.. I was made to feel like I was at home.  I've never felt like that before.I went on an unseasonably warm winter day and wound up sitting in their outdoor patio and had the hibiscus lemonade and every type of empanada on the menu (including the special menu).  Amazing. It's a special thing to find a family owned restaurant operating at a high level of quality in a city overrun by franchises and chains.  Nini's has been one of my favorite spots in the city for the last 2 years."
"Everything was GREAT! From the service, to the food. I ordered the Cuban steak and cheese empanada and the hibiscus lemonade. It was fresh and AMAZING. I'm a big foodie so I'm very picky. The location was perfect and easy to get to. Everyone should try it"
"I follow Nini's Deli on Instagram and Twitter. I know it's social media and everyone is invited to the party, but it's like they love to send me saucy pictures of items on (and off) their menu. I couldn't take it anymore when I saw stuff chubby dreams are made of like the falafel tostada and Cuban grilled cheese, complete with mozzarella, platano maduro (sweet plantains), and guava jelly on some local fresh baked bread. Fact is, Nini's Deli is a simple mix of Cuban, Mexican, and Lebanese, and I was tempted to put my taste buds to the test. I took a trip down to Noble Park with my wife and a few friends to give this place an all around review. Chicago parking's a punk, but that's life. We walked into Nini's quaint corner restaurant and we were greeted with love. If the manager and co owner Juan Riesco's smile doesn't warm you up, then a mug of Nini's Deli's cafe con leche will. Before we ordered, Riesco asked if we had any food allergies or special diets so they could direct us to specific sections on the menu. I looked for that falafel tostada and couldn't find a proper description! It turns out that the food they feed to their followers through Instagram and twitter is stuff off of their ""special"" menu - I felt like a total champ. I grabbed a fresh cold hibiscus lemonade and took a seat. Within a few minutes, a server handed me my falafel tostada! So good. It was over once our food was served to us. We all scarfed down some classics - hot double steak sandwiches, falafel sandwiches, Cubanitos, that falafel tostada and some sides. The best part was the ""besito"" plate, fried batter with powdered sugar and guava jelly to finish off the meal. Dude, just bring your friends and come here for brunch. Highly recommended, just good food."
"One of the best and most lively places in Chicago. Best Cubano Sandwich, Coffee, Hisbiscus, even their water tastes great. Highly recommended!"
"When I go to a restaurant I look for good food, friendly people, and a nice atmosphere---Nini's has all of this and more. This place is super cute and run by the friendliest family! When I was there Juan was at the counter and was happy to help me and my friend figure out what to get. Everything is delicious and freshly made. Highly recommend the hibiscus lemonade and the empanadas! If you go here when the weather is nice the outdoor seating is perfect to enjoy some sun + tasty food and drink."
"Drove in all the way from Midway airport, for my first experience there, the food was incredible and definitely exceeded my expectations! My sandwich was so tasty. Also had some platanos and they were sooo delicious, I'm a sucker for platanos and these did not dissappoint! Also the churros may have possibly been the crunchiest, most delicious churros I've ever had.  The ambiance of the place was so welcoming and friendly. Also, if you're lucky enough, you'll be able to meet Juan the sweetest cook I've ever met! Super friendly and energetic person. Definitely worth the drive and I will definitely be coming here whenever I can!"
Very friendly and welcoming business!Empanadas are soooo tasty.  I love the yummy plantains!  And my favorite- the dessert empanada- warm apples and peanut butter!  Pure heaven!  My eyes rolled to the back of my head as I ate it!!
"Ask for the chicken, egg, and cheese wrap!   It's not on the menu, but it should be.  Awesomeness"
"Ninis is a gem, it is our go to spot in this neighborhood, and the second you step in here you'll understand why. The staff are incredibly friendly and want you to have the best possible experience, and it's a family operation so you have dad in the back concocting delicious Cuban fare, from the classics to the unique.I'm telling you that the media noche is a must, you'll feel like you're in Havana... Or at least Miami. And don't skip desert because the sweet empanadas are delicious."
"I had been coming here for awhile years ago but never reviewed. What a shame. Son and dad team who slam and cram the Chicago heads with delicious sandwiches and their signature Hibiscus tea. You need to come in here and become a patron. You owe it to yourself. Nice open inviting space, not much in the way of parking but I found a spot real close. I recommend the Cuban Steak sandwich with avocado and cheese. SO good. Instead of Burger baron, come here and get something a little bit healthier and whole lot tastier."
"Fantastic!I would start by saying that if you haven't been here, you are missing out.I have been here a few times, and completely recommend el cubanito (my favorite sandwich), and the chicken empanadas. The food is just heavenly! For drinks I would recommend the hibiscus lemonade- very refreshing, and if you are a coffee lover you should get a cortadito or cafe con leche.The food presentation is one of my favorite things about Nini's. Great mugs and mason jars. I also like the interior design of Nini's - simple and cute. The distribution of the seating area is nice, they have wooden booths perfect to go and have a good meal with friends, and there are smaller tables for two people, and an extra area next to the window with stools.If there's something that makes me come back to a restaurant is its atmosphere (besides the food); Nini's staff is welcoming and friendly. You can tell that people who work here love and enjoy what they do, because is reflected on the food and service. That's why I believe the place attracts such a great crowd. Last, but not least, they usually have Cuban music playing, which gives an extra touch to all the awesomeness mentioned before.You rock, Nini's!"
"I've been going to Nini's since 2012, when I got a job working down the street.  I remember when they had a small grocery store in with the deli.  I miss the Chai Cola, and the snickers ice cream bars....anyway.I have been blessed and privileged to have tried everything on this menu.  There isn't one thing that I dislike at all.  Even the coffee is good, and I don't like coffee.For first timers and vegetarians I highly suggest their El Cubanito sandwich, and the hibiscus lemonade.  Check their facebook page or instagram to see how beautiful the lemonade is.  The Empanadas are amazing, and should be tried as well.  From a steak, to a veggie, and a sweet empanada.  The sweet empanadas are apple and peanut butter with powder sugar sprinked on them.  For the more daring I would try the Cuban PB&J.  The PB&J has plantains in it, and the jelly is their home made Guava jelly.  That jelly is so good you could eat a jar full.There are plenty of other sandwiches to choose from.  They have everything from a Falafel sandwich to the Kitchen Sink.  What everyone should know is they have Gluten free bread, and it tastes fantastic.My favorite item on the menu is the Ropa Vieja, and my favorite on the Secret Menu is the Cuban Burrito.  Though you should ask about the Joseph platter.  It's another heavenly dish that is available on the Secret Menu.One last thing I want to mention are the churros.  You can't go wrong with their churros that are rolled in cinnamon, and sugar.  With the drizzled guava jelly on them.  They are perfect on a cold rainy spring or fall day to help pick up your mood.The other great thing about Nini's is how friendly it is.  You are always going to get a smile there, and feel the friendly atmosphere.  It's because of the good food, and friendliness that this is my favorite deli in all of Chicago.  I could eat breakfast, lunch, and dinner there if my wallet would permit me."
"Ninis Deli is the a great restaurant , the sandwiches are great and tasty , always fresh and up to date with  the culture of food :) best ropa vieja sandwich I have tasted :) The staff is great , always friendly and they all seem to love their job :) The atmosphere Is modern and fun to be there , It is also a family oriented restaurant , it's  a great place to drink coffee and hang out :)"
"Great place, from the people behind the counter to the food served. I see a lot of people complaining bout the prices, it's Chicago? There's a lot worse. The sandwiches are amazing & fill you up, coffee is great..well worth it.  Understandably everyone is entitled to their own opinion .. But those who haven't checked it out.. Go check it out & review it & your own choice!"
"DELI-IGHTThis is a great Mom and Pop joint located on a side street surrounded by a neighborhood.  It is kind of like a great hidden secret and you can tell from all of the amazing reviews you will read here about Nini's Deli.  This place does not benefit from a busy street but rather on great hometown neighborhood relations.The owner is a nice guy and he was really nice to let me try a few things before I settled in on my sandwich. l was really interested in the Ropa Vieja but I was not quite sure how that would be on a sandwich.  I finally settled on going with the Falafel Sandwich and wow was I amazed.This was probably one of the best Falafel's I have had in a while...it was really good and it worked on the sandwich.  They were out of the side I wanted, so I went with the potato salad.  The owner also threw in a side of the Tabolui Salad too.  Everything was really good and fresh.I really loved the space...it felt like you were eating at someone's house and not at a storefront on Noble Street.  The prices are great and if you happen to be in the neighborhood and you haven't tried this place then you must stop on in for a friendly chat and a great meal."
"Who is writing all these 5 star reviews?  My mind is legitimately blown.  Good ups for Nini's I guess.  (I live a block away and have now been about 8 times in 2 years)I had the same long wait experience again earlier this week.  Stopped in and waited over 15 minutes for the person in front of me just to order.  I wasn't even acknowledged by the owner, so I left.  It's just unacceptable for a corner deli to take 15 minutes JUST TO ORDER.  I want to grab and go.I really want this place to be great... it just isn't.  The food is average and the service (while with a smile) is not too good either.  Damn you Nini's!  Please be better!"
"I was introduced to Nini's by a friend and thoroughly enjoyed my experience. I had the Cuban steak with avocado along with the cafe con leche and it was all very good. I didn't know you can add a shot of espresso to the cafe con leche so I'll have to try that next time. All in all, this place is cute, the workers are friendly, and the food is delicious."
This place is amazing awesome service and even better the food. The media noche is my favorite and the empanadas are amazing. Definitely get the lemenade with your meal ties in perfectly. Love this place glad I finally got to come definitely my favorite Cuban around.
"This is a cute little family-owned cafe nestled in the west town neighborhood. The owner (who is the NICEST) who took my order explained that the food is Cuban, Mexican, and Lebanese-inspired. He offered me a sample of the cafe con leche which convinced me into getting my own for the road- delicious!! For food I got the Media Noche which was a cuban-inspired sandwich with turkey, ham, Swiss, fried plantains, pickles and mustard. It has incredible flavor with the sweet plantains, tangy mustard, and crunchy pickles. Yum! I ate the entire sandwich and plan to go back for more very soon."
"Just happened to drive by today and looked it up on Yelp.  The positive reviews were enough for me to double park and head in for same sandwiches to go.  I ordered two Cuban Steak with Avocado to go.  It was $10 a sandwich and they were well worth it.  The sandwiches were huge, the meat was tasty, and the bread was fresh.  The people behind the counter were super nice.  I think this might be one of those sweet hidden neighborhood gems.  I'll go back to try a few other things for sure.  And if everything else is good i'll bump up my review to 5 stars."
"Soo Good! I got the Cuban Steak Sandwich, a Steak empanada, and a hibiscous lemonade drink."
"So glad to have made it all the way to nini's deli! first of all the staff was so nice and lovely! The food was delicious and really tasty! We got to taste the veggie empanadas and the veggie sliders (with plantain instead of bread), but I would recommend the empanadas as it was soooo good (the sliders too, but not as tasty!). Then we tried the ""El cubanito"" (with plantain and black beans, for vegetarians) and the Cuban steak, both were so good and filling! After that, even though our bellies were full we had to try the Cuban Besitos ( freshly fried tortilla chips with homemade guava jelly, sooooo good, and the churros were so tasty!!!!!!)I would also recommend you trying the hibiscus lemonade, it's worth it!!!!!"
"Sandwiches are ok, nothing too crazy. A bit too expensive for standard ingredients $9 for a ham egg and cheese and $4 for 1 empanada. It's good for coffee and appetizers, too expensive for someone looking for a quick lunch."
"Between the cigars, sexy salsa dancing, and the sandwiches you can sure plead a case for wanting to visit Cuba. Unfortunately due to government regulations doing so is about as complicated as the Kennedy-era embargo. Fortunately for those of us Chicagoans who love the combination of steak, turkey, ham, cheese, and an egg omelet this little corner deli does an amazing version called the Kitchen Sink. It's massive and for under 10 bucks while the lighter eater can do one of the smaller options at about half the price. Honestly though just get the Kitchen Sink cause really...who doesn't like leftovers?If you're anywhere in this hood and hop on the Yelp app don't dismiss Nini's on account of having a light number of reviews. They're definitely worth a stop off the beaten path."
"There is nothing bad I can say about this place! All of the empanadas are delicious, especially with the green sauce. Nini's makes the best falafel in the city. It's also made to order so it comes nice and hot. Actually, everything is made to order. This is not a fast food joint, Nini's is a chill spot where you are treated like family. You come to Nini's for a real local, Chicago experience. The only thing better than the food, is the customer service. Juan and Meli are so friendly and always willing to answer any of your questions.How can I forget the Cuban steak sandwich! It's very filling and the French bread is delicious!"
"First time there with my wife today and loved it! I loved how the place is very well thought out and designed beautifully. Very welcoming, and the customer service was great. The food was great as well, we shall be returning"
"Great local neighborhood spot. Friendly service and was greeted with a smile. The food here is excellent. I brought my parents over for lunch and they loved it. We feasted on veggie sliders, black bean soup, green house salad, and empanadas. For dessert we enjoyed churros. This place is affordable and tasty!"
"The perfect neighborhood spot that's also worth a trek.Great food, reasonable prices, and the friendliest service."
"Details about this place are unnecessary. Everything here is delicious. The only complaint, in my opinion, is those $3 churros. Lower it to $1 and you have a deal. Delicious and super friendly. The Kitchen Sink sandwich is good for 2 meals. **ALERT** It's very dangerous to live so close to this place. I could eat here every day."
Five star service & food! This place was delicious. I tried something totally new - the veggie slider - and now I'm hooked! I can't wait to try the other items and definitely need to try the hibiscus tea. Can't wait to check this place out soon :)
"I don't know why Yelp deleted my original review, but here it is again. AMAZING! If you have not been to Nini's Deli, you are missing out big time. For starters, the food is finger-licking good! I have been there a few times, and would recommend my favorite sandwich, el Cubanito, and also, the mouthwatering chicken empanadas. If you are a coffee drinker you have to try a cortadito (cuban espresso), and cafe con leche. They also make a very refreshing hibiscus lemonade! I've always believed that a restaurant's atmosphere sets the stage. The staff is always nice and friendly, and I think that's why the restaurant attracts such a good crowd. If well, you don't attend this place with friends, you are most likely to end up making new ones talking to the people next table. They usually have playing cuban music, which gives it an extra touch to all these awesomeness mentioned before. Last, but not least, the deli is clean, and interior design is neat. Nice wooden booths, and tables for all party sizes, and a small area next to the window with stools. Food and beverages presentation is also one of my favorite things about Nini's; great mugs and mason jars, plastic food baskets with checkerboard paper. Oh, and how could I forget the light green lamps! Way to go Nini's."
"Great neighborhood place to grab your coffee and very well done egg and steak Cuban sandwiches. FAR BETTER than anything you get at those chain of fast food restaurants. Whoever which the 'S' in 'Fast Food' was clever. This is a family-owned restaurant that needs more friendly people that are truly glad to see you and pleased to serve you. uncertain if Yelper' 'Johnny W,' has any real taste buds, but I know good food when I taste it. And, I've been all over Miami and Latin America with family?y and recipes from Mexico. Remember, don't put the met to your happiness in someone else's pocket....just get out and try it for yourself. Good people, great food...EXCELLENT SERVICE!!! If something isn't done to your liking, just tell them...they are more than happy to please the customer....something you rarely find elsewhere. Above all service is key....and they have this down better than most 5 star restaurants. Tell Juan Georgie sent you!!!"
"friendly and fast service, and delicious food. The Steak, egg, and cheese was so good! A side of cafe con leche and it was the perfect brunch."
love everything in Ninis Deli is so good nothing compares to them.Customer Service is amazing too provided by Juan Riesco and his dad they are awesome you won't regret tasting the Media Noche sandwich and also the Cubanito they are yummy.
"Met my partner here on a weekday night and hour before closing. Restaurant was a bit smokey when I walked in, probably from the grill, but all-in-all a good vibe. The man working the register was extremely helpful -- as we were first-time visitors -- and was very patient with our indecisiveness. (We couldn't help it, everything sounded so good!) We ended up ordering a Vegetarian Empanada, which was perfectly flakey and gooey, that green sauce it comes with though! Fantastic. We also couldn't pass up the Cuban Nachos, which was on special: green plantains with homemade guacamole on top. The guacamole is the best I've ever had -- the perfect amount of acid. Media Noche, was was a little on the sweet side, but tasty nonetheless. And my partner ordered the Falafel tostada. The falafels were a little too dense for my liking, but my partner seemed to enjoy it."
"With so many positive reviews of this place, I thought I should give it a try.  I ordered a steak cubano and media noche to go. Maybe I'm just not a sandwich person, but the steak cubano wasn't as good as I had expected- the steak lacked flavor.  The media noche was pretty good.  I won't completely write this place off, though.  At some point I may come back to try their other sandwiches.   Very friendly service!"
Nini's Deli has been a hidden gem and a favorite go-to spot of mine. I tend to take friends there often who have never been. The secret menu is something I often keep tabs on by following their instagram page :) The service is so friendly and the food is fresh and amazingly satisfying!  It's a must to always grab a hibiscus lemonade and or a coffee drink.  Nini's has my heart for sure!  The family takes much pride in their business and it shows through with the brightest light and the BEST food!
"Great service! Staff was very friendly. Tried the steak and egg sandwich w/ avocado..it was good, a little pricey for a sandwich.  The mind blowing part was the sweet empanada (drooling just thinking about it), peanut butter was gooing out when I cut it in half(I LOVE PEANUT BUTTER). Also had the churro which was also perfect! Cafe con leche was a bit strong but nothing a little sugar can't cure.  :)"
"Chicken Empanadas though must order to start your meal then get you that Cubanito with Habiscus Lemonade and thank yourself later! Good vibes, good service!"
Never had a Cuban sandwich before so have nothing to compare it to.  My son had the ropa viaja and I had their steak sandwich.   Very yummy.Family owned friendly and casual.  Will go again.  Beats the pants off any chain sandwich place hands down.
"The best deli ever!!!! I love the atmosphere! Juan is very good at what he does, but nothing beats the FOOD! Omg! The cuban sandwich is off the chain! Make sure to ask to add the avocado, it makes it complete! Not to mention the coffee! During summer they serve a home made Hibiscus Lemonade that will rock your taste buds! If you need a dose of wake me up shots, NiNi's is the place to get one, 1 shot will knock you off your socks! Their breakfast sandwiches are works of wonder as well! Tostones, let me leave it there! The service is fast, price is right. You won't be disappointed! Also, do not forget to get dessert after! Will definitely be back again!!! Thank you NiNi's!"
"Just okay food. Had the steak sandwich, steak empanada, and rice & beans.  Apparently they have specials that they've posted on instagram.  We asked about the specials.  They refused to tell us and said to check out our social media instead for that ""inside scoop"".  Flavorless food was ordered and provided.  If you want a tasty Cuban Sandwich/food for roughly the same price point, go to Cafecito or any other Cuban Joint."
"I became friends with the family who owns Nini's before I visited the restaurant, which is what encouraged me to make the trek to check it out. This ended up being some of the most delicious food from a deli I have ever had! I've had some of their sandwiches, empanadas, falafel in a pita, the churros, coffee, and the hibiscus drink. Everything made here is delicious and top quality. Even though I don't live nearby, I'm happy to make the commute when I have the time. Of course, the customer service is as GREAT as the food!"
"I sometimes wish this place wasn't so close to me because some weeks I go there multiple times.....why?  Because of the great food and the great people behind the name.  I started going here back when it was a grocery store and I think you could also get sandwiches.  Now, they offer Cuban and Lebanese food which is amazing, affordable and so DELICIOUS.First of all, they have my all time favorite, the cafecito.  Secondly, they have cuban sliders which are a little piece of heaven between two plantains.  Thirdly, they have an awesome guava sauce which goes well with everything.  Ok, I can go on and on, they have churros, which are heavenly.  They also have empanadas which change but I have yet to try one that I haven't liked.  Pretty much everything is good here and worth a taste.  Go back for the food and support this awesome family!"
awesome service awesome food. Excited to go back.
Great food! Excellent twist on a cuban food and the staff makes its feel like home! A definite staple in this neighborhood!
Nini's Deli is AMAZING! Food is great & made with love! Customer Service is awesome. Always attentive to the customers needs. I tell everyone I know about them! I even have my Cousin drive from Island Lake just to go to Nini's Deli!!!  Love this place!!
Cafe Con Leche with a shot of espresso. YUM! My favorite coffee around!
"If I could eat Nini's every single day, all day!! Every menu item is delicious and the family who owns this place are the nicest people ever. The empanada's are my favorite. there's a sauce that goes with it that you dip it in that's so freakin flavorful. and the outside is always crunchy and fresh. I also love the side of rice and beans. YOU MUST get the hibiscus lemonade, picture worthy and delicious .Love you Nini's!!"
Went here while working on the ambulance. Nini's is absolutely wonderful! The place is clean and welcoming. And not only did they have some yummy looking options but 90% of the menu can be made gluten free! Talk about celiac heaven! I got the ropa vieja and steak slider... Both are to die for. They get gluten free bread from a completely gf bakery and the slider was made with fried plantains (YUM!)Thanks so much Nini's I shall be back for more!
A great vegetarian option to have in the neighborhood. Super nice and always fast but never rushed. Lucky to be close enough to walk. Definitely becoming a lunch time staple.
"Nini's is a spot I am proud to have in my neighborhood. Like Noble Square itself, Nini's is: small, inviting, friendly, unpretentious, and full of surprises. I try to make it there once every week or two for my favorite the delicious Media Noche, or I'll mix it up and get the Ropa Vieja with Chicken, or the classic Cuban Steak. I've never been remotely disappointed with either the quality, or the quantity of food and neither will you. Furthermore, the friendliness of the staff/ family and the positive vibes they send are something special. It is not too often that I walk into a restaurant or cafe and feel like the staff truly cares about my experience. Nini's is a welcome exception. If you want delicious Cuban and Lebanese inspired food (with Veg and gluten-free option) run by a wonderfully friendly family, go to Nini's!"
"Love this place for lunch or a quick breakfast in the neighborhood.  It is a mixture of Cuban and Lebanese food to match the family that runs the restaurant. Very friendly staff and tasty food. I first had the cuban steak sandwich which was tasty with tender steak and crispy bread, excellent sandwich. The Ropa Viejo (chicken) was good, chicken was a hair on the dry side but the sandwich was good overall.  The empanadas (veggie and chicken) were both great.The interior was clean and inviting and the food came out quick and hot. The only downside at all I saw during two visits was that the ordering can be a bit slow because the staff is so friendly (not a problem for me but if you are in a hurry or uptight it might be).Overall a great spot for lunch and we will be back many times."
"YOU GUYS! I will not stop until every single person roaming the planet has inhaled (because it is what will happen after you simply taste your first bite) a sandwich from here. SIMPLY AMAZING only sums up the friendliness of the staff. FANTASTIC would describe the DELICIOUS Hibiscus Lemonade that was poured in front of my eyes in a mason jar. I ordered a Steak Empanada as an appetizer, and HOLY! I don't believe in anything else. I was blown away. The meat was so tender and perfectly seasoned. The cheese was nice and melted. The Empanada was fried goodness. Literally food for the Gods. I was already feeling full, but the nice lady who brought me my Cuban Steak Sandwich to my table that overlooked Noble Street, smiled as she dropped off this sandwich that was piled high with ingredients and smells that made me forget that I had just admitted defeat 14 seconds before. I took a bite of this feast on bread, and have never been the same. I am in the process of making up a word to describe what I tasted. Literally, no word I. The english language can describe what I felt. I devoured that sandwich. It was the best thing ever and have not been able to shut up ever since. Seriously, try it, and come back to thank me. Also, really great prices! I paid less than $20 for the lemonade, the appetizer, the sandwich, and churros as dessert."
The ropa vieja sandwich and felafel salad are to die for! LOVE IT! Wish they were open later so that I can come for dinner more often. Definitely a place we go to when Im off during the day :) and the owner is a sweetheart so helpful and so sweet!  Sucha homey cozy atmosphere!
GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS!  no can be as excited as I.... and they are yummy options!the service is outstanding...as if they remember who you are everytime!  it really doesn't get any better for a neighborhood place.
"I'm hooked.  One visit is all it took.  Two sandwiches (shared with Aurore) and a coffee - regular, not cafe con leche - and I know I will be back.Yet, it is as much for the service and warm, congenial atmosphere offered up by the owners as it is for the delicious sandwiches we ate.  An idealic neighborhood spot, tucked on the corner of an unassuming part of town (close to two schools, churches, a couple of parks- this part of Noble Square is a nice representation of a Chicago residential neighborhood) you will find a storefront run by really friendly and gracious hosts, who just happen to serve up some tasty food and offer staple grocery items.Think: a lot of Cuban-inspired sandwiches, but with a strong Lebanese influence.  No pork (all Halal here!), but the flavors work and match up with what you expect from Cuban sandwiches.We shared a Cuban PB&J (sweet plantains, peanut butter and a guava paste jam in between two perfect pieces of Cuban bread) and a Cubanito (eggs, cheese, plantains, black beans - all on that delicious Cuban bread).  A great breakfast for sure!"
Had the best empañadas here. I would come again over the weekend to try there weekend specials. But overall amazing place. Love the décor and people there are very hospitable. If you are vegan eat the apples and peanut butter empañadas and their black bean tostada. So good!
"I've lived in Noble Square for 3 years, but I just heard about this place via Instagram. I decided to pop in around lunch on a Saturday to check it out. First off, it's a great looking place. It's a clean, updated place in with a nice patio and interior. The guy at the counter was awesome, really nice and asking questions about how I heard about it. The place has been around about 3 years but getting involved in social media has helped a lot he said. I had chicken empanadas, a churro and a hibiscus lemonade. Everything was fresh and really good, like really really good. I'm only disappointed I didn't start coming here sooner!"
"Came back to Nini's and tried their Steak, Egg and Cheese Sandwich. Soooo good. I paired it with a hibiscus lemonade, which hit the spot (perfect for summer). Juan makes great food and he is so hospitable! I visited with a group and our waters were constantly refreshed. We were so well taken care of. Nini's staff matches the atmosphere, both are welcoming and charming."
"For some reason Yelp took down my review, so I'm posting it again! I will be heard, Yelp! Condensed version of this review: NINI'S DELI = CUBAN SANDWICH HEAVEN Full review: I'm not really one to wax poetical about a sandwich, but their ""media noche"" sandwich is the stuff of dreams. Let me paint a picture for you: crunchy bread, just the right amount of meat and melty swiss cheese then (be still my beating heart) generous slices of sweet, fried plantains. *swoon*I'm also in love with their house-made hibiscus lemonade. It's sweet, it's tangy, and it's absolutely beautiful. The hot pink hibiscus floats on top of the pale yellow lemonade so it's also a real treat for the eyes!  Other favorite menu items include the black beans and rice which are simple, hearty, and tasty; the massive and unbelievably yummy""cubanito""; and the vegetable empanada. Also a note to those on special diets or with food allergies: they are always happy to make adjustments to menu items (for example, they just rolled out some surprisingly delicious gluten-free bread that you can substitute if you feel so inclined). Not only will you get amazing food when you come to Nini's, but you'll be greeted and served by an awesome dude named Juan (seriously one of the friendliest guys you'll ever meet). He and his family have worked hard to make the cafe beautiful, warm, and inviting. Why are you still reading this? Put down your computer and go!"
"This place is really cute. Nice music playing in the background. Cool and very friendly cashier took my order. I had the steak sandwich. It was okay. Not bad but not great either. I was a but disappointed by that. Also had the churro with the guava sauce. This was pretty delicious. Could use a little less cinnamon sugar on the outside, but otherwise very fresh and tasty.  I'll probably be back to try the other sandwiches. Free street parking doesn't hurt and to have another food option near my job is always a plus."
"Great place for a quick eat. A varied menu catered to all tastes, among them was the vegetarian Cubanito; fried plantains, an omelette, American cheese & black beans. Good food! Friendly service! Definitely worth a visit."
"True to it's yelp reviews, the owner's son was working the register and was extremely friendly. Eager to offer suggestions and elaborate on the menu. I had the steak sandwich on gluten free bread. Phenomenal. He let me try the hummus which was delicious and the plantains were absolutely perfect. Their menu is simple, yet remains interesting and I am looking forward to trying the falafel sandwich. This is a well run, clean, friendly, delicious establishment. I love my neighborhood!"
"I have NO IDEA where all these 5 star ratings are coming from? Im assuming from the young family friend fan base? Anyway..SERVICE. Ive been there 3 times, each time the son, a plump fellow has been there and has absolutely no professional restaurant etiquette. You hear him hollering at his family and friends...and its a small space, guess he feels the need to inflate a small ego? His loud presence reminded me of my Italian\Puerto rican cousins. It was rude and annoying to say the least. As a customer who just stopped in based off yelp reviews, i was expecting friendly service at least, but it seems very clique oriented. FOOD. Flavorless, lacks authenticity, portions are off for the price. The food is such a weird cross between trying to be authentic cuban..? But then you have sirracha on each table, and bland everything. My empanadas had no flavor, no salt, no nothing to make it special or represent a good taste, seriously, and oil just leaked everywhere. My empanadas from bomba in Humboldt park dont even gush that much oil everywhere! Greasy a bit. IF AT THAT. The sandwichs are edible, not anything special or memorable. And what makes this place a deli...? Its so far off from what they want it to be.the only thing they got going for them is their hibiscus lemonade, and thats ONLY if.YOU CAN APPRECIATE such drinks without sugar. Refreshing for my palette, but was bland for both my boyfriend and mom. cafecito near Columbia college off congress HAS WAY BETTER FOOD. ITS AMAZING AND AUTHENTIC, HAS FLAVOR. ..and that says alot for some random cuban joint placed in such a funky area. Or 90 miles to cuba, is BOMB, has true roots and flavor. Even food trucks deliver better taste than the stuff at this place.Overall this place was a HUGE disappointment. The young folks running the place seem to have their hands better equipped in marketing communication arts. Maybe they should pursue a career in that? But the food just isnt up to par nor is the service etiquette. I often used yelp on my phone for good local spots when adventuring the city. But after my last attempt there, i had to open an.account to fully express that this place sucked and the ratings are either yuppies with no authentic taste buds, or friends of friends of these guys. Neighbor and family love probably. Just not worth your time.**LOL btw, i love how there hasnt been a review for like a month, and then here comes mine, followed by some chick addressing everything i said but in a positive light. #friendbasedbuisness #notprofessional #gointoadvertising"
Delicious food from a really pleasant family-run sandwich shop. So friendly!
"Family operated by the nicest people I've ever met, literally. I'm convinced that it's their love that makes the food beyond exceptional. I have yet to have something here that I didn't absolutely love. I can't even recommend what to eat here, because it's all awesome. Their vegan and gluten free options are amazing, and they're always bringing new, cool stuff into the mix. Nini's is perfect, but somehow they manage to improve every time I go in there. This place is one of Chicago's best kept secrets. Well, actually, I dunno....they've been pretty crowded every time I go in there lately so the secret must be out :PMy only complaint - I wish they were open on Sundays!!!!!! :'("
"came here for lunch. friendly staff, decent food. nothing amazing but above average."
We've been here three weekends in a row right now. SO GOOD. The hibiscus lemonade and coffee are so great here. Wonderful steak sandwiches and churros. My favorite are the chicken empanadas. These are perfect and the sweet sauce to dip them in tastes awesome. Service is seriously as nice as it could ever be. There are no people nicer than the people that work at Nini's and that makes me want to keep coming back. That and the great food and drink. I just love everything about this place.
"Friendly service, great sandwiches, empanadas, and coffee.  Wish it was in my neighborhood!  I recommend stopping by for lunch!"
"This is the third time coming to NiNi's and the food and drinks are amazing my favorite is the chicken empanadas and the coffee con leche is so good. Great place to go, highly recommended."
"I don't know how I lived in the area for over a year before trying this place.  Honestly I'm not into any of the steak sandwiches but I don't like steak in general. It's not them, it's me. FWIW I got a Cuban steak sandwich for my brother and he loved it.  I had El Cubanito and it was so damn good. I add avocado to most of the sandwiches bc I love avocdao and it's $1.  Once you add the avocado I guess the sandwich price is a little steep but these are freaking huge.  My boyfriend couldn't finish the whole thing and my brother did but he eats a lot.  I at least get two meals out of it.  I didn't care for the sweet empanada but I still love this place. It can get kind of busy during peak hours.  Also, their Instagram account posts ""secret""  menu items that look so incredible."
"One of the best hidden Cuban places in the city.  The food is delicious, the staff is super friendly and helpful, and to top it all off they have vegetarian items that are delicious even to those that are carnivores.  I had a sandwich with no meat and it was pure heaven.  Needless to say I have found my go to spot for lunch on Wednesdays"
"Good food & great family owners - my favorite kind of place.  My sister & I stumbled upon this gem a while back and have taken many friends to eat there.  They have gone through a few interior designs and use to carry a variety of organic/fair trade pantry items.  Delicious food,  friendly family owners, and bright space with good music --- amazing every time!Street parking in the area is a little congested with homes and the school but you can usually find a spot along a side street."
"We just moved to Chicago and I immediately started looking for yummy ethnic vegan food.  I stumbled upon Nini's while exploring some side streets, and it is perfect! The atmosphere is super chill and welcoming. Juan is the sweetest guy ever and already remembers us after only a few visits.  He also treats our toddler to free apple juice. It's a small, family-run joint, and at the same time it's a nice open space with comfy benches and tables. Every time I go, I just want to relax and hang out for a bit. My son has fun playing with the dominoes on the table.On top of the wonderful service, the food is amazing! They have great vegan options and they are enthusiastic about new and exciting menu items.  Definitely try the empanadas and the delicious dessert Besitos de Cuba!I highly recommend Nini's if you are looking for delicious food at very reasonable prices, and a vibe like your friend's parents are cooking for you while you hang out after school."
"Steak egg and cheese = true love.  Also,  Juan is the nicest guy ever.  These people really care about their food and their customers."
Excellent Cuban cafe/grocer. The cafe con leche is excellent. The sandwiches are all cheap and very filling. The steak egg and cheese is enough to full you up for a long days work. Then only thing better than the food are the owners. Since my first coffee they have been nothing but sweethearts. Good small selection of groceries as well. Go have a coffe and play some dominos.
"Go out of your way to eat here!  Breakfast or lunch - Family owned and it shows - Greeted by one of the family members that was as great as the food.  Had Hibiscus lemonade and the steak, egg, cheese Cuban Sammie - hit the spot!!"
"One of my favorite delis of all time.The place is run by an incredibly gracious family, the cuban fusion chef is actually Cuban/Lebanese, and the food is delicious + affordable.I got a sandwich called ""Media Noche"" (midnight in spanish in case you wanna know), which was an awesome combination of ham, turkey, cheese, and fried plantains (omg so good).  They then top the sandwich off with some pickles and mustard to widen the taste palate.  I also can't forget to mention that they saw me struggling to refuse the 99 cent extra avocado and wound up including it in the sandwich for free when I didn't even ask!To make these guys stand out even more, they included a free dessert for our first visit!TL;DR - Delicious fusion food, do not fear the plantain, some of the nicest restaurant staff that I have ever met."
"We fell in love with this place! My hubby and I were in the neighborhood yesterday, and we happened to choose this place which was around the block! What a pleasant surprise! I had Media Noche and hibiscus lemonade and he had steak sandwich (not sure about the name), oh my god, what a delicious treat! Everything was extremely delicious, but I can't forget those fried bananas in my sandwhich. It's so bad we don't live in chicago, so I don't what we'll do when craving for those sandwhiches! I also had to mention I was fascinated with the friendly service. It was our first time but everybody seemed to know each other. We'll definitely make an another trip!"
"I'm leaving my first ever yelp review here because this place is YUMMY and the people that work there are awesome! I recommend the el cubanito sandwich which is my usual there. Gooey cheese wrapped in egg, black beans, and fried plantains all held together with warm crusty bread.... So delicious. :) You need to try it!!"
"What a beaut of an independent business. Family owned and operated, they are super friendly and I loved my whole experience there.They were out of the special of the day when we arrived for a late lunch, but they still had some of the sauce left over and offered some to sample and some to pour over our meal. They have great vegan and vegetarian options and have a small but widely varied grocery of sorts with tons of non perishables and frozen/refrigerated items.The food was delicious, fresh, and served up quickly. Highly recommended!"
I read the reviews here and I have been meaning to try this place for a while now. It really lived up to the expectations of all these five star reviews. I had the Ropa Vieja sandwich and it was delicious. The beef was soft and juicy which in other places isn't always the case. The staff was very friendly. I am definitely going back.
"NOM NOM NOM.  After walking past this place on my way to work for like 4 months now, I finally stopped in the other Saturday morning.  I shared a Cubanito with another person, and we each had an iced cafe con leche.  The prices for the sandwiches were very reasonable, especially considering how humongous they are.  We shared one and it was MORE than enough for two hungry girls on a Saturday morning.  The coffee was great but it was pricey compared to cuban coffee at some of my other favorite cuban restaurants (cafecito).  That said, Cafecito isn't on my walk to work anymore, so...The sandwich was delicious!  They have a little grocery store also.  In general, very friendly ambiance and staff.  It was an enjoyable experience from all sides.  Very happy to patronize this business!"
I've been coming here for sandwiches for a couple of years now. Today I walk in and the friendly staff has me try a new menu item. Ceviche empanadas served with a tamarind salsa. Talk about phenomenal!!!! Fresh ceviche perfectly seasoned with a crispy but perfectly done crust! I'm hooked for life on this place!!!
Excellent food and friendly staff. Cuban slider is amazing. Ropa Vieja sandwich us also really good. We will be coming back to this hidden little gem.
"so great! i'm thrilled to have found a spot with gluten-free options (amazing french bread, locally made). easy parking, fair prices, accommodating and friendly staff. get the hibiscus lemonade!"
"What a lovely place! We live right down the street and I think it's time for us to go to Nini's more often. We spent a perfect saturday afternoon drinking cafe con leche on their cute patio. It was just perfect. Everything that I've eaten here is delicious. I usually get the El Cubanito for breakfast. The blend of eggs, black beans, plantains and avocado is unbelievably tasty. I also love the fact that it's a family establishment and they seem to genuinely love their restaurant. It's recently gone through a couple of renovations and it looks beautiful! I have nothing bad to say at all. I love this place and I think it's the ""neighborhood gem"". Keep up the good work."
"The friendly service at Nini's is unreal and the food is equally good. Loved the pulled chicken empanada, I added sriracha a++ Tried the churros that come with powdered sugar and I believe guava sauce and it was probably the best churro I've ever had. We hung out here for 2 hours because it's just that cozy and welcoming. Worth the travel if you're not from the neighborhood."
"Nini's is a little hidden gem, but definitely worth a detour off Grand, Ashland or even Chicago.As soon as the boyfriend and I entered we were greeted heartily by the owner and offered samples. Most of their options looked appealing, but I decided to go with the plantain, guava and peanut butter sandwich because it sounded unique. It definitely was! The sandwich was also huge, and doubled as my lunch and dinner. Yea, when I said huge, I mean ginormous! I loved the free side of potato salad too. I can't wait to visit again and try some more of their vegetarian options."
"After passing this place dozens of times. I finally had the time to try my long anticipated cubanito sandwich. Loved everything about this place, the friendly customer service, the family runned atmosphere, the beautiful painting on the outside of the wall, the food. Everything is tip top about this place....I'm a huge sucker for any little storefronts that are family owned; it makes me feel as if I'm a valued customer with a at home kind of feel...this place definitely has that aura about it. Not to mention the food is extremely affordable, tasty, and filling portions. Im so full that im writing this review to avoid getting out of my car because I feel as if my pants will pop a button (chunky girl problems......)."
"This is truly a hidden gem.  Nini's is a really lovely spot with amazing sandwiches that are all Zabiha Halal, which is great because its really hard to find delis let alone cuban spots that use all Zabiha halal meats. The owners are super friendly and made me feel super welcome.  Juan and Jose were very helpful in explaining to me about the sandwiches I ordered.  I ordered the kitchen sink for me, the turkey pastrami for my wife, and the Cuban PB&J for my son.  The sandwiches were humongous and super delicious. I hope to make this a spot that we frequently visit and support.  I will definitely be telling all my friends about Nini's."
