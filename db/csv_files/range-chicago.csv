Range
"Precisely a 3.75.Came around 9:30am Sunday and place was pretty empty. I've passed by this place a number of times and it never seems busy at all which is a little worrisome, but the space always seemed inviting and am sure glad I stopped by. The name of the place is certainly indicative of the décor and atmosphere, which I found to be lovely and comfortable.I got the jalapeno sausage omelette and sis got portabella benedict. My omelette was quite tasty and jam packed with spinach and roasted onions, which I loved. The swiss cheese worked well with the dish. I just found the jalapeno flavor to be lacking. The accompanied lemon potatoes were pretty good. Sis enjoyed her benedict and it was unique to see the portabella serving as the English muffin. It was a nice and lighter take on a traditional benedict.Overall, our server was great and was really on top of things. I enjoyed the ambiance and food."
"Every year for Mother's Day, I take my mom out to a new restaurant. She loves it because it's generally the sort of place my dad would never go. He's pretty happy at maggianos or the Olive Garden. My mom and I, however, look for a little more in an evening out. When trying to decide where to take her, I looked at the menu for Range. I hadn't been before but when I saw Buffalo cauliflower on the menu I was sold. When I sent her the menu she didn't get past Buffalo cauliflower either before she, too, was sold. It didn't disappoint. Buffalo cauliflower will change your life. Someone needs to contact me immediately and tell me how to make it at home. The cauliflower isn't where the night ended, of course, and it will say everything we had was delicious. We ordered five or six different things and shared all of it. All together the evening was wonderful. Excellent food, excellent service, great ambiance, and very vegetarian-friendly.I went back last week to take a friend to brunch. I was excited to find they take reservations, which is nothing short of a miracle for brunch in this town. The brunch was also delicious I had a Benedict and I had a an apple omelette. It probably needed a bettee apples and cheese to egg  ratio, but it was good. My friend had carrot waffle Benedict. That was apparently pretty amazing, too. The bloody Mary's are great as well."
"Sad to see so many bad reviews. I went once and thought it was fantastic.They don't have outdoor seating, but the windows are practically floor to ceiling and open all the way out, so if you're seating at the front it's basically like being outside. Service was great. My husband and I asked for some type of interesting mocktails and the bartender really came through. Sometimes places mix up some juice and sprite and call it a mocktail (yeah... no) but here what we got was SO good.As far as food, honestly the only thing neither of us liked was dessert. We tried a chocolate thing (some cake thing) and the pavlova. I liked the pavlova, because I like pavlova. But the cake was just bad. Very dry and flavorless. But all the other food- appetizers, entrees, all delicious. Really really good.Great service, nice location, great food (I'll skip dessert next time though!). I'll definitely be back."
"4.5 stars It's been a while since I found a brunch spot that has me going all YAYYYY and eager to write a review. Firstly, the ingredients all taste so fresh but they don't overly charge! I got the baked eggs and toast which looked very simple on first glance but tasted out of this world. The toast is thickly cut, perfectly crispy and flaky on the outside and soft and creamy on the inside. I actually liked the fact that the flavor of the cheese didn't stick out. It blends in really well with the cream sauce. The yolk of the baked egg was 90% solid, 10% runny. This was the only thing I would've asked to be changed as I like runny yolk more. The small salad on the side is topped with a fantastic pear pomegranate vinaigrette which I wish I can bottle home. Of course on my second visit, they had changed a bit of their menu and removed the baked eggs and toast. I decided on the sweet potato waffle benedict which was pretty dang good as well. The waffles were a bit too hard but other than that, I really enjoyed the meal. Note: british bacon is like ham. Oh, and the lemon potatoes....MMM! A faint spritz and taste of lemon mixed in the potatoes, it's a fantastic combination I've never had before.Bonus: Spicy ketchup brought to the table!! An absolute must add to those potatoes or fries! Ambiance: SUPER cute and simple decorations on the inside very fitting for a restaurant that calls itself Range. Excellent and friendly service. Servers are quick, efficient, and they come by a few times during the meal to make sure everything is okay."
"Range has become the go to brunch spot for me and my cousins almost every weekend! I live in the Loop so I love getting up to Lincoln Park during the summers for a less crowded area and Range is such a hidden gem. The restaurant is located right across from one of the most beautiful (and largest!) trees in Lincoln Park and is easy to spot by its grassy green façade. The interior is what I would describe ""farmhouse chic"" with white washed wood, animal portraits, and bare bulb light fixtures. I love the cattle ear tag chandeliers that greet guests-very warm and inviting and clever as well! For your meal, start with the very very fresh squeezed grapefruit juice and coffee-both are amazingly flavorful. I love (and have had) almost all of the omelets. I think the parsnip one is my favorite as I love anything with parsnip in it and putting it in an omelet is such a fresh take on this vegetable. Range is very involved in using locally sourced ingredients and you really can taste the difference. Although I usually go to Range for brunch, I have been for dinner as well and have a great veggie burger! They have an impressive wine and creative cocktail list as well. I am sure I will be back to Range very soon and can't wait to try out their new and ever changing menu options."
"Range is a cute little brunch spot close to DePaul and downtown Lincoln Park. It is great for groups and takes reservations which was convenient when my family of 10 needed somewhere to go last Sunday. They offer something for everyone and breakfast and lunch options which always help. Everything is farm to table and has a unique and tasty flavor which we all enjoyed. I had the chance to try the poached portabella which was a lighter and great option. The other favorite at the table was definitely the chilequiles. We also ordered the French toast for everyone, I would not recommend this as it was more of a sweet bread than a French toast, I think we were all glad that none of us got it on our own!"
"Tried this place on a Sunday night with the family. We ordered pretty easy dishes - a couple flatbread pizzas and soups and salads. Our server totally forgot to bring my soup out with everyone else's first courses, and I think she forgot about our whole order, since it took over an hour to make these simple dishes (and the restaurant was pretty empty, so the kitchen couldn't have been slammed). When we finally got them, they were just okay. Nothing to rave about, and I probably won't go back."
"Buffalo cauliflower!  It's worth going to range just for this app.  I will order it every time I'm there.The rest of the food was also good, plus they have a  decent beer selection from local brewers.  I was surprised how easy it was to get a table on a Thursday night for dinner, it seems like range has been a more popular place for brunch but the dinner is also great."
This place consistently has delicious food and a great selection of local booze for cocktails. The burger is outstanding.
"Just skip this place. Came here last night for a birthday dinner and was not impressed at all. There were only about 4 people working the entire bar and restaurant which made for EPICALLY SLOW service. I tried asking for water three times and the server just breezed past me because she was too busy covering other tables. Several people asked for beers in our group and had to ask multiple times as well. The same thing happened when we ordered cheese curds- they forgot one order. The food itself, it tries too hard. It's incredibly unclear what sort of market the restaurant is trying to target. Are you trying to target foodies, paleo, gluten free or what? The dinner menu does not have clear direction, in my opinion. A bunch of us settled on the burger because it seemed like the most sensible choice after the lack luster cheese curds. Well, we could have put together a loaf of bread with all the extra ""bunness"" to this burger. I will even include a picture of that. The burger itself was small and was masked with a bunch of extra stuff to hide that. How do you screw up a burger?! Two other friends had the portobello mushroom and were sorely disappointed. It was an entire plate of arugula and one small coaster sized mushroom. We were joking about how meager the portion was! After several attempts at more water and beer, our server finally attempted to get the checks together. That was another challenge, we sat for about 15 minutes trying to get that organized because our server was confused about them. Needless to say, this place needs direction and work all around. Between the service and lack luster food, I say ""pass"""
"Sadly, I was disappointed. I have heard great things about Range, but recently they have changed the menu. Honestly, it seemed more like an upscale Applebees or TGI Friday's than something local and unique. I had a salad with roasted apples, caramel goat cheese, and beets. The portion was so small for how much it cost, and it was not anything super special. The staff was very kind, but they seemed distracted."
"JUST BAD all around.  Went there spur of the moment for dinner and was pleased to find a restaurant with pretty good reviews only 2 blocks from my last appointment because I was starving to death.At close to 8PM the dining room was completely empty and there were two parties in the lounge area. Not a good sign. Greeted by a server wearing what looked like what you wear to clean the garage. Not that this is a fashion review but c'mon the prices on the menu imply that you show up for work looking like you actually care about how  you represent the company. Ordered the WORST VEGGIE BURGER with a side of THE SADDEST MIXED GREEN SALAD IN THE CITY.The burger was flavorless, no seasoning and fell apart after one bite.  I swear I had to eat it like a sloppy joe.  The room temp/wilted salad drowning in grocery store dressing was a gooey mess.As I mentioned I was starving so I just had to suck it up.  BTW when the server came by once more to check on me OF COURSE IT WAS WHILE I HAD A MOUTHFUL AND COULD NOT RESPOND.  REALLY there are only 3 tables to look after? Not that I would have asked for a different item or even dessert.  If you have the nerve to place a PC OF CRAP for $12.00 on the menu then I seriously doubt you care about anything coming out of the kitchen."
"We went to Range for dinner one night and at first glance I wasn't sure I was going to enjoy the experience but I ended up being surprised by how good everything was.  We started off with the buffalo-butter cauliflower and the squash croquetas.  I didn't love either of these but I liked the squash better than the cauliflower.  To be fair -- I don't love cauliflower so I don't blame the restaurant.  For dinner I had the turkey sandwich without bacon.  It was awesome!  It's a huge sandwich that is made with real turkey meat (not deli meat which I'm not a fan of).  I loved that there was an egg on it which helped add some moisture to the sandwich.  The herb fries were also great and if you don't order something that comes with the herb fries, you should probably order some on the side.  Others at the table got the porkchop and the grit cake.  Everyone liked what they ordered so thought I didn't try their meals, I'll believe they were as good  as mine.  I also ordered the house rose which was very good and went nicely with my sandwich.We were celebrating some birthdays so we also got the pumpkin cheesecake which was delicious and a nice small portion which was fine because it's very rich.  I would definitely go back to Range but I'm not sure I could bring myself to order anything besides the turkey sandwich because it was that good!"
"I was so excited to try this place after hearing such rave reviews...so, on a sunny Saturday my husband and I walked on over & quickly scored a table for brunch. I was surprised to find the place mostly empty at noon on a such a beautiful day but considered ourselves lucky.  Especially since not long after our arrival, the place filled up nicely. We ordered the sweet potato eggs Benedict and a kale salad with chicken. Prices at this spot are super reasonable for such a cute place in Lincoln Park. Seriously, the ambience couldn't be cuter. Should you decide to visit, check out the chandeliers...super clever!I probably should have written this review while at the restaurant - I would have had plenty of time. The two dishes we ordered took just over 30 minutes to arrive. And, when they did, both lacked serious flavor. I felt worse for the couple who were seated at the table next to us. After 15 minutes without a single server acknowledging them, the woman asked a passing employee to send a server over - 10 minutes later, she walked to the hostess stand to ask again. Finally their waitress arrived with absolutely no acknowledgment of the delay.  Clearly, service wasn't a priority that day and it's a shame because the ambience couldn't be more charming."
"This place was so good that it's brought me out of my review hiatus!We loved the restaurant as soon as we walked in. It has such a nice vibe! The interior (and exterior) design is excellent. The atmosphere is comfortable, yet romantic. This would be a good place to go on a date, have a group dinner with friends, or to take your parents to! We sat in a cute little booth for two people, which had very comfortable seats, and were greeted right away by our friendly server, Brendan. We decided to order the pork doughnuts (5) and buffalo butter cauliflower (5) from the bar food menu to start. You get 3 little round balls of deliciousness for the pork doughnuts, which are covered with a tea-pepper citrus glaze and topped with wasabi peas. They are pretty tiny though, think half of a munchkin, and the pork flavor isn't that strong, but they were still good. The buffalo butter cauliflower dish was amazing!!! You should definitely get it. It hits the spot, and manages to be crispy, even. It's hard to believe that you're eating vegetables. Yum! I also got one of their speciality lemon drop cocktails (12) which was very strong. After our appetizers, they offered us a complimentary palate cleanser of a strawberry, hibiscus, and basil sorbet. It was delicious!For our entrees, we went with one medium dish and one large. For the medium, we got the bacon flat bread (11) which comes with caramelized-pepper bacon, Wisconsin buttermilk blue cheese, olive oil, Brussels sprouts, and peanuts. This was way bigger than we expected! It comes with 8 slices, and they are perfectly crispy with generous toppings. For the large entree, we got the pulled pork (12.50) which came on a bun with Apple-fennel slaw and a side of fries. With the fries, you can use regular ketchup or spicy ketchup, of which I would recommend the latter.We finished about half of our entrees, and had to have the rest boxed up, since we still wanted dessert. We got the strawberry creme fraiche tart to share (5) which was small, but the perfect size and taste to finish our meal.Overall, I would highly recommend this restuarant. The food comes out super quickly, almost as fast as fast food! We wee surprised very time a dish was brought out, and they were always fresh, hot, and plated beautifully. Keep in mind that they have seasonal menus, and this was the winter menu. The spring menu will be out in the next week or so, and I will definitely be back to try it!"
"I went for brunch. While light on the booze (though it's brunch after all, not a Saturday night), the food was delicious and the service was excellent. Lots of young families seem to frequent the place."
"Range is in a great neighborhood-y area of Lincoln Park, not too far from DePaul, in an area that I would think would be great for a restaurant. I've been twice now, once for brunch and once for dinner, and the brunch visit was definitely the star.The decor, first of all, is very nicely done and fits with the restaurant's organic, grass-fed type vibe. The booths are comfy-cozy, and the chairs for the tables look like they would be comfortable, but I haven't been seated at a regular table before. I love the light colors and the low light - very sophisticated and feminine.The service and food has been great both times I've been. For brunch, I absolutely adored the chilaquiles (perfect amount of heat and crunch) but I was less enthralled with the tamales appetizer for dinner. It just seemed like such a small portion for $9 and there was barely any flavor. I did love the tortilla soup, though. I would suggest sitting in the bar area for your first visit; try some of their imaginative (albeit pricey) cocktails and try a few small plates. I think I'll be back just because I love the decor and ambiance so much, but I'll probably try a few other items on the dinner menu next time."
The buffalo cauliflower appetizer was really yummy!!! I was super sad there were only a few so beware the portion was small but the taste big...I rated the main meal a 3 star but the cauliflower a 4! ...I ordered the lemongrass chicken...the chicken was fine but I did not detect any lemongrass flavor at all...it needed a lemongrass glaze or such...the atmosphere was quiet which was nice but the only thing I would go back for would be the cauliflower...my niece had a chicken sandwich and really enjoyed...those that ordered the flat iron steak gave it a 3 star...
"Range, how I love thee and thee farm to table fare.R: efreshingly creative seasonal cocktail menu that packs a punch!  My drink had lavender and other complex flavors in it, and I really enjoyed.A: bsolutely try the watermelon flatbread if it's still on the menu!  I was pleasantly surprised.  The sweetness of the fruit worked well with the bitterness of the arugula and salty, savory flavors from the cubed cheese.  This was a big W-I-N!N: ourished my belly with protein via the hanger steak, which came with fries.  Fries were very lemony, which was not expected... though that didn't stop me from inhaling them!G: reat, prompt service with a smile. E: gads, Sweet Mandy B's is up the block!  You have been informed.Highly reco!"
"One of my new all time faves! The presentation of the food, service and did I mention food is great! I recommend the roasted veggie bruschetta ! Sooo good! Def coming back to try out brunch!"
"While entertaining friends from New York City, we decided to have dinner here Sunday night. We had heard so many good things about Range, so we felt like trying something new and local. For a Sunday night, we had no issues finding a table, which there were plenty, and the ambiance was certainly quiet, cozy, and comfortable. The drinks were average, but slightly pricey. While the buffalo-butter cauliflower was a tasty treat, there was nothing special about that or anything else on the menu. The rest of the meal was mediocre at best--looks better on paper than it is in taste.The service was something left to be desired. When ordering, our friend ordered the Range burger only to be told 20 minutes later that they no longer have the burgers available for the evening. Furthermore, they held up all of the other orders while the new dish was prepared, so all of our flatbreads and other dishes came out nearly cold.  If Range wishes to establish itself as an upscale, sustainable spot for the neighborhood, then they better hire wait staff that know what is available on the menu. It is not a huge deal, but, based on the reviews, I expected better.I want to like this place, but there is nothing truly unique or original to get me to come back."
"I met a friend at Range for brunch on a Friday before we went to an afternoon movie and it was the perfect way to start the day!    The restaurant is located in the heart of Lincoln Park/DePaul neighborhood.    This farm-to-market restaurant has a great ambiance and good service.   Now, I have to admit the restaurant wasn't busy by any stretch of the imagination on this Friday mid-morning but you can just tell when the atmosphere and attention to detail will serve you well.   For brunch, I had the 'pork & salsa benedict' - two perfectly poached eggs on pulled pork atop a slice of potato served with an arugula salsa verde salad with pear pomegranate vinaigrette dressing - yummy yummy!!   For a restaurant to excel as a farm-to-table concept it requires an extensive network of local, organic farmers to provide the chef with great ingredients for his creative dishes.  I can't wait to return to see what new items the chef has whipped up next time!"
"We came here for brunch on a Sunday morning during our move weekend and the food is exceptional, the service excellent (granted we were there at 10:30am on a Sunday). Great coffee, too. What more could you ask?"
"Walking into this place was cool. It definitely follows the range ""theme"". Chicken coop boxes, grass ceiling and sign and cow tag chandeliers. The romantic flowy, sheer white curtains threw me off a little. Took a casual, laidback atmosphere and fancified it a little unnecessarily, in my opinion. But...how was the food?Eh, just ok. I know they talk about the fact that the meat is locally sourced, but honestly...I don't care. I just want it to taste better than the last place I ate at. And I want to want to come back. I'm not sure if I'm convinced this place is worth coming back to.The cocktails were inventive, but all tasted watered down for some reason. I had a moscow mule and a madame mim (didn't taste any elderflower, just vodka and lavender). Should've stuck w/ beer, which they have on draft.App: Buffalo cauliflower. Highly recommend by the server. Weak. The cauliflower was clearly raw, breaded and thrown in the deep fryer, then tossed in buffalo sauce. Boring and not fully cooked. Big disappointment. Who doesn't want veggies dipped in buffalo sauce?Dinner was a burger, which was delicious with maple flavored bacon on top to give it an unexpected sweet punch. Yum! But I thought a little overpriced. Fries were good, but standard. What you SHOULD NOT pass up is the ketchup. Pass on the aoili and opt for the 78 Red--an all natural, kick ass ketchup. So good. Made my night! (Also just found out it's available at Mariano's which has made me very happy). When our bill arrived and it was $168 for 4 people (one not drinking) I was wondering what it was that I ate/drank that cost so much. That's why I second guess this place...Highlight: the service. Big guy with suspenders? You're a gem, it was a pleasure being your customer!And the ketchup, of course. :)"
"Range was the first farm-to-table restaurant I've experienced and it definitely set a precedent! We started with the buffalo-butter cauliflower with buttermilk blue cheese sauce which was unique in taste. The right amount of hot paired with the cooling blue cheese. I got the grilled chicken sandwich with red cabbage slaw and ancho-cinnamon sauce and it was divine. My boyfriend got the Range Burger with 4 year aged cheddar. We will definitely be going back to Range not only for the flavorful food but the great atmosphere, the local beer and wine selection, and the great service (Thanks Christina!)."
"Well range is a nice restaurant, with welcoming and modern decoration idealy placed next to the Lincolm park.The service has been nice but not that well organized as we waited a loooooong time to be able to roder and to get some food! It was a weekday and late time for lunch but still...The choices and products were great and we hadsome very good meals and dome a bit less interesting for the price but still acceptable"
"Came here for brunch and was shocked at how empty it was for how amazing this place is!   Their menu changes seasonally, so I look forward to trying out all the new creations, but at the same time sad for what might be coming off the menu!The potatoes and ketchup are to die for, and that's only the beginning.  Local and organic stretches out to even the coffee and the ketchup - a very cool concept that I support.Be back for dinner shortly!"
"Looking for a quick well-made cocktail before meeting up with a friend, I scouted out the Range near Depaul Uni. The bartender was a great help during the slow late afternoon traffic. He recommended the ""in bloom"" and ""buffalo hunter,"" of which I had both. The bloom was great to start with because the flavors were floral and silky. Then the buffalo kicked it up a notch, reminding me of a Sidecar. On the side, I ordered some Bacon Fat Fries because, why not? They were as to be expected and paired with aioli that I mixed with the accompanied local ketchup (yum!). Such a treat to enjoy during a late-afternoon on a Wednesday."
The best thing on the menu is by far the cheese curds. I believe it was made of goat cheese. The ambiance was great and the food was delicious and fairly healthy. I had the lemon grass chicken and it was delicious. My boyfriend had the burger and enjoyed it thoroughly. It's quieter which is nice for date night but not too fancy. We split the ice cream cookie for dessert but it was much smaller than we anticipated. The wine selection was also good. The Path pinot was perfect. Mom absolutely planning on going back again soon.
"Every time I come here I find something new I love. This place is a short walk from my apartment and by far my boyfriend and I's favorite place to go if we feel like a restaurant dinner.The atmosphere is great! Very cozy and inviting and the wait staff is very friendly.I will say the menu is a little hard to understand - ingredients you might not commonly understand or unclear descriptions of the food, but the staff has always been happy to describe the dishes and everything has always been better than expected. I can't get enough of this place!! The menu also changes seasonly so there's always something new to try."
This is my second time back for the sweet potatoe waffle Benedict. When I was greeted I asked to sit in the sofa are I had sat a few weeks back and they said they don't serve up there. I mention that I sat there a few weeks ago and she rudely said the policy changed. No big deal so I sat at the bar. I placed my order and it seriously took 30 minutes to come out.  The server brought me and another girl a second comped oj Bc he knew we were waiting a long time. When I got my food the eggs were like cutting into a boiled egg.. It was pathetic. I had to sit and wait another 10 minutes for them to remake the eggs that came out as hard as the first. I was going to suck it up but the cheese was like plastic on my potatoes at this point and there were two crumbles of bacon on the Benedict. I excused myself and said I would be leaving. What a horrible experience. I refuse to pay for crap food and crap service. I feel bad Bc I loved that dish the first time I had it but this will be the last time I eat at this restaurant!
"Farm-to-table restaurant!Local and co-op meats/dairy/coffee make this place worthy of praise. The feel inside is a modern-country farmhouse feel, with cow tag light fixtures, and mason jar cocktails. It is a casual setting. Crispy Chicken and Thyme Biscuit: Excellent! There were plenty of incredible dishes on the menu, but the neighboring table's Crispy Chicken aroma lured us in the same direction. The Chicken was so tender and flavorful. The potatoes were moist inside, and crispy out, with the ability to taste all the marinated herbs/oil. The bacon beans were delicious. This was a hearty, yet light, meal! Excellent!Bow Truss Coffee- Excellent!Service- Excellent!"
"Found through yelp for great lunch near Lincoln park zoo. Was very pleased with the result as I was bringing a tough crowd. The decor is adorable very farm to table esque  - great lighting , flowers- we all ordered kale salads and were in heaven! Get the kale salad with chicken- so great."
"I have been to Range twice over the past year. I can't imagine how they stay open. The food is bad, I first had a very dry chicken sandwich several months ago, but chalked it up to a one time problem. Went there the other night and I had something called a bacon flatbread that looked like dog sick. It was sprinkled with overly salty goat cheese and peanuts that were seemingly just thrown on top. The brussel sprouts were ok, bitter, but some people like them like that. There were other disgusting looking things on it, but I limited myself to picking peanuts, bacon, and sprouts off the flatbread, and left most of it there.The service is ungracious and despite the physical charm of the restaurant the tables are uninviting.  I had a glass of wine and the flatbread and walked out of there for $27.including tax and tip.Horrible experience. I will never return."
"Drawn in by the promise of sustainable meats, my boyfriend and I enjoyed a brunch here a few days ago.The Chilaquiles were good, and the Duck Hash was also good. Didn't get a chance to try and cocktails or beer, but those also looked enticing.Service was friendly, too. Ambience was nice, and there were interesting farm-themed paintings all about.Overall, a solid addition to my list of sustainable-meat restaurants :-)"
"This place was excellent. From the ambiance, to the food, to the reasonable prices- you have to check it out!The drink menu was great, and I had a really good glass of local red wine. Appropriately priced. It took me a long time to pick out what I wanted to eat because there were just so many enticing options. I decided on the butternut squash soup (delicious!) and the frisee salad. The dressing on the salad was fantastic and homemade (a greek yogurt-based dressing). The salad was fresh and yummy. Not the best salad I have ever had, but really good nonetheless.I didn't get any dessert, but I probably will the next time I check it out. Great place in a great neighborhood, can't ask for more! Check it out."
"This place was awesome! They use local and co-op products and the interior design is that of a range. grass ceilings, cow-tag chandeliers, paintings of farms. Its a really neat and different place to come.BONUS: they label things gluten free and vegetarian. I ordered the Chilaquiles (which is gf) and it was incredible! Such a different style concept of brunch than normal. My boyfriend ordered the Pancetta Pesto omelet and loved it. The pesto was to die for. The only downside is there are no drink specials so unless you want to spend $10 on a drink (which I hear are good!) then dont come here expecting to get that nice Sunday buzz. TL;DR: GLUTEN FREE ITEMS LABELED, no drink specials, amazing atmosphere with amazing food. Great for out-of-towners too."
"How this place isn't jam packed every night of the week is a mystery to me. I have been to Range 4 times now and do not have one negative thing to say.Everything on the menu is prepared perfectly. Nothing is overcooked, or anything less than fresh and perfect. There is a range (pun intended) of tasty options, all locally sourced and so good.The buffalo cauliflower is my girlfriend's favorite food. Not just at Range, but overall all time favorite thing she's eaten.The prices are on par with other Lincoln Park restaurants, but the quality is far superior. This place is a welcome relief from the usual greasy pub food that plauges this neighborhood.The service is outstanding. Wait staff is extremely attentive without being obnoxious. Palate cleansers are brought out between courses and water glasses are kept full.The decor is understated and beautiful. The restaurant is a very nice place to spend an evening, there is not one thing I would change. I hope to see this palce stick around for a long time."
"My husband and I were looking forward to trying Range for a few weeks after a rave review by friends of ours, and after reading all of the positive reviews on Yelp we thought we were in for a treat. Unfortunately, we just did not have the same experience. I am still trying to figure out if it was just a fluke and we should give it another try in the future, or if we shouldn't bother. Cons: -Hostess would not seat us when 2 of us showed up early for our reservation for a party of 4, despite the restaurant being less than half full at the time. Oh, and I am 6.5 months pregnant and clearly uncomfortable standing around. It would have been nice if she could have just seated us to wait the 10 minutes until the rest of our party arrived. We even offered to order appetizers if that would help our case, but alas.......-Two of us ordered burgers. One person asked for medium and I asked for mine to be well done. Both arrived absolutely burnt and drier than dry, and that included the bun. The fries were luke warm and hard as if they had been sitting out for hours. Very, very disappointing. In all fairness, we did ask our waiter for fresh fries and he brought us some and they were decent. But nothing special.-Very limited salad dressing selection. I know they are not a salad restaurant by any means, but they offer a selection of 4 salads that are also optional side salads. All looked delicious, except that your salad dressing choices are limited to pear/apple vinaigrette or a fruit yogurt dressing. Literally no other options.-The man who came around refilling our waters was very sloppy and spilled water not only all over the table but on some of us and on our food. Multiple times. Finally we said we were happy to poor our own water, as they give you a carafe for your table.-Refills on soda, tea, etc are NOT freePositives:-Our waiter was attentive and nice, not overly friendly or anything but he did a good job. Apologized for the fries and promptly brought us new ones. -The atmosphere of the restaurant is appealing, very clean and fresh - nice without being too dressy or too causal. With all the rave reviews out there, I just had to be honest about our experience. Overall disappointing and I am not sure we will be back to give it another try."
"My absolute FAVORITE restaurant in Chicago--this place is a hidden gem!! Always amazing service, almost never a wait, and the food is soooo good. It's fresh, delicious, and perfectly portioned. Their menu changes with the season so each time I go there is something new and delicious to try.You MUST get the fries with the aoili. And then mix the spicy ketchup into the aioli--so good!Also the buffalo cauliflower is INSANE!! They're like little mini healthy (sort of) chicken wings!Any pancake on the menu is a must-have!I could go on and on, but I'll just leave it at: GO HERE!!!"
Sweet Potato Waffle Benedict - YUM! Our waiter was so fantastic as well!
"This place is wonderful! My mom was in town for the weekend and we wanted to take her to a ""farm-to-table"" restaurant (but being new to Chicago ourselves, weren't sure where to go!). A quick search popped up Range and we decided to check it out. We didn't have a reservation, but were seated right away.From the decor to the food to the service, all were top notch. My mother ordered the Pozole Soup and the Range Burger (both she loved), my husband and I split the Squash Croquetas (DELISH) because they were out of the Butternut Squash Soup, and I ordered the Butter Seared Chicken and he got the Berkshire Pork Chop. Everything was excellent! For dessert we got the flight of all three desserts and our favorites (BY FAR) were the Pumpkin Cheesecake and Apple Pie Egg Roll. The only thing the three of us agreed we didn't like was the third dessert: Pumpkin Cream Puff (lacking flavor and quite a disappointment compared to the other two). Overall, wonderful meal and environment. Will definitely return!"
"Very cute restaurant, great service, creative menu and great food. Went for brunch and I was tempted to order everything on the menu because everything sounded so good. I like that they divide the brunch menu into sweet and savory. The sweet potato waffle benedict was so delicious; I would highly recommend for brunch."
"Went here for a date, absolutely loved the modernized country farmhouse feel. Cow tag Light fixtures, mason jar cocktails..We had the Watermelon and Feta Cheese Flatbread with Arugula, Black pepper, and  Balsamic vinaigrette. Summery and light!"
"Food was excellent, service was friendly and quick but didn't feel rushed. Ambiance and decor is nice and you don't feel packed in like most restaurants. Great brunch spot as well."
"Large property in an excellent location. The decor is warm and inviting. If only the food and service matched the effort put into the design and ambiance. Came for brunch on Saturday. Should have been concerned by the complete absence of other diners. Coffee was luke warm and over extracted. The service was slow both when taking our order and preparing the dishes.  The savory food was passable, certainly nothing special. The pancake dishes got a solid C+. Unless improvements are made I'll be surprised if this place makes it to its anniversary. Here are a few suggestions:1. Develop a breakfast pastry menu (check out Lula's basket)2. Improve the quality of the coffee service. When business is slow consider serving French Press coffee in order to provide fresh made to order beverages. 3. Focus on quality and not quantity of food servedWould be excited to come back if the food improved."
"Another amazing meal! This place is spectacular. This is the best fried chicken I have every had and the cocktail selection is magnificent; especially the craft cocktails and whiskey selection.I must say that Range is my new favorite place and only wish they had a restaurant in NYC. The staff is amazing and incredibly accommodating. This is a great place for a date, but also for family. The environment is very intimate and comfortable."
"Wow. Buffalo Cauliflower.  So perfectly cooked. Rich, crispy, spicy. And they even brought us a ""palette cleanser"" of house-made sorbet before our Cubano and pork chop. We only eat responsibly sourced meat, and are new to Chicago. Range is only a block away, so we were eager to try this Farm to Table restaurant, and are very excited to return!!!"
"I went to The Range for dinner with a group from work.  What a find!  The space is very clean and has a modern farm theme that Eva Gabor would appreciate (you young'ns will have to look up that reference.)   The Range has a list of their major food vendors on the bottom of their menu, which I appreciate.  You know that they have developed a good relationship with local growers/butchers, and are buying quality ingredients.  Two diners started with carrot soup, which looked wonderful and which they said was quite good.  A great way to start a meal on a cold, cold night.For mains, one diner had the bacon flatbread and some had a veggie flatbread (I believe it was mushroom) that's no longer on the menu (because they serve only what's fresh.)  I had the roasted half chicken.  I loved the chicken -- very tender and  the skin was crispy and so flavorful.  Under the chicken were pickled veggies - carrots and greenbeans.  Amazing!  I love pickled vegetables, and these were delicious and complemented the chicken perfectly.  There were some roasted potatoes to top off the dish. The wine and beer lists offered a good variety.  The coffee after dinner was delicious.  Our service was excellent -- attentive but not overbearing.  I can't wait to go back and see what they have next."
"This place has unique offerings and provides a relaxed environment. The place strives for a contemporary menu, and it definitely succeeds at executing it."
"THIS IS A MUST-RETURN FOR ME!!!  The food and ambiance at Range reinvigorated my love for restaurant dining.  Conveniently located in the heart of Lincoln Park, range offers the modern menu item style of ""Smalls, Mediums, and Larges"" and thusly fits all hunger levels.  I enjoyed dinner so much that I cannot wait to try brunch, its most highly touted meal.  The food, ambiance, and service all require remarks, and the usual HIPSTER LEVEL WARNING is located AT THE BOTTOM.SPOILER ALERT: AWESOME COCKTAILS!  Just go and order one.To continue on the actual food, the butternut squash soup was a brilliant addition and hearty for winter.  Pureeing the soup is the one way to make a vegetable-based soup become extra delicious, and when you top it with homemade crème fraiche, both your taste buds and your memory of the South Park episode rejoice.  My friend enjoyed a major entrée in the Hanger Steak while I moved onward to one of the flatbreads.  Whatever culinary genius combined blue cheese with bacon won my heart, so that particular flatbread is somehow light but extremely savory and rich.  His steak was done to perfection, and he reported subtle yet discernibly unique flavoring.  In a Steak Town, that was outstanding.An added plus to this place is everything is made with local products (save some of the and the alcohols).  This results in unparalleled freshness and quality.  This place does not simply include local produce; rather, it moves onward and selects GOOD local spirits, for example.  The place fervently controls quality.The ambiance combines casual with modern dining.  The décor is a little 70's glamorous with a mix of 90's coffee shop, though without the hideous colors from each of those respective eras.  Two couch areas are perfect for congregating for the casual living room meal with friends without your having to clear and clean.  Bonus!The dinner service was complete and top-notch.  They served palate cleansers between courses, but pretentiousness never entered the atmosphere.  We had multiple servers and clearers, so the used pottery/china and cutlery did not linger at the table.  The staff's manners were exceptionally proper but unintimidating.HIPSTER LEVEL: Moderate, but staff-based.Again, the service is outstanding, but I just don't want to look at some casual waiter/waitress with silly oversized earlobes, a nose ring previously adorning a bovine, and a forearm tattoo.  Take it back to Bucktown because in Lincoln Park, even the students are no longer going ""Double-Pits-to-Chesty"" and no longer wearing faded 1980's t-shirts.  You're officially last year's item Hipsters; it's 2015!Overall, I remain ready to return even as soon as Saturday to experience brunch.  I'll have an update after I do have brunch with a report on that menu and the coffee quality."
"Came in for brunch last week and had a great experience! First, there was absolutely no wait which is refreshing to see in Lincoln Park. The space is decorated really nicely, we were seated by a high table near the bar. Our waitress came by and brought coffee which was a Bow Truss blend, it was so delicious. Our waitress (and everyone we interacted with at Range) was incredibly friendly. Range's brunch menu isn't very extensive, but all of the items are unique and interesting. I went with the maple-bacon sausage omelet and the boyfriend had the morning sandwich. As we started eating, there was no maple-bacon sausage to be found in my omelet. I opened it up to actually see if there was any inside and found two small pieces. I'm not sure if they have the omelet ingredients already mixed and I got unlucky, but it was kind of disappointing. The two pieces of maple-bacon sausage were phenomenal and balanced the white cheddar, spinach, and potatoes so well. The apple mustard and almonds on top added a sweet component, the flavors in this dish were very well thought-out and delicious. The boyfriend really enjoyed his breakfast sandwich, he just kept wishing there was more pulled pork. He had also added an egg, because it only came with one, and felt it wouldn't have been substantial enough to only have one egg. When we got the check, we were pretty surprised to see the coffee was $3.75 a cup. I understand it's a nicer coffee brand, but I feel this should be communicated before pouring because that's very pricey. Overall, Range has a great concept and their flavors are spot-on. However, the lack of bacon-maple sausage and pork on the sandwich are elements I think they can work on. I'll be back!"
"It wasn't a terrible experience, but I had higher expectations. The cauliflower appetizer was good, as was the beet shared plate. Unfortunately, the polenta dish a friend and I shared had a very enticing description, but ended up being bland. The wine list is very overpriced and way too Michigan-heavy, in my opinion. I support eating and drinking locally, but only if the product quality is high. a definite plus was that the staff was very nice and helpful, and did let us try both the Pinotage and Malbec before making a choice."
"Very cute date place - very chic, modern, white.  Service was good, the hostess was very friendly and accomodating on a busy Friday night.  Drinks are unusual, but tasty & the bartenders/mixologists spend a lot of time making them delicious.  Def will be back - happy to have Range in the LP hood."
"Enjoyed my first visit here last night. Liked the modern feel, it wasn't empty but wasn't packed either. One brief point of confusion was my wife thought it was golf-themed because of the green carpet-grass on the outer sign and with a name like Range...but it has nothing to do with golf.As others mentioned, the buffalo cauliflower was excellent! Consensus was that the crab cakes were very disappointing, but the roast beef sandwich was great. Fries were good and the special ketchup was interesting but not as good as I expected. Service was friendly, prices were reasonable, and I thought they had a good drinks menu (though I only went with a beer).Pretty good chance we'll be back, nice little neighborhood spot!"
One of my favourite places to eat in Chicago.    Many of the ingredients are locally sourced.   A rotating menu reflects the season including a great selection beers and cocktails.   Our server Linden was fantastic.   She gives great recommendations and is there when we need her but not hovering or rushing.   Then there are the desserts which I can never say no to.  Always something different and something I wouldn't have imagined eating.   I'll be back.
"My party of five came in on Saturday for dinner and drinks. I picked this restaurant without knowing much about it. We were heading to a nearby bar after dinner so I thought I would give it a shot based on reviews and the menu. We were promptly seated, even though we were early for our reservation and the entire party hadn't arrived.The service was great, our waitress was efficient and attentive. Our food was timely, as were our drinks. We didn't feel rushed, nor did we feel we were waiting too long for anything. The veggie burger was delicious! I'm planning on coming back again to try more items on the food menu. The cocktail list is creative and fun; an interesting mix of flavors offered. Apparently it is somewhat BYOB as well, they accept wine but charge a $15 corkage fee since they have a full bar. We decided to try the cocktails instead of bring a bottle of wine and were very happy with our decision. The cocktails are great. The ambiance was wonderful; comfortable, yet classy and modern. I was very happy with this pick for my group dinner. Also, when the check arrived, we noticed it was itemized and arranged by seat number, so we were able to easily figure out how much we each needed to contribute. That's pretty handy when getting one large check for a group. I would happily come again with a group or on a date. We were all very satisfied!"
"Another farm to table restaurant.  Nothing bad to point out here, but nothing really stood out either.  If you are limited to this area, probably one of the stronger picks.  If you are a party of two, they have a few tables by an open window which is very nice during the spring/summer.Burger--great piece of grass-fed beef.  No toppings, just enjoy the meat.Pulled pork-- a little sweet for me, but very tender.  The prosciutto was a nice salty touch.Cauliflower--normally not a fan, but this was quite good.  Nice buffalo taste and crunch to it.Cocktails are well-crafted and potent."
"I really loved the interior design.  The dining space is very inviting and original.  I was not as impressed by the food as I had hoped to be.  The pumpkin bits were very hard.  They had a big chunks of hard, raw pumpkin in the middle.  When my friend told the waiter he brought a new order that was a bit better.  The bacon fat fries are the best!  The soup was good.  My burger was good but not particularly special.  I would give this place another try."
"I've been to Range before and have taken multiple friends to brunch. We decided to try their New Year's Eve dinner, hoping for the same great food and service. It did not disappoint. Out of all the Lincoln Park restaurants, Range has the most unique and tasteful food. Our waiter on NYE knew exactly where the food came from and was honest as to what he liked/what he didn't like. The wine selection was equally fantastic.Not sure if they'll be serving any items on their NYE menu but I highly recommend the hanger steak--medium rare--which melted in your mouth and was accompanied by fluffy mashed potatoes. For Brunch, I recommend the duck egg sandwich which is both sweet and salty!"
"We were VERY GLAD to be able to walk down the street with our guests to this excellent restaurant. They have an extensive local wine list featuring many from the 45th parallel -- Leelanau Peninsula area. Since our guests had just driven the 6 hour drive from there this was pretty neat. I've been in the 'hood for a while now and remember the locations prior... La Canasta... and before that, Minimax --a mexican grocery with the restaurant in the back end. The food at Range is very different. Fresh tasty and reasonable prices."
"I shared the tamales and medallions. Both were good, not great.Decor is best part of this place.Wait staff was attentive. I'd return.Was able to find free st parking which always seems like a treat in Chicago!"
The two appetizers we had were lacking flavor as well was my meal of chicken and waffles. The fried chicken was almost completely bland besides the sticky honey on the crust. My boyfriends meal was phenomenal but only because since they ran out of hanger steak they served him beef tenderloin instead. The beef tenderloin was flavorful and well cooked. If you decide to try this place out I would recommend the Parmesan fries. I highly discourage the St. Bernard drink as it tasted like a sugar syrupy red sangria.Despite my boyfriend's meal we will not be returning to this restaurant. It wasn't bad but nothing to write home about.Service was mediocre considering we were the only people in the restaurant eating.
"Cute neighborhood spot with a slightly confusing decor.  My mom asked me why I took her to a golf restaurant.  Had a group celebrating a birthday, so we ordered several starters.  The buffalo cauliflower was exactly what it sounds like, it was rich and savory.  The cheese plate was straightforward with nice addition of the cranberry brie.  There was some disappointment with the green beans, being that there were only about 10 in the platter, not sure why they were so skimpy on that serving.The main dishes also did not blow me away.  I had the steak which was beautifully cooked, but served with cold and dry french fries that were served with an oddly sweet vanilla bean aioli.  I am willing to be adventurous with my palate, but vanilla bean aioli just did not contrast well with the dry and cold fries.  My boy friend had the chicken and waffles and raved about the chicken.  It was moist and flavorful, but the waffle was heavy and dry.  Overall really enjoyed the main pieces of the entrees, but felt like the sides were overlooked.  The drinks were spectacular and everyone enjoyed all drinks that were served."
"I was drawn to this place because of their use of local fare and seasonal menu. I try to support as many of those businesses as I can.Initially, my date and I were a little worried we were under dressed-looking in the windows the decor is lovely white with clean lines. Once inside the servers are very friendly and inviting and the restaurant gives off more of a calm old farm house feel, complete with fireplace!The servers were very friendly and attentive.The food was great! We started with the buffalo cauliflower and cheese plate (both fantastic!). I ordered the tortilla soup which had good flavor, but would benefit from some spice. I also had the spinach salad, very good. My date had the veggie burger and wasn't ""wowed"". He mentioned that it was a little mushy and suffered from what I like to call ""too much bun syndrome"". I like that they make it in house, so there is  potential to improve and add a little texture. I hope they get more people in to try out their food and relaxing and inviting ambiance! Will be back to try brunch!!!"
"Perfect spot in Lincoln park. It's got enough eclectic dishes to make everyone happy. We had the buffalo cauliflower, watermelon feta flatbread, veggie burger and unbelievable strawberry tart with blackberry ice cream. I was in heaven. The buffalo cauliflower was probably my favorite and I LOVE chicken wings so it took a lot to get me on board with this app. Very cute place. I will be going back even though I generally I feel guilty dining at the same restaurant twice in Chicago with all of the fabulous places to try."
"This is our secret favorite neighborhood place!  It has a fun atmosphere and is never too much of a wait, even on Friday night. It has great beer and whiskey selections, and everything we've tried has tasted amazing (especially friend chicken, burger, and cubano)!"
"I came her for a dinner date, and was pleasantly surprised. I like supporting new local businesses, so I figured why not try it?The ambiance is great, very cozy but modern. Staff and service was very prompt and polite. The food was tasty, and really well priced. I would definitely come again."
"Trying too hard, but in the wrong places! Let me start by saying the service was attentive and lovely - absolutely no problems there. But, the food was just meh. I ordered the salmon special - as did two others at my table - and we were literally sharing the one salt shaker at the table. It was cooked perfectly, but there was not much flavor. The salmon sat atop sweet potatoes and green beans and there was a ""sauce"" that sounded great (wine bacon leak?) but to me it tasted like melted whipped cream. Ordered a soft drink because I'm so classy... and it was super syrupy. Exchanged it for the house lemonade, which wasn't bad but SUPER sweet as well. Best thing at the table was the ""buffalo"" style cauliflower. Outstanding. Lastly, please fix the sewer smell coming from the east side of the restaurant. The server acknowledged this is known by management and it's thought to come from the space next door. Fortunately, she moved us further west where the smell only came in waves. I know, gross right?"
"Updated review for dinner service. In a word, excellent.  Range delivered with a well chosen, seasonal menu and drink selection.  The concept is essentially a modern take on a gastropub:  high quality tasty food and preparation, fun and inviting decor, great drink selection, and reasonable prices. Several different appetizers were well prepared and highlighted the ingredients and technique (prices $5 to $14). Main course choices were also excellent.  The hamburger is among the best in the city, hands down ($14); really showcases the superior beef used.  Pulled pork and turkey sandwiches are also winners (both under $13). As is the flank steak (around $20).  A well edited dessert list was also available (all $4), but we were too full to partake. Drink menu included a good wine and beer selection by the bottle, as well as a full range of drafts - each for around $6. In short, I don't write glowing reviews often, but this place deserves it. A great concept, well executed, in a wonderful neighborhood location. We will be back."
"I came here for dinner... A few things you should note... They had a soft opening in late fall. I know the menu is updated, it is seasonal. Management is always open to feedback, give it to them and they will listen. Right now you cannot make reservations online BUT you can call and make reservations... They do accept reservations. Space: Modern, clean lines and spacious. Service: Very friendly, attentive and aim to pleaseFood: My dining companion had skirt steak (which he devoured). He said it was cooked perfectly and the sides that accommodated the meal, were well complimented. I had the pulled pork sandwich and side of garlic/buttered green beans. Both delish and would highly recommend. The other part I really appreciate, which I do not see outside of traditional french restaurant, is the accommodate of sorbet (a pallet cleanser). Before dinner they bring sorbet out. Not only tasty, but really appreciate it. It really made the flavors of our meal jump out. Give the place a try, be patient and give feedback... No I don't work here, love the food and love the concept."
"Range is by far my favorite place to go to in Chicago. I love this joint because it's exactly what I want in a restaurant; the food is very well put together, being as fresh and as local as it can be, without being too rough on your wallet. One thing that's been continuously frustrating me about Chicago's food scene, is that it's OBVIOUSLY meant for people with lots of money. I make a decent wage working for a well respected bakery here in town, so I am invited to a lot of food events around Chicago. As such, I am very involved in the food scene, which is great! But, more often than not, I am left wondering how or why I just spent a quarter of my paycheck on food I could have prepared a lot better than the place I was eating at. I don't feel this way about Range one bit! They bring you farm fresh ingredients, and have pairing suggestions for craft brews or wine. I can order a very large portion of pork chop, accompanied by fresh locally grown, and organic vegetables and still have money left over for drinks and desserts. Great food shouldn't be reserved for people who make serious cash, it should be reserved for people who love to eat amazing food. Period."
"First the good...Decor: greatAmbiance: greatService: greatThe bad: FoodOk so I probably made the worst choice possible for the restaurant and would not give them such a bad review had I made a different choice but they totally deserve a bad review for what I ordered. My dish was embarrassing. I ordered the special for the night, the pumpkin squash ravioli. When it came there were 3 ravioli's on my plate. 3. It looked like an appetizer at best. The flavor was fine but it was also cold and the edges of the ravioli were a bit chewy and dry. I ate as slowly as I could but was still finished waaaaayyyyy before anyone at my table finished their food. Of the 12 people at my table I (and one other that ordered the same as I) had the most pathetic looking meals. Everyone had big plates of food and I left the restaurant hungry. I hate leaving a restaurants hungry. I went hungry because I was excited to try this place but left very disappointed.One last thing two people at my table ordered the pumpkin bites appetizer I tried half of one and it was uncooked on the inside and lacking in flavor. One person sent it back to the kitchen and they at least brought a new order cooked.Bummed."
"Range would be SO GOOD and welcome in the neighborhood IF they can do some tough-love menu editing.Atmosphere is great.  Spacious and relaxing with great lighting and decent noise level (being picky, I would have turned down the bad music a notch or two).Service was friendly and well-timed.  Our main server was delightful and all of the food deliverers and busboys were there when you needed them.Food was 3 out of 5 stars. Maybe because all of the other things were hitting just right, I think the food is actually where Range started to fall apart, and where I want it to improve the most.  The menu looks delicious and in most cases tasted it too, but a couple items just didn't work with the rest of the offering.We started with he Buffalo Wing Cauliflower and Pumpkin Bites, both were inventive and tasty!Then there was the ""Quesadilla Trio"".  Oh Lord, where to start? These were NOT quesadillas; they were empanadas.  And since whoever put them on the menu didn't know the difference, I think they also didn't know how to make an empanadas.  The dough was heavy and greasy and the fillings were absolutely tasteless.  The more I thought about this item, it just didn't belong on the otherwise American small plate menu AT ALL.  Our fault for ordering, but please Range, take this item off your menu.We also have the Bacon and Brussel Sprout Flatbread which was difficult to eat on account of the white cardboard bread it was served on.  All the little sprouts and bacon pieces kept falling off my plate... not exactly classy date behavior!  I wanted cheesy goodness and didn't get it from the quesadillas or pizza :(We also ordered a side of the Fingerling Potatoes, and while salty, I felt that these tasted very good and fresh.  I think if Range would stick to more of this straightforward, fresh, farm-to-table food, they would be doing much better!Overall, about $100 for two people with a bottle of wine, before tip.  Not sure if I would return... again, the place was so lovely, but some of the food left me wanting more taste.  Try it out for yourself, but do avoid the Mexican food items and Flatbreads at all cost."
"What a disappointment! Decor was on point and service was quick and smooth (thus 2 stars) but the food was severely lacking.  Specifically in SALT!  We started with the buffalo cauliflower.  So boring.  The cauliflower should be brined or blanched or cut down into smaller pieces so it can actually cook in the fryer.  The buffalo sauce was good but the white cup next to it?  Zero flavor, tasted like watered down sour cream. Or Creme fraiche that was wasn't allowed to ferment long enough. Not seasoned at all.Then I had the tomato soup (because what self respecting ""farm to table"" concept is serving asparagus in September?!?). Worst thing I ate for the night.  The grilled cheese croutons were soggy.  And the soup tasted like reconstituted condensed soup from a can-with too much water.  Salt and pepper (that I added myself) helped this out a bit but not much.  And the olive oil float?  Weird and unnecessary.The next thing we ate was the complimentary sorbet/palate cleanser.  This was the best thing we ate all night.  seriously.  Sweet/tart and enough to clear the palate from the first two lackluster courses.Our ""main"" was a Cuban sandwich that we split.  I knew this wouldn't be traditional based on the menu description but it was pretty far off.  Swiss cheese is a must for a Cuban. And pickles or peppers of some sort.  But that said, the sandwich presented was good on its own.  The pork was tender and the ham had a good flavor.  The accompanying fries were some of the worst I've had in a long time.  You can't have fries without SALT!  And that aioli was pitiful.  It was loose and flavorless and sad.  I wasn't offered the special ketchup but maybe that would have helped.After 3 mediocre courses, we opted out of dessert.  But my overall recommendation is to spend your money elsewhere."
"Cool new place in Lincoln Park, definitely worth a try!First off, I love Lincoln Park and this spot on Webster is a great location for a restaurant.  It isn't is a ""busy"" part of Lincoln Park so it is a great spot to park, grab a bite to eat and then walk over to the bars of Lincoln Park (if you are hitting up bars that night).The menu is VERY interesting.  I couldn't decipher any type of ""cuisine"" for this place but everything I had (along with my friend's food) was excellent!We started off with the tamale trio and they were all great!  Each had their own sauce/topping.  I really enjoyed that they didn't drench any of the tamales completely in the sauce/toppings.  They put just enough on to give it add't flavor while not taking away from the flavor of the actual tamales.For my meal I got the chicken sandwich and it was so tasteful, possibly one of the best chicken sandwiches I've had.  I add their house pickled peppers to the sandwich and WOW; what a great tasting pickled pepper medley (very giardiniera like)!!!  Fries are awesome and very tasty too!Very neat décor and a great setting in a great location!I'm definitely looking forward to going back!  Pretty close to a 5 star review but I want to go back and try out some different things first."
"From farm to table magic. The staff is always attentive, the interior is beautiful, and during standard brunch time when the wait at jam and honey is 45+ minutes, this gem of a restaurant 2.5 blocks away can usually seat you right away. The chilaquiles, pork salsa Benedict, any of the omelets and all of the pancakes are phenomenal for breakfast. Lunch and dinner and seasonal cocktails are also always spot on."
"Let's hope Range has more staying power than the last few places to reside here!Brunch was absolutely fantastic - they have Bow Truss coffee which is some of the best in the city. They also make their own very tasty bloody mix - something that is in my opinion crucial to a brunch spot's success :)Service was friendly, helpful and laidback - perfect for a lazy Sunday.Food was also very good - they had a good variety of sweet and savory. We had the chilaquiles (cilantro sour cream and pulled pork!) and the hangover sandwich. Both were great - we'll definitely be back soon!"
"I visited for brunch and it was awesome. I ordered the pecan crusted French toast (or something like that) and my friend got an eggy meal (I'm more of a sweet breakfast lady). Any who, each meal was special and individualized- far from just some scrambled eggs and bacon on a plate. Our waitress was attentive and patient, very kind. The bloodies are good too! Overall, a great brunch spot and I'm excited to go back to try dinner/lunch."
"Great food!  They had a lot of options for a variety of food preferences (gluten-free, vegetarian).  It made easy to satisfy our group.  I have been also impressed with the service both times that I have visited.  Very sweet and friendly staff - it's the kind of place in which you can just feel comfortable."
