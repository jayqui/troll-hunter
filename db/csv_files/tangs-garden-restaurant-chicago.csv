Tang’s Garden Restaurant
"Came here for dinner with a party of nearly 30 people because we had a bunch of relatives visiting from out of state. The staff was polite, attentive, and very accommodating, even when some of my family was taking a while trying to decide whether or not they wanted to move to larger tables. I can't speak for the dim sum here, but I did really enjoy their dinner items. We got over 10 dishes, and all of them were good. My family ate out for dinner that entire week with our relatives and this place was definitely the winner. Also, while you wait for your food they have salted peanuts for you to munch on. So good!"
"When in Chinatown, the prime time dim sum is around 11am.  supposedly because this is the proper time for dim sum action.   There's no dimsum carts which mean that you get the food fresh from the kitchen (but...make sure its after 11am).  The one thing different about Tang's is space.  You will never feel cramped in this restaurant which is important.  When you get up, you won't have to trip over another chair directly behind you.  That is a major plus.  The family style dinners are pretty good, they have fresh seafood that is not usually seen in Chicago like shrimp.  I've not tried the shrimp yet- but it is very reminiscent of what you'd find in Hong Kong where you get to select your own seafood and decide how you'd want to cook it.  I think the only way that you should have that shrimp is with lightly steamed or boiled and served with a delicious spicy/soy/garlic sauce blend.I must say that their house made hot chili oil really has good flavor and packs in the heat - a perfect accompaniment to any seafood item and just about anything they serve -esp dim sum items!Tang's is my new go-to spot for dim sum and also family style dinners.  Service is much better than the other restaurants in Chinatown.  The wait staff is very responsive and attentive - just let them know.  BYOB! No service fee."
"I will probably  never come back or recommend.  My sister in law told me she liked this place but I can't see why. I came with my husband and it's disappointing. Btw the two of us, we ordered simple. 1. Country style congee - the fish fillet was bad, I mean it's spoiled and the shrimp tasted frozen burned.2. Beef crepe - the meat was good, but the dough is not smooth and it was cheap on soy sauce3. Siu mai- lots of meat but no taste, just salty. 4. Honey glazed short rib - worst dish ever! This is not honey glazed, this thing is made of honey... it was meat candy. Couldn't even taste the meat, just sweet sweet honey... horrible. But the color was nice, they even made it look like honey.5. Pan fried veggie and meat bun - not enough  meat filling. 6. Fried dough- old refried, hard and old oil. Sad... just plain sad..."
"Services are so slow and there's a mandatory tip of 15% of the total after tax, which I don't believe it's legal. Waited 15min but nobody walked by to pick up the credit card. When I went to the cashier myself, I heard bullshit like this and was super pissed. I told the staff that this is ridiculous but she kept silence. I was like, for that type of service, you asked me to pay 15%? Never even heard of that before. I will never go there anymore. You pay for their lack of service. Nobody DEMAND that type of tip for a two person dinner with poor service."
"The jury is still out on this one because it's only been opened for what 6 weeks. So far customer service is slow but friendly. I know weird thing to say but it's true. At first we walk in it's bustling with people and tables. The hostess told us to wait for a table but didn't direct us clearly on where to sit. But we eventually say down at the clean and empty table in front of us. There wasn't enough high chairs to go around we ended up using a high booster seat for Jubilee and it worked but it doesn't look very safe.For a place that just opened up the first booster seat I picked up was already broken, i thought that was kinda sad. Anyhow, we move onto ordering and then waiting 30 minutes for each dish to get to our table. We only ordered like what 5 dishes or less. Interesting I accidentally ordered the "" beef stew crepe,"" which came out as tripe over the white noodle crepes and I didn't know beef stew to them was tripe. Ah it was my mistake for even ordering it so we tried it. It was okay.Their soup dumpling which I wanted to try to badly were a disappointing. Where is the soup in the dumplings? I didn't any or very much of it. My husband said his didn't have any soup, what a total let down. Get your act together Tang garden! I really want to like this Restaurant more."
Went late night Sunday for dinnerFood 3.5: asked for no msg ordered for 14 peopleService: 5Cleanliness:4
"I came back here for dim sum to try it out since I was here for dinner. Dinner was nice when we went. Dim sum seem to be a different story. The service was very slow - we had to ask to get our teapot refilled 3x through 3 different people. We asked for water and utensils couple times before they can get it to us. It was rather frustrating but it was a good thing most of us were busy talking to each other that time passed without getting too annoyed. The quality of the dim sum is decent. They have some options that other Chinese restaurants don't offer while they also have options that they make completely different than other Chinese restaurants. The taste is decent, though. They gave us coupons to use on the first week, but they didn't tell us that we couldn't use this coupons on weekends. There are no fine prints listed on the coupons and no one advised us when we were given them. Sneaky sneaky! They also have an expiration date so we ended up not using any of the coupons that were given. They updated their parking structure now. You can park in the lot next to the restaurant. Before you could drive in and it would open a big lot for customers to use. Doesn't seem like they have any rights for that lot anymore so just follow the colorful banners next to the restaurant to park your car.This is still a decent restaurant, but service needs to improve if they want to expand and grow!"
"An ok place for dim sum and with reasonable prices.  I'd go with 3-3.5 stars here.  Most of the assorted dishes we had were $3.39 to $3.89 and they were the usual and common dim sum suspects, including a bowl of congee.   They also have an extensive dinner menu.  They have a nice open, airy, and sunny dining room.  There is limited free and tight parking adjacent to the restaurant and it's an icy mess at the moment.  Possibly it will be paved later, as everything looks recently constructed."
"We ordered the sweet & sour pork with pineapple, and the kung pao chicken... Delicious! They give you a choice of what hot tea you'd like with your water... Green, Jasmine, and like 5 others.. Our waiter was Eric and he was very personable, we had a long 30+ minute conversation with him, very good and attentive service! What a nice restaurant!  will definitely go back"
"Dim sum today Sunday noon, not quite busy at 1pm. All delicious and fresh, and made from scratch  by taste, which met our high expectation compared to other China town area restaurants.  Steamed soup buns never arrived, sold out when we asked for after long waiting.  Wish they notified us sooner.  We also hope the exterior deco could be improved for the gem, including the front landscaping."
Our group of 10 friends went for lunch this Sunday. They have a few nice large tables for big groups. That's a plus. Some of the group have been here already. They wanted to see if service improved or the food. Still nothing to write home about. The food was a mix of bland or semi tasty. The food came out slow and not consistent. It was one plate or two then 10 mins later another couple plates. Not sure if I would go again for lunch. Although some say they are better for dinner. The parking is horrific. So if you want easy parking and flavorful dim sum for lunch go into Chinatown.
"customer service was terrible. They gave my family and I a big bowl of congee but no bowls or spoons. I also ordered the Shrimp rolls, but no sweet and sour sauce. I asked for water 3 times and I just said could not wait any longer so I went to the counter myself to get it and when they told me they'll bring it over I said no I'm going to wait here till I get it because the first time when I had asked for the sweet and sour sauce, it never came to my table. The restaurant was not busy at all. And when I tried getting the waitress attention (I know she saw me) she just walked away and pretended to not see me.  Eh I rather stick with chinatown. The prices were a bit pricey compared to the chinatown ones and the quantity and quality that they give you is not all that great either"
"This place started at 2 stars and quickly fell to 1.Parking is bad and inconvenient. We were a party of five and the person seating us asked us to sit at a 4 seat table. When we refused, she asked us to sit at a big, uncleaned table so that can wait for the table next to us to be cleared. When we were finally moved to the smaller 5 person table, we had to set up our own table. The dishes were dirty, and there were napkins scattered throughout the floor of the restaurant. When we were ready to order, many servers walked by, saw our order, and didn't take it. The situation was the same for tea refills. It was not that busy. There were many empty tables and servers walking around doing nothing.As the food came, I became progressively more frustrated.  The food was mediocre. I watched people that sat down after us get served first because people ignored our order for so long. The waitress placed down food without telling us what it is.Food:Fish fillet congee feeds 4. Made with rice bits so texture is badSiu mai was oily and tasted exactly like the shrimp dumplings.Beef tripe consisted of 4  thick pieces.Chicken feet was too salty. The dish only had 2 chicken feet cut into 3 parts rather than the usual halves.Beef balls were served atop a puddle of oil like the rest of the dishes. It also tasted like butter and oil. There was absolutely no beef taste.The beef crepe was also served on a bed of oil and lacked soy sauce.The stuffed bean curd skin was ok. It tasted more like a siu mai than a siu mai did, but that doesn't say much.The beef chow fun was a little oily but defintely one of the  better dishes we've had today.The bathroom was acceptable. It gets 1 star for the decor and entertainment of watching water drip from the ceiling. Yay."
"Having a great meal at Tangs: Beef/Bitter Melon, Salt and Pepper Shrimp, Clams in Black Bean Sauce and Sizzling Chicken and Peppers w/Black Bran Sauce. Its all very good, very tasty"
"Located a little outside of Chinatown so you can avoid the rustle and bustle of Chinatown. They've got their own parking lot but space is limited.Been here a couple of times for dim sum and they are one of the best dim sum places that I've been to in Chicago. I especially recommend the beef crepe. Not everything on the menu is available yet, but they're a new restaurant so I anticipate the menu will continue to expand. Service is pretty standard compared to other Chinatown places. I also appreciate the more upscale decor compared to most Chinatown restaurants. Looking forward to what's to come."
New place. We have been back a few times. I'm the only hawkwy at the table but the real hk folks enjoy it.
"I'm giving Tang's a 3 star only because as in many Chinese restaurants, Dim Sum and dinner may have huge variation in terms of quality, texture and taste. In other words, the restaurant may do well with one and poorly on the other. For the most part the service was great, the waitresses smile a lot relative to other Chinese restaurants in the area.The dinner entrees are well prepared and if this review was strictly on that, I would have given them a 4.5 star. However, the dim sum was pretty bad. Most of the dim sum dishes were over cooked and unflavored. The beef tripe was so overcooked and soft I could have suck it through a straw."
"We tried Tang at 3:00pm on a Saturday. It was between dim sum and dinner time, so we were slightly concerned, would the best chef and service be ""out to lunch?""No worries, the service was gracious, considerate and    timely...they even had genuine smile, though I expected their feet had to hurt! We ordered the sweet&sour pork, the sauce was delicate with the unique perfume of lai chi fruit. No wonder that chef has the reputation of the king of sauces. We ordered noodles (Dan-Dan mein) and it was perfect. We ordered a shrimp that had depth of flavor that I did not expect. My hubby loved it, I had to get used to it. But by the end of the meal I must admit the flavors were very nice."
"Had lunch with my co workers there. The service was terrible. Besides be slow, they had a hard time understanding English. Food was just ok, nothing great. For the price, there's better places cheaper!"
"I didn't order many dishes but the ones I did we enjoyed except for the cha sui. (bbq pork)  The bbq pork tasted like it was from Richland Market which is across the street. Salty and hard. It was hard to eat.  We also had peopod leaves, done very nice and large quantity.  The sweet and sour pork was Ok. Traditional but with big bones which would be my complaint.  The decor is in old fashion red that if I was transported their I would think I'm in China in the 80s.   They speak Taishan mainly.  In my opinion, not very exciting and very traditional.  On the positive.  FREE PARKING."
"Odd location for a restaurant, over priced food and parking sucks. The closest food place is Lawrence Fisheries, wedged in between a couple of warehouses and the back road that takes you to the main street-one way going south (potholes and scrap yard). The food is OK, lacks variety like the other places in Chinatown. They're charging premium prices for China Cafe food. They have 3 parking areas, if you have the good fortune, you will get a spot by the front door or you can park in the lot next to the restaurant (one way in and out) very tight parking and better have a small vehicle. Then there's lot behind the restaurant, you can park on both sides and leave enough space for one car to get by. Everybody is checking it out, because it's a new spot. Once everyone has tried it out, I don't see this place with a lot of regular customers. Too over priced"
Great food and very friendly service! Will definitely be back! I just hope not too many people find out about it and it is crowded all the time.
"I have been there twice for dinner. Both time we ordered the Peking duck, they slice the dick in front of you and wrap them up. it's Just So Good!!! I would say best in chinatown. Service is top class. We don't have to ask for tea or ice water refill and they were refilled automatically by the servers. They also provide quality house soup and the sweet bean curd soup desert. We have a big table and everyone commented So GOOD! The server cleaned the table after soup and before serving dinner. Is hard to get these kind of service as most chinatown restaurant don't clear or change plates! They just throw everything to you and clean all after u pay! I was impressed, very impressed. Their food is great, not salty or oily. Had my best salt and pepper squid in town. Not chewy but soft and fresh! The lamb dish also a must try, super tender and juicy. The decor is another plus point. Make it look upscale but competitive price. I will be back for sure! With more friends...."
