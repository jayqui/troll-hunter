Home Bistro
"Made a reservation for a party of 6 on a Friday night and.....-We sat right down at our reserved time-Our waitress was awesome, especially with bringing us booze from our BYOB stash-Regarding the above, there was no corkage fee and we brought a lot to drink-The Shishito Peppers  were an excellent appetizer with a bit of a kick-They had a special crab sandwich on the menu the night we were there, it was delicious, though it got soggy by the time I finished the first half-The Truffle fries!!! Woah! Best thing I had the whole night. I am a sucker for fries though-I don't personally like bread pudding, but all other 5 people at the table raved about how good it was-The total bill for 5 apps, 6 entrees and 2 desserts was $220 which is VERY affordableWill definitely be back here again."
"I'm a little surprised I really hadn't heard much about HB since it's a tiny spot in Boystown that features a menu that isn't exactly out of the ordinary.  That's when I sat down and read the menu, and found this in the appetizer section:""Beer-Battered Asparagus""Home Bistro does comfort food right, and the asparagus was no exception.  First, the damn things were huge--and they were mounted on one side of a large plate with a dipping sauce that was basically mayo and horseradish and a big egg that you broke to mix in with the other sauce.  This worked well.  The rainbow trout was my selection of an entrée and that also worked to perfection, although I would admit ""perfection"" included salted flesh, near-perfect potatoes and pickled red cabbage, which isn't something I look for typically.  My wife grabbed the mussels, mainly because she ALWAYS gets mussels if they are on the menu...the gobbling sounds of delight from across the table told me all I needed to know there, although the fries were not much better than McDonald's with an aioli that wasn't memorable.  (Of course, we downed all of the fries and nearly all of the aioli anyway...but, still.)With tax and tip, we got out of this for $62.  How was that possible, with all of the entrees prices in the $20-and-up category?  BYO, my friends.  If you are gonna give me high-end food and the chance to bring my own wine, you and I will become very close, very quickly, so I have to give HB credit for making date night for the two of us so very worth it.A La Card steered me here so we got $10 off of our meal...grab that deck if you haven't already!"
"The only reason this restaurant is getting two stars instead of one is because of the pleasant atmosphere. Otherwise, I came with a party of 6 and no one, I repeat, no one liked their meal. Food was bland and unappetizing.At this price point we were all supremely disappointed.No thanks!"
"Came to Home Bistro for Easter Brunch with some of my favorite Yelpers and two other friends. Seeing how this was my first day of drinking since Ash Wednesday I don't recall two much from this brunch after the 2nd of 5 bottles of champagne. What I do remember is:1) the excellent service we received from the moment we arrived2) how they kept our bottles of champagne on ice as we plowed through them3) how delicious the food was (I had the HB breakfast sandwich and it was damn good)4) how affordable the dining experience was (my credit card statement showed I spent less than $23 dollars)I will definitely be coming back to Home Bistro with my bottles of booze to enjoy great food, service and friends!"
"This place is pretty small and not eye-catching from outside. It's pretty dim and quite inside, which is good for a date dinner I feel. There are not overwhelming choices on the menu. We ordered fresh off the cod corn salad and red leaf lettuce salad! They taste pretty awesome except for they are a little bit too salty. But over all experience is positive in this restaurant:)"
"Bravo! Home Bistro has moved into my top 5 places for dinner in Chicago. On a whim we decided to make a reservation since we were heading to an event down the street. We were able to secure a same day booking, which was nice. The space is cozy and ideal for small groups (less than 4, but ideally 2). While you could bring a large group, the place itself only seats around 50, so be careful.  The menu is amazing. There were so many great options it was hard to choose what we wanted.In terms of our meal, we got he red leaf salad, fried oysters, Amsterdam muscles, and the pork shoulder steak special. The muscles came with a huge bowl of fries, which coincidentally went really well as an accompaniment to the pork shoulder steak. I had never seen pork shoulder (still with the bone) served like a steak, but I'd easily order it again. It was perfectly grilled with a creme fresh and strawberry compote on top. Very simple, yet highly flavorful.   It's BYOB, so plan accordingly. There is a 7-11 across the street if you wanted to pick up something. If you bring wine and need it chilled, they can bring a bucket out for you table side. There were only 3-4 front of house staff working, but it was perfect because HB is so small. They were all highly friendly and made a point to explain the entire menu, and check on us frequently. The food came out promptly after ordering. Again, great work, Home Bistro! We will be back for sure. We will for sure be back to try the items we didn't get to sample. To me, this is the sign of a great chef and menu planner. Just seeing all the great things on the menu will bring us back. They don't need to advertise or anything, just keep offering great food at a reasonable price."
"Yowsa, this was one of the most delicious and flavorful dinners we have had in a while.  The flavors in every course were all so complimentary and distinctive.  To boot, we enjoyed the $33 pp prix fixe dining option on this Wednesday evening.  What was particularly nice for this prix fixe was that you pick whatever 3 courses you want from the regular menu, and it looked to be roughly a $12 pp discount.  It's also BYOB, and I brought in some FFF Gumballhead, but almost every other table had either wine or champagne it appeared (good for them, but beer was perfect for us).   So, I ordered up:- Housemade corn dogs (not from the ballpark, but rather made of beef short rib)- Braised beef cheek fettuccine- Cranberry bread puddingWife ordered:- Smoked eggplant appetizer- Belgian endive salad- Rainbow trout, which came with a fried egg (this was best course of all the very good ones we had).The menu photo has a much better description of the courses.  The only minor knock was the fettuccine was slightly undercooked.  Otherwise, awesome meal and a charming venue.  This place is tiny (we counted 14 tables) and can get noisy when filled, but it would also be a great date night sort of place.  At regular prices, I would say it would be on the spendy side.  Server was Amy, and she was very friendly, attentive, and always had a nice smile.  She and the help were also very efficient.  The place has been around for 10 years, and it's high average 4.5 star Yelp rating for 700 reviews is well deserved.  FYI - I don't think there's any free parking in the area - it's standard metered $2/hour with the rest of the area looking to be permit parking.  Overall, great place to try at least once and highly recommended."
"Really incredible. cozy warm vibe with upbeat music so you won't fall asleep. Had the pork belly to start, was absolutely to die for. The waitress was friendly and laid back, pretty fun to engage with. Had a fried gnocchi dish and we also got the special fish stew."
"Home Bistro serves 5-star food at a reasonable price. Taste-wise, this restaurant is probably among the best in Chicago. What's more, every Wednesday, you can get a 3 course meal for just $33 (a $50+ value)! The interior design is very unique too. I would call it cozy but quirky. Unfortunately, the restaurant is a bit small.But the reason why Home Bistro doesn't get 5 stars is because of the service. I counted just one waiter, and if there were more waiters, it certainly feels like there's only one waiter. If service time were to improve with an additional waiter, then this would definitely be a solid restaurant."
"Definitely a 5 star experience! Hubby says this was his best meal ever in Chicago! It was for sure right up there with some of the best I've ever had. From the moment we walked in and were greeted by the lovely smiling hostess, I was feeling this place. We had made a reso and arrived before our other friends, but they went ahead and seated us which we appreciated. We had brought two bottles of bubbly and opened one right away....why hold off the celebration?? Our server, Dionne, casually floated by, took the one bottle to keep cold and brought us an ice bucket for the open bottle. More to come about this amazing ""floating Dionne"" to come....Our friends arrived, with another 2 bottles of wine. We don't play. Anyway, Dionne came right over and took care of them as well...opened their one bottle and poured a couple of glasses for them. She then floated off to give us time to chit chat and settle in. In a few minutes, she returned, sat down next to me on the bench and proceeded to share the specials. We loved that Dionne felt comfortable enough to cozy up to us in this way. We are a pretty open and fun group, so it felt completely natural to have her on our level and just being real and down to earth in the moment.So for starters we had the fried oysters, patatas bravas and the artichoke appetizer. Where do I begin??? The detailed preparation, mix of fresh flavors and presentation were beyond impressive! I can't even begin to explain the explosion of savory delight that occurred upon each and every bite of literally every dish. Unbelievable! I'm so serious!For entrees the two guys got the buttermilk fried smoke chicken sandwich, with slaw and pickles. Ridiculous.....ohhhhheeemmmmmgggeeeeee they were like, ""this is the best sandwich I've ever eaten!"" And, for certain it was. The sandwich came with truffle fries. Now, I'm obsessed with truffle fries and these were hands down THE BEST truffles fries that have touched this mouth. Hubs was like, these fries are kinda white looking, so Dionne told him to try one to make sure they were done. He tried one and was floored with delight. They were perfect. So, get this, as we were going hard on our food and having great conversation, Dionne ""floated"" by again, slid between our friends and swiped a fry off my husbands plate! Lol it happened so fast and we were all like, did that just happen?!? We totally lost our shit and were laughing hysterically as Dionne stood back and winked! She became my hero at that moment. I realize a server can't get away with that kinda stunt with most people, but that she could read our vibe and have fun with us, made the experience one of my favorites ever!I got the soft shell crab special....deliciousness. I'm an east coast girl originally so I could def appreciate this wonderful dish. My gf had the vegetarian dish with spatzel and cheese. It was also a delight. Dessert was next. Oh my oh my. We couldn't decide on one to share so we got all three. The panda cotta with lemon zest, pepper and salt. Sounds weird but was our fave. The bread pudding was incredible and the dark chocolate with walnuts and dried fruit was spectacular. We will def be back...and often!!"
"This is such a quaint little restaurant tucked away in Boystown. It's BYOB so make sure to bring a couple bottles to enjoy with your meal!I decided to come here for my boo's birthday dinner. Based on the reviews and the fact that it was BYOB, I thought it would totally be worth a try. Even though it was a Tuesday night and there weren't many people in the restaurant (4 tables including our party), it took a while for the food to come out. Other than that, the service was very attentive and I can tell that they take pride in the dishes they come out with.We ordered two of the specials that day, which was a pork tacos (definitely had a kick to it, so if you can't take spicy, beware!) and the pork loins with creamed corn. We also ordered the mussels, which were on the main menu. We both loved the pork tacos the best, mostly b/c of the spicy kick that it had along with the complementary flavors of the kimchi and Thai mango salsa. The mussels were pretty decent, not like the most amazing mussels I've had. By the time the pork loin dish came out, we were getting pretty full, so we actually only had a few bites of it and took the rest home.Since it was my boo's bday, of course we got some dessert. They brought it out with a little lighted candle so that he could make a wish. What'd you wish for, honey? Your wish already came true when you met me! (Barf)"
"Visiting Chicago from Los Angeles, and had a great meal here. I was still thinking about it the next day! I ordered a special, which was ricotta gnocchi with chicken, spinach, peppers, and blue cheese. It was amazing. I would definitely recommend this place and hope to go back."
"Step into Home Bistro (HB) and you'll be met by a friendly hostess and warm dining area. It's not big at all and expect to be pretty cozy to your dining party and those around you, as well. I love BYOB places and HB is one of them. Bonus points because they let us crack our bottles while waiting, even bringing out glasses. Once seated at our table, they provided buckets of ice to put our bottles in - a much appreciated gesture.Service is spotty. We would go long periods of time without seeing our server and it always seemed to be when we needed something. Food also took quite a long time to come out. It was a Friday night and very busy so I understand but just a heads up not to expect a quick dining experience here.When the food came out, all thoughts of an upcoming mediocre experience dissipated as my hunger pains were satiated by deliciousness. I had the Berkshire Pork Belly for $23. The pork belly sat atop a bed of german potato salad, house bacon, rhubarb butter, and marinated lacinato kale. The elements of the dish married well together and all melted in my mouth. It was a truly delicious dinner that I'd highly recommend.Food is amazing at HB and I would love to go back to try more. It's a cute restaurant but gets very crowded and noise levels are through the roof with hit or miss service. All in all, a great place for dinner with friends having conversations & catch-ups with your BYOBs but may not be right for a date night."
"I live super close and have gone for years. The food has waned over years and my dinner guest and I decided this was the last oppty HB had to wow us. I left happy. Grilled octopus (daily special) - meh, octopus was overcooked, carrots undercookedTapas-like potatoes - quite good after you stir it together (warning: it's VERY filling)Duck breast - meh, didn't finish itCHORIZO FLAUTAS Think 'a cross between a flauta and a somosa' with a heavenly garnish. While this dish still has growing to do, it was a surprisingly innovative dish with tremendous potential. Outstanding!!! I encourage the chef to take this just a little further...it will be his signature dish.PANNACOTTA was even better. Very interesting in a yummy way. I heard the server say cardamom, but it was more elusive than that, in my opinion. The flavor was too hard to narrow down other than 'spice'. One of the most innovative - yet simple - desserts I've had in a long time. Bravo.Note to restaurant (on the chance they read this): 5 year loyal customer, but visits are less frequent over time. Stopped to analyze it (over dinner with my guest) and decided it was because the menu is too slow to evolve. I can pretty much guess the menu before I walk in. Evolve, please. I want to experience new food. If the flautas and the pannacotta are an indication of what you can do, then don't hold back."
"So years after I should have tried HB, I finally get around to it now that I've moved back.  This place lived up to the hype in a city full of overhyped restaurants and bars.   Small little place and definitely a little loud, but that's all worth the amazing food.  We started with the handmade pretzels and the beer cheese.  Omg, the pretzels were so warm and soft, and the beer cheese was absolutely perfect.  The consistency was so soft and creamy it was almost like a mustard.We each had the specials tonight.  I had the gnocchi with pork belly, and a sort of relish sauce of garlic and other delightful ingredients that I can't recall because I was equally enjoying the fact that HB is BYOB. (no corkage fee).  My gf had the pork loin on a bed of polenta and spinach.  Also amazing.  Finally despite being stuffed we could not pass on the bread pudding.  It was good, although not the best I've ever had.  But between the starters, entrees, and great service this place is 5 stars easy.  Oh and the portion sizes were made for humans and not mice.  Definitely a plus.  Cozy, romantic, really a perfect date night.  Worth every penny."
"My first dinner in Chicago:I forgot to make a reservation, but thankfully I called at 6 and made a reservation at 6:30 PM. Uber there and made it around 6:40 PM. It was no wait, small, loud, nice atmosphere, sweet waiter place. We ordered the fried oyster for appetizers and then the roasted duck and pork belly for entrees. The fried oyster was alright, I know the special thing was supposedly the sauce, but not a big fan. Though the roasted duck and pork belly were fantastic. The roasted duck was crunchy on the skin and very flavorful. The pork belly just melts in your mouth, asparagus and risotto came with the pork belly and it was also very good. Thought I could tell that the taste of the pork belly and the duck was very similar, maybe same seasoning? But with the flavor of the meat itself is different, the dish tastes different enough.Definitely will come back if I'm back to Chicago, gotta try their mussel and truffle fries next time."
"I initially found this because it is BYOB, and was pleasantly surprised to find out just how amazing all the food is. We ordered an array of specials, including the gnocchi, Eggplant Caponata, HB Caesar and the braised pork shoulder. Everything we had was so wonderful, and the atmosphere is perfect. I absolutely agree with others who have gone on and on about the service. Perhaps the best casual service I've ever had, anywhere. Attentive, personable - they just made it look easy. Hospitality, they has it. We enjoyed dinner so much, and this little neighborhood is darling. My brother and his husband put an offer on a house down the street the day after our dinner here, so I'm sure I'll get to come back sometime soon!"
"Man, I wanted to like this place. It's BYOB as well so we brought some wine. Situated in Boystown, it's a very fun little neighborhood. Parked sort of near the ball park. Parking sucks in general in Chicago, hah.Anyway, the food. We shared the beer battered asparagus (really good) with malt vinegar aioli and soft boiled egg and we shared a salad of the day. For food, I got the salmon with melons and wheat berries. This was not pleasant at all. I thought I'd like the texture of the wheat berries but these flavors just did not mix well. It was just so odd...didn't like it.My friend ordered a goat burger which was HUGE. It had a 'Mexican' flair with it but even those flavors didn't mesh so well. It was just not pleasant.Overall, the experience was just okay, but for the price of the food, it really wasn't great. I'd go elsewhere."
"A friend of mine told me that if I only visit one restaurant in the ambiguously named Boystown/Northalsted/Lakeview vicinity, it needed to be HB (Home Bistro).  So off I went, on a cold and rainy Wednesday evening.It might've been dismal outside, but the interior of HB is warm, cozy, and very inviting.  Lots of earthtones and oranges, mirrors, and candles whisk you off to a romantic villa somewhere on the Mediterranean coast.  Once I was seated, HB felt like a perfect refuge.I lucked out by showing up on a Wednesday, since that's their prix fixe night -- $33 for 3 courses.  That's a killer deal for high-end cuisine in a high-rent district.I started dinner with some hot tea -- perfect for keeping those Midwestern chills at bay.  (HB is a BYOB, so no booze on the menu -- sorry alchies!)Course #1 was baby beet salad with honey ricotta, hazelnut streusel, and arugula.  I normally love beet-anything, but I didn't enjoy this salad at all.  The beets were totally undercooked (mostly raw in the middle), and all that raw earthiness clashed badly with the overly-sweet honey ricotta and streusel.Course #2 was much better: pan-roasted Atlantic salmon with couscous, cucumber ralta, and strawberries.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, and the cool raita and sweet strawberries contrasted well with the fish.The real highlight was Course #3 (dessert) -- bread pudding.  I get the impression that this is the specialty of the house, and for good reason.  It's moist and light and crazy flavorful, without overdoing it on the sweetness.  It's probably the best bread pudding I've ever had.Service was very gracious and friendly.  Even though I was dining solo that night, the hostess and server made me feel like part of the family.All in all, even though the food was inconsistent, there's still lots to like about HB."
"Make that reservation! HB (for ""Home Bistro"") was, well, a homey bistro with good food and a casual, charming vibe - not too many soft surfaces for noise absorption, but it never got distractingly loud.For appetizers, the 4 of us shared artichoke fritters, pretzel rolls with beer cheese, and escargot. The other two were good, but gee golly, that escargot! My heart may have fallen a little when it was set on the table in a large bowl rather than drenched in butter/garlic/parsley in the typical escargot dish, but this thing way surpassed my expectations. Huge and very tender escargot had been removed from their shells and sat in a near-stew of tomato and mandarin orange. Not the most camera-friendly dish, but it tasted spectacular. Damn, that orange! If you eat nothing else here, eat this.Two of my friends got lamb burgers and seemed to enjoy them enough. When I tasted the patty, it was gamey, lean, and not overdone with seasonings like most other lamb burgers. Don't order this if you don't deeply love eating lamb.My rainbow trout (sustainably farmed in nearby Wisconsin = extra points!) was awesome, and reminded me of the lovely trout mullerin at Katja (yelp.com/biz/cafe-katja-…). Two large, thin, perfectly cooked filets shared the plate with rainbow chard, oniony and starchy shoestring potatoes, and a sunnyside-up egg. The different components were fun to eat.I don't typically seek out ""American cuisine,"" but I really liked this spot. And by my sad, sad NYC standards, entrees topping out at $25 is pretty great. BYOB makes it at least 6 times as great. Servers were tremendously competent and friendly and brought out different glasses for our different booze. We took full advantage (to the tune of 6 large bottles of mostly crafty beers... no corkage fee!) and it felt perfect."
"I rarely give a one star rating, but based on my visit Home Bistro earned it.  This was a major let down, because I searched through Yelp for about an hour before finally selecting this place.  The only positive was we were seated immediately despite it being pretty packed.  I love bacon wrapped dates and order whenever I find them on a menu.  Big mistake.. The dates were incredibly sweet in the worst way, not to mention topped with brown sugar.  I also ordered the short rib corn dogs.  Mistake number two..  I'm confident any freezer brand corn dogs would hold its own against these in a blind taste test.  They weren't terrible, but not distinguishable difference a standard corndog.$25 into my meal and I was already experiencing buyer remorse, but I stayed the course in hopes of better entrees.  But wait.. Our server hadn't been to our table in quite some time, so our entrée orders weren't taken.  I found this to be odd because every other table I observed impeccable service and attentiveness.  No explanation, but true.  Rarely have I visited a restaurant where they allow water glasses to get empty, let alone sit empty for over 15 mins.While waiting for our server to take our entrée order the busser noticed we weren't eating our apps & offered to take them away.  He also filled our water.  When our server returned, I reminded her to take our entrée order.  We opted for the trout and the short rib tacos.  After another long wait and no water, we finally received our food.  The tacos came with a side of refried beans, which were cold.  The corn tortillas were straight from the package. Not warmed.  The trout was overcooked and tepid.  My guess is our plates sat in the back for a while better coming out.  We picked at both dishes, but left 90% on both plates.  When our server found time to ask, I let her know we were disappointed and explained the misfires with each dish.  She offered no response.  No offer to remake or order a different dish..No offer to remove items from the bill.. No offer to notify the owner, who was onsite.  My friend's company hosted an event in the past and recognized him as he stopped by several tables, not ours.  I requested the bill, paid in full (third mistake), left the food and went across the street to Wood.  In summary, HB has below average to mediocre over-priced food and inconsistent service.  In my top 3 worst dining experiences  of 2014.."
"Fried oysters are great and are a decent portion size when usually oysters aren't. Salmon is served cold and the pork belly is an amazing dish. Different dessert than I was expecting when we ordered it, they were pieces of chocolate with cherries. Friendly staff but not busy at all, but it was a Tuesday night when we went!"
Pork chop and bread pudding were bliss. Did the prefix on a Wednesday (3 courses for $33). Well worth it.Will definitely return many times in the future.
"The main takeaway: excruciatingly slow service. They have only one server + one water filler/greeter. The restaurant is not big, but the labor is clearly not enough. The appetizer came fairly quickly, but 40 minutes after we finish the appetizer, the entrees are not coming for a table of TWO....by that time, we have finished eating the Hershey's kisses I could find in my purse (reserved for my toddler's emergencies). It is getting ridiculous feeling the table so empty for so long.  Other tables around us are also helplessly waiting. They didn't even have bread to help you to get over these long waits, which I expect from this not too modestly priced restaurant. Finally, I got the server's attention and asked him to check the progress of our dish. He came back saying the chef needs another 5 minutes because the duck breast my husband ordered takes a LONG time to prepare. (I was thinking: gosh, just bring it, we can eat it medium rare.)When the duck breast finally came: it is medium rare. It is pan-seared and it is rare!!!! It is obvious that this dish takes 5 minutes to prepare. Okay, why the server was not honest with us: sorry, the chef is so overwhelmed that he or she has forgotten to prepare your dish in the last 50 minutes!! We are not dumb!The food is fine.  I ordered mussel with fries. The fries' texture is great but they lack salt so I asked for some, and the salt came in a little open dish, so I cannot sprinkle them at all without getting my fingers all in it. The appetizer portion is small: the baby octopus ($13) has three pieces of what taste like mother octopus to me. The overall experience was not good. Some sincere advice for this place: 1. Hire more people2. Prepare some bread so people do not starve while waiting for foodP.S. My husband added that the place is not romantic because it is quite loud with tables close to each other."
"Very impressed with the flavor of the food and the establishment itself. Great service, quick service; but the servings left me still feeling hungry. Would suggest a starter or a larger dish to order. I had the vegetable squash entree."
This place is a gem. The staff is extremely friendly. The ambiance is great and so is the food! Make a reservation on their website for easy booking!
"Intimate, cozy restaurant.Braised Duroc pork shank ($23) - 4.5 stars. Sweet potato puree, cider-braised kale, house bacon, pear butter. The meat was so tender, no knife required.  Delicious purees & mashes. The kale's sweet acidity went well with the meat.Lamb burger w/truffle fries ($20) - 4 stars. Lots of flavors in this burger. Good, but I'd rather order something else next time.The restaurant space was a bit small with the tables close together, but overall, I enjoyed the atmosphere & food. It was packed the night we went, but the noise level was fine for conversations. Would go here again :)"
"My relatives came to visit me for my birthday so I thought it was the perfect occasion to celebrate the reunion at a restaurant. I chose HB because I heard many good things about it. First of all, I was a little skeptical because I didn't want my family to be disappointed but we ended up having a great time.The atmosphere was perfect for us, as the background music was cheerful and not very loud so that we could easily hold a conversation. The waiters were very polite and described the menu with patience so we never regretted what we ordered. When the food came we were surprised by the huge portions but everything was so delicious that we left nothing in our plates. I personally loved the seafood stew which was way better than what I had eaten in other restaurants. I also liked that although we stayed a lot of time laughing and talking, no one kicked us out after we finished eating. HB turned out to be the perfect choice for me and my family."
"This place has amazing food! Everything that each person got at the table tasted perfect.  I would definitely come to eat here again.This place is cute and small, has it's own personality.  It can get a little loud and crowded as the space for the restaurant is a bit cramp.The only reason I gave this place a 4/5 stars is because of the lack of customer service. The server took forever to stop by with the menus and barely if ever, checked on us."
"If I go into a restaurant happy, and come out even happier, then that place deserves 5-stars.  I had originally made reservations for a Friday night at 6 p.m. online knowing fully well that there was no way I was going to make it in time with Friday traffic, but it was the only available slot.  So, I called HB, and David picked up to inform me that they were completely booked.  I told him about my situation, and he told me that he would call me back if someone cancelled.  I thought for sure I was not getting a table, but around 30 minutes later, someone miraculously cancelled, and David actually called me back to give us a 7 p.m. table.  So my friend and I made it there with amble time and a great parking spot.  The food was good and huge portions as usual.  David even came by to say hi to us.  Such a sweetheart.1 star for good food1 star for great service1 star for reasonable prices1 star for byob1 star for making my friend and I happy campers!"
"I went here last weekend for a friend's birthday. It's worth noting that I've been here several times prior to this visit and still keep coming back. It's a charming restaurant with a great staff and delicious food. Plus, the BYO option makes it really hard to beat. Great bang for your buck!Do's- Always order a starter. The food can sometimes take a while and the starters are all good I recommend the artichoke fritters or the bacon wrapped dates...- Always ask whether they're close to running out of something, especially on the weekends. I can't tell you how many times they've told me, ""oh we just ran out of this one..."" It's devastating.- Do visit the Paired Wine store right across the street before dinner and pick up a bottle of your favorite wine. It's a cute little wine shop and the staff is really friendly.Don'ts- Avoid coming here with large parties. I've made the mistake one too many times as they're a small venue and you always end up waiting 15-30 minutes past your reservation. - Stick with the traditional American entrees. I made the mistake of ordering the Ramen one time and I was very much wishing I'd ordered a favorite like one of the beef cheek or pork shoulder dishes... It just wasn't quite the ramen you get at a traditional Ramen place and it wasn't as good as one of their other traditional dishes."
"The good: Great atmosphere. Dim lit and cozy, but not too cliche. Some great artwork and music to match. BYOB as well. Service was fast and friendly. The food is fantastic. The portions are a little a tad too small, but I'm a hungry guy. Still, everything was delicious.The bad: The menu is great, but somewhat limited. All of the options are good, but there are only a handful of them. Also, the prices are somewhat high. A little bit more than what I would've liked to pay. Overall: Great little restaurant in a great neighborhood. If you don't mind paying a little extra, it's worth it.Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 9/10Food: 8.5/10"
"Great place. Super friendly, relaxed staff, and it's just so cozy and cute. Had a great girls night here last week, and we enjoyed a long, TGIF-type ordeal.Our food-artichoke and edam frittersalmond-stuffed datesmaple bacon sandwichtroutsalmonmusselstruffle friesi tried everything but the maple bacon sandwich, and it was all wonderful! the almond-stuffed dates were especially delicious (and wrapped in bacon!) and in my opinion, the yelper who said their truffle fries are nothing special was WRONG because we liked them so much, we ordered a second bowl for the table.  the mussels were flavored with anise which gave it a nice twist. between those and the salmon and trout... it was a fun, seafood-y type of dinner. don't forget to BYOB!"
I've been here twice and walked away very impressed each time. One of the better price points for a semi high end restaurant.I'm not sure if it qualifies as a hidden gem since it is one of the most popular restaurants on Yelp in Lakeview but it is a restaurant that I regret not going to more.
"I was really excited to try this place based on all the good reviews, but I just wasn't impressed by it.  The restaurant is very cute and cozy, plus they're BYOB.  The service we received was great...but unfortunately the food was just not memorable.We had the pork belly as an appetizer, and it was a bit salty and could have been more tender.  Also had the almond stuffed dates...also just okay. I believe that we had the pasta and some type of lamb dish for the entree. It might have been an off day for them, but I don't think I'll be coming back. It was a bit on the pricey side as well."
"WOW!!! Best brunch I'be ever had. I had the Kimchee, my friends had the chorizo and the breakfast sandwich. I tasted all of them and there wasn't a bad choice among us. Chill vibe, friendly owners. Great Place!"
"I'm over the tragic chic of moving a restaurant into an abandoned building and just getting rid of the rats! 5 on a Saturday night at opening and we were placed on the observation deck. (Display window) If your going to use that as a draw. Then you need to wash the windows. As I sat and watched the peeling paint on the walls, (Literally) I was expecting dinner to be an outstanding follow up to the brunch we had here. Right! It was 46 degrees outside and 60 inside. I went to wash my hands in the only washroom they had it was a mess. Cracked sink, I stepped on the toilet paper as I tried to close the door as it was so tight. I felt like I walked into the alley. And yes. It was even colder in the loo. Our server told us about the braised beef rib corn dogs. They came with a sweet chutney sauce. Delicious! I felt the need for some greens, so we ordered the Caesar. I love cheese. But the first fork full completely dried out my mouth. The cheese covered everything and was thicker on the bottom. It absorbed all the dressing. That really didn't seem like there was too much of to begin with. I had to take a drink with every bite. And the 4 white bread croutons were a joke! Ordering the meatloaf special, I thought was a safe bet. It was a salt lick on a plate. I could feel my heart racing with every bite. The kale that was severed with it, was marinated in vinegar which I love. But again. Too much of a good thing. As I brought the fork up to my mouth, the vinegar took my breath away as it was so strong. The service was great. But I didn't come here for that and as such, I will make better dining decisions in the future. Even the bartender at Sidetrack questioned our dinner choice before we came here."
"We met an out of town friend who was staying nearby and decided on the spur of the moment to try Home Bistro on a Saturday night. It was about 6 pm and even though we did not have reservations they found us a table for 3. The space is small, but charming and the service was very pleasant and attentive without being intrusive (which can be tricky in a smaller restaurant). For appetizers our friend had the caesar salad and my husband and I had the artichoke and edam fritters with roasted garlic aioli.  The salad was a generous portion for a starter and the fritters were excellent- crispy on the outside and firm/creamy on the inside. The aioli was garlicky and really complimented the cheese of the fritters. For entrees my husband had the buttermilk fried chicken sandwich with a spicy sauce and pickles. It came with thin cut fries. He said it was crunchy and delicious. Our friend had the mussels in a harissa spiced broth  with Belgian-style frites. The portion was very generous for both the seafood and the fries, but it was the harissa broth that really made this dish. It imparted a smokey, spicy essence to the mussels that lingered on the palate with just a touch of heat. There were enough mussels that he shared with me, even though they were so good he wanted to just keep eating!I had the scallops with tamarind pico de gallo and again, everything was delicious. The scallops were perfectly seared on the outside, but not overcooked and the pico provided a slightly fruity heat. There was another brush of sauce on the plate but I can't recall what it was, but it complimented the seafood and pico. It was served on a bed of wild rice, but the rice did not overpower the main in any way. For dessert we shared a thin slab of dark Belgian chocolate with dried cherries and red pepper. It was a perfect light finish to our meal, which left all of us totally satisfied. All the portions are very well calculated- generous, without being too much to finish, and seemed to align well with the pricing. Home Bistro is BYOB/W but there is a Seven Eleven across the street with a reasonable alcohol selection and we just ran and got a bottle of wine to go with our meal. At first glance some of the menu pairings seemed a little unusual,but after the success of every dish we ordered, we will definitely be back to try some different items next time. Sat right away on a Saturday night, good service, everything we ate was a winner and priced fairly- Home Bistro did everything right for us!"
"This is my favorite neighborhood spot.  The food is amazing!  It's high quality, the flavors are unique and the menu is constantly changing.  Since it's BYOB you can have an amazing 4 star dining experience for a fraction of the cost elsewhere.This has become my local go to spot where I host celebrations, bring relatives and friends from out of town, or just go to enjoy a quite dinner.  Everyone has always loved it!   I have dined in for the Wednesday night Prix Frix - what a deal!  I have dined family style - this tiny restaurant does an amazing job serving large parties and making everyone feel so cozy.  & there was more than enough food brought out in the family style service. Go to Home Bistro.   Bring a bottle of your favorite wine.  Have the almond stuffed dates.   It's a go to for any occasion!"
"My boyfriend and I went on a Wed for their prix fixe special back in February 2014. It was a pretty slow night, with two other tables besides us. Service was ok, they took our orders and they brought our food out, nothing extraordinary. The food was what was really disappointing. We ordered:Apps: Smoked Eggplant and EscargotEntree: Pork Loin special with house made giardiniera and Rainbow Trout with puree, braised cabbage, and eggDessert: Cardamon Panna Cotta and Bread PuddingThe apps were pretty good and so was the bread pudding. The Rainbow Trout sounded interesting but it was just a bunch of random stuff paired together on a plate that didn't go well together (I always like to take a bite with a little of everything on the plate and it was not a good combination). My boyfriend didn't really care for the pork either, it tasted like pork with vinegar, and it was not worth the extra up charge for ordering the special. Lastly, the Cardamon Panna Cotta was horrible, it tasted old, kind of like when you leave pudding in the fridge uncovered for a day and it gets that weird dried out gelatinous texture. There was no way that was freshly made. Also it was too heavy in cardamon flavoring.Because there are so many good reviews, I'm not sure I came on an off day, or they slack on the food prep in the middle of the week. Perhaps some of the other items on the menu might have been hits, who knows, as I will not be back."
Unique and elevated Quincy they squeezed my partner and myself in at the last minute for our anniversary appetizer was great the salads were incredible and almost too pretty to eat the entrées were delicious although the sides could've been warmer and the desert OMG so good!
"5 stars for BYOB.  5 stars for Service - Our waitress couldn't have been nicer.  The food was good but nothing outstanding unfortunately.   The pretzels and the fried mozz for appts were good.  For dinner had the bacon sandwich which was good but nothing amazing.  But that being said I would def go back for the ambience (cute date place), BYOB factor and great service!  And close to Laugh Factory if you need a restaurant before a show."
"Three stars might be generous. I made a reservation here for a birthday dinner and my experience started kind of poorly when we were say 30 minutes after our reservation. Also, the hostess really didn't speak to us at all when we entered the restaurant. After that service got slightly better, as our waiter spent a little time with us. However, the next problem came when they ran out of 3 of the items we ordered(there were 3 of us). No problem, there was plenty of good options on the menu so we picked something else.  Once we received our food everything was delicious, the gnocchi and chicken bratwurst were great, the patatas bravas even better, and pumpkin fritters for dessert!!  Like I said food was great, but I probably wouldn't go back or recommend because of the service."
"I'm a fan of their BYOB brunch.  The biscuits and gravy were a little on the salty side, but overall moist and delicious!"
"The BYOB aspect of this place pushes it to a solid FIVE STAR STATUS. PLUS they take reservations!Our party of six girls had a reservation for 8 pm... and plans to go out after! Dolled up, and with a few bottles of wine tucked into a grocery bag, we strolled into the unassuming door located on the west-side of Halsted Street. A cozy, quaint room that appeared to be lit by candle light appeared before us.We were seated within minutes and began analyzing the menu. Everything was tempting! Unfortunately they had already sold-out of the braised pork. This was not a game-changer for me as I had my eye on the seafood special.We ordered 3 appetizers to pass around the table. They were pretty small, barely a bite per person. The beet salad was my favorite, BUT everything was awesome.As soon as the appetizers were complete, the main course came rolling out- and mine was by far the most spectacular! There were TONS of muscles, some clams, and three large shrimp tucked away in this heaping bowl of amazing-ness.Garnish atop was some pickled-like apples and some other greens. I was skeptical about how they would play into a sea food dish...BUT they complimented it to a 'tee.' The broth was superb and once I was done with all the seafood and had all the shells stacked in a separate bowl, I discovered there was still more! There were these braised, short-rib maybe? nuggets of scrumptious meat underneath all the broth.I tried some of the others' food. The Amsterdam Muscles had a strong anise flavor incorporated into it.  I think that flavor stood out more to me as it was a sharp contrast to the muscles I just digested. I helped finish whatever muscles they could not.The gnocchi with meatballs had almost a dessert-like essence and had an infusion of cinnamon to go with. Also a fantastic choice.We had dessert... I honestly cannot remember what we ordered. Must not have been that memorable. ;)Will I return? You bet."
"Best thing I had... the croutons.I am not saying the food is bad at all. In fact, it was good. However, competing with so many other fantastic restaurants can be tough. I understand. We had the the beef cheek and the braised pork shoulder. We had some kind of salad as well, but really, the croutons were the only thing that won me over. The beef cheek was good, I must say, but everything else seemed a little bland or like something was missing. I do have to mention that it is BYOB, which is fantastic and our server was very pleasant. However, I feel like I was a little disappointed with the meny. Maybe they change the menu every so often and it just wasn't for me this time. I would maybe give it another shot, and hope for the best."
I went to HB Restaurant last night for the first time with my gf for date night.It was just right. The ambiance was intimate and the service was great. The menu was amazing and had so many great looking things I wanted to try.We got the almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates in brown sugar for appetizer and they were delicious.For entrees we got the chicken thigh and pork shank which were perfect.We will definitely be back. It's BYOB which is even better.
"Simply excellent.   Great dining experience.  BYOB for the win.I came here last month without a reservation.  I was surprised and delighted they were able to seat my date and I immediately.  The dining room is very small and intimate, to the point where you feel like you are seated in a private dining room.  BACON WRAPPED DATES = incredible.I ordered the House Smoked Chicken Thighs.  The chicken was melt-in-your-mouth, fall-off-the-bone perfect.  My date ordered the Braised Duroc Pork Shank.  It was also delicious.The service was wonderful.  Our waitress was so nice and attentive.  She had noticed it took longer than usual for our appetizer to arrive, and very sweetly apologized and comped us for the price on our bill.  You don't see that kind of hospitality often, especially at Chicago restaurants.I do not recommend it for large groups or for children due to the small space, but other than that, I really enjoyed Home Bistro and hope to return soon.  It is now officially one of my life goals to try everything on this menu."
"My husband and I were the first customers when we came here for brunch, so we were able to sit by the window; the bistro itself was very cute and quaint; clean, and very cheerful-like.  Both our server and the manager were extremely nice and friendly!  For appetizers, I ordered the side of the small bowl of Parmesan truffle fries and the Brown Sugar Bacon.  The Parmesan truffle fries were warm but I could hardly taste the truffle, even if it was a slight hint.  It came with a side of ketchup. The brown sugar bacon was not overly sweet, but I was a little disappointed as the bacon themselves were very thin and small.  For the main entree, I ordered the Uitsmijter, which was a Dutch-style plate, that came with two slices of brioche toast, ham steak that was 'griddle-seared,' edam cheese, one sunnyside up egg (my favorite way of preparation of eggs), and a light vinaigrette-dressed rocket leafed/arugula salad.  The brioche were thin, and the ham steak was quite thick - it was a nicely salted baked ham.  The salad was nice as it was very simple and fresh, and I liked the light vinaigrette dressing.  My husband ordered the Slow Braised Corned Beef Hash, which came with two eggs over easy and a buttermilk biscuit with strawberry butter in a little ramekin.  His 'corned beef' was more like my ham steak - thick slices and slightly underseasoned.  The strawberry butter was very nice and complemented well with the toast.  He did find a piece of wire in his dish, so that was a little unpleasant!  We were glad to check this restaurant out in Boystown! :D+Uitsmijter+check your dish for foreign objects! T___T"
"Very small, intimate restaurant. Service was great, they're very friendly and make a home-like atmosphere. Not good for big groups. Make reservations early! We went late and a few entrees were out already.BYOB! No corkage fee. Fresh food, good portion sizes. The Artichoke and Edam Fritters are a must for an appetizer, which we got for free because we waited even though we made reservations. We also ordered truffle fries on the side, which were pretty good, but DMK burger bar still has the best truffle fries I've had so far in Chicago.The duck is amazing. Tried the salmon too which was cooked on point, crispy on top. Don't recommend the pork compared to the other two. I wanted to try the chicken but they were out. Too full for dessert, but I heard the bread pudding is a must have.Overall good restaurant! I'd come here again."
"I was really pumped to try HB - as I had heard so many good things!  It's a really cute little place, I would suggest making reservations as it's not a big space and could fill up pretty quickly.I tried making a reservation online, but the time I wanted wasn't available.  I called, and they were super cool about squeezing us in!  We brought a bottle of win for the 4 of us and started off with some fried oysters and homemade italian sausage.  They were both SO good.  This was the first time I have had fried oysters, and I've been craving them since.For dinner I opted for the gnocchi, the other three got the trout, one of the specials, and the chicken thighs.  Every single person was satisfied beyond belief with what they had ordered.  OH! And we got an order of the truffle fries too.  I would recommend getting some to split, just because they're that good.I love this little place and was really impressed with the quality of food- price point- and the friendly server and manager. Excited to go back."
"truffle fries tasted like fries minus the truffle. I couldn't taste the truffle, and neither did anyone else in my party of 4. amsterdam style mussels were good, not great. keep in mind they include 2 anise stars in the broth, and if you don't like that taste, you can request it without or with just 1. we ordered the sauteed garlic and escargot appetizer (again, good but not great) and the artichoke and edam fritters, which was a bit dry but the aioli made up for it. however, I'm not sure if I would order them again because it lacked the wow factor. my lbcgt on 7 grain, a lamb-bacon cabbage green tomato sandwich, left me baffled. how can you eat a blt without the b? they later brought out the l-bacon on a separate plate and apologized for forgetting it. oh okay.I have to admit, their service was on pointe. we were late for our reservations, but they held the table for us anyways. the polite waitress informed us about the byob policy and even gave us suggestions on nearest places to buy wine. the food came out rather quickly, and our glasses never reached half empty. impressive!hb, thank you for having a great staff, but please make some adjustments to your food."
"Arrived on time for my reservation, was told, ""Oh, it'll just be a minute,"" then waited 20 minutes and still wasn't seated. Place was really loud too, probably because they have too many tables cramped together. Finally left without any apology from the hostess."
This place is amazing!  The food is very original and the specials are always good!  The wait staff is really nice and will help you find a place to grab booze to BYO just in case you didn't plan ahead!
"Ordered trout, bacon wrapped dates and chicken. One star given to food taste and environment. Terribly loud (music) in this small place, had to scream all night so friend and server could hear what I said. And I believe because everybody has to scream out so it makes it so much noise in the whole place. The unusual F word in my head whole night long.....had to get out as soon as we were done with the meal. I wish I could leave no tips!!Sorry I'm not a fan."
"I was going to give it 4 stars but I find myself still thinking about the great meal I had here. It was absolutely delicious! What we had:Almond Stuffed Dates - Yes! Get them. They tasted like Christmas... get them and you'll know what I mean.Coriander Crusted Salmon - probably the best cooked Salmon I've ever had. And this is a healthier option.I'd recommend trying the Rushing Waters Rainbow Trout, we didn't have it but the table next to us did and they said it was amazing.The Lamb meatballs were good, but not the most memorable dish of the night. There's no wine/alcohol, but the waiter suggested we go to 7/11 across the street to get something as it's BYOB. We got wine and were perfectly content in saving money."
"Not as good as I expected and hoped for.  We had the buffalo fried sweetbreads, which we ""meh"", and one of them was EXTREMELY tough....we also had the artichoke and edam fritters, and the entire batch was undercooked....inside of fritters was all wet dough.  Entrees were the buffalo chicken sandwich and seared scallops....the element of the ""smoked"" chicken, really took away from how good the sandwich could have been.  The scallops were small and extremely salty, almost inedible......doubt we'd try it again."
"This place is SO GOOD! It's reasonably priced, with food that has variety. Staff is very nice, the restaurant itself is small so make reservations. It's also byob so grab a bottle of wine and go give it a try. One of my favorite restaurants in Chicago."
"Excellent meal! We all had different entrees that were all spectacular. The bread pudding was a great end to our meal. Also, it's a byob which is awesome!"
"I was a little hesitant to come here at first because nothing on the menu screamed MUST TRY to me, but I came here with a couple of girlfriends on a Friday night because they heard rave reviews of HB and it's BYOB, which is always a plus. We decided to share the artichoke edam fritters and almond-stuffed dates as appetizers and they were really tasty! The fritters were nice and crispy and the almond stuffed dates were wrapped in bacon and covered in brown sugar so they salty yet sweet and really hit the spot. My friends ordered the maple bacon sandwich, rainbow trout, and coriander crusted salmon and I split the ""Amsterdam Style"" mussels with another friend. My friends' dishes were really good from the bites that I stole, but I didn't really like the mussels dish. They were seasoned with anise, which was really off-putting to me because I'm used to that smell and taste when I eat my parents' pho and was rather disappointed that I was eating mussels instead. Luckily, the dish came with truffle fries that were fried to perfection and came with a garlic aioli dipping sauce, which I'm a HUGE sucker for. They were so delicious that our table asked for another order! Overall, I thought the ambiance of the restaurant and quality of food was great even though I didn't really care for my mussels. I definitely hope to return in the future since their menu changes seasonally and everything we ordered was well-prepared, homey, and delicious!"
"The food was amazing here.  The restaurant is tiny, but honors reservations which makes it convenient to get into.  Friendly staff.  Excellent service.  Definitely worth a return."
"What's in a name? In this case. A lot. HB stands for Home Bistro. You get the bistro vibe from the stylish decor, candlelight, and elegant furnishings. The Home aspect that it's so small, cozy, and the service is very welcoming and never contrived, rushed, or executes missteps. The establishment epitomizes both names.And did I mention it's BYOB?I've been here several times and it's always consistent. I'm by no means a Dutch food expert but it seems authentic with a contempory twist. Since I've been several times I will only highlight my faves:The breadDon't laugh, it's good and you'll need it later to sop up some of the sauces.Almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates baked with brown sugarA must order! Unless you're a vegetarian or have dietary restrictions; then order and give to me, then get the hell away.Amsterdam style mussels in beer broth, anise, dried basil, garlic and served with truffle frites.Their signature dish. It's good. The portions are large.Trout special with veggies and I believe cous cous or risotto/riceHe found the portion small and the flavors monotonous. I liked the taste and presentation.The menu is small and specials change quite often. I feel for me there's an element of risk ordering since some items seem exotic. Further, it'd be difficult to ask for substitutions with out fear you'd destroy the integrity of the dish (since most are complex).However, I recommend it as an adorable spot for a date or friend session. And like that they take nicer and unique cuisine and present it in an accessible way. Lives up to the name!"
I very much enjoy this place. Their dinners are delicious and I personally love the Truffle oiled fries. And I do like that I can bring wine to dinner. As a BYOB establishment...they are very gracious to open the bottle for you. Highly recommended based on my great experiences.
"This place is a MUST when you are in Lakeview! It is a must even if you live in a different STATE! The food is really authentic and locally sourced to boot - the chef is really creative and makes all the flavor profiles really share the space and compliment each other in the dish. We don't normally order the 'special' at restaurants, but at Home Bistro the special is the BEST meal in the place that day! Make sure to step out of your comfort zone with at least one choice as well because you will be pleasantly surprised with what the chef can open your eyes to! Oh - and make sure you come accompanied by your favorite bottle of wine or choice of beer because the establishment is BYOB."
"I have been to HB numerous times, and have yet to be disappointed. This neighborhood gem has a fantastic staff, excellent menu, and never leaves me hungry. You're basically nuts if you haven't been here yet.Oh yeah, if you haven't read anything else, know that you have to BYOB!"
Great food. Pure and simple which is saying a lot for a city with so many options. Chef Victor lays it out man. I'll keep stop here every time I'm in town on a shoot.
"Wow. What an amazing little restaurant. First off, every time I see any cuisine labeled ""American""- new or traditional, I'm hesitant. Why? Because I've been let down so many times. But let me say, if all American restaurants tasted like this, I'm all in.Food: fried oysters with polenta (our least favorite, but the polenta was magical), baby beet salad (fresh great quality beats, but the dish is pretty small, especially for 10 dollars)Ok here's what gets the five stars- their chicken thigh special (I NEVER order chicken at restaurants, but oh my god all the components of the dish were fabulous!!!!  Such attention to detail, it was delicious) & the lamb breast (not my favorite cut of lamb but once again all the sauces/garnishes/components were completely amazing) & Amsterdam mussels with truffle fries- my dad said it was the BEST oysters he's ever had (& he's definitely an oyster man)Panda cotta- definitely extremely yummy but not like ""died & went to heaven""-food overall: 4.5. Get the entrees! They're to die for. Get them and split them with everyone.-service: 5 (the owner/server was super friendly and sweet, always smiling and extremely attentive; the busser was so sweet and my water was ALWAYS full- which is of the upmost importance)-atmosphere: 4.5 (a little too dark, for a meal thaaaat yummy, I'd rather see ;) )"
"Absolutely phenomenal! We stumbled upon it by comparing two yelp reviews and a stranger behind us said to go here! Amazing pork belly hash, breakfast sandwich, mussels, and panne cotta with rhubarb and lime zest. Best dessert I've had in my life. Chef came out to greet us and their staff was amazing!!! I'm telling all of my friends to come here when visiting Chicago :)"
"*3.5 StarsThis is my friend's favorite place in Chicago, so he insisted I try it. We went on a Sunday night, and unforunately the kitchen had run out of a few dishes. One being the mussels that my friend had raved about.1. Duck Rillete: This was a really good appetizer, but I am a sucker for any type of meat smear. To me, it is really hard to mess up any kind of rillete/pate etc. The cracker/flatbreads that came with the rillete were a really good vehicle for the smean, adn the mustard seed spread was vert flavorful, but not overly. I am not the biggest fan of mustard seeds, so the fact that I was smearing it on so generously says a lot.2. Meatloaf (special of the night) - This probably had to be my least favorite dish of the night. The meatloaf was cooked very well, with a nice sear to it , and the accompanying roasted brussel sprouts were good. I think where the dish went wrong for me was that it was a little overly salty (and this is coming from someone who loves salty foods, and usually complains that food is too bland), also I think that a warm mashed potatoes would have worked much better with the dish than a cool parsnip/cauliflower puree. Sometimes it is just best to keep it simple, the puree had an odd taste to it.3. Pork Cheeks Stew - I loved this dish, just the right amount of richness in the broth/soup. The pork cheeks were so tender. In this instance I think the parsnip/cauliflower puree worked well with the pork cheeks. All of the ingredients of the dish worked well together. This place is BYOB, it is a very relaxed environment, with service that is just the right amount of attentiveness (not hovering, but still checks in on you). We had such a great time at dinner that we literally shut the place down.I think should they had not run out of some of the dishes I wanted to try, this place could have been a solid 4 stars."
"So, this BYOB place is right on trend.  For an appetizer, I choose the fried oysters. My fiance failed to hold my attention b/c I was in food heaven bite after bite. Fried Oysters are tricky, and this place nailed it.  For dinner, we both opted for the pork shoulder. I have never had this dish before. It was a huge portion (although delicious) and I did end up taking the rest home.Of course, I could not resist exploring the dessert menu. I excitingly ordered the crème brûlée. It came in a deep dish with 7 creamy layers.The crispy caramelized top was perfection. As I reached the bottom, my taste buds were presently surprised with a pallet change of spicy dark chocolate and a hint of lime. Needless to say there was nothing left!  I would have taken a picture but my phone was unable to capture it in the lighting. ( I am a huge fan of food porn. )Reservations are a must, the place is not very large. If your are making a night of it,  I do recommend staying at the Majestic Hotel which is an easy walking distance from Halsted st. majestic-chicago.comfacebook.com/pages/HB-Ho…You are what you eat! So, eat only the best ;)Nikki Hoppe"
"At first glance: writing on the walls and sponge-like painting was a little reminiscent of a cheap Italian bistro, and they'd be better off without table cloths than covering the tables with paper that annoyingly drops down to your knees. Service was cheerful but extremely casual; I really enjoyed our server but she was not dressed for the occasion. Far too informal in jeans and a t-shirt. Arrived at 7 PM to a quiet restaurant; by 7:45 the place was jumpin' and borderline rowdy. It was LOUD by the time we left.At first taste: fried soft-boiled egg starter was underwhelming. I would have much preferred the bed of zucchini ""spaghetti"" and other vegetables to be served hot like the egg instead of cold. Surprisingly spicy.Chorizo and clams main was a 10. Props on that. Polenta was perfectly creamy; the sauce so good I did my best to scrape the plate clean, damning the fact that I didn't have a spoon to get the rest.Pork shoulder main was also delicious, but a little too much like a Thanksgiving meal in July for my taste. Sub the pork with turkey and the raspberries with cranberries and you've got all the flavors of fall -- not midsummer. Regardless, the entire plate was happily devoured.Cinnamon-roll bread pudding for dessert was a huge, heaping portion of bread and cream in danger of tipping off of its little plate. I much prefer to savor my desserts than stuff myself with them, but we did some damage on it anyway and left satisfied.BYOB is a huge plus. Overall, there's some room for improvement but they're on the right track with their mains."
"Definitely one of the best, most flavorful meals I've had in a very long time. My friends and I split multiple dishes. My personal highlights included the escargot, endive salad, rainbow trout, and their special of the day: oxtail stew? The flavors of every dish blended perfectly and had extreme depth. The flavors were unique yet comforting. We finished the meal off with a perfect dense bread pudding. This restaurant is cozy, delicious, and BYOB. Honestly, does it get any better?"
"My best friend raves about this place...so sometimes you have to humor friends!  We showed up on a weeknight without a reservation and they got us a larger table without a wait, even though our whole party wasn't at the restaurant yet.  The food was superb, but it came out just a little slowly.  Definitely go for the Bacon-wrapped Dates! I'm not sure how often the menu changes, but the current ramen dish and beef-cheek chili were huge hits at our table.  Make sure to remember to BYOB!"
"Thanks to my niece for getting me a gift card for here. Regular hours they do not open until 5pm, Sunday morning nothing going on why not go here for Brunch. There was only a few people here. Brunch runs from 11-2 and a decent variety to choose from. I was eyes up the tacos filled with pork shoulder and scrambled eggs, just sounded yummy. Then i looked down and spotted the Johnny Cakes. Brought back memories of the Soprano's episode. Had to go for them. Very good choice for sure. The whipped goat cheese was tasty as was the fruit. The side order of bacon was a good choice to. Not a bad place, service was good. I will be back to sample more."
This place is amazing! We had brunch here a few weeks ago and It was delicious!  The service was excellent. I would recommend this place always. I have not been to dinner yet but definitely trying it soon.
HB is the go-to birthday restaurant for my family.  We were most recently there for my birthday in early May and it was delicious.  The highlight of the meal was the chicken sausage.  It was melt in your mouth amazing! The trout and salmon were also great.The bread pudding is also a perfect ending to the meal. I have also enjoyed brunch at HB and it was just as good.  BYOB is a huge plus to the little restaurant.  Bring your own bubbles for brunch or a nice bottle (or 3) for dinner.  I can't wait to go back!
"Not your typical Friday night boys town destination, this place is a cozy warm getaway with really yummy food.  My best friend loves this place, and he has now got me hooked on it too.  Book ahead, because chances are that if you don't you'll be out of luck on dinner because reservations fill up fast on a Friday night!  It's a really cute, down to earth atmosphere with really affordable food and sizeable portions for the dinner entrees.  I get the mussels and fries almost every time.  The mussels are nice and plump and drenched in a garlic beer broth sauce that is really delicious.   It comes in this massive bowl, that you think you'll never be able to finish.... Yet I always do, it's that good!! And the mussels are accompanied by truffle fries.... Need I say more?The dinner menu is pretty consistent, though they always have a couple specials, which have always been really good as well. The dessert menu changes each time.   I've tried a chocolate/nut berry array... It wasn't my favorite.  But my thoughts about the dessert were well forgotten after we finished our own bottle of wine from napa.   Yes, this place lets you bring your own wine!  Needless to say, Byob makes everything better."
I had a delicious smoked chicken and apple hash for brunch which deserved 5 stars.  HOWEVER my friend's potato pancake with turnips and pickled cabbage was disappointing - the flavors and textures didn't go together.   They should have replaced the turnips with something green - it was root vegetable overload!  Also they don't have an expresso machine :( & the decor is uninspiring.   But my chicken dish was amazing!!
"I went into HB really wanting to like it, I was hoping for the best. We tried the $33 three course Wednesday special. The pistachio pesto on the small portion of beet salad tasted like creamed birdseed. The eggplant app was okay, the bread on it tasted like it was from jewel. The potato 'patata' appetizer sounded delicious and interesting but came to the table in the guise of bad hash browns. Totally underwhelming. The rainbow trout had nice crispy skin and was fairly good. The busser was attentive to our water needs, unfortunately he put his hands all over the lip of our glasses, it was just kind of gross. For the money, this place is a big disappointment. Our server was the only redeeming quality. The view is also really depressing."
"It's the same set up as girl and the goat, where you get a buncha small dishes for everyone to share, however the portions here were way bigger which is good, in total we all had rabbit, spaetzles, bread pudding, almond cake, choc cake, sweetbread, artichoke fritters, bacon wrapped dates, cheese, oysters, cant say anything bad about any of them, idk if I can pick a favorite, BYOB which is nice, kinda pricy but good for a special occasion"
"Made us wait almost an hour and we had a reservation. No regard for customer service or making us feel welcome and make up for the bad service. Never got seated, not that hostess or anyone there cared. Extremely bad service. Do not recommend not matter how ""cozy"" people tell you the place is. Never ever going beak there."
"Outstanding food, warm decor, very cozy, and BYOB(!). Our server was very helpful and attentive and, really, just a pleasure to be around. I could gush about this place endlessly, but there's little more to say than if you're thinking about coming here for a date, friends/parents out of town, or even just by yourself, you will not be disappointed."
"I'm so torn, this place is one of my friend's all time favorite eats in Boystown and he was excited to take me there. I really wanted to be able to come home and write a stellar review...Let's start with the good (and the good was indeed good). It's BYOB, to some a positive; I'm a Californian and I still haven't quite grasped the concept of BYOB (it seems weird), but I will try to get on board with the Chicagoan excitement of it. They were offering a prix fixe deal (appetizer, soup/salad, and entree) that was an awesome bargain. Between the two of us we got to eat a lot of food! I like that. I had the artichoke edam fritters with roasted garlic aioli, the Belgium endive salad, and the mussels and truffle fries. My friend had the almond stuffed dates, the Caesar salad and the special of the night - sausage over something (I can't remember the description). Our bill for both was $70 (pretty good deal for the amount of food you get). Let's break it down:artichoke fritters - ok, but very bland. I don't like my food salty, but I seriously wanted to add some salt to these. They were big and kinda fun to break apart with your fingers. almond stuffed dates - they were good, better than the fritters, but average at best. endive salad was exceptional! It included pears, goat cheese, pork jowl lardons, and a creamy walnut dressing. I would have been happy to end the meal here. Ok maybe the salad and a sample of their bread pudding! The salad was the best part of the meal and I would go back to try the other great salad combinations. mussels - oh man, they were the worst I have ever had. They were piled high in a small bowl so most of them weren't submerged in the yummy beer broth, they got cold fast, many were still closed and more than half of the ones opened did not look friendly. I only ate about a 1/4 of the bowl before I pushed them aside. One of my favorite things about mussels is the big ass bowl, the delicious broth to dip a hunk of bread into and steaming mussels that go down smooth. I got none of that here. truffle fries - omg, so addictive and good! Crispy, thin, tasteful. The staff is amazeballs and attentive and funny and kind. The place is cozy, candlelit and in a great location to start an evening out in Boystown. I would like to go back and try some other items because the menu is creative and well thought out. Everyone has an off night and I am more than willing to give HB another go at it."
"What a lovely dinner we had a HB Restaurant!  We met two Yelp friends there who had luckily gotten a reservation and we were seated in the corner in a comfortable table.  The space is very small but luckily tables are adequately spaced.  The marvelous thing about this restaurant is that it is BYOB and in our case, BYOC - our table companions had brought two bottles of Champagne, only my favorite!  The restaurant chilled it, served it, provided glasses and a bucket for it on the table.  We had just amazing service as well.We were feeling fun and festive so we ordered two apps - their deviled eggs and their anchovies, yeah!  The eggs were the bigger hit, great flavors and a just a bit of texture on top.I ordered the lamb meatballs for my main course and I have to stop being seduced by the word lamb, although I have had lamb meatballs other places and liked them.  I was so sadly underwhelmed by my plate.  The bed of polenta was so bland, and nothing in the dish had much flavor.  Boo hoo for me as everyone else adored their entree and were nice enough to let me taste them.  Delicious duck!  Fabulous mussels!  Mouthwatering pork!    I had a bad case of menu envy.  I cheered myself up with coffee and half, okay more than half, of a walnut and something else crisp.  So delicious.  All these positives and just my entree as the only not so great moment in an otherwise really fantastic night.  It might not be my strongest five, but I gotta go with a five star rating!"
"Sometimes I wonder what makes a restaurant excellent: is it characteristics of the restaurant or is it the company sharing your table? Perhaps an intricate combination of both? Well, for me, my food from HB was outstanding, our party of four conquered two bottles of champagne, and our company was glowing.M and I met up with fellow Yelpers Kathleen M and Clifford S. Getting there was easy for me and M. We just took the 36 bus north and (due to construction) it was redirected along Halsted and dropped us off across the street from our destination. Kathy and Cliff had a harder time of it - their driving commute was an hour and a half from the southern suburbs. I don't know what they did about parking.We all shared two appetizers: something with anchovies and deviled eggs. The anchovy appetizer came on a toothpick: anchovy, pickled pepper, and mozzarella cheese. The pepper really overpowered everything else. We were all surprised that we liked it as much as we did, but I doubt that anybody would choose to have an encore. The deviled eggs were my favorite - and I hate eggs. I probably liked them because the flavor was smokey and not any bit like eggs. That's actually the reason why M was less impressed - she prefers her eggs to taste like eggs.Our entrees were all pretty varied: pork for Cliff, lamb meatballs for Kathy, mussels for M, and duck for me. Cliff's pork was falling off the bone because it was so tender. He seemed to enjoy it quite a bit. Kathy's meatballs weren't so great. She really disliked the polenta and she only ate one of her two meatballs. M and I both really enjoyed her mussels. They had lovely seasoning and did not taste fishy or dirty at all. But it was my duck that was really the shining star of the entrees. My duck had a crusty sear on top and was rare or medium rare in the middle. The flavor and texture were phenomenal. I also loved the side. I'm not sure what it was but it reminded me of gnocchi.Kathy and Cliff shared a walnut berry crisp dessert and M and I shared an apricot bread pudding. Kathy and Cliff really didn't say anything about their dessert. Our bread pudding was burnt on the bottom and my favorite part was the apricots.Our service was okay. Our server was kind enough to chill one bottle of champagne in the kitchen while providing an ice bucket at the table for the other. The people who came to our table were all friendly. We were impressed that our server remembered the specials while simultaneously pouring our champagne. I thought that they could have checked on us more often and also cleared away the regular wine glasses that cluttered our table. After all, we had both champagne and wine glasses on our table for nearly the entire evening.The ambiance of the restaurant was rather casual and intimate. The space is small and noisy. The lighting was dim. The decor was a bit rustic and artsy, but nice. Some photographs were on the wall that were taken by one of the owners of HB. I thought the bathroom smelled like fish.Our bill came to about $75 per couple. M thought that was good. In fact, she commented that she would enjoy going back there again and either ordering the duck or trying another entree. I'd say that the evening was really splendid for me as I got the benefit of good company and a scrumptious entree. I wonder if the evening might have been improved a bit for everyone else if the restaurant was just a hair more consistently luminous."
"We had plans to meet Yvonne and M here which was the good part, the bad part was that I had looked the restaurant up on Yelp and read that there was no Valet parking.  Luckily, we were able to find a metered spot about two blocks away.  You can only pay the meter for two hours which had expired by the time we got back to our car.  The parking gods were in our favor, however, as we did not have a ticket.  I mention this because if you can arrive via cab or public transportation, it might make your night a little easier.  Coming from the southwest suburbs, this was not an option for us.The restaurant is small, almost but not quite too small.  I appreciated not having a table placed immediately next to mine but navigating getting to and from the table was not the easiest.  We all had to make a trip to the ""library"" so this was a small issue.Our server was friendly and quick, good about explaining things and very helpful with the bottles of champagne our table companions had brought.  This was really a big plus because at a BYOB, these beverages did not increase the bill or tip.  Take that into consideration when you tip, you got a service which isn't reflected in the bill.I had the pork shank which was fall off the bone tender. It came with really delicious German potato salad.  I also got to eat one of my wife's meatballs so I was very happy with the food.  For appetizers we had the eggs and the anchovies.  Again, I liked these the best so I got a lion's share.  I am not even a big fan of anchovies but the really spicy pickled part made the dish for me.   Only fair then that when dessert arrived, I didn't really care for the crisp that much so I only had a few tries and left it for my wife.  The food here is easily a five, the overall rating of four is based on the size of the restaurant, the noisiness which made conversation a bit challenging and the lack of valet parking.  If I lived nearby and lost about a foot of height, this would be a five for sure.  We'll call it a four point five."
"Great BYOB in Boystown / Lakeview.  Come here for a solid date night.The lady Tarra T. and I wanted to venture a bit out of our neighborhood and had some newly purchased bottles of wine to dive into, so the stars pointed us towards HB.Atmosphere: great, low lighting is perfect for intimate dinners and the small, cozy dining room creates a warmth that is well balanced by the floor to ceiling windows that open out onto Halsted.Food: the almond-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates are quite delectable (that description is a mouthful, almost as good as the dates themselves).  The whitefish is a straight up winner for entree.  But Tarra and I both agree - you can probably pass on the lamb.  Was just a bit too salty for us, and the gnocchi was a bit underwhelming.All in all, definitely worth a visit this summer if you're looking for a place to try."
"My wife and I could not have been more impressed with the meal we recently enjoyed at HB. We started with the bacon wrapped dates which were served with a crispy, crumbly brown sugar and stuffed with almonds. While a bit on the sweet side to start things off, they were delicious and we could have easily polished off a couple dozen.We had trouble picking entrees because there were a number we wanted to try but landed on the pork shank and one of the night's specials, a veal Marsala pasta dish. We shared the two dishes and both were phenomenal! The pork shank was expertly cooked and fell off the bone with the touch of a fork. It was served with a delicious apple smear, a cold sweet potato mash and very acidic sautéed kale and onions. We both loved the mash and thought the kale and onions was a bit heavy on the vinegar, but the apple smear went so well with the pork that we actually ran out quite quickly.The veal marsala was the star of the night! Neither one of us wanted to give up the perfectly prepared dish. The veal was prepared like pork belly and served over pasta with figs, mushrooms and a flavorful sauce. It was absolutely perfect!The service friendly and attentive without being overbearing. At one point we asked for more apple smear, and after a few minutes she came back and told us the chef was running low and was a bit flustered at the moment. We thought that sounded a bit odd but continued enjoying the rest of the meal regardless. Then as we were waiting to hear about dessert, one of the other servers drops a whip cream covered bread pudding on our table! Turns out our server felt bad about the apple smear and made up for it with dessert on the house! It was a cinnamon roll bread pudding that we quickly devoured, and was a decadent end to our fabulous meal."
I don't remember what my friend and I ordered for our appetizers/entrees but they were tasty. What I DO remember ordering is HB's amazing bread pudding. I brought the rest of my leftovers home for the husband and told him that he could have the rest of my entree but he wasn't allowed to touch my dessert!The space is a little tight but the delicious food and friendly service made up for it!
"I have been wanting to go here since it was recommended by a friend and then saw all the good reviews. It lived up to the hype, which I was happy. I decided to take my friends from Detroit here. There are great small culinary gems in Detroit and wanted to show my friends possibly the same quality here in Chicago. I did not have reservations but figured it was a Thursday night and thought to try it. They sat us right away with no problem. The waiter was casual and adorable with his description of the specials. We started with the bacon wrapped dates and artichoke fritters, both were ok. My two friends were sold on the gnocchi with sausage, banana peppers, figs and blue cheese. I stuck to the menu and got the pork. Everything was so flavorful and filling. I had left overs. The entree would have been enough for me. I wish I had room for dessert. I can't wait to go back!"
"Had an excellent experience here last night!!! Everything from the initial greeting to the mouth watering food and wait service throughout dinner...HB was top notch.  I enjoyed the amazing fried oysters with polenta and bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates to start, Atlantic salmon for my main dish, and ended the evening with some chocolate bark made in house.  To top it off the restaurant is BYOB and conveniently located across from a 7-11 for easy access. Quaint atmosphere.  Can't wait to go back and try some other inventive menu items with my boyfriend on a date night and even a Sunday Brunch with friends!"
"Great atmosphere and quaint locale. Food was spectacular. The Wednesday prefix menu for $33-38 is absolutely perfect! I would definitely recommend reservations as the place was getting filled up fast around 7:00. Escargot and Homemade Italian appetizer are both supreme and bursting with flavor. The special last night was Prince Edward Island mussels in a white wine cream sauce - superb! The braised lamb breast which is a regular feature from the menus is just so tender and moist, it is like butter. The wait staff was super friendly and on top of it! Will definitely go back! BYOB feature is also perfect - there is no uncorking fee!"
"Delicious food and no corkage fee for BYOB. What could be better? Sweetbreads and the almond-stuffed dates were awesome, as was my salmon. My friends and I all loved our dishes, to the point of not sharing with each other, but everything they had looked great. Desserts were good, but a little heavy on the spices. The restaurant is charming, and the service was consistently attentive. I'll definitely go back!"
"And my 300th Yelp! review goes to....HB!  I couldn't think of any place I would've rather been on a cold, snowy Friday night in Chicago than HB.  I'll admit, I was expecting a little more with all the 5 star reviews, but that doesn't mean I wasn't impressed.  The space is very small and low-lit, perfect for an intimate dinner date with your significant other or just a cozy dinner with friends.  I called a couple days in advance to make a reservation for 2-highly recommend.We started with the infamous Almond-Stuffed, Bacon-Wrapped Dates....yummm!  Order these, don't think about it, just do it.  I don't really like dates but I guess when you wrap them in bacon and bake them in brown sugar I do!  Because we couldn't pick just one app, we also tried the Sauteed Garlic & Escargot.  These are not your typical swimming in butter, garlic overload escargot.  It was a much lighter but very flavorful take on escargot and I thoroughly enjoyed them.For my main I went with the HUGE plate of ""Amsterdam Style"" Mussels.  I have never ordered just mussels at a restaurant but I went with it at HB because so many reviewers raved about them.  The amount of mussles you get is crazy, I wasn't even close to finishing them.  They are served over top of a tasty broth and you also get a side of fries with truffle dipping sauce.  These fries, oh my gosh these fries.  Very thin fries, crispy on the outside but soft on the inside, with some tasty salt on top...these were soooo good.  And the truffle ""sauce"" on the side was fantastic.  I wonder if you could just order these as a side for another dish??  Highly, highly recommend.We finished off the meal with the bread pudding, I believe when we went it was Cranberry & Vanilla.  Very, very good...perfect way to end the meal.  As if the great food alone wasn't enough...they are BYOB so you can have a very nice dinner out without breaking the bank!"
Went here with some friends for a birthday. I love that it's BYOB. The food is tasty. Generous portions of the mussels and fries (and the fries had the perfect amount of crisp). Desserts were the only disappointment.
"Great food, was arriving late with coworkers, and they were willing to stay open past their normal time. Our waiter was super friendly and helpful. The tomato and cheese salad was great and really fresh tasting. The lamb burger was a bit gamey for me,  and I generally love anything lamb. The pork belly was awesome and I'd go back just for that. Located in the heart of boys town, so sit by the window if you like some very interesting people watching. Would definitely return."
The truffle fries were so good! The truffle aioli sauce enhanced the truffle flavor in the fries and made them addicting.  I usually don't like salmon usually since it's dry and rough but the waitress told me that the chef likes to cook it medium rare and that sold me. Now I know how to order my salmon. I don't usually hear the option of cooking salmon medium rare/well. The lamb sweetbread was really odd to me though. It was very acquired and tasted like gizzard or something. The bread pudding was delicious too. My friend and I both thought it tasted like it had apple in it which I think it was from the hint of cinnamon. I am definitely coming back for the truffle fries.
"I have to say I originally thought the ratings were too high for this restaurant however each time I return the food gets better.  I'm in the neighborhood and this place is a go to for me but recently the food has really stepped up.  I took a bit of a hiatus from the place due to Wood opening up even closer to my home (Wood is wonderful) but I have returned to Home Bistro as of last week and the food was better than ever.  My wife and I ordered the pork cheek and the gnocchi special.  Both were absolutely fantastic.  We enjoyed the artichoke fritters and the corn salad to start our meals and they were both fantastic as well.  Our server was very friendly with some great suggestions so we share some of our wine with him.  This is a solid place to go during the week for a nice dinner or take a dinner party to for groups of about 6.  Smaller place so I suggest a rezy...over size get's tight.Nice little wine shop named ""Paired"" with reasonable prices just down the street 2 blocks south from the restaurant which is great as HB is BYOB which is AWESOME and you didn't bring any wine.  For the dinner we had we hit $64 so very reasonable."
"I guess I went in here with my expectations way to high.  It was just mediocre for me.  It was nothing to write home about.  No special flavor like I was told I'd experience.  The ambiance is fabulous.  For the price, I would expect a lot more flavor for sure."
"After reading all of the Yelp reviews, my boyfriend and I were really looking forward to eating here.  I'd love to sugar coat it, but we were left fairly unimpressed with the meal.  The bacon-wrapped dates were the best dish of the night, but for the price, there were barely any in the bowl. I was excited for the escargot, because it seemed like a unique twist (served with tomatoes and mandarin oranges) on the original dish, but the final product lacked flavor, heat, and had very little actual escargot in it.  Three of the main entree dishes were sold out.  I went with the special, the pork scrapple, and my boyfriend went with the rainbow trout.  Once again, both dishes lacked flavor and were not served very warm. One very thoughtful gesture was that one of the cooks delivered us a taste of what was left of the sold-out gumbo, knowing that we had hoped to order it.  The flavor was good but over-salted, and again, not very warm! The service was good and the room is cute and quaint, but in the end, this restaurant seemed very overpriced for what was delivered. Perhaps, it was just an off night."
"This place looks and feels like you're inside a very rich person's living room.  The floors are hardwood, the walls are lined with carefully curated artwork, and there were goddamn chandeliers hanging from the ceiling.  It's a small restaurant with virtually no standing room, so be prepared to stand awkwardly in the middle of everybody's way while waiting for a table.Fried oysters, crispy pork belly, rainbow trout, the special of the night, which was a kind of duck pasta, and bread pudding.  Everything was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  The pork belly tasted like spun gold.  With a lot of foodie bullshit floating around, it's nice to eat at a restaurant that nails the basics and doesn't try to incorporate flavored air into every dish.Oh, and it's BYOB.  Get the fuck out of here, man"
"We were greeted super warmly and seated at the time of our reservation. Server David was just as warm as he uncorked and poured the bottle of wine that we brought.  He remained solidly attentive throughout dinner, and bussers kept our water glasses filled.Table bread came out right away; chunks of soft focaccia with balsamic.  We requested butter also, and this lightly herbed bread disappeared pretty fast.Artichoke & Edam Fritters - perfect temperature (not mouth scorching hot) smooth, melty cheese and artchoke pieces in a crispy crust, served with creamy aioli and a lemon wedge.  Texturally cheesy and delicious!  Rabbit & Spaetzle - chunks of white meat rabbit, with a large serving of fresh spaetzle, red onions, cremini mushrooms and red onions.  Yum!Bouilliabase - a gorgeous presentation of clams, mussels and shrimp in a lightly tomatoey broth.  Delicious!Smoked Hog Jowl - a grownup grilled cheese sammich with a crispy slice of pork, caramelized onions and slices of ripe tomato on chewy whole grain bread, served with skinny truffle fries.  The sweet onions and salty pork played against each other nicely, and the crunchy grilled bread exterior was really good.Berry Bread Pudding - freshly whipped cream-topped, almost candied-feeling berry studded bread pudding, moist and eggy and warm, with a layer of bruleed-feeling sugar on top.  Yummmm!The atmosphere was dimly lit and warm, somewhat on the loud side with the background music, with flickering tea lights on the tables.What a warm dinner experience!  I'd definitely come back - possibly to try the trout."
"Very quant.  The server was extremely helpful and nice. The recommendations were accurate, however in the last few days my wife and I had eaten at Avec and Ruxbin. Although they are very interesting, I've had enough truffle oil and aioli to last a lifetime.  Nice to BYOD."
"My husband and I ate at HB with friends and loved it!  It's BYOB, which is a plus in our minds, and the setting was warm and intimate.  They serve delicious, classic dishes with a unique spin."
"Solid unassuming neighborhood place. This place was cozy, warm, and cute. For me, it served perfectly for a lazy date with jeans and comfy shirt without losing the romance. The intimate decor and small space make you immediately want to get closer to your fellow diner. I also love the small-business, locally feel about this restaurant, makes me want to support them instead of spending my (eh or someone else's) money at fancier places. We stopped by one night for an early dinner. They just started services, and already there were 4 tables. For how small this place is, it was a good sign. Unaware that it was BYOB, I ran to a wine store near by and got a bottle of wine. Things worked out perfectly. We shared an apricot salad, pork belly, bacon stuffed dates, muscles and truffle fries, and something else on their special which I cannot remember. It was a fish dish. The salad was good, but on the small side. The pork belly had a good portion, but a bit too salty. It had some asian flavoring to it, and well executed - crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. He enjoyed it more than I did, since the salt kinda got to me in the end. Muscles and fries were good, but I've had better truffle fries somewhere else. If I have to rate the food alone, it's a 3.5/5. They only had 3 people working - a hostess, a server, and a busser. Server was really nice, but I felt like she was overworked. The busser was super efficient and quick, and our water was filled repeatedly. I don't have any complaints on the service, they did a great job considering how busy they were. So please, the next time you're looking for a dinner venue with great food and friendly service, either for a date night or casual dinner, check them out!"
"I won't launch into one of my lengthy, anecdotal reviews for this place since I'm only going to be repeating what others have already said, but HB is great.  I went with a group of 5 guys for a friend's birthday, and while we probably would have been more in our element at a more spacious, less intimate place, the food here is absolutely fantastic.  We didn't realize it was BYOB, so I volunteered to run down to Paired to grab a few bottles of wine, although one tends to underestimate the amount of alcoholic grape juice 5 20-something guys can drink, so I made another pit stop at 7-11 across the street.  Nothing pairs with the mussels like a Barefoot white blend, I'll tell you what.We ordered basically anything that looked good, including appetizers.  I think we had the aforementioned mussels, some type of fish (maybe salmon), beef cheek; we went H.A.M. although regrettably didn't have any ham.  I remember thinking everything, including the fries, which I usually skip altogether, didn't have much room for improvement, if any.  This is probably a 4.5 stars for me (and I round down), but a big kudos to them for taking care of 5 loud straight dudes when we probably should have been somewhere else.  I'll bring a date next time and take it easier on the Sav Blanc to compensate.Go here  Bring plenty of wine so you don't have to go to a 7-11 in the middle of the best dinner of your recent memory."
"Flashes of brilliance in a field of duds and a scene-stealing appearance by the salt monster.The good - great, actually, the corn off the cobb salad was excellent.  Great fresh flavors, textures, balance. highly recommended.   The BYOB approach is welcome. I'd like to see more of that on the left coast.The not so good - my sausage and clams over polenta could have been great - the housemade sausage was perfectly seasoned with just the right crumbly chewiness and the broth had a meaty richness. Sadly the clams were overcooked and the salt monster killed the entire dish.  Dud #2 was the smoked salmon gazpacho... the broth tasted like, well, watered vinegar.  The smoked salmon was good but drowned.  my wife's rabbit and spaetzle was embarrassing.  Looked like they didn't have enough rabbit on hand, and it was b-l-a-n-d. Must have been handled by someone other than the Salt Chef.Desserts were good, others have reviewed them better than I could.Friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff, but the busing was untrained... we had to protect what was on the table if we didn't want it to disappear prematurely - mr. speedy even got our Gourmet Grape wine bag from beside a chair, which we needed at the end of the meal.  And WHAT?  WHAT DID YOU SAY???  HUH???? yes, the room is very hard and noisy, in desperate need of some soft absorbent surfaces... somewhere.I was really looking forward to our visit to HB.  Sorry I can't recommend it."
"The food at HB Restaurant is fantastic - they focus on fresh and seasonal choices for their menu, and have a series of specials outside of the regular menu that change on a daily basis.Came here with a couple girlfriends for dinner before heading out for drinks - we were running late so I called ahead and let the restaurant know that we would be about 15 minutes after our initial reservation.  When we got to the restaurant, we were seated immediately, however service was pretty slow after we were seated.We started with the edam fritters which were tasty if not particularly spectacular.  I had the fried catfish with grits and okra for my entree - it had really good flavor, and the fish was moist and flaky.  My friends ordered the salmon with quinoa and the mussels - both were very well prepared (I sampled them both).For dessert we had this slab of dark chocolate candy with cayenne, green pumpkin seeds, and fleur de sel.  It was the perfect ending since we were all stuffed after our entrees.All in all, I would recommend HB Restaurant for a small dinner (or a romantic date) - the food is really good - just remember to bring a few bottles of wine with you to enjoy while waiting between courses."
"Had an amazing and memorable date night here. I didn't want to deal with a super trendy place, just wanted great food in a cozy and intimate atmosphere. If that's what you're looking for, HB has it. We brought a couple bottles of wine and settled in to our table. To begin, they served us chunks of bread with the most sensational balsamic I've ever had. So. Good. We started with the Belgian endive salad, which was definitely nontraditional, but very tasty. The sweetness of the pears balanced the goat cheese and hog jowl lardons very well. We also had the homemade Italian sausage and clams. Nom. The broth and Italian sausage were so flavorful, I literally did not want this dish to end. The boyfriend and I split the trout and the duck for our entrees. Neither of these are dishes we would typically order, but we trusted our waiter's opinion and were right to do so. Both were unreal, with so many elements and layers of flavor included in each dish. The proteins were cooked perfectly and the maple-orange-chilli pan sauce on the duck was really superb. We finished our dinner with the apple bread pudding that was on special, moist, not too sweet, perfect way to end the meal. Two notable pluses about HB are that you do not feel rushed to get through your meal and leave, and that the BYOB element makes it very affordable. Truly recommend this spot!"
"4.5 stars. Cute BYOB restaurant - exposed brick makes it feel very cozy.  The service was phenomenal. We ordered the special trout salad appetizer (excellent), bacon-wrapped dates (excellent), lamb burger (excellent), and special mussels/clams entree (good). The mussels/clams weren't our favorite but it was still well-prepared. We will be back to try the trout entree and order the delicious lamb burger again."
"Most dishes are superb! Except the spring chicken, cooking was done very well but it was way too salty. Mussels were amazing and good with truffle fries."
"I cannot say what a great time I had at HB last night. I went with my boyfriend for the first time on a date - we didn't make a reservation, but it was near 9:30PM and there was a table or two available. The space is small, quaint and intimate. A definite perk about HB is the fact that its BYOB. We stopped at Paired (a wine shop a block 1/2 south- GO THERE!!!) and grabbed a nice wine to share with dinner. Our waitress was fantastic. She was prompt, knowledgable and helpful -especially since it was my first visit. The food was amazing. I ordered the meatloaf sandwich with truffel fries (as gourmet as can be) and my boyfriend ordered the bratwurst with some sort of cole slaw salad. I let my boyfriend try my sandwich and he said, ""This is like having dessert first."" Definitely would recommend going for a nice date night. Not great for groups for more than four probably. It's awesome!!!!"
"HOLY SHIT BALLS!Every single dish was out of sight. The menu has changed now, I think, so things that were there now aren't, but I promise: this is a truly phenomenal dining experience. AND IT'S FUCKING BYOB THAT SHIT IS DANK!!!"
"The fish is really, really good. I also loved that I could run across the street to 7-11 and pick up a $10 bottle of wine. Hellllllllo, BYOB."
"I went to write an update to my original HB review and then realized I have never reviewed HB before. How that is even remotely possible is beyond me. I have eaten here at least 4-5 times a year for the last five years. Huge Yelp GNO nights where we got the whole place to ourselves, intimate date nights at a window table, small group dinners celebrating a birthday...lots of memories here for me. It is truly one of the best BYOB restaurants in Chicago, as well as one of the best restaurants in all of Lakeview.The reason I wanted to update is because I went there for the first time since Joncarl left for Philadelphia a few months ago. I am beyond happy to report that it is still the same friendly service and atmosphere, and the food is just as good as ever. Perhaps a little too much seafood on the current menu. It changes all the time but for some reason seems more fishy than usual. The bacon-wrapped dates are still there and this is all that matters!Small tiny gripe...if I almost gave a table a heart attack by dropping an extremely good bottle of wine on the floor while trying to open it and I knew it was an extremely good bottle of wine given as a birthday present, I would have comped the birthday girl a dessert. I'm not sayin', I'm just sayin'."
"This used to be my favorite restaurant in the city. (It is still good, read below.) This place was a flat out hidden gem. Go on Wednesday for the prix fixe menu (used to be $30, now it's $33). The place is BYOB with no corkage fee. The quality and preparation of food is great. The menu is cleverly assembled and has a good variety to please an assortment of tastes. Whoever designs the menu here is very passionate about food and has a great creative mind. I've had some of the best food of my life at this restaurant. A real foodie heaven. I've been to HB at least a dozen times and it's near and dear to my heart. I hadn't been to HB in a while and recently took four friends who had never been. While I'm not giving up on HB yet, I have to say I wasn't impressed with the new management. The food was still good, however the menu changed slightly, and the food lacked that incredible edge it used to have. Entrees were prepared well, but not perfectly, and certain dishes had too much sauce or were overcooked. Things like this just didn't happen at the former HB. Don't get me wrong, the food was still good, and for a $33 prix fixe, BYOB with no corkage fee, you certainly can't go wrong. You won't find a better value for fine dining anywhere in the city.One of the high points of this place used to be the service, but the last time I went, they were understaffed and the service was lacking. We were basically brought our food and left to our own devices. Not my ideal vision of service, but it was late (seated around 8:30) so I'll give HB a pass this time.Bottom line, this used to be one of the best restaurants in the city, bar none. You should absolutely go here, as it'll likely be a highly-memorable dining experience. I'm not going to let one mediocre experience deter me from returning. I'll be back to HB, and I hope they are able to return to their old form and deliver a breathtaking dining experience like the HB of old. I forgive you HB, but please maintain those standards that caused me to grow so fond of you over the past couple years."
Really love this cute little restaurant.  The chef is excellent and comes up with some pretty off-the-wall flavor combinations using some pretty high-end ingredients.  The Gnocchi with Lamb Sausage and Tempanade and the Smoke Chicken Thigh over Toasted Almond butter were both really delicious.  We also tried the salmon rillettes and pork belly apps.  They were delicious as well.  My only complaint is we had no room to try one of the fabulous sounding desserts.
"Tender mussels, frites and a $25 black grouper entree at HB pleasantly ended my detached, cold and rainy weekend.  It was the perfect evening to pop open my last bottle of precious 2007 Domaine Sainte Eugenie La Reserve Corbieres because it's a rare treat to dine with my big bro Mike and almost as rare for me to dine at HB.  I have ancient memories of when this white tablecloth bistro was once a bustling Boystown coffee shop with the same name, many moons ago.  It's all grown up and has a pricey menu to boot. Though the taste of my black grouper was definitely top shelf, I thought-bubbled what my friend eventually said out loud... ""that portion is a bit on the small side eh?""  He is a globe trekker that appreciated the tenderness of his braised beef cheek entree... and is probably biased because out of all the fine dining spots in the city, this is his favorite.  My grouper was drizzled with a pistachio pesto and had a bit of black licorice in the taste, I'd swear.  It's an odd combination but one I appreciated, even though I'm not a black licorice fan.  We asked the chef to pick a dessert and he raved about the bread pudding.  He was spot on because the treat was so delicate and fluffy that it toppled over as he gently set it on our table.  Chef was unhappy, but it really wasn't a big deal because we were just waiting to topple it with our spoons, anyway.  The menu suggest that it's a cinnamon almond bread pudding, but I was delightfully overwhelmed with fresh lemon zest and homemade whipping cream on top.Next time instead of showing up 10 minutes before the kitchen closes, we'll try to get there early enough to try the duck entree!"
"My boyfriend and I were in Chicago for the weekend and randomly managed to find this place on Halloween night. SO glad we did - this was one of the best meals I've had in a while. Love that it's BYOB as well - you don't find many of those in Boston! We went to the Whole Foods right down the street and found a great Oregon Pinot Noir to have with our dinner. We ended up going with the Eggplant Caponata to start, which had a smoky flavor which almost made it taste like meat. Amazing. I had the trout for the main, and I can't stop thinking about it. I could have that dish every week! The skin was perfectly crispy (would love to know how they got it like that!), and the horseradish sweet potatoes, braised cabbage, and fried egg were perfect accompaniments. I was so full by the end, but kept eating because it tasted so good. There were absolutely no faults with the dish. My boyfriend had the salmon, and it was equally as good, but I couldn't get over the trout. Incredible!!!"
"What's not to like about this place!? #1: It's BYOB! If you know of any better BYO place in the city please let me know. The glassware isn't awesome (small wine goblets), but -- hey -- they don't even charge a corkage fee!#2: The food is awesome. I've been in the fall, summer (post Cubbies) and winter, and the menu changes based on season and availability. The winter menu was a little heavier, but some recognizable staples (like the beer-steamed muscles) always seem to be available.#3: The food is reasonably priced and the portions are appropriate. Some of the pasta dishes skew a little large, but the meat, poultry, and seafood seem just right for a hungry guy.#4: The service is superb. The same head guy (beard) seems to always be there, and I even recognize some of the waitresses from multiple visits. The service is relaxed and professional. They don't rush you out - even though they sat us at 5:30 last weekend and told us they had another seating at 7pm, they shuffled some tables around to let us linger until we were done at 8pm (and didn't complain when we asked for refills on our coffees). #5: They take reservations. I'd suggest making them as the restaurant is small.#6: They have gum at the reception desk, which is key when you have the beer-garlic muscles and are headed straight out post-dinner.Would highly recommend."
"Such a highly rated place and less then a minute walk from place, what's not to like; basically everything.  Maybe I came on an off night, or maybe I need to come back for brunch but the dinner I had here was one of the worst meals I've ever had.  The space is a quirky little joint, I like the decor. However, they pack you in like sardines. I couldn't back my chair up without hitting a table, and every time servers walked by I got bumped.  Acoustics are horrible, its too damn loud to have a conversation.  Being a byob you'd think they'd have proper glassware but they don't. They seemed confused as to how to server beer.  Our server was inattentive, too many tables I venture to guess. Wait times between checks in, ordering and getting the check were way to long. There seemed to be a table of regulars next to us. We arrived at the same time. Their attention was off the charts, got food faster, got check faster, had double the ""how's it going""?  You can live with these things if the food is good, but alas it wasn't. I started with the fried chicken livers.  I almost gagged.  The balsamic sauce was disgusting and the texture of the livers literally had me spitting them out into my napkin.  This was the first liver dish ever I couldn't finish let alone eat a few bites. Our brain dead server didn't even ask why it wasn't eaten. My wife had a passable salad but forgettable.  The entrees were equally disappointing. I had a salty fish, yum.  I'm tempted to give a shot for brunch, but so annoyed it might be years before I give it a chance.  Skip this place and go to Wood for a similar place with much better food."
"My boyfriend took me here for an early Valentine's Day dinner and we had a great experience. I had no idea what to expect since it was a surprise, so when we walked in, I was very pleased with the atmosphere. This is a great place for a romantic dinner in the sense that it's intimate and cozy and you can actually hear what the person across from you is saying.We started with the almond stuffed dates that were wrapped in bacon with brown sugar. Delicious! My boyfriend felt they were a little too sweet, but I thought they were great. For our main course, we both had the rainbow trout, which came with fingerling potatoes, green sauce, celery root giardiniera, and soft boiled egg. Word of warning: the sauce does contain anchovies, so if you're not a fan, it might be a little overwhelming. I like anchovies, so the flavor didn't bother me. Also, the addition of the soft boiled egg was amazing. The chef recommended that we cut open the egg so that it would spill out over the fish for maximum flavor. We followed his suggestion and thought it was superb.We wrapped up our meal with dessert. I had a fig and apple crisp which came with fresh whipped cream. I thought it was great and not overly heavy. My boyfriend had the bread pudding, which was cranberry and butterscotch flavor (it changes regularly). He said it was good, but not great.Overall, I had a great meal here and I loved the ambiance. I would definitely like to come back."
Been going to HB for seven years. I would rather eat here than anywhere else in the world. My wife and I love this place.
"Still all-out fantastic. In fact, my latest experience really mirrored my inaugural brush with HB food ecstasy, which is obviously a very, very good thing.So, what did I learn? That HB can execute perfection, and repeatedly. Too often I have returned to a restaurant for my favorite dish only to be disappointed by 'second-time fail syndrome'. Have no fear diners, HB gets it done!The condensed 'what you need to know' aka 'what you should order': you will never go wrong with the edam artichoke fritters, bacon-wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and brown sugar, smoked eggplant crostini, pan-roasted trout, 'Amsterdam-style' mussels, any of their chicken dishes, and housemade Belgian chocolate and the bread pudding for dessert.Thanks for reading. Now go and conquer... er, devour!"
"This is a review for Valentine's day prefix menu.I'm really disappointed because when we made our reservations for Valentine's Day, we had no idea that it was the $130 prefix menu.  Not only did we have to spend more than we anticipated but we did not get to taste the tried-and-true menu.  When we made our reservations over the phone, no one disclosed the fact that the prefix menu would be the only available menu that night (nor that there was even a prefix menu at all). The best parts of the meal was the sweet potato soup and the anchovy pinxto.I had the fettuccine for my main course.  It tasted like vinegar.  There was no other aspect of the dish than a mouthful of vinegar.  I did not finish my plate.   The dessert served were 2 different chocolate ""bars"".  Very underwhelming, especially considering it was Valentine's Day.As for the service, the waiter, although nice, was not around very often. Not sure if I'll be back. A little bit turned off by this place especially because of the vinegar dish."
"I loved HB- have been wanting to try it for awhile and am glad we did. The atmosphere is ""homey' and warm, with exposed brick and low lighting. They play a lot of old rock songs in the background which were fun. We stayed for a few hours as it was a birthday dinner and were never asked to leave even though I think we may have stayed longer than they expected us to. Major plus that it's BYOB. My friend and i split the mussels and trout, both of which were excellent. The sauce for the truffle fries was amazing too. It's great they change their menu seasonally and I'd like to go back in the spring."
Prixe Fixe Menu is amazing on wednesday nights. Nice and cozy restaurant. Gotta try the bacon wrapped dates.
"Great date night.  Every single course we had was excellent. We started with the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with almonds and the escargot.  We wanted to order more, but we knew we had more coming.For dinner, the salmon was very light and healthy and had great flavors.  My husband ordered the special, which was like a rabbit pot pie.  It was very tasting - perfect for the season.  You HAVE to try the bread pudding for dessert.  It was sooo good.  I was so full and didn't even want to order dessert, but the second I tried a bite, I was so glad we did.  Amazing flavors.This place is perfect for a date night!  Great service, great food, great ambience!  The best is that it's BYOB so we could bring a wine we know we love and the bill was less than $100 for 2.  Perfect!Another tip: we had an a la card, which gave us $10 off (as long as we spent $25).  Will definitely return!13/365"
"OHMYLANTA!!!!!!!Or should i say OH MY AMSTERDAM!If you haven't checked out this restaurant, you seriously need to go now.While eating here, all my endorphins were kicking in at the highest capacity level.All the dishes we chose were absolutely fantastic!We ordered:Artichoke and Edam FrittersCrispy Durok Pork BellyArtichoke stuffed Dates""Amsterdam style"" musselsSmoked Chicken SausageBraised Lamb BreastI don't have words to describe how perfect each dish was. If I had to pick two items out of what we shared, I would pick Crispy Durok Pork Belly and Braised Lamb Breast. Those two dishes were cooked perfectly and flavored so beautifully.The Pork belly was just so crispy on the outside and inside the meat was tender with the turnip kimchee underneath - never thought those two flavors would go together but they blended together harmoniously - LOVE IT! The lamb was just so tender and fabulous.This restaurant is BYOB.Parking wasn't super difficult to find on a Saturday night surprisingly with the location in the heart of Boys Town and all.Reservations are a must because it is not a super huge restaurant.I highly recommend this restaurant, and I will probably try the rest of the menu next time! LOL"
"My pork belly left HB happily filled with pork belly.Savory bacon wrapped dates served as the perfect appetizer for my generous entree of brown sugar pork belly.  I wasn't too crazy about the veggies that were plated with it, but the grits complemented the protein well.I tried a couple of my friend's mussels, and those were okay, but the real winner of that dish was the pomme frites!  Dunked in that aioli, it was like crack!We couldn't resist the choices in dessert, and our table shared the rhubarb brown butter shortbread.  Delish.  Also BYOB.  The waitress did a good job of making sure our wine glasses stayed replenished.The only downfall of the evening was how hard it is to find parking in the area.  Teleportation cannot come soon enough."
"I took my sister's bachelorette party here for dinner.  Full disclosure: most restaurants HATE bachelorette parties, because it does truly suck to serve unruly drunk women who probably want to split the bill 15 different ways.  HB did not bat an eye at my constant changing of the number of women attending (even 4 hours before our reservations!) and served us so wonderfully all night long.Let me also rave about their food.  I was recently lamenting my newfound food-snobbery (CA produce is freakishly good year-round), and restaurants I used to love in Chicago are now just so-so.  NOT SO, HB!  We got 4 apps, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts served family-style for our group, all for $40 a person.  (I thought that was super-reasonable for the circumstance.)  Holy crap, everything was amazing and well-prepared.  The lamb sausage with mint-gnocchi was one of the most interesting takes on the English sunday roast I've ever had.  And it was delicious.  The salmon - amazing.  The veg red curry - spicy and authentic.  The smoked chicken that's then flattened and pan-fried? Oh my goodness - bring it on.  Cardamom panacotta made me very upset that I'm supposed to be going sugar-free, so I can't just gobble it all up.Flawless, amazing restaurant.  I cannot recommend it enough!"
"I have bumped them up from a 4 to a 5.  The experience my partner and I had yesterday was incredible, I arranged for Vday flowers to be delivered ahead of time and David was more then accommodating.  Apparently my partner had dropped off my gift ahead of time and David made sure that both items were on the table, and to me that's incredible customer service.Also, you MUST try the Ramen dish and the Mussels, both incredible dishes ---------------------------------I was really happy with them going the extra mile to accommodate my partner and I on a somewhat busy Tuesday, I went in at 7 and asked about a 7:45 reservation and he said they were booked until 9 but moved things around for an 8:15 seating, so that was very nice.They brought out little pieces of bread and only some balsamic, bread was dry and I don't really like balsamic, so that was an ehh moment, but that's me - not their fault.We had the bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates, they pretty much just threw 6 on a ramekin, no arrangement or garnish and the bacon was burnt and the dish was room temp.The fried clam strips were WAY to salty and the amount of cocktail sauce was a mere smear on the plate, which was not enough to mellow out the salt.If it wasn't for the main course being sooo amazing, their score would have been even worse."
Great fall off the bone duck and delicious bread pudding. The service was good and the atmosphere was warm and relaxing. Definitely a place to return to.
"Consistently one of my favorite places to dine in the neighborhood. Service has never been anything but both warm and  professional. Food offers refined comfort with memorable flavors. Of course, there's no getting around the obvious plus of being a BYOB. JonCarl has left HB in the most capable of hands."
"BYOB, check. Friendly & efficient service, check.Pleasant atmosphere, check. Scrumptious food, check. artichoke & edam fritters=5braised oxtail & ricotta gnocchi= 4not currently on the menu, but really hoping they'll bring back the BEST blt sammy of my life."
"3.5 stars really.I don't get what all the hype is about. Maybe I ordered the wrong things but the food was pretty mediocre, with the exception of the Special Duck breast they served that evening. Started with Artichoke and Edam Fritter which was ok - tasted kind of bland and the garlic aoli sauce was also rather bland. I had the Amsterdam Mussels with Truffle fries - good but not spectacular. The broth the mussels were in was delicious and the truffle fries were nice and crispy. But after a while I did get sick of eating just mussels. My dinner companion orders the duck breast which was ah-mazing. So tender, so flavorful, on a bed of couscous with some sort of rhubbarb jam. I wish I had ordered that instead!Overall, an OK experience for me. The duck breast really saved it for me. I would give this restaurant another try though - maybe I just don't really like Mussels as much as I thought I did."
"Yum. My bf brought me here on our third date. He had a reservation and we were seated almost immediately. We had almond stuffed dates to start, which were delicious, but then again it's hard to mess up baking dates wrapped in bacon unless you burn them or something. I ordered the braised pork shank, and the description said paetzle, jus, hen of the woods, and pickled peach salsa, so I asked the server what all of those things mean. She said she would just show me and she let me peek at someone else's plate that had just come out of the kitchen, but that didn't really explain anything. I figured I would just go with it, and it was delicious. The meat was just falling off the bone, although to this day I have no clue what paetzle, jus, and hen of the woods are. My bf got the Amsterdam Style Mussels, which were just alright, but this was my first time having truffle fries and I really liked them. Overall, it was a tasty meal and I had a great time. Service was good and the server was extremely friendly, like we need more happy people like that in the world. However, the space was small, and it was pretty loud so it was a little hard to hear each other."
"Love this place.  Will definitely return.  Added bonus - BYOB and no corkage fee!  The prices are really reasonable for Chicago and the portions are huge.We started with the artichoke and edam fritters; they were amazing!  They are quite heavy however so I probably wouldn't order them again.  But everyone should try them once.  Also had the dueling beet salad.  This might have been my favorite dish of the night (and the food was gooood).  Then we ordered the two entree specials of the eveing, a roasted guinea hen and a seafood stew.  As noted above the portions were huge.  Of the two, my favorite was the guinea hen.  It was so full of flavor and had so many layers to it.  Delicious.Funny story, and I am sure this won't happen to anyone else.  After we were served our entrees, the woman next to us got our attention and said, ""I know this is going to seem really inappropriate and weird but could  just have a taste of your meals, they look amazing"".  We obliged and in return she let us taste their almond stuffed dates.  The dates were really delicious and I would seriously consider them ordering them the next time.  And we will be back, I guarantee it!"
"Delicious! I've been twice now and loved every appetizer, entree and dessert. Some of the items I've had are the pork belly, liver parfait, caesar salad, mussels, and salmon.   This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  If you haven't been, please check it out.  Everything has a well-balanced flavor and exceeded my expectations. I haven't had a bad dish there and I don't think I ever will.  Thank you HB for the wonderful food and service!"
"I came here as a shot in the dark 2 years ago and I am SO GLAD I did!  This little gem is my favorite place to go in Lake-view, BY FAR.  I have not been let down in the 4 times I have been here.  Its amazing and BYOB (conveniently 711 is across the street if you run out).  Definitely try one of the specials they offer that night!  The menu is always changing but ALWAYS delicious, fresh and creative.  If you get the chance to try the crispy pork belly, escargot, home made fried mozzarella, ricotta gnocchi and or the seared duck with mandarin orange and chili glaze....DO IT.  Pork shank with German potato salad is amazing as well."
"I went with a group for my birthday last year, and this review is long overdue. This place was great!  The food was spectacular and something a little different. Service and ambiance was fun and not too stuffy. It was a huge plus that it is Byob! I kind of forgot about this place and can't believe I haven't been back since my last visit... What a gem!"
"Luuuuuucy, I'm Hoooooooome bistro.  I have a confession to make.  I judge people by their favorite foods and restaurants.  I also judge people I don't know by their yelp reviews q=), but that is another story. If the place sucks, I am their new enemy.  If the place is awesome, I am their soul mate and may ask them to marry me.  I came to Home Bistro restaurant on the glowing recommendation by Jennifer M.  I warned her of my caveat, yet she pressed me onwards.  HB Restaurant is BYOB, so pick up a wine and they'll uncork it free of charge.  The restaurant is kind of small and parking along the street is limited so RSVP and come early if you can.I believe Home Bistro's menu is seasonal as Jennifer M's duck wings and beef cheeks were nowhere to be found.  Undeterred, my party started off with the Charred Corn Salad.  I don't think I've seen a more vivid looking salad.  The sorghum vinaigrette paired nicely with the arugula, corn, carrots, and walnuts.   Then everything came out at once and there wasn't an empty spot on the table.  The sweet Housemade Pierogi was out of this world.  Foie gras, Benedictine, stuffed together with the plum jam has me drooling at my work desk.  Normally, the thought of a snail slithering down my throat grosses me out but the FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out) always gets the best of me.  Surprisingly, I enjoyed Sautéed Garlic & Escargot.  It almost makes me forget the slime, beady eyes, and him wanting to hide in his shell.  What do you have to hide?!For our main courses we had the BBQ Beef Tongue with truffle fries.  The truffle fries instantaneously disappeared because they were magnificent.  The luscious Braised Pork Shank falls apart at a simple jab of your fork.  The only disappointment of the night was the Brisket special.  N one does brisket like Texas forever.  We ended the night with scrumptious Strawberry Bread Pudding.  Great service and great food, HB restaurant is my homeboy."
"Overall a fab experience!Reservations highly recommended especially during the weekends. Our waitress was super friendly and gave me the name of the sauce that I told her tasted like 'sriracha meets heaven'. Even though me and my husband are vegetarians, she patiently briefed us our options and said that she'll be able to throw in a couple of sides from other entrees aside from the one veggie option they feature. We started of with artichoke and edam fritters with aioli (5 stars), the wheat berry salad with roasted beets and smoked onion vinaigrette (5 stars) and the fregola dish (again 5 stars!). We got a side of quinoa tabouleh with raita and squash spaetzle that made me too full to try dessert. The co-owner is into photography and so beautiful black and white pictures of Lake Michigan clicked by him decorate the walls. Loved our experience and will be back when they have more veggie options."
"I came here a few years ago, but it was such a good meal that I remember everything about it.Things to get:Black mussels - These are the most uniquely spiced mussels I have ever had. The sauce was deliciously prepared in this amazing beer broth with star anise and basil in it. The dish came with truffle fries. Who doesn't like truffle fries?Almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon - It's sweet, it's savory, it's crunchy and nutty. There are simply so many flavors and textures packed into these little delicious morsels. I could seriously eat like an entire bowl of these.Milk poached sturgeon (10 stars*) - Now this could very well be my last meal on earth. The fish was amazing and man, the creamed corn went so well with it. And the salsa verde too! I don't even like salsa verde!Braised pork shank - The pork had great flavor and did not leave me feeling heavy. Meat so tender, I forgot to use the knife. It was that good."
Do you despise long reviews? Say yes.This is one of the best restaurants in the U.S. that I've been to. Done.
"HB Home Bistro is small, but don't let the size of the place fool you because the food is great. I went a while back and don't really recall what I had for dinner, but I know it was delicious. I never would have guessed that HB would be this good - but it is. Make your reservations far in advance and enjoy one of the best spots in Lakeview.Will be back."
"Having not been here for a while, we decided to go for the prix fixe. I was a little skeptical since i read jon carl left a couple months ago, but was open to going still. Every time ive been there its been great. esp with byob. the service is always great too. atmosphere and vibe are pretty homey and relaxed.we tried some new things. instead of going the normal fitters or oysters route, we chose the liver mouse and pork belly. pork belly was yummy. and i liked the texture and tastes of the liver mouse and mustard seeds and pita chips. then we followed with the endive salad. i thought it was perfect. people who arent keen to mayo on stuff might not like it though.then i went for the seafood stew while he got the lamb. i thought the stew was okay. i usually get the mussels though and kinda wished i did. he said lamb was alright. the meat itself was good but with the creamy minty sauce under it, i am not sure he enjoyed it that much with the meat.then we had the pudding dessert. omg. yes.overall it was slightly underwhelming. the amount of food though is always huge. i suggest for someone who has never been, go starving. like you havent had a bite of food all day if youre opting for the prix fixe on wed. also, dont eat the bread as you will def not make it to the end. its almost a challenge any time i go there because i wanna make it to the dessert part and i can almost bow out by the time entree arrives."
"So HB, you and I both already know how much I absolutely adore you.  But last night, that love was taken even a step further.  I went with 2 friends for the Wednesday night Prix fixe.  We were silly to think 1 bottle of wine would be enough for the 3 of us after a stressful day at work.  We'd pretty much finished off the bottle after the first course.  Lo and behold, the chef comes out to chat it up with some customers, notices our empty bottle and volunteers to run across the street for us and pick up another bottle!!!! IF THAT'S NOT GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, I don't know what is!!!!!!!!! That's absolutely realizing your customers needs, and going 10 steps beyond what's regularly expected.  HB-you've once again proven why you're my favorite restaurant.  also p.s. the whole fish-FABULOUS!!!! Love any restaurant that's willing to serve whole fish WITH the head!"
"After seeing all the Raving reviews on YELP, I decided to come here for my birthday dinner.  First of all, this place dont have a big menu, or big variety of food... They had maybe 5-6 appetizers and maybe 9-12 Entrees. The whole menu is just one page. So, anyways, I tried ordering the mussels but they said they dont have it anymore, run out or something. Then i said, Okay, lemme try the Trout that the server has been telling me about, she went back into the kitchen, came out then said We also run out. So I said .... Well, Okay-whatever the special of the night, the Vegetarian dish you mentioned- I'll try that, and to my Horror, she came out along with the manager and said they also dont have it, Sold out. Whatt????????And, at that point, my birthday dinner at this place was a failure. We were all extremely disappointed. Why would you not have the food you put on your menu? Not just one but three of the only 9 entrees you put on your small menu???????? I did settle for the vegan curry, but naah, it just really did not taste good..I dont think  I will ever come here. Really did not impress me one bit.."
"I just had one of the best meals of this year here.  We had a far inferior meal at a big Michelin star place recently for far more money.  The whole staff is kind and genuine, and the people are clearly passionate about the food.  It blows my mind that this place doesn't have wider recognition, or a line out the door.It's hard to find fine dining that's BYOB, especially as a vegetarian.  They had proper glassware, decanted a bottle for me, and the food was truly spectacular.We will be back soon, and I have gone out of my way to tell my foodie pals about this hidden gem."
I went here last night with a few friends. The setting was warm and inviting as was the staff. They started us off right away with bread and we had a pate going around as well that was very good. We also had a cesare salad with the sauce having a strong anchovy kick to it. I had the brisket for the entree and was also able to taste one of their lamb sausages. The brisket was excellent and very tender. The lamb sausage was delicious and was a bit spicy. We then had an assortment of bread puddings and brownies for dessert. I had some of a brownie that was awesomeIt was a real great time and I will certainly go back again
"Joncarl and his partner treated us like queens for our GNO at HB last night. Never was a glass empty and all of our bellies were full. The food was divine and it never stopped! Plates and plates of food just kept coming out of the kitchen and we were delighted with both menu items and special creations.Some of my favorites were the artichoke and edam fritters with garlic aioli and the almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon and baked with brown sugar. Joncarl also made this bread that was unbelievable! It was crisp on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. It had been drizzled in truffle oil and then topped with garlic, rosemary and parmesan. I die! Joncarl even whipped up our favorite dessert - blood orange mousse! It was good enough to make a restaurant full of loud and animated girls go hush. You could have heard a pin drop. HB really is a cute little restaurant. As I was looking around I thought to myself that this would be a great space for an intimate little party. And, of course, Joncarl and his team offer exceptional hospitality."
"Awesome food plus BYO!!! Reasonably priced gourmet menu that changes daily. Super fresh, super good plus they'll refrigerate the booze you bring in. Service was top notch. Dress code is smart casual. Ambiance is relaxing it's small, homey and intimate. I'll be back for sure."
"All I asked while sitting there as the beef cheeks melted on my tongue was was.. WHY ME? Why did I live in Chicago for 4 years and never tried this until I visited the great city again a year later?!This is my new favorite restaurant in Chicago. I was skeptical at first, as I usually am for places with lots of reviews and high stars. Don't wanna jump the band wagon. But it definitely lived up to it's 4.5 stars. Environment is very home-y (hence the name ha) - white linen cloths and simple interior, kind of like grandma's house minus the cheesiness. Classy grandma perhaps?Now onto the important stuff..Very unique menu with a variety of choices. And very unique dishes / meats. We tried:Mussels - swimming in a sweet broth, perfect for dipping the complimentary bread, so don't throw it away!Duck wings - yes. I know - they were even more amazing than they sound!Beef cheeks - as stated earlier.. melts in your mouth. Amazingly tender, juicy, and fatty! Just how I like 'em ;)They didn't disappoint me at all. Maybe I just ordered the right things, but I left very, very satisfied and impressed. Also BYOB or wine."
Super pretentious. Really over the top. But then again you know going in. I actually like it but my husband couldn't understand why they didn't have one standard meal that is just tasty without any over the top fancy sides. I guess I need to find friends to go with me instead. I will say also the front staff is very nice but the cook is a total jerk. He walks around the neighborhood wearing his apron cutting people off in line and is just overall mean to people. dude if you are going to be a jerk at least don't advertise for  your restaurant in the process. Debated between two and three stars by the way.
"Salient feature here is NOISE!!! Hard surfaces abound, not for a relaxing evening. We went on prix fixe night, $33 for 3 courses. The lamb sweetbreads were over fried, sadly, I love juicy sweetbreads and these were not. My chicago friend had the bacon dates, very good, not amazing. House cured salmon gazpacho was forgetable.corn off the cob salad was wonderful, sweet corn tangy and hot with lime and chili, and mellowed with parmesan, highlight of the night! Rabbit and spaetzle featured indistinguishable slivers of rabbit tossed with bland spaetzle. I was so disappointed. This could have been a great dish, it wasn't. The italian sausage, peppers and clams was nearly inedible because of oversalting. We tried all 3 desserts, the bread pudding by far the best, stick with it. Maybe it was an off night, i wouldn't recommend hb based on our experience."
"WOW to add insult to injury, the owner reach out to me, said it's my fault for the terrible service because we apparently did not give them enough time (group was in the restaurant for over 2 hours) and when asked not to contact me again due to insulting tone of the conversation told me ""I wish you the best of luck in your life.  The way you are going about it is clearly not working for you"" - Direct quote from his email! Insulting a customer for having a bad experience at your restaurant? WOW just WOW"
"This BYOB reminds me of the hole-in-the-wall restaurants in Philly--the kind you stumble upon and feel ridiculously lucky for finding. It's really cozy, homey, and everything on the menu is amazing.Notes:-Start with the bacon wrapped dates. Always.-All the appetizers are delicious, and have pretty much tried them all. The oysters, however, are exceptional.-Can't go wrong with the rabbit and spaetzle.-Their bread pudding dessert is really tasty if you can make it to the dessert portion of the meal. Highly, highly recommend.-Parking is not easy to find, so build in some time.-Make reservations, you will most likely be in for a long wait if you don't. Sundays are the possible exception."
"4 and a half stars!!Took my man for his birthday dinner here. Its a lovely little place - quaint and cozy. Loved the photographs adorning the walls and also the quotes :) It is a BYOB place - which is a huge plus. We got a good bottle of wine with us for the dinner. They serve complimentary bread with balsamic. They should sell the balsamic stuff in a bottle - I would totally buy it!!  We started with the assorted olives and the Artichoke and Edam fritters - OMG, I was in food heaven when I tasted the fritters. They were super delish - a fantastic start to the dinner. For the main course my hubby ordered the vegetarian dish which was the Fregola and I ordered the mussels in the beer broth with anise and they came with truffle fries. The mussels were delicious!!!  It is their signature dish and they do not disappoint - they were probably the best mussels I have ever eaten. The fregola was also very delicious and flavorful.The reason I take away half a star is because of the lack of vegetarian choices. I appreciate the vegetarian entree that they have (it is delicious), but they should consider adding maybe 1 more vegetarian entree."
"Went here on a recent date night with the future hubby and it was lovely. BYOB is great, but its hard to match such a diverse menu!Our food was very good. Not blow you away, I'll be back as soon as I can afford it good but very good. Considering it was only a week ago and I can't remember a single dish we had specifically, nothing really stood out. Thankfully they have their menu online to refresh my memory.Almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. I didn't get the fuss over these. Has no one else tried stuffed dates before? Because these are exactly the same as everywhere else you've ever had a stuffed date. Are they good? Yes. Are they yelp worthy? I don't think so.We had a special salad with a horseradish dressing and trout that was SOCLOSE to being incredible but just lacked a little bit. It was like they toned it down for the older clientele instead of fully unleashing the flavors. The smoked trout was a wonderful compliment to the dressing though.I had the mussels and they were, well, mussels. I've had better and I've had worse but the truffle fries were quite good. The special rabbit cassoulet my partner had was like a very rich rabbit pot pie without the crust. It was a perfect winter dish - filling, rich, warm and decadent. I think it was the highlight of the meal, even if it was a bit one-note.As others have mentioned, the service is great. I wasn't as big of a fan of the dining room as it is very small. The chairs are also fairly uncomfortable which was a detraction for me from the meal. And finally, they don't have any way to block the wind so every time someone enters or exits the restaurant expect a blast of cold air. All in all, I won't be rushing back because I look for something more unique in a restaurant meal."
"HB rocks! It sure does. We had such a great experience from just calling to make the reservation, John returned my call almost immediately and we were set for a Sunday night party of 4 at 6pm. By 7pm, the place was already packed which tells you something about a place. The place has a very romantic ambiance, very quaint, small and intimate, perfect for a date night or a gathering with another couple. Our server was there immediately, he was super friendly and attentive. He opened up our wine right away which is a major plus about this place, byob and you are set! He recommended the appetizer special which was deviled eggs with smoked trout, which was amazing, it was savory with a sweet element to it, and a sweet onion crunch on top, bunch of amazing flavors rolled into one, and I'm not even the biggest fan of deviled eggs, but these were truly special. Add them to your menu HB! Next we had the bacon wrapped dates which honestly weren't my favorite. They were good, but definitely better at places like Mercat a la planxa. I felt like the bacon was a tad on the fatty side instead of crispy, and I felt like instead of putting them in brown sugar, they should just be lightly sprinkled. For our main course we had the mussels and the fries with a garlicy mayo alioli sauce. Ooooh sooo yummy, they made up for the dates. They were better than the ones I had in Brussels which is known for mussels, (and the portion you get is enough for two people) and the fries I may have liked even more, super crispy, flavored perfectly and that mayo goodness. Okay, so how could we pass on dessert since everyone talks about their vanilla bread pudding and the one they had that night was an apricot preserve on top with cream, OH MY G. I was never a fan of bread pudding until I had HB's it was gooey, not overly wet, perfect texture and flavors. Definitely a MUST get! So overall, we had a fantastic experience with great service, even better food and a fun double date! The only issue is parking in this area, so come a little earlier unless you're one of the lucky ones who can walk to this place from your casa."
"We made reservations here before we caught a show at the steppenwolf theater. BYOB (we brought a bottle of reisling, and they'll put it on ice for you), a humungous bowl of mussels cooked in beer broth along with truffle fries, and bread pudding for dessert. Can't get any better than that! I highly recommend it if you're in the neighborhood! Yum Yum!"
def unique.and very romantic and intimate atmosphere. i've tried beef tongue sandwiches here a while ago. i personally enjoyed trying something new. beef tongue sandwich is not something you see on the menu everyday. TRUFFLE FRIES are fab.
"I'm tinkering between 3 and 4 stars. HB Restaurant wasn't bad by any stretch, but it wasn't amazing. I'd equate it to going to eat at a friend's house whose mom was a pretty good cook. Notice I said ""pretty good."" Maybe my expectations were too high?It's small and loud, which is fine with me. Adam R. and I were immediately seated for our 8 pm reservation on Wednesday, with plans to indulge in their $30 prix fixe menu. I loved the menu, by the way. It's diverse and eclectic. We started with the veal sweetbreads and escargot. The sweetbreads were pretty good, but super salty... salty exterior, and super salty hummus. The escargot were prepared in a stew-like sauce with lots of crushed tomatoes and garlic. I'd never had them this way, and I liked them... comforting, home-y. For my entree, I had the hog jowl. I'm sorry, I really wish that the menu described it as a ""sandwich"" because that's what it is: an elevated BLT. It came on two slices of whatever bread, with more tomato than meat. The meat itself tasted and looked like bacon. I don't know, I was not expecting it at all. It tasted pretty good, but not mind-blowing by any means. Adam R.'s chicken thighs were a much better choice. They were savory and sweet (just like him! ...) and he really enjoyed them. My dish came with truffle fries which were probably the highlight of the meal. Perfectly crispy and delicious.For dessert, he ordered bread pudding (with some sort of berries in it, I can't remember) and I had the candy bar. Both were good, but not great."
"Let me start by saying that I rarely write bad reviews on yelp.  Even when I have a negative experience at a business, I prefer to write positive reviews for good experiences instead.  I've been to HB at least two dozen times and have always enjoyed the food, service, and ambience.  I've brought friends, dates, and family members and have recommended this place to many people.I brought my boyfriend there for the first time last Tuesday, June 12th.  It was his birthday.  He is a classically trained chef who has worked all over the world.  I have worked in the restaurant and bar industry for over 20 years, myself.  We will never return to HB again.We started with the charred asparagus and the fried oysters.  The charred asparagus was served cold, which was fine, we just expected the dish to be served hot due to the verbage on the menu.  The dressing on the asparagus was far too garlicky which made fininshing the appetizer impossible.  The fried oysters were good, but the grits they were served over were full of hard lumps.  We didn't complain about either dish, because it just isn't our style.  I was trying to save face as I had raved about the restaurant to my boyfriend for weeks before taking him there.On to the main course:  My boyfriend ordered the rabbit leg confit with spatzle and two kinds of peas (two?)  The rabbit leg didn't really seemed to be confit and was shredded throughout the dish.  We assumed it would be whole.  It was very dry and rather tasteless and the spatzle was quite rubbery.  He managed to choke about half of it down.I ordered the lamb belly and eggs with spring onion kim chee.  My lamb belly was so salty and tough, I couldn't stomach more than one bite.  The kim chee was also inedibly salty.  What a waste of spring onions!  The deep fried poached egg was delcious, however.  When the owner or manager (not sure which) noticed I wasn't eating my entree, he came over to see what the problem was.  I politely explained that the dish was just too salty for me.  He picked up the plate and rudely informed me, ""Five other people ordered this dish tonight and no one else had a problem with it.""  ARE YOU KIDDING ME???  That comment alone changed a bad experience to a never coming back again experience.  I've honestly never been more insulted in a restaurant, especially by the guy running it.Like I wrote earlier, my boyfriend and I aren't the type to complain or get upset at a restaurant, so we simply paid the check and left.  I don't know if there's a new chef here, or if it was his day off, or what exactly was going on that night but insulting a guest is completely inexcusible.  Perhpas he was drinking another table's bottle of wine in the back.  Regardless, you lost a valuable customer that night HB."
"Our company had our holiday dinner here last night and it could not have gone better.  A huge reason was the service and food provided by HB.  There were twelve of us and we were served family style.  We had about 8 courses, which was wonderful as we enjoyed trying a good portion of the menu.  The pork shank was terrific.  As were the desserts.  Especially the panna cotta."
"I came here last night with a few friends and we had a great time. I love that it is BYOB. It makes this place a delicious and economical option. We had the artichoke fritters and sweetbread appetizer to start. I had the chicken thighs with hazelnut butter, brussel sprout slaw, and peach and jalapeno. It was so delicious and the skin on the chicken was so nice and crispy. My friends had the hog jowl sandwich, the mussels, and the veggie option and everyone loved their food. Everything was delicious and the service was very friendly. We realized at one point that we were the last diners, but the servers were so gracious and didn't rush us out. We had a wonderful time and we will be back!"
"Went to HB with some girlfriends to celebrate a birthday, and the experience absolutely lived up to our expectations! Food is fantastic- interesting flavors offer a twist to traditional home style cooking. Byob feature makes the restaurant affordable and comfortable. Service was wonderful. Highly recommend for any special occasion, or for a yummy cozy meal on any week night. Highly recommend the linguini special if it's offered."
"My gush-fest continues!I headed back to HB for a birthday dinner for one of my nearest and dearest friends last night.  Chef Joncarl and his entire staff made us feel like absolute rockstar royalty.  The food?  Amazing.  The service?  Incredible.  The little touches (customized menus, shout-out on the daily special chalkboard outside, decorated table) made the night so special for everyone.I love you, HB!"
"Definitely my new favorite restaurant. Wonderful atmosphere and service. The food is phenomenal!! We had the walnut endive salad and the Moroccan chicken stew. Everything was just amazing, I can't wait to go back and try everything on the menu!"
"The Home Bistro is a true neighborhood gem and my favorite restaurant in the neighborhood. I have enjoyed the HB on four to five occasions now and had amazing food and overall experience on each occasion. The HB has the total package; nice ambiance, excellent servers and staff, a creative, expansive and most important tasty menu and generous portions to boot. What is nice is they are BYOB as well, so you can enjoy a gourmet meal with a very reasonable tab. There is a wine store conveniently located nearby in case you forget to bring your own. They also feature a great Prix Fie on Wednesdays where pretty much the entire menu is fair game (only a couple of the most expensive dishes incur a nominal upcharge) and sometimes have fun events such as an Easter Brunch (that was outstanding). In addition to providing customers with top quality cuisine, they treat their customers well. I highly recommend the HB to anybody who appreciates good food. It has a menu that will satisfy both a foodie as well as someone with more traditional meat and potatoes type taste. For those in Lakeview it should be on your shortlist of top restaurants and for those from other parts of Chicagoland it is worth a trip to Lakeview just to try out HB. The HB is a wonderful choice to celebrate a special occasion, to entertain out of town guests, to impress a date or to just have a nice meal out. Two thumbs up, way up!"
"You know when one of those times come along where you go to a sort of under the radar kind of place based off the fact that the menu looks pretty darn good and then BAM, you just discover one of your all-time most delicious meals ever?This was it.BYOB is a big plus here.  Allows for you to try many amazing dishes but keep your total bill in a range that most people can afford.They are putting out some INSANELY tasty food.  Nothing too cutting edge, or crazy plating techniques, just unbeliveably good food.What I had:The fried oysters.  My god.  The fried oysters.  Get these.  Then get them again.  Then maybe again for dessert.Sweetbreads.Artichoke/Edam Fritters - amazingGnocchi - best I have ever hadThe only semi weak spot was the dessert.  Good, not great, and not a lot to choose from.Great restaurant."
"From the ambiance, byob, service, and amazing food- this place was fantastic!  We will definitely be back! Try the pork belly app- you won't be sorry..."
Rabbit and spaetzle is on the menu. Delicious. I had to remind myself to eat this slowly so I could savor every bite. By no means does that imply that this was a lean portion- it was just right.One of the specials was Pork Tenderloin with a currywurst sauce on potato salad. RIch and (also) delicious. My g/f got it  with the promise we'd trade if the curry was too overpowering. She shared but never said it was overwhelming to her taste buds.Friends with us had the same and also got the truffle fries. Very good and definitely NOT oversalted.
"HB has inventive, high quality and perfectly-prepared dishes in an cozy, sweet environment.  out waitress was enjoyable but a bit under-attentive.  the food took quite some time to come out, which is perfectly fine for perfectly cooked dishes.  however, while i didn't taste anything throughout my prix-fixe meal (wednesdays, $30 for a 3 course meal from the entire menu.. yes you heard that right, the entire menu) that was NOT good (or even very good, for that matter), i didn't try anything in which i felt like i was dying because it was so good.  i was expecting that from my friend's rave reviews, but i will definitely be coming back to try more and search for that euphoria.. it is BYOB which makes for a very cheap date for a realllly wonderful and FILLING meal.  don't even consider coming here on wednesdays without a reservation, however, and reserve some days in advance for the best times."
"HB Restaurant is great, I started a dinner club for some friends to tour Chicago with me based on the best food reviews.  HB was our first stop.  They have a $30 prix fixe menu that we enjoyed on a Wed.  It's BYOB, and there is a great little wine shop down the street that I was able to stop and buy a great bottle from.  They only allow a max of six guests per party on prix fixe nights, which was a bummer, but turned to be perfect. The staff was very friendly and patient, as we were all running late, the food was amazing and the atmosphere is really nice.  I highly recommend coming to HB Restaurant.  I cannot wait to come back."
"Love, love, LOVE this place!Friendly service, great atmosphere, BYOB and the $30 prefixed menu (Wednesdays) is one of the best deals in the city. I went with a large group so it took longer than normal between courses, but everything we had was delicious. A few of the standouts:-Artichoke & Edam fritters-House smoked pork jowl-Sautéed little neck clams-Coriander crusted salmon-Pork specialCouldn't be happier!"
"So, granted, it's been a little while since me and me (ex) boyfriend ran into this little joint back in 2009. But I wrote down everything we ate, which helps me remember.I basically agree with a lot of the other reviews about the following:A.) The food they serve here is SEASONAL. That means lots of vegetables, as well as local meats, and a lot of balsamic, vinegar-y flavors. Don't come here expecting Paula Deen's cooking, a food coma, or a distended stomach. But your tongue will be tingling with the happy zest of whatever you ate. We came there to eat in the fall (September) and had olives and focaccia bread, champagne-braised leeks with palenta, and oven-roasted beet salad. It honestly was all delicious and flavorful. Even though the portions weren't that big, I found that the food was flavorful enough (and I was having a swell enough time) that I could savor it and make it last quite a while. I remember the hot beet salad, and it was very filling and warming to the body. B.) The SERVICE is the selling point for me. I read a few reviews that said they received sub-par service from the older, male server... which may unfortunately true. But thankfully, we had this lovely 30-ish lady server who, honest to God, was so excited to tell us about everything on the menu. She was extremely friendly and welcoming, and I agree with another reviewer who said ""it felt like you were eating at a friend's house"" and their mom just happened to be a pretty good cook. Also, the owners, who popped in and out as we ate, seemed very sweet and attached to their business. I think they're a couple. Many reviews complained of the noise; the room does echo quite a bit, but I guess it just depends what night you come in. C.) The DESSERTS ROCK. Heck, I'd say it'd be okay to come here JUST for dessert if you really wanted to. We had the bread pudding, which there is several pictures of on here. Deeeelicious. If I could suggest an improvement, it would be to make the serving sizes bigger for the desserts. I know these guys are probably trying to be ""health-conscious"" and to get you to savor your food, but sometimes I just want a giant plate of something fatty and sugary and delicious. Lastly, I agree with the reviewer who said this is one of those ""holes in the wall"" that you feel ""ridiculously lucky"" to find. I definitely felt ridiculous lucky that night."
"Horrible attitude and service. I used to love this place. In fact I think we were one of his best customers. We used to hold wine tastings there on a regular basis. They are no longer accepting reservations for groups who order off the menu. In other words...they do not want business. They don't return calls. There is a dramatic change in attitude, service.  I doubt Jon Carl is still the owner."
"I wanted so badly to love this place but unfortunately, it didn't merit a 4 or 5 in my opinion.Service - was efficient yet courteous. We were seated on-time for our reservation and water/bread etc. were promptly served. Ambiance - cozy yet sophisticated. Cost - fair, for the portionsFood - Loved my appetizer (clams) and dessert (bread pudding). Was so disappointed with my pork dish (no flavor at all, although the meat was tender) and my partner was also rated the skate wing as 'ok'.I'd love to give this place another try. Maybe I will."
Mussel is amazing. Trout is amazing and Penna what what (a desert) is beyond human realm.
"Cozy and unpretentious BYOB spot with excellent food! Chef Victor always has great items on the menu whether you are going for their brunch or dinner service. My friends and I brought in a few bottles of champagne and had mimosas over some great brunch items. The french toast is amazing, but truthfully, you can't go wrong with anything on the menu! The almond stuffed dates for dinner are also high recommended and their specials are always really well thought out."
"I'm going to go with a 5 on this one based solely on the food. The space was set up awkwardly, felt a bit cramped with uncomfortable chairs and tables that are too small, and was too dimly lit even for my taste. The candle on our table went out three times and had to be replaced and re-lit, which was kind of annoying. I would like to see what I'm eating and not have our dinner interrupted three times. Service was professional, not overly friendly, but just right. The food was the star of this show. Artichoke and edam fritters for starters, unique and tasty. My dining companion had the braised beef short rib which I had a taste of and I wish I had ordered because it was the best short rib I've ever tasted. It was so tender it just came apart, you could eat it with a fork. I had a white fish of some kind (I don't remember and since they have a seasonal menu, I couldn't look it up online) served over hummus with a cucumber salad. It was perfectly cooked and flavorful and the hummus was a nice twist. I honestly don't remember what we had for dessert (I get fuzzy after a bottle of wine), but I remember not being all that impressed by it, might have been a bad pick on our part because they were out of their other desserts.  A meal here can be quite affordable since it's BYOB. Don't even think about showing up without a reservation because this place is really small and there are only a few tables and people tend to linger. The space, ambiance, and service were all ok, but what really matters is the food and HB delivered big time in that department."
"HB is fantastic because- the service is exceptional- the menu items are creative, unusual, and tasty- the ambiance & decor is tasteful and inviting- its a BYOLet me elaborate on the service, the staff was happy, kind, and attentive. Our waiter was the owner of the restaurant. He smiled the entire time and enthusiastically offered recommendations and advice on what to order. We were at our table for quite awhile but no one ever tried to rush us. I also happened to forget my credit card. When I stopped back to get it, the card was safely locked away in a safe AND our waiter stepped outside to recommend various bars in the area to try. The service is what earned HB 5 stars.Now, of course, the food is good too! We shared a swordfish special with green beans and couscous served in a sort of teriyaki sauce that was delicious. We ordered the artichoke fritters, but they were just okay for me. They are very rich.  We also tried the fried soft shell crab, veggie burger, and beef sausage. Highlights- the crab comes on a bed of melon, mint, and ricotta cheese that was delicious! The veggie burger came with the most fabulous French fries and tomato jam= awesome. Lastly, the entire beef sausage entree was excellent- imagine a marriage between a Polish sausage and a hamburger. That is the dish I would absolutely order again.HB provided a wonderful Friday evening dinning experience."
"The definition of blah. We went here due to the good reviews-- not only was the service terribly slow, but the food was mediocre at best. We had the anchovies and olives for an appetizer-- the anchovies were clearly canned. I had the salmon-- blah doesn't even begin to describe the flavorless boredom. It wasn't terrible-- but it was not good. You are clearly paying for the location and there are better places."
"Forgetting the fact that I need to tell you about the food, location, decor, blah blah blah... the thing that sticks out most to me is the service. When we arrived for the multi-course family-style meal (they knew I needed some meat on my bones; not really, but let's go with it), I set my Guinness™ cooler backpack on the back of my chair. A co-worker had introduced me to the underworld of icing and I was in too deep to get out now. Our waitress bumped into my bag a few times and asked if she could move it. I pleaded with her not to do so, so that I would not get iced.""What the hell is 'iced?',"" she asked.I told her. She laughed and exclaimed, ""Boys!"" exasperatedly and went about her business. In the mean time, she poured glass after glass of wine, replaced plates of artichoke cheese fritters with truffle fries, eggplant/roasted red pepper/feta incredibleness succulent seafood, perfectly prepared fish, crisp veggies, mouth-watering chicken, and some of the best desserts I have had in a while (chocolate + sesame seeds = [redacted]). By the end of the meal, my icing victim had left his bag unattended -- as had I. Noting that there was an icing to be had, the waitress notified me that my buddy's bag was sitting in the chair.""Oh yeah. Danny must have forgotten his bag. I should get it to him.""""Don't you want to stick one of those things in there?""Blank stare.""Those nasty vodka things in your backpack.""""OH! Yeah! Right!!""""Well, you better hurry up. He's coming back.""Sensing sabotage to be afoot, she DELAYED my buddy so that I could place a WARM raspberry Ice in his bag. He came back into the dining room, saw his sad fate and my glee was paramount. Thankfully, in Chicago, you can get a pretty good meal in more than a few places. But how many stellar meals come with a girl-Friday co-conspirator? I think I love that waitress."
"The food was delicious and unusual, and the wait staff was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. I would definitely go back."
Fish was unreal crispy and delicious and you should get after it
"Great service and a great menu, but the food was not as drool-worthy as I would have expected. The pork jowl appetizer was a bit underwhelming. The lamb sweetbreads were nice and tender but quite salty. My rabbit and spaetzle was lukewarm and missed that BAM in taste that I was hoping for. The one thing that I really loved was the cheese plate though."
"If it were possible to hand out ten stars HB would get all ten in a heartbeat.This is pretty much the perfect place for everything - a first date, an anniversary date, an outing with friends - you name it.  The coziness of the restaurant welcomes all people, as does the food.  You can tell when people truly care about they are making and this applies to HB.  For appetizers we got almond stuffed dates, wrapped in bacon.  If that doesn't make you drool check your pulse.  The escargot was perfect too - very tasty.For dinner I went with the short rib, which was excellent.  My girlfriend had the bouillabaisse - wow.  One of the better entrees we've ever had in a restaurant, anywhere.If you came here to decide whether or not to go to HB, the answer is yes, go."
"HB was a dining experience that made my night. The food was definitely good, but the service made it stand out. The minute we walked in, our server couldn't have been any friendlier- he was the owner! We could tell he absolutely loved his job. We started with wine and also brought champagne. When we were running low on wine, without asking he popped the champagne cork for us- awesome! On our way out he also gave us bar reccos.Food-Swordfish appetizer- good, but wasn't a stand outSoft-shell crab- the feta, melon and mint was my fav part of the dish- who knew that would work well together! Veggie burger- good, very hearty. The tomato jam and truffle fries were my fav part of this dish. The tomato jam was the most unique thing we received  there.Beef sausage- amazing. I'm not a big red meat eater, but this was my favorite dish. It tasted like a Swedish meatball almost. Can't beat the price- went with 2 others, left stuffed and spent around $30."
"Boys town has more than just chiseled abs; it's got HB. The debaucherous nature of bars boasting booty short clad men is far removed from HB's interior. It's a place crafted specifically to engage its diners and fosters an appreciation for real conversation.The food is definitely the epitome of a last meal request that would make any dying man/woman leave this fine earth with a smile on his/her face. Artichoke fritters. Bacon-wrapped dates. Divine salad. An entire fish. Succulent chicken. Desserts straight from heaven. Yes, now you can truly go rest in peace.It's BYOB, and no, that doesn't stand for Bring Your Own Boy."
"Loved this place!   Went there with 3 other people and it felt like we had most of the menu.  I am surprised we got to the food from the amount of yummy bread with the balsamic that we ate, but we still managed to get 4 apps, 4 mains and 2 desserts.  It was my birthday and even though it was on a Thursday, we dug out some great wine, so I don't remember the latter part of the evening as much :)Highlights: My boar bolognese.  Even though it wasn't recommended by the waitress, I order this every time I see it on the menu in any restaurant.  Its a memory that I have from Tuscany - having this amazing dish and then seeing wild boars cross the road on the way home...  This wasn't Tuscany, but probably the best I've had in Chicago!  Another highlight - sweetbreads app and beefcheek main course.  Surprise was the Caesar + almond stuffed dates in bacon - we were happy that it was such a generous portion, otherwise some fights could have broken out...Midlights: there were no low lights :)  Escargot preparation wasn't our favorite, but of course we still mopped it up with the yummy bread.  Overall - fantastic and a definite recommendation!"
"BYO and B and the 4 greatest letters in the English alphabet and this place has em all locked down. If you're all about saving moolah when stepping up to the plate of a nice meal out, put this spot on your to do list. I came with a gang of Yelp CM's with a for a team building dinner and ended up having a flavor party in my mouth with a guest list of chicken and shitake mushrooms, mussels, bacon wrapped dates, and a whole bunch of other delicious plates. I don't remember what else I sampled besides what I just mentioned, but they were all stellar. The rest of the meal was a blur of BYOB covos with some of my Yelp besties. The service was very friendly and I'd give them a 5 star regardless of our waitress conspiring with one of my coworkers to ""ice"" me outside the restaurant. I don't suspect you'd need to bring a Smirnoff in as a blocker if you're an average customer, but if you feel the need for that security it is BYOB. To summarize I'd say that it's pretty fitting that it's in the Boystown neighborhood of Chicago, cuz I'm a  little gay for HB."
Service and atmosphere were excellent - and it is BYOB. Can't beat that.I have to say that I didn't really care for what I ordered - but that's because I ordered the soft shell crab special and didn't realize how hard soft shell crab is to eat! My mistake for ordering. The other options looked delicious - and I definitely would be happy to make my way back for some more (though for a somewhat special occasion because the prices aren't cheap).
"I pity the fool who happens to find himself trying to enjoy his dinner at the same restaurant as the group I dined with on Wednesday. We take up a ton of space, demand a disproportionate amount of attention from the waitstaff and generally make a scene, usually a consequence of drinking far too much wine with our meals. So when we first stepped into HB last night for a work dinner, I gazed around with guilt in my heart. This boisterous bunch was bound to tear this cozy, homey little romantic bistro to shreds with our high-maintenance ways. The place had a delicate decor, dim lighting and precious details like antique mirrors that reminded me of a French chateau (if I knew what one of those looked like). But I have to say HB handled us with supreme grace despite their unassuming looks. First good move: their family style menu. Rather than turning us loose on their eclectic choices, we had a set menu of some of their mouth-watering selections. My personal favorites included their artichoke and cheese fritters, which were like huge fluffy planets of tastiness. I also of course loved their bacon wrapped dates, which were smothered in brown sugar. The second smart move: BYOB. I know this wasn't invented just for us, but when we have plenty of our own cheap wine and champagne, we're sold. Some of us even managed to get some icing in between courses!To top off a magical eating experience, the service was impeccable. The waitress felt like an old friend by the end of the meal, even asking our advice on her accessory choices and suggesting strategic ways to ice one another. Cheers to HB for rolling with our punches and coming up on top. Float like a butterfly, sting like HB!"
"What an amazing restaurant.While planning our trip to Chicago, my boyfriend and I decided that we'd do dinner one night at a nicer restaurant (you know, one that needs reservations). So we scoured Yelp, checked out a bunch of menus, and decided upon this place for our Sunday night dinner. We were definitely not disappointed!The first thing we were served was bread with a balsamic mixture. Pretty standard, right? Well, something about the balsamic here just blew us away. I don't know what it was, but that stuff was like crack. For our appetizer, we had the veal sweetbreads. I have wanted to try sweetbreads for quite awhile, so this was a big time treat for me. They were perfectly spiced, perfectly cooked, and absolutely delicious. We had a hard time deciding on entrees with all the tasty sounding options, but we finally went with the beef cheek and the pork shank. They were so good, and I can't even tell you which one was better. The pork shank was so tender that you didn't need a knife, served with mushrooms, pickled onions, and a white bean puree that were all super complimentary. The beef cheek was served with a Henry Bain sauce. I'd never heard of it before, but it tasted kind of fruity, yet a bit spicy (in a horseradish kind of way) and it just complimented the rich flavor of the beef perfectly. It's all about the subtleties here with the flavors. Just perfection, really. For dessert we got a half order of the house made chocolate bar, and it was just beautiful. I think it might have brought a tear to my eye. Ok, maybe not, but you get the idea.Service was leisurely, but that's what you'd expect here. You don't want to be rushed, and the servers were very professional and extremely knowledgeable.  It had a great unpretentious, homey, atmosphere and we felt quite comfortable there. And for what you get, the price can't be beat.Just go. Do it."
"i had HB on my ""to do"" list for at least two years now & finally went for my birthday, only to be sorely disappointed. the meal went something like this (party of two on a thursday night):- waitress ignored us for the first 10 minutes- raved-about almond stuffed dates were... mediocre. small. barely warm. ""meh, i've experienced better"" is right- i ordered the lamb meatballs. taste was good, but dish was lukewarm to cold; waitress did not check on us for at least 15 minutes after we had received meal- asked to have the meatballs warmed up. waitress does not ask why i asked to heat it up; does not apologize at any point in the meal; does not even ask how we are doing or if we like our food- mussels & fries were good- the waitress & bus boy fight over the thermostat the entire meal. one would turn it up. 30 seconds later the other would turn it down. this went back & forth at least 15 times. we were seated next to a vent, which kept blowing cold drafts on us every time someone changed the thermostatfood tasted good, but the cold dish, awkward experience & bad service has moved HB to my ""miss this"" list."
"First, the service is excellent.  When I called they reminded me it was BYOB, and when we arrived the chef went over the specials.  The waitress was great too.  Only complaint, unisex bathroom.  Always locked.Escargot is a great app, we also got the pork which I didn't love. I had the rabbit for my meal, it was out of this world. It'd be difficult not to order that again.  GF had the white fish, which was a special.  Her's was amazing as well.Had the butter cake for dessert, pretty tasty."
"Royalty. That's how I felt at last night's dinner at HB.Colleen C, Queen of Yelp Midwest, chose to take our group of sixteen to HB for a family style dining experience.  And while I usually do research on the restaurants I eat at, I didn't get a chance to even catch a glimpse of a yelp review for HB prior to walking in the door... good thing I trust Colleen!So, I walked into this charming restaurant with no expectations at all.  First I noticed the character of the building's interior: a brick wall on one side, mirrors and art on another, and the little bathroom near the kitchen with the sign on it that reads ""library.""  Attentive and friendly service came next and continued throughout the night... and since HB is BYOB, we brought plenty to keep us buzzed and happy for hours!It looks like Abby, Christina, and Mariah already touched on the many courses of gourmet cuisine that we feasted on. The portion sizes were large (just how we like them); the flavors were sensational; and we all left 100% satisfied.  Being queen (or king) for a day (or dinner) is fun! I'd definitely return to HB with friends, family, Yelp community managers, or on a date with my husband... this is the kind of dining experience you should share with those you care about."
"What a great place!We did not have a reservation but the hostess/server went above and beyond to block us into a table.  Great service the whole way from start to finish!And then came the food.  Even Better.  The young or inexperienced may look upon the menu with doubt as the pairing are not your traditional combinations but the Chef, David Cooper and his staff know what to do... you are in great hands!BYOB! Super Terrific Great Job!"
"I checked out HB for the second time last night, and enjoyed another solid meal (though not as great as last year when I would have rated HB 5 stars).  The service continues to be top-notch.  The host (who is also gentleman who takes reservations) and waitress were both very attentive and friendly.  Most impressive was that my two friends and I were so busy chatting that we didn't even realize that the restaurant had cleared out, and they were ready to close yet no one hurried us out.  Really, this was so thoughtful and the main reason I am rating HB 4 stars instead of 3.So, unfortunately, this meal wasn't as outstanding as last time, and I'm wondering if it was the dishes we ordered.  The bacon-wrapped dates were delicious (though I don't know if this dish has ever been bad anywhere that I've been).  We also shared the sweetbreads appetizer which was very tasty.  For entrees, I ordered a special, the pork belly, while one friend ordered another special, lamb with dates, and the other ordered the gnocci with oxtail.  We all tried each others dishes and agreed that the pork belly, hands down, was the best.  The gnocci with oxtail was nice though nothing special, and the gnocci perhaps a bit too big/doughy.  The lamb was a huge dish; however, my friend felt it was heavy on the dates with not much lamb.  The waitress did tell us that she was the last order for the evening, which made us question whether her portion was the leftovers.  For dessert, we split the chocolate bark, which was nothing special.  So, in summary, our dishes were hit or miss.  Last time I was here, all of our dishes were spot-on.  If you order correctly - perhaps selecting the dishes that repeatedly get great reviews on Yelp - you can leave this cozy BYOB with a 5 star experience!"
"One of my top 5 favorite restaurants in Chicago. It competes with the best! Worth the drive up north, the staff is more than friendly, knowledgeable and personable. It's BYOB and reservation only for your info. Their menu changes based on what's in season but I've never had anything that was not delicious. Their aged cheese dish for an appetizer is outstanding and all their seafood dishes are outstanding. Trust me just go if you haven't been already!"
"I love HB for it's ambiance and reliably good food.  It is the kind of place that you can be sure whatever you order will come out delicious and satisfying.  The atmosphere is cozy for a romantic date, though it would also be great for a small group of friends.  A must try."
"Ah, HB it's been a while, but I am still a huge fan of the wonderful things that come out of your kitchen. I want to see the man behind the curtain! What's going on back there? Whatever it is, I like so keep it up.BUT, and this is a big one, you really need to work on that whole size thing (in terms of the size of the place of course). but they say size isn't everything. who are we kidding? it is indeed. Just a smidge or two larger and we'll be best friends again.Menu items worth mentioning:Smoked Gouda tasting appetizer (nice portion size)truffle fries (tasty but don't dare trying reheating them)smoked chicken sandwich (outstanding)other noteables:Staff did a great job of managing our small group and other tables throughout the dining room, give or take a few hiccups and waiting games, OH and they are still BYOB and will keep your beverages chilled."
"Amazing, creative, innovative food. Our house-made duck prosciutto with fava beans, blue cheese and red onions was out of this world. I had a fantastic smoked pheasant thigh dish with brussels spouts salad. Huge portions, fantastic food, intimate setting with wonderful service. Cannot wait to go back to this warm and welcoming restaurant.The host is the husband of the chef/owner and they really treat everyone who comes in like a special guest in their own home."
"We ate here last night (Thursday), we made a reservation for 7pm a week in advance.  It seemed like that it was unnecessary it really didn't get full until about 8:30, it is a fairly small spot (occupancy max 50).  They started us off with some small focaccia slices to be dipped in balsamic, which we thought were a bit bland.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates (per the fellow Yelpers rec'd) and really liked them, they are a little different than Cafe BaBa Reeba's because they are stuffed with an almond and brown sugar (no cheese).  For dinner we split the Sausage (special for the night) and the  Oxtail Gnocchi, both were cooked perfectly.  The gnocchi was some of the best I've had, comparable to some we've had from Cafe Spiaggia.All in all it was a a great experience, cozy atmosphere, great BYOB policy and good service, we would definitely go back, also finding parking on the street wasn't too difficult either."
"BYOB, delicious and creative food, nice big portions, friendly wait staff. HB, you revved my engine. This is a must-go restaurant in Chicago.The mussels are out of this world good. I had actually never ordered ""Amsterdam Style"" Mussels (just a big-ass bowl of mussels) at a restaurant before but after seeing the huge bowls of steaming shellfish flying out of the kitchen I decided to take the plunge. Just delicious (and fun to eat!). Even if you are not a fan of mussels, go here and order em'. I don't know what they put in that broth and frankly I don't want to know. The deliciousness scares me.The rabbit and spaetzle dish that my girlfriend ordered was amazing as well. Super tender meat, perfectly cooked spaetzle. We rotated dishes multiple times during dinner, it was hard to pick a winner.The bacon-wrapped dates were delicious, though on par with bacon wrapped dates I have had at tapas places like Cafe Babareeba. IMPORTANT NOTE: Our server didn't blink an eye when we brought in scotch and vodka to drink with dinner. We were in a cocktail mood and usually you get the poo-poo when you bring the booze to a fine dining establishment. Not here. Cool. The ratio of delicious food eaten versus money spent at HB is amazing, you gotta try this place."
"F'ing amazing. All I can say.Soft crab as an appetizer. Coriander rubbed Salmon with cannolini beans, watercress, pistachio and charred tomatoes for the entree. Bread pudding for dessert.Great food and extra individual attention. Not only do they ask if everything is going well they kindly fill up your wine glass with each pass.A relatively small dining area (make reservations) creates a one of a kind experience. The menu is short and sweet but dives deep into the palate and BYOB helps defray the final cost of a nice evening out.Great place for a fine dining experience, a date, or perhaps a belated birthday dinner. Either way you won't be let down."
"I love family style dining. There's a difference between family style dining and splitting tapas, too!First of all, the portions are larger. Not much larger but there's something to be said for splitting a large plate of food with a table full of people  vs. sharing a small bite. Second, there's something to be said for the presentation of family style dishes. When they brought out the giant fish (complete with head and tail), I was totally impressed! It's not often I see that offered at a restaurant...Finally, it's the company that makes family style dining so fun. When you work alone 350 days out of the year, being able to see your co-workers face-to-face over a delicious meal is pretty exciting! Passing the plate while catching up on wedding plans or new pets feels good. It's as close to ""coming home"" that we get as Community Managers.I don't mind stuffing my fast as fast as possible when working alone during the day/evening, but it is a distince pleasure to be able to share a meal (quite literally) with my fellow co-workers and friends."
"Came to Home Bistro for my b-day dinner, and couldn't have been more pleased. I didn't even mind weathering a severe state food comatose for hours afterwards!It really should be noted that the service at HB is spectacular. From the moment we walked in, the host was attentive, seated us right away, hung my coat up, and put our beers in the fridge (OBLIGATORY BYOB REFERENCE HERE).The bread and balsamic vinegar that comes out with the water is decent, but kind of seems like an afterthought once you take a look at the ever-changing menu. For an app, we had the artichoke and edam fritter, which was served on some thick, delicious roasted garlic aioli (MMMmmm.... aioli). Definitely split this one with someone--the flavors are great, but I couldn't eat more than two without totally spoiling my dindin!For the main course, I ordered the pasta special. I honestly can't remember half the ingredients that were in that dish, but the noodles were super-wide, and there was veal in the sauce, which was seasoned with..... CINNAMON. You can't go wrong with cinnamon-seasoned red meat in my mind. With some porcini mushrooms and other veggies mixed in, topped off with perfectly fresh and creamy goat cheese, this dish was one of the richest, more complex meals that I've eaten. So good!We were too stuffed to order dessert, but the host brought us out some powerful little dark chocolate-covered bourbon balls that were just the right size as to ensure that my stomach wouldn't rupture, but satisfied my sweet tooth.A great dining experience in a warm, cozy atmosphere. If only the service at every restaurant were as good as HB!!"
Great place. Love the atmosphere and music. The service is good and prompt. Food was delicious but definitely unique. Wouldn't recommend to those who wouldn't eat outside the box. But definitely to the adventurous people. It's byob so that's a plus in my book.
"Oh man. So good. I've wanted to go here for a bit but my gf would probably only like the vegetarian burger, so thankfully they brought back brunch for Easter. BYOB mimosas (didn't charge for oj) and $8-$12 meals. Killer prices. Artichoke fritters. Yes. Get them. Soft crispy chewy awesomeness. I had some salmon manna (spelling) dish which I'm struggling to remember. I remember liking it. Thinking about the fritters has me distracted. The deep fried French toast was delectable. The sweet apple bacon omelette was bomb."
"Once last spring and now again in the dead of winter I have been blissfully enveloped in the cozy blanket of HB.  The food is wonderful (details momentarily), but somehow the service and setting manage to steal the spotlight.  The employees here are full of big smiles, warm enthusiasm, infectious goodwill, and an uncanny penchant for reading minds.  Best restaurant staff in the city in recent memory.  The room is snug and quaint and homey (if a bit clamorous) and creates the perfect mood to enjoy the meal.The first time, I started with the much-recommended artichoke and edam fritters, and have to confess myself disappointed.  I felt that the overwhelming flavor was ""fried,"" drowning out any edam or artichoke.  Thankfully, after that, everything was excellent.  The mussels were wonderfully aromatic (mostly basil) and while I feel that this dish is pretty easy to get right, these were some of the best mussels/broth that I have encountered.  The truffle fries were a bit salty, but tasted great dipped in the mussels broth.My entree was the pork loin, which was excellent--the best pork loin that I can remember ever eating.  I rarely find this piece of meat cooked right, but this was done perfectly--a bit of a crust on the outside and still tender and juicy inside.  And not at all fatty.  With a bit of scallopped potatoes, cabbage, and a few cute slices of sauteed apples, it was a great, great dish.After the spring visit, I looked forward to returning in the winter, because it seemed like a place that would excel at the kind of food which most pleases during the cold months.  And I was so, so right.We started with a brandade which was slightly saltier and fishier than I was expecting, but still worked very well.  I had a bite of my friend's entree, a simple but very satisfying Greek-style lamb pie.  But the real star was my entree, which had piqued my interest on the specials board outside--beer-braised wild boar.  Cooked with tomatoes, root  vegetables, and pepper, dusted with parmesan cheese, and served atop some thick square egg noodles (think big raviolis without any filling), this was the PERFECT winter dish.  It's over a week later now and I can still taste it in my mind...and I want more!  It was so amazing.  All the ingredients worked brilliantly together, and the noodles provided a very nice balance for the strong flavors.  Seriously, I try to avoid hyperbole in these reviews, so please believe me when I tell you that this is one of the ten or so best savory dishes I can ever remember eating in my entire life.Dessert was pleasant but an utter anticlimax after that:  in fact I can't even remember what it was called.  It was a pie in which the ""filling"" was like a really dense chocolate-chip cookie.  I really wanted some milk with it!If you haven't had the pleasure, get thee to HB.  Take a bottle of wine or a few beers and let them take wonderful care of you and set amazing food in front of you."
"I wish there were 1/2 stars!!!  I'd give this place 3.5, but I'm in the mood to round down today.We had a later reservation on a Saturday night and due to the nightmare of parking in boystown, some of the party was running later than expected.  I wish valet would've been an option.The table shared the artichoke & edam fritters - oh my them things were tasty!!, Coopers Pate - good flavor, but a different texture than I'm used to and the Cheese tasting - how can you go wrong with cheese anytime??  I then split the Farro salad with a friend.  Everything in the salad sounded scrumptious - dried cranberries, spiced walnuts, mustard greens, curry vinaigrette - but sadly it was dry and left me wanting more.  Guess we should've gotten the dueling beets or caesar salad.  For entree I shared the braised oxtail and ricotta gnocchi - the flavors were of the spot on and the oxtail was perfectly cooked, but the gnocchi was a bit on the doughy side.Overall I'd give HB another shot.  It's a tiny restaurant so I recommend reservations, but on a good note, it's BYOB.  The best part - our waitress was hilarious and a joy."
"Two words :Prix-Fixe Wednesdays!   I write this review on my couch while completely food drunk from the amazing meal my husband and I just had for his birthday.  We both ordered the prix-fixe options.  His starter was the artichoke & edam fritters and mine was the deviled shrimp.  I sat there savoring the deliciousness and stared as he looked like he was having a heart attack in his mouth.  Our main dishes were the veal and the rainbow trout.  We were both again in complete awe as the proteins melted in our mouths like hot butter.  Succulent. We finished off with the blackberry bread pudding and lemon pound cake.  The pudding was steaming when it came to the table, so sweet and waiting to be devoured.   We were both so full that the cake sits in our refrigerator waiting until tomorrow.  The coffee which accompanied was welcomed and necessary.This was a meal that will not be forgotten.  We have been here before and will return again.  Oh, and did I mention it is BYOB?!?"
"I live about a block from this place, so it's pretty shameful that I had never been there until last night. This place is small, but in a good way. It creates a cozy ambience. Everyone working there is patient and attentive. I went to hang up my coat and when I got back, my wine bottle was open and a glass already poured. Now that's what I'm talking about! We went for the $30 prix fixe. My appetizer was the smoked salmon and potato salad. I couldn't envision what this dish was going to look like, but it was very pretty. And it tasted better than it looked. Also tried a bit of the artichoke and edam fritters...I've never had a fritter. I like their fritters. It was a good way to start off my life as a fritter eater. My main course was cornmeal crusted catfish, with dirty rice on the side. Oh this poor dish, it didn't stand a chance. Delish. This is the time to add that I hate bland food, and everything they served was seasoned just right. Sha-zam.I can't recall what I had for dessert exactly. But there was pecans, chocolate, and whipped cream involved. Sugary bliss. Fair warning to those who dine late, as the night goes on, HB gets more and more crowded. This place is BYOB, so grab some friends, grab some bottles, and enjoy!"
"I would give this restaurant no stars if I could. So overpriced and overrated. Everything was just bad about this place. The food was slow coming out even though there were only two tables with two customers each. I've never tasted such a schizophrenic dish in my life; it's like the chef couldn't decide what it should taste like, so he decided to combine everything under the sun that just didn't marry well and competed with each other. The cherry tomatoes were cold with a slightly sweet vinegar dressing; the polenta was cheesy; the clams were overly salty; the fried kale was also overly salty with a ton of pimenton. Even if I could get past the assault on my taste buds, the amount of food was pitiful, particularly for $25. My sister and I had to go elsewhere to fill up after this meal. We also had to ask for some bread. They produced four little pieces, which came out steaming hot from the microwave. That was their attempt at disguising stale bread, which was of course, made extremely chewy when cooled after being nuked. Then the two servers/greeters were too busy talking to each other to notice that we were done eating and would like the bill to get the heck out of the joint. The bottom line is, don't waste your money and time at Home Bistro."
"I absolutely loved my dinner here! First, it's great that it's BYOB without a corkage fee. We started off with the date appetizer and a side of truffle fries. The dates were interesting, tasty, and has a great mix of textures and flavors. The fries tasted fresh and rich without being too greasy, and I loved the mayo it came with. For dinner, I got the brisket. It was incredible! So tender that I could twirl it around my fork like noodles. It was so tasty! The dessert was also incredible: cherry bread pudding! Yum, awesome! Service was great as well. I will definitely be back!"
"I LOVE this place--everything about it was charming and delicious! I went on a whim with my aunt on a rainy, Sunday night. Sadly we didn't know it was BYOB, but I will definitely be back with my OB. :) The food here is phenomenal! I had a special which was a goat dish served with lentils and some spicy middle eastern sauce. SOOOO good!! My aunt had a home made sausage dish which was also really tasty. The service here is also really great; our waiter was extremely attentive, knowledgeable and very friendly! Cute atmosphere and fun people-watching!It's a wee bit pricey, but worth it! Great place for a date or a quiet girls' night."
"Small and tight area but cozy with dim .. if anything candle light lighting. The host, Bob was extremely warm and welcoming. The menu offered escartgo, fried oysters, smoked chicken liver, veal sweet bread.. and this is just for starters!Dueling Beet salad is awesome.now for the dinner selection.. choose from braised oxtail and ricotta gnocchi, lamb shoulder burgoo, ""amsterdam style"" mussels, rainbow trout... the list keeps going.I went on Wednesday - and took advantage of the you pick three dinner for $30!"
"I was here almost two months ago, and the meal is still ingrained into my memory!We had a reservation, so the wait wasn't bad. The staff was extremely friendly, and the co-owner even stopped by to make friendly banter throughout our meal. I had the pork knuckle pappardelle, and it was delicious. It was a little over-salted, but ended up pairing really well with a nice BYOB wine. The portion seemed a little small at first, but I was able to try out the seafood and mussels from my friends, and they seemed like the better dishes to order. I really liked the atmosphere that they've created here, including the artwork and restroom decor. I'll definitely be back soon to see how the restaurant is doing."
"Geez HB, take it easy. You're not supposed to do EVERYTHING right...For real, not for fake, they tear it up. When you call, you'll usually get their voicemail. They're really good about calling you back promptly to get a reservation. It's a small place, with some interesting wallpaper and a mixture of artwork on the walls. They have very nice enough lighting that it's not too intimate but not so bright that you can clearly see what's going on everywhere. Their menu is consistently changing. There's always something that will surprise you, intrigue you, and deeply satisfy you. The prices of their food is baffling, plus its BYOB. For a similar experience you may break $150 for two, you can get away with less than $65-$75 for two. HB Restaurant has a refined ""ma n' pa"" type of feel to it. They put a lot of thought into their food and execute it just as well. The service, ambiance, and overall experience is an A+. BRAVO HB! BRAVO!"
"I am a food snob. So I might come across as very harsh. But so was the food. I am surprised at why this place gets such high reviews across the board. May be because it gets high footfall and it is in the middle of everything. Everything we had was bland, too mealy, spiceless.  The lamb sweatbread was only lamb fat and no lamb. Artichoke fritters had no artichoke but flour. Pork belly was too thick and way too salty. The accompanied squash was inedible - coz it was sprinkled wth salt after being doused in soy sauce. The hanger steak was ok but by that time we were about to walk out. The gnochhi was ok. Bread pudding was warm but came with warm cream n not ice cream. Ugh In all, I would not recommend at all."
"LOVE. I'll make it short. BYOB.Hilarious, nice staff.Artichoke & edam fritters. People-watching on Halsted. ok, ALL their food/desserts.Fab atmosphere, good music."
"Saturday night EARLY dinner - only had 5p availability - was bummed but had read great things so why notAll true - setting, service plusOwner and staff warm, engaging and attentiveFood was very good - from an appetizer of  artichoke fritters to our mains of catfish and lamb shoulder BYOB helps to make it work tooWill definitely go again"
"Came here with two friends on my recent trip to Chicago this summer!Food was so good, but also really unique and interesting.   We got the fried oysters with grits, which was probably my favorite part of the meal.  It was crispy, delicate and extremely tasty. My boyfriend had the grilled octopus and wasn't crazy about it (but I think that this in part because he's spoiled by Astoria greek food). I loved my oxtail gnocchi.  The desserts also were outrageously good. The menu is always changing though, but it seems that HB focuses on integrating fresh ingredients. Definitely worth a visit!Oh, and BYOB!"
"So so so so GOOD! HB is just so wonderful and delicious! The service was phenomenal, and the food was just wonderful. Literally one of my favorites in Chicago! It is BYOB, so even though it is a little pricier, it's still very inexpensive all things considered. If you have not been you must go! It's the best in Boystown!"
"Without a doubt, the best mussels I have ever eaten were at HB - I actually dreamed about them for three days after dining in the restaurant, they were that good. Not only were the mussels cooked to absolute perfection, but the beer broth was absolutely divine.But HB didn't earn five stars on mussels alone - the entire experience was wonderful. My date started with the veal sweetbread, which he finished in about five minutes, while I had the cheese tasting. All three Goudas were excellent choices. And the truffle fries that accompanied my mussels were delicious.The waitstaff was very polite and pleasant, and the atmosphere was quiet and cozy. And of course, HB is BYOB, which is very appreciated. It's equally perfect for date night or an evening out with the girls. I can't wait to return - I might even go out on a limb and say that HB could be a contender for my favorite restaurant in Chicago. It deserves every one of those five stars.Be sure to make a reservation though - HB can get booked pretty quickly!"
This place is adorable. Super cute/romantic atmosphere and DELICIOUS food! I'd consider it a little pricey for your average night dinner but not TOO extravagant especially since it's BYOB. Went here with a few girl friends the first time and although it's more of  a romantic kind of setting it was nice. Came back with my boyfriend for a date night and it was just perfect. The staff is fantastic and attentive. I definitely suggest this place for a date night or special occasion!
"I would agree with the masses that this place gets 5 stars.  I would always eat across the street peering over to see what HB was about.  Luckily, there was an hour wait at Chicago Diner so we strolled across the street.  Even though HB was crowded as well, they were able to find me and my partner a table.Very cute, small, and intimate space.We started off with focaccia bread with a balsamic vinegar dip. Tasty.Then for our main dish, we ordered the Amish Chicken with risotto.  And a special, Stripped Bass (the entire fish, head, tail and all).  That was a first for me having the entire fish in front of me.  All I have to say was it was very flavorful.  The chicken was plump and juicy. A must have.Excellent over all!!!"
"Awesome food, service and atmosphere....and it's BYOB! Took my girlfriend here and she loved it!"
"Never made it for dinner, but the brunch was my favorite when I lived in Chicago.Beignet as a breakfast app for the table?  Yes, please!"
"love love love this place- but have only been for breakfast so can't speak to the rest. Our server each time was super friendly and informative. Lots of different unique selections vs your plain old bacon and eggs dishes. Also AMAZING bloody mary's. If you go when its nice out, definitely try to grab a table out on the patio. Cute relaxing atmosphere!"
"Bold flavors, warm and inviting atmosphere, friendly staff, and creative dishes; HB hits on all cylinders.  HB reminds me of eating at a small cafe in Europe.  And yes, it is BYOB!The entire meal was great from the starters, entrees, to the dessert.  Highlights include the escargot, truffle fries, and Amsterdam style mussels.  The escargot was absolutely amazing.  It was fresh, light, and blended with mandarin oranges and fresh herbs.  The contrast in acids and flavors came together as a whole and worked brilliantly.  Best escargot I've ever had.The chef creates 3-4 special entrees each night that he whips up from ingredients bought at local markets.  I had one of the specials: Zunrkol.  It was a pork chop resting on a white wine and vinegar broth with braised cabbage, pork sausage, and caraway.  It was explosive with flavors that I can't stop thinking about.  When the head chef came out to talk to us, I asked him about the special.  Chef Joncarl said he picked up some pork chops earlier that day and decided to make a Dutch dish he grew up with.  It was just amazing.  Stop reading reviews and just go there."
"Based on earlier reviews and the proximity to friends who live down the street, we decided to grab dinner at HB last night. I had eaten here a few  time with mixed results. Last night being the weakest of the three. The best part of the meal was the company. Also worth pointing out our server did a nice job although the place was certainly not jamm'n for a Friday night.The restaurant was way hot. I mean like temperature hot. Front door was open, so I assume the AC was broken. Pacing of our courses was super slow. Fortunately we had our BYOB to keep us company.The food? eeesh...probably one of the worst meals I have ever paid for.  4 apps + 4 mains = FAIL. Not a one was a keeper, Three fish dishes all charred. A lamb with Gnocchi plus walnuts, raw snap pees and a few other not sure why they were there components.Maybe the chef was off for the 4th of July weekend. Maybe not. I don't plan to go back to find out"
"We just got back from our second visit to HB and this review will not conflict with the others. I just wanted to give an update on some of their specials. He had the homemade sausages and I had the venison meatballs with fettuccine.The sausages edged out the venison by just a hair in the ""who ordered the best"" game. They were the right mix of ground meat, rice and spices to make them tasty and lean. The greens they were served with were great. My venison meatballs and fettuccine were good. The tomato sauce has a sweet note to it which I wasn't expecting. The table next to us ordered it as well and made the same comment. To be clear, we both enjoyed the dish; it just was a surprise to have a sweeter sauce.They were advertising fried chicken skins which I wish we could have ordered. Perhaps next time.So check out HB if you haven't. You will have a good experience at a lively place that doesn't have TVs on every wall (thank you!) with excellent food quality and charming service."
"My favorite restaurant.  Period.  I've eaten at a lot of restaurants in Chicago and HB is absurdly amazing.  You get a reasonable (but filling) amount of food.  Joncarl is simply delightful.  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu but truffle fries and bread pudding are a must for anyone new.  I hate to make this place more popular, but it's truly and honestly responsible for some of my favorite memories and meals in my life."
"Wow. By far the best restaurant I've BYOB'd ever.I came in town for a wedding as with some others. My friend and I decided to come here for a little classy dinner style. We somehow got a table with 11 on a Friday night and had a fantastically drunk and tasty 2 hours. The waiter was patient, helpful and energetic. The prices were reasonable and the food--awesome.With at least 4 other people, I got the quail, which was one of the best meals I've had at a restaurant... ever. With ratatouille, to add. We were the last people in the restaurant and drunkenly walked out for an even drunker late evening."
"My experience @ the Home Bistro was fantastic from start to finish. I had made a reservation over the phone for around 8 o'clock, my date & I showed up about 15 minutes early but were sat immediately at what appeared to be the only available table. The staff was knowledgeable, energized & helpful; not always the combination you get for an evening meal but definitely what I'm looking for. The location is in Boys-town, which I really have no problem with aside from the fact that there is never anywhere to park. My date & I turned away after a 20 minute bout trying to find parking; that doesn't motivate me to head back anytime soon which is too bad because I'm dying to have the oysters amsterdam style again.If you enjoy quality and passion in your dining experience, treat yourself to this gem of a restaurant."
I really wanted to love this place. It's cute and our server was fantastic. The problem is that our group of four ordered seven different things and we all agreed there was only one that we'd order again (fried oysters on polenta). Everything else was OK but not  great. I was never here under the old owner/management but I have a feeling they're surviving on reputation and friendliness at this point. I'll give it a few months and check back on yelp to decide if I'll return.
"Was in Chicago, IL visiting a friend for a mini vacation. I'm originally from LA and we really don't have nearly a diverse a neighborhood food culture that all the Chigagoans seems to have.In fact I haven't even ever heard of a BYOB until I came here....Well, I have to say, I really can't give this place nearly enough praise. The service was great (though a bit leisurely, which I actually enjoy since when I go out, I want to enjoy my evening eating), The host at the front of the house was amazing and kept checking on us all night for feedback and would talk to us about how the restaurant began and everything. finally, The food...the Food was spectacular. For the evening, my friend and I started by sharing a half order of their Amsterdam Style Black Mussels, a plate of their Almond Stuffed Dates wrapped in Bacon, The Crispy Veal Sweetbreads and the Housemade Pierogi.   I can't really say which I reccommend more since each one was delicious in it's own right. Here is a quick rundown:Black Mussels: These are the most uniquely spiced mussels I have ever had. I eat a lot of Belgian style Black Mussels and these are probably the most different I've ever had them. The sauce was deliciously spiced in this amazing beer broth that also has star anise and basil in it. Defintiely delicious and different from other black Mussels I've eaten.Almond stuffed Date wrapped in Bacon: It's sweet, it's savory, it's crunchy and nutty. There are simply so many flavors and textures packed into the little delicious morsels. I could seriously eat like an entire bowl of just these. Part of the best things about them is when you get some of the crispy brown sugar crust on it that gives you like a nice burst of sweetness right before you get to the crispy and salty bacon. Veal Sweetbreads: I love Sweetbreads. These were amazing and came with this amazing house made jalenpeno based hot sauce to go with it. these was crunchy on the outside, but had this rich and tender texture on the inside and played extraordinarily well with the homemade hot sauce.Pierogi: Soft and delicate with this outstanding  foie gras mousse stuffing that interacts so well with the creaminess of the benecdictine spread and the sweetness of the plum jam on top. Definitely a huge burst of flavors with every bite.For out main entrees, my friend had the braised Pork Shank and I had one of their specials, the Crispy Pork Belly. The Pork Belly was amazing. It was crunchy and crispy on the outside, but had this remarkable creaminess to the inside. the sauce it came with was nutty and savory. The Fresh cherry tomatoes just popped in your mouth like little bubbles of flavor. It was fantastic.Finally for the dessert, we shared a decadent Chocolate Banana Brioche Bread Pudding. Now, I've eaten a lot of bread pudding in my life, some great, some not so great. This ranks pretty high up their for me. The chocolate they used wasn't too sweet and had a great bite to it. the bread still had texture with the creaminess.The best part of this meal, however, was the value of it all. back in LA, this would easily cost me double what I paid for it at HB. It was fantastic. They give you quite the bang for your buck. Plus, the host was telling us that they have an even better deal on Wednesdays where you can build your own Prix fixe menu for about $30. I highly recommend this place to everyone. Hell, I'd fly back to Chicago just to come here..."
"Ate here last night -- it was only my second time, which is sad because it's right down the street from me!Went for the ever-popular prix-fixe and couldn't have been happier. What really surprised me, though, was HOW MUCH FOOD came with this -- good lord. It was definitely a bit much for two people -- one appetizer, one salad or dessert, and one entree each per person -- but that's definitely not a bad thing for $30! Just prepare to be stuffed, or don't eat much the rest of the day!My mom and I ordered the heirloom tomato and arugula special, the artichoke fritters, the charred corn salad, the pepper parpadelle, the veal bolognese special and the bread pudding.The heirloom tomato appetizer/salad was outstanding, but it's not hard to mess up tomatoes, arugula, olive oil and salt, haha. Nonetheless, I really enjoyed that they made a special point to fit the last of the season's tomatoes into their menu and I was not disappointed! The egg topping was a little strange, but not bad.The artichoke and edam cheese frittes were AMAZING. I mistakenly thought they meant edamame, but this cheese was a welcome surprise. These taste like a cross between hush puppies and super rich artichoke...something. They're not light, so we almost didn't finish them. Almost...The charred corn salad was probably my least favorite. It wasn't bad, but it was just a random mix of things and didn't really do it for me, but I'm also not too big on corn. The spicy walnut crunchy things in it were pretty good though.Both pasta entrees were absolutely incredible. I licked my plate clean, and took home my mom's leftovers (sorry mom!). The homemade pasta was especially amazing in the parpadelle -- super dense and chewy, but not in a bad way. I didn't want either of these dishes to end.Finally...well, just make sure you order the bread pudding if it's on the menu. I can't even do it justice, but I imagine it's made with an entire stick of butter. It was out of this world, and a huge portion (enough for 2-3 easily) to boot. Seriously, get this stuff -- you will die happily.Make reservations early, especially for Wednesdays. Small, intimate place with only 1 or 2 waiters, but we never felt neglected. Amazing. Love this place."
"I have been coming here for years now, and without a doubt Home Bistro is my favorite restaurant in all of Chicago. The always seasonal menu is a delight, and even if Joncarl is not here personally cooking, the very talented Cooper and Victor are rocking that kitchen with the same passion.So let me tell you about our food!  This time around, rock shrimp and crab ceviche. Light and refreshing, the ceviche was a perfect foil for My Honey's battered Rabbit Confit (omg!) which was tender, crispy and ever so flavorful. My braised pork shank you ask? Fall off the bone tender, with a jus so full of flavor, I could have had a bowl of it with some of their delicious rye bread.Dessert was a very delicious strawberry/apricot crisp, the topping was crispy, nutty and topped with softly whipped cream.  Yum on top of yum, on top of yum.Lastly, let me tell you about the service.  Warm, friendly and simply so desirous to make you the guest happy, A superior dining experience."
"I wanted HB to be 5 star, especially after reading all the great reviews.  I had my expectations set pretty high.  The service was 5 star, the people working there were 5 star but the food some of it was hit or miss.What we had:Artichoke Edam Fritters - these were great!  Flavoring was perfect, they weren't over or under cooked either.  I was pleasantly surprised with the flavor or Edam - I really enjoyed it.Bread they serve as you wait - this was also great.  It was warm, flavored nice and had a balsamic to dip in - I found myself wishing they refilled our bread!I had the Lamb Shank which was a stew with root veggies in a tomato broth served over couscous.  There was a cinnamon flavor to it which was good but at times a little overpowering.  The lamb was good and tender but the dinner was cold.  I didn't and still don't know if it's supposed to be served cold but given it was, the couscous was cold and soggy.  This was kind of disappointing to me.  My husband had the Rainbow Trout which of course I taste tested and it was way too salty for my liking.We finished with dessert.  I will admit - I was hoping they had a chocolate option but they didn't have one.  I decided to go with the Eggnog Bread Pudding.  What I liked was the actual bread pudding, it was flavorful, easy to pull apart.  What I didn't like - it was missing the Eggnog flavor!  If it was just a bread pudding dessert it would be a hit but since it's supposed to be an eggnog flavored bread pudding and it's missing that flavor, it can be a let down.I liked the restaurant, it is small and it can get loud, but it has a very quaint feel to it.  I liked the people working there, they were helpful, friendly, went out of their way to make sure you were comfortable.  I wasn't blown away by the food.  That being said, I would like to try it again because maybe it was an off night - you never know.HB is worth going to, there are a lot of great things about this restaurant.  I will be going back...and another added bonus is that it's BYOB!"
"I went here with great anticipation last week, with a college friend in tow. I have to say I was underwhelmed, given all the lavish reviews on here. Are restaurants just getting more mediocre, or is my palate getting more refined? Or am I just getting to be an ol' picky beeyatch?It's BYOB, which we love. Our waiter was cute and charming . . . which we love. However, in the HB neighborhood, ""cute and charming"" is in great supply, nay, a girl trips over ""cute and charming"" all the way up and down Halsted.The food. I was so excited to try this place and I have to say it was a bit disappointing.My college friend's SO ordered the trout. That was probably the best entree, and his exclamation ""this is the moist-est fish I've ever eaten!"" was accurate. Or maybe I just like saying the word ""moist"". Mmmmmoist. However, I thought there should have been an offer to filet the fish at the table - if for nothing else but to admire the server's arms. Hey! No! Because of the many tiny bones that made it a bit hard to eat.Mine and 7star companion's food was just kind of meh. Overcooked. Sort of mushy. I had the catfish over gumbo and he had the pork special - which *sounded* delicious at least. But . . . meh. Just . . . unimpressive. And I don't like a giant bill for ""unimpressive"".I'd probably give this place another chance, maybe for their weekday special. It was also REALLY CROWDED and a bit claustrophobic and LOUD."
"Prix Fixe'd it last night for a special night ;) It was a last minute decision, so at 6:30 I called up to make reservations for 8:30, which they complied with...step 1 complete. The host did mention that it was BYOB, so I went and got my favorite lambic beer...step 2 complete. I got in the taxi, made it to the restaurant and gave my name to be seated at the table...step 3? Nope, not complete yet. The tables were all full and people were taking their time, which didn't bother me because I understand, plus the place is so small. The host did take the beer I brought and put it in the cooler, which was fantabulous. The weather was nice so we stayed outside and talked, since it's terribly loud inside. The wait was longer than expected so we were given complimentary bacon wrapped dates while waiting outside (not bad at all). Finally, the table opens up...step 3 complete. We order the prix fixe menu - an appetizer/salad, main entree and dessert. The escargot appetizer was very delicious and had a great flavoring to it. The duck and plum plate I ordered was interesting and definitely not my thing. It was looked like cat food, but I guess some people like this stuff. For me, I'll pass, though I'm sure it was cooked great for those who like it. Then the food arrived; I had the haddock, she had the pasta. Both were tasty and filling - not the best, but very good. Then the end of the meal came, which was dessert. We both had the bread pudding, but with different toppings. Yummy! Step 4 complete. All in all, a good place to chill, drink your own liquor with no extra fees, have fantastic service, and eat new foods...step 5 complete."
"I would love to give them 3 stars but they basically ignored me and my party of 9 the entire night.  They promised us the table behind the host station and instead put us in the middle of the room with 8 settings.  It was my birthday and they didn't put a candle in the desert and didn't even acknowledge me (the person who made the reservations) the whole night.  They didn't ever come back to ask how we were doing with our food despite our accommodating their request to have the ""family style"" meal.  WE accommodated THEM.  I would also give them higher marks except the food was so close....but not there.  It's really too bad because they have a very warm environment and a lovely sounding menu.  If they had just not been so ""snarky"" about the menu..and not alienated me and my friends, I would cut them some slack on the food.  Just because you offer BYOB doesn't give you the right to act like you're doing us a favor. Maybe they had a bad night."
"Dined here for my birthday dinner last Friday, and what a lovely meal we had!!!  Walking in, it's a cute, small space, yet very casual and cozy.  Service was so excellent and helpful, from our host to our two servers.  We all ordered appetizers and entrees in our party of four.  The bacon wrapped dates, escargot, and the beet salad were all superb.  I got the lamb sweetbreads, which were really great with the roasted grapes.  It was probably the worst of the four appetizers, but none the less AMAZING.For entrees we got the bouillabaisse, the rainbow trout, the soft shell crab, and my favorite, the beef tongue.  The beef tongue was served on top of polenta, and all the flavors were outstanding.  Three of these were the specials for the evening, and we could all see why.  All our entrees were out of this world!  We were bitter about not ordering dessert, but we were all so full!BYOB keeps the price down, which is really a plus.  My only two qualms about the evening was a) the unisex bathroom.  Men are disgusting, and I don't think the bathroom gets cleaned often throughout the dinner shift.  B) the acoustics in the room need some work, you sort of have to shout at your dinner companions.  Neither of these horribly affected our otherwise amazing experience."
"Been meaning to try this place out for a LONG time! Finally got there last night, with a group of 4. I loved it, and will definitely go back! The friend who highly recommended it said the menu changes often, but recommended the majority of the dishes we ended up choosing. We started out with the olives,only cuz I was craving them with the wine, they were good, not spectacular, I probably won't get them again. But, all 4 of us agreed the escargot appetizer was excellent, and one of the best we've ever had...(& all 4 of us are food & wine snobs). We also had the white anchovies with mozzarella cheese and pesto sauce...not something I would normally get, but we thought it sounded interesting, and we all really liked it. The 2nd best app, was the artichoke edam fritters. Edam is a type of cheese, and although I'm not a big fan of fried foods, these are REALLY good! Definitely great to share!Both guys got the lamb breast. The dish was full of flavor, but a bit too much of a fatty cut for my husband. I was debating between the trout and mussels, but my friend and I both got the mussels, and they were delicious and generous portion. In the end she & her husband agreed that too many of them were served closed though.I'd definitely order them again though! They come served with truffle fries that were pretty good! My husband ate most of mine:) We were too full for dessert, but was told the bread pudding is excellent."
"I want to HB Restaurant back in July during a girls trip/ lower key bachelorette party trip to Chicago. We stumbled upon Home Bistro later on a Saturday early in the evening when having trouble with a reservation online, we called and the staff there was very courteous and managed to find us a spot later that evening. As the HB is BYOB, We stopped at a wine shop near our hotel and picked up a couple bottles of wine, and all in all it was probably one of the best BYOB dinners I've ever had. The ambiance in the restaurant was intimate and amazing, even with our late reservations.  4 of us split two of the artichoke and edam fritters to start (highly recommend), and then we each got our own meal. As I am writing this review late, I cannot comment on what we ate except that it was all exceptional. Service was friendly and engaging and we all agreed we would be back the next time we took a trip to Chicago."
"""HB Restaurant embodies flawless execution in every sense of the notion"" - Brett DI could wax poetic for days about my love for HB, but I think just one sentence in Brett D's review captures the essence of HB perfectly.  Umm.  I probably shouldn't announce this publicly, but...oh, here goes.  I would whore myself out to eat here and to experience HB's exceptional service, even if I was penniless and broken.  I might even be convinced to donate a kidney to a total stranger, if only I was given the chance to have some of Jon Carl's caramel bread pudding once a week for the rest of my life.  It's that good, that lovely. Everything I tried I loved.  Some dishes, I loved a bit more than others perhaps.  But, I was never disappointed with a single plate that emerged from HB's kitchen. I can't say much more, put I will leave you with some food porn photos so you can drool at the thought of eating here as well."
Yes! Evening with fam. Byob. We loved everything. A gobacker!
"I went here  with my boyfriend on a Wednesday for the fixed price deal (it's a great deal). He's been begging me for months and I was skeptical! I am soooo glad that I went! I'd go back for the appetizers alone! Try the bacon wrapped dates AND the artichoke fritters. You won't even need to go further! These were two of the best appetizers I've EVER had.    Bring in your own bottle of wine, this is a warm environment that's great for a date or a heart to heart with a friend!Definitely worth trying!"
"First of all, the food here is very tasty and creative. MAKE A RESERVATION.The atmosphere is nice and romantic and it's BYOB. Things to try:1. Bacon Wrapped Dates (inspired by somewhere the owner visited in Spain!)2. Braised Pork3. Praline (made in house)4. Bread Pudding (usually a flavor of the month)Everything we had was so delicious, the owner treated us like family and our waiter was so fun. He made wonderful suggestions and even pointed me in the direction of a wine store (literally - it's right down the road)!Great restaurant - highly recommended."
"My favorite restaurant in Chicago, hands down.  We've been here close to a dozen times now, and only one time have we ever not been truly satisfied with our meal.  When the waitstaff came by later and noticed my date's plate was mostly uneaten, she asked if something was wrong.  The chef then came out and apologized, and they wound up comping the entree of our bill.With that one exception aside, the food is always above average and usually excellent, and the waitstaff really make the place great.  BYOB is also a great plus.Now that the executive chef has changed, it will be interesting to see how HB fares.  The menu has changed and not necessarily for the better (where is the duck breast!?!) but hopefully it will go through some more refinement."
Excellent! Came for New Year's set menu. Food and service were excellent!
"Short story about HB...my buddy was adventurous and got the beef tongue. It was actually pretty darn good. My girlfriend couldn't deal with the texture, but I'm sure you have to know what you're doing in order to pull that dish off. Otherwise, my only qualm would be that we literally waited for 10 minutes for someone to open our wine (BYOB!) after waiting for our reservation. Either way, we slammed down 4 bottles of wine in no time for a comedy show."
"HB is a restaurant with delicious food for the non-foodie - and its BYOB!  I recommend going on a Wednesday (with reservations) for their fixed price 3 course menu. There is a wine shop across the street if you forget wine.The menu changes often, but I definitely recommend the bacon wrapped dates, the artichoke fritters and the escargot for appetizers. For mains, I've had duck, salmon, short rib and rabbit...always amazing. And for dessert, there always seems to be some sort of bread pudding - to die for."
"Five MOTHER F'ING STARS for HB. Personally, I think it is the best food in the neighborhood. Amazing and delicious. Food, service, atmosphere. All just makes me scream YES YES YES.I came here specifically for the lamb burger. No matter what the special was or what was recommended, this is what I wanted.I was with my boyfriend (and another couple) and we started with the bacon-wrapped dates and beet salad. I thought the dates were average, and possibly better in some tapas restaurants. They didn't come with any sauce and I think it needed it. The beet salad was wonderful. I honestly don't even know what a beet is. We ordered the salad for the feta cheese, which was as delicious as expected. The beets had a nice smooth flavor that complemented the salad well. The salad was big enough to share for an appetizer. I ordered the lamb burger and it did not disappoint. AMAZING. OMG. This was by far one of the greatest things I have ever eaten IN MY LIFE. The burger was GIGANTIC and so rich and juicy. I could not stop licking my fingers. The fries were borderline orgasmic and would be included in my last meal on earth. They give a mayo dipping sauce, which would normally be a turn off, but it works. And works so well! My boy got the chicken wrapped in phyllo and he LOVED it. I had a bite and all I could think of was ""Boy this really does taste Moroccan."" I don't really know what that means, but if you try it, you will understand.As for the other couple, they started with the heirloom tomatoes which were salty. They also ordered the mussels and the lamb burger. Burger was a great, but the mussels were average.Here are some tips: Make a reservation! Bring your own wine (I splurged for the Trader Joes Charles Shaw. Classy). Dont get there too early because there is not to much room to wait.Please go ASAP and invite me for some truffle fries."
"Food: 3Decor: 3Service: 3My date and I had dinner here around 7pm on a Sunday. I made a reservation the afternoon before without any problems.1. ALMOND STUFFED DATES 9wrapped in bacon, baked with brown sugar~Yummy. A tad sticky, but good finger food.2. BRAISED PORK SHANK 21spaetzle, jus, hen of the woods, pickled peach salsa~Good. Pork was cooked perfectly and fell off the bone. Pickled salsa was a bit odd, and the food got cold too fast.3. ""AMSTERDAM STYLE"" MUSSELS 19beer broth, anise, dried basil, garlic, truffle fries~Okay. Mussels were very good, but they got cold way too fast since they weren't put into a clay pot. The broth was also at the bottom, so I couldn't get at it until I had cleared out half my mussels. There was also sand in some of them. Truffle fries were pretty good, especially with the butter.Total was about $70 after tax/tip.Service was okay. It took a while to get my check, even though I told one server that I needed to leave asap since my meter was up. At least she was pretty friendly.Decor is warm and friendly. However, it is pretty cramped and loud."
"If you want good quality food with a top atmosphere and GREAT service, this is your place.First of all, my husband and I plan entire vacations around food. If we don't like a place the first time, we simply don't return. We have no qualms with spending $250+ on a dinner (with a bit of alcohol) and spend a good portion of our income on food alone. Needless to say, we enjoy good food. My husband and I have dined at HB many times and have yet to have anything less than a wonderful experience. The food is rich and delicious, the staff is warm and welcoming and the Chef is gracious and knows what he is doing. The atmosphere is dimly lit (We always go at night) and the decorative style is somewhere between old world Italian and country chic. I simply love it!If you have not been, you should give it a try. I recommend the pate, escargot, cheese plate for appetizer; beef cheeks, short rib, mussels, pork shank, or any pasta dish for the entree; and the lemon tart is to die for :)PS: ITS BYOB!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Was expecting to be blown away based on all the reviews. Sadly, what a let down. First, fitting four people around a tiny table really makes for a cramped and uncomfortable dinner. We struggled half the night to find a place for the wine and the water and the appetizers and forget about the bread plate. That coupled with the fact that the very near neighboring table was also packed with 4 peeps, it was a nightmare.The foccacia bread to start was dry. The balsamic needed some olive oil to spruce it up. The appetizers were alright. The fritters were cooked too much that their shells were burnt dark brown. The figs wrapped in bacon were also overly cooked and just had that bitter bite at the end.I liked my paparadelle a lot but wish it was served hot. The noodles were tasty and cooked properly but luke warm. That was off putting.Dessert was a total let down. Who doesn't have a chocolate dessert option? No thanks to the bread pudding or some sort of custardy thing. Get some chocolate stuff on the dessert list!Would have loved to have been blown away coming in with such high expectation but it was just mediocre, at best."
"My roommate and I enjoyed our experience there. Very good service and good food. I believe it's byob, added bonus."
"I wanted to like HB, I really, really did. But it just was too many problems to be considered a good experience.I will say the staff was great. We were greeted with a smile and sat almost immediately. Our server was right there and very friendly. Also knowledgeable of the menu. Unfortunately, that was the last we saw of him until our bill came. He never came back to check on us the entire meal.The food itself tasted great. I shared the ceviche with my wife which she really enjoyed, I found it so-so. She ordered the crispy gnocchi which I sampled and really enjoyed. Definitely a rich dish though. I had the special which was a BBQ quail which was very good and served on top of some excellent creamed corn. The problem? It took FOREVER to get the food. We didn't get our food for over 45 minutes. It was good but not worth the wait. Also, it's super dark in the restaurant. I was able to get through the menu but when the food came I could barely seen anything. And with quail I want to make sure I'm not eating any bones.The final negative was the noise. There's loud pop music playing and in that small a place everyone else talking makes it even nosier. It was difficult to hear my wife sitting next to me and it made the small cozy place seem more chaotic than it is.I enjoyed the food but with all the other problems this is going to be a place that I might not go back to again for some time."
"HB Restaurant is a quality experience from the moment you arrive to the moment you leave. We recently stopped by for dinner on a Sunday night, and I had the pleasure of eating one of the best meals of my entire life. Upon entering the rustic room, you are quickly and pleasantly greeted by the host. My boyfriend and I were given a choice of seating, immediately handed menus, and told of their BYOB option. We hadn't remembered wine, but our dinner sparkled on its own, needing no accompaniment. Our water glasses were filled quickly (and kept full throughout the night) and our friendly server told us about the night's specials. We decided to split the Bibb Lettuce with Roasted Pear Salad, and I must say it was one of the yummiest salads I've ever had. They made it so easy to split the salad, and just brought it out on two different plates, putting the crumbled amish bleu cheese on the side (it was definitely big enough to split). For entrees, my boyfriend got the 12 Hour Braised Beef Brisket, while I opted for the night's special. It was a mix of slow roasted pork shoulder, cabbage, potatoes au gratin, sausage, bites of duck....I can't even name all the lovely little tastes I had. This dish was honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten. Hot, savory, sour, creamy, sweet, the flavors were so perfectly balanced, each bite was like a little treat. Not to mention the portions: I ate to my heart's content, and still had enough for a full meal the next day (bonus: the meal was even great heated up in the stove)The service was gracious and classy, the prices reasonable, the portions large, the food phenomenal. You don't get much better than HB Restaurant."
"Just a few comments I made during dinner at HB last night:""How have I not been here before!""""I want to come here every night!""""Hmm...maybe I should just move in?""Yes, it's THAT good! HB had me at the cozy, romantic atmosphere and that it's BYOB, but it was the food that really blew me away....Appetizers:Shrimp cake (a special of the evening): um, delish!Almond stuffed dates: Yep, the hype about these is true. And I didn't even think I liked dates, but apparently I do once you wrap them in bacon and bake them in brown sugar.  Entrees:Salmon for me: I ate every last biteChicken for my friend: loved the mushroom risotto that came with itMussels for my friend's man: Largest portion of mussels and fries I've ever seen and I think he enjoyed it because he ate it all. We were hoping for a free meal since he's probably the only person able to finish those mussels, but not so much.Pork pie special for my husband: He only ordered this after making sure my friend dining with us (who works for the Jewish Federation) wasn't offended.  I had a few bites (sshhh- don't tell my rabbi) of this dish that resembled a shepard's pie, but was so much better. YUM!Dessert:2 orders of bread pudding, because we couldn't get 1 after reading the rave reviews for it on Yelp.  And OMG, we should have ordered 4 orders of it.The portions were quite large and it ended up being about $75/couple (love that byob makes everything more affordable), which is quite a good deal for the quality of the food/service.Yeah, I think I may just move in.  Don't worry HB, I'll bring my own air mattress...just get some bread pudding ready for my stay!"
"Happened to make a reservation on Wednesday before thanksgiving, HB was offering full menu for 3 course prix fixe. $30pp. Such great food! Great service too. Special app for the evening was duck wings. They were fantastic! Crispy outside tender and juicy inside with perfect blend of spicy, savory, salt, and sweet. Home run!Entree lamb shank was awesome as well. FYI HB is BYOB. Will return on our next trip to Chicago!"
"HB is great, so much so that we've gone there twice in the last week!  I must say that all of the food we had was excellent.  We had the mussels entree for an appetizer, which was a great rec from the server.  Huge amount of mussels and even better....it came with a side of frites, which were delicious!  Great value for $18.  All of the entrees were delicious, especially the pork and the lamb burger.  My only complaint is that if you go on a Sunday, they seemed to have run out of a lot of items, but the servers are super helpful and will tell you up front what they are running low on.  The best thing about this spot is that they are totally BYO and they even seem to encourage you to bring a bottle or two along.  In fact, when I made my reservation, the guy went out of his way to mention they were BYO.  Now that is absurd!!  There aren't many places in Chicago who are cool enough to do that for you.  And even if you forget there are a couple of wine stores down Halsted that you can run over to an grab a bottle. Great food, and great value.  Nuff said."
"HOLY CRAP.  This is the easiest 5 star rating I have ever given.  Absolutely everything I put in my mouth at this restaurant was unbelievable.  I don't even know where to begin when recommending dishes; I went with a party of 8 and we ordered well over half the menu.  I guess if forced to pick standouts: fried artichoke appetizer, bacon wrapped date appetizer, mac n' cheese part of the chicken entree, truffle fries which they let us order as a side when we asked, hoho dessert.  But honestly, everything ordered was amazing.Other notes, the portions are generous, considering it's not Italian or Chinese, or some other typically big portion cuisine.  The service was great, even with a party of 8.  They take reservations.  Prices are reasonable - apps just under 10, entrees between 15 and 20.  AND as if it's not heavenly enough already, it's BYOB with NO corkage fee!!!!!  They didn't even seem put off by our group's ability to split 10 bottles of wine between 8 people.  I will SOOOOOO be back, and not soon enough."
"Can I just say ""bookmark now""? Would that be a sufficient review? Probably not, I'm just nervous... I know at times I get a little carried away with loquacious narratives on each minute detail of a fabulous dining experience - I can't help it, I'm just so excitable - that I fear you'll grow tired of my rambling and never get the full picture. I see you over there rolling your eyes and clicking away from me in favor of capricious reviews on 'dibs' and 'love'. The surplus of studies on plastic chairs aren't going anywhere, promise. Just stick with me, will ya? And if the maddening ants in your pants won't give on their hold, then like I said, bookmark now - you won't be sorry!! HB Restaurant embodies flawless execution in every sense of the notion... From the get-go, planning the January Yelp GNO (Girls Night Out. Duh) dinner was pure simplicity... from selecting the menu, to organizing seating, to working with the staff, things couldn't have been easier on me, truly. I dig the easy button!! Fortunately, once we arrived, the evening's experience wholly followed suit. HB's exec chef, Joncarl Lachman, whom I worked with directly made our evening total enchantment. Really. I know I'm getting all Walt Disney on you, but ask my posse, our event was magical. Perhaps it was the fantastic food or maybe the flattering surroundings? You know what I mean about flattery. Anyone who has ever suffered from a case of bad lighting on a date hears me and should head to HB for refuge!! With buttery yellow walls, oodles of candlelight, cinnamon scented air, sexy vintage mirrors and heaps of charm, I felt very at home bathed in a glow of the HB brand of fabulousness. The new 'chubby' J.Simp should head here for some ego boosting stat. Speaking of chubby, let's talk chow... after all, it was the best part! Take advantage of their BYOB factor (yes!!) and bring some of your best bubbles or vino to pair with the extraordinary, eclectic menu. If you're not hitting up HB en masse as we did, give them a whirl on Wednesdays when they highlight their prix-fixe magnificence - 3 courses, $29, such a steal! The favs on my hit list were the apps of haloumi cheese with rose petal jam - so melty, salty, sweet - divine! And of course, the bacon wrapped dates that came in a silky coat of brown sugah love, plenty to share with friends! My entrée (also the house specialty), the choucroute was a shellfish lovers dream... piled high with shrimp, mussels, clams and smoked sausage on a bed of mashed potatoes I cried a little bit while eating it. Food porn is so choice. Taking little bites here and there off everyone's plate I can attest that each dish (mushroom risotto, pork loin, Moroccan chicken, etc. etc.) is adorned with only the freshest ingredients, and not a dud in the bunch. Dessert is no joke, either. HB takes their sweets seriously and took me right to the moon with their blood orange creamsickle mousse ala 'dream foam' and gooey pineapple bread pudding. OMFG! I'd bathe in the pudding if there wasn't a hygiene issue there... clearly I enjoyed myself. Big thanks to the HB crew, you can see we have no shortage of great things to say about you... and whaddya know, I already have plans to go back... foam party part deux!"
"Let me see here....Champagne...BYO champagne. Adequate champagne flutes....hooray!Cozy space in Boystown, but they seated 24 of us perfectly! (call ahead)Quote from Miss Piggy on the wall: ""Never eat more than you can lift."" ha!Accommodating staff from the get go...fabulous service for a large party. And, that was before we even got to the food!Oh, god. The food....Appetizers: Edam fritters with aoli sauce, clove of garlic. Swaddle me in it when I pass, mmmmk? I will surely get into heaven if this is with me...Bacon wrapped dates with brown sugar...mercy. Crabcake + slaw: a hit. Entrees:Mussels with truffle fries. TRUFFLE FRIES! (in case you missed it, I certainly did not)Mushroom risotto. The finishing touch...A myriad of desserts flew to the table: chocolate bundts, orangey dreamsicle concoctions. Lord, help me. And then, I had had enough lovely food and lovely champagne (thank you Carol K), and fantastic company (thank you yelpettes!). It was a Tuesday after all....so I made my way home in the blustery cold, tucked myself in content with one of the best meals in recent history. And, I eat out...a lot. Looking for a BYOB Vday weekend date spot? I'd make reservations, STAT. The secret is out."
"Wow, I think I found a new favorite restaurant. The restaurant is darkly lit and super romantic. Walking in here, the place has a warm and homey feel. The staff was super nice when I got in and offered to put my bottles of wine in the fridge until they were needed. The staff was also super accomodating in waiting for all of the Yelpettes to arrive for GNO. For an appetizer, I had the broiled haloumi cheese. Wow, that cheese is good. My pieces were perfectly broiled and extremely tasty. Megan G. commented to me that it tasted a lot like saganaki. I was a little confused by the piece of rye bread and how to use it for the appetizer, but it was still good. I sampled the crab cake and all I can say is wow. The crab cake was delicious. In between the appetizer and entree, I enjoyed the salad. It was a perfect salad of dark greens and a light vinagarette. Also, I had a piece of their bread. I want that bread and lots of it. It was fluffy, moist, and flavorful. It was only made better by the balsamic vinegar on the bottom. That bread made my carb cravings even worse because it was so good.For my entree, I had the broiled salmon. My piece of salmon was a little overbroiled, but still satisfying. The polenta and vegetables underneath the salmon were amazing. I tried some of the wild mushroom risotto. That was the richest, most decadent risotto I've ever tasted. Sarah L's moroccan couscous stew smelled amazing and further reinforced the homey nature of this restaurant. I tried one of the truffle fries from another Yelpette. I could eat those fries day in and day out and be the happiest person ever.  The incredible staff brought us the whole selection of desserts for everyone to try. They really know how to please us! The pineapple bread pudding was dream worthy. It was light and sugary. My favorite dessert was the blood orange creamsicle mousse. I'm still dreaming about it days later. Run of the mill creamsicles won't do after that. The chocolate chip bundt cake was good. It was rich, but just not my favorite dessert. Overall, HB is a great restaurant. The service was impeccible and being BYOB was also nice. I'll come back for the food, service, and ambience for sure."
"I am just not a fan of HB. I may try it again sometime (as I am moving not far from it) - then again with so many culinary excursions to venture out upon in this fair city, I may not. I went for the lamb burger, as L'Express in NYC makes an excellent lamb burger indeed. The one at HB? No thanks.  Too gamy, greasy, and entirely uninspired. The waitstaff was also unpleasant, and tended to ignore our party of three most of the time, despite trying desperately to get their attention several times.  I know people love this place - but hey, to each his own. It just leaves more for you to enjoy ;)  At least it's BYOB ;p"
"The three of us went in after hearing so many good things about this place. I'll keep it short with the things you need to know:- BYOB- food takes a while so don't go when you're starving- if you're celebrating, bring cake so they can serve it for you after your meal- specials are usually beautiful + delicious- don't forget to read the miss piggy quote on the wall"
"I loved this restaurant. After a lovely GNO dinner at HB, it is apparent that the owners and chef are passionate about food, service and fun. The ambiance is rustic and charming, and the lighting made my skin look fantastic. Another great part of the decor is the large mirrors on the wall - they allowed me to check my lipstick without busting out my purse. Here were the evening's other highlights.1. The almond stuffed dates were so good. I could have eating 10 of them, but didn't!2. The crabcakes were equally as delicious. The portion size was quite large - it could have been a meal.3. The simple green salad was a fantastic palette cleanser.4. The shellfish entree didn't knock my socks off, but was pretty good. 5. DESSERT. My favorites were the pineapple bread pudding and blood orange mousse. I swear my eyes rolled back in pleasure. I will definitely be back. Thanks, ladies for a most lovely evening."
"This place was amazing and the best part was BYOB. The staff was so accommodating and the food was so succulent that I'm speechless. Now this is the place to go if you are visiting, I would definitely come back when I'm in town. The ambiance was very casual and cozy.Down to the food....- Almond Stuffed Dates (4 stars): It was really tasty, the bacon definitely helped- Braised Pork Shank (5 stars): Omg to die for! The pork was perfectly cooked and the meat was so tender, great flavor- Amsterdam Style Mussels (5 stars): what a great portion and very well seasoned. The mussels were cooked right, wasn't dry at all- Milk Poached Sturgeon (10 stars): Now this would be my last meal on earth. The fish was amazing and man the creamed corn went so well with it. And the Salsa verde was omg....Can I get this delivered to SF?- Handmade Fettucine with Duck Sausage (4 stars): the pasta dish was really good, I like it when the noodle is al dente. The night ended with some kind of bread pudding dessert shaped like a slice of pie. Another OMG, not too sweet just perfection. Can I get a what what...."
"Went back for another prix fixe meal last night.  I think I enjoyed the meal more this time and the service was really friendly and helpful even though one of my dining partners was about 30 min late. Appetizers were the sausage roll, the perioge (sp) and the pate.  All were OK but nothing special.  For entrees I got the trout which was awesome!  The flavors with it and all of the sides went really well and added some different flavors in each bite.  The other two got the special burger which I was really unimpressed with.  But, they were HUGE! I think like close to a pound!  I just didn't think that the flavor was all that great and there was no way the toppings could overpower the massive burger.  Also there was no pink in the burger.  The truffle fries were great though. All of the desserts (pineapple bread pudding, chocolate bars and strawberry walnut crisp) were awesome.I stand by my thought that it was really good but I wouldn't pay full price for it.  The 3 course meal on Wednesday is the way to go!"
"The food was very good and the service was great. No beer or wine on the menu, but can bring your own. I didn't but the staff was heading down to the local wine shop and they brought me back a perfect beer to accompany my over the top good burger."
"ANY place that could take the day I was having last week and turn me from a grump to one happy camper gets 5 stars in my book! HB Restaurant was the location for January's Yelp GNO and what a location it was. From the moment I walked in, a little harried, late and in definite need of a cocktail- this place (and our waiter) charmed me. I loved the walls painted with whimsical sayings and covered with oversized mirrors. I loved the charm of the large table areas that they put together for us. I loved that it was BYOB and I had brought one of my favorites to the party.  And the lighting? I think I need it for my house as we all looked fabulous (but that's not hard to do when it's GNO and we ladies are lovely!) As I scrambled in my seat, our server took my bottle of champagne , opened it in the back and made sure we had enough flutes to go around. I was just starting to relax when the first course arrived. Of the three I sampled- two will bring me back: the bacon wrapped sugar encrusted almonds and the artichoke and Edam fritters. As I write this- I am already craving a return visit to HB to get me some more of these treats. After a little salad intermission- our entrees began to arrive. I had chosen the mushroom risotto which was delicious and creamy and quite a large portion. And then the parade of desserts came out. Now while I could only eat one of them given an aversion to citrus, the mini bundt cake with the whipped cream was enough for me (although the orange creamscicle mousse almost made made tempt fate!) Our server made my night by telling me I was ""channeling such positive energy"" (he should have seen me just an hour prior!) my table mates were delightful (a special shout out to Colleen and Amanda who squeezed me in at the end of the table) and the chef coming out to say hi was the icing on the cake. You can bet I will be back. And while I can't imagine it could get any better- I just wonder how great it will be when HB doesn't have to do the heavy lifting of turning a bad work day into a wonderful evening! I'm thinking Nirvana!"
"Due to a laaaate kickball night (and a walk past GT fish and oyster) I had been craving fried oysters.  (which is noteworthy considering that until my 20s, I hated seafood in any form - this was my first yen for oysters-and a block before GT I had been craving strawberries...mental note: shots of peppermint schnapps make me sound pregnant).  So, imagine my happydance surprise that the restaurant my date and I settled on had them!  And these weren't just oysters, they were oysters on top of some ridiculously tasty, slightly spicy grits.  Supergrits. I could have gone home happy right there...except I was on a date, and it happened to be going rather well. Then throw in some tangy gazpacho, lamb's belly (with buttermilk creme fraiche and green tomato relish  - a really choice combination), a gumbo inspired venison sausage and shrimp stew and top it off with bacon chocolate and a BYOB bottle of sparkling wine and this girl wanted to stay up all night tasting and being charmed by everything in front of her."
It was love it first sight!!!  Great work Y'all!!!
"To die for.  Seriously.It's rare when I eat any more than 1/2 of anything served at a dinner, but not here.  I suggest wearing your 'eating pants' because it's that good.  I usually start with the bacon wrapped dates, which I didn't even know could melt in your mouth until I came here.  I've also had the risotto as a starter and I've never tasted peas so perfectly cooked.  The pastas are home made and desserts are incredible.  Do not leave without having something for dessert!The food and service are both outstanding.  Every bite tastes different and better than the last, plus it's BYOB."
"There can not bee enough praise for this wonderful little restaurant. Not only does it sit in a charming neighborhood where it is fun to walk (in River North). But the food is excellent, too and the owner & his crew are warm and knowledgeable people with real passion for what they are doing! We had calamaris salad as an appetizer with an amazing dressing & fresh bread.My husband had duck and was very, very happy with it. I ate a trout which was on the point. It came accompanied by a cold kefir sauce and a chickpea and asparagus medley. Soooo gooood.The desserts, I have to admit were delicious but just too huge.Both of us felt full for five days after the desserts.Please consider sharing a desert with two or even three people!!!The owner told us that he is of dutch decent and spent a lot of time in Holland - maybe this explains how they manage to have these high standards of fish and seafood. But they also have good options for vegetarians.I certainly had one of the best meals ever at HB!If I would live in Chicago I would go there ALL the time!PS: It is BYO & one block from it is a charming wine place called ""Kafka"" which helps you out :)"
"Its been early June since my husband and our nieces visited this place and it was lovely.  The owner and his staff were so nice, I mean genuinely nice.  Every water glass filled, every question answered so we understood, and suggestions on food spot on.One note - They are the perfect restaurant if you want great food before a Blue Man Group performance which is a short distance away.Their menu changes so some of this may not be available now.Beef Cheek with Cheese Grits - I ordered this.  It's basically a beef roast that has a little more fat in it allowing for lots of flavor.  I loved it and the grits underneath melted in my mouth.  A huge hit.Pistacio Scallops - My husband ordered this and he thought it was average with little flavor.  It was the special and he didn't go with any of what the waiter had gotten done telling us were the most popular dishes.  If he tried the chef's experiment and it wasn't good, then it was my husband's problem.  Bravo to the chef for experimenting with different flavors.Fish Dishes - I can't remember what my niece ordered,  I believe it was a trout dish, but not on the menu.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of their fish recipes....all of them were said to be popular orders by the waiter and my niece who is a Pescatarian loved it.Spagetti Bolonese - Not good.  My other 18 year-old non experimental neice tried this and didn't like it.  Too much meat and not enough thick sauce.  I appreciate the chef putting something kind of normal on the menu for people like her, but for an american restaurant with a dutch influence I think they may want to stay away from Italian references; they'll just not be able to compare theselves to the everyday (boring) Italian places in the city.Atmosphere = Warm and friendly"
"A superb little bistro. The restaurant itself isn't very big and can get pretty busy, but the atmosphere and decor are really great. Very old skool and intimate. The staff is super friendly, and it's BYOB. The food is really great. Some of the stuff on the menu feels a bit southern-inspired, and perhaps along that theme are actually quite salty. For instance, the fried oyster in its batter is very salty by itself, but it comes on a bed of cream cheese grits and vinegar that you eat the oyster with, and if you do it foils the salt. The food is very good, and everybody is so nice. The only thing is to call ahead or make a reservation; but even if you have to wait, the neighborhood is pretty fun to wander around in, or just go up a few blocks to Kafka to get a nice bottle of wine."
"HB use to be my favorite go-to restaurant in Boystown and I have recommended it to friends for years...not anymore.  Our meals last night were VERY disappointing.  The cheese board use to be one of my favorite appetizers to share.   There was barely enough for one person for $17. The Caesar salad a baby beets salad were very good, but pricey.  The bouillabaisse special was basically only mussels (3 shrimp 2 clams) and for $28 we felt ripped off, because the mussels on the dinner menu were only $19.  My Lamb breast was meager and the side that came with it was not good.  The chicken special was just a small chicken breast and nothing special for $24. The service is still impeccable,  but come on, please go back to what you use to be, a great food experience.  After leaving a good tip for the service and not having any dessert we paid $55 each for a BYOB restaurant."
"Fine dining with Miss Holly. At HB, everything was good, but not great. I liked the Wednesday prix fixe Wednesday deal. That was sweet. To start, I had a smoked trout appetizer. I didn't care for the trout-y paste, to be honest. My gnocchi for dinner was OK. My dessert was a sort of pecan pie that was too too sweet. Now, Holly's meal was better than mine. But even with her, there was the odd, bigger-than-your-head Caesar's salad. That thing was so big, I asked the salad if he wanted me to pull up a chair for him.It is a small place, but wow, it was really loud in there. Our waitress was very nice.I'm not aching to be contrary here because I see all the glowing reviews, but to me, HB was the very definition of 3 yelp-stars: worth visiting, but just OK. yow, bill"
"Amazing food, great service, wonderful location!Celebrated a birthday there and this was the perfect location for an intimate dinner. The place can get loud (largely depending on your neighbors :-)), but the food, service and ambience made up for it.Food was one of the best I've ever had and I certainly am not lacking in picky! :-)Highly recommend it!"
"5 Stars for HB.  HB is the perfect combination of food, service, and ambiance.  The restaurant is small, quaint and quirky (look for the photo of the man in shower with the tattoos in the bathroom).  As for the service, you can tell that the entire staff cares about what they are serving and how they are serving it.  After leaving the restaurant, I felt like I personally knew everyone there.  They were attentive without being overbearing, thoroughly knew what they were talking about, and genuinely wondered what we thought of the food.Speaking of the food, every dish was better than the rest.  Here's what we had:Almond stuffed dates (wrapped with bacon and baked with brown sugar):  I'm a vegetarian but was told they tasted even better than they smelled, and lived up to the ones at Avec.Watercress on Skordalia (radishes, red onion, crumbled egg, toasted pumpkin seeds, and pink peppercorn vinegarette):  well-balanced, fresh, and perfect amount of dressingMussels (beef broth, anise, dried basil, garlic, truffle fries):  the plumpest mussels I have ever had - so tasty you didn't need the broth (although tasty, was not the best we've ever tasted)Braised Beef Cheek (weisenberger mills cheese grits, ""henry bain"" sauce, jus, charred cippolini salsa verde):  amazingSautéed Whitefish (fava bean puree, curried okra, and malt vinegar reduction):  perfectly crispy skin, and I will never have another puree againOxtail Ragu:  perfectly cooked pasta and noted by the orderer as the best dish of the night!House made Belgian Chocolate Candy Bars with coconut and cayenne:  so great and the restaurant gave us more to take homeThe only thing the restaurant must work on is the bread they bring out in the beginning - its cold foccaccia that's a little dry (accompanied by an amazing balsamic reduction though). I would recommend outsourcing from a nearby café for some nice baguettes."
"In love with this place. The mussels are so wonderful. I have been craving them for a few weeks now!! Plus, it's BYOB!!"
"After talking with the manager via Yelp I've decided to pull my previous review and update HB with an attempt to be a little more constructive.First, let me say that I know my experience is not the norm and from what my friends have said it was far from it.  But I was not overly impressed with the food at HB.  We did go on a Pre-Fixe night so take our review with that in mind.  And in the end, we saw some disturbing things with regards to service.STARTERS:  Crab Bisque was good, interesting, and surprisingly light.  Mushroom Strudel was good on the mushroom side, but the ricotta did not go well with the mushroom, nor was it mixed well.  We ended up with a mushroom side and a ricotta side and the ricotta was just too much by itself and there were not enough mushrooms to prevent the ricotta from being overpowering.  Pear & Arugula salad was standard.DINNER:  The Haddock was a good standard dish, but uninspired.  It lacked anything that separated this dish from any other fish dish I've had.  That being said, maybe my expectations were too high here.  The Chickpea Fritter with the Haddock was horrible in multiple ways from consistancy to taste.  After speaking with the manager he acknowledged an issue and has said that this has been remedied.  The other dish we had was a Homemade Sausage Special with Molasses.  The Molasses was weak in flavor and runny.  The sausage did not hold an interesting flavor on its own and we took it home to put on a skillet the next morning.  The grits served with the sausage I thought were okay... which is bad news because I hate grits.  My fiance said they tasted like they were from a box, which I admit is my basis for comparison since she is a grit expert in comparison to myself.DESSERT:  I'm not sure if our server did a poor job explaining this dish to us or not.  What we got was this frozen chocolate cake thing, which must have been rushed because it tasted and looked like something you get out of a store with just a little extra plating.  It wasn't bad though.SERVICE:  The bus boy was awesome and provided us with our best service we got here, but this is were things got appalling for us.  We were barely visited by our waiter.  Considering how busy the night was and the speed in which our food came out this was unacceptable.  A couple of kind words go along way to letting us know we still matter.  But what really sent us over the edge was when the manager pushed a two-top into another table that a couple was still dining at, to make room for a party of 4 still waiting to be seated.  Let me say this again - THE MANAGER PUSHED A TABLE INTO THE TABLE OF ANOTHER COUPLE WHO WAS STILL DINNING TO PREP THEIR TABLE THAT THEY WERE EATING AT FOR A PARTY WHO WAS NOT BEING SEATED YET.  Even the people who I know, who loved HB could not imagine this level of disrespect in any restaurant.EXTRAS:  My talks with the manager on yelp were both good and bad.  Overall this place needs to learn to deal with the rush.  The manager first tried to blame us for our bad dinning experience because we intimidated him and he was too scared to appoach us.  But later he had the humility to back up and say he was honestly overwhelmed with the number of people coming in and out of their establishment.  He has said they are working to correct the issue and I really hope they do... and if they do, I'll give them another shot potentially.In the mean time - 2 stars because my previous review used the work ""meh"" which is the yelp definition for 2 stars.RECOMMENDATION:  Don't go on a Wednesday.  Man up the extra bucks and hopefully you will get some better service than we did... and from what I've heard - better food too."
"The Sturgeon was Insane Amazing,  best fish dish in the city!!The usuals are still on the new menu but there was nothing to steer clear of.  EVERYTHING was perfect!!  Go HERE, YOU CAN NOT GO WRONG.  Reservations are a must, the Secret is out on this Gem."
"Great food,reasonable prices, intimately small place for a date.Food:4/5atmosphere:4.5/5decor:4/5service:4/5Here's what my bf and I ordered:ALMOND STUFFED DATES as an appetizerDUCK and CORIANDER CRUSTED SALMONthe stuffed dates were ok but not as much as I expected since lots of yelpers raved about them. It was too sweet for an appetizer ( and I have sweet tooth)I didn't taste the duck but bf said it was good but not the best. I think he said that because he thought he ordered the lamb but for some reason the duck slipped out of his mouth when ordering and didn't notice until he got what he thought he had ordered.The salmon was really good. There was no fishy smell as I always get when i have the salmon. It was a perfect harmony with the quinoa tabouleh that came with the dish.Overall:Great small place with a intimate atmosphere. I would go HB again with my bf for sure and we don't usually go somewhere we've already been but this deserves our second visit."
"Last week I had the opportunity to visit Home Bistro -HB on a Wednesday night.  I mention Wednesday because that is their prix fix night.  Star Wednesdays on your calendar because this is a great deal.  Start with the bacon wrapped dates.  Yea, I know, there are other interesting things on the menu. Forgettaboutit! Just remember dates.  Not having the benefit of this insightful review, I had the fried oysters on grits.  And they were good, but not as good as the ....you know.  The cheese board was also a winner. (BTW there are no losers.) Cesar salad was good made great when I asked for a received anchovies on top. I had Italian sausage peppers and clams and was surprised and delighted with this entree. The mussels were great and after getting over the name, the smoked hog jowl on seven grain bread was delicious. Now please sit down for the surprise.  $30  Yup, three course meal of this quality for three Hamiltons!  And it's a BYOB so you can only blame yourself for the wine, or in the case of the table next to us, for the vodka!  Service was friendly, attentive and perfect.  They even picked up on the fact that I was from New Jersey.  Oh, and the photos in the bathroom are taken by the owner and are almost as good as the food."
"The atmosphere was really nice, but the food was at times over-salted...sadly, the dessert left something to be desired as well (basically sheets of chocolate). I really wanted to love it more and therefor plan to go again and give it another shot.  What I tried: - artichoke and edam fritters (a little too salty and gooey for my taste. i had to ask, what is this again?  if it's so far from food, is it even worth eating?- sauteed garlic and escargot - this was my favorite- summer salad, i like spice, but the spiced walnuts were really spicy.- braised oxtail and ricotta gnocchi  - this was another favoriteamong a few other items. I would definitely go back and try other interesting menu items, that we simple didn't get to: - almond stuffed dates- pierogi- bbq beef tongueAs others suggested, I did grab a wine from Kafka's across the street and it was fabulous....so thanks for that."
"Just freakin' fantastic. The food was everything you would hope for at the price your paying. And BYOB! Four of us went and we were sat right in the window. It was the Saturday before the pride parade, so the people watching was out of control! Truly dinner and a show. That was great of course but the food was really the star here. I got one of specials which was pork cheek on top of grits in a sauce that escapes my mind at the moment. It was bad-ass to put it in layman's terms. The pork was tender, juicy, and full of flavor. The grits underneath were creamy and supported the pork cheek perfectly. It had flavors on top of flavors a real character in a meal. I also tried the mussels with truffle oil fries. These were like crack. The mussels were tender and juicy. They had a black licorice hint in the back which made them very unique. And the fries were just otherworldly. If people want to study the perfection of the fried potato they need to talk to these people. We finished it all off with two desserts the bread pudding (decadent and rich) and a brownie topped with cream (as far as brownies go this one could take your grandma's recipe for a ride.) Now I would have loved to give this place 5 stars the food certainly deserved it. The service was just not on par for this type of restaurant. We sat in a pretty empty restaurant with our menus for a while. Our waiter got our appetizer order and disappeared. Our appetizer (which was a chartreuse plate and a artichoke and edam fritters: AMAZING AS WELL) was brought out by someone else and we sat with our menus and ate our appetizers. Not till long after our first course was done that our waiter reappeared and took our dinner order. This continued through the rest of the meal. It wasn't bad service just not great and for the price tag it should have been much better. But please don't let that deter you from going here. This is a one of a kind place and worth a visit!! You will be happy you did."
"My husband and I were kind of at odds about where to go for Valentine's Day. We wanted to go somewhere new, but we wanted a good meal as well. We had wanted to try HB for awhile, so I made a res and off we went. Cute/dark/romantical little place. It's also BYOB, so we brought a bottle of Delirium Noctournm and Prankqster beer. It's sort of a fusion of New American Food and Dutch food, and both of those please me.We had been to Amsterdam/Brussels earlier this year and we had a great time and a lot of great food experiences and I was really hoping HB could match what we had in Europe.We started out with the Escargot / Edam and Artichoke Fritters with garlic aioli and both were super tasty. The fritters were really rich (deep fried, crispy outside with a mild, creamy inside) and the aioli was super garlicky. I loved it, but any more than that small portion would have been too much. It was VERY rich.For main courses, I ordered mussels (""Amsterdam Style"") that came with truffle frites with more garlic aioli. My husband ordered a lamb stew with beans and other goodies. Now, here's were I am debating how to rate the mussels. I have been to the CAPITAL OF THE MUSSEL WORLD, Brussels. Nothing can compare to those. Those are far and away the most delicious mussels I've ever had. The mussels that HB served were quite different from that (heavy handed on the anise), but still good. They weren't as good as the ones I had in Europe, but I'm not sure that's a fair comparison to make. That's how I feel about that. The frites were off the charts delicious.My husband liked his stew, as well.For dessert we ordered a caramel cheesecake with homemade whipped cream and pecans. My husband was skeptical since he finds cheesecake to be too rich at times, but this WAS THE BEST CHEESECAKE I HAVE EVER HAD. I had such a unique flavor and the light whipped cream cut the richness of the cheesecake. It was sweet and delicious, but light at the same time.Our waitress was awesome and did a wonderful job, to top things off.The bill was reasonable and we would both go back to try other things on the menu. Yay for HB!"
"I've come here twice and HB has delivered both times. The menu tends to change frequently, but the gnocchi, pork special, and mussels stood out in the dishes we ordered. The advocaat has gotten some press as one of the most interesting deserts in the country and is definitely unique. Ordering it will usually prompt the appearance of the chef in the dining area, where he'll tell you all about his preference of kosher salt to sea salt's pretentiousness and regal you with exotic tales of the Netherlands."
"There are tons of great restaurants in Chicago.  But for me, beyond good food, they have to have personality.  HB stole my heart immediately.YES, the food is unique and delicious, and YES it's a BYO, which is always a plus, but being greeted at the door by the owner, chatting with him while he fills our waters, and departing with a hug on our first visit---  THAT'S why we'll return.  We already feel at home.Next time we'll take the late reservations and bring two bottles of wine so we can share until closing."
"This is my absolute favorite restaurant of all time - it's a bold statement, but I stand by it 100%.  Perhaps I should knock all of my other 5 star reviews down a star because ""Woohoo! As good as it gets!"" truly only applies to HB restaurant.  (sometimes I wonder if I should get money from them for advertising - i dont think a single friend of mine hasn't heard me gushing over this place)I've been here only on wednesdays up to this point - but the food is well worth the money even on a normal day.  They do an amazing prix fixe 3 course meal for $30 (from the whole menu) - you will leave stuffed and blissfully happy!  The menu is always rotating - so it keeps you wanting to come back for more and more and more.The service is excellent - everyone is extremely down to earth, the ambiance is cozy.  Added bonus - it's byob - no cork fee.the best gnocchi i've ever eaten was here, their meat selections are always extremely tender and delicious, and i've had many sides on my plate that i'd never have tried in other circumstances but knew that here they'd be good no matter what.  Come to think of it, i think many of the dishes i've had here are some of the best i've ever eaten.  enough of this review, get up and go try this place out - you will not be disappointed.  i love you HB."
"For the longest time I had HB as a ""change my life"" restaurant. I use to live in Lakeview and it was by far our favorite restaurant in the area. I've been to HB a bunch of times, for all kinds of occasions, mostly with my fiance or friends. Always better to make reservations  The dates are fantastic, the pork is amazing and pretty much everything you eat will blow your mindI'll tell you the only reason they lost me as their biggest fan is service speed. And this might have been a particularly slow Tuesday night, but in my last experience our food took over 1hr..  for appetizers. We were 3/4 done with our bottle of wine before we had any food.. and we were starving. So if you are patient, and want to eat one of the best meals of your life.. HB is your place"
"My friends and I went back to HB for a final dinner at HB before I headed back to school. I had such a great time the last time I went so I convinced my friends to go back :) We had the BEST TIME!  Like I said before, the staff (Joncarl was waiting on people) are amazingly friendly and funny. Joncarl really makes the restaurant atmosphere comfortable yet classy at the same time. I also like the music choices in the background too. I ordered the steak frites (again) and like the last time, it was awesome. It was cooked perfectly and the truffle fries are simply fantastic. My one friend also ordered the steak and she loved it. My other friend had the duck sausage and she loved that too. I didn't taste any of it but it looked really good!  I love how there is no corkage fee for the wine and beer.  I seriously think HB is the best restaurant in the Lakeview area and top 5 for all of Chicago. I highly recommend this restaurant! btw- you have to leave a message to make reservations but they always call you the same day later in the night."
"Man oh man.Somewhat overrated.I'm gonna try to sound smart for the next 20 seconds.  (but that's all I can muster... oh.. and I said, ""try"")*Ahem*  In statistics and in medicine we have this concept of ""Pretest Probability"" - which is the likelihood of having a disease even before you perform a confirmatory test.  For example, if I see someone with say...oh I dunno... A SWORD THROUGH THEIR ABDOMEN.... I have a fairly high pretest probability that they injured something, probably severely, inside their abdomen even before I get a confirmatory CT scan. Apply this concept to Home Bistro restaurant and I had a HIGH pretest probability that everything would be great even before I did my confirmatory test of...the food hitting my stomach.  This was based on:1) Unique Menu2) Dutch chef3) BYOB4) infamous MUSSELS5) raved about on YELP I'll hit the high points first.  The restaurant is cozy and small, very warm and great ambiance.  Very HOMEY and BISTRO-Y, if that hasn't been used yet :)We got by without reservations on a friday by showing up to eat at 5:30 which is a good tip, otherwise no free tables until 9:45 pmLast great thing is BYOB, as advertised HEAVILY.  I'll get into this later.We ordered a lot and honestly I was just disappointed by the taste of the food.  There seemed to be a trend towards heavy, rich and salty in the menu so be aware of that. 1. artichoke fritters - dense, thick, salty, with a side of equally salty garlic aioli (which reminded me of the garlic sauces in LA, see my Zankou Chicken review)2. Almond stuffed dates -  tasty, yes, but small.  Served in a small tray there were 8 peanut sized bacon wrapped brown sugar dates on toothpicks.  overpriced, which was a trend3. Crispy Veal Sweetbreads - sooooo dissappointing, this was the first time I was let down by thyroid and/or pancreatic tissue!! Ok, well maybe I've had a string of good luck up to this (see Schwa review).  But first off I claim false advertising because they weren't crispy.  Fried, yes - but soggy and fried.  The sweetbreads were very chewy and the accompanying sauces and hummus were rich and salty and did not enhance anything4. Mussels - oh the let downs would not end in this meal!  I have heard great things about the HB Mussels + truffle fries.  I was surprised they weren't an appetizer but I wanted them so I ordered them anyways.  At nearly 20 dollars very pricey for any mussels I've had anywhere.  Can't be the truffle fries because I can get those at Big and Littles for $3.50.  Flavor just didn't do it for me.  The anise was very strong, and overwhelming, and most offensive was the salt attack again which was pretty heavy handed and (I'm bragging a bit here)  I have a pretty high tolerance for salt.  The BROTH which if anyone who's had mussels knows that a good mussel dish will have you sopping up the broth with any bread you can find in the restaurant or have you drinking it straight up - not so much here..5. Trout, Short Ribs, Pork Knuckle Pappardelle - All Rich and Salty6.  Bread pudding - VERY GOOD actually7. Apple crisp - NOT very goodLooking back, I realize that French food (maybe Dutch food too, though I wouldn't know) tends to be rich and salty.  BE SURE TO BRING PLENTY OF WINE BECAUSE YOU WILL NEED IT. Rating based on so many disappointments among the many we tried, obviously there is much more to the menu.Honestly, I think this place is so successful because it is BYOB, and I think the menu pricing factors that convenience into account because everything seems to be 25% more that I think it should be.  The $30 wed pre fixe which seems more reasonable.Oh, and my stomach confirmed this all. But clearly a lot of yelpers still like this place so it's worth another shot."
"Everything about this place is fun and wonderful. Intimate and cozy, perfect for a date! The food is fresh, innovative and delicious. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The rainbow trout...amazing! And, its BYOB. Can't get much better than that!"
"Must say that the service here was great, and everyone was incredibly nice. Love the BYOB too. Fried oysters over grits were tasty and the best part of the meal. But overall, the food was very hit or miss and it went downhill from there.All of our entrees were on the salty side and could have used less salt, but the lamb belly dish I got was EXCEPTIONALLY salty. Salty to the point of nearly being inedible. And this is coming from someone who likes very flavorful food. Who knows, it could have been a really off dish or an off night, but I'd advise one and all to steer clear of the lamb belly. Someone else at my table got a pork chop special that -- while also generously salted -- was much tastier."
"This place is amazing!!!I have been here twice, but as my favorite restaurant, I will definitely be back many, many times. My most recent visit, last week, solidified HB as one of the best run restaurants in Chicago. We arrived about 10 minutes prior to our reservation time, and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes for our table. I honestly did not mind though, since I was so excited to eat there. The manager apologized to us multiple times AND gave us a sample of the bacon wrapped dates (not my thing, but my boyfriend can't stop talking about how amazing they were) and gave us free desert at the end of the night. The wait staff is so friendly, and the food is amazing. The atmosphere in the restaurant is great for a date night, and BYOB makes this place all the better. My personal favorite dish: the gnocchi, it is the best I have ever had. I advise everyone to try HB!"
"Ambiance is great as is service. Byob. However, food has gone downhill. The lamb breast was overlooked and the spinach fettuccine was oddly sweet. Fried cheese app was good but a bit cold, Caesar was salty. I gave this place a five when I first came and it honestly has gone significantly downhill. Sad."
"We thought we were going to Hearty Boys, and as it turns out, one of the actual Hearty Boys did sell this restaurant to a former employee but apparently with no supervision or follow up. Now that we have also gone to the real Hearty Boys up on Broadway, it's not even fair to compare.  We had an out of town guest and were so exited to take them to HB Restaurant. Once there we were kind of embarrassed that we had ""over sold"" the place to our guest... I didn't think the food was all that great, and the service was nothing short of weird. I literally could not catch the attention of our server and went the whole meal needing a refill on my drink (!)I did see the only two servers that were there in the kitchen doorway but they were too busy chatting with each other and even waving my arms didn't catch their attention. I think I should give two stars but I'm trying to take into account whatever issues they must have been having that night which led to a fairly disappointing experience. This is the only place where bacon wrapped dates were NOT good... how do you even mess that up?! I think they would do well to change the name and stand on their own two feet to avoid this type of confusion. I could have been happier I suppose if I was NOT expecting a Hearty Boys experience.  :(  The owners must have been off that night because others seem to have given more positive comments and I wish that I could too."
"Came here without a reservation.  Unfortunately, they were full when we walked in.  The host informed us to come back a little later, so we went down the street for a drink.  When we returned, the place was packed.  Food: We started with the Lamb Sweetbreads.  They had a great combination of sweet and salty flavors.  The texture was great, with the soft sweetbreads and hard nuts.  We then had the butternut squash soup with shrimp.  It was so fantastic.  The soup had just enough body, with richness and interesting flavors throughout.  It went great with our wine.  For entrees, we had mussels and trout.  The trout was delicate and tasty.  My only gripe was with the Mussels entree.  I felt like they should make it an appetizer with about 1/5 the portion size.  They were good, but I got bored after eating like 40 of them. Drinks: BYOB. Praise JesusAtmosphere: Cute and romantic.Service: Friendly and fast.Prices: Fair for the quality of food and BYOB factor.Overall: I will definitely be back."
"I'd heard many good things about HB and was interested in seeing if a BYOB could live up to the hype. Answer-- YES. Chicken liver pâté was great. Italian sausage, clams, peppers was unique and delicious. Salmon was good but not outstanding.the butter cake with almonds and cherries was out of control. Our waitress was really good too! Delicious. Great BYOB restaurants in Chicago are tricky to find. Don't miss this one."
"I had been looking forward to coming to HB for awhile, mainly because I knew it would be a great deal with the BYOB. We had early reservations since I tend to decide near the last minute where I like to go.We had the almond stuffed dates (wrapped in bacon!) which came out quickly once we ordered. I was tempted by the fish of the day and my friend had the lamb. Both dishes were fabulous tasting but there was so much that we both took almost half of the meal home (perhaps we were eating too early...) but still decided to order dessert in celebration of my birthday. We had a cheesecake which was good but not the best I've had.The food is great here, and you can't beat the BYOB - my only issue was that we were stuck at a tiny table for two that seemed to be in the way of all the people who were passing. I also had to find a place to put my coat and purse on the back of my chair so every time someone walked by it would bump everything up against me. I've decided to overlook this because food and service was stellar - we felt very welcomed and noticed a variety of couples all over the restaurant."
"My big bro and I needed to catch up after a couple weeks. We weren't hungry -- well, too hungry -- but felt like a good meal without too much fuss. We settled on HB, my first time here in its current incarnation (I remember going to a restaurant that was once here).First problem: it's BYO and we didn't BY-anything. So he went to find what was suitable from the 7-11 across the street. Meanwhile, I studied the menu. Everything looked amazing, but honestly we couldn't get past apps. We literally had three orders of mussels and fries. They were just that good. The mussels are prepared in a butter saus that, when dipped with bread, made my toes curl with delight.The staff was attentive and we were never without someone stopping by every once in a while. It wasn't the kind of helicoptering some servers do, but more of the auntie variety. On a Wednesday night, we had the place pretty much to ourselves.About $100 later, we were allowed to leave. Def not the cheapest meal for a handful of apps, but the ambiance and tastes were well worth it. I hope to actually have a meal next time."
"Wednesday night 3 courses (the whole friggin' menu!) for $30 to the tune of ""Friday I'm in Love"" (but not the whole friggin' song!)Mussels, how you fall apartMushroom strudel melts my heartBYOB doesn't even startCuz Wednesday, I'm in loveTruffle fries, yayReserve a table for your favorite dateWednesday never hesitate...Crisp fried oysters, a lovely snackGuess I'll have an HB heart attackBoystown never looking backCuz Wednesday I'm in loveEnjoy the dip and focaccia breadThis place is as good as I've readI know that I will be well fedCuz Wednesday I'm in loveService up to the ninesIt's a wonderful surpriseGood times and how time fliesNight out on the townCheck out the ruby red troutAnd sauces so rich and lightYour head will spin round and roundClose your eyes and take a biteIt's such a gorgeous sightAwesome eats in the middle of the nightCan never get enoughEnough of this stuffIt's WednesdayI'm in loveSour cherry bread pudding is super goodPanna Cotta with custard, I heart you, tooDesserts and coffee always ring trueCuz Wednesday I'm in love"
"Truffle fries + garlic aioli here were C-R-A-C-K! Order a large bowl to share with the table because these little fries disappear quickly! Those fries were really 5 stars haha..droolBYOB! yay! My paparadelle dish was less than stellar because the braised pork was a bit tough, and the noodles kinda stuck together. Wouldn't order this again.Bread pudding with that thicker whipped cream was heavenly!! loveee it!I'd definitely come back to try some of the other dishes."
This is a cute bistro with a wonderful palate of foods and flavors.  Prepare to be warmly greeted upon arrival and treated very well.  Warm friendly atmosphere intimate dining area nestled on a street of fun shops.  They are also b.y.o.b. so bring what you like to pair with fantastic gourmet plates.
"Our narcoleptic at the table hit a wall, so the staff naturally helped reposition her in order to more comfortably snooze. Another one of us violently shattered a glass, and they just smiled. Nope, nothing fazes Home Bistro. It's the lovely antithesis of an asshole and the world can use more of those. Remixed comfort food is done right by the mussels w damn good truffle fries,  tender-as-the-night lamb shoulder with cornbread and melty short rib. The fluke tastes much more appetizing then it smells and even the tricky sautéed escargot comes off without a hitch. And when the curiously reasonable check arrives, you almost feel like you've gotten away with vehicular birdslaughter or some other third degree crime.Dining at HB is sort of like eating in a hip womb with an enviable playlist. From the minute you walk in to when you leave, it's your cozy and uplifting sanctuary from overzealous antique dealers, flat pop, war crimes, inexplicable moisture and anything else that puts a damper on your day."
Even though they usually have only one vegan option or vegetarian option that can be made vegan I love going there. The atmosphere and staff are always so pleasant and helpful in picking the best dish for you. Make sure you bring your own wine as it is a BYOB place.
"How does one write a review when the owners are dear friends from when we all lived in NYC?  Well here it goes - I think we found our new favorite place to eat but unfortunately it is 675 miles away from our hometown of Philadelphia.  So I live in Philly and work in NYC.  Yes I am a jaded east coaster - I thought we had the best places to eat in the country.  Well tonight I was proven wrong and it is hard for me to admit I am wrong (just ask seth).We started our meal with the BEEF PASTRAMI & POTATO SALAD followed by CRISP FRIED OYSTERS then as if that wasn't enough we had SAUTEED GARLIC & ESCARGOT and last but not least was the CHICKEN LIVER MOUSSE WITH SCHMELZ - Oops I almost forgot the ALMOND STUFFED DATES -  It is hard to say which was my favorite, but I must go with the dates - and I do not mean the 3 men I was sitting with.  We then decided that we needed to have dinner - LOL - I had the HANDMADE MINT FETTUCINE WITH DUCK SAUSAGE.  Seth and I both said it was the best dish we had had in a long time.  Our overall experience was incredible - I am not just saying this because Joncarl and Bob are our friends - It was amazing - The staff -  the decor and just the overall experience is one that everyone should have.The next time you are in Chicago HB should be at the top of the "" MUST DO"" list!"
"I've been here once.  I remember the food was pretty good, but the livliness of conversation during that brunch is what made me think this place was great.  I'm sure that it has to do with seeing people I haven't seen for a while when I ate there, but it was just an overall good time.Plus my fiance has way too fast a metabolism for her own good.... so when she's on empty I need to put something in her stomach quickly.  The waiter was quick to get us a scrambled egg to hold her over until the food was ready (a big plus)"
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  It's so cozy inside and the food is always delicious.  The menu changes daily and I have yet to be disappointed.  I recently went to Amsterdam and loved it and realized that HB was exactly the same as many cafes there....candlelit, cozy and you are never rushed. The owner and chef is from Amsterdam..go figure.It's small but they can accommodate groups however, I think it's best for a group of 4 or for a date.And, BYO...can't beat it."
"Get the salmon and dates!!  This place is awesome!  The service was stellar, food was incredible, and loved that it was BYOB.  Definitely will be back soon!"
This place is amazing.  It's my new favorite restaurant in Chicago.  And it's BYOB.  The Wednesday prix fixe meal is such a great deal and you get to try so much more.  Service and staff were so nice and accommodating.  Restaurant was nice and cozy.  The food was delicious.I had the mussels and ceased salad and almond stuffed dates.  Everything was delicious.  One of the best Caesar salads I've had.  Some friends ordered the pork shank and the gnocchi.  All delicious!  Would go there again in a heartbeat.
"Big fan of this place.  Yelpers had it right when they recommended the edam fritters and bacon dates, which also happened to be the cheapest starters on the menu, which was completely economical.  Got out of there full and satisfied for $51.  Also charming decor and friendly service"
Meh ! It's nothing to compare with spots like avec!
"This place was not worth the money. Neither my husband nor I liked any of the food we ordered, everything was mediocre at best. I read the other Yelp reviews and had high hopes, but we were completely disappointed. We asked the waitress for recommendations and she encouraged us to get the Rabbit and Spatzel and the Mussels Amsterdam, which we did. The Rabbit was just a pile of pasta and ripped meat doused in way too much mustard and the mussels were ordinary. I'm sorry HB Bistro, I know other people think you're amazing, but I think you can get similar interesting menu items with far better taste and value at Gemini Bistro, Jane's or Le Buchon."
"BYOB! Boys Town gem. Delicious food, cozy atmosphere and friendly service. Kafka is also conveniently located across the street so you can pick up a couple bottles of wine before dinner. A group of 7 of us made reservations for dinner on Friday night and everyone left satisfied. The appetizers were definitely the best part. I highly recommend the sauteed garlic escargot and almond stuffed dates. For the main course I recommend the coriander rubbed salmon which was served with asparagus and polenta. The guy at Kafka recommended a nice chilled Viognier that paired really well with the salmon.The wild boar and cranberry sausage had a nice little spicy kick. The lamb burger was delicious but it seemed like too much for a full meal. I recommend turning them into mini sliders and serving them as an appetizer. Overall the experience was pleasant. The portions and the prices were good. Definitely a great spot for a nice dinner with friends."
"I REEEEEEEEEEEALLY wanted to love this restaurant. I came with such high hopes because living in the suburbs its hard to go into the city just for dinner.The food was pretty good. The bacon wrapped dates were so good I regretted only ordering 1 plate. The pork shank was this huge caveman portion of meat that was amazingly tender but SUPER bland. I wanted to try something new so I ordered the sturgeon, sturgeon was delicious!The only thing that sort of dampered the meal was the service. Our waitress was really nice and friendly, she was not the problem. The problem was how sloooooooooooow our food came out. We were seated a little before 7, ordered at 7 but somehow didn't get our appetizer until past 7:30. Our waitress apologized and comped it. Considering the appetizer came out so late I assumed our entrees would be speedy. Wrong.Our entrees came out over half our later. My max is 1-2 glasses of wine during a meal but we were there for so long that I managed to finish 3 glasses. A long dinner was fine since there wasn't a show or anything we needed to catch but still...come on....tables that were there before we were seated were long gone before we finished our meal. **I want the the job as the person in the front. As we were leaving I saw that he had a bottle of prosecco up there. How awesome of a job is that?!"
"Whoa.  Seriously?  Seriously.I don't live here, but I've eaten quite a few meals in Chicago. This is, without an iota of doubt, one of the very best places that I've had dinner. We had a large group -- so large that it seemed we were taking up about 1/3 of the dining room, but the service staff handled everything (including the bunches of wine we BYO-ed) with grace and aplomb. Top notch service is wonderful, but it doesn't mean much if the quality isn't there in the food. HB brought it, though.  The apps included bacon-wrapped dates, which I pretty much always love, as well as these tender artichoke fritters. Fritters. Wow.  I'm a sucker for fried food a few times a month, but don't eat it much.  If I could eat these fritters closer to home though? That would be dangerous.  They were one of my favorite things I've eaten in months. What was exceptional, though, was the fact that even in comparison, both entrees (served family-style) that our tables ordered (one fish, one chicken), even exceeded the fritters.  Delectable. The fish was light but packed a flavorful punch. The chicken was tender and made me jealous, wishing I had any clue how to make chicken taste anything like it at home. Desserts were very good.  I have to admit that I was so full, it was hard to give them their fair chance given the lack of room left in my stomach.  I just had a nibble of each.  I must say, however, that I am very picky about bread pudding, and the texture of this one was quite good.  I'm also a little more curious to experiment with the combination of chocolate and sesame, too. I would return here in a heartbeat."
"My meal at HB was a MUCH anticipated meal.  My friend who currently lives in Taiwan wanted to take me there LAST year, for my birthday.  She was so excited about eating at HB because back in Taiwan, for the past year or so, she had been reading YELP reviews about the restaurant.  She was SOO excited, and got me excited too.  Well, our reservation was on the day of the Pride parade.  The restaurant had a plumming problem and no one could get through the pride parade to remedy it!  Sooo, early afternoon that day , we got a call CANCELING our reservations.  We were very sad, and had a mediocre meal to replace the HB meal. However, HB gave us gift certificates for our trouble.  How nice!!FFWD 1 year!  My friend is back in the states and we make reservations at HB again.  This time, we get in, and on a wednesday... which is PRIX FIX wednesday, or price fix, whatever.  So it's 30 bux for an appetizer, main dish, and dessert.  Awesome deal, because the gift certificate was for 30$! My friend got an EXCELLENT hamburger.  It was huge and had all kinds of goodies on it, including pickled green tomatoes and more things I can't remember.  It also was the special, so possibly when you go and ask for this excellent burger, they will say, ""Sorry charlie, that was a one time thing and now is not that time.""  Don't pout though, the other food was alright.We also got the almond stuffed dates in bacon.  I don't get the hub bub over these.  They were good, but tasted identical to the bacon wrapped dates at cafe babareeba and/or other places.  It's not like you can only get these at HB.  Even though there is no almond involved at other places, I didn't really taste the almond much.We also got a few other appetizers which I feel are not worth mentioning.I got the beef cheek for my main dish, and it was good.  It was not great. It was tender, but I was not surprised because it was braised beef cheek.  That is always tender, at least when I've had it.  Don't get me wrong though, it was tasty, and I probably ate more of it than I should have.My other favorite (second to the amazing hamburger) of the meal was the bread pudding.  That stuff was AWESOME (so awesome my voice just cracked).  Currants and berries molded into delicious bread pudding.  Love it!All in all, I approve of HB.  Might come back if someone suggests it.... but, I don't know if it was worth the long wait ;)"
"Yeah, another five-star update. What of it?HB has become one of the very few restaurants to which I return, time and time again, because the food and atmosphere is so completely lovely. (Generally, I rarely eat at a place more than once, especially if it is outside of my 'hood.)So, what's new that requires the update?Well, for starters, they are making their own mozzarella which is positively delightful. Served atop yellow tomatoes, cucumbers in a sesame vinaigrette, it's plainly marvelous.The duck? With andouille sausage? And golden beets? Well, this very dish may have swayed my love for the darling beaked birds as live creatures. I've tried duck before and never been terribly impressed, but HB's version with the sausage and beets is really magical. Y.U.M. Cooked to a tender and pink temperature, this duck melts in your mouth.The whole fish is a delightful burst of seafood in your mouth, and the mussels with frites always satisfy the deepest longing for shellfish.So today? Happy tummy. That's always the case when Joncarl is involved.As always, make reservations, as the space is quite tiny. And BYOB. But you knew that.So, I'll remind you: Go to HB. Eat and be happy. Life cannot possibly be anything but fabulous when you allow Joncarl and his staff to take care of you at HB. The love affair continues!"
"HB has a wonderful atmosphere and great food.  If you go on Wednesday nights, the specials are great prices as well.  However, any other night of the week, I find that it's just a little pricey for what you get.  The deep-fried bacon is a must-try!"
This place has the best fries in the city!!!
"Ate here with 3 other people. You need to make a reservation since it fills up quickly. They do sell liquor so you have to bring your own wine. We ordered the bacon wrapped dates, sweet breads and something else. All were very good. for the main course I ordered the special which was soft shelled crabs. it was ok, nothing special. For desert we ordered the pound cake and the bread pudding. The bread pudding was delicious but the pound cake was just pound cake, nothing more, nothing less.I would maybe try this place again however, as a visitor I would probably want to try something new first."
"A neighborhood gem.  I recommended the HB/fixed price idea my BYOB club, one year after having a wonderful experience there. One year later, one year better. We had a group of five people, so we took on five different dishes. No one left hungry or disappointed. The service was fantastic, never left with an empty glass or old plates. If I had to come up with one complaint (and it's really not a complaint,) it would be that the place does get loud when the restaurant is full. However, the intimacy of the restaurant, the comfort in the food and the warmth of the staff supercedes this all-too-minor criticism.I read on yelp that people have been irritated with the lack of availability for walk-ins. I can only defend this place by reminding those who fail to remember that HB is in the city of Chicago.  As with any of the best restaurants in a lively neighborhood, reservations are a given.  You should not fault a restaurant with your inability to plan ahead."
"Great little restaurant that I've walked past a hundred times but have never seemed to make my way in until recently. The ambiance is surprisingly noisy, so you may want to reconsider if you are looking for dinner by candlelight.  I've heard the menu is constantly changing (not sure how often) but I ultimately decided on the lamb shank - which was absolutely tender, delicious... and before you ask the server what ramps are, I'll tell you! They're onions! =) Our server was attentive but it did take some time to get the check. The place is also BYOB!"
"Phenomenal.The last time I was there, we had pan fried veal brain, mussels, smoked squab AND a blueberry bread pudding. Simple. Decadent. Delicious."
"My dinner at HB was one of my favorite dining experiences in Chicago so far. I cannot gush enough about the family-style menu they put together for us: salty-sweet bacon-wrapped dates, trout served whole, Edam cheese and artichoke fritters... does HB stand for Holy Beejezuz?Whatever it means, HB certainly stands for haute-but-accessible cuisine and outstanding service. The service in this tiny restaurant is impeccable. We took advantage of the BYOB... and by that I mean, we took ADVANTAGE of the BYOB. Our amiable server was never far away, pouring wine and champagne freely without even having to ask (she must have been warned about us).The meal was also timed perfectly, so when we were finished with one thing, there was always something else on its way before we could even put down our forks. I've rarely been so impressed with that kind of communication between the front and back of the house.The atmosphere would have been romantic had my comrades and I not taken over the back area with our antics. Though, even that maintained an air of class here at HB."
"I've been to HB twice, once for Yelp Restaurant Week and once on a Wednesday for their prix fixe special. The portions are always pretty large, and i love the candlelit unpretentious atmosphere. It's also BYOB. And the food is amazing! Definitely recommend (basically everything I've tried): artichoke and edam fritters (which come with a WONDERFUL roasted garlic aioli), sauteed garlic and escargot, ""Amsterdam"" style mussels.Their desserts rotate daily, I believe, but I tried the panna cotta, bread pudding, and apple crisp and they have my seal of approval.HB is a definitely must try!"
"We descended upon HB with empty bellies, untold stories and a satchel or two of Ice (don't make me explain). ""We"" were a crew of Yelp Community Managers from L.A. to Detroit, and we were ready for a company dinner. You can imagine we could be an intimidating crew, but not if you are the pros at HB.HB is in Boystown, and if you are not familiar with Chicago (as I was not) the name is descriptive as on either side of HB you can find gay bars and specialty shops. On the inside, HB shares the simplicity of a rustic farmhouse--candles in wax-covered wine bottles and wooden tables. I think I saw a painting of a rooster (or two), but that might have been the bottles of wine talking. It's a ""bring your own"" establishment, and we arrived with 17 bottles.Service was easy and impeccable, and they were well prepared to feed us. Soon after sitting the feast commenced. I love out-of-this-world starters because it gets your belly happy in anticipation for every course. Artichoke fritters and bacon-wrapped dates were definitely cosmic! Any doubt I may have had regarding power of bacon fat was eliminated by the perfect combination of the fatty, juicy bacon with sweet dates served piping hot. The main course included whole fish and a chicken platter with cous cous. The ideal charred flavor infused the fish. The chicken was moist and seasoned in a smart contrast to the cous cous. Desserts were definitely prepared with skill and love, and they had a surprising savoriness instead of strong sweetness. I had mixed feelings about this.But, I have no mixed feelings about the overall experience at HB!"
"So a friend and I decided that we'd try another new BYOB this summer, so we I began at random just looking on the net, and found some dude's list of BYOB's that he had been to that he really liked.  HB just happened to be on there.  I was shocked to know that it was so close to me, as I live in Lakeview and had never noticed this place -- no wonder, it is extremely small. . . .which I really liked.  If you go, I strongly suggest that you make a reservation before you go.  I'd say it was a very intimate atmosphere.  We began by talking to the waiter and hearing about specials and what he recommended. Come to find out the same owner is currenlty building a new restaurant -- same type of food -- up north in Andersonville. After eating at HB, I will DEFINITLEY be trying out the new restaurant which will be called Vintage.My friend and I generally splite appetizers, but with all the mouth-watering, tempting items we both got our own.  The sizes were right, so eating one on your own didn't detract from your entree.For my appetizer, I knew right off the bat what I wanted:  Sauteed Garlic & Escargot.  It sounded a bit peculiar.  I'm used to eating my escargot just doused in garlic butter. This dish had the escargot very out in the open, so if you can't stand the look of them, this is NOT the dish for you.  What was more interesting is it was served with cherry tomatoes and small orange slices.  Honestly, I thought it was to die for.For my entree the waiter gave me several recommendations. I only eat seafood so he recommended the salmon which I was going to go for, but then I saw the ""Amsterdam Style"" mussels.  Now if you've had the mussels from HopLeaf they are not as good, but these were still damn fine, and it was an abundant amount.  I couldn't even finish mine.  They're served in a beer broth and with thinly cut french fries (I generally like thicker, but these paired better with the mussels) that were called ""truffle fries"" -- not to be honest, I don't know if that means that that is what they were fried in, but again very delicious!  I had sauvignon blanc from New Zealand (my favorite as of late) and it paired well with the light sauce and shellfish of my entree.  Perfet!My friend had the potato salad that has chorizo in it for an appetizer, and pork shoulder for his main dish. Although I don't eat meat, his food looked equally delicious and he certainly seemed pleased as well.  The way they serve their food is beautiful.  We didn't have enough room for dessert, but from what I could spy on at the other tables (I LOVE to check out what others are eating -- I'm so nosey), they looked just as good.I would go back here in a heartbeat.  Its cozy, its classic and the wait staff was wonderful.  No complaints whatsoever on my part!  Best of luck on their new restaurant!"
"The specials on the chalkboard outside taunt me every time I walk to and from the gym. Finally went a couple of weeks ago, and they did not disappoint. So much so that I went again a week later... and will probably go again soon. The food is absolutely delicious and the ingredient combinations are creative - felt like I was at an expensive restaurant downtown, but then the bill came and I realized I definitely was not. Of course I love the fact that it's BYOB being that I have a sizable wine collection from my winery working days that I need to get through before it succumbs to my poor storage situation. Last time I went I was more than bummed to learn that the short ribs I had been salivating over on the specials board had sold out by 730pm, and my switch to the lamb wasn't that spectacular, but the pork belly I had when I first went more than made up for that snafu."
"Bottom line: HB will not disappoint.I've been here a couple of times and thoroughly enjoyed each visit. The first time I nommed on a delicious marmalade and bacon sandwich (hands down the best I've ever eaten) which seemed a little out of place, but was lick-your-plate-clean-delicious. On my second visit I had a gnocchi entree which was delectable as well. The food may be a bit pricey, but considering you can BYO $4 bottle of crappy wine, I'm not complaining. Try to score a window seat for fun people watching!"
"HB is such a lovely romantic little place. The menu is original, though I couldn't quite figure out if the theme was Dutch, Kentuckian, or just eclectic. I had a salmon filet in a chantarelle sauce which had a particularly tasty, crispy skin, with plenty of pepper that gave it some kick. It came with a cauliflower puree, which I thought was an interesting idea (though cauliflowers aren't the world's most interesting tasting food).But the real reason I am writing this review is the desert. I had a caramel and strawberry brioche bread pudding and it was the single best thing I have tasted in months. It was soft and creamy with the perfect level of sweetness. It's been three weeks and I'm still dreaming about this desert. At HB deserts change daily, but if their other creations come close to this work of art, you'll be fine to order whatever they're serving."
"What an experience! Some of the best food (especially in the 'gourmet pub' category). Super friendly and observant service and the intimacy of the place is also super.I would rate the experience on level with other similar places like Gilt Bar and The Black Sheep (RIP), so if you combine it with the BYOB it is definitely worth a visit (or two or...)."
"Whoa.Went here last night and while the food was good. The service was pretty terrible. Our server, while apparent that she was trying to be kind, was super awkward.Anyway. After waiting 30 min to place our order we waited over 45 minutes for our food. Unacceptable. We didn't even get a 'sorry for the wait' --- When our server delivered our food we get 'omg which one goes to who, it's been so long that i forgot!' --- Really? REALLLLYYYY???I'll let this incident slide and give it another shot, the reviews on here are just too awesome to not give it another try. But seriously, what happened last night, HB!?!REALLY?!!?!?"
"Visited this restaurant last week with my wife.  We recently moved here from New York and are still amazed at the flood of ""gastrobubs"" in this town, so when we found a restaurant that offered more of an eclectic menu.  We enjoyed every last drop of the food here.  Braised veal was overflowing with flavor.  My wife's muscles were plentiful and delicious.  Obviously the BYOB doesn't hurt the effort.  The ambiance was very comfortable, but not college roommate row house comfortable.  Nice and classy, but not too stuffy.  The owner (Bob I think?) came out and spoke with us as well.  Great guy who knows his food.  We'll be back here often."
"A friend of mine knows the Chefs here and always raves about how wonderful it is, so she made reservations for five of us, and I'm oh so happy she did.  We FEASTED. Armed with one bottle of champagne and five bottles of wine (there were five of us you know) we started the night off with appetizers:  A gouda tasting, scallops and benedictine, and sweet corn bisque.  All three get five stars on a five star scale. Ooooo wee.  Between the appetizers and entrees, we all shared a mixed green salad with strawberries and candied pecans.  So good.  So good.  I crave it on a hot summer day.For my entree, I decided to be bold and go with the salmon (I'm not much of a fish eater).  It was the best piece of salmon I've ever had in my life. Perfection.  I can't remember clearly what came on the side (we were four bottles in at this time) but whatever it was, I give it five stars. It was delightful.We ended our feast with three desserts - bread pudding, a homemade chocolate brownie with vanilla ice cream, and some other sugary goodness (five bottles in at this point). Delisioso.There was a wait by the time we left and I understood why.  Everything about this place is top notch - the food, the service, the fun quotes on the wall, the positive ambiance.  Not to mention it's some of the best food I've ever had.  Hands down."
"I've been here for both dinner and for their brunch, and here are a few things I've noticed.1) get a reservation. It is a smaller place (probably not great for groups over 5), and it fills up quick. Without a reservation, you may end up sitting by the door waiting for a while.2) it is BWoB, even for Sunday morning brunch. Grab a bottle of bubbly and they will supply the orange juice.3) The service always seems a bit strained, like they are teetering on the edge of being understaffed. You may need to remind your waiter a few times if you need more coffee, water, etc. That being said, the staff is usually really friendly.4) imho, the brunch was way better than the dinner. For dinner I had the mussels, which I thought were nothing special. For brunch I had a pastrami omelet that was fantastic."
"We came for the wednesday prix fix after reading much about the great food this place offers. The inside is covered in mirrors and LOTS of candles, very cozy & small. We orderedfried oysters - OMG juicyalmond stuffed dates - bacon bacon bacon!!!simple mixed greens - simple yet yummymussels - OMG huge portion of juicy plump mussels!!!quails - very flavorfulbread pudding - tasted like apple pie.overall, it was a GREAT deal for $30 & the food was incredibly fresh. Make sure you make reservations & BYOB."
"The food at HB came darn-near close to being some of the best food my tongue's ever had the pleasure of coming in contact with.Good food has flavor. Good food has character and complexity. GREAT food has soul and that little something extra that MAKES you chew slowly and remember it. The scene at HB is warm and inviting. Albeit small, our large group had just the right amount of space that made family style dining that much more intimate. From the vintage mirrors lining the walls to the old school hutch with candle-topped, empty wine bottles, this place just oozed with comfort. We started with bacon wrapped dates, complete with almond cores, and Edam (artichoke and cheese) fritters that, both, got me salivating from first whiff.Next came seabass on plate. We're talking the whole bass - fins, eyes, bones and all. Clams and shrimp followed. So fresh. Slightly spicy. The last dish, which officially put me over the edge, was chicken atop a bed of cous cous and asparagus. Despite the lack of space in my stomach, I eagerly indulged in their nontraditional desserts including Belgian chocolate topped with sesame seeds, and strawberry pie with thyme. I carried no shame or regret.HB gave me that little something extra that I will NEVER forget."
"With vintage mirrors hanging on the wall, a curio cabinet housing wine glasses and appetizer plates, and an adorable restroom, I would describe HB as sexy, romantic, quaint, and charming. There is no denying HB is in an amazing space, and is full of ambiance. The food we ordered was tasty, I ordered one of the only vegan items on the menu, the Roasted Vegetable Couscous. flavor.explosion.in.my.mouth.The service was nothing to brag about and is one of the major reasons I only award this restaurant 3 stars. Our server was obviously uninterested in working with us, she was distracted by ""friends"" of hers at a near-by table, and she ignored us most of the time we were in the restaurant. For example, 5-10 minutes after we were finished with our meal (and the busboy had boxed our leftovers and taken our dishes away) our server stopped by, she explained the desserts offered that night .....and then disappeared. She never asked us if we'd like to order one of the desserts, didn't even give us an opportinity to speak up. She was gone in an instant. We eventually had to ask someone else for our check.Would I visit this restaurant again? PossiblyWould I recommend you visit this restaurant? Probably."
"I was there a while back and wasn't impressed by the menu.  It was limited in my opinion, and I had to struggle in selecting my choice.  I think I ended up getting lamb or veal - I really can't remember because I didn't want it originally and at that point focused on drinking wine, lol.  I know... my bad!But I was satisfied with the ambiance and atmosphere.  I recommend trying it, but it's not for everyone's palette."
"It IS worth the wait.  The place is teeny, as in, my 1100 sq foot apartment is bigger than this restaurant.  Needless to say, make a reservation.  But even with a reservation be prepared to possibly wait.My girlfriends and I went to dinner on Saturday night.  We had reservations at 8pm and arrived  promptly before our reservation in fear that we would lose it.  Unfortunately, the ""large"" table was still being occupied by the people who had the reservation before us and they were in no rush.  Unfortunately the restaurant doesn't have a bar and there's barely any kind of waiting room so the bottles of wine we brought to drink couldn't even be opened while we waited.  Sadly we waited about 15 minutes before we were seated, but from that time on everything was impeccable.  We shared the artichoke fritters, fresh mozzarella and bacon wrapped dates to start - both were so delicious, but the entrees are where it's at.  Me and 2 of my friends split 3 dishes - The fluke, mussels and the pork knuckle parpadelle.  All three were so amazing.  The broth in the mussels was so delicious and the fries were extra crispy.  The fluke was maybe my favorite thing it was nice and crisp but so creamy and smooth.  The parpadelle was so fresh and the pork was extremely tender.  We ended the night with the Baklava and bread pudding.  I don't know that those are consistent items on the menu but if they're offering the bread pudding when you're there than I recommend you order that.  It was so good.Overall everything was marvelous and the service was great - despite the bumpy start.  Definitely make a reservation and bring a bottle of wine (or 2)!"
"The Wednesday night prix fixe dinner is the best deal ever!  The bacon wrapped dates & truffle fries were A-MAZING, and so was my mahi mahi main course.  I don't usually order bread pudding as my dessert, but I may have to start after trying it here.  I loved everything about the meal (maybe except for the long wait in between courses)...and especially the fact that we got some free glasses of wine that they brought out to us as we were waiting for our table.  Delicious!"
"Easy to pass by but not easy to forget!This place was delicious, and a BYOB! (Great little wine shop about a block away, ask the host- he will direct you there in case you forget your goodies.)We started with the charcuterie. It was okay- some of the pork dishes were really salty.My fellow foodie ordered the trout. It had the look and consistency of salmon, but the flavor of trout. They enjoyed it.I had the pork pasta dish. it was huge! Good flavor, but not much to it. I would like to go back and give it another go."
"I LOVE LOVE LOVE this place!!!  My husband and I went on date night and called for last minute reservations for Wednesday night.  We were able to score a table plus it was $30 prix fixe price.  We got the following..Fried oysters - OK, it just wasn't that much flavor.  The whole time I just wanted to add hot sauceGouda cheese plate - delish and PLENTIFUL!  Most cheese plates are slivers of cheese, I swear if you add up the pieces it's like a wedge of cheese.Ceaser salad - standard, but fresh tastingQuail - my hubby loved itSeafood boubilause (sp?) - DELISH!!!  Tons of shellfish, I couldn't even each half of itCrossiant bread pudding - yummy!!!Loved all the food, service and will be coming back soon!"
"I don't hand out 5 stars very often, but HB earned every one.HB is a perfect place for a first date. The interior is cozy and warm, without being cramped or small. Lively without being loud. Perfect for conversation, and the BYOB option helps keep the evening under control. But call ahead! A fit of professional dating negligence led me to not call ahead for reservations, and we were told it would be an hour wait. We decided to hit up another bar, and this is where HB's customer service came in with flying colors. They offered to take our wine and chill it while we went somewhere else until our table was ready!The bacon-wrapped dates were insanely delicious, and for an entree, I had the Pork Papadelle, which was stellar as well. My date had the Mussels, which she loved. You know it's good food when the conversation practically stops during dinner and everyone's still smiling.The portions are generous and very filling. I would not advise ordering more than one appetizer, and it might even be a good idea to split it, as some of the apps are hearty enough to serve as meals in their own right.5 stars for HB. I hope to be back soon."
"I have a huge obsession with HB (or is it Home Bistro...). The food is always delicious and fresh. By BFF and I are frequently rolling in with a few bottles of wine and the staff is more than willing to keep them cool and flowing. My favorite entree has to be the mussels. They always taste delicious and fresh. The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is one server who is sometimes not that helpful or friendly, but everyone else there is great."
"The service and atmosphere is nice, very nice servers.  Way too noisy, however. My veal dish with lima beans was so incredibly salty, it was choking and I could not eat it."
"Made a reservation for 8:30 pm that night and man was it packed! The bf and I got there at 8pm, they asked if we could come back at like 8:15 pm to seat us.  Not bad. Like all the reviews, the place is really small but it's nice and cozy when you finally get your table. The ambiance is great, I love the writing on the wall and the lighting is nice and romantic. The place is BYOB and I think we were the only people that brought beer. Everyone else had wine at their table haha. The restaurant is nice and classy.  We ordered the bacon wrapped dates. I was a bit hesitant b/c I've never tried dates before but it was exquisite. I'm glad we were a little adventurous with that one.I didn't really like the menu. It has a lot of different entrees but I feel like it doesn't have ton of variety. The bf got the braised beef short rib and i ordered the cornmeal crusted catfish. Both were delicious. Our waiter wasn't overbearing, he gave us a lot of time (borderline too much time but it was a relaxing evening) and was really great about refilling our drinks. We also ordered this chocolate cake for dessert and it was delicious. i wish i had milk! :)Other than the beef short rib and catfish, I don't really know what else I'd like to try so I'm not sure if I'd go back there real soon. I do want to go back at some point though b/c the service is excellent and they're really great about making sure you have a table on time."
The Wed Night Prix Fix Dinners are a steal! Not to mention that byob already saves you some dough.The waitstaff is kind and so helpful! The food is amazing! The  ARTICHOKE & EDAM FRITTERS are amazing. The menu changes often. I had some seafood with curry and my friends had some bangers. All were amazing! I will definitely come back again!
"Not bad, not spectacular. Try to get one of the two tables near the windows for great people watching.small, quaint dining spacesmall, limited, yet creative menu.service, subpar. Food took a long time considering it was a slow sunday night. Loved the bacon wrapped dates and fried oysters. I tried my companions pork special--the lentils were delicious. I ordered the mussels for my entree because I heard how great they were...they were a little lack luster. Some had grit, some were empty. Some were broken---never serve a mussel with a broken shell."
"I cannot say an adequate number of great things about this place so I will not even try.  Just go here...it truly is amazing.  Also...BYOB...amazing, and I believe, a testament to the food.  The chef/owner cares about the food, and only the food, and it shows.  There is a great little wine shop called Kafka, a few doors south on the opposite side of Halstead...a great place to stop on your way to get some wine for your meal.The food was incredibly unique, fresh, and delicious.  Love the seasonal aspect as well."
"Dinner for six please! It was our first time at HB and I must say, everything we had was really tasty. My only comment would be that two of the dishes (the Pheasant and Cat Fish) were a little too heavy on the salt. Other than that, entree portions were very generous and appetizers were great to share. I loved the ambiance, it was lively without being too loud and very cozy. Make sure to save room for dessert, the s'mores were to die for and the homemade marshmallows are torched table side, how cool! We also had the butterscotch bread pudding which just melted in my mouth with deliciousness. I will definitely be back!"
"I've passed this place for years and been curious but overall didn't think much from the outside.  I was mistaken.  This place was great.  A nice variety (not huge but all delicious) and the best gnocchi I have EVER had.  Also a BYOB which is always nice.  Great service.  The only thing that leaves a star off is a) I didn't love either of the desserts and b) while everything was ok, some things lacked that extra little umphf that would give it a 5.  Still a great place to try!"
"Everything you would want for a neighborhood restaurant... Good food, great ambiance, BYOB!  The service is great too... friendly which is an added plus.  Every time I go there, I always have a great time and I have yet to eat something that I didn't like.  Delicious!"
"What a lovely restaurant. Went for the pre fixe Wednesday dinner. I had a hard time choosing between menu items... Everything sounded so amazing. Went with the HB Ham and Apples - good but no wow factor. Pork pappardelle  - perfectly cooked meat, absolutely amazing. Words cannot describe my dessert - some bread pudding with berries that was fabulous. And to top it all of its BYOB!Will be back, many times."
"This restaurant is unfair. The other, shit restaurants in the area simply can not compete with its food quality. And the service isn't annoying. It's like to talking to real people. Weird.GET THE BREAD PUDDING."
"We were here recently for a celebratory birthday dinner. We were looking for an upscale BYOB place since we had a nice bottle of wine to drink, and HB did not disappoint overall. The food was excellent- we especially loved the fried oysters (served over amazing grits!), the oxtail, and the bread pudding. Great value for the money, too. The service was great too. I give it 4 stars and not 5 because the music was too loud, which kind of ruined the ambiance for me. We were also disappointed with the size of the wine glasses. They were very small and we were drinking a full bodied red that really needed a larger glass."
"I loved Joncarl...he greeted us and opened our wine since we had to wait for our table. We went for my friend's birthday dinner and everything was absolutely wonderful...the appetizers, main plates, desserts, staff, environment, etc! We started with the artichoke fritters, almond stuffed dates and Amsterdam style mussles with truffle fries...yum! Everyone loved their main dish and we all shared so we could try everything. I had a wonderful ox tail...the meat literally fell off the bone! We ended with the chocolates and bread pudding (amazing)! Will definitely be back! I want to try the sister restaurant, Vincent, soon too!"
"Golly, what's another review for a place like this?  Five star reviews littering the page.  Go here.  Eat expensive food.  Expensive for a reason.  We had reservations early on a Thursday and were seated promptly.  After openning two Lagunitas Undercover investigation shutdown ales, our capable server informed us the pate was made from rabbit.Yes please.  My fiancee usually gets mad when I eat like a slob, but I just can't control myself around this stuff.  fresh sliced apples, some sort of onion jam.  Sheeeeeeiiit.    The main course was a lamb t-bone, hot damn.  Grilled a perfect medium rare, served with Cipollini onion tabbouleh.  Round after round of flavor, smacking me directly in the face.  ""Pay attention to me!""  I began to distract my fiancee so I could actually pick up the bones and suck them dry.  ""Look, a bus.""  And for desert, the famed croissant bread pudding, with homemade caramel sauce.  Game over.  Warm up the bus.  Turn out the lights.   It's the kind of food that you never want to have leave your body, just hold it in forever, in a perfectly undigested state.  It's the kind of meal you tell your coworkers about the next day, and then get offended when they're not as jazzed as you are about the rabbit pate. For a high-end date night, go here.  Enjoy every bite."
"YUM.  My roommate had been wanting to go here and we finally made the time to try it out one weekend.  It was so good.  For my entree I had this delicious wild boar and pappardelle pasta dish with some sort of cream sauce and it was really really really good.  One of my friend's had the gnocchi and she really liked it, but also had a soup to start out - some sort of chicken broth based soup and it was extremely salty, so I'd skip on that.  Another friend had the mussels and liked it, and I can't remember what my other friend had...BUT, the best part by far was the dessert.  We tried their papaya bread pudding, and it was seriously the best dessert ever.  I'm not even a big fan of bread pudding to start with, but seriously, it was so amazing.I took off a star because I went back for the prix fixe menu one Wednesday and it wasn't as amazing of an experience.  I had the duck sausage mint fettuccine dish and the pasta had a weird taste to it.  Otherwise, still love the place and will definitely be back."
HB was fabulous!! The tastiest food I've eaten in months and the service excelled.  Plus the BYOB policy is icing on the cake.  I love taking out of town guests to this humble little space and blow their minds on the food.
"A place that feels like, well, HOME.  What I would really like to note about HB is the incredibly warm atmosphere created by chef/owner Joncarl and his staff.  Absolute sweethearts.  I can't express how welcome and valued you are made to feel from the moment you make a reservation until the moment you complete your meal, absolutely satisfied.  It is clear to see that Joncarl has tremendous pride in his food and in his establishment - and justly so.  There isn't much else I can add that 400 others haven't - everything we ordered was delicious and the portions are very generous.  HB - you're at the top of my list.  I wish it didn't take me so long to try you, but now I look forward to returning again and again."
"I have to admit, my yelp reviews so far make me look like a novice diner that will give 5-stars to anyone with a plate of food and a forced smile at the door.  Not True.  That being said, HB hit it big on all fronts to score the highly laudable 5 star rating.My first impression took shape when I called for a reservation in anticipation of my mom's visit the upcoming weekend.  The man who I spoke with was extremely accommodating, mentioning that a large party would be there at the time I requested but that they were happy to have us if we didn't mind a little noise (that being said, I didn't notice any abundant noise that evening).  When I confided it was my first visit, my host replied welcome and how happy he was that we would be dining with them.  (who says that in Chicago!?)My mom and I arrived right on time with our bottle of wine in tow.  We were warmly greeted and seated at a cozy table for two.  You can't escape coziness in this one-room candlelit, dining establishment with quotes from famous foodies (like Miss Piggy) painted on the walls.  Almost the vibe of being in a friend's home - but with better food than most friends could prepare!  The food was generously proportioned - more so than I would expect with such high quality ingredients.  We were given little bites of bread and balsamic vinegar to start and ordered the mixed olives.  I ordered the bibb lettuce salad, which was much larger than your typical starter salad and well decorated with pear, blue cheese, pancetta and brazil nuts- very satisfying.  My mom had the house salad, which while more simple, was served with a delicious home made vinaigrette. For our main courses, we ordered the mahi mahi in a tomato ragout and beef brisket in parsnip potato mash, which just about melted in your mouth.  Everything tasted exquisite -  fresh with a well-thought-out balance of flavor.  The beef brisket was more than most people could finish, but still well presented and not glutenous looking in the least.We were too full for dessert, but I can bet it is worth the extra course.  Oh, and did I fail to mention that the byob is free of any corkage charge!  Unbelievable for that caliber restaurant. I cannot wait to return to HB and try even more of their delectable dishes!!"
"I was really excited to try this restaurant with all its great reviews but a lot of things were pretty hit or miss there with me.Location:Great location - smack in the middle of a busy neighborhood with lots of shops, bars and restaurants.  Parking is no problem with tons of metered parking everywhere.Decor and Mood:Great - it was cozy and not too much of the in-your-face hipster avant-garde going on.  It seemed a great place to either take family, friends, or even a date for a candle-lit dinner.Service:Excellent.  Our waiter was kind and checked in on us often enough.  Endless dipped bread was provided on cue and we never ran out of water.Food:This was the real hit or miss.  I feel that this restaurant is definitely worth coming back to try more things on the menu.  The price is great - $30 for an appetizer + salad + entree or appetizer + entree + dessert.  The appetizer I had was a special of the day and was pretty great though the bread seemed a little old.  I also had the fried oysters which were pretty unpleasant - the crispy skin just seemed to fall off the oyster from being soaked in a bowlful of the vinegar it floats in.  and it's a LOT of vinegar.  This was definitely a miss and I DON""T recommend it.For her entree, my friend got the veal chili on what had to be au dente noodles which were a little too au dente for my taste - it felt like noodles that had been out just a little too long and were very rubbery.  The chili was nothing special.For my entree, I got the other special of the day which was a Chicken Mousseline - it was NOT too bad but it seemed very one-note.  Like it was missing a major acid or something else to eat alongside.  However, the worst problem by far was the absolute saltiness of the crispy skin - in the end, what could have been a great dish amounted to some one-note over-salty chicken sausages that definitely left me craving a lot of water.Conclusion:Definitely worth another try - it was too bad some of the dishes were just off."
"The food and service at HB has been exceptional all the times I've been here.  First of all, when I go to HB, I usually bring a bottle of wine since it's BYOB, which is awesome.  The atmosphere is nice but casual and very intimate.  It's not overwhelming or noisy, and is perfect for a date.  I've also been here with family and friends alike of varying ages -- and no matter who I was with, we always felt very comfortable and relaxed.As for the food -- the restaurant uses incredibly fresh ingredients, particular in the seafood.  The vegetables also seem very fresh.  I don't always like fish at restaurants, but the dish I ordered last time I was there was superb.  It was done just right, with a lot of flavor, but not overwhelming or salty.  Sadly, it's no longer on the menu.  The good news is the menu rotates so you can try new things.  I've tried the mussels before (which is always on the menu it seems), which makes for a very satisfying dish.  I've also tried a lamb and sausage dish before, and think that their seafood is better than their meat dishes, but both are excellent.I want to make a specific comment about the bacon-wrapped dates.  It seems like these days, every restaurant I go to serves this dish.  A lot of places do it really well; Avec and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba come to mind.  So unless you want the same thing over and over again, I would recommend trying something different at HB for an appetizer.  It's good but not anything unique.But what is best about HB is the bread pudding!  I don't usually even like bread pudding, but this is the most amazing dessert I think I've ever eaten.  I mean that literally.  It was so good, we ordered another one and I will be ordering it every time I go.  Try it!  You will not be disappointed!"
"Bacon wrapped dates! Amazing entrees and the truffle fries were great. BYOB and the service was fantastic, the owner shared a bit of his Dutch snack with us. The charm made HB even better. However, the bread pudding that day was just fair."
"Joncarl has a magic touch.  His food is amazing, he is charming, and his restaurant is romantic, warm, and inviting.  The food is spectacular (we had the rockfish, the pork pot pie, and the almond stuffed dates - all are amazing) but, what made me LOVE and never want to leave was Joncarl.  From the second you arrive until the moment you leave, Joncarl will treat you like family or a long-lost-best-friend.  That sense of comfort and familiarity coupled with the truly fantastic menu is the magic. Go check this place out, you won't be disappointed."
"I came here on a Thursday night around 6. I read a lot about needing reservations so I got them, but really, in Chicago, nobody eats dinner at 6. It did start to fill up a bit by 8, but even then I don't think it was completely packed.The staff was very friendly and chatty, and helpful with the menu. Which, I have to say, is weird. It's like they designed every dish on there to have one little word in it that made you immediately decide not to get it. But you know what I think? Just go for it. Because everything I had was great, even if it did come from a cow's cheek.We got some sort of salmon purée on bread as an appetizer, and it was pretty delicious. The entrees were both specials, a ricotta gnocchi and of course the cow cheek and mashed potatoes. Both really good. The cow cheek was kind of like brisket I think? And the gnocchi was also good, I think there was some pumpkin in there too.For dessert, we had the white chocolate caramel bread pudding, which was pretty delicious. Very moist and caramelly.Oh and don't forget the decor, it's very warm and inviting inside, and well decorated with interesting art."
"Wow, what a wonderful dining experience. Their food is very, very good. BYOB. Very intimate and cozy little restaurant. I highly recommend the chicken thigh entree!"
"Very good meal, great service and atmosphere.  Nice German and French combo.  Fries are great and of course byob"
"Great little Bistro, we had the pre-fix dinner, great deal..   I actaully saw a few diners pass on this, but if they checked the prices, the pre-fix three course is less expensive than any two courses..  Any ways..  Mussels and frites great, Snails great..  Frisie salad great, Wild boar pasta bland. The seasonal Pate..  Tasteless ...  It was a Mushroom punkin seed pate,  If the Manager reads this, please inform your staff to detail the pate prior to ordering.  I was expecting a porkey goodness, and I got e Vegan blandness..     The rest of the meal rocked, and I got a my wife a free desert out the icky app..  So..  four stars"
"I really liked this place. It's casual but the food is upscale and reasonably priced. And it's BYOB, so you can have a wonderful meal on a budget. It's a small space, so you're better off getting a reservation. The portions are quite generous. I loved the truffle fries."
"You are now reading ...Drum roll please boom boom boom boom boom (I suck at drums)... my 100th review!  (you do not win a prize, sorry)* Balloons fall from ceiling ** Fireworks erupt out of your CD-rom drive*HB was great!  We got a lovely window seat, and just sat down when the waiter mentioned that the place was BYOB.  I DNBMOB, so he told me to run to the wine store ( yelp.com/biz/kafka-wine-… ) a block away and get something.  I ran like Forrest Gump (my date did not appreciate the effort) and got something to pair with the lamb burger I was about to have.  That and the truffle fries on the side (was in my truffle phase yelp.com/biz/pastoral-ch… ) made for an excellent meal.  I haven't been back yet, but my own review is making me hungry, so maybe soon ..."
"I came to Home Bistro with my family this holiday week and it was absolutely fantastic if you only consider what I got, pretty good if you factor in everyone else. We went on a Wednesday so four out of the five of us got the $30 prix frie.We got the bacon wrapped dates which were great, the spanish mackarel which was all right, edam and artichoke fritters which were also all right and the sweetbread which was good as well.Then came the salads. The ferro salad is really really good, one of those dishes that makes you want to recreate at home and eat every day if you could. Highly recommend this dish. My mom got the pastrami salad which was good but not as good as the ferro.For the mains, I got the rainbow trout which I highly recommend. Paired with potatoes and soft boiled eggs, the entire dish was delicious. My mom really liked her oysters and truffle fries (actually lets face it all of us probably ate more fries than her; the fries were good)...my sister and brother both got the lamb shoulder which was a bit too strong of a flavor for my brother. The soaked cornbread was also a bit too sweet. My sister's came out too salty which was interesting that two identical dishes came out very differently flavor wise.My dad got the mos expensive main on the list, the poached sturgeon which definitely didn't live up to our expectations. I definitely preferred my trout but maybe it was just a taste preference. Dessert. Ok if there's anything with chocolate, you have to get that. We got the eggnog bread pudding and the white chocolate/dark chocolate bark which was the ""best dessert"" that my brother had eaten. We even got seconds because it was so good so definitely recommend anything chocolate at HB."
"4.5 stars!!!!  We plan to go back again soon, because I think this is a potential 5 star update :)Service - top notch!  Waitress was always pleasant and smiling.  Opened our bottle of wine (BYOB BABY!) and stopped by to pour often.  The owner/chef came out and talked to guests, served some dishes too.  I love to see that interaction!Food -f-f-f-fantastic!  We got the artichoke fritter appetizers, which were kind of like artichoke-dip hush puppies.  It came with a garlic mayo dipping sauce.  Very tasty.  For our entree we split a heaping bowl of mussels, that came with a huge side of thin fries.  The mussels had great broth and unique flavors.  The fries were also served with garlic mayo and really hit the spot - I think they had truffle oil.  The owner came by and suggested we put a few fries in the broth at the bottom of our mussel dish and let them soak, then eat them ""it's tradition here"". Glad we did.  The main thing this place lacks is size/space.  They do pack you in close to your neighbors and it is hard not to listen in on others.  My hubby and I came with a bag each (mine was wine, his computer straight from work) - so that made it even tighter.We were extremely happy campers and will come back for sure!!!"
"Yuuuum. Truffle fries truffle fries truffle fries! Each nice crunch oily bite was a tiny explosion of truffle flavor. I'm not faddish with food and had read a while back that truffle was no longer in fashion but who cares, if you like truffle and you like fries, HB does it well. And their focaccia with balsamic roasted garlic vinaigrette is amazing. Not the best place if you're on any diet of some sort because they really do serve some might hearty fare!Came here last night for two others on a nice Sunday evening. The restaurant was busy but not too loud or claustrophobic. The service from beginning to end was nothing but friendly and happy and general niceness. Prices may be on the higher side but portions are HUUUUGE. We shared the beet salad--thinly sliced roasted beets with TRUFFLE vinaigrette over greens. Yuuum. I got the braised chicken in phyllo with yogurt sauce over couscous. Yum. It was a nice big baked present with generous portions of tender dark meat and some melted cheese (which unfortunately I did not catch the name of but it on the lighter side). My friend's lamb burger was juicy, topped with melted brie all on a big bad pretzel roll. Unfortunately no free desserts here for bday. They charged us for the dessert a la candle on top (and we didn't even get to choose...boo). Their chocolate hoho wasn't overly sweet so I appreciated it. It was basically soft and fluffy chocolate cake with lots of fluffy whipped cream and some hardened chocolate over it."
"Came here for another birthday dinner. Excellent food and great variety. $30 prix fixe was great, and we got 4 appetizers and 3 entrees (double on the salmon) among our table. Excellent food. BYOB is a huge plus. Intimate in size but tables are not cramped together. Service was friendly, but I have to mention that the waitress spilled wine on my mother's pants while pouring - now I get it that you're no sommelier or anything, but it's just serving 101 to shield your patrons from stains...I'll write off the long follow up time to the possibility that she may not have been able to find seltzer water, and give her half a point back for being apologetic and friendly.Mishaps aside, this is a standout place that executes its food and ambiance strongly, and each dish I tasted was worthy of ordering again. Get at it."
"Went here for a birthday meal last year and the memory is still fresh. Tasty, interesting food at reasonable prices for relatively fine dining. And BYOB! What!"
"$30 prix-fixe was such a good deal. We went to another place with a similar deal and this blew  it away. We arrived without reservations at around 6ish and it was packed soon after. The service was really great and everyone was extremely helpful. The menus change, but the dishes that stood out were the rabbit risotto and the pork belly entree. Both fantastic. Definitely recommended and it's also byob."
"Everything that Yelp has been saying about HB is 100% correct.  Usually when you dine at a  moderately expensive / fancy restaurant you get tiny little card deck sized portions for each dish.  HB has great food but surprisingly hefty portions.  I ordered the 12 hour braised beef brisket with mashed potatoes and it literally melted in my mouth.  The slices of slaw added some texture and rounded out the dish.  The dish was frickin huge and I could barely finish it but it was so good that I found a way.For starters we had the almond stuffed dates and the fritters.  Both were excellent, but the artichoke and edam fritters dish was a meal in itself - I literally could have eaten that and been satisfied for the night.  For dessert we tried the bread pudding (awesome) and a couple other things that my girlfriend loved by I didn't really try much. Oh yeah, the atmosphere and service were outstanding.  Definitely check this place out, you will be happy, slightly drunk (bring a couple bottles), and very full when you leave."
"This is a very well decorated, great ambience restaurant with staff that is very courteous and welcoming. I love their affordable prices and what makes it THE best restaurant on that area... The food! Everything is amazing, the portions, the flavor, the presentation, again the flavor. It is a great place for friends, dates or just grabbing a bite before going out. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago."
"Wow HB does not dissappoint!  I had been looking forward to this experience for two weeks, ever since my friend confirmed that he made reservations for us for 8pm!  HB is a great place for a date or a small group of friends, it does get loud in there but if you are with great company, you barely notice it.  Each table is lite with a little candle so it creates a cozy dinner atmosphere, plus its BYOB and the great Kafta wine store is across the street, so right away you know you have it made, BYOB and a great dinner!  Now for the food!For appetizers we ordered a side of truffle fries and the bacon wrapped dates.  With the side of fries, we were expecting a little plate....the waiter walks out with this huge bowl over flowing with hot thin crispy fries with a side of mayo.  Truffle oil heaven!  It was very dangerous to have the bowl right in front of me and I basically went to town on the fries!  Next were the bacon wrapped dates..ok I know I am weird but I don't like bacon so these were just eh for me.  I feel like the Baba Reeba ones are better, but then again I really can't critic them since I don't like bacon.  Onto the entrees!  I ordered the trout.  Now fish I feel, is pretty hard to make right in restaurants.  But this trout...was tender and moist, and it came with this buttery broth that was delicious, and I loved the thinly sliced potatoes and braised greens that came on top of the trout.  I finished everything on my plate!  My friends ordered the lamb pie - which was minced lamb with yummy cheese and peas wrapped up in pyhllo.  I highly recommend this entree, it was surprisingly light for a lamb pie dish.  My other friends ordered the quail and the whole striped bass.  HB definitely knows how to make their fish!Now onto my favorite part....dessert!  Ok so...when the waiter was listing off the desserts, I already knew I wanted to try the famous bread pudding..so we ordered that, and then the waiter said salted caramel brownie and then I was like ok sold!  So then the brownie comes out, it looks like a very thin brownie with whipped cream on top, I take a forkful with whipped cream and caramel sauce on top and at first I am like this is great, its chocolately and warm and gooey with a little hint of salt but as you keep chewing you notice that ew the saltness is not going away and you feel like you are chewing salt!  Ok so HB I love you but can you put a little less salt and a LOT more chocolate into your brownies.  I know you said salty caramel brownie but if I knew I was going to be chewing salt gum, I would have ordered two bread puddings instead!  So now for the bread pudding, it was made just the way I like it, warm bread budding that is warm, intense yet light, drizziled with caramel sauce and whipped cream.  My friend and I were scrapping the caramel off the plates when all of the bread pudding was gone and my friend jokingly asked if I was going to lick the plate..and I actually stopped to think about it.  HB I will definitely be back here!  And I am excited to try all of the other entrees and desserts here!"
"How does this place not have a solid 5?!  Probably the best restaurant I've been to in Chicago as far as the overall dining experience goes.  BYOB, EXCELLENT service, FANTASTIC food.  I've dreamt about this place ever since going.  Truffle fries, brisket, and bread puddings are all stellar.  I also had some seafood stew special that is making my mouth water just thinking about it.It's pricey, but it's worth every penny."
"I have been going to HB on a regular basis for a couple of years now and still haven't fallen out of love with the place.  Best things about HB:- There is rarely a dud on the seasonally-changing menu.  My favorites from the past: bacon wrapped dates, beef brisket over a parsnip puree, lamb burgoo, anything that will come with a side of the ridiculously good cheddar grits, and (of course) the bread pudding.  Oh and the frites.  And mussels.  And ....  :)- The staff and owner are the friendliest I've met in Chicago.  They always seem to be in good moods and are great at doing their jobs- It's a BYOB, which is inherently awesome.  That, and the reasonable price of the food, makes this place utterly affordable.Downsides:   None come to mind....other than it can sometimes be hard to get a reservation for a prime time (friday/saturday nights).Also worth checking out is Vincent in Andersonville (the owner of HB's new venture...similarly great!)."
"I have had the HONOR of dining here about 4 times now, and each one as been a unique and extremely pleasant experience.  It's always been on a Friday, and we've have to cross our fingers hoping they can squeeze us in last minute.  Without fail, they have always pulled through for us.  The customer service is top-notch.  Each staff member is a super friendly, enthusiastic, passionate foodie whose love for what they do emanates.  Getting down to brass tax, the FOOD!  Wow!  The menu has a few killer staples such as the bacon-wrapped dates, the artichoke and edam fritters (GIANT deep fried balls of warm gooey deliciousness), and the Amsterdam mussels with truffle oil fries.  The rest of the menu is seasonal, and rotates accordingly.  Last time I had the braised rabbit risotto (which I found out later was cooked in the style of ""Fatal Attraction"" [ie: youtube.com/watch?v=_kaS… ] as opposed to braised, but still amazing.)  I have also had the Mahi Mahi with littleneck clams, olives, ceci-tomato ragout, and rouille.  In addition, I have tasted the the herb roasted chicken.  Needless to say, these peeps know what to dish out when the time is right. I have never been let down, and as a result I will continuously return.  Without fail.  This place is perfect for the adventurous  and passionate eater, and not for those that want a basic burger n'fries.  It's BYOB (B.A.D.A.S.S.), and there is no corkage fee.  The portions are substantial, and the price is A-Okay considering it's a nicer place.  Yummers!"
"This place was absolutely wonderful!  We went with a large group, so we could try everything.  I ordered the short ribs with pumpkin seeds and some sort of puree that escapes me now, but I assure you that it was one of the most tender cuts of meat I have ever enjoyed in a restaurant.  The girlfriend ordered the Vegetable Cous Cous, which was out of this world.  Perfectly cooked with the perfect amount of spice.  Also at the table were the pork pappardelle and a homemade bacon sandwich that were devine.Desserts were unbelievable.  Bread pudding with blackberry topping, homemade Ho-Ho's (yes, you read that right), Baklavah, and a plum cobbler.  Of these, I would say that the bread pudding was by far the best.Plus, its BYOB, which is always a plus.  Overall, I would highly recommend this restaurant, and I am sure that I will be back."
"Yes, good food. But we had to wait way too long for the bill.  And it was really loud, tight, and claustrophobic for me.I have an open mind for more stars on a week night when I hope it's not such a zoo."
"Overall: Worth EVERY penny, even if you have to fly all the way from SoCal. The blueberry bread pudding almost made me cry a little, it was so good.Visits: Once, dinnerI could go on about the service*, the atmosphere**, or the price***, but why bother when the real star here is the food?Appetizer - Fried artichoke and edam. (youtube.com/watch?v=ufJT…) I probably shouldn't have ordered a deep fried, cheesy appetizer, but ... how could I resist? So good I ate four of the six balls even though I knew I should be saving room for the other two courses.FULLNESS RATING: Full.Entree - Pork chops with mango something something reduction and grits. Oh man, they gave two giant pieces of pork, each like an inch thick. It was crazy. Cooked to perfection and seasoned perfectly - a little salt, pepper, and a slight tanginess from the mango sauce. So good. Only thing I woulda changed was the grits.  I'd rather have mashed potatoes. But it's probably better they offered grits since I wouldn't have been able to fit the mashed potatoes in my tummy.FULLNESS RATING: Erg. That doesn't feel so good.Dessert - I was already stuffed to the gills when I finally got to dessert - blueberry bread pudding. The waiter said it was kinda the thing they were known for, and boy can I see why. Warm, pillowy, sweet, comforting. This is officially going on my list of perfect foods****. It was so good my taste buds took over my body and scarfed down 3/4 of it before my stomach even realized what had happened.  It got to the point where I had to do the I-ate-too-much wiggle -- you know, the one that goes, ""back and forth, side to side, I need to get more food inside!""FULLNESS RATING: I am afraid if I take another bite something will literally burst and I will go into septic shock and DIE.______________* Great, but amusingly confused when I called to make a reservation for -- ""How many?"" ""One."" ""Oh...?"" Screw you social stigma! I want my goddamn FOOD!** Candlelight is great for romantic dates (although it can get a bit loud in the small restaurant), not so great if you woke up at 6 am that morning to catch a flight and want nothing more than to pass out. *** Wednesday night prix fixe meal - $30 for appetizer, salad OR dessert, and an entree.  Enough to feed two people. Believe me, I tried to eat one all by myself.****Also on the list: panino con bollito (bookofjoe.com/2006/10/wo…) and, possibly, jalapeno cheddar Cheetos."
"Wow.  Just wow.  Can I leave it at that?The Hubs took me to HB for my bday dinner, and we did the prix fixe menu.  Well, we tried....we may have ordered a couple of extra things along the way, LOL.  Everything we had was awesome.  We started with the fritters, the bacon wrapped dates (a.k.a. what the owner called bacon candy), and the smoked eggplant.  All three of the apps were DELISH.  I could maybe have a million of those little dates.  Side note, is it wrong/gross that I totally ate the pieces of caramelized brown sugar that were left in the dish? Ummm yeah, I did that.For our salads the Hubs went with the strawberry spinach and I went with the citrus salad.  I'll admit that I'm not the type of girl that will order salads, though I probably should more often, but the dressings on both the salads were really good.  Now...the entrees. I opted for the short ribs, and the Hubs had the coriander salmon.  Man oh man....soooooooo good.  Both our entree plates were licked clean, I did finished mine off in a lady-like fashion, obvs.  We ended the dinner with the bread pudding. HOLY COW. The bread pudding was amaahhhhhhhzzzziiing.I loved everything about HB.  The staff was nice, the service was on point, and most importantly the food is delicious.  The Hubs and I are already scheming our next visit to the restaurant!"
"I love this place. I really really really love it. Seriously one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. There isn't a thing on the menu that isn't delightful and so reasonably priced its crazy. we fed 5 people, stuff to the gills for $60....WHAT??? CRAZINESS!!!-Mussels (A+)-Lamb Burger (A+)-Truffle Fries------drool. (A+)-Escargot (A+)-Bacon Wrapped Dates (A+)Just know that its BYOB.Did i say that I love this place??"
"Hands down one of the best meals I have ever had.  The restaurant is small, and it really makes the place feel special.  There is awesome photography all over the wall, especially in the bathroom.  Enough of the ambiance, now onto the food.  The food was amazing.  I ordered escargot and the bacon wrapped dates.  Both were mothafuckin great.  I had never had escargot before, and it was AWESOME.  For the main course, I ordered the pork shank.  It was a huge hunk of meat with fancy mushrooms all in a great sauce.  It was super tender and really flavorful.  My date got the winning meal of the decade, Lamb Belly.  We were sort of wavering on what to order, so we asked the waiter for his opinion.  Before anything was said, he shouts ""LAMB BELLY, It's like lamb bacon!""  He sold us in a single sentence.  It was out of control good. You are given a massive portion of seared, seasoned lamb belly, on a bed of these little black lentils, all topped with green tomatoes.  It all went together so well.  I loved this place, and they were extremely nice, and the food straight rocked.  Plus the place is BYOB, which is AWESOME for a Californian like me....we don't have nice things like that.  So we paired our meal with some summer variety of Goose Island I found at the 7-11 across the street.  What a great meal."
"Wow! Possibly the best French Fires I have ever eaten and this is coming from a man who has downed a fry or two in his days.  I didn't even order fires my wife did and they were quickly devoured by half the table (of guests, the table itself was not eating our food). I ordered the fried catfish, which was lightly fried covered with black eyed peas and greens. It was fried just right; you could still taste the fish not just the fired batter.  I also ate portions of other peoples dished which were all superb (The Muscles, Fries, & Shrimp and Grits). Whoever the chef is at this place has some serious skills. Waitress was excellent also. Overall, this is the best American (traditional) food I have had in the city so far. I highly recommend HB."
"This place is BYOB, which is great, and there's a nice little wine shop nearby called Kafka. I got the mussels and truffle fries, which were tasty! My companion got the special pork loin, and was disappointed and said it was dry.We had also started off with the almond-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon. It was tasty and interesting to try, but I probably wouldn't want to eat it very often.This place as a whole is overpriced, but maybe worth checking out once or twice."
"AMAZING!!! My husband and I went for our anniversary there, by far the best meal we have ever had.  We have been raving to our friends.  We went on a Wednesday  which was pre-fix meals. We had the artichoke fritters so soft and delicious.  The entrees were big portioned, I had the shrimp and mussels, and he had the beef.  Both were made excellently, dessert (bread pudding) was great too!! Overall the restaurant had a relaxed and mellow environment where you were not afraid to try something new or ask questions about the food.  The waiter was super friendly and they gave us a seat by the window after waiting for our seats for quite a while.  Oh,by the way, its BYOB!!!  That made it even better.  I would recommend reservations on Wednesday, because it was pretty full when we went.  I will definitely return with friends!!!"
"This place is great. For some reason I haven't been back (perhaps a little pricier than my usual fare). Food was delicious. My boyfriend and I went here for an anniversary. We brought our wine. The appetizers we got were really tasty and both of use really enjoyed our main courses.The service here was also great! The chef came out and asked us if we liked our food and sat and chit chatted for a couple minutes. Our waiter was really on top of things and was very friendly.My only criticism is that its very close quarters and their happened to be a rowdy party there that night which was slightly disruptive. Otherwise, the atmosphere would have been perfect.Im going to have go back soon..."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE LOVE!  So much love and passion from the owner which is represented by the menu, staff, and ambiance.  I visit HB about once a month and can't ever get enough.  I tell everyone about it and will continue to do so!"
"The Food:  Fantastic.  I had the rosemary crusted Amish chicken breast and it was some of, if not the best, chicken I've ever had.The Prices:  Prices ran a lil' higher than I expected.  Most plates are in the $15-20 range.The Atmosphere:  The place is very cozy and, while it looks like a nice place for a conversation from the outside (dimly lit, candles on the tables), the patrons were all absurdly loud.  Obviously I wasn't here for a date, but it's certainly not the kind of atmosphere I'd expected.  That's the main reason for the star deduction.Bottom line:  Definitely a great place to go to for great tasting food, though I wouldn't recommend it if you're looking for a quiet date spot."
"Pardon this review for any mistakes that are about to happen- grammatically or spelling or even nonsensical.  For I am admittedly drunk as I type this out.Earlier today I got word that I would be a part of a dinner involving non-English speaking people and the wine that they produce.  That's write- foreign wine producers.  In this case French, for which anyone that knows me should not be a surprise, considering I am lucky enough to be married to a pretty well connect French woman.In the case of this evening, it was all originally due to the lovely Mireille D. a Yelper who isn't able to be super-active, but a wonderful lady nonetheless.  She was contacted recently through her work to help out a duo of young French wine producers to be a part of a series of wine tastings and sales pitches to distributors based here in the US and abroad.  Her job, was to help with translation and interpretation.  Luckily, the job turned out to be cool enough to be an enjoyable weekend, and due to the trio being busy, my wife was contacted to find a good BYOB place to go to on a Sunday night with not too much time to prepare.  HB came to mind to her immediately.So, my wife called today before noon and left a message letting them know that she was interested in securing a table for five around 7:30 in the evening.  Within an hour or so, she got a call, directly from the chef de cuisine, Jan Carl (spelling?) in regards to her request.Remarkably, he remembered us coming in about three months ago for our first meal there.  He even went out of his way with some cordial remarks in French (which from what I can tell is quite good!), and invited us to join them that evening.  My wife explained that we had some guests that are wine producers, and Jan Carl was very excited about what would be in-store for us.Upon arriving, our guests brought out a total of six bottles of their wine for the five of us.  The waiter wasn't quite sure how to react to us for this, but realized quite quickly that we were the drunk-ass Frenchies that brought along the producers of supposedly great wine (and selling for up to $450/bottle- it better had been good wine!).  He was attentive and friendly, and made sure that we were well taken care of.Since our new buddies had been tasting and eating all day long, they made it clear that they weren't ready for the typical American dinner, which by French standards is quite large.  We therefore opted for a series of starters which were all fantastic.For anyone who doesn't understand the HB concept- it is similar to the many ""New American"" restaurants out there, but HB is decidedly Dutch.  For example- the escargot that we had was definitely not the French style.  Our new friends had a hard time finding the escargot considering they are already out of their shells and are in a delicious mix of tomato, orange, bread and herbs.  Very nice!  There are also a lot of other Dutch elements to the cooking that make the HB experience quite unique.We also enjoyed the Gouda plate, which had three different cheeses.  The five-year aged cows milk one from a Dutch woman in Wisconsin was fantastic.  The shrimp and herring specials were very good too.  Herring piled on a rye cracker with slivered onion and creme fraiche was nice in my opinion, and tiger prawns with candied orange rind and a nice sauce was very good too.We skipped main course (I guess in favor of even more wine- and yes, be jealous, very good wine at that!) and were given no problems by our wonderful server.  Dessert orders were taken much later in the night and were very nice- a bread pudding- something decidedly American and new to our French guests, and a pane cotta (spelling?) that was rich, creamy and delicious.Like the terrific hosts that they were, HB's staff allowed us to linger for a long time after eating, finish our wine and conversation- and even joined us eventually.  Wonderful hospitality!"
Apple-pastrami salad might be the best salad i've ever had. A song from the Grease soundtrack came on while we were finishing up around 11. HB can do no wrong in my book.
"Glad we found this place.  This is a nice BYOB that's good for a date, or to catch up with friends.  Everything on the menu is recognizeable, but with a new twist to it.  I had the Lamb burger with pomme frittes, which was awesome but a very large quantity.  I've also had the Wild Boar, which was perfectly cooked, and came with amazing mashed potatoes. I would definitely recommend making reservations, though, unless you're going at an odd time (Tues - Wed, or outside of meal times). The staff are really friendly as well.  They take good care of you."
"This place was recommended to me from a co-worker.  I thought it was somewhat overrated. The food was good but not fabulous. I had the escargot as an appetizer and the salmon as an entree. I enjoyed both but wasn't blown away by either and the coating on the salmon was too salt-heavy for my liking.Additionally, I thought our service was somewhat poor (and it's not a big place so it's not like the kitchen could get backed up to any degree.) All in all it was fine, but that's it and a little pricy to boot. And keep in mind that it is very loud for a very small place."
"I've been here a few times, and it's always great food and service.  They're BYOB so remember to bring a nice bottle of wine or beer.  The almond stuffed dates are delicious for an appetizer.  Make sure to save room for their bread pudding too."
"We came to HB with a party of 12.  I thought they did a great job accomodating us.  The service was very attentive and the food was very good.  It's BYOB and there's a nice wine shop about 2 blocks South, which is nice."
"Go here and eat, it's very very good and they are super nice and friendly."
"I came here after hearing all the GNO peeps giving it high praise. I brought two of my friends and we just basically ordered a few appetizers as we weren't too hungry.First the place is quite cozy indeed. As several have mentioned, It is perfect for a date night or nice quaint dining with good company. The decor blends well with nice little touches.As for the food, well it was a delight ordered several items off the menu. Each was different in it's own way and not the usual things I order. We got the artichoke & edam fritters, baked haloumi cheese, uitsmijter and the mixed greens salad.  The roasted garlic aioli went well with the fritters as well as the kumquat preserve with the cheese. The uitsmijter was a nice change of pace as it was like a nice breakfast appetizer. The service was spot on and having this place be a BYOB sure does help. I didn't get to try any entrees or desserts but that I'll save for a date night for sure."
"HB is deelish with a capital DEE! We went for their Valentine's day four course menu, trekking all the way from Wicker Park in the snow and cold. HB certainly warmed us up. The cheerful reception, prompt service and yummy food was just what the awful weather called for. Like everyone else on here says, the beef brisket is oh so good, and the quail is nice and yum. I think my favorite part of the after-meal was the dried cherry bread pudding. ""Melt in your mouth, not in your hand because you can't keep the fork away from your mouth long enough"" type. I haven't said  this in god knows how long but, wowsa! The owner is great - you can just tell he really loves his job. My boyfriend said he would go back just for that. I would go back for the food too."
"Took the boyfriend here for his birthday and had a really great experience.  I love the atmosphere and how friendly and welcoming the staff is.  I love that it's really intimate and dark and even that the tables are close together.  BYOB is a huge plus!  The music choice is...odd, to say the least.  It was like early 90s dance music when we went?I'm sure hee would give this place 5+++ stars, but I have to give it four because it is not vegetarian friendly.  I'm not sure if they will prepare special vegetarin entrees...and actually the cous cous entree is fabulous.  I just would love more options especially when the carnivorous boyfriend is drooling over everything on the menu.And....Best. bread. pudding. ever."
"Good for groups: NO! I'm a bit confused why when we called for a reservation of 6 they told us they can't sit any groups larger than 4 together.  Then half the girls here overrated it because they were allowed in as a huge group for GNO.  Was the person on the phone mistaken, do they just play favors?  They even went into details saying their kitchen isn't large enough to bring out food for 6 people at once.  Uhh, OK.   (And it's not like they said they could only do a group as a walk-in vs reservation.  And we were flexible, we could have moved the time earlier, possibly another date, gone in knowing we needed a little more patience, ordered family style, etc).  In the end we only ended up with a group of 4, but partly because we didn't go out of our way to invite more people knowing this would have been an issue.When we showed up to see they had a pushed three 2-tops together for a group of 6, I was less than excited. Disappointed would be a better word. And I'd probably not recommend HB again because of it (as I've done countless times prior).  There's nothing more annoying than a place that pretends to have some policy then doesn't follow it. Then on a subsequent trip, I went with a group of 10 and somehow we were OK to sit down together.  WTF HB, not cool.Anyway... onto the food ...It seems that their menu has gotten a tad more expensive since when they opened (apps in the $11-13 range, most entrees in the $18-25 range).  I'd still call their menu some sort of French country Canadian thing, perhaps Dutch, it's a very nice menu that's a bit different from the norm.For appetizers we had a herring special they had and escargot.  The escargot was very earthy... definitely not your French grandma's garlic butter escargot.  I'm a big fan of their Haloumi as well.I debated between the quail entree and the flank steak, and the waiter talked me into the steak.  The pre-cut-up flank steak is served with a blue cheese risotto.  The steak was good but the risotto was undercooked.   I still ate it though.   And I could be crazy but I think there was supposed to be side of some onion or tomato but there wasn't.For desserts we shared the chocolate cake and some custardy thing.  The waiter poopooed on the chocolate cake and suggested everything but it, though it turned out to be our favorite thing.4 entrees, 2 appetizers, and 2 desserts came out to be $140+tip.  Yup, their menu has definitely gone up in price a bit... but still not bad by any means.Service was good.  I'm not sure I'd rely on the waiter recommendations as much as we did.Reservations are pretty much required here, and several times now I've tryed calling day of and they were completely booked, so I would even say ""advance"" reservations are required."
"Dear HB,I hate you.  You left me dreaming about bacon, dates, and brown sugar.  And then there was the bread pudding.  I really thought I had tried the best bread pudding ever until I had yours.  Now I'm ruined forever.  You hear that?  Forever!Don't think you can make it up to me by parading Chef Joncarl out to greet my big group of lovely Yelpettes.  You treated us like royalty, but I see right through your tricks.  I'm also onto your scheme to keep me buttered up by letting me BYO and drink as much champagne or wine as I want.  Transparent.  You almost had me with soft lighting and a warm ambiance.  Oh yes, and the Miss Piggy quote on the wall.  See, now I'm thinking about your bacon temptations again.  Fine, I know it's useless to resist.  I'll be back with my favorite BYO and a hot date on my arm.Mmmm...dates....Dammit.Love,Kellie"
"GREAT FOOD! (Everything looked good on the Menu)GREAT SERVICE! (Friendly, fun, cool)TOP NOTCH!!!"
"HB is an eclectic mix of ambiance and food.  The service was good, after a small confusion on who was our waiter, it is a BYOB, which adds an automatic star, and prices were reasonable.HB loses a star because I wanted to like the food more than I did.  I got the Lamb Burger which was overly salty.  After dissecting the burger I found the salt coming from the brie cheese.  The salt made it hard to eat.  The truffle fries were different and very good.  They were cooked crispy and came with a garlic aioli.  My wife got the chicken which was good.  Again my expectations were higher than what was delivered.  I would definitely go to HB again and try more of their menu."
"We came here on a weekend night without a reservation... That was a bit of a long shot, and sure enough the place was pretty much full. The manager was about to tell us to come back some other time, but ended seating us after all, if we agreed to be done in under an hour. Deal.The food is American, and I must say pretty good. We started with a smoked trout salad, which was delicious. Followed by two of the specials that night: a whole fish, and stuffed quails. The quails were absolutely delicious, and I'd go back just for them (though I don't believe they're on the regular menu). The fish, however, wasn't that great: fresh water fish, which should have been expected given that we're in Chicago... it was way too big and a bit bland: not great (and that's coming from someone who loves fish, and especially whole fish). Nevertheless, the food was very good overall, and I'll be happy to go again.To boot, the service was very friendly, and they're BYOB (go to the wine store down the street for a good and reasonably priced bottle): now that's a big plus in my book."
"Warning: This review is majorly influenced by the GNO (Yelpettes out on the town!) last night. Oh my stars & stripes what a wonderful time was had by all the lovely ladies of Yelp last night at HB. I could not have imagined a staff more accommodating that the ones at HB--seriously folks they were amazing. Although, I have to blame one of the servers for making me get up & go to the restroom a billion times last night--he kept filling up my water glass--thus making Mandi say I had a childs bladder :-) Let's talk ambiance--if you are looking for a romantic place to take that special someone, look no further. The warm hues, candles, dim lighting, and cozy seating make for some uber romantic tones (hello date night!). The space is also very intimate, so you will not be drowned out in your lovey dovey chit chat by large crowds (unless of course there is a GNO going on). THE FOOD--my word it is extremely (trust me I rarely use that word) tasty. The highlights for me--the bacon wrapped dates--like eating delicious candy.  I have to say the brown sugar they put on top is not necessary.  Also, the pinapple bread pudding---oh lordy--DELICIOUS!We were treated to the delights of a prixe fixe menu of: starters...choice of... ARTICHOKE AND EDAM FRITTERS with a roasted garlic aioli ALMOND STUFFED DATES, wrapped in bacon and baked with brown sugar MUSTARD CRISPED CRABCAKE on a white cabbage salad with old bay tartar sauce BROILED HOLOUMI CHEESE with rose petal jam and rye crisped DUCK AND TRUFFLE MOUSSE PATE with house made pickled vegetables, dijon, rusks mid-course a mixed green salad served family style then..main course choices of SLOW COOKED MOROCCAN STYLE CHICKEN COUSCOUS with root vegetables, spinach, savory broth WILD MUSHROOM RISOTTO with crumbed goat cheese, roasted tomato, truffle CIDER BRINED LOIN OF PORK on red potato au gratin with braised collards, sauteed pears, toasted walnuts SAFFLOWER RUBBED SALMON FILET on creamy polenta with roasted asparagus and a tarragon pesto SHELLFISH CHOUCROUTE (our house specialty)...housemade saurkraut, with smoked sausage, tiger shrimp, mussels, and clams over mashed potatoes dessert... CHOCOLATE CHOCOLATE CHIP BUNT CAKE GOOEY PINEAPPLE BREAD PUDDING with candied macadamia nuts BLOOD ORANGE CREAMSICKLE MOUSSE Of course there was lots & lots of sharing going on and that was greatly appreciated--it was wonderful to try all the different options. I would like to add that the portions were generous & the quality was superb. I tried pretty much everything & found fault in nothing. A word about the Staff & Chef, they could not have been more accommodating, friendly, useful and all around wonderful if they tried. You can tell they love what they do & they believe in the food they put out. The Chef came out a couple of times to make sure were okay & that my friends is QUALITY! So all in all--GO NOW!"
"Every once in awhile you stumble across a restaurant that you can't wait to tell your friends about, a restaurant that you leave feeling as if you may have just had the perfect meal, a restaurant you will return to again and again, and as soon as possible, because it was just that good. HB is one of those restaurants. From its cozy atmosphere created by the antique mirror-adorned wall, beautiful photography by owner and head chef JohnCarl, and makeshift candleholders made from wine bottles left behind by past BYOB diners- to the cheery, accommodating, and just plain cute staff- all the way to the perfect food that I am already craving- HB is a true gem.My two girlfriends and I decided to give it a try after the rave reviews we read on Yelp, and from the moment we stepped out of the cold and into the dimly-lit, bustling atmosphere of HB we were glad we had come. The staff, who had already told us that there would be a wait over the phone, apologized profusely for making us stand, uncorked our BYOB bottle of wine, served us and made small talk while our mouths watered over the food we could see and smell being served around us. When we were seated no more than 10 minutes later, we ordered the pork with au gratin potatoes and collard greens, the lamb burger, the mussels, and two heaping plates of (to-die-for) piping hot truffle fries. All three dishes were mouthwatering and comforting. My friends and I agreed that it was great value (Entrees between $15 and $24)- and a great spot for a group of friends, a first date, dinner with parents or practically any other occasion. Loved it. Can't wait to visit again. Will be back soon!"
"I went to HB with a few of my friends for my birthday a few weeks back.Every single entree was spot on!  By the end of the meal we were all deliriously happy.Even now, reminiscing about my dinner inevitably elicits a sort of Pavlovian response.... mmm.....Seriously you guys, this place is all that and a bag of crisps."
"Ah-mazing!  We went on the recommendation from a friend, and made a very last minute reservation.  The host was wonderful and got us in on a very busy night.  The food was tasty, interesting, but not too pretentious.  We liked the French influence in both the menu and the ambiance-- it's an intimate, but friendly vibe.  But don't forget to pick up a bottle of wine on your way in-- it's only BYOB.  Our server was FANTASTIC.  PERIOD.  She had a great personality, checked up on us often without being intrusive, and made sure we were enjoying the meal.  My husband's a hard one to please, but by the end of the meal, he was asking about returning the following weekend.  The host said that they also have a new restaurant in Andersonville, Vincent, that we should definitely try too."
"The perfect restaurant for my family to celebrate my graduation. I loved the atmosphere of the place, the staff was super friendly -- I had to push my reservation back a bit since we were running late and they could not have been more nice about it. In fact, when we arrived and while we were eating, the owner came over and said, ""Emma Olson, are you happy?"" I was so impressed with how easygoing they were.Of course, the food was delicious. The lambburger was excellent, the truffle fries were unbelievable, and there was plenty leftover for a late-night snack. My brother could not believe how good the Philly Cheesesteak was, and he tends to be picky with his steaks. Also, get the bacon-wrapped almond stuffed dates. Absolutely heavenly."
"The HB people could not be more welcoming or more nice to our GNO group.  When our group takes up most of your restaurant and you are still able to have great service... awesome.  I had the artichoke and edam fritters, the mushroom risotto and we all shared the desserts.  Those fritters were amazing.  So flavorful in a tiny little bite.  The risotto was delicious, albeit a bit heavy.  I almost wish I would have gotten the mussels special instead.  Luckily, I was able to try one of Amanda's!  The desserts were delicious as well.  I like pineapple but I would have never thought to put it into a bread type dessert -- it was so good!  The chocolate cake was a little too rich (can you believe that?) for my taste, but the blood orange creamsicle mousse was the best part.  I was almost tempted to lick the glass.Everything was fantastic.  Maybe it was the company of the rest of the Yelpettes or the food or it being BYOB?  I think it was all of the above.  I will definitely be back!"
"Not the most memorable meal I've ever eaten, but a solid one.  Friendly service, cute restaurant, good food.  If I were a Chicagoan, I'd return.  And I'm really starting to like this BYOB thing so many of Chicago's restaurants do.  I GET IT NOW.Appetizers: Artichoke and edam fritters were nice, but of course they were, they're fried.  Baked haloumi with rose jam, green salad, and rye crisps was ok, but you really have to eat everything together in just the right proportions.Entree: I was waffling between the trout and the skate, and my server unreservedly told me to order the skate.  For some reason the skate is not showing up on their online menu, which is a shame because it was pretty good.  It was served in broth, over polenta, with leeks and a little bit of harissa.  These things make a wonderful combination.  The spicy harissa caught me off guard; I was not expecting spice with this dish, but once I stopped coughing I really appreciated having that little kick.My dining compatriots really enjoyed their meals as well, and we all left happy and full."
"We went here for NYE dinner to ring in 2010.  We called a couple of weeks in advance and they had plenty of reservation times available.  The place is freakin' SMALL and we we arrived there were already at least four tables worth of people waiting to be seated.  We all barely had anywhere to stand.  Finally after 30 min. we were seated. The service was really, really, really bad.  We sat there for at least 30 min. before I had to get up and ask someone to please get us water and menus.  I had to get up again 30 min. later to ask someone to please come take our order.  Thank goodness it is BYOB or otherwise we would have never gotten drinks.It turns out it was the owner who took our order and it was clear we were annoyed, and rightfully so.  He apologized and said a staff member had lost a family member that day so they were one man short.  He was very sincere and it is for that reason that I am not knocking off a star for poor service.From that point on the owner was very attentive and gave us a glass of complimentary champagne.  Really nice guy.  The food was very, very tasty.  I had these bacon wrapped figs that were awesome!  The mussels were excellent.  All of our meals tasted really good. I'd go back again."
"Wow, I am upping this to 5 stars immediately.  This was such a great meal from start to finish.  Read all the other Yelp January GNO for the story but WOW!  The blood orange creamcicle mouse will play a regular role in my sweet dreams until I get back for another taste.  Well done, HB.  Thank you!"
"Went there the other night with a group of 6 and the service and the food were outstanding!!  It's BYOB with no corkage, which is awesome!Food:  we started with 3 starters, which were a Gouda taster, Brandade of Skate Wing and A Braised Rabbit Risotto.  All 3 were very good.  For entrees we got 2 of each of the following: Lemon Caraway Amish chicken breast, 12 hour braised beef brisket and seafood muscle, oyster & shrimp special.  And for desert we got an apple crisp & brownie.  The brownie was one of the best brownies I've ever had.  Everything was delicious and I would absolutely go again.Reservations were very difficult because they only have about 10 tables so we had to eat around 5:30 which actually worked out okay because we sat there for about 2 hours, drank 4 bottles of wine and there never hovered over us to try to get rid of us.  With a party greater than 6 it would be pretty difficult to go but it's a great date place or a great place to go with a group of 6 or less.  Great food, pretty good price (not too expensive but not cheap either) & absolutely great find, thanks yelp!!"
"I hosted a private party at HB several weeks ago. From the moment that I first contacted Victor regarding the possibility of renting the restaurant until the last dessert, the entire experience was exceptional. The service was outstanding; the food exquisite; and the environment cozy. I would strongly recommend HB for private parties as well as daily dining to anyone who asks."
"HB is by far one of the best culinary experiences of my eating career.  Joncarl Lachman, chef extraordinaire, knows what he's doing in the kitchen.  The highlight of my food was just that, the food.  It was the kind of food you don't forget.  I've actually had dreams about it.The atmosphere of HB has is equally as amazing.  Low light, great music (thanks Bob) and fabulous design.  It's a perfect spot for any occasion.  There aren't enough stars on Yelp to give this wonderful gem an accurate rating.   Thank you HB for the love you put into my belly on that magical night at your table."
"The atmosphere at HB is so good, that you really can't dislike being there. From top to bottom all of the servers and waiters were extremely pleasant, helpful, and just plain friendly. That alone made dining here a great affair. The prices are decent for a pretty good amount of food. While our food was clearly over-salted, we still enjoyed the amish chicken and coriander salmon. It was cooked well and had some good flavors. The fritters were a meal in themselves, but they tasted a bit too deep fried. Oh, and don't forget this place is BYOB!Overall a great little BYOB bistro run by great people, but the food won't overwhelm you in amazement. I'll be back sometime though."
This place was SO hyped up... maybe that's why I was initially in denial that the food just ... wasn't... that great.  The staff was so sweet and friendly and knowledgeable and the decor is lovely.  But what really matters here?  The food.  And it was just... okay.  Highlights include the clam chowder and brioche bread pudding dessert. Not-so-great were artichoke fritters (because the flavor of the artichokes was drowned out by the cheese) and the smoked duck sausage.
"When are they going to allow half-stars on Yelp?  I think HB deserves 4.5, but I'll give it 5 to help counterbalance the 4-star reviews (shame on you!).My parents surprised me with a visit yesterday (Saturday), so I scrambled to find a new place to eat ... aka opened up Firefox and typed yelp.com into the url bar.  HB was the first ""$$"" restaurant to catch my eye.  I called them, the very friendly host answered, I asked if I could do a reservation for 3 between 5-6pm (parents are on Eastern Time), and we were given a spot.Everything about the restaurant was great.  I had only read a few reviews before heading off to dinner, so I hadn't heard the stories about the bacon-wrapped stuffed dates; I consider myself lucky that we ordered them, because they were AMAZING.   Being raised Jewish, I can tell that whenever I see a pork product of any kind on a menu, I make sure to go out of my way to order it, so I can satisfy my forbidden love.  To sum it up, I needed a cigarette after inhaling this dish ... and a new pair of trousers.We also ordered the baked haloumi cheese app, which was also very tasty (the rose petal jam really makes it shine).  For an entree, I ordered the braised veal shank, which was friggin' awesome.  I'm not sure why I was supplied with a knife, because I never needed it.   My parents ordered the salmon (which I tasted, and was cooked perfectly), and the scallops (which were gigantic, and also awesome).  I didn't have much room for dessert following the feast (and the 720mL of Hitachino Nest White Ale that I had already downed), but I remembered someone mentioning the bread pudding on Yelp, so I ordered it.  It was apricot bread pudding.   I haven't had many bread puddings in my life, but this one was great!  I'm not sure how to describe it, but it was the perfect, light, fluffy dessert to compliment the prior courses.   I hesitate to say it, but the pudding kind of reminded me of fluffy buttermilk pancakes and syrup... in a good way.All in all - great restaurant experience; definitely worth going back to, multiple times.  The staff is amazing - charming, knowledgeable, and attentive.  There are just too many items on the menu look too delicious to pass up.  A+!"
This is truly a little hidden treasure on North Halsted. The room is decorated in dark colors and vintage mirrors. Mixed greens in balsamic dressing and specialgazpacho with corn were large and pleasing starters. The Amish chicken breast with pasta and asparagus was crisp and juicy. Pork tenderloin consisted of two large boneless chops on a bed of au gratin potatoes. Yum! Service was excellent and friendly Chef Johncarl is happy to meet diners. This is BYO so bring your best vintage and enjoy an excellent meal.
"I can't believe I haven't reviewed HB before as I have been several times.  I don't want to rehash what the others have said so I won't.First off, its an intimate space with decent spacing on regular nights.  Service is generally very friendly and helpful.  Menu is well rounded and always has something divine on special.  Always a meat, fish and vegetarian entree  to please even the pickiest of palettes.I love the no attitude BYOB service and the overall charm of the place.  Music is always just the right level, however, unfortunately for the other diners, our group of twenty screechers caused quite the din last night.The pork loin was fantastic as was the crab cake appetizer, the bacon wrapped, almond stuffed dates and the fritters.  Spring mix salad in a balsamic was simple and peppery and the desserts were orgasmic.  I am not a big dessert person, however, these were the exception and I tried more than one bite of everything.  I was torn between the double chocolate chip bunt cake with oozing chocolate and the pineapple bread pudding but then the blood orange creamsicle thing had to jump in to really sent my taste buds reeling.Wonderfully, homey little boite with excellent food and top notch service."
"All I have to say is that this restaurant has EXCEEDED every expectation I had going in. I knew it would be great, but as a self-proclaimed 'foodie', the food here was honestly one of the best I've had in Chicago! Perfect waiters and an exceptional array of chefs. Whoever invented the mint fettucine with duck is a genius. And the beef tongue, although I stayed a bit away from it, was met with RAVE reviews by my group. My favorite was the corn salad - a perfect mix of sweet, salty and spicy. HIGHLY recommend as a starter. the bacon wrapped dates, a close second -- delectible, yum!!!!!!!Treat yourself to this place. It's BYOB, cute, cozy, intimate, sophisticated, reasonably priced and REAL cuisine. The only downside would be the plug by the wait staff for the mussels - although good, they were too pedestrian for the 'real' food that was on the rest of the menu. The chefs are amazing and friendly as well. We had the pleasure of going back in the kitchen and thanking them. We met Victor (the originator of my favorite mint fettucine with duck pasta!) and he was more than gracious. I usually do not write yelp reviews, but this restaurant compelled me to do so because I was so surprised and pleased with the caliber and level of sophisticated that I was met with. Five stars. I could not recommend HB enough."
"I tricked my fincee into heading to Boystown to try HB and it was totally worth it. We started with escargot and crabcakes.  Both were delicious and well priced.  I had the beef pot roast and altough it's not the sexiest choice on the menu, it gave me a Disney moive 'Ratatoullie' moment.  My mom was a so-so cook but she made a beef pot roast that got all seven family members to dinner on time and this dish really sent me back. It was awesome. Just talking about it now makes my mouth water. Service was attentive and managed to walk the fine line between making me feel like an old friend instead of making me feel annoyed. And everyone loves a BYOB, right? I thought so."
"Great food and a very interesting menu. Wife had the lamb and I had the risotto. Also had a mussel dish for appetizer. All was a a great meal, wish they had wine not BYOB (becasue I'm lazy, OK?) but the owner/chef is great and very accomodating.Highly recommend to anyone in the city looking for something diffrent but excellent."
"This place is seriously awesome.  The staff is welcoming and helpful.  The food is top notch and the ambiance has a casual elegance, you can wear jeans or you can dress up and feel comfortable.  It's BYO which is always a plus.  We'll be back for sure"
"Home Bristo...A little gem in Lakeview (actually in the heart of Boystown) that unfortunately I visit only once a year. However, I do look forward to that visit once a year. It's usually around late June for my friend's (Brett) birthday. Even though the place is very small (or what people like to call cozy) it as lots of personality and cute waiters, plus it's BYOB. Food:I usally go with a big group so we get to try lots of the dishes a la family style. My favorite by far is the Sauteed Garlic and Escargot for starters and the Cider Brined Loin of Pork for entree. They have so many dishes that stand out because they do a great job of surprising your tatse buds with a mixture of sweetness and spice. However, I highly recommend the two I suggested. Service:Staff is very attentive and friendly. I really enjoyed that they always kept an eye on the table and made sure if we needed anything they were available. BYOB:Best thing in Chicago. I'm not sure if they have a corkage fee, but either way go BYOB. You'll save lots of money in the end. Yippee for HB!"
It was really kind of a gross out. Mayo mushy sauces with flavor combos that failed in execution. And I'm quite adventuresome. the fritters were yucky as was the fried oyster balls were greasy.
I brought my cousin here for his bday meal and he hated his duck/mint pasta.  I was so disturbed at his plate-hatred that I don't even remember what I had ordered. Sorry Cuz!  The service was great.
"Home Bistro told me subliminally to relax and I liked it.  One server, Mike, and a full dining room.  The owners here strive to give you an experience and they deliver.  We had an egg, bacon and caramelized cheese appetizer, the pate, and artichoke fritters.  For dinner we enjoyed the lamb burger cooked to a perfect medium.  Still BYOB after all these years with no cork fee.  What I really loved was the personality or the room and the people.  Our server was busy and took a little bit time to get to us.  When he got to the table he made us forget about it completely.  Really making our night in the end."
"Home Bistro (HB) is an aptly-named restaurant, because whenever I go there, it feels like home.  No matter how many outlandish, expensive, experimental restaurants I go to, I know that I can always come home to the elegant yet unpretentious confines of this North Halsted restaurant.The food is amazing.  Simply prepared, but nothing short of gourmet - I have never had anything that wasn't delicious.  This is a restaurant where you can tell immediately the quality of the ingredients: the fish is always fresh, the mussels never have that ""too much sea water"" taste, and their lamb burger is to die for.  Also, they always have at least one vegetarian entree on the menu, which is an added plus.  I have known several non-vegetarians who ordered the vegetarian options here just because they sounded so delicious (and they delivered on that!)!  And BYOB is always a plus.Service at HB is always friendly, always attentive (if you drop a fork, they've replaced it before you've resurfaced from bending down to pick it up).  They always make you feel at home, and do their best to get parties seated in their beautiful front window seating area.  My only problem with HB is that they used to do a WONDERFUL brunch, which they stopped serving.  Please bring it back!!!!!  It's the only reason I gave it 4 stars instead of 5!"
"I came here last night for the January GNO and I had a lovely time. Great company, food and wine were the theme here last night. Not to mention the awesome wait staff and the chefs. We gave the chef a standing ovation for his awesome menu, it was well deserved! For starters I sampled the Mustard Crisped Crab cake, Artichoke and Edam Fritters and the cheese plate. I was lucky enough to have the crab cake to myself. It was served with a cole slaw garnish and it was a decent sized crab cake. Very tasty! The fritters and cheese were pretty awesome too. For my main meal I had the Slow Cooked Moroccan Style Chicken Couscous. When my meal came out, it was piping hot and full of comforting aromas. Kind of reminded me of chicken noodle soup. Full of pieces of chicken, carrots, and of course couscous! I loved my meal and it was very fulfilling on a cold snowy night. I also tried the Wild Mushroom Risotto. This was very good but rich. It would work well as a side dish. I also grabbed a couple of truffle fries and those were phenomenal! Then on to dessert! I was extremely full but I managed to get in a few bites of the sweet stuff. There was: Chocolate cake with whipped cream, Pineapple Bread Pudding and Blood Orange Creamsickle Mousse. It was hard to pick a favorite they were all awesome. I loved the bread pudding the most. The grilled pineapple garnish wasn't bad either! The Creamsickle mousse was so light and airy. Never had anything like it before, I want to try that again! The chocolate cake was really good too. I loved my first GNO experience and couldn't ask for a better restaurant. Props that HB is a BYOB so that is always a bonus! Thanks to Brett for planning such a lovely dinner!"
"MMMMMMMMM! I love HB. For about a year, I walked by without even giving it a passing glance. I saw the light when some friends and I were looking for a BYOB for dinner. I've been here a few times and I'm never disappointed. The food is amazing--unique flavors, perfectly prepared--I'm drooling a little just thinking about it. I had this incredible salmon the other night that was like butter. Ugh! So good. I digress...Not only is the food amazing, the staff is incredible. ALWAYS happy, polite and helpful. The owner (Joncarl) can usually be seen on the floor, serving food, busing tables to boot!The atmosphere is quite cozy and intimate and the playlist is always bitchin'. My only issue with this place is that it's just the teeniest bit loud so you kind of have to yell to have a conversation. Definitely make reservations. This place is always happenin'! Don't just walk by HB anymore. Stop in!"
"We went back to HB last month and again- a great meal. We started off with the pate plate with homemade mustard. It was WONDERFUL. We also had the crab basket starter which we didn't realize was just a crab cake. It was a good crab cake but we felt like we wasted an appetizer (wish we would have ordered something more fun)- I can get a crabcake out here in the burbs.For dinner- I had the brisket cooked in Dr Pepper topped with homemade slaw over potatoe puree. Wow. I've never had brisket like this before. they must have slow cooked it for days! My husband had the pork belly dish which was great but the brisket was a knockout. Again- had to have the bread pudding dish this time with lemon sauce. had an ""o"" face while enjoying!!!"
"If it weren't for all the hype, I could see this getting three stars for average. But I took one away for disappointment. I wanted to like HB very much and you can tell from the reviews that we had every reason to expect a great evening. In fact, I would like to think that we could go back, but there would have to be two very big changes.Things started well. We had a reservation for 5 people at 7 on Saturday. We had none of the parking problems people talk about (no Cubs game?) and were seated immediately. The warm, family-level friendliness of the staff is all true. The appetizers were as good as promised in all these 5-star reviews you've been reading. Bacon-wrapped figs and chilled creamed corn/crab chowder are worth the trip alone. And the chopped salad was the kind of thing that inspires you to change the way you cook. For most of the food we had after that the creative combinations and flavors were pwnd by a ubiquitous combination of oversalted, overly buttered or oversugared. There was one exception to this on the entree list: the roasted vegetable couscous that my wife ate was light and fluffy and lightly but deliciously seasoned. My wife's comment--the menu was supposed to be seasonal, but most of the foods on it would have been better in mid-Winter than late July.But the killer was the unbelievable noise. When we arrived, the noise was high, but not painful or a complete obstruction to conversation. The music was stuff with words, a little danceable, maybe some Stevie Wonder if I remember correctly. It pushed people to talk loudly, but it was within the range of restaurant noise. Something happened at about 7:45. The tunes switched to all techno-dance and the volume doubled. Imagine being in a room 15' x 30' with no sound-absorbing padding anywhere, and professional dance-hall speakers in every corner rocking out at full blast. Now imagine you have your friends and family with you and you are eating duck with lentils or diver scallops and sun-dried tomatoes and drinking a bottle Chateauneuf du Pape which you've saved for tonight. Forget it.People around us screamed heroically across their tables, not seeming to mind this (made me feel old at 46) and we tried to keep up, but eventually our conversation dried up out of frustration. I suppose I could've asked them to turn the music down, but it seemed like this was the style of the place and even in the pauses of the music the conversation didn't somehow die back as you'd expect. We left without trying the amazing-looking desserts because it was simply too unpleasant to sit there any longer.Final comment: this is definitely an out-of-the-ordinary place with a creative force in the kitchen. But everything seems to get touched up by the salt,sugar, and grease gang before it gets to the table. Maybe in a different location and with a few revisions it could be great. But based on my experience I can't see going back. At any rate, bring earplugs or call ahead and ask about their plans for music that night."
"More like 2.5 starts....and I hate to say it, but I didn't find this place to be all that spectacular. This is nothing in offense to the restaurant, but the food was just ok. I'm not saying it was bad, just that I would rather spend my money trying other restaurants. My boyfriend and I went here on a Saturday night with another couple. We had a great table at the front of the restaurant by the main window. That was a plus. We had a couple of appetizers that were pretty good. I personally would skip the almond and bacon wrapped dates since they were not anything special, but the bread they gave with a special kind of sauce was very tasty. Drank some wine and of course ordered our meal. The waiter was pleasant and helpful, but I feel like he was a little too over eager whenever we asked him how a dish tasted. No offense, but you can't use amazing to describe everything and not get expectations a little high. My boyfriend and I were somewhat disappointed with what we ordered since we both got the same dish. It was the 12 hour braised beef brisket. It was tender, but the flavor wasn't really all that special. One of our friends did get the lamb phyllo dish and it was better than our dish. The fish and chips were another dish ordered at the table and our friend thought it was just ok because it wasn't what she was expecting either. I love food so I was very open and excited to go to HB, but in the end, I doubt I'll come back just because there are other gems to be tried in the city. It might be worth a trip for some, but maybe my expectations were a little too high and that's what hurt me in the end.  One of our friends did get the lamb phyllo dish and it was pretty good."
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago.  The staff is very nice, the menu is always changing, and the food is not normal.The only downfall is that if you want a quick meal, this is not the place to go.  Also it is small.   I could see how this could anger people.  With that said, everyone I have ever taken here has said that it was one of the best dinners they have ever had in their life."
"I really liked how laid back this place felt.  It was strange that the restaurant was so nice, appearance-wise, and yet it was also comfy, laid back and welcoming.  It makes a great date place in my opinion.  The staff were all dressed casually in attire that looked like what they probably wear when they're going out with friends.  They didn't seem to mind that my +1 was running extremely late, and they constantly came to see that I was happy with everything.  The owner also came to see that we were satisfied.On top of everything, it's BYOB, and they tell you that when you call to make reservations so that you know ahead of time to pick something up if you'd like.  There was no corkage fee either if I remember correctly.I left feeling like the cooking was incredibly similar to anything I might have at home, and at first this was kind of disappointing 'til I remembered that it was the whole point.  It definitely is home cooking, and I guess delicious with that said.  The only thing I didn't care much for was the dessert.  I had a bread pudding.  It was WAY too rich and there was nothing particularly good about it.  It also tasted a lot more like American Dulce de Leche desserts than it did bread pudding, and I really like bread pudding."
"I am Fussy Frannie, but last night's feast made me Placated Patty.  As part of the Yelpettes Girls' Night Out, I got to try many of the dishes (I love sitting with sharers!).  I had the almond stuffed bacon wrapped dates which were very good, but I agree did not need the brown sugar.  The crabcake with slaw appetizer was also delicious, but the hit of my entire evening I think was the artichoke and edam fritter served with garlic aoli.  I only had one, but I will dream about it until I eat one again.  I am not normally a big bread fan, but the bread they served in balsamic was amazingly addictive, and I couldn't help eat a couple of pieces, it was just that good.  The middle course of mixed greens was nothing to write home about, I didn't really need it.  Next up I had the shellfish charcroute, which was shrimp, mussels, a clam, calamari, sausage, mashed potatoes, and sauerkraut in a broth.  It sounds strange, but it was so good, and the portion was so large I took half home.  I also tasted the wild mushroom risotto, a bit heavy but also quite enjoyable, and the truffle fries (yum).  The chocolate cake and pineapple bread pudding desserts were okay, but for me the hit dessert was the blood orange moussicle, heavenly light and I could have eaten it for days.The service was excellent, and the chef could not have been friendlier, coming out and speaking to us, and then chatting with me for a minute after the meal.I would definitely go back."
"Cute little restaurant with BYOB. We had the bacon wrapped dates and artichoke fritters as a starter, which were both tasty, but I would have to say the dates at Avec are much better. However, my sturgeon entree was outstanding. I highly recommend you to try this dish! We also shared a  cranberry bread pudding, which was great as well.  The service was a little slow as the host was also our waiter, and there was only one other waitress working. There are other things on the menu I want to try so I'll definitely be back again."
"I had read the reviews and my friend said - Wednesday night is prix fixe for $29.00 (3 course meal - with a couple of exceptions and even those you can have but the cost is $35). Well, let's just say that on Thursday morning, I am still full and had dreams of a wonderful meal last night!!!!Wendy and I split everything - to start we had the Artichoke & Edam Fritters and the Escargot (give them a 4 star - have had better). Round 2 -Watercress & Smoke Trout  (both of us had this). Entree's - Mussels (the biggest bowl you have ever seen) and Pork Loin with potatoe gratin (this was heavenly)!!! We had to add in their Bread Pudding with a caramel sauce - this topped off the best meal!!!This is a true local gem!!! Meeting friends, date, special occassion - what a great space. Small and intimate (would not recommend for large parties), BYOB - yeah!!! Reasonably priced and fantastic service - yep did I mention how wonderful the staff was??? Our server made great recommendations and everyone was so friendly!"
"I had a wonderful meal at HB with a large group, which can be difficult to accomplish. Even in the small space of the restaurant, the group was seated in a way that gave us a little bit of privacy from the rest of the crowd, and the service was no less attentive (one waitress even sat down with my vegan friend to discuss her special menu). They get major points for their BYOB policy as well.As for the food, my only complaint is that some items were overly salty, including the polenta that was served with the rabbit entrée. The bacon-wrapped dates, however, were a little explosion of heaven in my mouth, and a definite crowd-pleaser as well.I'd love to try HB for an intimate dinner soon to compare the experience, but overall it was a good choice for a small group event."
"SO happy with my meal at HB.  Started with the fritters-- my friend called them heart attack comfort food at it's best.  They don't jump at you, just warm and cozy with a bit of crunch.  Delicious.   I had the salmon and it was so delicate and flavorful and light I couldn't stop eating it.  YUM!  My friend had the veggie dish with big cous cous (can't recall their name for it) and it was more savory and acidic--- perfectly balanced and flavorful. Also incredibly delicious and a great complement to the salmon.  We shared everything.  We'd brought a great wine to share and it went with our meal perfectly.  Too full for the bread pudding but eager to go back to try next time. May go on a Wednesday for their prix fix but HB is already so reasonable and regardless of price, so delicious.  One of the best meals either of us had in a long time."
"I have been wanting to try hb for a very long time but it's not close to where I live and I rarely venture up that way.  Well, I finally found myself up north and close enough to try HB and it was so worth the wait.  For apps we had the almond stuff dates wrapped in bacon, and let's be honest, anything wrapped in bacon is awesome.  We also had the crab cart...it was like a blue crab cake only baked in a tart pan. Both were delicious.  I had the chicken in phylo dough which I was hesitant to order but the server said it was one of his faves.  It was really good.  The phylo dough was perfectly cooked and spiced to perfection.  The husband had the beef stew which was so yummy and tender.  We really wanted the chocolate dessert but of course they were out of it when we were ready to order so we settled on the appled crirsp...perfect fall dessert. HB is byob with no corkage fee...the restaurant itself is very smalll and perfect for a date night.  We had a reservation and were seated right away.  I usually get to a restaurant and know what I want to order, making a decision here was hard...everything looked so damn good!!"
One word OUTSTANDING ..   the staff and food are a benchmark for dining experience in Chicago...  a must go..
"What can I say about this place?  HB is in my top 5 favorite restaurants in the city.  The atmosphere is intimate and lively at the same time - perfect for a date, to bring your parents or come with a group of friends (I've brought all of the above and they've loved it!).  As for the food, there a couple items on their menu that I crave on a routine basis.  The almond stuffed dates are amazing, LOVE the truffle fries, and their seasonal specials are great.  They served a rabbit stew / soup (I can't remember the name, something German) once that was so good I was practically licking my plate clean.  Just writing this review makes me want to go..."
"Excellent food, very friendly servers, BYOB :))Great, cozy place for excellent dinner.  you won't be dissapointed.  pre fixe wednesdays.....damn!  5 minutes away from our place...we are so lucky!great atmosphere, very relaxing"
"Oh my goodness. I don't think I have ever had such a great overall dining experience than at HB. Let me just start a list why.1.The host was so awesome! Though our reservation was at 8:30 we weren't seated until 8:45 because they table before us hadn't left. You could tell that the host was genuinely apologetic for it. We didn't even mind, yet he offered up many apologizes and even gave each of all 6 us of a glass of champagne on the house! But it didn't start there, when making the reservation the week prior and getting that call confirming the reservation the host (I am pretty sure the same guy, and as the reviews below say part owner) was soo nice and polite.2.Bacon Wrapped Dates. YUM!!! These were amazing. You MUST try them!3.The server, like the host, was so fantastic! When my friend ordered a beet salad and I made a comment that I had never had a beet before he went back to the kitchen to get me one so I could try it. Needless to say, I thought it tasted like dirt, but what a kind gesture! I also ordered one of the specials (I can't remember the name, it was a long one, but it had mussels, clams, shrimp, sausage, potatoes, and sauerkraut in it) and I think he could tell I was a little apprehensive of it so after I had tried it he specifically came over to me and asked what I thought. How nice!4.Truffle Fries! 5.BYO! And no corkage fee! How great is that!?6.The lamb burger. MMM MM MMM. This was so juicy and huge too! AND it's on a pretzel roll!7.DESSERT. After our table of 6 had gorged ourselves we decided to get one to share. We asked what the server thought was the best and he suggested this. It was delicious. It tasted like a stack of super moist, sweet pancakes, and everyone gave an orgasmic sigh after trying it.If I could give this place 10 stars I would."
"What a fantastic restaurant. We called on a Saturday afternoon to make a reservation for four. They asked for my number and promised to call back after checking the reservation book to see if we could be worked in. We were called back immediately and worked in at 8pm, as requested. Our waiter was amazing (Joncarl's partner, if I recall correctly). We ordered everything under the sun that has been praised in reviews; bacon wrapped dates, artichoke appetizer, truffle fries and mussels, flank steak with risotto, and the whole red snapper (which they even beheaded for my mother who could not stand the thought of the fish looking at her). After all this, we obviously had to have desert and the bread pudding was amazing!! I think it was key lime bread pudding...drool!! Sooo good. All this and BYOB-this place is great. Such a laid back atmosphere, but still very classy and we never felt rushed. The waiter even complimented our rendition of Taylor Swift's love story (I can't help it-I love it!)."
"I took my girl here for her birthday on Halloween night, right before the boy's town halloween parade. At the table by the window was a a group of rowdy pirates. A couple of risque poodles dipped in to rawkus applause. We also saw at least a dozetn cross dressing sarah palin costumes parade by the window.The place itself is very cute and cozy, with many small mirrors decorating the walls and low lighting. It has that dillapadated old home feel to it that I love so well.As for the food, the entrees were superb and the appetizers were average. We had the gouda cheese platter (which was served with matzoh, to our jewish hearts delight), and the salmon fritatta (boring- i'd skip it).As for the main courses, I we split the lamb burger with melted gouda (with a side of truffle-fries) and the moroccan chicken, which was one of the specials. Both were tasty and delicious, although both were very rich (almost ruining my after dinner plans for ice-skating).Another plus is the BYOB status (no corkage)- we saved a ton on booze, and the food's reasonably priced to boot. Our tab for two was about 60 bucks. So HB was great, and if not for the blah appetizers, it'd be five stars for sure. I'll surely be back, although it won't be quite teh same without the poodles!"
"Love, love, love this place!  I bring all of my out-of-town guests here.The host/waitstaff are always so friendly and so helpful with recommendations.  They even remind me when I make reservations to bring my own bottle of wine!Can't come here without getting the almond-stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates sauteed in brown sugar (can you tell how much I love them?!) and the artichoke and edam fritters.  These foods are wonderful!  And they always have the best specials.My favorite dining experience here was a few months ago.  Ordered the special--a dish of mussels, clams, and shrimp.  The dish came out without any shrimp on the plate.  The mussels and clams were awesome and when the server took the plate and asked how it was, I jokingly said, ""there were no shrimp!""  Two minutes later, the chef came out with a pan and dumped the shrimp from the pan straight onto my plate.  HB gets my highest recommendation!!"
"This is probably one of my favorite places to go eat.  Whenever I have someone in from out of town, or the wife and I want a night out, I try to make reservations here.  The food is amazing.  I particularly like the edam artichoke fritters and the bacon wrapped dates they were serving  as an appetizer (not to mention the bread pudding they had as a dessert)  And my steak entree was really, really good.  Everyone I've been here with has thoroughly enjoyed what they've ordered.The service has always been excellent as well - very friendly, attentive, and happy to make suggestions.  On one occasion my wife mentioned how much she enjoyed one of the specials she had previously eaten here.  Though they didn't have it that night, the server said it had been a special the night before and checked with the chef who said he could get it for her.  On another night, craving something sweet, my wife stepped in to request some pecan bread pudding to go.  Since the normal servers were busy, the chef came out to greet her, said he was flattered that she liked it so much, and even though they didn't have the pecan style this evening he would add some pecans to the version they were serving for her.  It was delicious.  And finally, the BYOB aspect is really nice and a lot of fun.  Having Kafka right across the street is a perfect combination."
"I was going to give it 5 stars, but it was quite the trek from downtown (although worth it!)... other than that, the service was awesome, as was the food.  The mussels were phenomenal!"
Jon Carl and Bob are amazing  people and they bring it to HB.  This bistro is one of my favorite places to hangout and to eat...the ambience is amazing and the candles add a wonderful energy to your dinner. Everything is delicious and I mean EVERYTHING. Oh and David is wonderful too....he is nice to look at. hahahaThank you for having one of the coziest and most quaint bistros in the city. Christine
"I am happy to report that the owner, Joncarl, contacted me to apologize for my experience at HB. This just goes to show how hard they work to ensure customer satisfaction. I too apologized for not saying something immediately that night. But HB really does have a wonderful atmosphere and team that it can overshadow the food (bad or good)!!! I look forward to trying HB again and experiencing what it really is."
"This place is awesome!  Had always wanted to go as it's in my neighborhood and was initially owned by those Steve and Dan guys who won ""The Next Food Network Star"" (back in the days when the restaurant was called Hearty Boys and even though it's now Home Bistro, it is fabulously tasty with a great ambiance.  My husband and I went for the three-course, $30 Wednesday night prix fixe special and shared garlic and escargot, perogi, moules frites (mussels and fries), rainbow trout, Belgian homemade chocolate, and praline brittle.  Awesome stuff!  I especially liked the appetizers and desserts.  Great deal to put you in a good mood, especially on a dreary day.  Service was great too, even while crowded.  Go!"
Love love love! Great service and I have dreams about the dish with catfish and okra. Enough said.
"Yum yum yum.  I love places like this... a small yet eclectic menu of specialty meats and plenty of seafood choices.  The ambience is great, and best of all, it is byob!  The owners are so nice, and even the chef came out to mingle among the patrons.For appetizers, we ordered truffle fries with garlic aioli sauce.  Delicious and you get tons of it with the order.  We also ordered the artichoke and edam fritters, which were seriously delicious.  My dish was the baked grouper with clams, chickpeas, in a great moroccan flavored sauce.  The flavors are really great.  This is a place that uses fresh ingredients and lots of spices and herbs to flavor their food.  Most of the main dishes are twenty dollars, and this is actually a great deal for fresh seafood, great portions, and meats like lamb, duck, quail, etc.  It's really a great deal for the type of specialty dishes you get here.My fiance had the deep fried haddock, and although I'm not a fan of deep frying fish, this was delicious. It was not too greasy, and the breading was awesome.  Also, unlike many places that uses sub par fish when deep frying it, the haddock was quite delicious and of great quailty.  The haddock came in a little pool of split pea sauce. The combination of the flavors were quite genius.I didn't try the pork chops that my friend got, but it looked quite delicious.  We were all incredibly satisfied with our meals, and the experience was truly awesome.  It's been a long time since I have been to a restaurant that I found innovative, delicious, and a good deal all at once.  I'm so glad to have tried HB!"
"The food was really a 3.5, but feels good rounding up considering everything together. We had an 8:30 reservation, but thankfully we called in advance as our table wasn't ready until 9:15 (which in this case was fine because we were running late...but if we there at 8:30, a 45 minute wait, with no waiting area/bar, would have been aggravating). Once we were seated, service was very accommodating and quick. As they are a BYO, expect to bring your own booze (which everyone seemed prepared with -- including individual cocktail shakers at the next table). In our case they were nice enough to offer to run across the street to 7-Eleven to get mixers for the booze we carried along. For apps, we tried the artichoke/cheese fritters, which were heavy and dense, but excellent. We also tried the baked crab app, which most everyone liked. Both were generous and fresh -- neither the most healthy. For dinner, beef stew was had by two, and Moroccan style chicken in phylo by another (and the crab again by one). Both dishes were excellently flavored, but for the chicken, definitely be prepared for serious Middle Eastern seasonings.  The beef on both plates seemed like it could have spent some more time cooking as there was some toughness.  Otherwise, again, the quantity was generous, and the ingredients super fresh.As the truffle fries came highly recommended, we tried those, and they do NOT disappoint.  Nobody could get enough, and we had ask the server to remove them from the table as we would have kept going on the seemingly bottomless basket.One shortfall might be seen in the offerings for vegetarians, or for those that enjoy fish, as both seemed somewhat short in supply, but otherwise, this is a great neighborhood bistro, run by ownership that is eager to provide a gracious meal in a welcoming setting.  Then, getting out the door for $122 (for a party of four), got everyone to agree they would gladly go back to try some different things on the menu."
"My first experience with HB was when I took my girlfriend here on a miserably cold and snowy Tuesday night.  This place warmed us up and reminded us again why we live in Chicago in the winter time.  The cozy atmosphere and delicious food was absolutely wonderful.  My girlfriend must have been looking even hotter than usual, because the waiters could not leave her alone.  I have no complaints, because we had some of the best service I've ever received at a restaurant.  The moment either of our wine glasses appeared to be low, someone was there to fill them back up immediately.  It's no secret that you save money with BYOB, but I almost wet myself with glee when I got the check.  HB is one of the best values in Chicago.  My only advice is to bring two bottles of wine, because you'll want to stay here and enjoy the restaurant long after your meal is done."
I eat here every time I go back home to Chgo. If I could give these guys more stars I would! Fresh creative seasonal food! Everyone who works there is sweet and loves food.  It's Fabulous! BYOB.  Remember to pour your server a glass of the wine you brought-it's always nice to share!
"Ohhh how i love HB!  My partner and I just moved here this past September and stumbled on this place on a cold November night.  It was truly amazing and everything you would want from a 5-star neighborhood bistro.  Jon-Carl the chef does wonders with basically everything he serves.  A few of my favorites are the Ujitstimeijer (or some crazy name like that) which is basically brioche with egg, arugula, bacon and cheese.  It is SO delicous! Also wonderful is the whole fish, no matter how it's prepared that night, the mussels and fries, and basically anything he does with pork. And chicken.  Okay I can't think of anything bad coming from that kitchen. And Jon-Carl has a commitment to using local food/produce wherever possible which is really important to me.In terms of ambiance, we really love it - it's very warm, homey and comforting and to get that plus amazing food is truly a rarity. Another great perk - Wednesday night Prix-fixe menu - $29 for 3 courses and it's BYOB.  Such a great deal!"
"Intimate, delicious, well-decorated, and extremely friendly all accurately describe different elements of HB. Let me get one complaint off my chest: the music! Turn it down and suck out the clubbiness and we'll be perfecto!Nevertheless, the food was so great and prices so reasonable that the overly loud ambiance is certainly not enough to lose that star. I will admit though I haven't done the BYOB thing too much and it definitely fooled me into thinking the dinner was super cheap! Anyway, Cabsav and Carmenere paired well with all our foods.At a birthday dinner for my friend we tried the Artichoke and Date apps and Mussels, Beef Brisket (chef's special), Scallops, Trout, and Lamb Sausage entrees. The artichokes were fried, creamy, and delicious with the garlic aioli. The dates, heavenly, although my company told me Avec's are a league above. The gauntlet is thrown!While the mussels were mine I had a taste of everyone's mains, and each delighted my palate. After getting past about ten mussels, buried deep in my bowl I found the ambrosia broth of beer, butter, and whatever else goes in. Mussels soaked in this stuff were noticeably more decadent and while the first layer smelled and tasted SO good, those that were soaked were divine.Come dessert time we decided on one of each of the Pomegranate Bread Pudding and some Brownie-type dish (Churros?). I preferred the former but both were to die for. A bit of unexpected peanut butter flavor was in the brownies.Mayhaps my complaint on the sound is ignorant as HB is smack dab in Boystown. However loud and obnoxious a few of the tracks can get, all else is great."
"Mike's Hard Lemonade, Mussels, Hugs and Snails.All things that comprised of my delightful Thursday night. This bustling tiny restaurant ravished my taste buds and practically blew kisses with the service. My dinner companion and I brought a lovely white and red wine to pair with whatever we decided to ordered. And the staff was swift in bringing glasses and uncorking the wine.We had the almond stuffed dates, wrapped in the crispiest of bacon and then seductively rolled in brown sugar and the escargot. Escargot= Perfect texture and savoryDates= A pleasant surprise of the meaty and the sweet-y (hehe)Then onto our main entrees: The ""Amsterdam"" Mussels and The Pork Shoulder C-something.The Pork was a pulled pork dish over a bed a coarsely cut saurkraut with mussels on top. It was pretty heavenly. Like a German or Polish dish but updated and perfected.All this time the service was impeccable. I was not for want. And at the very end while we were swimming in the Chocolate Bread Pudding, the chef/ owner came over and offered us Mike's Hard Lemonade and apologized it wasn't exactly lemoncello but refreshing. And it was, just like the dining experience. And to really top it off, I got a hug from the chef. Here's not having to spend a fortune to be treated like king and eat like one."
This is a gem of a place.  The staff and owners were so friendly and accomodating.  We had some questions about an ingredient called Sunchokes and they actually brought one to our table and explained it to us in a super friendly and cool way.  The appetizers were all exquisite.  Everyone was happy with their meals and said they would return if given the chance.  I ordered something unusual for me and didnt not have the knock out experience others had but it is totally my fault for that.  Dishes were prepared and presented excellently.  The hands down winner for dessert was the berry crips with frresh ice cream - O.M.G  I could have eaten 2 of them!
"Finally tried this place after having it bookmarked for months!Made our reservation for a Friday night and headed over pretty early. Because parking is scarce with no valet, we were actually a couple minutes late. We had to wait a few minutes for a table which isn't a big deal, but since the place is so small, if there were more than the two of us standing at the hostess stand, it would've gotten very crowded. It seemed like we kind of got lost in the bustle of the night. There appeared to be two servers, both who were incredibly nice, but we were often overlooked. I'm sure this is a rarity, but again, I'm reviewing on the experience we had. I love the atmosphere of the place, tiled mosaics and fun food quotes bordering the ceiling. Though it's small, you don't feel like you're sitting on top of the table next to you and it didn't get too loud. Perfect volume. We were seated and after 15 minutes of confusion (I think each server thought we were taken care of by the other.), someone came over to give us glasses for our Belgian beer. We had to ask about the specials since I'd read they have great ones and none were offered to us (though again, our server apologized and said he thought the other server had explained them to us).  The specials sounded good, but we were already leaning toward some regular menu items.We ordered the almond stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates to start. They were good, but for all the gushing, I was expecting something different from the usual bacon wrapped date I've had at many tapas restaurants. They were tasty, though. We shared the mussels with truffle fries and the pork loin. Another quick note, we never got napkins or silverware either, so had to ask for that after our food was brought out.The mussels were great. Not fishy at all and there were a TON of them. There had to have been 25-30 mussels in my bowl! Alongside those tasy mussels came the most amazingly addictive truffle fries. I made the server take them away because we were stuffed, but half of the giant bowl was still left! I would go back just for those.Despite the appeal of the truffle fries and the mountain of mussels, the pork loin was my favorite dish. It was served with a cheesy baked scalloped potato side and spicy, mustardy collard greens. Everything was topped with baked, spiced apples that were heavenly with the cheesy potatoes and the tender, moist pork. We were too stuffed for dessert because this is truly a place you won't leave hungry. The food was 5 stars, but the service was a little sketchy for our experience. We were often overlooked and had to wait quite a while to sit, for the menus, to order, then to get our check and pay. Again, I think this was maybe a fluke, and won't stop me from coming back, though it did make me knock off a star. Still, great, unpretentious food in a fun part of town. The BYOB aspect makes the meal very affordable and fun. I will be back."
"I loved my experiences here. Very quaint and cozy atmosphere. Our server, who served us both times I went, was awesome, very friendly and helpful (I wish I knew her name! She's great.). The escargot appetizers were delicious, very buttery and garlicy. The chicken liver pate appetizer is also quite good, but that's because I'm fond of liver pates....I realize not everyone might be a fan. I had the braised pork shank and it was seasoned and cooked perfectly. A friend let me try his mussels and truffle fries and they were both out of this world delicious. Another time, I had the fried catfish which was OUT OF THIS WORLD. I have daydreams about the catfish and the stewed okra. Drooling just thinking about it. I cannot wait to come back to HB, I could recommend this restaurant for anyone and for any occasion."
"I went here on a Saturday night with a large group and loved it!  I had to make a reservation a few weeks in advance and we also had to eat on the later side so that they could accommodate us.  The location is great, right in the center of Boys Town.  It's quite enough that you can have an actual conversation, even with a larger party.  And of course, it's BYO.  We had a bottle of wine per person, which may have contributed to my overall positive experience at HB.  The food was all great, large portions, and affordable prices.  We got the bacon wrapped dates (which I had to pass on) and the artichoke and edam fritters which were quite good.  For an entree I ordered salmon.  I know salmon can be a cliche thing to get, but this was truly awesome salmon.  It was cooked to perfection and came with a nice side salad that had some beets in it.  As I said, the portion was huge.  For dessert we split a few things including the bread pudding, a warm pear thing, and this chocolate bar.  I didn't really care for the chocolate and we actually didn't finish it because it was quite a large portion.  The chocolate was spicy and just not my tastes.  Overall a great experience, even for a large group.  The staff was friendly and the overall atmosphere was very inviting.  I love byos!"
"My experience at HB was wonderful. I went with a group of girlfriends for a birthday celebration and couldn't have asked for a better meal. As soon as we walked in the door, the owner greeted us and led us to our table. He was welcoming and warm. He even pointed himself out in the pictures on the wall. The service was flawless (I wish I could remember our server's name because she definitely deserves a shout-out...yeah, I said shout-out).  She was super helpful in explaining the menu and making recommendations. We were all a little embarassed not to know much about pork belly, but when we asked about it our server didn't judge us in the slightest. In fact, she said it was an excellent question because pork belly is always prepared differently at different places so it's good to inquire whenever you see it on the menu. She didn't even judge my friend for her terrible taste in wine (white zin). We ordered several appetizers, but one that really stands out is the rabbit risotto. Who knew rabbit tasted so good? For dinner, I ordered the brisket and it was phenomenal. Cooked to perfection, truly. In fact, every single one of us loved our meals. Dessert was, of course, incredible also. My favorite? The bread pudding. Definitely not something that I wanted to share with the rest of the table.I can't go back soon enough."
"HB was one of the best meals that we had during our stay in Chicago.  The food was excellent, esp the fried oysters, gnocchi and ceviche; the service was warm and friendly; and the atmosphere was fun, yet intimate.  We were fortunate to be one of the groups to enjoy the Wed prix-fix meal and of course we took advantage of the BYO.  There were four of us in the group and we purposely ordered different items on the menu and the only item that was disappointing was the Nilla wafer dessert...it was just pieces of chocolate and no Nilla wafers.  Maybe a mistake?  Regardless, everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meal and left the place happy and full.  Hope to come back soon!"
"I want to like this place so much.  BYO, intimate atmosphere, really friendly staff.  Unfortunately, the food is really hit and miss."
"Look at those ratings.  HB clearly does not need my help being total Yelp review rockstars, but they're going to get it anyways.I can say, without a shadow of a doubt, that I ate the best chicken dish I've ever been served at HB.  They had a special last Friday composed of a crispy skinned fried chicken quarter served atop Brussel sprouts, parsnips, and some kind of nut.  The skin of the chicken melted richly into my tongue with every bite and the vegetables were a perfect crispy, roasted, buttery compliment to this.Other fine points include the artichoke-Edam cheese fritters served with a mild aoli; delicious - I'd been eyeballing those from the moment I'd laid eyes on their menu and they lived completely up to my expectations.  More cheesy than artichoke-y, but this is not a problem; the flavor is excellent and goes well with wine, which with artichokes, can be tricky.Speaking of wine, BYOB.  I wasn't aware of this fact; I'd thought they just have a ""BYOB night"", but apparently all BYOB all the time.  This is a very, VERY good thing for the budget-strapped winegeek like the one I'm marrying; two bottles of wine with dinner here is less expensive than four glasses elsewhere.Also,.The server there was excellent; friendly, personable, interested in our experience and yet willing to give us space to revel in the dining experience.Which, by all statements above, was remarkable.  Almost as remarkable as that chicken. Cue the happy-delicious-memory-sigh...."
"I went here last night w/ a friend to check out Prix Fixe Wednesdays.  How can you top Prix Fixe AND BYOB on the same night?  You can't.The space was cute and everyone was VERY nice.  This is the kind of place where the chef comes out and talks to you if he's not busy.  Of course, I got what he recommended, the Chef's special, which was an African bouillabaisse, if you will.  It was really good.  My friend got the Pork Pie.  I know it sounds not so good but it was REALLY good.  They need to come up w/ a better name.The nice thing about the Prix Fixe night is that you can switch around, ie order an appetizer, a salad and a main course (skip desert) or get either an appetizer/salad, a main and then get desert.  It's nice to have that flexibility.The cesear salad had a little too much dressing for my taste, but it was good dressing.  We also ordered the artichoke fritters (yum) and the gouda tasting (also yum).  The gouda tasting comes out with fried bread.  Yes, you read that right--FRIED bread.  This restaurant is not kind to your waistline.For desert we split the bread pudding, which was REALLY good.  For those avid yelpers, you know I'm a stickler for service, and I will give it a 5 for service.  This is a place where you'll never have to ask for a water refill.  They are chatty if you want them to be, and very discreet if you are having a deep conversation.  I LOVE service like this.It only loses one star b/c there were no ""lite & healthy"" entrees...everything was very comfort foody but don't expect to eat lightly here!  We were sooooo full when we left."
"I didn't quite know what to expect on my night out to HB, and I'm so glad I had no expectations. It turned out to be one of the best meals I've ever had! HB just nails it, from atmosphere, to food, to service. Let's start with the restaurant itself, which is small and unassuming with about 20 tables, beautiful antique mirrors and quotable quotes lining the walls, and drippy wax wine bottles for candelabra in the back. Keep in mind it's BYOB. But the food, the food! It simply can't be missed. I don't think I'll ever forget those perfectly crunchy artichoke cheese fritters, the bruschetta with eggplant, roasted red pepper and feta, an amazingly fresh, uncomplicated salad, mussels and clams with a kick, to-die-for truffle fries, (although slightly intimidating) a whole steamed fish with littleneck clams, and finally tender, juicy pork tenderloin. Most unforgettable of the evening were the desserts that almost made me weep with happiness - bread pudding so good I wanted to rub it all over me, and sweet, delicious chocolate bark topped with sesame seeds. Heaven! If you're able to do a menu sampling like my group, I'd highly recommend doing so. We had a big (loud) group of community managers, lingering over dinner and conversation. Our servers didn't blink an eye - they brought out perfectly-timed plates, kept our glasses full and did it all with smiles on their faces. Kudos to you HB! I can't wait to try you again the next time I'm in Chicago."
"This was the first of three dinners my sister and her husband arranged when we were in Chicago. Maybe my expectations were elevated based on their ravings, but I was just not that impressed. I had a caesar salad for a starter, and it was pretty good, but a fresh caesar isn't rocket science. In contrast, my entree, a lamb burger, looked like it had been cooked in a rocket engine--it was charred to the point of unpleasantness on the outside, but almost raw and kinda falling apart on the inside. I'm positive I could've done better myself on my trusty Weber.Nothing else about the meal really sticks out in my mind, which is not a good sign... when I enjoy a meal, I tend to remember it in detail for a long, long time."
"Hand down one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago!!!warm and cozy atmosphere, extremely friendly, funny and knowledgeable staff, fantastic food (I dream about the fries), and BYOB = perfect."
I am so glad I found this place! Food is amazing! Service is amazing. I am a huge believer in yelp and this place was great! Make sure to make a reservation.
"This place was amazing! The food was perfect, the people were so nice, and the surroundings were great. Its a BYOB too, you cant beat that :) The owner/ Chef was very kind and was around to speak to if you needed anything. The bread you get is fresh and tastes great. This place is now on my top 5 places I could take my mom and a date!"
I loved every minute of dinning at HB. If I could give 6 stars for the people that work there I most certainly would. They were  terrific and so nice. The food was perfect and sooo scrumptious. The group of us could not resist all getting the lamb burger and it was massive but just delicious - I'm literally counting down the minutes until I can have my leftovers. I plan on coming back very soon and very often !
"Really great. really!The food was excellent- all familiar dishes but perfectly done and some really interesting flavors.  Nice to have bistro fare with some interesting flavors.  Tried 4 entrees, 4 appetizers, all delicious and different.Service is incredibly warm, friendly, fun, knowledgeable and so accomodating, but still not overbearing - perfect!"
"Yeah I'm a little late to the HB train but I'm on it now and there's no stopping me!A small group got together for a birthday dinner the other week and I must say, other than a few hiccups things were great. The two issues really shouldn't be issues but they are. I'll get the bad news out the way first. One, the wait time between apps and dinner and dessert were a little long. Not to mention waiting for the check. I was on a tight schedule so they split my check and let me pay but I know my group still didn't leave until 30 minutes after I had left. Two, my friend is a vegetarian and glutton intolerant. The staff was really great about helping her pick things she could eat and/or adjusting menu items so no complaints there but it would seem that if you were going to go through all that trouble you would make sure to bring the dish out correctly and not add the bread to the side of the dish. It was corrected immediately but it irked me. Finally, there is only one bathroom. This can create some chaos when the place is busy. No one likes waiting in line and no one likes you waiting in line right by there table when you are trying to eat.Now on to the good. I don't think I tried a bad thing all night. Luckily I went with a group of people that let me sample of their plates and I of course shared with them. Everything was fan-freaking-tastic! The mussles were to die for, the fried clams were melt on your tongue yummy, the cheese plate was delicious, and the truffle french fries were so good I think inhaled them. I'm sure I'm missing something but those the highlights from my meal. I'm pretty sure I should have been wheeled outta there after everything I hate.HB we can be friends. I'll be back soon and don't worry I'll bring the wine."
"Excellent food, great service, and a killer Wed. prix fixe deal.  Brought my dinner club here this week, and it was one of our best outings yet.  Thanks to other reviewers for the food suggestions - SO right about the lamb burger and truffle fries!"
"I'm adding a star since my last review because this place is just phenomenal. Called on Saturday for a table on Sunday - no problem. We ordered the bacon-wrapped dates again because they are just so darn good. We also split the escargot - not in butter and garlic sauce but in a kind of stew  - really delicious. For entrees, bf ordered the lamb burger, which was so huge he had to eat it with a knife and fork. I ordered the bison bratwurst (crazy, huh?) which was a special that night. Sooo good. Everything I've ordered here is fantastic. HB is a great deal - the food is a bargain for the quality and the presentation. And it's BYOB...can it get any better? Definitely check this place out."
"My lady & I headed over to Boy's Town to hit the Chicago Diner last Wednesday. At 8pm there was a 35 minute wait and we were impatient. I brought up Yelp on my phone to search for alternatives and saw that this spot -- right across the street -- had a price fixe special happening. I ran over to check it out. The interior was bustling, cozy, and candlelit with a nice vibe and and great looking food. I wanted in, and the nice front desk man said he could seat us because they just had a reservation cancel. He told me to grab my girl, a bottle of wine, and come back for a table for two. So I did, and we had one helluva pleasant evening. The food was great, the price was a smashing deal, and the service was very friendly. Great place for a weekday meal."
"The overall experience I had at HB deserves 5 stars. The food was really good. Can you find better food in Chicago? Yes! Can you find better food at that price in Chicago?No (well if you have please let me know where). My favorite dish was actually the dessert. It was brownie with sprinkled sea salt. I loved the combination of the wooyyy goooyyyy chocolate sweet goodness with the little salt and the cold whipped cream on top. Very simple, very good!!!The place is really cozy, private and comfortable. Our waitress was really nice friendly and helpful. Plus, its a BYOB, meaning you can enjoy good wine without paying 2x for it+tax+tip and you cant beat the Wednesday deal. I am so glad a friend recommended this to me!"
"I held a private party here this past monday.I planned it about a month in advance, with Joncarl the owner.Honestly, we did very little correspondence thru email and ended up having the most enjoyable party!About 25 people arrived to passed hors de oeuvres. Let me say, the artichoke edam fritters are amazing!We then sat and had family style salads and ordered our entrees. Our food was delicious! Oh and we had an assortment of desserts! i think it was an orange creamsicle mousse that was my favorite. We drank plenty of wine and had a great time!I had such great feedback from all the party guests as well!i totally recommend having a party here!Thanks again, Joncarl!"
"I hate to buck a trend, but I went for Yelp Eats with friends at the beginning of June, and I just wasn't as taken as everyone else seems to be.  The service was excellent - it was a very crowded Sunday evening, and one of my friends was running late, but they were nice enough to seat us and get us started with our wine and some bread even though we were just sitting there for quite a while.I had the edam fritters, which were great, but the portion size was a little crazy - I'm a huge fan of fried food, but four giant fritters was just more than I could handle.  I'm not one to complain about value for money, especially in a nicer restaurant, but a pile of fritters and a bucket of dates can be a bit overwhelming; if you're not on a three course menu, two people to one app is probably the way to go.  My salmon was fine, but outshined by the vegetables and lentils, and the bread pudding was good, but nothing I'd rave about.  The strange portion-sizing appeared again as my friend's order of warm chocolate cake arrived so large and so rich that even the three of us working together couldn't make more than a dent in the side.  All in all, I had a pleasant (if salty!) experience, but I just didn't see the magic all the other reviewers are caught up in . . . The pork with apples, however, recieved rave reviews from my friends who seemed eager to go back, so perhaps some entrees are just better bets than others . . ."
"This is one of the best meals I've had at a restaurant, ever. I think it might actually be the best. Seriously fantastic food. The atmosphere is really nice, warm and romantic. It's BYOB and there's a convenient place to buy wine across the street. They play kind of quirky music, but it's not too loud or noticable--I believe the Price Is Right theme song played when we were there? We got the Prix Fixe menu on Wednesday night, I believe. Three courses for $30--quite a deal for this caliber of food. They were busy, but as we arrived late we got seated right away. I'd recommend a reservation in general though.     I got the Cesar salad, which was great. Companion got the chorizo potato salad, which he liked very much. For the main course, I got the Coriander rubbed salmon with black eyed peas, watercress, pistachio, and charred tomatoes. Just remembering this dish makes my mouth water. It was phenomenal. All of the flavors together were perfection, and I swear to you I could eat a pound of those buttery, delicious black eyed peas. I can't even remember what my boyfriend got since I was so obsessed with mine! For dessert was sour cherry vanilla bread pudding, which was equally fantastic, warm, comforting, and delicious. I cannot rave enough--go here! Please!"
"Came here last weekend while visiting a friend in Chicago on a trip from NYC. We had the artichoke fritters and summer salad as appetizers and then I had the fettucini with duck...all the food was delicious and reasonably priced. Service was friendly and attentive, plus it's BYOB, which is a great added bonus. Atmosphere definitely leans toward romantic, so would be a really nice date place, but was also fun for a nice friends night out."
"Five stars...not just for food, which is at a nice price point and absolutely delicious but, for service. These guys bend over backwards to make sure you're happy. I have been there more than a handful of times and I guarantee that I will be back time and time again. My absolute fave is the bread pudding dessert. I literally get teared up when I eat it...so amazing.Thanks guys, you have a wonderful place! I love it and I let everyone hear about it too!"
"Everything was great!  BYOB!  Friendly service!  Heart this place.  MUST try the bread pudding dessert, it's outta this world!"
"Yep, great place. Fab. Grandiose. I was impressed by the simplicity of this place. Great service, pretty fast service with food as well. Overview of Sunday BrunchMy order: Chorizo, Fried Onion, and Blanco Cheese omelette.mmmm. Nice fluffy omelette with tons of chorizo, I got it sans onions because I don't care for them :) Lots of cheese, but not overly gooey! The chorizo was very prominent and perfectly seasonsed. Strawberry butter with a little biscuit and a few homestyle potatoes $10Other orders, compilation style:Sugar bacon with eggs, Matzo Brei, and the Tomato Basil, Mozza. Omelette. Everything was devoured. Great sized plates. $8-10The atmosphere was great, very quaint with good music. They even had a dessert menu for brunch! We were too full, sadly.I will be coming here a lot more often for dinner, too! Great neighborhood pick, nothing to complain about here!"
"Usually when a restaurant is described as ""American food"" I have my doubts, but this gem of a place was fabulous.  We showed up late without reservations and had to wait 15 min to be seated, but the host was gracious and opened our bottle of wine while we waited.  The chef is also a photographer and his photos adorn the intimate dining area and candle light makes each table romantic.  We started off with with fried cheese and jam which was ridiculously delicious.  I had a full fish, head and all, with andouille sausage and calamari.  It was decent.  My vegetarian gf had a leak and polenta dish...mouthwateringly scrumptious.   Dessert was a chocolate bread pudding that ended a perfect meal.  Make sure to get reservations!"
"I just cannot say enough good things about this place. Jonathan runs a great place and his food is tops. Can't beat BYOB either. Last visit I had the beef tongue sandwich, which was a knockout. Asked them to make it a regular on the menu. Jonathan himself waited on our table and he just makes for a fun night of dining. Chicago needs 50 more of him running restaurants."
"I don't think I can say enough good things about this place.  Ambiance is great, service is fantastic in a non-fake kind of way (you get the sense that they genuinely care about your dining experience) and of course the food is yummy.Also, our waiter was wearing an apron with a charming amount of food stains and various cooking powders--just enough so you know he's actually doing something in the kitchen, but not so much that you want to throw his clothes in the wash."
"Great evening at HB - staff was quirky, food was delicious, and there's a Ms. Piggy quote on the wall. I had bacon-wrapped dates as an appetizer and mussels with truffle fries for my entree, both were great. I wanted to try the gnocchi with wild mushrooms, but they had run out (our reservation was at 9:30). Not sure if I'll be back soon, but I'll recommend it!"
"Been here twice. The menu is quite creative and offers good variety, though the dishes seem a bit hit or miss. Artichoke and Edam fritters were perfectly cooked and had wonderful texture, but were short on flavor. Baked haloumi cheese had wonderful strawberry jam, though the overall dish is a little too salty (and I absolutely never find things too salty). The arugula/beet/stilton salad contains delicious, fresh arugula although the stilton was not real stilton.What are really wonderful are the moules et frites. I'd say HB's version is right up there with Hopleaf's. The broth is slightly less savory, and I really enjoy the touch of anise. The mussels themselves are fresh and very tender. The fries are up there with the good pommes frites I remember enjoying in France and the Netherlands (never been to Belgium). Moules et frites places in the USA usually give you the shoestring fries, though I've never seen these in Europe. The fries are drizzled with truffle oil and served with roasted garlic aioli. The portion they give you is huge and you will really have to cut yourself off to avoid consuming a delicious shitload of potato goodness.Buy yourself a good beer like Saison Dupont, Westmalle, or Karmeliet, come here and get 2 plates of mussels, and slowly wean yourself off of your hopleaf addiction."
"Lovely atmosphere, great service, chill place that is attentive to reservations - BYOB is a plus. Food was nice, kind of a mixed bag. I would give the restaurant 3.5 stars, if I could...We were visiting family and friends in Chicago and decided to check this restaurant out. The sweetbreads were lovely, well prepared. The ""pate"" was more like a cold, pressed loaf and not your standard liver-y smooth version of pate. For dinner, the pork shank was delicious, scallops delightful... trout was very simple and slightly bland and the braised oxtail gnocchi was VERY salty. Bread pudding was the best of the three desserts - the other two were a nice chocolate and the pear or apple crisp was typical, nothing outstanding."
"jimandbrittneyeatchicago…Home Bistro was our first go at the Á la Card deck we bought for ourselves as inspiration for the restaurants we'd be patronizing in 2009. Without going into too much of a sales pitch, let's just say this... 52 chef-driven, owner-operated restaurants, $10 off at each, and the deck cost us $30. That says it all, really.As for Á la Card, we say, ""So far, so good."" And we'll probably stop at good for HB this time around. The food was decent, with some high points here and there.We started with the escargot.I've been a pescetarian for less than a year, so I knowingly maybe-possibly-sort of-most likely broke the rules here. And I paid for it. The escargot had an almost gamey flavor, which I attributed to the broth. We ordered the escargot because Jim had never eaten it, and I was hoping it would come out in an escargot dish, all steamy and delicious. Instead, the presentation was only so-so, and the dish ended up a little too meaty and watery.For our second dish, we ordered a beet salad.We both love beets, love goat cheese, and love walnuts (so much so that we often include these items in our salads at home), but this salad almost missed the mark. It was over-salted and lacked something special or unique to HB. But with ingredients like these, it's hard to say it was all wrong. Again, a bit more finesse in presentation may have helped.Brittney's entree was a special that night, salmon on top of clam chowder.Attention Chicago restaurant owners, chefs, and staff: Add clam chowder to a dish, and I will order it. It was so obvious that this dish was one of the night's specials, as can be seen by the presentation alone. Although the goodness of the chowder overshadowed the fish a bit, it's hard to fault someone for phenomenal chowder. The chef took great care with this dish, and it paid off. It was special indeed.Jim ordered the pork.For dessert, we went with caramel bread pudding. The pastry chef was vacationing in Europe, so the only options that night were whatever the not-so-pastry chef could conjure up. It ended up being pretty tasty, but it's rare that either of us would have anything negative to say about dessert.The ambiance of the place was pretty great. The servers and chef appeared to be cut from the same mold. They were all burly men in flannel shirts, which likely serves them well in the heart of Boystown. Overall, the space was pretty quaint and dim. The candles were all lit atop old wine bottles, which was a nice touch.By far the best moment of the evening occurred when the music shifted from poppy-whatever to ""Jizz in My Pants"" by The Lonely Island. We were apparently the only diners listening to the music, because upon looking around to catch a few other smirks and giggles, we caught nothing! We either have impeccable hearing, are extremely immature, or are more in the know about pop culture and dirty SNL skits.You say I'm premature. I just call it ecstasy.Overall, we'd suggest HB to anyone looking for a good dinner in the area, but it's not at the top of our list to revisit."
"This is my new favorite BYOB. Candlelight and completely satisfying cuisine. This reminds me of a family-owned cafe in Tuscany where the owners cook, and come to chat at your table. Order the fish of the day for two people. It arrives as the whole fish, stuffed with fresh herbs. And, how many reasonably priced restaurants can you find in Chicago serving bouillabaisse? If you're looking to go Dutch, there's several good choices from cheese to main courses. And, apart from the food, and friendly staff there's a really talented photographer posting his black and white photography around the room. If you're a photo lover the bathroom is worth checking out."
"This place is a true hidden gem.  My husband and I have been here tons of times and it never disappoints.  We eat out a lot and at a lot of very nice restaurants all around the city and this is hands down our favorite spot.  The food is always great, the service is amazing and the fact that its BYOB makes it even better.  I would give HB 100 stars if I could."
"So, the staff and chef are simply sublime.  Wonderful, funny, and welcoming.  I ordered the whole fish special.  Tasty but overdone.  The presentation was over the top with sauce filling every empty space of the platter. The man had the lamb patty and loved it.  HB is not an intimate restaurant though the facade makes it appear to be as such.  The noise level is just terrible.  You'll literally find yourself shouting to you dinner partner and unable to carry on a decent conversation.  Sadly, though we had early reservations, we were given the worst table.  You guessed it.  Directly across from the entrance to the kitchen.  UGH!  The wait staff have no choice but to knock into tables and chairs since the seating is extremely cramped.Kafka wine store is directly across the street.  Bonus for a BYOB restaurant. Perhaps if we had had more to drink, HB would have been easier to take."
"HB: Home Bistro is the best dining experience in Boystown.  This review will describe my reasoning behind this.          1.  it's very easy to get to know each server, cook, host by name.  And they'll learn your name, too.     2.  while there are only a few vegetarian options for apps, and one or two in the entrees, EACH DISH IS DELICIOUS... especially the roasted vegetable cous cous-- seasoned with ras-el-hanout (mouth waters).       3.  This place makes their own mozzerella     4.  Every song playing during the service hours is perfectly picked, placed, and each song is awesome.  The price is right theme song played at one point for 40 seconds.       5.  The art on the walls is not only something to discuss during dinner, but it's something you might want to buy and put in your house.  Bob Moysan, one of the owners, does it-- and it's really inspiring and awesome.  Ask them about their cats.     6.  The sole female server is gorgeous and wears pearls.       7.  Every server is attractive.   And I don't mean boystown trash attractive, I mean truly attractive, hot, sexy, amazing, you want to be their friend attractive.     8.  The dessert is SERIOUSLY something to order.  You won't regret it.  I think we had chocolate bars with pumpkin seeds and cayenne pepper.  WOW.  I loved it.       9.  Joncarl Lachman's conceptualization of dutch, creole, and american food is authentic, innovative, and completely satisfying.  His tutelage to his cooks in the kitchen is stellar.    10.  The philosophy behind eating as an experience, socializing through food, emoting through dining, and eating for joy comes through here.          And, any Serial Mom or Mommy Dearest reference is always welcome here.  Bon Appetit !"
"I'd give HB 3.5 stars if I could.  Really wanted to like this place better.  So much to like.  The artichoke fritters were fab, as were the mussels. Pork on cheese grits was OK; not much flavor in the grits. The duck breast came with very tasty potatoes and mushrooms, but the duck itself was overcooked and pale, like it had been steamed rather than seared.  The watercress salad was very ordinary for $10. The deserts were rather disappointing: The brownie was OK, just OK and the apple pie pastry was pale and tough, more like a common diner version than from a foodie's haven. Do I sound bitter? I'm not. Just not thrilled.  Service was super in all ways.  Atmosphere was suitably loud and fun, as was, of course, the human scenery outside the big windows.  Come anyway, just have your expectations in order."
"Delicious! We really had a fabulous time at HB. The ambiance is great, service was wonderful and the food was scrumptious! Almond stuffed dates - melt in your mouth. Soo good! Seared diver scallops were absolutely amazing, but the highlight of the entire meal, dessert. We tried two, but the one that makes me want to visit this restaurant on a weekly basis was a special. (Sorry, I can't recall the exact name.) It's a caramel maple heaven! Can't wait for my next visit!"
"This place came really highly recommended, so my husband and I were really excited to try it last weekend. Unfortunately, we had a terrible experience. We had a 10pm reservation; arrived on time, and were seated at a table in the middle of the restaurant. Service was a little slow, but we had our wine and it was Saturday night, so that was okay. We ordered the escargot and the sweet breads to start. The escargot were a little rubbery, but the garlic-y tomato sauce it was served in was excellent - the best thing we had all night. The sweet breads were fine on their own, but the sauce they were served with was too salty and totally overpowered the dish. We ordered the beef heart and the pork and clams for our entrees, but our server returned more than a little while later to tell us that they were out of beef heart. They were also out of the oxtail, but they managed to tell us about that before we ordered (we were told that they accidentally left it out all night, which doesn't inspire a lot of confidence!). So, we got the quail instead. Both entrees were extremely disappointing. The pork and clams was basically a mound of vinegar-y pulled pork covered with a layer of powdered parmesan cheese, and a handful of dry, flavorless clams. The dish not only looked unappetizing, but tasted really odd - very salty and heavy. The quail was overcooked and tough, and the sauce it was served on was overly sweet and really grainy (this seemed like a technical cooking error) - really unappetizing. The worst part, and what made us put down our forks after only a handful of bites of each dish, was that there was hair in our food! Both dishes! Actually, that wasn't even the worst part. The worst part of the experience was that our server and the host, who I believe is the chef/owner, pretty much ignored us once our entrees were served. We sat, food untouched, in the middle of the restaurant, for about 30 minutes before our server came to check on us. When we told her (in a polite and diplomatic way) how disappointed we were with the meal, she apologized and quickly whisked the dishes away. She didn't offer to bring us anything else or show us a dessert menu (I was still hungry! It was 11:30pm and I had barely had dinner!). And then she didn't come back! After about 20 minutes, because we had to leave to catch a show, my husband finally went to find her (again, this is a tiny place). She told us that they would comp the meal, which we appreciated, but it would have been much better if she, or the chef/owner, would have actually came to our table to tell us that. Overall, I got the impression that once they knew something was wrong in the kitchen, or with our experience, they decided to ignore us. Whether that was because it's such a small place, and they didn't want other diners to pick up on it, or because it was late and they had pretty much given up on service, I don't know. Bad food is one thing, but bad food paired with rude, inconsiderate service is unacceptable. We will not be returning to HB."
i had a really good time here with my date.  The staff was attentive and courteous.  While waiting for our table they offered to chill our wine.  We both had the specials and thought they were delicious.  Would go back again!
"***I would come to HB any night of the week, not just on a Wednesday!***"
"I had an amazing meal here with friends, they the night I was there they had seasonal menus. I had bacon wrapped almond stuffed dates to start and they were almost to good to share with my friends. I had tilapia for diner that was really good,  all my friends loved theirs my buddy had the duck and said good things about it. Plus Byob keeps it to where you can order more food and save $ on drinks. All in all everything was super! homebistrochicago.com"
"Maybe I'm not enough of a foodie to appreciate the place. It was definitely good, but not quite worthy of the love Yelpers are pouring on it, in my opinion. The portions were a bit small and the food was very good but not great."
"*Sigh. Everything was just so good - so pretty and flavorful. My friend Soph suggested we try it and I loved it as soon as we entered the breezy and chic storefront. The music was good -- perfectly melodic and mellow to allow a smooth flow of inconspicuous conversation.  Our waiter was helpful and quick. We had the giant mound of mussels with a side of crisp shoestring fries,  a lightly seasoned  salad, and the succulent tilapia, topped off with a delightful bread pudding. Oh, the pudding, mum! We left bowlegged, groaning and teary-eyed with happiness."
Yummiest! Loved everything.  Portions are huge. The pork bellies where superb.
"sooooooooooooo good! This is a friend's favorite place and she brought me last Friday. Outstanding. We went right after work so it wasn't crowded at all, and all of the staff recognized my friend and treated us really well! I am not the biggest BYOB person, but in a fancy(er) place like this it makes alot of sense. We each bought a bottle of wine across the street and that really saved my tab from being outrageous.We split the fried oysters (which sat on a bed of creamed spinach with chili oil) and they were absolutely delicious. My friend ordered the pork knuckle pappardelle (which was very good) and I ordered the pork belly special. It was maple-glazed pork belly that had become caramelized/crispy in places from the maple, on top of green (and wax) bean almondine.  It was the best pork belly I can remember having in a while. Finally for desert we split the brown sugar bread pudding. I am a southern boy, and i usually don't like bread pudding because of the (actually i am not entirely sure), maybe the ingredients? BUT THIS WAS AMAZING. We debated on whether we should have ordered another bread pudding, we held off, but it was so goooood. Amazing food, not outrageous prices, fun location, great staff, good specials, cant wait to go back. Soon hopefully!"
"Outstanding in every way, every time! Shhhh...dont tell anybody!"
YUM - the special 1 rate deals that are available on certain days each week are TOTALLY worth it. You can sub out a salad for a dessert if you want. Everything at the table that we ordered was great. Try the bacon wrapped dates and really any of the entrees. SO good.
"What a wonderful hidden gem!  Been by HB many times and have had many friends tell me about it but last week I had the pleasure of trying it out for myself.  The decor is homey with wonderful quotes around the ceiling.  The food was great and you could tell that time was taken to create your meal.  I had the Baltimore salmon which had amazing flavor.  It's BYOB so stop by Kafka before hand and pick up a bottle, or two... I had the three course deal (not sure if thats only during the week) but it was only $28, when I added up what I got from the menu price it was almost $45.  What a deal!"
"I love HB, it's one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago.  The place has a cozy and romantic atmosphere and the servers are very friendly.  You would think a restaurant like this would be very expensive but the price are very reasonable and BYOB save a lot of money!"
"""Just so you know, we have another reservation coming in right after you...""Yeah, thanks.  I think I got the picture after our server AND the host came to our table less than 20 minutes after we were sat down to remind us that there was another reservation right after ours, so we would need to hurry it along.I made the reservation for 7:00pm.  We arrived at the restaurant at ten after.  As we walked up the steps, I was greeted by a phone call from the host wanting to know if we were going to make our reservation.  Ok fine.  A little strange (most restaurants hold a reserved table for a minimum of 15 minutes, but they're a small place, I get it).It was a party of 3 -- 2 of us arrived first.  We sat down and promptly ordered water and a cheese plate.  Our server asked us if the other member of our party was ""on his way,"" and then again a few minutes later if he was ""close."" We ordered something lady - relax - we just sat down.  This isn't a race.  It's a Friday night.  I know you need to turn your tables and make your money, but we're here to relax.  A few minutes later, a little before 7:30, our third guest arrived.  Before he was even seated at the table the server demanded he give her the wine to open, rattled off the specials, and asked if we needed more time.  Uh yeah, that's be great considering he just walked in and clearly hasn't looked at the menu.  But to quell her anxiety, I ordered another small appetizer which took at least fifteen minutes to arrive at the table. Between the time I ordered the app and it arrived the server came by and said, ""Just so you know, we have another reservation coming in right after you around 8:45pm.""  Jesus lady, we just took our first drink of wine.  Sod off, really.  But before I could get a second drink from my glass a scraggly, unshaven host appeared table side to tell us (yep you guessed it), the same damn thing.  I'm thinking do I have three heads, is there something gross on my face, what is it about our party that's so offensive to the restaurant you need to rush us out here?  Last time I checked I'm paying you, so back off already. We quickly ordered our entrees, despite my better judgment to leave the place right then.  Once the entrees hit the table, we sat out a second bottle of wine.  The server stopped to open it, as soon as she saw it of course, and that was the last we saw of her.  That's fine -- it was the best part of the whole evening -- there wasn't a hand on my back ushering me toward the door.  As soon as we slowed down with our entrees, surprise surprise, the check hit the table.  She didn't offer dessert or even check to see how the meal was.  We put our credit cards out, immediately of course, and the host / table siddler, appeared to and whisked it away.  We were only half way through our second bottle of wine.  After we poured the last of it, mind you it's a little after 8:30 now, the host appeared yet again and told us, ""We have a party that's been waiting over 20 minutes.""  What the f*#(@ -- it's a good bottle of wine.  You're a BYO.  Mind if I finish it?  Mind scheduling reservations with reality in mind?  Or just a touch of hospitality, since that IS the business you're in.  And the food, eh, it was decent.  The Amish chicken was good, the risotto underneath was watery and bland.  The Spiced Lamb Pie... well it was alright if lamb is supposed to taste like my working mom's crappy meatloaf topped with cheap ricotta.  And finally, the trout... well the fish was good, but the combination was more like trout alfredo.  I know, whatever, who cares, just shove it down your gullet and get the hell out.  There are more people waiting to be rush through dinner and hack through the soupy food.Overall, I'm gonna go with abysmal.  Thanks Home Bistro... sorry this rant probably took too long.  But I'll say now what I wanted to last night: screw you. :)"
"For over 20 years my oldest friend , Julie G, and I have been meeting for our birthdays to celebrate together. We met at Bible camp the summer of 1982, and became fast friends and pen pals. She lived in Gurnee and I lived in Racine, WI and our friendship grew from our letters and our annual birthday sleepovers. After college, living across the country from each other, career changes, a marriage and a divorce, we have remained close and finally, after all of these years, live in the same city. Since moving to Chicago in 2006, Julie and I have continued our annual celebrations by treating each other to dinner and this year decided to try a place that neither of us have tried before. HB was our choice and what a fantastic choice it was to celebrate my 36th birthday. We arrived at HB around 5:30 Saturday night thinking that it wouldn't be busy during grandpa hours and upon entering the restaurant we only saw one couple sitting at one of window tables. Score! Or, so we thought. The host, who resembled the host from the French restaurant in Ferris Bueller...minus the pompadour and suit...told us that there were no openings. There was a reservation for 30 and another reservation for 10. Damn. Surprisingly, the gracious host and another HB staff talked a bit and seated us right away near the kitchen. At this point we were just happy to have a seat! About 10 minutes later the host came back to offer us the window table that had a cancelled reservation, but by this time we were already cozy at our little table. Plus we could smell all of the delicious food coming from the kitchen! Nevertheless, the staff was accommodating in every way and was just one of the reasons why this experience was so wonderful. Now onto the food. We started with the artichoke and edam fritters with garlic aioli. in. cred. ible. seriously. I am not a big fan of artichokes and was sort of wanting to try the almond filled bacon wrapped dates that everyone raves about, but Julie is not a date fan so we opted for the fritters and I'm glad we did. Creamy, crunchy, cheesy fried goodness. Everything that a Wisconsin girl loves! Now for the main entree. I ordered the beef brisket with mashed parsnips, slaw, and jalapeno drizzle. Again...wow. The parsnip mash was creamy, the brisket tender, and the slaw added a bit of tang to make this one of the best things I have eaten so far this year. And if anything couldn't make our experience at HB any better we just had to each get our own dessert. Julie ordered the sea salt brownie and the decadent bread pudding with dates and caramel topped with 2 candles for my birthday was just for me. All of that soft gooey deliciousness all for me. YUM! HB was everything you could ever want in a restaurant. Attentive and friendly service, amazing and creative food, and an ambiance great for special occasions or just a nice evening out with your friends. Thanks HB for making my birthday dinner special and for creating yet another memory for Julie and I to share. God, I love my friends."
"Great food, horrible service. Had a reservation for 4 at 7:30 on a saturday and weren't seated until about 8:15. Nowhere to wait except in the tiny doorway next to people enjoying the meals, which was awkward. Got a table in the back with no apology for the wait. Waitress didn't tell us that they were out of several things on the menu until after we had ordered them. Everything was SLOW. Everybody really enjoyed all of the food, but the slow and poor service just kinda ruined the whole experience."
"Quaint byo joint with a super friendly and attentive staff, and delicious food... does it get any better than that? After also sampling my boyfriend's entrée (the wild boar bolognese),  and several appetizers, I'd have to say that the almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon & the ricotta gnocchi were my favorites. I'd recommend making a reservation though, since the place is quite small and apparently very popular."
"We were in search of a BYOB restaurant for a night of great food, great drinks and great conversation. However, finding a BYOB restaurant that is not Thai or asian-inspired in the Lakeview area is difficult. HB could fit us in at 9pm. I did not make the reservation but my friend, Julia, said the man was very helpful and charismatic on the phone. We arrived right on time. The space is rather small and does not lend an area for you to wait for your table -- especially in the midst of Chicago winter! The room the restaurant is in (it is very small) is decorated very nicely. I can't put my finger on one word to describe it but I liked it. We were seated near the back to the restaurant. It was very, very dark but the staff realized this and provided us with two pretty large candles to help with reading our menus. They also offered to keep our wine off the tables and chilled (if it needed chilling).Now to the menu. I am a simple girl and I like simple things -- especially when it comes to my food. The food here is a bit fussy. I did not see any dish that I wanted as it came off the menu. However, the waiter had no problem with my special request for mashed potatoes with my flank steak. The flank steak was great. I do wish they would have served it with a larger steak knife. The one they provided was rather wimpy. My fellow diners all were really excited for the lamb burger but they came back to let us know that they had ran out for the evening. They also had run out of another one of their appetizers. I know we were there late but it was a Friday night -- they need to be prepared!The other thing -- there is truffle oil on A LOT of the options. I have a strict no truffle oil rule but could SMELL it in the air. It did make me slightly queasy but the staff kept my water glass filled which helped to subside the side effects. To the defense of truffle oil -- I heard the truffle fries were quite tasty but were just like the skinny fries you got in the high school cafeteria. Overall, I like this place. It felt cozy and I enjoyed my time here. However, it was not the meal of my life."
"One of my absolute favorites - perfect for a date night. Very intimate, candle-lit, BYO, delicious, and affordable. The artichoke and edam fritters appetizer is to die for... a ""must"", if you ask me. We went most recently for Valentine's Day, and they were serving a prix fixe menu. Let me tell you: I had THE BEST MEAL OF MY LIFE that night. I only hope that they serve this meal as a special again, and I hear about it. I chose the entree of braised pork belly with cherries gastrique, served with cheesy grits and collard greens. I am not kidding when I say it was beyond incredible. The braised pork belly just melted in my mouth - amazing with a bite of cherry and a swipe of grits. I didn't even know I liked collard greens until this meal... Once again, LOVE this place. Service is good, but the food speaks for itself."
One of the best bacon wrapped date in town...don't know how they make such a simple dish so good! Hard to get reservation since the place is small. So call and plan ahead!
"I swear to God, every time I come to this restaurant, I think to myself, ""Wow, this would be an amazing place to take a significant other.""  Let's just say that if Phantom of the Opera ever melded with the kitchen from Beauty & the Beast, the result would be HB.  The food is really good, especially for the prix fixe.  The BYOB aspect is certainly a plus as well.  The only thing I was disappointed with was the pate, which was the appetizer I got the last time around."
"Since joining Yelp, I've been to HB twice now.  I have a hard time putting into words how I feel about this place, so I resisted writing a review the first time.  I can't help but write one now.This place just feels like home to me.  Maybe it is because we've gotten to know some of the wait staff on a closer level.  Maybe it is because we've lived in the neighborhood for a few years and have been coming here multiple times per year ever since.  And maybe it is just because of the coziness of the restaurant itself.  Whatever it is, this place has it.  For instance, last night when we were finished with our dessert, I was prepared to get up and say goodbye to a couple of the servers and go ... and then I remembered I had to pay.  That's the type of place this is ... you forget you are in a restaurant and believe you are visiting friends. The food here is also usually very good and pretty inventive -- though sometimes the chef stretches a little bit (I had a pork cutlet dish last night with risotto and the risotto was flavored with fennel frond, which gave it a licorice flavor ... not what I want from my risotto, personally).  Overall, the menu is fairly inventive, has awesome appetizer and main course options.  And the dessert, oh god the dessert.  If Brent would agree to come make his baklava or bread pudding for me on a daily basis, I would seriously reconsider my sexual preferences ...Overall, this place is just phenomenal.  They treat you like you belong there and they treat you like family.  And in a day and age where service seems to lack so much, when one of HB's servers is also their pastry chef, their front of the house guy is also an accomplished photographer, and the owner was the former executive chef and loved the place so much he bought it, it is easy to understand why the service is so good.You couple good service, with good prices ($28 prix fixe menu on Wednesdays, $37 all you can eat Maryland crab on Thursdays during the summer), a BYOB set-up, and some cozy surroundings, and you get this gem of a restaurant in the heart of Lakeview.  Come for the food.  Come back again and again for the people who work there."
"Probably one of the best BYOB's we have ever experienced in the city, and definitely good value for the quality of food. My wife and I rated restaurants for a well-known group and consider ourselves foodies and winos. Needless to say, we cannot stress enough how pleased we have walked out every time we've been there. The almond-stuffed dates wrapped in bacon are a vice. The catfish fritters (if available) are also addictive. I have tried the pork and the whole fish specials (also when available) and they are always perfect.Music is great, atmosphere is warm and comfortable; you never feel rushed. Call ahead however, since everything is FRESH, I'd recommend making reservations. Finally, the flan is a 10.If you run out of wine, Kafka is a block away and they're open pretty late.Parking sucks on weekends but there's a lot 1/2 block away. It's $10."
Just ate there again last night for my birthday. The staff was awesome and the $30 prix fixe menu was a steal! Food was stellar.
"In a world where customer service doesn't seem to matter anymore, I was pleasantly surprised to get a lovely note from the owner a few days after our visit. 1 star back for caring enough to reach out. We're in Chicago 2+ times each year, so this gesture means a lot. We'll try it again next time we're in town."
Best restaurant I've tried in Chicago.  Period.
"From the moment I called to make a reservation I knew the service was going to be phenemonal!  When we got here everyone was incredibly nice and I love restaurants that give suggestions right away.  We started with the fritters and ordered the trout and the crabcakes (all per recommendations). I also had to have a side of their infamous frites (so good and a huge bowl for only $5!).  Food was great and portions LARGE!  Entrees seemed to run around $18-$20, and you definitely get your money's worth.  Each dish came out perfectly timed - we never felt rushed.  Overall, this is a great BYOB spot where you can leisurely catch up with a group of friends or have a date.  They didn't even mind us running to Kafka to pick up another bottle of wine after the app.  I recommend resos as we were seated very promptly with them."
"After spending the last three years running a resort destination, I feel like I know all the more about how much work goes into creating a consistent and fulfilling experience.  From the generous directions and wine tips given even as I called to make a reservation to the unbelievable chocolate/butterscotch/chocolate dessert which finished our meal here.  I was thoroughly impressed.It's a small place with creative but simple decor to set a bright ambiance that perfectly fits the palette pleasing combinations you'll find.  The specials tonight included a fresh spinach/bacon/watermelon/parmesan app which was delicious and fresh as well as tiger prawns in a curried couscous broth.  Even the mashed pea concoction that comes with the fish (beer battered so lightly it ate like tempura, delicious) was delightful.  I'm new to the Lincoln Park neighborhood but an old school foodie and this jumped to the top of my local list.It even managed to combine BYOB with full service, as the wait staff was always attentive to bring another beer (which they deposit in their cooler upon entry) or top off your wine."
"Hoping that YELP steers you in the right direction?  Searched for a top rated BYOB restaurant for our late Friday dinner.  HB Home Bistro was the choice.  Bob (part owner) took our phone reservation. Even offered up tips on finding parking as Halsted can be a challenge.  We arrived 1/2 hr. early for our 9:45 reservation.  Seated by 9:35.  Place was crowded, lots of energy, noisy, and every table had at least one bottle of wine on it.We were waited on by John-Carl (co-owner and chef) who likes to do this from time to time to mingle with the people eating his creations.  Nice touch to hear in detail how he travels the world in search of great food, spices and preparation ideas.  Most of the food we had was really, really good.Bread is very good, fresh, and served with a garlic butter.  We decided on three apps and split one entree (the whole fish that we saw being delivered to another table.... food envy).  The Uitsmijter (truffled fried egg on top of maple fried bacon and a bread that tasted like challah).  Oh lord!  The artichoke and Edam fritters... sinfully good, if you like the deep fried taste.  Mussels were just average, small in size and the broth was watery.John-Carl filleted the whole fish (Whitefish) at the table, making it very easy to split and enjoy.  Chunks of calamari and tomato on the top.  He offered Kosher salt and lemon, which the dish needed.Only two desserts available; delivery problems due to subzero weather.  The pineapple upside down cake with  whipped cream and caramel drizzle was a perfect ending to this evening.  Can't wait to return to try other creations here.Prices very affordable.  NO corkage fee.  Delicious food.  Friendly staff.  What else is there?"
"Wow...just realized that I have not reviewd this FABULOUS locale.  Yes, HB was great when it was the Hearty Boys but as Home Bistro it is just as magnificent.  The chef remained the same and that is where the talent lies. The food is AMAZING...dinner or brunch.  It is BYOB so stop by Kafka and pick your poisin.  Their menu is uber-delicious!!  There is something for everyone and it is fresh, fresh, fresh.The photography on the walls is constantly changing and the inspiration of one of the owners.If you have not been then GO!  What are you waiting for??!"
"Oh. My. Lord.So last Friday we were looking for a nice BYOB place, with good food, nothing too fancy, somewhere we could sit and stay a while. I had wanted to try HB for quite some time, and called for reservations. There's a voicemail that tells you to leave a message with your name, phone number, and the time/day you'd like to come in. I figured, I'm calling at 6 on a Friday, we'd better come up with a back up plan. Well 15 minutes later, the FOH manager gave me a call, and got us set up. He said if we wanted to come a little early, they'd open wine for us at the host stand while we waited. (P.S. Stop off at Kafka across the street before to pick up your wine. It's cheap, and the boy working was cute and we danced to Thriller for a while.)I'd probably give it 4 1/2 stars, just because our reservations were at 9:15, and we didn't get seated until after 10, but I'll round up, because of the number of orgasms I began to have once I started eating. Start with the dates. You won't regret it. Dates and almonds wrapped in proscuitto.... oh god. You know when you have to close your eyes because you want to lose yourself in the moment? Then have the tilapia. My best friend said not to ever order tilapia, because it's a cheap ingredient, so always gets marked up 1000%. Screw that. If I could have babies and settle down in the suburbs with that tilapia, we'd be on our way to Naperville right now. (My friends had the pork and the swordfish, both of which they swore were better. I admit, they were heavenly--but you know you're the only one for me, tilapia.)We were jazzed about the cupcake flight for dessert, but our server (who had the most beautiful biceps, if that's any incentive) said that day's batch came out flat, so we had some sort of cake-y-moussey thing that was a good way to wrap up a perfect meal.Go there. Go now. And have the tilapia."
"I'm not going to go into a meal by meal breakdown or a 17 point presentation for why this place is one of my new favorites in Chicago, so I'll keep it simple: 5 star restaurant. Everything I've eaten has been -AMAZING-. As another reviewer put it, the food is the star of the show and why it's worth five stars. You'll love whatever entree you order, you won't pay ridiculous prices and it's BYOB.I've visited HB three times and had three excellent dishes. The last meal I had was the Duck Breast with BBQ lentils and golden beats. I wasn't sure what to expect with that combination, but I was not let down. Another great one. If you're getting desert I'd recommend the bread pudding."
"If it weren't too loud, it would've been a perfect place to bring a date. Still it is quite an intimate venue with some unique menu items. Love the almond stuffed dates. Will definitely try again if they offer the Shanghai hair crabs when it is the season. Oh. That makes me home sick."
"I am a die hard fan of the home bistro. My love affair with this place started when we first moved to Chicago about 2 years ago. My partner and I went every Sunday for brunch and we were hooked. The specials are amazing. Blood orange pancakes, banana Fosters French toast, lemon and date pancakes-they turned me into a carb queen! In addition, to the delicious food we found the staff all exceptionally friendly and attentive. They learned our names, give us hugs when we get there, and let us ""sample"" the specials to see what we think. And it is not just us; they treat everyone like they are incredibly special and important. Dinner is also rave worthy. The fish specials are delicious. I love the unique tastes and fusion. The Wednesday pre-fix is great. It's a steal for $25 for three courses. This is our standard double date restaurant because it's cozy, personal, delicious and not too loud. Some nights they are pretty busy, so I do suggest reservations. Celebrations at our house are rewarded with a dessert trip to HBs for the bread pudding. Try it and you will never think of bread pudding the same away again!"
"Wow!  Seriously, wow!  This place is incredible.  Went here last night with the parents AND father-in-law, and everyone loved it.  Maybe you don't understand how impressive that is, but let's just say that a typical meal with either family ends with at least one complaint.  Onto the food...the truffle fries with tandoori ketchup are absolutely addicting.  They could very well be my new favorite food.  The bacon wrapped dates and artichoke fritters were also great.  I had the lamb burger, which was delicious (once again, comes with truffle fries).  The blood orange creamsicle mousse is incredible, tastes like a gourmet version of the old school creamsicle.Our service was wonderful.  Our server was great and the chef, Joncarl, is quite possibly one of the nicest guys.  We chatted with him for awhile and we even ended up buying one of the photos displayed in the bathroom (the artwork throughout is by Bob, the front-of-house guy and is for sale).  This place seriously hits the mark in every aspect!"
"Walked in after a Cub game with no reservation & booze in hand. HB is a small & charming place with very good service. The menu not overwhelming but loaded with above average choices. I read so much on Yelp about the delicious appetizers but passed to get a salad. This just means I will have to come back & I will. Our entrees' lived up to our expectations with the exception of one. It was a chicken, pasta dish that was all dark meat. My friend was a little disappointed in that. Otherwise wonderful!"
"Super yum!!!  I don't want to bore you by detailing the splendors that so many before me have enumerated, so I won't.  Just go to HB.All the delicious rumors are true!"
"This place was great...and popular so be sure you can get a table.  Had the lamb shoulder stew, mussels, salmon salad and homemade ho-ho for dessert.  Everything was exceptional in my book."
"I love this place for brunch.  They have always had some good staples with great special dishes that I have found to be good every time.  The service is excellent!  I have always been greated with enthusiasm and the coffee flowed.  The atmoshpere is adorable although if its busy be prepared to be a bit cramped.  In the summer its great because they open the windows and you feel as if you are sitting outside.On a side note, I have brought my baby here and they were super accomodating.  I can see why most people say not kid friendly because it is smaller and I don't think they have height chairs.  But at least with a baby bjorn, the staff was not horrified and did not avoid me.My four star only comes from the fact that the dinners have been hit or miss.  Most have been pretty good but a few have been bland, especially the desserts."
"This is one of the best dining experiences that I've had in a while. It was A plus from start to finish. Went here with Arlene M. last Wednesday for the prix fixe. She had been here before and highly recommended it, and since I missed it during Yelp Eats I was pretty excited. Normally when I get super excited about something, I build it up in my head to a height that said 'something' could never reach. Knowing my tendency to over hype things, I figured that even if it wasn't all it was cracked up to be - I'd drink too much wine and do some good girl chatting. Luckily, the evening didn't depend on gossip alone. We started with the almond stuffed, bacon wrapped dates. Mouthwatering. I will be giving these a shot at home some time because I'm now addicted. I got the baked haloumi. Very tasty and served with rye crisps with some type of jam. As you can tell, I'm a big fan of the savory / sweet combos. Arlene got the steak and pomme frites with garlic aoli. The steak was cooked perfectly. Nice salty crust on the outside and juicy on the inside. And okay - I know that pomme frites are just french fries - but these ain't coming out of a fry-o-later 3000. This is french fry perfection. And who doesn't love garlic mayo? I went with the quail (which was actually 2) served over chorizo and potatoes with purple basil. Just wonderful. For dessert I had the bread pudding with caramel and chocolate drizzle, while Arlene got the fresh berries with vanilla whipped cream. It's a good thing that Arlene doesn't mind sharing, because I definitely suffered from 'wandering fork syndrome' that evening. All of that makes for a great experience but what puts this place over the top for me is the service. Everyone here makes you feel so at home. Like you've been going there for years. The chef stopped by our table a few times to relight our candle (which was being stubborn) and to chat. We talked about food, drinks (as he giggled at our two bottles of wine), to his cats. He was very welcoming and his food is amazing. I am in restaurant love. Can't wait to go back!"
"I LOVE HB! Everything that I've had here has been awesome. The risotto had been my favorite but I think HB may have outdone itself with the dates I tried last time. Plus, the service is great. There's just something refreshing about calling on a Thursday for a Friday night reservation and having the person work with you rather than laugh. This is one of my favorites in Chicago!Update: Also try the peaches and cream bread pudding! It's to die for!"
"I was taken here by surprise, and boy was I in for a treat!.The wait staff was friendly and knowledgeable.We started with the fritters and ordered the trout and the crabcakes (all per recommendations). I also had to have a side of their infamous frites (so good and a huge bowl for only $5!).  Food was great and portions LARGE!  Overall, this is a great BYOB spot where you can leisurely catch up with a group of friends or have a date.  They didn't even mind us running to Kafka to pick up another bottle of wine after the app. We were thirsty...S&JMay08"
"Prix Fixe Wednesday is not to be missed.  The place is cozy, charming and the best place in the neighborhood to wow a date or partner.    Blissfully terrific."
"I knew HB was just the perfect place to go when my friend left me in charge to find a good BYOB where we could savor the nice bottles of the French wine producers they had been working for/with over the weekend.......We arrived with 6 bottles.Left empty-handed.I could rant for pages about the great evening we had there, the sparkly conversation, the escalating sampling of red ambrosia, the extreme friendliness of the staff and the generosity of the chef Joncarl. But lucky for you and me, my hubby (the moustached Reuben H) has already done it.Since I started a mussel list - I want to talk a little bit about them.These little babies need some love. I am more than willing to give it to them.They are presented on the menu as ""Amsterdam Style"" and it is quite different from what you can find elsewhere in the city. Here no tomato, white wine or onion but pungent anise, beer and dried basil. That makes for a total different experience but it is still succulent and brings back memories of North Sea Belgian ports.Not 'exotic' maybe but still worth it in my book.Another piece of information: there is much less sauce to soak up with bread than in places visited before.....hence less messy to eat. You have aioli on the side to compensate.A more straight-forward approach to my friends ""les moules"". Sometimes it is nice to go back to basics."
"HB apparently stands for Home Bistro.  I can't say I agree - I think it stands for Holy Bacon-wrapped-dates!It was my first bacon wrapped date experience ever.  EVER.  Where have I been??  Seriously, the bacon wrapped dates were delish.I'm going to start with the ""points that lost this place a star"" to get them out of the way, then move on to the good stuff. - the entrance is one giant clusterfuck, or at least it was when I arrived on Friday.  When I checked in (15 minutes early) the guy up front mumbled something about my table not being ready, gave me no indication of when it would be, then didn't really acknowledge my presence again until it WAS ready - almost half an hour later.  There is no room to stand around and wait, so I'd shuffle to the right when another party came in the door, shuffle to the left when the server needed to get to tables in the window, and no matter where I went I felt like I was in the way.  When my dinner date, Rob L, arrived, he couldn't even get to me because there was a group of girls standing in the doorway because again...  nowhere else to go.  They also seemed short staffed, with two servers and another guy (maybe the owner?) handling all the tables, the host stand, the phone, and anything else.  I think one more person would have made it seem less chaotic. - one bathroom - unisex - for the whole place.  At least the man before me was nice and put the toilet seat down.  But yikes.*ahem*Now on to the good stuff that made up for the lousy first impression I was getting.Cute decor, and I love that they used old wine bottles as candle holders. We had a table in the very back corner, and it was cozy but loud.  I sort of couldn't hear Rob L or our server at times.  Our server was fantastic, so no complaints there.  She promptly filled our glasses with the champagne we brought, then chilled it for us.We started things off with bacon wrapped dates and the artichoke and edam fritters.  I've already professed my love of the dates, but the artichoke fritters were damn good too.  I didn't realize until later that I didn't try the sauce it came with, but on their own they're pretty good so I don't feel like I missed out on anything.Entrees - Rob went with the pork (apparently the swine flu paranoia only made him crave pork, pork, and more pork), I went with the steak and famous truffle fries.  The steak was good - not the best I've had, but still delicious, and the truffle fries...  well, those things are like crack.  Rob and I kept munching on them long after we were ""done"" eating.  And I was sort of craving them the next day.  So yeah, good stuff.Oh, dessert...  I went with the apple and butterscotch bread pudding, and Rob had the chocolate chip chocolate bundt cake.  They brought his out with a candle (we were celebrating his birthday a little late), and they didn't sing - thank god.  My bread pudding was freaking good, but I have to say I should have ordered what Rob had because all that chocolate was just delicious in a way that should be illegal.Overall, a very solid meal.  I'd come back and try some of the other things on the menu, but trust me when I say those bacon wrapped dates will be a repeat....  mmm...."
"I went with my girlfriend to HB to celebrate her recent birthday.  I had heard about the wednesday $29 3-course prixfixe before from chicagoprixfixe.com, but I have yet to check this place out.Overall I had a fantastic experience.  I really enjoy these types of small cozy restaurants.  I'm not that awed by fancy glitzy and glamorous places.  The ambiance here is great for an intimate evening with a date, or friends, for which BYOB is a must.I have to say that the bacon-wrapped almond stuffed dates were just okay, the bacon did bring a unique and pleasant smokey flavor if you stopped to enjoy it.  But I am still an avid fan of Avec's bacon-wrapped chorizo stuffed dates, which I think are the tastiest thing I have ever eaten.Beyond that, both the coriander salmon, and the 12-hour beef brisket were excellent.  It's comfort food in my eyes.  And while I didn't have any expectations for the bread pudding, it also was excellent, with a hint of caramel to really bring it home for me.I had a great night with my girlfriend, at this great restaurant, AND a great price.  I would recommend it to others."
"I give HB a 4.5.  I totally understand why so many people give the restaurant 5 stars and recommend that everyone go on a date there.  However, for a restaurant to be 5 stars in my book, the food must be perfect.  I think that the almond-stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates killed the fifth star for me.  My favorite dish at Avec, I was expecting to be in heaven with this dish.  Maybe my problem was having a flavor expectation but I thought the bacon had far too much fat which killed the potentially great flavors.  The edamame fritters were interesting and very good.Our entree, roasted chicken was spectacular.  My boyfriend brings it up every time I try to keep him from ordering chicken (you know, it's usually not the most inventive dish on the menu) at a nice restaurant.  The flavors were excellent and I found myself fighting him for the skin.While I wasn't completely blown away by the food and over-all interior of the restaurant, the shining star of this restaurant is the host who could not be more charming.  He makes customers instantly feel like friends and makes sure they are all well taken care of."
"A well thought out and executed menu, but I felt that nothing I tried was exceptional.   The service was good but the atmosphere was a little too loud for a party of 6 to enjoy a conversation.  I'd recommend that you stick to parties of 4 or less when making a reservation.  I would be willing to go back, but I'm not in a hurry to do so."
"I was taken here by the lovely Jo W for a belated birthday dinner. See, I like to celebrate my birthday for at least a month. Its the only way kids, the only way. Spread out the love. I came here and met my friend Jo for our 7:30pm reservation. The place is cute, romantic and small. Small candles dot each table, as the night wore on, you can tell this isn't a bad place for a group of girls, group of friends or that someone special. But sadly there is one thing that was a killer for this place and that was the noise level. It was loud, not as bad as I have been to in other places, but kinda annoying, I won't lie. However there are quite a few things that make up for all of this hub bub .. bub. The service was really quite good. Even though our server was stretched a little bit, (plus she looked like a friend of mine who is out of town, kinda freaked me out a little), she was spot on when she was with us. Made me feel like we were the only ones there. Wish I remembered her name so I could recommend her. Its BYOB. Gotta love that. I was lucky to be treated by Jo to a bottle of Vueve Rose, her first rose champagne, I'm such the lucky guy. The food was any where from good to really great. Let's break our meal down. We started off with the artichoke fritters and the dates. Dates were good, I mean they are wrapped in bacon, how could they not be good? Stuffed with almonds and topped with brown sugar. Now since they are already a little sweet, I thought the brown sugar was a little overkill. Or perhaps I just like mine a little savory. The fritters were great, a little soft and chewy on the inside, a crispy on the outside and not at all greasy or oily. Also, it came with a garlic aioli which certainly had a bite of garlic to it, though I had no problem with that. Then for the main, Jo went with the steak with truffle fries, whilest I went with the pork loin. With all this talk of swine flu this and that, I've been on quite a porky craving. This stuff fit the bill, however I do have some minor qualms. First off the pork is good, although a little over cooked. The potatoes were good, however I felt like the pork was swimming in the left over juices of the apple and cabbage that accompanied the rest of the dish. It was flavorful pool, but I tend to like to see what I am eating, although search for what ever at the bottom was a little bit of fun and at the same time, no diving equipment needed. I really don't eat beef, but her fries were open for the taking and take I did, delicious. Not too heavy of truffle flavor, but just enough to enjoy. Then came dessert. I will say this, thank the freakin' universe no song was sung. Just not a fan of being sung Happy Birthday too. However I will take a candle in the chocolate chip bundt cake, actually screw the candle, I will just take this chocolaty, moist and slightly ooey gooey tasty treat to finish off my slightly bursting stomach. Jo had the bread pudding, which I think she liked, although I think I did spy a look of wanting my cake.... oh whoops... sorry I just polished it off.  All in all it was a really good night to once again celebrate me. I wonder if I could parlay this for the next six months or so..."
"Good food, great comfortable space. The service was a little scattered while we were there but when I made the reservation earlier that evening the host was very pleasant and super nice. There were four of us for dinner and we had mussels and pork belly and brisket. The pork belly and brisket were very tender, cooked and seasoned to perfection, my mussels were a generous portion but when I reached towards the bottom of the bowl I found more and more unopened ones, I was pretty stuffed so it did not matter as much but those should have been pulled out. Our desserts made up for it, we had one of everything. Delicious bread pudding! Thanks for a great time HB, I will return very soon!"
"So this is my first review to write on Yelp so not only am I a little unsure about my writing skills, I'm a little hesitant to overrate on my first review.  But here goes...I went to Home Bistro with my boyfriend and another couple during Yelp's restaurant week.  I really wasn't expecting too much from the food, mainly due to lack of knowledge about the place, but was super excited about the BYOB.  So I went with little appetite but definitely ready to booze.  Quickly after the waiter brought yhe bread served with truffle butter, I forgot all about my wine.  The bread wasn't amazing or anything, but I'm a sucker for truffle oil.  Because it was restaurant week, there was a prix fixe menu, which I was happy to see had great options!  Despite my lack of appetite, I was still down for three courses.  The waiter did a great job of providing his favorites both on the special menu and off and was very attentive, but not overly attentive, throughout the whole meal.  The restaurant was packed so it was nice to see that the service didn't suffer.  I started off with the Caesar salad - nothing special, but a good way to start off a three course meal.  My boyfriend and the other dude each got the artichoke edam fritter, which was very good but definitely should have been a splitter as it was just big fried balls.  The other girl got the bacon-wrapped dates.  She was literally swatting her boyfriend's fork away with hers to keep him from snagging bites so it must have been good.  Although I was not lucky enough to get a bite of an actual date, I did get to try to the brown sugar balls that came with the dish.  I'm pretty sure it was cooked in bacon fat because it was the best brown sugar I've ever had!  Moving on to the second course, I debated between the mussels and the mixed seafood special.  Because the mussels came with fries and I knew I was going to house a dessert, I went with the lighter option and chose the mixed seafood.  I was not disappointed.  The broth had a ton of flavor and the mix of clams, mussels, shrimp, garlic, and onion, made the dish hearty enough for a full meal.  My boyfriend and the other dude went with the pork dish.  Now don't get me wrong, this dish was awesome, but it was not in any way, shape, or form good for you.  My boyfriend looked over at his buddy's dish and noticed that he had twice as many scalloped potatoes as his dish, but he quickly realized that it was a good thing based of how rich the dish was.  For me, only a few bites of dishes like that are any good.  Both boys were very happy with their meals.  Our other friend got the salmon with lentils.  I'm a big fan of salmon, but this dish was pretty ehh for me.  Although she didn't say it, I think she was disappointed in her order when compared to the others.  She ate most of it though and didn't complain.  Lastly, we each got a dessert with the prix fixe meal.  To get something a little lighter to balance the hefty pork dish, my boyfriend ordered the special lemon custard.  It was really good!  The girlfriend and I ordered the bread pudding at the suggestion of the waiter and we were both very pleased.  Despite our full stomachs, we were both able to finish them off with some unwanted help from the boys.  The other dude got the chocolate bundt cake, which was nothing special and, being that I'm not a huge chocolate fan, too rich/dry for me.  When I finally looked up from my feeding frenzy, I was pleased to find that I still had a whole glass of wine left and I sat back to enjoy while the boys paid.  Overall, Home Bistro was very good and I would recommend it to others (and actually already have) - the food was very good, service great, and you can't beat BYOB!  The bathroom was really cool too.  The only negative to the night were the people lingering in the very tight doorway waiting to be seated.  As is a typical problem for most smaller restaurants, sometimes small and quaint is closely related to tight and cramped.  I don't hold it against them though."
We had a fantastic meal here on Saturday night. The Parmesan truffle fries are beyond good. The service was great and the cupcake dessert flight is sooo delicious. Save room for the cupcakes!!This place is a complete hit and I will definitely go back.
"Went last night and it was GREAT! They have a $29 three course option where you get an app/desert, a salad and an entree. Great deal! We did the arctichoke fritters which were really yummy. Crispy with a lemon taste. Next we each had the mixed greens salad. Dressing is really good and they have figs and nuts in the salad. I had the Chicken Confit with Snert. I did not know what snert was and it is a way of cooking peas. The chicken was so tender and it fell off the bone. My friend had the trout and enjoyed hers as well. This is a brand new menu for them and we ended with a pastry with berries. Our server was awesome and everything was delicious! I will definitely be back!"
I love the $30 pre fixe special on Wednesday. It's so much good food for a good price. I liked the bacon wrapped dates and the artichoke cheese fritters. The truffle fries were excellent as well. I couldn't make it through even a third of my main entree (which was the pork belly special with mushrooms and green beans). I took one star off because I thought the blueberry bread pudding was not up to par like the rest of the dishes. The atmosphere is nice and quaint. I would definitely go back to try other items on the menu.
"I'd give it a 4.5.  Food was pretty great - but this is the highest rated restaurant in Lakeview.  I didn't think it was the best.  It is BYOB, which is awesome (probably everyone's wasted, hence the high reviews), and it is reasonably priced.  I would definitely return."
"Home Bistro if absolutely outstanding. The appetizers, main course and desserts are incredible. This place is a byob, the wait staff is great and the prices are very fair. Reservations are not required but definitely help."
"Great date restaurant. Cozy size, great food, and BYOB.  The owner even came to talk to me about the art on the walls!"
"I kind of can't say enough good things about sweet little HB. My friends and I usually come here en masse to celebrate birthdays, holidays or just to get together and eat some fantastic food and drink what we like. Every time I have been here, in the aforementioned boozy herd of 10 or in a quiet breakfast twosome, I have always been welcomed and treated with the same genuine warmth. Aside from the food, which is seriously so consistently good (specials always shine and I can't go without an order of the artichoke fritters or my new fave app, the haloumi), I love how enthusiastically the servers describe the food-- I always ask for reco's because they know their stuff and they never disappoint. Dessert kicks it too-- love love love the cupcake trio, the chocolate bundt and the seasonal bread puddings!  Man-o-man do I heart HB!"
"This place was incredible!  Every dish we tried was unique and well thought out.  The environment is really intimate and warm and the staff could not be more friendly. We had the almond-stuffed dates (wrapped in bacon) as a yummy appetizer, our entrees were also great, but the outright winner was the brioche bread pudding for dessert-- amazing.  We will definitely be going back and often.  Plan to bring a bottle of wine or two.  There's a great wine shop just down the street."
"If you're looking for a place to take a group of 4-6 where you can make reservations and it's byob, HB is a great choice.  The restaurant is well decorated, with candles for mood lighting and big windows.  They cater to byob-- champagne flutes are available if needed and they'll refridgerate your beer or wine-- I love that.  They serve up big portions of american food with a twist, have a good mix of well done seafood and meats, but not a ton of vegetarian entree options.  Very friendly service, and even though the restaurant is pretty classy, they didn't snub us for bringing a kooler (although it turns out we didn't need it).  Bonus points.Quality for the Cost: 6Service: 8"
"The food was good. . artichoke and edam fritters were great! The main thing about this place was the service. My date and I felt loved when we left. We actually had to stop outside and discuss how surreal it was to have that much genuine care and love come from a business. as native chicagoans, we were taken off guard by this experience, but thoroughly enjoyed it. no drinks, 2 entrees, 1 app, tax, & tip =$65. WORTH IT."
"What makes a 5 star restaurant?  For me it's a break down of 40% food, 40% service and 20% atmosphere.  Home Bistro hit all the right notes.  Oh, and did I mention they are BYOB?  You can't feel guilty ordering appetizers and desserts when you're not paying for booze.Without a reservation, I was seated with 3 of my friends at 8 p.m. on a Thursday night.  Actually, I was only with 2 of them, waiting for the other 2 to show up and they graciously set up a table for us without the ""your whole party needs to be here"" spiel.Our ""waiter"", who we later found out was the chef (!) was so friendly.We split the artichoke and edam fritters for an appetizer.  They were so deliclious...not greasy and packed full of flavor.  Plus, I'm a sucker for garlic aioli.Two of us enjoyed the Morracan lentils, and the others had the catfish and salmon.  Absolutely no complaints.  Presentation, aromas and flavors were all spot on.But I must say the dessert was the real treat.  We split the chocolate chocolate chip bundt cake and the cupcake flight.  I can't even remember the variety of cupcakes but I do remember how each of them were so unique and delectable.It's really hard to say if it's the service or the food that will bring me back to HB.  Or maybe it'll be the bread pudding the chef described for us before we left.  Either way, I highly recommend this quaint neighborhood nook."
"This place lives up to the big expectations that might arise from so many good reviews!! and that's not always the case, so good job. The place is intimate and romantic but with no ostentation, it has a familiar and friendly atmososphere, and the music is not cheesy. I went there tonight with my boyfriend to celebrate our new car, and all the food ranged from good to delicious. As a start, they brought us a few pieces of bread (actually focaccia) with some balsamic vinegar and seasoning, which I appreciated. We shared artichoke&edam fritters as a starter, and their soft and creamy heart had already won us over. Then I had the mussels and he had the salmon, and both were really tasty and fresh (special mention goes to the broth that came with my mussels!!). Portions were not huge so we went for desserts, and that was a glorious ending!! We had the ""ho-ho"" (very refreshing, chocolaty roll) and the most wonderful dessert ever, the bread pudding with strawberry conserve. I'm usually not a big fan of dessert, but I totally LOVED it!! Warm and soft, sweet but not too much, it really blew me off!! The service was also excellent, fast and nice. Price is mid-range, but it is good for what you get. The only downside is the view of the SevenEleven on the other side of the street.. some curtains wouldn't hurt. Overall, it was a very pleasing experience, and HB jumps on the list of my favourite places in town!!"
"Let me start off by saying that my parents are huge BYOB fans. They come up to visit and take us all out to dinner quite often ,and always want to try out BYOB places. We have frequented tons of places in the city which are all very good, but I am not sure if I would go there again if it weren't for the BYOB aspect. This is not the case here, I LOVED this place regardless of the alcohol. We arrived to a pretty small and dimly lit restaurant. With the added touch of exposed brick, the atmosphere was wonderful. They had a large table they were setting up for the 6 of us when we walked in. The hostess immediately took one of our wine bottles and opened it, making sure we had drinks as soon as we sat down. They started us off with some bread and what tasted like a balsamic reduction sauce. The menu isn't large, but each of us had multiple dishes we were deciding from. They also had multiple specials which included appetizers and entrees. We decided to go with the crisp fried oysters and the Gouda tasting to start with. The oysters were amazing. They were accompanied by cream spinach and a lemon fennel oil. I am a huge oyster fan, both raw and cooked, and I loved them. My sister, who is not a fan, loved them as well. The Gouda tasting came out with about 5 different cheeses along with some crackers and a jelly. Of course the cheese plate was delicious!Like I said, for entrees we were all torn between a few dishes. I ended up with the Mussels and truffle fries. It was a HUGE portion, I had no chance of finishing it. The flavor of the mussels were delicious and very fresh. The truffle fries were great as well, with the truffle being just subtle enough not to overwhelm. It came with what looked and tasted like a garlic aioli, but I didn't use it as it looked like mostly mayonnaise. The only other dish I tasted was my fiance's. He got the special which was a veal osso bucco a-top creamed corn and topped with bacon and a sauce. AMAZING! I hope they make it a menu staple! Other dishes ordered were the seafood boulibase (which was another special) and the fried catfish. Everyone loved their meals. For dessert we all split 2. We had bread pudding and what they described as a home-made ""Ho Ho."" Both were delicious.All in all, it was a great experience. We brought 4 bottles of wine and each bottle was opened before or as soon as a bottle was finished. They service was great, as the waiter and hostess were both very attentive. I would say this would be a great place for family, friends, or couples to get together!"
"Honestly, BYOB has never been better. We went there for our anniversary with some friends. Opened El Nido, Graff Cab, Groom Shiraz  and Delille Cellars that evening. The food stood up wonderfully to these incredible big wines. The fried oysters were out of this word. The pork shoulder was so simple but even the bed of corn bread was perfect. Kudos to HB! The only knock on them is that they did not like our slower pace and subtly made it known. The food and friends made me not worry about the slight lack of tact. Overall, thrilled. Will be back again and again!"
"This place has it ALL for brunch. A very welcoming atmosphere, friendly and funny staff, TOP NOTCH food and best of all NO WAIT!Skip the line at Orange or Toast and check out HB this weekend. You won't be disappointed!My favorites are the truffled fries and the corned beef."
"This review is specific to brunch only.  I had high hope for this place given that other yelpers 5 stars review.  I really want to like this place, but my experience was sad to say disappointing.The menu was enticing enough, so we had omelet, fritata on their special and portobello over eggs, truffle parmesan fries and beignets (we were a hungry bunch).  Fries were ok, but not much truffle taste, beignets were disappointing, too doughy, not fluffy enough.  Maybe if they make the beignets smaller, and sprinkle more powdered suger, it'll be more like it.  My portobello over eggs had 4 thin slides of portobello, very stingy.  Overall, the food was lacking in taste.  One thing we all liked was the side biscuit that came with strawberry butter.Service was slow, we even had to wait for our silverware after the food comes.  There're way too many good brunch places for us to go back to this one.  I might go back to try their wed pre fixe dinner."
"Such a cute, quaint place... perfect for a date! AND, it is BYOB! How can you go wrong? You can also make reservations so go ahead and plan your night out! There were a handful of things I wanted to try on the menu (next time: the beef brisket) but had to opt for the mussels. I LOVE mussels and hadn't had them in awhile so was really craving them. Unfortunately, nobody wanted to split them with me so I had to order them alone as my entree. It was HUGE! They came with crispy shoestring fries (yum!) and although both the mussels and frites were delicious, it was a little bit too much for one person to have as a meal. Oh, and I forgot to mention we also had the crispy artichoke fritters... delicious but a little too fried for me. Overall, my stomach left happy. I will totally go back in a heartbeat!"
"HB quickly became one of my favorite restaurants. I have been twice so far and both with parties of 8+ for birthday dinners. The service has been oustanding both times. The staff and kitchen are so accomodating especially for a large crowd in a small space. You MUST have the fritters and the bacon wrapped dates for an appetizer. Both my favorites. The last time I went, I had the lamb burger. Everything was great except for the burger itself. Though huge, it was bland and almost like a ""lamb loaf"". We were there late and our group had the last three burgers they were offering for the night so I'll give them that. I will still go back again and again!"
"I love Home Bistro.  My SO and I consider ourselves regulars.  Brunch and dinner are equally fabulous.  I literally fantasize about the bacon-wrapped, almond-stuffed, brown sugared dates.  The baked haloumi cheese is another must-order.  On our last trip, we shared the curried lamb pot pie, which was outstanding.  And, as the uber-friendly staff always reminds us, HB is BYOB!  We always forget to bring booze, but you really don't need it - the food and atmosphere are already fantastic."
"Wow I must have missed something when I had dinner there last night. I definitely loved the $29 pick 3 deal which including a appetizer, main course, and a dessert but I didn't think that it was anything spectacular. The bacon wrapped dates were just that bacon wrapped around a date and put under a broiler. The crabcakes were good but I have definitely had better. The dessert which was a adult version of a ho-ho was the best thing I ate all night. It is byob which was nice and our waitress was great but I would definitely go elsewhere before I went back."
"OMG, this place is freaking good!  I had a crab salad (can't remember exactly) and it was delish.  The best part was the service.  The servers are so incredibly nice and make you feel like you're eating in their home.  Loved that it's BYOB!  We brought champagne and they brought out ice to chill it in.  Highly recommended!"
"I went for the $25 price fixe dinner on Wednesday and it was not only a great deal, but delicious as well! We started with the crab cakes and lamb risotto, which had a little bit of apple in it which made it slightly sweet. For our entrees we had the pork (again, had sweet apples in it) and a lamb pasta dish. Dessert was chocolate bundt cake and bananas foster bread pudding. We left very stuffed and very happy :-)It didn't get too busy until later (after 8), so reservations might be helpful depending on when you plan on eating. Overall, everyone working there was *very* helpful and friendly (from the gentleman on the phone taking our reservations to our server for the evening). Also, don't forget that it is BYOB so make sure to bring some wine!"
"OH MY GOD!!!! This restaurant is amazing. We went last night for the $30 prix fixe menu. We arrived a little late, but the owner, Johncarl, was there to great us and let us sit while we waited for another member of our party. An hour later, we were still sitting there waiting for our friend, but our waiter was gracious and continued to poor us our BYO wine.  We had the almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, edamame fritters and fried cheese to start. The dates were out of this world fantastic and far superior to the dates at Avec (which I love). The fritters were pretty amazing too. Next I had the beet salad. The flavor combinations were perfect and I could eat that beet salad everyday for the rest of my life and never be tired of it. For our main courses we had the mussels, the beef stew and the amish chicken. Everything was cooked to perfection and super fresh. The food was great, the service perfect and I have absolutely no complaints. If you cant tell, I love this place! GO!"
"Owned by this couple who recently won some contest on the food network and turned their catering business into a restaurant. The vibe is pretty laid back and it is BYOB, but it feels like they are trying too hard to make ""cool"" food, instead of just making it taste good.  I don't need truffle cheese and roasted corn cus cus in my ceaser salad, or cayan pepper in my chocolate cupcake.  These guys obviously know how to cook, they should get back to the basics and stop trying to force this new wave west coast cuisine down our throats."
"April, 2011HB continues to be one of my favorite restaurants ever.  Besides the fact that it's less than 50 ft from my house, the food has continued to improve throughout the years I've gone to HB.  (Sidenote - while Exec Chef Joncarl has opened a second restaurant, Vincent, in Andersonville, Sous Chef David executes Joncarl's vision flawlessly.  Chef Joncarl still hops back and forthe between his restaurant, but HB is my preferred, and has a special place in my heart.)Onto the food....The specials and menu evolve - the most recent bay scallop apperizer - delicious!  The pork belly sepcial with beans and pickled radishes - MMMMMMM MMMMMM GOOD!!!!  If you get anything out of my review, here are 4 points...1) get the truffle tries2) get the bread pudding. even if you THINK you're full/stuffed, you have room for bread pudding.3) come back. the specials, menu evolve, and HB knows how to make their proteins!4) get the bread pudding. rinse. repeat.   **************************************************­**************************3/21/2007This used to be HB, A Hearty Boys Spot, but has recently undergone new ownership, and has been renamed Home Bistro.Luckily, they preserved some key dishes of the original menu, with the $30 three course menu.  I went with two other gals and we had a blast.  It's BYOB, so we started with our Chianti wine from Kafka.  They immediately uncorked the wine, and brought out foccacia bread with thyme butter (YUM!).  The bread was soft and moist, and the butter rich, a little bit sweet.  Our server, Matt, was extremely patient with us, as we decided on what to order.  He gave us a heads up on what dishes would fall out of the $30 deal, as well as items that they were running low on.  We ordered 3 starters: fritters, crab cake, mussels.  Of those 3, the mussels was the best.  The fritters and crab cake were good, but were a little too fried.  We then proceeded to order our entrees: 2 of us ordered porkchops, and the other tilapia.  I must say that the porkchops do live up to its hype; I don't even love pork, and it was so well prepared.  The saukerkraut, butternut mashed potatoes, porkchops was so tasty - especially the sauce.  The portions were HUGE.  Our other friend ordered the tilapia and it came with 4 fillets and was quite tasty as well.For our 3rd course, we ordered desserts: Banana Foster bread pudding, Almond Toffee, Chocolate Bundt cake.  The bread pudding and bundt cake were so scrumptious.. the toffee was a bit hard to bite.  Even though we were stuffed at this point, we still had to put in a side order of the truffle fries.  I've had it once for brunch, and the fries again hit the spot.  Never go to HB without ordering those fries.I absolutely love this place, and can't wait to go to the new Hearty Boys up north."
"Hands down my favorite Chicago restaurant thus far.  Awesome atmosphere, stellar service, and great food.  Try the Wednesday pre-fixe menu to get a great taste of things at a reasonable price.Something about it just fired on all cylinders for me.  The entire experience is trendy and upscale without making a big fuss about it.  Remember, it's BYOB, so bring something nice and let your kind waiter/waitress fill up your glass accordingly."
"I took the lady pal here for our ONE YEAR ANNIVERSARY.  I had the strip steak, and it was amazing.  For an appetizer we had the artichoke and cheddar fritters (VERY good).  For dessert we split the Chocolate Bundt cake... it's to die for.The service at this place is excellent...and it is of course, BYOB."
"Okay, I was fully expecting to be disappointed, given all they hype & rave review about HB...instead I was blown away! Went with 3 girlfriends on a Wednesday night for the $30 3-course meal (of which you can select off their regulator menu - nice). Being with a group of 4, I got to try 4 appetizers, 2 salads, 4 entrees, and 2 desserts. My favorites:-fresh mozzarella appetizer-artichoke & Edam fritter-vegetable couscous-walleye-bread puddingFYI - you can also get an appetizer portion of the mussels.The place is small & can get loud. Because we were adding to the noise, it was perfect for us. Service was great (offered suggestions & opinions that were spot on). Fabulous food, laid-back atmosphere, great prices & the fact it is BYOB makes it even more affordable. Will absolutely be back!"
"This place had everything as far as I'm concerned. BYOB, adorable, sweet and attentive staff and fabulous food!  The mussels and steak frites? Perfect. Beets?  Well-played.  And again- our server was absolutely charming. The only piece that could have cost a half star were the artichoke and edamame fritters and I think it's because we just ended up not needing something that heavy.  I'm a Wicker Parker and this is my favorite reason to head up to the other side of town- just don't forget to stop by Kafka for a bottle or two first!"
"This place is hands down one of the best places to eat! Brunch is amazing, dinner is great - and dessert? Don't get me started!I come here often, and I've had plenty of things on their menu - from banana pancakes to crabcake benedict to artichoke fritters - to duck, rabbit risotto, pork chops, escargot, and a cupcake flight - I've not once been let down.And the guys and gals who work there are so friendly. I've always gotten in, even without a reservation, and I've been treated so well!BYOB means that your bill won't be too pricey - so bring  your own vino and drink up! But leave them a nice tip please."
Food is delicious - everything I've ever had here has been wonderful.  Very small so make a reservation - great byob date place.
"We had an excellent meal with excellent service.  BYOB is always a plus, especially if you know it before hand.  We didn't.  Our fault, but a quick run to Kafka by a new friend landed us a nice New Zealand Pinot to go along with our fabulous food (thanks again, by the way, if you're reading).  The chef gave us the rundown of the specials (there were a ton!).  We started with a venison and cognac pate served on mixed greens with sesame flatbread and a number of accouterments, including some great spicy dijon, sweet delicious beets, a tasty balsamic reduction, classic cornichons and pickled peal onions.  For my entree, I enjoyed a rich, hearty rabbit risotto which proceeded to knock my socks off.  Perfectly prepared.  My partner had a venison stew was laced with some wintry spices and herbs that made enjoying the tender, flavorful meat and carrots that much easier.  Dessert was a ""cupcake flight"" and made for a nice finish.  We split one order (three cupcakes) between the two of us and it was just enough.  The pumpkin cupcake with cream cheese frosting was slightly orgasmic.  I can't wait to go back!"
"Excellent!  Need I say more?  The place is cute, the staff is wonderful, and the food is great.  I went for the Wednesday nigh pre-fix (30$ for three courses).  Everything was top notch...and it's BYOB (with no corking fee) which makes a Wednesday night pretty darn cheap!  Please visit this place!"
"Went on a Wed night when they had the 3-course prix fixe for $30.  It was one of the best meals I've had in a very long time!  Appetizers - escargot and fritters - were both interesting and really really good.    Entrees - whole food stuff with sausage and shrimp and mussels - were also fantastic.  The fish had great flavors, and worked really well with the sausage (who would've thought?).  The desserts - bread pudding and some chocolate crisps - were good, but my least favorite of the entire meal.The wait staff was personable and attentive.  Service was a little slow, but given the fact that they were slammed and had people waiting out the door, I thought it was understandable.  And it's BYOB!"
"Took California visitors to this rest. last night for their prix fixe.  $29 for appetizer or salad, entree, and dessert on a Wednesday night.  We literally had to roll out of there.  I think the hit of the night was the lamb burger with truffle fries.  Amazing and equal to at least two full meals.  The vegetarian rigatoni dish was rich and delicious.  The herb stuffed game hen was moist and flavorful.  The mahi mahi was done perfectly with a light broth and perfect accompaniments.  The service was awesome, the wait staff were friendly and helpful.  We loved this place and will be back on a regular night because we were TOO stuffed!"
"If you are looking for an intimate dinner for two or a celebratory dinner for 13, then look no further than HB Restaurant.  A true hidden gem of Lakeview that will make you easily think you are in a very pricy New York City bistro.  The waitstaff is knowledgeable and they play great music for ambiance.  The only reason it didn't get five stars was because I was so busy talking with my friends that my meal was slightly cold by the time I was able to dig in."
"I went this past Saturday and I have to say I was so excited to go, however, I was so unimpressed with the menu. So dull and expected! i was floored. Not much to really to offer thats unusual or different. Repetitive I found. I had the Portabella with goat cheese, and tomatoes. Lifeless and the eggs absorbed the mushroom and goat flavor way to much.  The fries are ok. I mean, its just not overwhelming and pleasing. I would have like to seen a more diverse menu for lunch, at 12:30 in the afternoon people can move on from brunch related items. I have to say, next time I shall go to Nookies for breakfast.they try to hard."
"I visited this place for the second time last night and remembered why HB = Perfection. First, the atmosphere is totally cozy and potentially romantic (unless you're dining with your parents or an ugly friend). And it's a BYOB. Love this. The owner was so friendly and funny both times I went and the service straight up rocks. But let me get to the important part now: the food. The food at HB makes you want to look intently at your plate and command ""get into my tummy. now. Like, NOW."" It is truly delicious. I had the pork chop the first time I visited and last night I had a special I can't pronounce OR spell but consisted of pork, homemade sauerkraut, potatoes, and just enough of that sweet/salty taste that makes your mouth smile. My friend had a crabcake sandwich with greens and figs. It was also not the opposite of delicious. This may be my new favorite restaurant. For at least a week. I'm kind of fickle.Put on some comfortable shoes and book it to HB. Like, now. Just TRY not falling in love with this place. At the very least you'll develop a tiny crush."
"I love this joint ! I am not a food snob. But, I eat out 5 times a week. And have been doing so for 10 years in Chicago. And, in Home Bistro I have found my favorite spot. I really want to eat everything on this menu !! No joshin'."
"The food here was inventive and delicious.  I had the scallop and oxtail, which was a wonderful dinner dish, but a little too salty for my taste.  My friend and I shared a bread pudding, which really hit the spot.  I'm also a big fan of their staff.  The host was so welcoming to us.  It's BYOB there, so he asked if we brought any wine with us.  We hadn't, so he offered us basically a full bottle of wine that the previous patrons had left behind.  Fine by us!  HB is on the smaller side, so it's a great location for a heart-to-heart kind of dinner.  I would come back just to see what's new on their menu."
Great experience. Really friendly staff and a fun lively atmosphere. Everyone throughly enjoyed their dinners too!
"HB is a wonderful restaurant and we enjoyed every bit of it. The service was excellent. Our waiter was adorable and everyone seemed to keep an eye on us to make sure that we had what we needed. The food was delicious, all three of us enjoyed our entrees, we loved the dates and beets for appetizers and the dessert was amazing. We couldn't believe how affordable it was and will definitely return."
"My friends and I wanted to go to Kafka for a wine tasting event featuring vino from Italy.  The event was a great hit and we bought a bottle of the featured prosecco and an Argentine Malbec.  Happy with our purchases, we headed out to HB, excited about BYOB without any corkage fee.People might say HB is cozy.  Maybe even a tight squeeze.  Let's face it folks.  It's small.  It's a teeny weeny storefront restaurant that can barely accommodate 20 diners.  But for all the lack of space, the service and food is superb.  We were greeted warmly and seated right away.  The server was engaging, offering spot on suggestions.My friend stole bits of my escargot while I pilfered her mussels and frites.  The truffle sauce was absolutely yummy.  I had the sea bass with shrimp scampi.  The sea bass was HUGE, perfectly done - tender, juicy, and light.  The shrimp scampi was a bonus.  By the end of the meal, my friends and I were too full to even contemplate dessert.  But I know that this is definitely going to be a regular spot for me since it's so close by."
"Yummmm.  I went here the other night with some friends.  We got the artichoke fritters and the fried haloumi cheese, both of which were top notch.  And for hte main course I listened to the reviews and went with the beef brisket.  I was more than pleased.   Lots of good flavors and super-tender brisket.  We also tried the cherry bread pudding.  I liked it, but it didn't blow me away like the brisket.  Then again, I'm not a huge bread pudding fan as it is.And the best part is the BYOB.  Helps keep the bill down.Lastly, I would say that this is more of a date place.  The food was definitely delish, but it was only lit by candlelight and if a table had more than 2, it was clear that it was a double date."
"FREAKING AWESOME!!! remember its BYOB so bring your own wine and save the $$$Must try the seasonal Pork special. It was like a pork pie on top of creamy mash potatoes, with a flaky pie crust and yogurt on top. MMM. Also, loved the tiny sweet grapes mixed in!Finally, the BREAD PUDDING was the most delicious pudding I have ever had!!! GO GO GO GO there NOW."
"This is one of my favorite restaurants in the city.  Cozy, great food, and outstanding, friendly service.  What I love about this HB is that they have creative culinary taste while still staying true to their ""home bistro"" roots.  What makes this restaurant even more amazing is that you get delicious food for really reasonable prices which makes it the type of place you'll want to return to over and over and over (and over) again.  To top it all off, it's BYO!I should warn that this place wouldn't be ideal for any party larger than 4 and reservations are recommended.  Perfect for a date night!  You'll be sitting fairly close to others, but that doesn't bother me much.  Happy dining!"
"Just happened upon this place Saturday afternoon and I already want to go back.  The place is city-quaint, the staff charming and the food delectable.There were a few things on the menu that sounded amazing and I couldn't decide b/t breakfast and lunch...so, we ordered the beniegts to start...fried dough w/powdered sugar...what's not to liked!  I asked our waiter for inspiration...since one of my choices was a ""special"", he advised I should go with it.  Great advice...it was phenomenal...stuffed portobello sandwich w/truffled frites...YUM!!!  It was prepared a la burger on a pretzel roll...the mushroom, the stuffing, the roll...all good.  My bf got the apple and cheese  (forgot type) omelet...which came w/the infamous biscuit and strawberry butter.  He liked his meal, as well.HB is a great spot and has a great vibe...it could just as well be in NYC as Chicago."
"i've heard the hype, even the oooooo-s and the ahhhhhh-s when this place gets mentioned in casual conversation. not sure what took me so long but i finally gave HB a try for myself. it was spontaneous and somehow i managed to nab that last reservation for a friday night...friday morning. i was charmed from the moment i made that call. they'd shift things around and we could most certainly have the last 7:30 reservation. i like to think my dazzling personality had something to do with that streak of luck. truth is, they are probably just the nice guys they appeared to be in person. so what did we get?we started with some incredible bacon and walnut wrapped dates and one of the best beet salads to have ever graced my lips. next up - those mussels which lived up to everything i had heard from their admirers. the broth had a perfectly light beer base and they weren't fishy in the slightest. then it was seafood bouillabaisse filled with a variety of meaty creatures. mild, but tasty. then it was the dinner all-star. BRISKET. sounds very pedestrian at first. then you hear that it was soaked in ginger ale overnight and served with a parsnip/potato mash and drizzled with a jalapeno glaze. ummmm, yes please!with a menu this unique, there was no way we could turn down dessert. lemon and brown sugar bread pudding and a comped salted brownie which i believe came from my enthusiasm and wide eyes and its description. oh food. i love you. and HB, i'll be back soon. --ps - its BYOB and the dishes are priced completely reasonable. so that means you get an amazing meal and appropriately sauced up for less than most places. perfection."
Went here with two friends for NYE dinner. It was awesome! The food was amazing. The owner and the staff were so nice. I can't wait to go back.
"I just completely fell in love with this place!  We went for the $29 pre-fixe deal on Wednesday, and it was such a great deal.  Three courses for $29 and BYOB with no corkage fee?  Awesome!  Granted I am usually a little biased when it comes to BYOBs.  We started with the artichoke and Edam fritters...  SINFUL, positively sinful.  If you don't like fried food, don't order these puppies...  but who doesn't like fried food???  We also got the almond stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, very good, I felt a little like I could get them somewhere else, next time I'll try something different, but they were very good regardless.  My beau got the steak'n'eggs, advertised on the menu as skirt steak, but it was steak'n'eggs, they weren't fooling anyone, but it was tasty, a little on the salty side.  I had the lamb burger...  oh my...  in a word, wonderful.  I would go back for that alone.  And finally we concluded with dessert, a pear galette and a Ho-Ho...  Yeah a Ho-Ho, like the Little Debbie snacks, but WAY more refined and made with real ingredients, this thing didn't come out of a little foil packet.  I just couldn't help but chuckle thinking I was eating an adult Ho-Ho...  too funny.  All in all a great meal, ALTHOUGH, and this isn't worth knocking them a star because the food was so good, the presentation was a little lacking.  All the flavors of the food totally made up for it, however, I was a little shocked at all of the dishes when they came out, they smelled wonderful, tasted fantastic, but really just lacked visual appeal on the plate.  Its OK though, none of the food stayed on the plate for very long...  :o)"
"Each night before bed, I like to say a quick thanks to the man upstairs for my friends and family, surviving yet another day in our ever-declining economy, and Home Bistro's truffle fries with garlic aioli. Rarely have I experienced such intense culinary pleasure, and from fried potatoes, no less. Sigh. But moving on...HB is such a cozy little place with a great vibe and excellent food (my experience is with the mussels and rainbow trout...both solid options). Also, since it's BYOB (no corkage fee), you can get away with a great meal without paying an arm and a leg. Home Bistro, I like you so much, I am not even going to dock you a star for the time my visiting friend began feeling a bit queasy after downing your rabbit stew (because really, who orders rabbit stew? He was asking for it, as far as I'm concerned). Hats off to you and your amazingness, HB. I'm bummed that I don't make it to see you more often."
"I was a little torn about this review.  I mean, this place has over 300 reviews and it is rated an average of 4.5 stars overall!  Those are pretty impressive stats, right?!  You would think you are eating at one of the best restaurants in the city.That's why I'm torn - I just don't get it and I'm wondering if I'm missing something here.  I'm thinking that HB must have a serious, devout neighborhood following and support (which is great), but I don't think the food in and of itself could get this place up to a 4-5 star rating.First, let me say the service is good.  The waitstaff are pleasant and attentive.  The owner/chef is adorable.  And he is all over the place (cooking, serving as host, cleaning up tables), which I love.  I think it's great he is so involved with every aspect.  It is BYOB and the prices are very reasonable.  The restaurant itself is small, but intimate and well-done.However, I just didn't think the food was much better than average.  Here is a breakdown of what we had:Artichoke/Edam Fritters - was a bit greasy, tasted fine, but was nothing specialSeared Scallop in a mustard soup - fine, but I've had much betterQuail - fine, quail was tender, flavors didn't jump out at youBrisket - fine, brisket was well-prepared, flavorfulBread pudding - this was the real standout for me - the bread pudding was excellent and the side of marscapone is something I've never had with bread pudding before and it definitely was a phenomenal compliment to itSo, I can't say anything I had tasted bad - it didn't.  It just wasn't even close to the good restaurants/bistros I've been to, which is why I couldn't give it a higher rating.  However, I love supporting the local neighborhood places and I do recommend you go - if for nothing else but to see what all the buzz is about."
"Had brunch here recently and was very happy. Small but cozy, very friendly waitstaff, no wait on a Saturday around noon (although that might be attributable to the fact that it was zero degrees outside).Beignets were warm and crispy on the outside, soft and yummy on the inside. I had the Chorizo omelette which was also very good. Definitely try the strawberry butter on the biscuit that comes with every meal. It's like having strawberry ice cream for breakfast (only not as cold, thank heavens)."
"Amazing food, fabulous service and BYOB!!! What more could a girl ask for?! I've been here twice and both times the food has been amazing. It seems like their menu, although not very extensive, changes often and everything looks so good it's hard to choose! Great atmosphere for date night, a double date, or even a fun girls' night out!! And if you end up drinking the one bottle per person you didn't think you'd get through, you can stumble to Roscoe's afterwards for some fun dancing and a pitcher of pink vodka lemonade!"
What a great place. Called late Sat afternoon and still got a good reservation on a Sat night. The rabbit rissoto app was fantastic. We had the cornish hen and a whole bass special which were all good. Bread pudding for desert is a must. And who could beat BYO. Good service as well. My wife took her friends here a few weeks later for her Bday and her party of 10 had a great time.
"I liked this cute bistro, but it wasn't THAT good. The portions were way too big. My boyfriend and I were full after the bland fritters and boring caesar salad.The sauce for the mussels wasn't thick enough and had no body.The rustic decor is a plus while the music didn't fit at all."
"Although I really wanted to like this place, I've had two disappointing meals here. HB Restaurant doesn't come close to Mia Francesca or Socca, which have lower yelp scores but are far better venues for fine dining."
"Perhaps my favorite restaurant in Chicago- now that my husband and I have a baby, whenever we have a chance to go out, we try to go to HB.  Not only is the food unique and absolutely wonderful- the chef and front man (John Carl and Bob) are just really sweet, nice people who always remember you and are completely welcoming.  Bob - in addition to being a great host- is also a wonderful photographer, whose art hanging on the walls compliments the wonderful meals (my husband and I have even bought one of his pictures).  Another bonus is that it is BYOB - it makes this more affordable."
"How does it feel to come to a quaint, comfortable, byob bistro, where the chef himself comes to your table to present your meal.  It's awesome!  Some friends and I came here a few Wednesdays ago,  the portions are generous and the food was delicious.  A couple of us ordered the pri-fixe and our third member ordered off the menu. For starters, we tried the fried cheese and date appetizers.  The strawberry jam on the cheese sounds odd in theory, but the sweetness compliments the saltiness of the cheese.  The dates...how can you go wrong with bacon, very tasty.  For entrees,  I had the 'whole fish', which is exactly what it sounds like.  A roasted whitefish with vegetables in broth.  I also sampled my dining companions entrees, the mussels and chicken in phylo.  I liked the chicken in phylo better than the mussels, but I'm not really a mussels eater in the first place.  The chicken was wrapped up in phylo and served with couscous and a tangy sauce. (side note: all of the staff were very friendly and it was obvious that they take pride in their work.)The finale was shared carmel apple bread pudding and a chocolate ho-ho dessert.  The table argued about which was better, either way it's a win-win.  This place rocks."
"i rarely travel out of my home zone, especially on a sunday night, but given the stellar reviews i gladly made the trip to hb yesterday.  while we found the food pretty good on balance (not mind-blowing as the reviews suggest), the warm and inviting atmosphere of this restaurant make it a great choice.  clearly a lot of love and thought was put into making this restaurant feel charming and homey.  i loved the terra cotta colored walls, the wax covered wine bottles used as candlestick holders and the witty food-inspired quotes circling the top of the walls.  walking in i was immediately made to feel welcome by the front of the house staff, and quickly seated at a cozy window table.  my wine was opened and poured immediately.  a perfect way to start a pleasant meal.  although everything on the menu sounded delicious, our group of four chose - appetizers: the house-cured olives with apricot preserves, bacon-wrapped almond-stuffed dates and escargot.  the first two were delicious, the escargot was innovative but a little odd.  not the traditional butter and garlic preparation.  the snails were shelled and the sauce was more sweet than savory.  interesting but not really my thing.- salad: buttery croutons and super creamy dressing made the hb caesar almost too rich.- entrees: the pork belly and white beans was flavorful and rich.  the catfish with gumbo, however, was served on a very bland pool of what tasted like tomato sauce and was not at all what one would expect (spice! punchy southern flavors!) from the description.  (the other two of our foursome had the salmon with creamed corn and tomatoes, and the chicken confit.  i didn't hear any complaints.)-desserts: hoho was, well, a hoho.  too sweet for my taste.  the pear galette, however, was warm, delicate and oh so yummy.pretty good (3.5 stars) food  + charming atmosphere + attentive service + byob with no corkage = patrons guaranteed to return."
"Decided to go here with my man for a nice dinner ""on the town"".  Per the suggestions of my fellow Yelpsters, I made a reservation and Im really glad I did.  For a Thursday night this place was jumpin'!  The waitstaff was fantastic and attentive ( or as attentive as they could be given the busy evening).  We go the $29 special, which was an app, entree, and desert.  The portions were very generous, and everything was quite tasty.  This is an easy go to place for me and my man for now on!"
"4 1/2 stars for sure, The only reason why it's not 5 is because of the salt-happy chef but I dealt with it..on  with the review:I don't know if it was due the sheer joy that I and my girls shared (our friend announced her pregnancy) or If it was the 2 bottles of champagne but I definitely enjoyed the menu at HB.We made reservations in advance for Wednesday night. They offer $30 prix-fix  dinners on Wed. nights. And it's not some crappy selection that they choose for you, you can get whatever you want off the menu for $30 !!!!! How magical is that? Ok, I had the fritters(fried goodness)mussels(HUGE portion) AmAzInG!and the sour cherry bread pudding- no words can describe my taste buds after that one, the only thing, like I mentioned in the beginning is the frites that came along with my mussels were a tad on the salty side. Who cares, I loved it as did my friends.The staff? Unbelievably friendly. We called over our waiter and the end of dinner to give him a group hug.I must hand it to Lakeview/Boytown.Hb and the Chicago Diner across the street from eachother? I might as well move to the middle of the street.."
"Service was excellent on a Friday night my fiance and I were pleasantly surprised at this quaint little place in boystown. I will be back to have mussels and truffle fries for sure. BYOB is a plus as well. Had a porkbelly special, and it was prepared perfectly. the menu is approachable as others have indicated but with upscale/gourmet twists to all of it. Great spot and I will  be back."
"Cozy, intimate spot in Boystown. Super, creative, wonderful food. Beautiful presentation. Service is great and attentive. I've been there twice with girlfriends ...and loved it both times. Especially yummy -- porkchop over sweet potatoes (I think) and red cabbage (which I normally wouldn't pick), tilapia, almond stuffed dates with bacon for apps. I'd suggest making a rez since it's so small. BYOB."
"As an infrequent ""Yelper"", reserving reviews for extremes in either direction as time is scarce, I regret this review is so late in forthcoming. HB has managed to turn fine dining on its ear leaving the pretension at the door and just delivering dizzying good food with excellent service. Service is an art, a dance a symphony and when everything works in ""concert"" with the ingredients, the food and the presentation, it's magical. HB is indeed magical. This is creative, inspired and delicious cuisine. You will definitely need reservations on Thurs-Sat'. Menu changes frequently, specials come and go, and ingredients are seasonal. It is a BYOB so pick something up at WineStyles or bring a special bottle from home. This is not a large space, there are no Frette linens or Laguiole knives. This is not a chef's version of deconstructed, blow torched foam reduction or interpretation of pop tarts on a stick.... This is seriously great food, with great service in a very warm, inviting and cozy atmosphere. You will see people in jackets, not required. Enjoy."
"Mmmmmm!   Ok so this place is super cute!  Went there with a group of 6...8PM on a Friday...you know those super crazy BYOB places that have you so close to the next table that if you turn in their direction, you are breathing on their food...well this place is NOT like that.  It was nice to not be crazy crowded in.  So that was a plus.  Also, the service...IMPECABLE!  The waiter was so down to earth, not to mention the bus boys were on water like white on rice.  I love that.  I mean I just hate it when you are sitting there and your water is empty.  We had the fritters and some other shrimp dish for starters.  YUM!  Then we had salads...let me just say that the mixed greens salad is HUGE!  Its like a meal in itself.  I had the mussels, again very good and HUGE!  The thing that I didnt like was everything was great...however, everything was served with fries...weird.  Its like upscale and then not.  But still delicious all the same.  I would probably have given it 4 stars but the service deemed it 5...definitely worth a night out to dinner!"
"I went for the first time last week and had a great time. One of Chicagos best kept small  restaurants. Try the Brisket it will take you right back home.Great job guys, Keep up the good work!!!!!!!!Please open on Tuessdys!"
"Ok, so I use Yelp all the time to find places to go when I am travelling for food, haircuts, etc. but rarely write reviews. This restaurant has compelled me to give back to the Yelp community instead of continuing my parasitic ways....I can't say enough good things about HB.  Let's start with the atmosphere.  Small dining area with MAYBE 20 tables and all the art on the walls are photographs taken by one of the employees.  And the people working in the restaurant are fantastic.  From the moment I walked in the door they treated me almost as if I was an old friend coming to dinner at their house.  Everything was so absolutely friendly and completely unrushed.... there was no formality at all.  Just really comfortable conversations and interactions with all of the staff that we interacted with.Other details; we didn't have a reservation and it was a Prix Fixe Wednesday (had no idea of that before we came in).  But there was a just vacated table in the window that we got when we walked in.  It was the only table that came available over the next 30-40 minutes, so reservations might be a good idea.  Now, on to the food.... I had an escargot appetizer that was an excellent combination with garlic, tomatoes, mandarin oranges and who knows what else. I certainly didn't leave any of the ingredients on the plate.  My main course was a salmon dish that was somewhat boring in the first bite when all I got was the fish. But as I got further into the dish and got mouthfuls that included polenta and all the other things included in the dish this went from a non-descript piece of salmon to a very complete and satisfying main course which was full of flavor.  For desert they were out of my first choice (an apple crumble) but they did have bread pudding on the menu. I'm a fan of bread pudding but really dislike deserts that have strong alcoholic flavors.  I asked our server what she thought about the level of brandy in the bread pudding and she said she didn't think it was too strong, but would bring me something else if I decided I didn't like it.  I went with it and ended up EXTREMELY happy.  It was the perfect end to a great meal.  Oh, and one other thing I have to mention... if you get something that comes with the truffle oil french fries they will forever change the way you think of french fries.  These were incredible.So in summary, great food, incredibly friendly atmosphere, great value with the Prix Fixe menu... I can't think of a single critique!  GREAT job HB and staff!"
"It has been interesting to watch this place transform over the years.  Remember back in the day when it was run and open off and on by some beatnic poet guy?  He made some good omeletes.Its been great to watch the Hearty Boys open their place here, first as catering, then brearkfast/coffee spot and now more upscale dinner/brunch restaurant.  I have been here many times and always enjoyed the food and atmosphere. The servers are friendly and food interesting.  Our brunch favorite is the strawberry butter which is simply delish on their soft buttery biscuits.  Wish I had more time to dine here more often!"
"Lamb Burgers were delish says the meat eating boyfriend. I took down some fritters (oh my goodness delish), Risotto, and a few (million!) of his truffle fries. The service was awesome, though we did get odd looks for not taking advantage of the BYOB service.  Wish we had room for dessert but alas, even with taking food home, I was too stuffed. Very cute decor, ambiance is nice. It is a big costly for the portion size... the only reason I give it a 4. Save it for special occasions."
Yep awesome.  Cheap and very tasty.
"I found HB on Yelp after searching BYOB in Lakeview. After reading all the stellar reviews, I was pretty excited to try it out. I went with three girlfriends on a Friday night. We didn't get a reservation until Friday afternoon, which was no problem. The staff are extremely friendly and attentive. Our waiter snatched up our bottle of white wine to chill it so fast that we thought we had forgotten it at home! We stayed well past our meal drinking wine and felt NO pressure to leave. The decor of the restaurant is charming and the atmosphere is lively. Perfect for a night out with the girls or a date. I insisted that we start with the bacon-wrapped almond-stuffed dates after reading the reviews,and they did not disapoint. We also ordered one of their award-winning ductch apps (can't recall the name) that was basically a combo of brioche bread, a fried egg, thick bacon, gouda cheese and greens with balsamic. It was sooo yummy! I didn't want to share! For entrees we ordered the chicken, grouper, salmon and the full trout they had on special. I had the trout and it was delicious and HUGE! I was a little concerned about the bones, but the waiter filleted it for me in the kitchen and I only found one bone in this entire fish. It had this awesome morocan curry sauce on it that was out of this world. All of my friends agreed it was the best thing ordered. The grouper was just OK and a little small, but the chicken and salmon were also delish. On to dessert! After this amazing meal, there was no way we were skimping on dessert. We ordered the lemon caramel bread pudding and a molten chocolate cake. Both were amazing of course, but I especially dug the bread pudding. Overall I was very impressed by HB and am plotting my next visit!"
"A great BYOB spot when you're in the mood for something different.  I love it for entertaining out of town guests.  Small restaurant, takes reservations and inventive menu.  Loved the pork chop and seafood stew.  We have been several times and the service is really improving.  Try it!UPDATE: While management has changed, the executive chef is the new owner.  Among some of the nicer changes, the restaurant has introduced a three-course prix fix menu -- with variety to boot!  Not to mention, on Thursdays during the summer, they serve all you can eat Maryland crab.  We haven't made it yet, but will be trying to get there in August before the crab runs out.  The only true negative is that the service can get a bit slow at times and sometimes you almost need to flag down your server.  But the food more than makes up for the potential service issues."
"YUM! I've been to HB for dinner on a regular (weeknight and weekend) evening two times and for a private party that closed the restaurant to the public and both experiences were fantastic. Pleasant servers who know their stuff and an enticing menu. IThis tiny little storefront restaurant is cozy and deeeeelicious! Between my three visits I've had the lentil soup twice and it's great. Definitely do yourself a favor & get the halloumi cheese dish, it's still a wonder to me how this cheese can be grilled without melting but the firm texture & salty flavor (similar but not as salty or crumbly as feta) knock it out of the park every time. For entrees I've had the grouper nicoise which was scrumptious and the vegetable and ricotta pie which is vegetarian comfort food at it's finest. my boyfriend and other dining companions have enjoyed every other dish on the menu so it seems like you can't go wrong!"
"From the moment we walked in, it was just delightful.  I love when people love what they do, and the people at HB are so contagiously enthusiastic about their food.  My dining companions and I had 1) Bacon Wrapped Dates (possibly my favorite part of the meal) 2) Artichoke and Edam Fritters (tasty but compared to everything else, not anyone's favorite at the table) 3) Wild Boar (off menu, last serving!) 4) Pork Bellies (the grits and cherries were so amazing.  Creamy and perfectly complimentary to the meat 4) The 12 hour brisket. (No teeth required.  So tender and mild!)We finished with a chocolate bar with sun dried cherries/sea salt/chili peppers, and the quince and honey bread pudding (right up there with the dates in my estimation.)  I have had more expensive less impressive food, and this place was worth every penny.Remember to BYOB!  No corkage."
"Fun place run by the Hearty Boys Caterers, Dan Smith and Steve McDonagh. Brunch is a must. Had the Pumpkin Pancakes and shared the Beignets.I would order the Pumpkin Pancakes over nearly every sweet breakfast item in Chicago."
"After hearing about HB from a few friends, we decided it was time to try it for ourselves. I love love loved it and enjoyed the food, experience, Joncarl (owner), service and pretty much everything else about the place. We decided to share 3 appetizers (fritters, escargot and bacon wrapped almond dates) and the special entree (bouillon base loaded with seafood: flaky whitefish, shrimp, mussels and clams). Everything was fantastic and we had a great time getting to know Joncarl and his inspiration for the restaurant. It's a place to go with friends, family or on a romantic date. The artwork is amazing and is on display throughout the entire place. Joncarl and I shared a sip of champagne and he was kind enough to share a Polish after dinner drink with us. I can't wait to go back for round II and recommend HB without reservation."
I loved HB!  The mussels and frites are top notch and very filling.  The ambiance is nice and the BYOB aspect makes it a place I will certainly be returning to. I would recommend this place to anyone!
"Umm it just wasn't what I expected it to be at all! After reading the reviews to this place I was expecting culinary talent and after the experience I felt like I had been tricked. First of all and foremost the service was awful at 8:00 pm on a Friday night. To get service was kinda like looking for a whale on a whale excursion, you barely saw him aka waiter. I got my appetizer with my dinner because he forgot to enter it in the computer, I find that amateur and should never happen! All the entrees were just lacking in overall flavor. Nothing came close to setting it over the top and we all have had way better for the money. The fried oysters set on grits, dates with bacon (hard to mess up) and fries with garlic aoli (hard to mess up) were the best part of the dinner and were good. I was with three people and all three of us are not snobby or make much money but we all thought this place was a sheep dressed in wolfs clothing ...we were not impressed at all. Another example was my brothers dish which was the gnocchi ...it came out BURNT. He's a cook at Girl and the Goat and when he asked them about it they said it's supposed to taste like toast. Really? Burnt Toast? I don't think so. If it weren't for the BYOB feature and awesome location I would think that this place wouldn't survive anywhere else in the city. It was a big let down because due to the ratings I thought I was in for a treat but was definitely mistaken."
"If you want a great local place to make your new stand by restaurant this is the place.  The space is fairly small (20-30 tables) and has a great relaxing comfortable vibe.  The owners and wait staff are knowledgeable and attentive.  Their menu has enough variety without offering too many choices and it changes every 3 weeks based on the best seasonal ingredients.  Dishes I would recommend include their whitefish with Moroccan spices, braised pork shoulder and any dish with their creamy rich au gratin potatoes.  Also, the bread pudding was very well done, moist and sweet, a great finishing touch to the meal.  If you go don't forget to bring your own wine, Kafka Wine Co one block south on Halsted has a good affordable selection."
"My friends and I were seated right in front of the restaurant by the window.  I heard so much about their truffle fries, so I ordered a side order of them and just thought they were okay. . .  nothing special.  As an appetizer, we ordered the bacon-wrapped dates, which never disappoint.  As for the entree, I ordered the salmon which could have been more flavorful."
"We were at least 10 minutes late to our reservation and instead of giving us the evil eye, the hostess graciously led us to the set table waiting for us. I was surprised they kept the table open and didn't show any disapproval with our tardiness because HB is quite small and every table counts. The food was spectacular! We ordered the favorites such as mussels and the salmon dish. All the seasoning came together nicely and the seafood was very fresh. Everythng on the menu sounds good and we all had trouble deciding on what to order. The restaurant itself is actually pretty romantic with candles surrounding the entire restaurant. HB is BYOB, don't forget to bring your liquor to accompany the good food!"
"For some reason, I always forget how much I love HB. I came here last night for dinner and was once again impressed. The service was friendly, as always, and the food seemed even better than usual. I got the skate over polenta; it was a simple preparation but the fish was incredibly fresh and perfectly cooked. I was embarrassed when I realized that I had devoured the whole thing before everyone I was with had even finished half of their dishes! Aside from the skate, the mussels with truffle fries are to die for and my friends and I have started referring to the bacon wrapped dates as ""little bites of heaven."" The BYOB policy is an added plus!"
"This place is clearly amazing. My fiance and I were looking on Yelp to try and find a new and good restaurant in our area, and this one was so highly rated, we wanted to check it out. First of all, the service was great. They give you bread to start, and we did not have to wait very long for our food. We got to meet the chef, and he often came out to check and see how we liked everything. We liked supporting a small business.Even more importantly than the service, the food was wonderful. We started out eating those almond figs wrapped in bacon, and I almost died they were so good. Then, we ate the crab cake with this really great hot pepper sauce. For our main dish, we split the grouper in red sauce with oysters, and there was more than enough for the two of us. To finish off, we split the bread pudding, which is my new favorite dessert ever. They put heavy cream on top and the whole thing just melts in your mouth. We will definitely be back!"
"I love this place! It is super adorable - a great date restaurant. We started with the bacon wrapped dates which were fantastic. Stuffed with almonds which was very unique. Then moved onto the Pork Osso Buco with creamy polenta. My fiance had the lamb burger which he really enjoyed (on a pretzel bun which gave great flavor). Dishes are a bit on the pricy side, but worth it! Generous portions, delicious quality ingredients. Plus it's BYOB so overall not too bad. Definitely a fan!"
"My favorite neighborhood restaurant.  I tend to be a semi picky eater and I have yet to have a meal that I didn't love.  The owner/chef and his partner are so warm and welcoming.  I always enjoy talking with them, the owner is out and about all the time talking to people and I love that.  About 3 weeks ago we had made dinner reservations at another restaurant and the restaurant had a power outage and had to cancel our reservation.  We were bummed because we were celebrating our anniversary.  I call HB and they were able to squeeze us in.  The owners partner remember us and was so great to us, he knew that it was our anniversary and he brought a candle out in our desert and wish us a happy anniversary.  This is an amazing place, great food, great staff and a wonder ambiance.  I highly recommend this place to anyone, you will not be disappointed."
"I LOVED this place!!!!!   We arrived very early, around 6:00pm. The owners were having a glass of champagne. That just set the tone for us. Immediately we felt a connection to them. They both had such infectious and fun personalities. I also loved the decor of the room.  It is small and intimate and artfully decorated.        When I'm choosing a restaurant I look at 3 things. 1.) Price  2.) atmosphere and 3.) food quality.  I found all three at HB restaurant.  The entree prices are not inexpensive, but it's a BYOB so that more than makes up for it. I loved the atmosphere. I really felt like I had been invited to the chef's home for dinner. The owners are the ones that made my experience so much fun. I would go back just to see them again. The food was exceptionally good and the portions are large. The only thing I would change is the bread they brought out before the meal. I would rather have a crunchy french bread or flat bread.     We left around 8:00pm and every table was full. It became very lively and a had different vibe.    All in all we loved this place and will be back often. You cannot go wrong dining at HB restaurant."
"I rooted for them on the Food Network--and was delighted to see some boys from Chicago win.That being said, their TV show tries too hard and is as ""eh"" as the food they serve at HB.  Sorry, but it's really nothing that special.  Not bad, but not that great either."
"We had a large group there tonight and were treated to a family-style, multi-course meal of the chef's choosing. It felt like we were in his own home! Everything was fresh from the market, prepared exquisitely and absolutely fantastic. We can't wait to go back."
"A dinner at HB weeks before I moved to Chicago for good was one of the sure signs I wouldn't die of culinary deprivation after moving away from New York City.My boyfriend took me for dinner after I got my job offer; we took a lovely bottle of sparkling wine and went all out with our meal. It's been long enough now that I can't remember exactly what we had, but I can say we had the bacon-wrapped dates (orgasmic) and an appetizer special that was also moan-inducing.Boyfriend got some kind of tiny bird for his entree, and I had the tilapia. It was lovely, even though I don't normally like fish. It was served on a bed of flageolet beans but included raisins in the preparation. I can't turn down an odd combination like fish and dried fruit.I was so stuffed by the time dessert rolled around that I could barely eat two bites, but the pie hole must be satisfied: We ordered something chocolatey that was irrefutably delicious but nearly made me vomit from the sheer volume of food I'd consumed.The food wasn't memorable four months later, but I'll never forget walking out of the bathroom (which was beautifully appointed for a water closet, art for sale and all that) and overhearing the staff talking about their former lives in New York. I stood IN THE KITCHEN talking with them about our old stomping grounds for almost 10 minutes. By the time I returned to the table, my boyfriend thought I'd fallen in, but I was glowing, knowing I'd made a couple of fast friends in the restaurant business.Sweet staff all the way around; I think our server would have told us everything he loved about each dish on the menu if he hadn't had any other tables.I've tried HB for brunch as well (the day of the ill-fated Chicago Marathon, I gorged myself instead of passing out in the unseasonable heat) and it was equally delicious. Hearty and Southern-style satisfying, and nothing beats a mix-it-yourself mimosa."
"I love this restaurant. Great Food, impeccable service, wonderful atmosphere and it's byob which keeps the cost of eating out down. I loved everything from appetizer to dessert and so did my dining partner. We'll both be back."
"This place is phenomenal -- a BYOB with 5-star cuisine, which you gotta love. Though I must confess I did experience two blunders on my last visit that remove 1/2 a star. The food is really well-prepared and delicious, with so many mouth-watering options it's always hard to choose. The artichoke fritters are delumptious and the risotto fantastically creamy and well-seasoned. I've also enjoyed salmon and once a vegetarian version of another special, which the chef happily prepared. My only complaint was: stale focaccia, which they serve instead of bread...why? And, my friends had ordered the lamb special which neither was happy with. But...the server joyfully replaced it with the lamb burger which brought them both to near ecstasy. Desserts (if you have room) are always a treat."
"This place was an easy four star review.  I'll use my standard format:The Space:  This is basically the only reason HB didn't get 5 stars.  The space is a fairly unassuming storefront in the epicenter of a bustling boys'-town neighborhood.  It's clean, fun, and just swanky enough, but quite honestly it was LOUD.  My wife and I could barely hear each other.  There was a large group in there, but I imagine there would have been people at all those tables if the group weren't there, so that doesn't change it for me.  Definitely not a place I would bring a first date or someone for a ""serious conversation.""   The decor, however, is quite nice, with framed black & white photographs all over that were taken by the Front of House manager, who was on-site when we were there.  His photo work is excellent, and there are non-invasive signs giving you the web address if you want to buy some of his work.The Service:  Our waiter was friendly, knowledgable, helpful with an ice bucket (for the vino), etc., but it almost seemed like he was working in fast-forward.  I don't know if he just wanted to turn our two-top over one more time before closing (our res was for 7:45 on Saturday and we were on time) or what, but we had to make a deliberate effort to slow down, lest we find ourselves home by 9 on a Saturday night.  Again, very friendly, very helpful, I just felt a little rushed.  Once we slowed down, and we did linger over wint at the end of the meal, there was no problem.  I think I'm making a mountain out of a mole hill here, so I'll move on...The Food:  Oh, the food.  This is really good food.  We've eaten at a lot of the ""Contemporary American"" type places in the city (see Chalkboard, Sola, Erwin, Deleece reviews on my page), and this food stands up to any of them.  The Artichoke and Gruyere fritters made a little bit of pee come out when I tasted them.  They're not greasy, full of 'choke flavor, and oozing with cheese.  I'm not sure you could make them any better.  Wife had the soft shell crabs, the nightly special.  There were 2 crabs, lightly fried, and served on a fresh salad of melon, pickled onions, etc.  I don't even like crab much at all, but tried it and they were fantastic.  I had the smoked duck sausage with white beans, candied bacon, and spicy mustard.  Yum.  I was practically licking the plate clean by the time I finished.  For dessert we had the bread pudding made with pineapple, which scared me at first, but proved a sublime mix of smooth, sweet, and tart.  I was afraid it would taste like some pineapple filling that comes out of a can, but they were using all fresh pineapple, and it worked beautifully.  That's what we had last weekend, and I can't wait to go back for a few of the other items on the menu.  Another thing we noticed was that, like Chalkboard, they don't have any salt or pepper on the table.  I like the confidence it exudes when you say ""my food is good enough, my customers don't need to season it themselves.""  And I'll be honest, I never even thought to look for salt or pepper until my wife pointed it out after dinner.  Truly, good stuff.  So if you're looking for a romantic date (with a guy or a girl), don't do this on a weekend.  But if you're looking for top-noch fare and a good time with friends, this could be your new go-to spot.  And, hey, if you like to go on dates on Tuesdays, I'm sure it will be great.  Maybe we'll see you there!"
Absolutely delicious and a great value.  The waitstaff as well as the chef (who sat at our table briefly to chat after we finished our meal) were charming and attentive.  The interior is stylish and chic.  Can't beat BYOB without a corkage fee.  My friend and I left absolutely stuffed and I can't wait for my next visit!
"My sister & I came for the 2 for $50 crab bake on Thursday night.  It was absolutely heavenly & a great deal for the money!  You begin with an iceberg lettuce wedge, then they bring you foccacia & fresh roasted corn.  After you tackle all that can you begin eating the crab entree.Between the two people, you get 20 crabs.  Prepare to get down & dirty!  I was completely covered in crab juice (as I am sure were my neighbors) by the end.  We wrapped our evening with the cupcake flight.Service was excellent!  Our servers were very attentive & friendly, & they even explained to us how to devour the crabs.The brunch menu looks really yummy as well, so hopefully I can convince my husband to stop by on the weekend to check it out."
"A couple of weeks ago, my in laws took us to HB for my husband's birthday. As we were walking to the restaurant, I wasn't sure if they would like, but had heard such great things so I was really excited.  Overall, it lived up to my expectations. We started with an artichoke fritter desert which was outstanding. I was really looking forward to trying the bacon wrapped dates, but would've had to eat them alone. Next, I ordered a dinner salad which was fine. For my main course, I decided to go with the mussels and they were amazing!!! I've been on a mussel kick lately and they were really so flavorful.  As an added plus, they came with delicious truffle fries. The rest of the table went with the brisket which was also very good.  I must say, this is one of the better restaurants I have been to lately. The only thing that brought it down to 4 stars was the noise level.  Since it is a smaller restaurant, it was a little loud. Overall, I loved it and can't wait to go back! Oh, and its byob which is also great."
"I concur with the others that Home Bistro is tip top. From the intimate decor, to the delightful and quirky service to the cuisine. It all coalesces to offer an outstanding experience. The overall theme is one of detail, so you have to be in the mindset to absorb it all. From the customized menu, to the photos, to the knots in the floor. We shared a good number of apps and split a lamb burger amongst a party of three. This allowed for maximum sampling, wine sipping and a thoroughly enjoyable evening."
I live 4 blocks from this place and just got there for the first time and am beating myself up for not trying it sooner.  Food is real food and quite creative without being silly.  Staff is sweet and friendly.   It's noisy but I'm old so that's how it is -- will be happy to go back and enjoy more yummy food.
"Lovely establishment! The lamb burger was heaven and the service was fantastic. I admit I was a little tipsy when I got there, so I don't remember much of the details, but I do remember it being a great experience, even with our large party on a Saturday. Make sure to call in a reservation though!"
"i almost forgot how friendly Lakeview was...way back in '04 I lived there and enjoyed the friendly atmosphere and the absence of honks and yells. boyf and i stopped into HB for Sunday brunch - on our new kick (year running now) of trying to find new brunch spots - after reading some great reviews, i convinced the boyf to drive way way north (well not really). when i mentioned that they had truffle fries, he was sold.we strolled in at 1pm, no wait, got a 2-seater in the middle of the restaurant - it's the tiniest place, but real cute. the hostess/server was very welcoming and the other server that came by to take our plates later was so nice and suggested we try their dinner, which he claims ""they do better than brunch."" but really, the brunch was great! boyf got the deep fried french toast, holy crunchy greaseness with massive amounts of whipped cream on top - enough to kill a lactose intolerant. each bite was heaven in my mouth (until i remembered how many calories this could be!). i ordered the scrambled eggs with portabellos and goat cheese, with potatoes and a biscuit and honey butter - real yum and not too huge of a portion, which helps me from over eating (thank you HB).the only downer was that they were out of the matzo egg dish with salmon and all of the specials and out of half & half, so i had to drink my coffee black and i'm not a fan of that. but we did come in for brunch at 1pm...so that could explain it.before we left we checked out the dinner menu and saw some things we liked (lots of middle eastern influence) and decided we would come back (it's BYOB too). on our way out boyf asked a lady who was eating a big bowl of steamed mussels, how they were, and she proceeded to give him a mussel. it was hilarious - ""here put your hand out, try them!"" god, lakeview inhabits the nicest people...even mussel sharers."
I've been to HB a few times now and every time I have been nothing less than impressed! The staff is extremely accommodating and the food is delicious! Be sure to order the mussels!
"I was recommended to this restaurant by another restaurant owner.  I don't usually dine out in this part of town, but after the accolades by another fellow chef, I had to trek to LP.  The mussels are just spectacular.  I wish the portion was smaller cuz I hated leaving them unfinished, so share them if you order them.  The desserts are amazing and the staff is so kissable.  I wanna make out with everyone that works there - they are soooo sweet."
"Unfortunately, this restaurant does not accommodate parties greater than 6 on the weekends.  I called many weeks in advance requesting an exception for a very special occasion and they would not budge.  Not my idea of great customer service."
"My meal : bacon-wrapped dates, tilapia, and bananas foster bread pudding. Each item was delicious, and the tilapia was darn near perfection. Cleaned my plate. Friends and family I've taken here have also had the lamb burgers and specials and always rave. Excellent service as well. BYOB - get wine down the street at Kafka!"
An all around great option for dinner....byob and bacon wrapped dates
