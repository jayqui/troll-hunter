Parachute
"It took me too long to make it to Parachute. Maybe because it's a small place and can be tough to get a dinner reservation. I'm happy I finally made it. They do an excellent job bring Korean flavor and ingredients to their menu.The menu wasn't very long, but I wanted to try almost everything. Ordering the bing bread was a no brainer - if it's not already, this should be parachute's signature dish. We also tried the tempura sesame leaves, which were ok but I would try something else if I could do it all over.For the rest of the meal we tried the pork pancake, which looks like it has evolved over time based on other's photos here but has ended up somewhere great. Then the salmon salad, which was OK but I didn't love the presentation, would have preferred if it was somehow easier to get some of everything in one bite. And finally, the lamb ribs, which were knock-out good, fatty, smoky, and delicious served with fresh mint leaves that soak up the juices.Service was very helpful, steered us through the menu and drink list, made sure we were happy.I want to come back and bring friends!"
"I was excited- I was really excited about eating at Parachute- especially from all of the reviews and hype... I love Korean food especially anju Korean bar food. My best friends are Korean I have eaten in their homes in Korea- so when I heard a contemporary Korean restaurant was in the neighborhood I was excited-I was really excited-maybe too excited. I went in wanting to love it. I even thought okay maybe the appetizer, bachu-jeon (pancake) was just off- but when when you turn my favorite dish, dukbokki into a bland pile of rice cake, I take offense! I could have defrosted a bag from H-MART and enjoyed it more. The bread was good and the makoli was great. I will never stray from the restaurant Dancen again..."
"I've been here twice, soon after they opened and more recently this week. The food is really creative and delicious, after trying around a dozen dishes I can't say there was one I didn't enjoy. Bing bread, dukbokki with lamb sausage, pork belly pancake, beef ribs, and pickled chayote were my favorites on the most recent visit. Drink selection is slim on beer, but there are maybe 10 options, including an exclusive draft from Illuminated Brew Works. Trabanco sidra was my #2 alternative, and we also shared a bottle of locally brewed makegolli, which tasted like rice milk and tart green apple. Due to their popularity, the uber-trendy crowd leaves something to be desired, but the place is great. Reservations are pretty mandatory unless you show up right when they open or very late."
"I was extremely excited to hear that Beverly Kim, a promising contestant from Top Chef, has decided to open her own upscale Korean restaurant.  I thought this was a perfect place to bring my friend for her birthday.  I made reservations for 7:00pm on a Friday evening for a party of 4 (3 adults and 1 child).  Once we arrived, we still had to wait about 15 mins before being seated.  It didn't really bother us much.Once seated, we were given menus and water.  Our waitress came by shortly to explain how the menu is set up and recommended a couple of dishes.  We went with 2 smaller dishes and 3 entrees:Small Dishes:Baked Potato Bing Bread: stuffed with bacon and scallions served with a side of sour cream butter.  We opted for a half order which came with 4 pieces.  The bacon and the scallions brought a nice smoky flavor while the sour cream butter brought a slight acidity to the light and fluffy bread.  Overall, this dish gave a nice unique flavor to the palate. House Pickles, Kimchi with Chili Chayote, and Watermelon Radish Zuke. These dishes didn't impress me, but they weren't bad.  Seeing that pickles, kimchi, and radishes are Korean banchan staples, I was glad to see they were still good with all the different additions.   Entrees:Pork Belly and Mung Bean Pancake: served with kimchi, black garlic, hen egg, and pineapple.  I'm not a huge pork belly fan, but this entrée was delicious.  I enjoyed all the different textures and flavors this entrée had to offer.  Remember to eat all the different ingredients in one bite to get the full experience; it can get a little salty if you try to decompose it.Dukbokki: served with mushrooms, dried beef, angelica, and perilla seeds.  This dish was a little disappointing.  The rice noodles were cooked perfectly, but I found this dish to lack flavor.Spicy Beef Hot Pot: wheat noodles, tendon, black radish, clams, leeks, egg, and wild fern.  The aroma of this entrée from the table next to us smelled amazing, so we decided to order it.  Once we tasted the hot pot, we were left with nothing but disappointment.  The noodles and clams were overcooked which made the noodles mushy and the clams chewy.  There was also something lacking in the broth; we only tasted spiciness to it.  The wait staff was genuinely nice, but service was a tad slow.  They took a while to come get our orders, but the dishes came out exceptionally quick.  I also would have liked if our waitress was a bit more attentive; such as clearing away the dishes and refilling our water.  Overall, I have mixed emotions for Parachute.  I loved the idea of upscale Korean food, but there was nothing extraordinary about the dishes.  Also, with opening an upscale Korean restaurant the service has to be on point."
"Great place! I loved the service, engaged yet homey atmosphere, and good food. Even though it could get a little crowded, the whole vibe of the place was really trendy. It's almost like a hidden gem. We made reservations beforehand for a Wednesday @ 5:00pm. This place was booked until 9:00pm so I suggest making a reservation earlier in the day or rather the day before. There were only two of us, so we ordered what we thought we could handle - we were right to do so because we got very full. I recommend going with a group of people because the way this place is set up is order to share. Service was really great as well. They were so nice and made sure we were well taken care of. We had the Baked Potato Bing Bread to start, the Pork Belly and Mung Bean Pancake and Dolsot Bi Bim Bop as entrees, and Cocktails #2 and #3 and also Fentiman's Curiosity Cola for our drinks.  The Baked Potato Bing Bread - bacon, scallion, sour cream butterThis was a good way to start our meal. I was really hungry so it was a little bit heavier - hello, it's potato and bread. Luckily, we only ordered a half order of this so it was a good amount. Pork Belly and Mung Bean Pancake - kimchi, black garlic, hen egg, pineappleFor me, the pineapple and the pork belly really made this dish stand out! I thought it was lacking in kimchi but the different tastes in this dish were superb. You need to try to eat all of the ingredients together to get the full effect. I highly recommend this dish! Dolsot Bi Bim Bop - albacore, escarole, preserved lemon, barbecued onion, seaweed, soft eggI love bi bim bop, but I didn't love this dish. It was good at best, and overpriced for what you're getting. I would skip out on this and get Bi Bim Bop from a korean restaurant for half the price. I could hardly taste any egg, but the barbecued onion was insanely sweet. You could definitely taste the seaweed. Cocktail #2 - Medley Bros Whiskey sour, rooibos, amaroThis was delicious. A little bit stronger for some, but this drink was really good. I could tell why this place is known for their cocktails. Personally, I don't think you could go wrong with a Whiskey sour, but I really think their bartender was working some magic when he made this drink. I think adding rooibos was a genius move. Cocktail #3 - C&K Immature Brandy, yujacha, lemon, egg whiteA cocktail with egg white. It was a little bit too frothy but this drink was also outstanding. The taste is really familiar but I just can't seem to put my finger on it. If you're planning on trying a different cocktail, this is the one I would recommend. Fentiman's Curiosity ColaThis had no description. I really didn't like this drink at all. I only got it because the waiter said he liked it, but it kind of had an old taste to it. Have you ever been to The House on the Rock? Yeah, that's what this drink tasted like. Luckily, our waiter was so nice that he didn't mind changing my drink."
"Oh, Parachute, you were one entree away from meeting the super high standards I had set for you. Nonetheless, dinner was all in all a pretty delicious meal. It was super weird being seated (squeezed?) in between two parties, one on either side of us and this took some getting used to at first (probably also because I like my personal space and freak out with randoes too close to me)...but eventually it was okay. Though I still prefer a tad more space in between parties...but then, the food almost made up for it: Baked potato bing bread - The basis of this is similar to your Chinese chong you bing (green scallion pancake) or actually, it's more like a da bing (a thicker green scallion pancake) but with more ingredients incorporated. The potato, bacon, and the sour cream butter added to the more traditional scallions gave the bread a SUPER interesting twist. Go for the whole instead of the half!Pork belly with mung bean pancake - Mmmm delicious! I loved the pineapple and egg on top of the pork belly and the fresh veggies that topped it off. The pork belly was so soft and melts amazingly in your mouth.  Tofu ""ricotta"" mandu - So this was the one dish that left me very (extremely) confused. It was nothing like what I expected from a mandu dish - thinking dumpling/potsticker-like. The flavors sounded interesting on paper but when I tried it, I was really not a fan of the infusion of green curry, coconut, and pistachios. On top of that, the tofu ricotta filling in the mandu kind of killed it for me completely. Luckily, we had another amazing dish, perhaps my favorite of the night (thanks for selecting it for us!) - the Pork neck with artichoke and crispy shiitake mushrooms. I don't think I've ever had pork neck before but the cuts here were tender and juicy. I LOVED the artichokes and the little bit of juice that was in this dish. Only wish there was more!! So close to a perfect meal. It almost makes me sad to give Parachute a 4 but it's hard to overlook that mandu! Other than that, good service but the food took some time to come out. Oh, and they take reservations now!"
We came on a Saturday night and the place was very busy. Thankfully we had reservations.  Their policy is not to seat you until your entire party is there. Just an FYI if you have friends that have problems showing up on time.We opted to order some dishes to share. Here is what we ordered:Baked potato bing breadPork belly and mung bean pancakeDolsot bi bim bapDukbokkiCevicheMy favorite was the baked potato bing bread and the dukbokki.  But when I left here I did not feel full because their portions are not very large.  You can definitely get more portions at cheaper prices at a regular traditional Korean restaurant.The restaurant was easy to get to via the Blue line and #77 bus.
"There was a lot of hype building up in my circle of friends regarding this place. ""Best new restaurant, James Beard finalist, Korean/American fusion"". It may have raised the expectations a little bit too high.Nothing that we ordered here really blew us away. Many people suggested ordering the bing bread, which tasted okay, but didn't stand out to us.  We had also ordered the pork belly and mung bean pancakes, which were small, but flavorful enough.  The bibimbap was possibly the most disappointing order; the ingredients used did not go together well, in my opinion.  The kalbi dish was the one I was most looking forward to, but that also ended up falling short of expectations.  Not enough flavor.The dukbokki dish was very different from what I expected. Initially, I really liked the rice cakes, but the lack of overall flavor just doesn't cut it.The one dish that truly stood out to us was the pork neck. Very tender and a dish that finally had some great flavor to it! This dish may be the only reason we'd come back. It's unfortunate that it came too late after a flurry of just-okay dishes.Overall, my expectations of this place may have been set too high. Nothing was outright terrible, but that's not enough to suggest a revisit anytime in the future."
"A ridiculously sophisticated menu...in a good way! Oysters are great. Baked potato bing bread is a must. Crispy sesame leaves are something you need to experience. For bigger dishes, the hangar steak was as good as it gets. The dolsot bi bim bop (escarole, albacore, lemon, BBQ onion, seaweed and soft egg) makes you feel weird mashing it all together but you're supposed to do it!We are excited about this place and you should go now."
I really like this place both for its vibe and the food. The four of us split 6 dishes and the standouts were the bing bread (honestly the best bing bread I've had -- and this is coming from an Asian) and the boudin noir -- suprisingly delicious and also the mung bean pancake (THAT PORK BELLY my God).I would skip the chicken (really tiny portions...) and the dolsot bibimbop (just get the real thing for less at joongboo). I also really liked the dining space. It can get quite loud but it's a very pretty environment to enjoy your korean fusion food. I would come back again!
"Overall: Great food, great atmosphere, and an overall great time. Just not quite mind blowing.The Good: The food is very interesting and delicious. The atmosphere is fun and cozy but is also cramped. A lot of different and interesting options. Prices are reasonable on food.The Bad: The food wasn't mind blowing. The service, while friendly, was long-waited at times. The alcohol seemed rather expensive. Some of the dishes were misses on taste.Atmosphere: 9/10Service: 7/10Food: 8/10"
"Wow. Everything about this restaurant was perfect. The ambiance, the people and service, the food... I kindaaa wanna go back again next wk before I leave town, is that crazy?! I absolutely love Korean food and when I heard about Parachute I knew I had to try it next time I was in town.  The bing bread omg... It was like eating a buttery pizza potato bread maybe? I don't even know how to explain it, it was phenomenal. Like others have said- you must order this to start!!! The shrimp toast was also really interesting and quite tasty! Definitely recommend the dolsot bi bim bap.... On the night we came, It was served with albacore tuna, which was such a twist! Loved it. Also tried the black udon noodle with squid and pickled chilis-- wow those pickled chilis tho. And the hot pot was a bit on the salty side but was delicious! I would probably recommend ordering that if you're in a group of 4, unless you like leftovers like me ;) unfortunately had no room for dessert but will try next time! Parachute is perfection. No other way to describe it."
"Amazing place and worth the hype.  Bonus is that it might be one of the better date spots in Chicago.We ordered the Bing Bread (a must), Kalbi Jjim and Dolsot Bi Bim Bap.  Each dish was amazing and very different than going to your typical Korean restaurant.  The ingredients used and style in which each were prepared make it a unique dish (even if you have had it a 100 times).Highly recommend this place.  The food is fantastic and the service was just as good.  It makes my top 5 places in Chicago list!"
"Parachute seems destined to receive a spot on multiple national ""best new restaurant"" lists. Rightfully so, as there's a lot of promise to Beverly Kim and Johnny Clark's charming and tasty passion project. There's also room to grow, and anointing five stars to a restaurant that has yet to hit its ceiling seems premature.After overwhelming demand, Parachute switched to a limited reservations policy, which is how I was able to actually snag a date night here (with a kid in hand, casual trendy no res places, as awesome as they can be, are somewhat a challenge). Even with the reservation time and early arrival, we were seated roughly 20 minutes late. Aside from the minor speed bump, service was impeccable. We had a fantastic waiter and amicable hostesses. Parachute is located on a grungy street in Avondale with nothing, and I mean bupkis, around it. I imagine it's how Logan Square looked five years ago. The upside is free, and plentiful, parking. The galley-style restaurant would not be out of place in East Village, with its open kitchen view and stylish decor. Predictably, lighting is dim.The menu is best described as Korean with a twist. The menu, both in composition and taste, reminded me of Chris Shepherd's masterpiece in Houston, Underbelly. Kim and Clark stay faithful to the Chicagoan's love of salt as a spice, but add a heavy dose of Korean influence, both salty and spicy.I started with the ""Number 1"", a mescal-based cocktail, while the wife opted for a housemade lemonade. For small plates, we went with the the market oysters and bing bread. The oysters were a mite small, but tasty and fresh, and the soju granita was refreshingly good. The bing bread, as evidenced on Yelp, is one of Parachute's calling cards. It was the best thing we ate all evening, with a crispy exterior and a soft, plushy interior that melted in our mouths. Asians tend to be big fans of the pork-scallion-bread combination, and this was no exception.Our first main was the other house specialty, a pork belly and mung bean pancake. It's completely bold and in your face. Mung bean tends to be a muted ingredient in Asian cooking, complemented by other goodies. In this case, the kimchi and black garlic sauce combination gave the dish an unbelievable tangy taste that subsided through the bites. That became a common theme in Parachute's dishes: the last bite is better than the first.Once you get over the overwhelming taste palette, your tongue settles down and enjoys the flavor harmony. But there's a hump to get over, particularly if you're not a fan of Asian cooking. Our next dish was the dolsot bi bim bop. I'm a huge tripe fan, and actually found the dish's barbecued tripe to mute the inherent texture of the meat too much. Also, paying $17 for bi bim bap goes against the parsimonious Asian bones in my body. However, I do consider this a great dish to share, and an easy way to get people to try tripe. Plus, charred rice. Absolutely delicious and one of my favorite things on earth.We ended with the hot pot, just a whale of a dish. Upon ordering, our waiter strongly advised we cut one, if not two, dishes from our order. We wisely complied and wished him thanks after. This thing is big enough to feed a small army. Unlike the other dishes, which start salty and mellow out over time, the hot pot starts light but amps up in flavor as the broth settles in. The bone marrow plus crab combination is unfairly tasty. If it weren't for my wife's utter love and devotion to all things hot pot, this beast would be size and cost prohibitive. Give it to a table of six, though...To wrap up, there were bites of each dish that I absolutely loved, and others that made me question the flavor profile thrown together. To the extent that Parachute can iron out the latter without compromising the former would elevate it from good to great. Also, get the bread. Back to the Underbelly analogy: it may hurt to pay for bread, but it's so, so good. Worth every bite."
"This is one of the finest dining experiences I've ever had. They were packed, but the service was attentive and friendly. They killed it in every dish, which borrowed from Korean, Puerto Rican, Indonesian, American, and Chinese influences. It's not quite fusion, but damn it is imaginative!And delicious. The food was so well-executed. The ingredients fresh. It was a total win. Their cocktails were awesome, the beer they have from a local brewery called IBW is a revelation. Go. Eat. Thank me later."
"After a trip to the movies, I noticed that in our hunger we could score 9:30 reservations for Parachute.  This was fantastic since I was looking forward to trying this place for quite some time.  I've been a fan of Beverly since Top Chef and had tried Aria a couple of times before  this.The food was fantastic.  My favorite of which was the fried sesame leaves.  They were so tasty and crisp and they were perfect with the bourbon soy sauce.   You got this great umami flavor along with a tiny bit of a smoky flavor.  It is now one of my favorite appetizers in the city.  As far as drinks go, we ended up trying all the cocktails and I can say with confidence that they should be ranked as such.  #1, 3, 4, 2.  Though each of them are fantastic in their own right.I did enjoy the salad but I just wished that it had a bit more of the togarashi granola.  The dressing was a bit tart and the granola helped to balance things out and make everything pretty perfectly.  That is a small complaint for not a great reason as well.The hand torn noodles were fantastic.  The noodles were incredibly chewy.  The lamb sofrito sticks to the noodles well and it has a great spicy zing from the sichuan peppercorns.  The dish was so tasty that even though it may have been a touch on the spicy side I couldn't stop eating it.  By the time the Bim Bim Bop came out I was already near full but it was fantastic.  The barbecued tripe was awesome and slightly chewy but melted in your mouth.  Additionally I loved the crispness you get from the rice on the sides of the bowl.  The brussel sprouts in there were so tasty that  they were like little balls of napalm on my tongue after coming out in a hot bowl.As far as dessert is concerned it was near perfect with me as it wasn't that sweet.  The rye mochi cake was a fantastic and the buttery elements were balanced with the freshness of thinly sliced raw Asian pear."
"It's a sign of a great restaurant (and modern technology) when only after the 3rd dish of the evening, you end up making reservations to come back.   Yes, its that good!The flavors of most of the dishes were so addictive and unique, that we almost ordered half of them again.  (even though we weren't hungry) Highlights - bing bread (just go ahead and get the full order), pork belly and mung bean pancake, the mandu, hand torn noodles and the bi bim bop!  Medium lights were the cobia (overwhelming grapefruit) and the sesame leaves.The restaurant has a great setup where you most likely end up sitting next to strangers...why is that great, you may ask?  Those strangers come with food and they will share the food with you!  (this is not guaranteed, but encouraged)  This is how we ended up tasting the short ribs - a must order as well!Run, don't walk to this place!  Great service and not outrageous prices make this a well rounded choice any night of the week.  Well, except when they are closed...."
"I suppose I need to go again, but I was actually disappointed with my experience at Parachute. With all the rave reviews out there, I was SO pumped to get a reservation. The Baked Potato bing bread, I will admit, was its saving grace. It was excellent. Had everything been at that level of delicious, I would give this place a 5+. Unfortunately, there were a few things we got that we straight up didn't like; one of which we hardly touched (the torn noodle dish). That basically never happens. My husband and I are probably 2 of the least picky eaters I know. The other items were good, but not amazing. The duck, the pork belly pancake....good but nothing to write home about.Maybe I am just too critical because of my super high expectations coming into this place. I would be willing to go again once they change their menu a little."
"Aware of the no reservation policy and the recent professional review by Phil Vettel who raved about Parachute I was somewhat alarmed when I noticed what appeared to be a nearly half mile long line as I approached. Fortunately this turned out to be for Hot Dougs and arriving just minutes before the 5:00pm opening (blue hair special) there was only a smattering of people already congregated outside the doors. Right on time we were  ushered inside to what turned out to be a fantastic meal; Parachute is definitely one of Chicago's best new venues of 2014.The space itself is nothing spectacular; the open kitchen is nice but the decor itself did not have a lot of character - nothing unpleasant or uncomfortable by any means, but just nondescript. The crowd was quite ecletic with people of all ages, even a family with young children. Despite not being crazy about the physical space itself, everything else about the experience was wonderful. Our server promptly arrived at our table and gave a brief but helpful overview of the menu. Parachute features Korean cuisine with small plates designed to be shared. There are two categories of savories; the top portion consists of bites that arrive quickly to get you started and the bottom portion of more heartier fare, arranged in order of lighter dishes to fattier, heavier cuisine. Ordering three from each category was just about perfect for our party of two.All six savories were hits with three falling into the category of ""must order."" This would include the crispy sesame leaves served with a bourbon infused soy dipping sauce; a little greasy but so delicious they are addictive - proven by the fact that my wife actually ordered another batch as her dessert. It was like an exotic, attractive, gourmet tempura but far superior to any tempura I had previously consumed. From the bottom portion of the menu the Pekin duck breast was fabulous but my favorite dish on the night was the salt and pepper pork ribs with a yuzu glaze; so tender and flavorful it was like a spa day for my taste buds. I am still craving more of that dish. The least successful dishes were the oyster ssam - essentially an oyster lettuce wrap (the flavors just did not seem to work together as well as the other dishes) and the hand torn noodles with spicy lamb (I loved the spicy lamb meat but the noodles were too mushy and some greens sitting atop had so much vinegar that it overwhelmed the dish to an extent). The meal ended on a high note as I loved my yuzu, ginger custard dessert covered in a delicious meringue; great mix of different textures and flavors that elevated one another. In addition to being reasonably priced (definitely a good value for the quality) and mostly well executed, much of the cuisine artistically presented. We definitely left wanting to return sooner rather than later to explore more of the menu (as well as re-experience the crispy sesame leaves and pork ribs). Service was also a strong point. Jane, our primary server, checked in with us with just the right frequency and in addition to being helpful was warm and friendly (as was everybody we encountered). This definitely enhanced the meal. Our server and the kitchen also did a stellar job with pacing. The items on the top portion of the menu came out rapidly but the three from the bottom portion were served one at a time with a small gap between so that we could really take in the flavors of each dish and enjoy a more leisurely dining experience. Also adding to the experience was my really pleasant and well balanced bourbon cocktail with lapsang soushong tea and Boker's bitters. Parachute also has a very reasonably priced wine list with options by the glass, carafe and bottle. Parachute definitely has all the right elements to be a very popular restaurant in Chicago for years to come and is well worth frequenting. I do hope they find a way to accept reservations in the near future; while arriving very early on weeknights is not problematic, on weekends or during prime seating on weeknights Parachute may wind up with rather lengthy waits as word further gets out about just how amazing a dining experience awaits."
"My husband and I had such a pleasurable, memorable dinner at Parachute. Very unique menu, presentation, and decor. (We loved the speaker wall!)  Nothing super ""out there"" in terms of cuisine, but you just won't find many places that feel so creative. While I wouldn't exactly recommend kids, we did bring our 6 month old (Thursday night) and the staff was absolutely lovely with him. A little odd bit of real estate they are inhabiting - can't decide if its a + or -."
"Excellent, excellent establishment.  Every single part of the experience is well thought out, perfectly executed and done with the experience of the diner in mind.  The staff is friendly, attentive and cohesive right down to the Busboy.The room isn't all that large but is well laid out so it doesn't feel claustrophobic.  There is a little waiting area behind the host stand and if it's terribly crowded you can always walk across the street to Chef O'Neils and Parachute will call you when your table is ready.Food was amazing.  I would have been happy ordering pretty much anything on the menu.  While everything was great the real highlights were the Crispy Sesame Leaves, Pork Belly/Mung Bean Pancake, Black Lentil & Striped Bass.  They change their menu so those items may not be there when you go but don't worry I suspect there will be something else worthwhile.Wine menu is limited but pretty diverse.  I like the way they group and price them.  If you are looking for extremely high end options you may be a little disappointed but the food will make up for it.My only critic is the shabby house plants above the speaker wall.  They look terrible.  Should be bright flowers or a more vibrant type of plant.Tables can be somewhat communal depending on where you sit.  So keep that in mind if you are a party of two.I can't wait to go back."
"This was good , nothing spectacular , not bad at all either , just good (and a bit more $ than what I am used to paying for this type of food). I can tell the ingredients are good and understand the extra cost, but at the end of the day I would rather go elsewhere if spending that much. Nothing bad and definitely  worth going , my wife liked it more than I did, just don't go expecting the next best thing and u will be happier."
"Great restaurant! Came in with high expectations and left fully satisfied. Reasonable prices and fairly generous portions as well. Came here on a Wednesday night, restaurant about half full. Glad we avoided the high times when there is an hour or two wait. Could be really loud. There is a large communal table in the middle, some seats along the bar and kitchen, and a few tables. Maybe seats 30-40 people total. Ordered the bing bread($7 for a loaf).. Do not skip this bread. Best bread I've had that I had to pay for at a restaurant! I would love to take a loaf home. Oyster po boy($8): really liked this dish as well, the oyster was battered in corn meal and fried but still juicy inside. It was served on top of leafy greens instead of bread with an Asian sauce. Good dish but small. Two large oysters. Albacore tuna($12): great dish, I was surprised. the fish was sushi grade and really really fresh served with figs and fried seaweed with some kind of powder. Very light and fresh dish. Duck breast: best duck breast I've had I awhile. Although a small entree ($23), I think it was worth it. It was served with peaches and plums, with a grilled lettuce on top. Scrumptious! The duck was juicy and the sauce it came with was dish licking good. I grabbed a spoon and was slurping it away. Bi bim bop: served in a hot stone bowl with crispy trout. The trout was phenomenal, perfectly cooked with a perfect fried skin. We decided to take the trout out before mixing everything as our server suggested. Good dish, very similar bi bim bop you would get at a typical Korean restaurant. There was a perfect poached egg to mix everything with. At the end some of the rice was crispy from cooking in the hot stone. Fun dish but it wasn't a stand out compared to the other ones. Also, best dessert I've had in awhile: teapot cake with blueberries ($8) but Beverly will no longer serve it on her menu :( Bottom line, great new restaurant that I would definitely come back to!"
"The hubby and I are big Top Chef fans, and because of Beverly Kim's connection to Parachute AND all the buzz surrounding this place, we decided to celebrate our anniversary here, and by the halfway point, we were discussing whether it could stay as amazing as the first few dishes were. When all was said and done, there was not a single miss, and we were convinced that it was one of our best meals ever. We have eaten at some great places, but this was definitely one for the record books, especially given the fact that our bill was under $100. Here's the breakdown of what we had:First appetizer: Fried Tapioca with pecorino and furikake. Fried WHAT?!?!? Oh, but it was flavorful, texturally complex, and unique. How can it be so light and sinful at the same time?!?!  This is an absolute must.Second Plate: Baked Potato Bing Bread with bacon, scallion, and sour cream butter. For $7, this is their most raved about, signature dish and I've never had anything like it. The crispy top contrasted beautifully with the pillowy insides, and the flavors were subtle and satisfying. While it was brilliant on its own, we also used it between courses to sop up every sauce and broth, and it worked with every dish. Again, amazing flavors and texture! ANOTHER absolute must!Third Plate: Crispy Sesame Leaves: For $4, getting tempura-fried sesame leaves with bourbon-soy sauce seemed like a no-brainer, and it was incredible! Delicate and responsibly decadent, this was a great snack between heftier plates! While not a top-three, it was the best bang-for-your-buck choice of the night, so get it.Fourth: Pork Belly and Mung Bean Pancake ... wow! On top of the proteins and pancake is basically an Asian frisee salad: kimchi, black garlic, hen egg, and pineapple. Sweet and salty, bright and savory, crispy and gooey. Fantastic! This was the hubby's favorite, so I guess it's also a ""must get.""Fifth: Warm Spinach Gomae, with black sesame and ginger. This was a perfect choice to pair with the hangar steak or to enjoy by itself. Perfectly cooked, wilted but still with a residual crunch, and just enough kick from the ginger to keep your taste buds alive and happy, the hubby felt like it was so flavorful and bright that it could have been dessert. I wouldn't have a meal here without it, especially as a good pairing with a protein.Sixth: Grilled Hangar steak, with ssamjang sauce and lettuces. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the flavors were popping: somewhere close to a bulgogi but with more chili paste and vinegar. Yum! If you like steak, this is a great option.Cocktail #1: Mezcal, hibiscus vermouth, gran classic, and spicy bitters. Think Mexican Old Fashioned. The hibiscus and Mezcal gave this cocktail a more ""natural"" flavoring, and the spicy bitters and gran (a natural Campari) provided the complexity to make it sing on the tongue.  I could see coming back JUST to sip on this perfect cocktail.With our three starters and three larger plates, and one cocktail each, our bill was still double figures!!! And there are plenty of amazing selections we have yet to try. This was just a fantastic dining experience.  Hooray!!"
"I'm absolutely heart broken. I've been looking forward to dining here for months now.  I wanted to love it but I'm sad to report it just wasn't good.Came here on a Saturday evening with some friends.  We were recommended by our waitress to order 4 dishes from the starter menu and 4 to 6 larger dishes for 4 people to share.  Seemed like a lot so we decided to do 2 appetizers and 4 entrees. We first got the Bing Bread which was extremely yummy but that was the most memorable dish of the night.  The flavor profile was not quite right for the rest of the entrees. Everything tasted meek and muddled with too many ingredients that just didn't mesh well.  The most disappointing dish of the night by far was the Hot Pot. The broth was salty and lacked the depth I was expecting. It also had nothing of substance. Some mountain vegetables, greens,few clams  and lots of noodles to fill up the pot. It's good to see a Korean restaurant getting the buzz and the recognition it has but it just wasn't for me sad to say."
"I was super excited to try this place out. It's good, but I wasn't blown away. The potato bing bread was my favorite dish. I would pass on the crispy sesame leaves. It just tasted like straight up tempura batter. Everyone was raving about the pork belly and mung bean pancake so I had to try it. I thought it was okay, nothing spectacular. A lot of flavors going on, for sure. The black udon noodles were fun and the the squid was cooked perfectly and had a nice creamy soft texture. My table enjoyed the char siu pork. A lot of nice textures going on in that dish and the pork was soft and tender. The spicy beef hot pot was good, but there wasn't much beef in it. It also wasn't spicy. The noodles were good, though, and the portion size was large enough to share between 4 people. Nothing on the dessert menu caught our eye, so we passed on that and decided to go somewhere else. Cocktail #3 was delicious. I thought I'd like #1, but I ended up giving it to my bf. It was too syrupy for me.The place is pretty small, but the environment is cool and laid-back. Very comfortable and casual atmosphere."
"Decided to try this place with some friends the other night. First of all, the service was impeccable. We were seated right on time of our reservation, our server was a very educated on the food and sweet, and the team service was spot on.I enjoyed the cocktails very much and the appetizers were delish. The fries sesame leaves were so unique and awesome.The small plates were super tasty. Anything with yuzu has my blessing! The duck breast was also out of this world.For dessert, we shared the chocolate mousse, which was like a super decadent dessert cereal."
"I wanted to love this place, especially after barely getting a table for after 9pm, however, we were very underwhelmed by the food and experience. I understand the concept, and give credit for trying it, however, I feel that the food needs to be improved. We ordered a lot to try a variety of items and I can't say anything was amazing. Sorry, we tried..."
"Dear Parachute,I think we should see other people.  I know that we only met once on Valentine's Day ($65 Pre-fix; 3-course) but there weren't enough sparks (or stars... 3 to be exact) to make me want to return.  Call me a foodless romantic, I guess.  Similar to most terrible romantic comedies, there were some good moments that would bring a little smile like... +Your decent (not great) flavor profile in the blue cheese, STEAK, and brassicas dish...+Your nice cocktails that featured a nice smokey MEZCAL and the other that had a refreshing MAKGOLI and grapefruit mixture...BUT NOT enough for a 2nd date. I know when I am being led on.Here were some of my 50 shades of disappointment:- You are wayyy overpriced.  The 3 dishes you provided (+1 free bite) was not even close to $65... maybe $50? Maybe. (Taking advantage of respectable guys looking to meet a nice dinner... pretty low.)  Don't take this the wrong way, but you just came off as a greedy gold digger.-You have a nice communal-seated bar, but the red lights need to go.  Red-light-district dining ain't my cup of tea.-1st Course: SARDINE and Citrus Salad on top was averagely executed.  Sure the flavors were different, but different is not necessarily good. -2nd Course: STEAK with Asian Blue Cheese Sauce tasted nice.  But the Brassicas were just whole leaves lightly dressed that blanketed the majority of the plate.  Awkward.  Also, the hangar steak was cooked rare which took away from the sauce.  I would have preferred Medium Rare, but nobody asked.-3rd Course: Buttermilk PANNA COTTA had a nice balanced texture with creamy flavor.  But the portion was just too large, and it became tiresome to eat.  I would have rather had less dessert and another Course.  The effort was too little, too late.Finally, my mom doesn't like that you say you are Korean... but you really aren't.  I know that I'm not really that Korean either, but at least I admit it.  Everybody deserves a 2nd chance... and maybe our paths will meet again... But trust me, I won't be looking for it.Uninterested on Elston,D1."
"So much is good here.  Warning, this review is a mish mosh of two visits, so the menu has changed since.- Today's mocktail was a watermelon shiso with soda and lemon. Delicious! I always appreciate a non-alcoholic option.- Fried sesame leaves. So light and crispy and not oily. Delicious.  Keep the bourbon soy sauce for later.- Bing bread is so addicting. It is like a cross between bread and a scallion pancake, and with bacon and potatoes.  So unique, and I loved it!  PRO TIP: Dip bread in previous sauce.- The crudo was the only thing that didn't really make an impression on me.  It was kampachi, with wax beans and an avocado puree.  Pass.- Hot Pot. For $36 this is a steal. The crab broth is so crabby and tastes like it's been simmering forever.  It's a great broth.  Make sure you have at least 4 people because this dish is FILLING. There were at least 8 gulf shrimps and 5 top neck clams.  These are not yo mama's shrimp and clams.  I imagine asians will want rice with this (I don't know if they offer rice or not?).  But the rice cakes in the stew help.For dessert we went with the pat bing soo.  Beverly's take is much more refined of what you'd find at your neighborhood korean snack shop. Tonight's had cherries, lemon verbena, cherry ice cream, ginger.  You have to make sure you get a little bit of everything into your bite, else the ginger and lemon verbena can be really overpowering.My only regret is that I don't have a second stomach to try the hand torn noodles. And the pork ribs. And pretty much the rest of the menu.UPDATE: Came back for the hand torn noodles and they're delicious."
"I really love the small plate menus that restaurants like Parachute and Girl and the Goat have because it lets you try things across the menu without feeling like you're stuck with one entree that you might not like.  That being said I was suprised when I heard that a place like this was opening in Avondale.  I used to live across the street and remember when a few different places occupied this spot including a Panderia.The space inside is super cozy.  There are not a lot of tables so there is going to be a wait unless you get reservations.  Our waiter was super helpful in terms of navigating the menu as well.     Food was on point throughout the meal.  Started with Bing bread, highly recommended.  After that the wife and I just started our menu draft, taking turns picking whatever we though sounded good.  She picked the crispy sesame leaves and I came back with the spicy lamb sofrito.  Then we got the steak and some kind of sunchoke dish.  I really enjoyed this place because all the flavors were different and  unique.  These are not things you're going to find anywhere else in the city.  There is a lot of hype surrounding this place recently and it is definitely justified."
"Parachute was really, really good. We had a truly fabulous dinner here. We made our reservation a few weeks in advance. I had heard it can be tricky to walk in. The restaurant is small, with a few tables along the right side of the restaurant. The bar has a custom concrete top and stretches into the restaurant, serving as a high communal table. The restaurant was pretty and well-decorated, but in future I think I would ask for a non-communal table. The high bar hurt my back and I'm not a huge fan of the communal table thing. Our waitress was adorable, stylish, and helpful. I had a carafe of white wine, my husband had a cocktail which tasted vaguely of gummy bears. We started off with the bing bread which was so effing good. You must try it if you go there. You simply must. The people next to us asked for an order to go (which they don't do, but I understand why they asked!)We also had this amazing octopus dish, a pasta dish that was like a funky dirty delicious lasagna (yes please) and some AMAZING beets. We also had a pork dish recommended by our waitress which was delicious. It's not cheap, but it wasn't outrageous for a Saturday night date dinner. And, it's well worth the price--the food was delicious and memorable. Go check it out! I only wish I hadn't been so tired from a crazy week and could have swung over to small bar (my favorite) after dinner for a drink!"
"Korean food is, in my esteem, a blue collar food. Nothing fancy or pretentious about it, it's meat, rice, and veggies, usually in that order. Chef husband and wife Johnny Clark and Beverly Kim have done the nigh impossible and crafted a Korean American dining experience that is unapologetically unique and exquisitely delicious.When you walk inside, you are met with vintage stereo speakers playing vinyl records and cozy handmade tables and chairs. Venture further in and you'll find the communal counter where you can see the cooks preparing your food. I recommend the counter, as watching the process gives you a greater appreciation of your meal.The staff is friendly and knowledgeable. I discussed the menu with Matty for several minutes before deciding on three possible entrees and leaving the final decision to him.He returned shortly with the monkfish roasted in gochujang with carmelized sunchoke. One bite, and I found myself doing something I never did with Korean food: savoring the experience. The delicate and mild texture of the monkfish was heightened by the gochujang while tempered by the sweetened sunchoke. It was something I'd never quite tasted before, and I took my time enjoying every bite.I look forward to returning to try the rest of the menu. And I might actually bring a dinner date, something I'd NEVER consider in a traditional Korean restaurant.Bravo, Johnny and Beverly. Bravo."
"Came here on a Thursday night in a group of 4.The atmosphere of this place is really cool. Feels like a restaurant in Portland OR. Nice wood tables, clean lay out. Very nice.We had reservations and were seated right away. We got the bing bread and the house pickles for a small app. Both were great. The bing bread is very interesting, and has a very smokey flavor to it, so if you don't like smokey you probably won't like the bing bread too much. The pickles were amazing and the radish zuke was also very good.For our main meal we ordered:Spicy Beef Hot Pot - This was delicious. A little salty, and we probably shouldn't have ordered it when it was 80 degrees outside, but still good. Very healthy portion size too... almost filled up 4 people alone...Bim Bop - A big bowl of rice with goodies inside like an egg, fish, etc. The bowl is very hot so it makes the rice get crispy on the bottom, which is the best part! A little too lemony for my liking.Pork Belly Pancake - My favorite dish we ordered. So good! Pork Belly, hen egg and pineapple! You can't go wrong!For dessert we did the braised pineapple, it was soooo good! One thing I will tell you about this place, SAVE ROOM FOR DESSERT!"
"Went to Parachute last night for my Bday. Overall a great experience. From the initial phone call to try to get a table I was greeted with a very polite and professional person. Our waiter/bartender was very knowledgable and friendly. Helped us navigate the menu. The food was very good especially the pork secreto and the spicy lamb noodles. The secreto was one of the best pork dishes I've ever had. The starters also very good, assortment of Korean style pickles, oysters and crazy good baked potato bread (we had 2 orders). We were disappointed with the broccoli and Lardo dish, the Lardo was just soft and unpleasant. The biggest misses were the desserts. Miso ice cream, love the idea but way too salty. The bittersweet chocolate shortbread dish was too bitter and overall not appealing. We were craving something more simple and clean after such a flavorful and big meal."
"The  grilled pork secreto was one of the best pork dishes I've ever had. The caulifower had a great char without being dry and the potato bing bread was something new that I've had at any other restaurants.Not a place that you would expect to see in this area, especially on Elston. Highly recommend."
"Parachute has a strong following, evidenced by the number of glowing reviews here. So I'm reluctant to say that it's just flat-out bad. Clearly there's a chance you'll like it. But I wouldn't recommend it.The environment (lighting, decor, acoustics) are all great. We sat at a long community table, less than 2 feet from other patrons on either side, and could easily carry on a conversation at normal volume.My guest and I agreed that the food was lackluster across the board. Of the handful of items we ordered, only 1 or 2 would I want to eat again (a few even if they were free). Nothing tasted bad, necessarily, but nothing was particularly good. Just ""blah"" across the board.We were told by a friend just before we went that the best approach was to let our host guide us through the menu. Unfortunately, our hosts idea of a guided tour is to order every other thing on the menu, far more food than is even remotely reasonable for two people.Baked Potato Bind BreadDry. Dense. Fills you up without being particularly tasty. Not a good way to start a huge meal.House PicklesYou can't go wrong with Kimchi, obviously, but this was two bowls of pretty bland pickled veggies + a bowl of kimchi. Confusing.Crispy Sesame LeavesThis one stood out. The leaves were fried with a light breading and had a delicate crispness that paired well with the bourbon barrel soy.Pork Belly and Mung Bean PancakeI absolutely didn't understand this dish. None of the ingredients stood out, and the texture was very peculiar.White AsparagusHonestly, I don't even remember this one well enough to talk about it. That says something.Tuna Bi Bim BopThey bring it out with raw tuna and rice in an extremely hot stone bowl. It might have been decent, but they tell you that you should mix the whole thing up before eating. Terrible idea. The bowl cooks the raw tuna, but isn't hot enough to sear it, so instead of fresh tuna you end up with steamed, undercooked tuna in what is essentially a risotto.Braised Pineapple with Ice CreamThis was good. It's pineapple and ice cream. A nice touch was the flakes of crispy dried pineapple which reminded me of pineapple-flavored frosted flakes.If you've eaten everywhere else in Chicago and you're curious, give Parachute a try. Otherwise, there are far better places to go first."
"There are some incredibly well written (and accurate) reviews of Parachute so I'll keep this brief... - Atmosphere is funky, retro and rustic. It's a bit loud, but conversation was still manageable for our group of 4. The upside is that we're sort of loud ourselves, so we didn't stick out :)- We had someone with us who is not a hugely adventurous eater, but she trusted us and LOVED the meal. BiBimBop - the rice is so crispy, flavorful and perfect. Black ink pasta.- The pork neck was the dish that I liked the least. It just wasn't my thing.- Deserts were good too.- Service started strong, but our server went MIA towards the end of the evening, eventually reappearing just as we were about to send out a search party. I imagine something random happened, so I won't hold it against them.- The downside... the food was so salty that by the time we left my feet were exploding from my ballet flats from swelling/water retention. It felt like I'd walked a million miles, when I had been sitting on a bar stool for 2 hours. Myy normally thin feet had fat little sausages where my toes used to be! I didn't notice the food tasting especially salty, but similar to Girl and the Goat I did drink a TON of water during the meal. The takeaway, this might not be the best place for you if you have medical problems that lead to you retaining fluids or you need to avoid sodium."
"Parachute is amazing! good food and great service! My boyfriend and I were there for the second time last night. we had some oysters ( so fresh! ), hawaiian kampachi, pork belly pancake ( this dish is phenomenal! Its going to be one of my favorite and I recommend that ) Service is awesome! we got the same server as we went last time in summer. she said we both look familiar even that was our second time and the first was like 6 months ago. Its very impressive that she still remember us. we will come back for Hot pot next time and please keep that on the menu!"
"Finally made it and I really wanted to love it but I was disappointed. Let's start by pointing the good things first! The service was great, the place is cozy and has a great vibe. I enjoyed the music although the sound system needs some fixing.My husband and I started with 3 snacks. Sesame leaves were ok but a bit bland, the carrots were pretty good and the croquettes I did not like at all. For the next course we had the pork belly pancakes which were not impressive and the cauliflower. Our last course was chicken and meat which I don't even remember the name.To summarize I think the food is ok but it's not worth the price. There are so many great places in Chicago and to me Parachute does not justify coming back to any time soon."
"I adore Parachute. It's my go to for delicious Korean-inspired eats with a gourmet twist. My friend and I went on a quiet summer evening without a reservation. Because my friend came a bit late, they handed me a drink menu and led me to their quaint little waiting area. We still landed some great seats by the bar immediately upon my friend's arrival.I would definitely take recommendations from the staff and get at least 3-4 items to share. The dishes are rich but also slightly small for me. However, the dessert is totally worth it. Bing Su with fresh blackberries and ginger syrup...just fantastic.It's a totally date-worthy, chill location with phenomenal staff who take food seriously."
"Came here on a Tuesday night. Party of two. Busy night, but was seated at the bar right away.What we ordered:- BAKED POTATO BING BREAD: Yasssss. Bread is hot and flaky dense moist. The tartness from the sour cream butter goes so well with the scallion flavors of the bread. This item is a must at Parachute.- POTATO AND SALT COD CROQUETTES: This was surprisingly not too salty. Just the right amount of saltiness. The spicy plum sauce is unique.- ROMAINE SALAD: It doesn't say on the menu, but this salad is covered in shaved parmesan. The wild rice is crispy and has a nice burnt rice flavor. Full romaine leaves. Reminds me of the bean sprouts and lime plate that comes with a bowl of pho. lol.- PORK BELLY AND MUNG BEAN PANCAKE: The sauces that accompanied this dish definitely made the dish. Tasted like kimchi in sauce form. Everything went well together. No complaints.- SPICY BEEF MARROW AND CRAB BROTH HOT POT: We are big eaters and this was huge. Came with a healthy amount of seafood. The broth is less seafoody than I thought, but the ingredients are flavorful. The tofu was super silky. The mussels were cooked perfectly and the shrimps were my favorite part. Comes with one bowl of rice. This can probably feed 4 people. - BAKED APPLE, BURNT MISO ICE CREAM: This is another must get. The miso in the ice cream is amazing. It's another not-what-you-expect dish. The slight hint of saltiness brings out all the sweetness of everything else in this dessert. The crispy apple chips, warm apple at the bottom, pine nuts, and sage all tasted good on its own and together in a single bite. - Housemade assam milk tea: Hands down best chai thea I have had. Great back heat of spices.- #3 PAYET PISCO TORONTEL, YUJACHA, YUZU BITTERS, EGG WHITE: Amazing cocktail with slight plumy flavors. Service:Everyone was super nice and dishes came out at a perfect pace. They are all knowledgeable about the dishes and are more than willing to explain each item. Overall great experience. This is a 4.5 star."
"A big problem for this restaurant is that it's listed here on Yelp as a ""Korean restaurant.""  It's as Korean as  McDonald's is a German restaurant.  Yes, hamburger is descended from German immigrant cuisine, but both Parachute and McDonald's are American restaurants.  Like all American cuisine, except Navajo and Ojibwe cooking, there are influences from immigrants.  The food here is brilliant original American dishes created by the genius chef, a woman who happens to come originally from South Korea.      Her background is important to understand the name of the place and the decor, in Korean, apparently, there's a mildly derogatory word for someone who looks Korean like her, but is really a foreigner (being so American in her case), it's not like she's really Korean, but more like she just dropped in.  It's a simile.  Or rather a metaphor.  I'll look that up later, I always got them mixed up.  Okay, so as a sociologist, and the son of immigrants from Asia who got similar treatment visiting relatives back in the Orient, I love the name, whether or not I got the story completely correct or not.  So the food is wonderfully unique, the name is intriguing, what's not to like about this place? A number of things, all related to the population density.    This place is like a lot of new, trendy Chicago restaurants in the intermediate price range, it's what young thin people call ""cozy,"" it's what middle aged fat guys like me call cramped and claustrophobia inducing.  It is not comfortable, and the place is justifiably busy and packed because the food is delicious.  So, there's a long wait, even though the hostess is honest about wait times, there's no room at the bar here, and to cut down on people hanging around drinking, they have expensive drinks with up-charges (not hidden, but printed in tiny little letters on the menu so you would only notice if you read Yelp reviews, thank you fellow Yelpers).  It's so noisy, because it's so crowded, if you go with people who are interesting to talk to, you'll be hoarse by the end of dinner, and soon hard of hearing if you're a regular.  Because of the limited seating and popularity of the place, the service, while not rude, it is pressured and quick.  The waitress doesn't have time to wait for you to stop talking, she has to come in interrupting, and the food is timed to come one after another, if you're not quick, you'll lose a course as those dishes need to be in motion at all times.  At this price range, it was the quickest dinner I've ever had, we ate at the speed I used to eat when I was a paramedic.      In spite of the negatives, this place has some really interesting tastes, so here's how you work it.  Go on off nights, before the crowd, early.  Before you go, or while waiting for your table, walk down the block to Chief O'Neill's pub where there not only isn't any nefarious rocks/no rocks up charge, your first drink is usually a generous pour, especially if you order a good Irish whiskey. Back at parachute, get at least one less appetizer than people (if there are four of you, get at least 3 appetizers), and then at least one more entree than people (if there are four of you, get five entrees).  The reason is that the portion sizes are small, but all are unique complex tastes, so eat like at a tapas place.  They then serve dishes in succession with virtually no lag time between, their timing is pressured but remarkably efficient.  It's going to be fast, so one bottle of wine is all you need, pair up with just one of the dishes, there's no way to pair for all the variety.  Don't go with interesting people, it's too loud for good conversation, go with relatives, people you're comfortable ignoring with ear protection in, or boring people you wouldn't be listening to anyway.  Just nod once in a while and concentrate on enjoying the food.  And don't go in expecting Korean food, even if some of the entree names evoke some Korean dishes, this is not a Korean restaurant.  If you want Korean go to Lawrence, Bryn Mawr, the Korean neighborhood."
"Being a top chef fan, I was excited to check out Beverly's restaurant and was pleasantly surprised to have her serve us some of our dishes. -Get there early. They don't take reservations but will text to let you know when your table is ready. We came a little after opening and had to wait about 20 minutes. We were seated at the communal table. -Stand out dishes: boudin noir (loved the texture and flavors, very unique dish), hand torn noodles, salmon (it was cooked perfectly and tasted buttery but light at the same time), butternut squash starter. I would probably skip the apple dessert we had, it was okay but didn't stand out as much as the dinner dishes. -Service was friendly and attentive. The waitress was extremely patient and explained the different dishes. I agree with some other reviewers that this should not be classified under Korean. Its definitely a asian fusion spot but who cares about what it's ""classified"" under, we had a memorable and tasty meal here."
"There were some hits, there were quite a number of misses and though it's okay, I wouldn't trust this Parachute to deploy jumping out of a plane. My friend and I went right at 5 on Saturday when they open as Parachute is on all the hot Eater lists and it's all the buzz around town. We were the first table in there and the cozy restaurant didn't fill up until about 6:30. I loved the interior of the restaurant finding it very welcoming.The staff was friendly and attentive, a bit too much so actually. Every single time I sipped water, my glass was refilled. I appreciated the attention but we had a huge bottle of water for refills right on our table and I felt pressured to top off my glass each time I took a sip to avoid this constant interaction. So my friend and I did just that at the end of our meal as it was deterring from our conversation a bit having the staff at our table constantly. This included our friendly but robotic server who asked us every 5-10 minutes how everything was, including a couple of times when our table was completely clear of anything.In addition to being at our table so much, the staff moved a bit slow. The staff moved in this strange mechanical pace when placing things on or clearing things off our table. When dishes were brought out, it was a long process to try to maneuver them into space on our table. The two tops and just generally small quarters is not at all conducive to the Korean-American Tapas style dishes.Our server suggested we ordered some small dishes plus 4 large plates for 2 people. Thank goodness we didn't listen because that would have been way too much food. We ordered 4 small plates and 2 large plates but even that was too much for the two of us. That brings me to the food. What was good was so good, I'm actually craving it today.Baked Potato Bing Bread $7 for a whole or $4 for half - Get the full order! This delicious bread is served warm with bacon & scallions in it and a side of sour cream butter. This is quite filling since it's carbs but wowza! I absolutely loved this ...even better than the usual bread I get from Korean bakeries.Crispy Sesame Leaves $4 - These were to die for. Deep fry anything and it's going to be fabulous. Such is the case for these addictive little greens. They come with a soy sauce that is a perfect pairing for dipping. This is a must get!Potato & Salt Cod Croquettes $6 - Fishy! If you don't like fish, you won't like this because it's like a fish and potato fish stick. I liked it and found the outside perfect but it definitely won't be for everyone.Then....the not so good...My friend insisted on getting the Pork Belly & Mung Bean Pancake $10 which has kimchi (made with shrimp *shellfish allergy alert*, thank goodness our waitress told us as it's not listed on the menu), black garlic, hen egg, pineapple. Though my friend said we had to get this, she had one bite and wouldn't touch it again. She didn't like anything about it. I thought it was okay though it's not something I would ever get again.Braised Pig Ears Ssam $6 - Zero flavor...strange texture...just wasn't into this at all. If I paired it with the lettuce, all I could taste was leaf and no meat flavor at all. Summer Squash & Shitake Mandu with almonds $18 - Not anything like what I know mandu to be and not something I'd get again. Comes in two big deep fried hashbrown looking pieces. I didn't really get the amazing flavor I thought I would from two veggies I love to pieces. It was fine just nothing I can say I loved.Pacing is bad on dishes coming out. At least it was for my friend and I. Every single dish came out at the same time except for the mandoo. Our server apologized and said they'd slow our meal down, but at that time we only had the one dish left. They apparently not only slowed down our meal but completely stopped it. We ended up being at the restaurant for 2 hours because after we finished every other dish & our table was cleared, we still waited an additional 30 minutes for our final dish. That was very surprising and quite disappointing. I was honestly surprised they didn't do anything to make amends on that piece like offering to cancel that dish, especially when my friend politely asked what the deal was. We ordered all our dishes at the same time as our server requested so I'm not sure what happened behind the scenes.I wouldn't call this Asian fusion or Korean fusion food but more American style using Korean ingredients in each dish. I suppose that is fusion to some degree but it really loses any resemblance of any Korean food I've ever had growing up. That's not a negative by any means though. I'd go back to Parachute again as I think service issues may just take some time to work out and the kitchen absolutely needs to work on timing. I loved the bread and would like to try other things on the menu because I feel like there are some gems in there. Plus they have a totally cute guy behind the bar."
"Loved this place.  We shared 5 dishes, and found 4 to be outstanding, one just OK.  The best was probably our entree, the char siu pork.  OMG, so tender, and the sauce and veggies with it were perfect.  You must get this entree.  For a quick starter we had the gado gado.  I'm not even a big raw veggie eater, but with this sauce I think I would eat my hand.  Delish.  The spinach gomae was also awesome - we order gomae at sushi places all the time, and this was a fun and different take on that.  The only dish I found to be just so-so was the dukbokki.  Not that it was bad, it was just a TON of rice dumplings with not much meat or mushrooms.  Filling, but maybe not in a good way.  Other than that great experience.  Be warned, if you are a group of two you will have to share a table or belly up to the bar.  Might be more fun with 4 people so you can have a table to yourself...and order more food!"
"I've heard so many good things about Parachute and had this place bookmarked before it even opened. Boy and I came over the weekend to try it out since he loves Korean food. We were quoted an hour and a half when we arrived a little after 6 but it turned out to be 40ish minutes. We tried the raw oysters (delicious as always), potato and salt cod croquettes (great appetizer, loved the dipping sauce), pork belly pancake (I prefer the croquettes. The black sauce was delicious as well), bimbimbap (could use some color, tasted dry, had to use the black sauce from the pork belly pancake as seasoning) and seafood hot pot (good broth, not spicy whatsoever, lots of seafood, way too much fennel). The place was packed. Loved that there was a row of coat hooks on the wall with bench seating. I wasn't impressed with the service. Hostess was great. A different waitress noticed we had been sitting there for a while, explained the menu and eventually took our order. The lady who was supposed to be our waitress eventually showed up when we asked for the check and our food to go. I hope our tip went to the original waitress.All in all, we had a good time. Come early! I overhead a group saying they were quoted 4 hours. Oy vey."
The bread is the best! Blood sausage! Fried tapioca! Pork! Desserts and cocktails were all great.
"Move out of the way Girl and the Goat, because Parachute is the hip new food gem in Chicago. So, they don't take reservations, but I feel like its for the best... when places like this take reservations it is very hard to game in. Here, you walk in, put your name on the list, you can leave and go get a drink elsewhere or they have a small waiting area... then they text you about 10 min before your table is ready. We came around 7:15pm on a Saturday night and did wait about an hour for a table... but not to worry we went and grabbed a beer at a bar across the street! So now for the food: AMAZING! Well their menu changes quite frequently with a few items that are consistent. We took all the recommendations given to us by our waitress, who was very knowledgable and helpful. The bing bread (obviously) was a huge hit, we did the 3 pickle appetizer, and then the melted beans with veal, the lamb dish, the duck breast, and ended with a black forest cake for desert. LOVED everything, nothing was bland, everything had the right amount of kick, the right amount of everything. And don't forget the drinks... I had the evening special which was the Korean Rice Wine with the pineapple mango pure and mint, and my friend had what looked like a martini but it was very seasonal with egg white fluff on top (very interesting but very good). The service - 5 Stars... no wait... 10 stars! The waitstaff all worked together as a team, my water glass was never empty. They were knowledgable, had great recommendations, brought out the food in a timely manner. Checked up on you ""just enough"" and not too much where you can't carry your conversation... but just the perfect amt. AND BEVERLY KIM HERSELF WAS THERE! If you don't know who that is, google her. She is the Chef/owner of this place... I was so star struck when she came by and asked how things were and even cleared our plates. Then she recommended some dessert.... I was starring. Then I asked her if she was really she... and she was! She was even cool with taking a picture with me! Ahhhhh totally made my night! Anyways, GO TRY THIS PLACE! You will not be sorry!"
"Dat. Bing. Bread. Tho. I've been to Parachute twice within one month - it's that good. The bing bread is an absolute must. I've never tasted anything like that in my life. It was like bringing together my grandma's dinner table and lumping it with western flavors and textures. And the butter. I've been left speechless. Drinks are on point, and so is the music. Your coolness factor increases a few notches by just walking into the restaurant. I would recommend going with a friend that likes to be adventurous as you are splitting as many dishes as possible. Take risks here, because the chef certainly does - it'd be a shame to not reciprocate."
"If I could give 6 stars I would. I am number #37 to review this spot and there is no question within 6 months to a year from now they'll be closer to 370+ reviews and I suspect most of them will be good, because Parachute IS good.This super contemporary, dimly lit, long and narrow restaurant only seats a small amount of people. We lucked out on a thursday evening and were able to grab a seat no problem. You can imagine when the word really gets out, this spot is going to be nuts.While scanning the menu, we were offered some SUPER helpful suggestions of what to check out. I have to say, I was overwhelmed with the options because my options did not fall in line with the typical Korean dishes I'm familiar with. I'm a big fan of Korean food in general and Parachute's menu made me question my understanding of the cuisine (in a good way!)The kitchen decides how to pace the order of your meal based on what you've ordered and our meal started out with the shrimp toast. Wow what a doozy! It had an almost briney like salty brightness. The dark green veggies mixed in brought a perfect balance. If you can imagine what a sound wave looks like, vibrating up and down... that's what it felt like in my mouthNext up was the potato bing bread. It had a great balance of bacon & scallion inside and the sour cream butter was decadent and rich. This dish was giving off some serious comfort food vibes.Our first entree arrived next, and it really threw me for a loop. It was like nothing I've ever had, yet oddly reminded me of greek or lebanese food in texture. Almost like a giant spinach pie, the ""summer squash and shitake mandu with lebneh & almonds"" was a huge dumpling. It had a spicy chili note balanced with yogurt, almonds and thinly sliced squash. The textures on this one were beautiful.At this point, already pretty much full and 100% satiated we were presented with perfectly cooked and aggressively salt & peppered pork ribs. Delicious, and the hot wet towels provided were much appreciated. These were a mess, and a surprisingly flavorful way to end the meal. Who needs dessert when you have pork covered in yuzu kosho, honey & shiso? Yum.From the friendly and helpful staff, to the quick and perfectly paced service, everything ran like clockwork. Definitely worth the trip to Avondale."
"I walked into Parachute with high expectations and felt like they delivered on everything I wanted. The food at Parachute was fantastic. Not fantastic in a way that would lead me to tell all my friends to head to Parachute right away. Fantastic in a way that if you're a fan of cooking you appreciate what they're doing with flavors, textures, and combinations. A fried tapioca with pecorino cheese. A green curry sauce that makes you want to lick the bowl. The cuts on each vegetable executed with precision and intention. Parachute is one of those places that is hard to put into a box because it has many influences but pulls things off in its own way. Despite a small menu, I hear it rotates frequently enough to reward those making a return visit. The trout we ordered apparently had just been added. Each dish I felt was better than the one that came before but I think I would have thought the same thing even if the meal was served in reverse. Each dish was just so unique that the flavors in front of me seemed like the best thing I could have."
"I had heard rave reviews about Parachute from my foodie friends, so I had to try it out. Reservations open a month in advance so I made the reservation as soon as the window opened. We came on a Saturday night at 6 and it was already very busy. The menu was a bit limited but the dishes were creative and very flavorful. Somehow it was more flavorful or ""umami"" than regular Korean food. The space itself was a bit cramped--I would have preferred more space between tables. Overall I enjoyed it and would come back."
"This is a very special place. The atmosphere was quaint and charming and the food was unique and buzz worthy. The bing bread was probably was awesome- would definitely get them again. The sesame leaves were so-so, next time I think I'll get the boudin noir instead. The pork belly pancake was ok (definitely a bit different and should be tried at least once). The bim bop was very good. Would love to come back for the hot pot and pork secreto. We had a traditional ice cream dish for dessert with all sorts of textures in it that was phenomenal as well. The textures and flavors of all her dishes blend so nice together, nothing is really overpowered. Am certainly a returning customer. So happy to have this gem on the north side. She charges far less than she should. Excellent dining experience"
"This place is almost so cool that it lacks a soul. Everything is meticulously thought out and crafted. From the mint condition vintage speakers that line the wall, to the dishes, to the cubes in the drinks, nothing goes unnoticed.We shared the spicy beef hot pot. Very tasty and fun to eat. Although for being the titular ingredient, the beef was conspicuously underrepresented in the dish.The entire experience is totally unique when compared to a typical night out for food and drinks in Chicago. However the lack of any imperfections whatsoever makes it tough to feel comfortable there. Also, it's hard to communicate with the people you dine with due to the overall noise level and the width of the communal seating table top. Could make for an awkward date night.With that being said, this neighborhood deserves more open business. Especially if the service is as good as it is at parachute. The Chicago neighborhood eateries answer to Williamsburg."
"3.5 for the food, bumped up to 4 because the service and cocktails were very good.  The menu changes all the time, so the specific dishes we had and liked might never be there again, but if it's on the menu, you have to order the fried tapioca (with pecorino, seaweed).  This was the star of the 7 dishes we ordered, and reminded us a lot of Brazilian pão de queijo, where instead of using tapioca flour they used pearl tapioca.  And even though ""fried"" is in the name of the dish, it did not feel heavy at all.Which brings me to the crispy sesame leaves.  Unlike so many of the other reviewers here, we found these kind of boring, mostly tasting like ""fried.""All of the other dishes we had (gado gado crudité, roasted eggplant mandu, Hawaiian kampachi with hibiscus, Brussels sprouts, panna cotta with popcorn), were good but not as good as I was hoping for.  The fried tapioca is the only dish where I really savored every bite.  I kept wishing that every dish would be just a little more exciting, especially since they are pricy small plates.But the cocktails (mezcal-based ""cocktail #1"" and whiskey-based ""cocktail #2"") were perfectly composed, and the service was very helpful and attentive: for example, the menu doesn't identify all meat components in a dish and our server happily walked us through what we could eat (we are pescetarians), and after we ordered the panna cotta, someone came from the kitchen to make sure we knew there is gelatin in the dish."
"2.5 stars, maybe 3?  I waited two days to write this review, unsure of what my star rating would be.  I talked to a friend just after our meal, and she asked if I recco'd it.  I could not give her an answer.  What do you do when you only like half of the dishes, but the half you liked were fantastic?  I'll start with the positives as I don't want to be too difficult here.  The potato bread: Delicious.  I could eat this every day for a month and not get tired of it.The Berkshire pork: Also extremely delicious, and cooked perfectly.  Visually a great meal as well.  They hit a little spice, sour, perfect salt, savory.  A++Oysters: nothing bad here about the oysters, but an odd choice of texture.  They freeze the malt vinegar into ice chips.  I put some on my oyster, and ate it.  It gives you the feeling that you have shell bits in the oyster for a second, which for me was unpleasant.  As somebody who eats oysters often, if there is anything crunchy in my oyster, my brain says ""don't eat"".  I had a moment of my brain fighting itself ""the crunchy bits will hurt you...no they won't its just ice"".  My brain does this when I drink Malort as well.  For the record, the oysters were fresh and yummy.  Must let ice bits melt before eating in future, impossible, oysters too yummy.Pork belly and mung bean pancake: outstanding, different, original.  Good work.  Didn't find any pork belly unless it was in the pancake?The apple yogurt salad was a 4/5.  The decor was obviously done on a budget, but was cool enough to work well.  I don't blame them at all for using plywood and cushions formed from moving blankets.  That's a smart decision when opening a restaurant in my opinion that isn't shooting for a flashy feel to not overspend.  I rather liked the old speaker shelf and the lighting as well.  I didn't use the bathrooms, so cannot comment there.  Yes, I did notice the parachute curtains.  Our server was polite and was able to patiently answer the 50 questions that the ladies had next to us had, who seemingly have never eaten food outside of a cheeseburger in their lives.  YES, they just had to be the couple that pulled out their cell phones and used them as flashlights several times during the meal.  ""What wine should I pair with this salad"" ugh.Cue up the hate mail, here it comes...the things we didn't like:The torn noodle dish: It's made with lamb.  I know this because the menu told me so.  If you had asked me what it was without me reading about it I would have had no idea. Very dry, no meat fat whatsoever.  Lots of dried chillies were added to the top of this dish further sucking any moisture out of the noodles and meat.  We took two bites and took it home, and it is still in the fridge.  Overpowered in toasted cumin/chili flavor as well, and yes I can handle spicy.  Noodles had a good texture.  Maybe this was a bad cooking day for this dish, or too much seasoning?  Was like eating a bowl of cereal with a tablespoon of milk.Mandu.  2.5/5 The texture and shape of these dumplings were perfect.  Obviously done by a skilled dumpling maker.  The taste was just OK, and nothing worth noting.  Bland I might say.  I ate most of this dish and my wife passed after one bite.  This might just not have been a dish for us, so I don't want to beat them up over this one too badly.Baked apple dessert with burnt miso:  It definitely tasted like something was burnt and made into ice cream, but not in a good way.  Heavily salted to the point that we couldn't finish it if we had liked the flavor.  I took three bites hoping I would somehow like it, trying to convince myself that there was something wrong with me.  That was a mistake.  This was the last thing we ate and the flavor sat in my mouth for the entire car ride home.  Ick.  Here's the ingredients in order of flavor: Salt, burnt stuff, pine nuts, apple shavings.  As it appears on menu: baked apple, burnt miso ice cream, pine nuts, sage. Overall I felt like I had made a poor choice for my wife's birthday dinner.   Meanwhile the ladies next to us had managed to order bread and one other dish by the time we were done with our meal.  They might still be there for all I know...."
"I am going to wear out your credulity if I keep telling you that I went to another restaurant in Chicago that was simply fantastic, where all of the dishes were interesting and delicious and there's no point telling you about them because you should just go and order and everything that looks good.  (By my count Parachute is the third such place I've been in the past ten days.)  But this is one of them.Oysters, pickles (so *this* is what you are supposed to do with scapes!), bing bread, ceviche, pancake, buckwheat noodles, shrimp toast, tea cake.  If I had to pick a favorite thing, it would be the shrimp toast, rich with umami flavor and covered with intense dark green vegetables, and if I had to pick a least favorite thing it would be the ceviche, a little boring and incohesive.  But seriously, I've never had this kind of Korean fusion food before, and it is just brilliant.  Come, and put yourself in Bev's hands.We walked in at 7:10 pm on a Thursday and the restaurant was only 85% full and we were seated immediately.  This makes us nervous that Parachute is not getting the business it deserves.  It should be full with lines out the door.  I may have to come back every week just to do my part . . . .UPDATED a year later to add:  The good news is that Parachute is now full all the time, and they take reservations now too.  I am no longer worried that this place is going anywhere.  The bad news is that they are so packed that I can no longer get a walk-in table here in less than 90 minutes, even on a weeknight.  And while I'm happy to share the joy, I won't be able to go nearly as often."
"Been meaning to come and check it out.  Finally went with a friend and we ended up getting a few things on the menu.  Small plate, sharing type of dinner.  With a bottle of wine and two and a half hours of continuous eating we were satisfied!  Must try the Bing Bread as well as the Peking Duck dish.  Oh so good.  The oysters were solid as well as the Veal Tartar.  Bibimbop was ok, with raw tuna that ends up being cooked in the stone bowl!  Had their salad which I was ok with but probably would have gotten something else.Service there was excellent!  They made you feel at home and catered to our needs.  Food was coming out faster than we can eat, so we asked if they could slow down our service and they accommodated instantly!  Made for an excellent meal and gave us time to talk and catch up without feeling rushed.Price was a bit high, but I'd definitely come back to try some other dishes, especially their desserts."
"My sister brought me here on a 'sister date' for my 26th birthday.  It' s a small restaurant denoted by 'P' outside and with both 'regular' and communal tables inside.  We we seated between two groups at the communal table (one group of four that kept peering at what we were eating, and one chatty couple who launched into conversation with us right when we sat down).  I'm okay with communal tables at restaurant (hello opportunity to make new dining friends!), but my sister is kind of shy and also really quiet, so I think it was a bit of an adjustment for her.  It didn't help that as the night progressed, the restaurant got busier and thus the volume amped up considerably.The waiters all work together it seems like and are very friendly and helpful (without being intrusive).  I could see into the open kitchen from where I was sitting, which was pretty neat.  The only issue I had was that I frequently bumped into servers/patrons who were passing behind me because the space in the restaurant was a bit tight, but that is probably due mostly to the fact that I tend to flail my arms in excitement when presented with new and tasty foods.We ordered:1. 1/2 order of bacon bread2. steak tartare3. pork belly pancake4. whitefish in lemon sauce with potatoes and radishes5. panna cotta with strawberries, basil, and balsamic glazeAs others have stated, you MUST try the bacon bread. It is DELICIOUS. Like crispy and bacon-y and happy all rolled together in one bundle delivered directly from Zeus's arms to your mouth.  At least this is how I imagine it.  I only regret we only ordered a half order and not the full. I could eat that bacon bread all damn day.The steak tartare was good - have some pickled radish and capers.  I really liked the thin slices of horseradish mixed in, made for some nice spice.  The whitefish in lemon sauce was also very tasty - although served almost at room temperature, which I wasn't quite expecting.  The flavors all worked together really well though.  The pork belly pancake, that tasty bugger put a smile on my face as our waitress set it in front of us.  Porky with some hints of zest from pickled pineapple and a bit of bitter from some mustard greens, it was a perfect plate.  The panna cotta was also delectable, a light ending with some complex flavors (I believe there was some fennel seeds mixed in to balance the sweetness of the strawberries and the savory balsamic glaze and basil additions).All in all I would definitely recommend coming to parachute for dinner - it was a delectable and well executed meal.  Will be coming back to try other items on the menu (and eat more of that bacon bread.. preferably by the boatload)."
!!! So good.  Everything.  I will go back every time I'm in Chicago.  Make sure to get the pickles and bing bread.
Not as good as we expect. Very noisy. The food serves very slow as well. Not worth the money
"This is my favorite restaurant in Chicago for so many reasons! First off, the space is lively and inviting. While parachute is unassuming from the outside, it has a very cozy and sleek feel to it. This is because the restaurant only seats 40 which ties into another reason I love it: the staff! Everyone is so attentive and convivial, and eager to help first timers navigate the menu. The food is out of this world, every dish is bursting with flavor, and there's a real intricacy to how everything is put together and presented without being overly pretentious. I would recommend the black udon (so unique) and the pickles - although really everything is killer.I also have to rave about the vibe: parachutes aesthetic is amazing!!! Almost all the seating is countertop, and the place is really nicely decorated. Special shoutout to the glassware. The people that come to this restaurant are generally cool as well, although it seems like you really need a reservation to get in. The first time I went the place was overwhelmingly loud and crowded; as a result we were brought everything really quickly as an attempt to turnover tables. My second time there was much more pleasant and I really got to enjoy everything. Id recommend going later and trying as much as you can because it's all so awesome."
"Other have covered the appetizers and entrees quite well (which were all interesting and delicious), but the real surprise was the selection of unique and delicious desserts; we had the cornbread and blueberries, and the condensed milk ice cream with all other sorts of things, and both were just so good. Normally I wouldn't think a Korean fusion place would be a dessert stop, but I'm dead wrong. Save some room after your meal!"
"Got a call in the afternoon: Party needs to be complete to be seated and only 15 minute grace period before the table goes to someone else. Pretty standard, I would say, but... Don't have all these expectations for me and then - being on time and complete as always - you let me wait for 32 minutes until we get seated. Right there the mood was down. We got a free dish for that but it was only mediocre and a way too small dish for four people. Appreciated though, nice gesture! Overall, the chicken was the best, other stuff was ok, the bill included an item we never received because they ran out of it -- out of the party of four, probably no one of us will be coming back soon.Service was good and nice, but it was very loud and everything seemed very rushed -- not a cozy dinner and not necessarily worth the trip if you don't live close by. But go and check it out yourself!"
"Come and check it out!Had an excellent meal here tonight.  Fantastic service and comfortable decor.  Cocktails were all well balanced and tasty, along with a great wine selection.  The food was amazing.  Different tastes uncommon in other restaurants in Chicago.  A modern interpretation on Asian cuisine much like Mott St. or Fat Rice, but I like this place better.  It is humbling and I highly recommend.  Everything from the bread to the hot pot, and dessert were fantastic.  I'll definitely be back!"
"I tried Parachute out after months of wanting to go, and I was totally disappointed.  None of the food was worth mentioning, and after splitting the bill and tipping, I had ended up spending $70, and this is without alcohol.  I came expecting Korean fusion food, and it definitely was basically American food.  One of my dishes had rice cake, but that was as Korean as my meal got.  And don't get me started about how terrible the pineapple dessert was."
"Honestly, I was super unimpressed when I decided to check this place out in lieu of Beverly Kim and her success on top chef. Got two of their main cocktails that were recommended. Eh... I could whip up better cocktails at home. Had a plethora of dishes come out, I can't even remember what was served... Yeah none of them were impressionable to me. I often found that some parts of a dish were delicious, but the composite as a whole did nothing for me. Had some  meringue desert... It was so gross that my boyfriend and I almost immediately got nauseous after taking two bites, left with a bitter taste in our mouth. I'm giving this place two stars because the staff was awesome, food came out quickly, and watching the chefs do their thing (sat close to the kitchen as we were seated by the bar) was pretty awesome."
"I really wanted to love Parachute, but it was not meant to be. The good: fun atmosphere, really nice staff/hosts, and the bing bead was super tasty. The bad: both mine & my date's dinners were way over salted to the point where he only ate the fish out of his bi bim bap (leaving 3/4 of the dish uneaten). For a more expensive menu, I wanted to eat and love everything on our plates, but I only liked the appetizers."
"Start with the crispy sesame leaves (with a fab bourbon barrel soy dipping sauce). Divine! Also, go for the bing bread, which is a potato bread with little chunks of bacon and scallion cut through, served with a smear of sour cream butter. That butter is addictive, just saying.The menu shows enormous imagination--complex flavors that come together for one amazing dish after another. Black lentil mandu is sooo good, and the butcher's steak is a must.We finished a beautiful evening with the mascarpone panna cotta (it's topped with umeboshi granitee and a fine chop of lemon balm). Outstanding. What a night!"
"So much buzz about this place...but ya know what? I kinda loved it! I loved it enough to wait 30 minutes to sit at the bar on a Tuesday night. The food was good enough to warrant that. Besides, I brought some stellar lady friends to keep me company.My favorites? The oysters of the day were fantastic. Do some of those. Then maybe the bing bread...like a baked potato in bread. YUM. Then maybe the hand-torn noodles. Those are so nice, you might want to do them twice. (Sorry.) And the steak. Definitely do the steak. Let your server recommend a totally legit bottle of red wine. Drink it. (But you'd be remiss in not getting a cocktail to start. I was a huge fan of their version of the pisco sour.) I'd skip the tuna. While it was lovely, and I enjoyed the fresh fish with the figs, the chicken liver pate underneath (which I ordinarily love) didn't really do it for me with the fish. Service was spot on, from the lovely hostess who kindly brought us drinks (and then seamlessly transferred them to our table later) to the server who recommended a good amount of dishes and a great bottle of wine. I really loved it.Parking is decent in the area, too. Definitely worth the trek to Avondale, and worth the wait for a table."
"Is this place of the beaten path? Yes. Is it worth it? Yes. Just be prepared to have an uber lined up to take you back to the city.  I wish I would have known how amazing this place was because we probably would have made reservations to come back a second night.  The dishes were paced out very nicely, so you didn't feel like you were shoving food down your throat before the next dish came, which is how we felt and Girl and the Goat.  We started off with a half order of the bing bread, which if we lived in town, I would have ordered another one to take home.  The bread manages to be light and airy, while full of flavor. Next was the ceviche, which missed sadly missed the mark.  The quality of the fish was super fresh, but it was so overly acidic, and the dish lacked balance.  We also had the pork belly and mung bean pancake which was delicious.  The flavors were nicely balanced, and the pineapple helped to cut the fat of the pork belly. The star of the night for us was the black udon noodle with squid ink.  This dish was an umami packed flavor bomb.  I wish I could swim in a bowl of it, and eat my way out.  It was probably my favorite thing I ate while in Chicago.  We also had the lentil mandu.  The mandu itself lacked flavor, but the green curry it came with was delicious.  Last but not least was the dolsot bi bim bop.  It was delicious.  I loved that they served the tuna raw and let it cook in the bowl, otherwise it would have been overcooked.  The rice at the bottom was perfectly crispy as it should be.  I wish they would open up and NYC location, so that I could enjoy this place more often."
"I went to this place with a couple of my good friends on a Thursday night. Once inside, you can clearly note the old parachute that doubles as the restaurant's blinds and what inherently must be the restaurant's namesake. The wait was about 45minutes but the time passed by pretty quickly. The hostess brought us the drink menu to pass the time. I ordered the Colomba which I was trying for the first time. It's a white beer that hails from Corsica, France. It was very pleasant and its light notes and effervescence must have been carefully chosen as it would have been a great accompaniment to the dining menu. The inside is a bit small and seating sparse. I wouldn't say that it's the most comfortable place but it's decorated quite well and appropriately chic. I particularly appreciated the old radios that adorned one wall on the inside. It was a rather eclectic touch and flowed well with the rest of the decor. I would have been more impressed if they were rarer examples that the son of an audiophile would be able to appreciate. Once seated, we were able to order several different dishes to taste and try as we had already planned to share the plates amongst ourselves. We began with the ever popular bing bread which is a type of baked, unleavened, layered flatbread popular in Chinese cuisine. It's baked with potato, actual bacon bits and scallions and served alongside a sour cream butter. We ordered a loaf for the three of us and it shared well. I only wish they would have served us some more of that butter. It was delicious and easily an absolute staple if you're ever dining here. We also ordered some of their potato and salt cod croquettes which came served alongside a spicy plum sauce. I would have preferred the sauce to be a little bit more spicy and less tangy but the croquettes by themselves were so perfectly fried with their light yet crispy coating that I couldn't complain as I took in their interesting mix of textures.Now for dinner, we ordered the hand torn noodles which are served with spicy lamb sofrito seasoned with Szechuan peppercorn and cumin. The noodles were fine and the quality of the sofrito was easily the best I've ever had but I have to say that the Szechuan peppercorn and cumin were a bit overpowering, each by themselves respectively. The cumin I didn't mind that much if you were tasting the dish as a whole but the peppercorn was pretty distracting from an otherwise great meal. At one point, my tongue was actually a little numb. Thankfully, I was able to take care of that with a glass of château cambon circa 2011 which to date has to be the best beaujolais I have ever sampled in the price range with a very mild tannin level.Moving on, I now have to share with you my most remarkable experience of the night. I tried their berkshire pork secreto. Berkshire pork, for those of you like myself who didn't know at the time, is prized for its juiciness, flavour and tenderness. Much of this can be attributed to the fact that it's heavily marbled. The secreto, which literally means ""secret"" in Spanish, is a tender strip of pork nestled beneath a thick layer of fat on the bottom of the belly. I have to say that this is now my favorite cut after trying this plate. It's incredibly flavorful. The dish came out and the pork itself was served pink-hued alongside savoy cabbage, chewy sweet potatoes, and nam phrik. What an amazing blend of ingredients! I really must applaud the creativity and culinary genius that produced this fine example. It is mouthwatering and absolutely phenomenal. I would come back just to get this dish again for the taste alone since the serving size is too small. I have to add that this may be the best dish I have tried all year thus far. Afterwards, we ordered the hot pot which includes spicy beef marrow and crab broth, silken tofu, mussels, head on prawns, squid, and fennel. I personally didn't care much for the hot pot but thankfully my friends did so they made quick work of it. For dessert we ordered the burnt miso ice cream which comes with baked apple, pine nuts and sage. If you are looking for something sweet, I wouldn't recommend this. The cream content of the ice cream was too low to satisfy my sweet tooth but overall was an interesting spin on your typical ice cream.Overall, I would have to recommend this place for the pork secreto plate alone. It's absolutely worth trying alongside their bing bread and croquettes. Easily a great place to bring a date or good friend but maybe not so much for a larger party."
"Headed here last night with three other friends for what we hoped would be a fun and tasty dining experience. We weren't disappointed! First of all, the place has a great vibe. Some exposed brick, some fun features on the wall, and a busy open kitchen where you can see an actual Top Chef cooking your actual food. Before I break down the meal, I should say that we debated afterward whether 4 people was a good or bad way to do small plates here. Some of us felt like we got to try more, while we also mostly felt that we didn't get to eat enough of the things we ordered. To be continued...Starter:Baked potato bing bread with bacon and scallion - Wow! It tasted like a baked potato. We got a half-order and, had we not ordered six regular plates or been plain gluttonous, we would have had more. Super! (#3 item on the night.)Dishes:-Steak tartare - the horseradish kick was nice, but overall nothing special.-Pork belly and mung bean pancake - EXCELLENT. #1 fave of the night. The fried egg on top, coupled with the pineapple, made this an incredible combo of flavors. All of us would have preferred to each have our own and eat the whole thing.-Summer squash and shitake mandu (dumpling) - very good flavor. Would order again.-Salt and pepper pork ribs - Very good, and considering one of our group typically doesn't eat any food off the bone...and she was doing so quite hungrily...this was a vote in favor. Good choice.-Hand-torn noodle with spicy lamb sofrito - I loved this, but rest of group was not as excited. I loved the flavors.-Bi Bim Bop - We were told we basically ""had"" to order either the bi bim bop or the seafood hot pot, and this is the one we went with. Having never had bi bim bop before, I thought it was great. Everyone else liked it, although one said she'd had better. (Isn't that usually the case?)Dessert:Sheep's milk panna cotta with toasted coconut shavings, raspberries and maybe something else I forgot - insane. Item #2 on the night. And again, something we each wished we'd had our own.Overall, a great experience. At 7 pm on a Tuesday night, we were the last people to get seated right away before people had to wait."
This place was unique and the service was amazing. I am so glad we found such a spot in our area that we can use for special date nights!
"As a fan of Top Chef, you're always left wondering - how good are these chefs? After a dinner at Mexique (which included meeting Carlos), the answer - pretty damn good. And Parachute did not disappoint (although, I didn't get to meet Beverly Kim this time around. Oh well).Coming in on a Saturday, there was a two hour wait on tables, but the bar seating was immediate and quite spacious to be honest. The whole space is a tad on the narrow end, but it is well-decorated - standard hip & trendy. I do have to mention, the single wood-framed panel of lighting over the whole bar is real nice.For three, we ordered the oysters, bing bread, twi gim, romaine salad, cauliflower mandu, boudin noir, hand torn noodle, hot pot, and finally the coconut mochi cake to round out the meal. Each dish was incredibly delicious - so well-balanced with unique twists along the way, that often, you don't see coming. I've never been to a restaurant so keen on playing with your sense of texture in each course which made the dining experience so much more elaborate.To run through a few highlights. Bing bread - I couldn't nail it down, it felt like I was eating an Asian-inspired sandwich, but it was just this dense bread that I wanted to keep on coming. Boudin noir - this dish was so incredibly playful and delicious, as the boudin noir was in pate form (versus sausage form) while it was contrasted with the big crunch of those little corn kernels.  Hand torn noodle - was so interesting to experience the numbing sensation from the peppers without feeling the consequence of the heat, not to mention the texture play again with portions of the noodle fried till crispy. Even the dessert - the coconut mochi cake - had a play on texture with the crunch of the buckwheat. Though tucked away in Avondale, you can't pass up a restaurant like this which truly pushes you to appreciate every element of a course. I will be back."
"I was so highly disappointed in my experience here and wanted so badly to love it.  Not being from the Chicago area but wanting to check out Beverly Kim's restaurant (because I love Top Chef), I put this stop on our limited and precious food itinerary for our Chicago trip.  Being that they seem to be located in the middle of nowhere, I think the no-reservation system is a mistake (I just checked their website and it looks like they now are taking reservations; still, I wouldn't come back).  We got there to put our name down, and was told to wait 2 hours.  Yikes!  They didn't have a bar we can wait at, just a short bench for 5-6 people to sit (and it was full).  They suggested that we walk down the street to an Irish restaurant (which has a bar) and spend the next 2 hours there.  Well, there was nothing else around, it took 30 minutes to get to this neighborhood, and I still wanted to try it, so we were committed.  We had drinks at the Irish bar, coupled with fries to tide us over.  Fast forward two hours, we were seated at one of the communal tables.  The service was decent but nothing that stood out. We ordered a few dishes to share (there were 3 of us), including the kimchi pancake.  In the end, the food just wasn't good.   It was all mediocre, and highly disappointing since we waited for 2 hours for mediocre and therefore overpriced food.  I should have eaten at the Irish restaurant."
"Hubby and I were able to snag a 7pm Tuesday night reservation.  We were seated immediately upon arrival at the end of the central communal table, right next to the bar.  I liked the position since you can see down the length of the table as well as across to the bar end.  There are hooks underneath the table to hang coats and purses.Based on the other rave reviews, we had to try the Baked Potato Bing Bread.  The half order was perfect for two and enough so you wouldn't get too stuffed for the rest of the meal.  It's as good as everyone said it'd be...with or without the amazing sour cream butter on the side.Our server recommended ordering 4 main dishes for dinner, but we were more than fine with 3.  The choices are ordered from lighter to heaviest (ending with the hot pot).  Hubby had to have the Dolsot Bi Bim Bap.  I was torn between the Berkshire Pork Secreto and the Pork Belly and Mung Bean Pancake.  When we asked our server for recs, she asked what else we were ordering before making suggestions.  We ended up with the Berkshire, Bi Bim Bap, and Broccoli - a great combo!  The Berkshire was so juicy and fatty.  I liked the chewy plantains and even mistook one piece of glorious cut pork fat for a piece of plantain.  The cabbage was also delicious.  Broccoli had great texture and flavor with the anchovies and pomegranate seeds.  The Bi Bim Bap also had a great texture with the super crispy rice.  I usually don't like tripe, but the barbecued tripe was amazing!  We definitely had plenty for take home.For dessert we tried the butter cake, which was a new addition to the menu that day.  It took a few bites to figure out what was going on, but I liked the crispy crust surrounding the rich cake.  I didn't really care for the ice cream or the slivered pears on top.  Wish we went for the almond shortbread instead.Hubby enjoyed the beer on tap while I really liked my iced milk tea.  Had a kick with some spicy cardamon.Lovely dinner in a warm, very cozy (towards the end of dinner there were people standing by the bar behind me waiting for a table), and inviting space."
"I've been here I'd say four or five times already!I said this to one of the workers, that each time it gets better and better.It's a funny little story, From supporting them to kickstarter to becoming what I'd call a regular if that's even the word to use. Their menu pairs greatly, as do drinks.  Honestly a superb place, will continue to come back."
"Lots of great things to love about Parachute! Not only is the food bomb but I really dig the communal environment. Place is small but fun place to dine at. The staff is really friendly too. The only disappointment was  I came here with my friends for the first time on a Friday night. Bad move! Close to an hour wait. Really wish they used waitlist apps like Nextme to text patrons when their table's ready. Love when I can see my position in line so I can come back accordingly rather than wait at the restaurant forever :'(. Tried the bing bread,  pork belly pancake, & dolsot bi bim bap. ALL FIRE! Must order. Great atmosphere to meet new people and enjoy good food. Enjoy!"
"I feel really bad about this review because I so wanted to find a great Korean spot in Chicago and ultimately everything about the experience feel flat.  We arrived at 515 and were able to get a table but within 30 minutes the place was packed.  At that point it became way to loud to hold an easy conversation and the music blared above all.  Its a small place with retro stereo equipment on the walls. Trying to be ultra modern but falls a little flat.  Service was ok, but over extended. It was nice to see Bev delivering dishes and talking to some customers.  The pace of the meal was off, way to fast.  A new dish arrived before you were finished with the first. Small tables and big plates didn't help as the table was quickly overwhelmed.  Another annoyance was the infrequent changing of your dinner plate. With so many messes dishes, your plate quickly becomes a mess melding multiple flavors together. We only had 1 plate in 10 courses, just plain ridiculous. A small beer and cocktail selection drive you to wine.  Water is provided in a bottle, but the drinking glasses are absurdly small. They had to be about 3oz leaving you to literally refill your water after a sip. Its burdensome and annoying. All these little things can be ignored if the food is top notch, unfortunately despite some creatively, almost every dish fell flat on its face.  I have not had such an uninspiring meal in Chicago in years where there were literally so many misses.  A quick rundown of some of the worst misses, flavorless raw oysters, the seasame leaves are unique but just tempura lettuce, you didn't need so much and the soy sauce has no bourbon at all, the boudin noir is basically meat pudding which is disturbing, and the bi bim bop's fish was the most boring fish I've ever had.  The pork ribs and baked potato bread were decent.Amid this mess, however, was a transcendent dish, the caramelized cauliflower mandu.  The texture, spring colors of purple, yellow and green, and the complex flavors of sweet, sour, spicy and heat is unreal.  Please move towards more dishes like this or this place won't meet the hype and will die fast."
"One of the best and most interesting meals I've had while living in Chicago. Some of the dishes, specifically the boudin noir, are unlike anything I've ever tasted. These unique dishes are balanced out by nicely executed, straightforward plates; I could eat the hand torn noodles with a (very gentle) touch of Sichuan spice all day.The space is fairly small - there are a few tables up front, but the majority of real estate is covered by a long bar running nearly the length of the restaurant. My party of three walked in at 7:30 on a Saturday and was immediately seated at the bar, whereas seating at a table was a 2 hour wait. The bar was massive, so cramped bar seating should be no concern; I don't think I could've snagged the bi bim bop from my neighbor if I tried. Decor is minimal/modern, and is well accompanied by soft electronic jams played from a record player. The music didn't seem that loud to me, as other reviewers have complained.Service was smart and well informed. Beer and food recommendations were fantastic. Beer list is small but unique. I can't wait to go back.ORDER: Baked potato bing bread, boudin noir, hand torn noodle, cauliflower mandu, and coconut mochi cake.DON'T ORDER: I'd skip the hot pot - it certainly tastes fine, but at $36, I'd rather order two other dishes that will be more interesting."
"Note: they now take reservations!  We didn't know this so we came prepared to wait but on a sat night around 8, the wait was about fifteen minutes.I liked the decor.  Although it just seemed a bit too snug.  It wasn't overly crowded but just to get to the moving area, it was like a bit uncomfortable.  Especially with our winter coats on us.  The server was great.  Only thing was that when we asked what she recommended for wine, she just started saying names of the wine with no description.  I wish she was more knowledgable so we could actually select a wine so we just ended up telling her to surprise us. Food was good.  The only con I have is that the food wasn't piping hot like how I like... Came out a bit luke warm..."
This is an amazing restaurant! We went here for my husbands thirtieth birthday! The food and service were incredible. My husband said the oysters were the best he has ever had! Our whole experience was amazing! I am thankful they take reservations now! I couldn't imagine waiting anywhere for two hours when hungry! :)
"way. too. loud. so so so so so too loud. it was so loud at dinner last night that my throat hurts now from yelling. the mood at dinner was not as celebratory as i wanted it to be because we couldn't hear each other across the table & it was impossible to have a group conversation. my friend asked to turn the music down &, honestly, the song volume turned UP 1/2 way through the song. we thought that they misunderstood her!i ain't got nothing against loud music & i loved their playlist, but there's a time & a place for that. i wanted to hang with my girlies and celebrate & that didn't happen exactly as planned since we got tired of leaning forward, getting hair in our food, saying, ""WHAT?""the food was good to great. not sure if i'll go back because the food wasn't awesome enough to make me want to go through dinner not hearing my friends, again."
"The food tasted good, but the food was not worth its value. I could get the same tasting food, with bigger portions, at a cheaper price, but without all the fancy garnishings at another Korean restaurant. 2 stars for presentation and ambience."
"This place is an incredible korean restaurant.  Very small.  There is not one thing that I could not recommend.  The service is nice, it is a few tables, and the owner does the serving, etc.   You definitely need to try this place.  It gets expensive since the plates are smallish.    Service is over the top."
"Absolutely amazing. From the time that we walked in till the time that we left, we felt like family. Super intimate and home-ie dining room. We sat at the bar and had the pleasure of being served by the manager (Danielle) and bartender (Enoch). He paired wines with every course that were spot on and I couldn't have asked for a better spot to celebrate my birthday. We will be back soon!"
"Owing to the hearty recommendation of a chef friend and to the fact that I went to kindergarten with the celebrity chef/owner Beverly Kim, my wife and I brought our daughter and her restaurant-critic sister for an early 5pm dinner.The ambiance is casual yet hip, and the staff exceedingly friendly yet not stiff nor insincere.  The other patrons were an ecletic variety, likely reflective of the fact that Parachute is a 'destination' location bringing in folks from all walks of life and all parts of Chicago.  I imagine it is an ideal date restaurant, owing to its small size and intimate feel, yet it was casual enough for us to have our 3 yr old daughter scampering around with no nuisance to other diners.The food & drink were excellent, as per the other reviews here and the James Beard nomination which is exceedingly rare for a restaurant in its first year of operation.  We particularly loved the baked potato bing bread, the pork belly and mung bean pancake, the duck breast and pork neck.  I thought the Parachute take on the classic whiskey sour was delicious and my wife loved the homemade iced assam milk tea.If you're a fan of Korean food, you will love the Korean influence on mainstream dishes and the Western-fusion take on classic Korean foods (the mung bean pancake topped with a hen egg and pineapple is a great example).Many congratulations to the husband-wife team of Beverly & Johnny.  Very exciting to have experienced Parachute and look forward to many years of culinary success there!"
"Bread was great - reminded me of a fancier, elevated version of the buns I used to get at Korean bakeries.Pancakes were definitely sweeter than what my taste buds are used to - but it was a great Asian fusion dish. Egg was perfectly cooked on top of the pan crisp mungbean pancake.We got the seafood hot pot which had humongous prawns, squid, mussels, and soondubu (silken tofu). That was a hefty $36 but definitely worth it."
"Perhaps I was very underwhelmed due to the hype - or we might have ordered all the wrong dishes. I am always cautious when it comes to eating Asian Fusion because I tend to experience extreme misses or hits (think Fat Rice) with the food genre. We ordered the eggplant mandu (which was good and the best out of our four dishes), the pancakes (OK, I see what you are trying to do), the quail (nothing special), and the lamb noodles (complete disaster). There is a fine line with the fusion asian cuisine where (as my best friend said it perfectly), you can take what is amazing about a culture, fine tune those skills, but integrate a unique twist to it, or you can taste like a person who has just learned to cook who gets excited about 'mixing it up' with their dishes and throwing together elements that make sense but do not come together at the end. We felt that eating at this place was the latter. I apologize for being harsh - this was our experience and I would definitely be willing to try again with entirely different dishes, but whatever you do, do not order the lamb noodles, as it was salty and overwhelming to the palette in a bad way. We had to scrunch up our faces to continue eating the dish.This all being said - service was pretty good, drinks were excellent, and great ambiance/environment."
"Came back 10 days later. Tried more good food - oysters again, bing bread (crunchy crust, magnificent inside), pork belly pancake, steak with a miso blue cheese sauce, squash with a curry Colombo type sauce. Again, all amazing. I left feeling like I'd been fed magic. I felt healthy and alive. Not overfed or over served. Just relaxed. H/T to the bartender Matty. We sat next to his dad at the bar. The guy knows his pairings. Tried a light sparking Beaujolais that was delicious.  We will be back!"
"My birthday dinner here was really fantastic. My cousins and I arrived at 5:30PM on a Sat, just in time to get a table for 4 without having to wait. I would recommend coming before 6PM if you hate waiting because after 6, it was packed. The place is small and it gets loud, though I didn't think the noise level was too bad during my our dinner. While the menu doesn't specify what is intended as a first-second-third course, it seems to flow from smallest to largest. The items in the middle of the menu is what needs a little more clarification because you don't know the portion sizes (they are small). Our server suggested we order about 2-3 items per person. I think 2 items per person is enough food, unless you are really hungry. We ordered:*Starters*-Baked potato bing bread. It says baked because of the bacon, it feels slightly greasy and fried. Simple but good.-Oysters were incredibly fresh and bright. I didn't try the soju granita because it wasn't necessary on that night, the oysters were that good.-Crispy sesame leaves. I'm torn on this because the leaves were fried perfectly but there was nothing else. And only 4 leaves seemed a tad small. Maybe it's because I know so many Korean families who have sesame leaves in their backyards and just give them away.*Second Course*-Albacore confit. The tuna was mild and I couldn't taste the liver puree at all. The fig paired nicely with the fish and it was better than anticipated. -Boudin Noir. This was one of my favorites. I thought it would be served as a sausage but it came as a pate. It was smooth but they added popcorn bits, apple, and some vinegar to cut through the richness of the blood and add texture. It would've been a fun play on boudin if they added rice crispies instead of popcorn but either way, this dish was executed perfectly.-Pork belly and mung bean cake. I would have to say this was a miss. First, it was so tiny. All the ingredients just tasted muddled or were lost completely. The pineapple was the only flavor I could clearly identify.*Main*-Ribs. The ribs were everyone's favorite. You should order them, without a doubt. The glaze was a bit sweet, a bit spicy and had a subtle tang from the yuzu in the glaze.  -Butchers steak. I'm not sure what exactly butchers steak is but based on the look of it, I would say it's equivalent to a hanger steak. It was served a little less than medium rare and for this type of cut, the meat was too soft. We sent it back and requested medium and it was spot on at med temp. The miso-blue cheese was interesting and something worth exploring. Both bring their own kind of funk to a dish and combined it worked well with beef. Overall, I liked Parachute. While there were some misses, the good dishes were very good. Service was excellent. Our server was knowledgeable and seemed to know how often to come around. My only real gripe is not being told our table would be used as a communal table at some point of the evening. There were four of us and they sat us at the only available table, which happened to have six seats. In the middle of dinner, the hostess approached our table and said, ""At this time, your table turns into a communal table."" Suddenly we have this couple sitting next to us who are clearly not comfortable with the arrangement and it changed the mood of our evening from relaxed and fun to hushed and guarded. I understand people are waiting be seated but this moment was so awkward for everyone that I hope they reconsider and do away with this policy."
"We wanted so much to like Parachute, after seeing their menu online and reading the review. My husband saw an advertisement for the restaurant (particularly their steak bi bim bop) in the back of a taxi and was so excited to try this dish. Well, we get to the restaurant and the menu has changed to albacore. Fine, but he's allergic to seafood, so now that was out. Also, things that seemingly should have been safe for him to eat (boudin noir) had shrimp paste or oyster sauce as a garnish. When asked if we could just leave this garnish off, the waitress said, ""The kitchen's not going to do that... But you can just eat around it!"" Other than this, service was great, water cups were always filled and she was knowledgable about the menu. The beef tartare (with Chinese mustard) was light on any flavor except straight up mustard. It was unpalatable. The short ribs were fantastic though, as well as the sesame leaves and the baked potato bread. The bi bim bop was just ok. One thing we didn't know before we came is that the menu is small plates meant for sharing. The waitress suggested (for a party of four) that we order four appetizers and six small plates. Each menu item was between $10 and $25, but mostly in the $17 to $20 range. It's not that we aren't willing to pay for a nice meal, we were just unprepared going in."
"When there's a lot of expectation, there is room for more disappointment. We were excited to try parachute and with good reviews though out, I felt lackluster when I left. The cuisine is best described as Korean inspired because to say its true Korean would be untrue mainly because the outstanding flavor that is present in traditional Korean cuisine is lacking. The space is cute, well done for the neighborhood. The service was personable although I wasn't able to hear most of the food descriptions because of the loudness in the space. Overall I was most disappointed in the lack in depth of flavor. The menu options tried really hard to have many layers of flavor but most of the time, the flavors never married well. Several of the dishes had an overwhelming amount of acid -- too sour.What we liked:- lemon fish: the only outstanding fish of the night. The fish was perfect. The accompaniments were great. The dashi broth was a bit too acidic but for this fish it worked. What was just so-so:- croquets: they were small. The filling not reminiscent of what croquets should be-- potatoey! The sauce unremarkable- pork belly pancake: couldn't really decifer the mung bean texture, flavors were sour but lacked salt. Overall I wanted more Korean flavor coming through- bibimbap: someone recommended I try this bc it was their fav bibimbap ever. Again really wanted strong aggressive Korean flavor to shine through but just lacked flavor! The albacore was delicious but poorly used in this course because when you mix everything, the albacore cooks through and you lose the wonderful raw texture. - pork ribs: a confusing dish for me bc I expected sticky flavorful ribs. Instead they were nicely smoked by dry flavorless ribs. Not Korean inspired at allKinda disappointed. I wanted to experience Beverly's Korean background and awesome flavors but our experience fell short."
"Really great experience. SERVICE: very good, nice and attentiveATMOSPHERE: simple with an East Village vibeTHE WAIT: Thursday night, 8:30 Oct 30- empty tables. We didn't wait at all.FOOD: sharing plates, Korean spin on most things. SNACKS (from best to lesser)1. Oysters: really liked the soju granita (I realize this is mostly picking fresh oysters)2. Bing Bread; interesting in a really good way3. House pickles: delicious kimchi that had a fresh taste, cucumbers were good, watermelon radish was meh 4. Potato and Cod croquettes5. Grilled carrots: mehLARGER PLATES (from best to lesser)1. Hand-torn noodle/lamb sofrito: wow2. Ribs: very, very good3. Pork belly/bean pancake: good4. Cauliflower Mandu: disappointingDolsot Bi Bim Bop: the version they had on my visit had tripe in it. I'm normally adventurous, but have my limits, so no review"
"I couldn't be more excited to have this new and delicious restaurant in Avondale! I wouldn't have spotted it without the help of the internet, as it has a small, understated look on the outside and a homey look on the inside, complete with cookbooks on a shelf behind the bar. The staff was incredibly welcoming from the beginning but what really stood out, as it should in any great restaurant, was the food. Every bite we put in our mouths was absolutely delicious, starting with the house made pickles and kimchi. I'm a sucker for pickles but you don't have to be a sucker to enjoy these pickles. We also ate:-bing bread with sour cream butter, which I now want to put on everything-fried sesame leaves, crispy and crunchy-salt and pepper pork ribs which were the perfect balance of sweet and smoky with some sorrel and shiso for a pop of freshness-hand torn noodles with lamb sofrito, it looks like a measly portion but you have to eat it slowly because the flavors are bold and worth savoring-black sesame tea cake with blueberry everything, a dessert worth orderingFrom what I hear, the menu changes all the time but I'm guessing that only makes everything better. For those who might complain about the price, please walk down the street to Honey Butter Fried Chicken which has a different set of delicious foods at a lower price point. My boyfriend and I came out of our amazing dinner at Parachute surprised that this unbelievably tasty meal cost less than comparable date nights."
"No need for a soft landing, Parachute hits hard with bold, exciting flavors that make it easily one of the most exciting new restaurants to hit the already well-stocked Chicago food scene in a long time. Playfully transitioning from French bistro classics with a Korean twist to Korean classics with a French twist, Parachute showcases the cooking of a husband and wife chef team cooking at a level far beyond their years and way above their pay grade. The first wave of snacks cemented the theme with malpeque oysters dressed with a soju granita, the brininess of the oysters redoubled with the soy, the perfectly cold oyster made colder by the granita, like drinking a delicate sip of pure ocean. The English peas served with lemongrass salt in the style of edamame were delicate and addictive like popcorn, necessitating a second order.   In quick succession, the potato and nettle croquettes with spicy plum sauce (smooth and earthy with a kick of spice), house pickles (delicately balanced and each entirely different), and baked potato bing bread with bacon, scallion, and sour cream butter (is further description required?) kept our mouths happily cross-crossing the globe. And that was just the snacks. Working our way through most of the menu, stand outs included the kampachi ceviche with green strawberries, sesame salad, and fennel: the buttery fish foiled by the slight astringency of the strawberries, accentedby the anise hints of fennel; the pork belly and mung bean pancake, the slight smokiness of the pork belly rounded out with kimchi, a hen egg, and pineapple; the roasted asparagus and shiitake mandu, which in the middle of the meal, long after we could have been sated, brought the table to a focused silence with its inspired sauce of lebneh and almonds. But the cascade of flavors reached its climax at the hot pot, a deep and complex combination of spicy crab broth, wild gulf shrimp, cherry stone clams, black radish, and crown daisy. The broth invoked the essence of shellfish, offset by bitter tastes of crown daisy and perfectly cooked, sweet head-on shrimp. Yet, if there is anything that could possibly overshadow the food at Parachute, it's the remarkable warmth of every member of the staff, from the back of the house to the front. These are dedicated people, experienced, with the kind of humility and authenticity that you would not expect from one of the most exciting new restaurants in the city. The only thing that doesn't make sense at Parachute is it's name. This is not a restaurant that is gradually falling. It's rising. Fast."
"When it comes to Korean food, I'm a bit of a traditionalist. I like bulgogi burritos and such things, but I prefer old favorites like dukbokki and yukaejang. Parachute, however, is so innovative that one visit has turned me into a rabid fan. Beverly Kim has placed pineapple and a hen egg on top of bindaeduk (a mung bean pancake). The combination of the the textures and the flavors reflects sheer genius. Every morsel of every dish we ordered was, in fact, superb, and the service was outstanding. I highly (HIGHLY) recommend Parachute. I truly experienced one of the best meals of my life at this outstanding restaurant."
"My boyfriend brought me here for a Friday date because he read something about Parachute being a new up and coming restaurant in Chicago. We are also both fans of Top Chef, so we wanted to check this place out. When we got there, we had to wait about half an hour to be seated, but I kind of expected that so it wasn't a big deal. When we did get seated we ordered the Spicy Beef Marrow and Crab Broth Hot Pot. It was $36, but totally worth it because it's a HUGE portion. My boyfriend and I didn't finish it and the only other thing we ordered was an appetizer. I am not really a big eater, and both of us were impressed with how much I ate that night because it was so good. Looking forward to going back and trying other items on the menu!Taste: 10/10Portion Size: 10/10Ambience: 8/10Service: 8/10"
"I know the cuisine is a bit different than Fat Rice, but to me it seemed like a (far) less satisfying version of Fat Rice.My main complaint is that the portions were too small, too reliant on carbs, and too lacking in protein. I found the small plates all to be pretty good, but was disappointed in the larger plates. We shared all of our plates 4 ways, but I found the portions too small for this. Even of the biggest dishes, no one got more than a few bites. I would recommend sharing the dishes 2 ways at most, and even then, there's just not enough protein served up.First we got the 2 ""specialties,"" the boudin noir and the pork belly pancake. The boudin was great but that pancake was mushy and insipid, and none of us could find the pork belly that was supposedly in it. We then had the black udon noodle, which was super delicious, but again a small portion, I had maybe 3 bites of noodle, and zero bites of the squid that was part of the dish. Next we had striped black bass, which was disappointing. Tiny portion, not very fresh tasting, sort of forgettable. Last were the two biggest disappointments, almost entirely due to the portion size: the bi bim bop and the beef hot pot. The bi bim bop was tasty but not big enough for $22. I was comparing it mentally to bi bim bop that I had just a few weeks earlier at a tiny restaurant in Bucktown called The Bento Box, which was much bigger, fresher tasting, and loaded with ingredients, for $20. So the Parachute one didn't live up to that, and was lacking in the variety of veggies and other ingredients compared to other bi bim bop I've had. Lastly, the hot pot was the most disappointing. For a ""beef"" hot pot at $38, it had less than 2 oz of beef. Probably closer to 1 oz, all 4 of us agreed on that, because we each had about 1 bite of it. And it was overboiled too. The broth was fantastic, but the hot pot was even low on noodles. At the end we had a massive bowl of broth left and nothing to eat it with. Not ideal.Most likely will not be back at these prices. Too many good places to try out, too many better places to return to."
Amazing. That is all. Just go. I'm not going to ruin the surprise by posting about every dish I tried there in detail. (*whispers:* I tried most of them)Just go. Seriously. Trust in Danielle. Trust in the beverage list. Each one is ridick yummers.
"Great dinner!  The food was excellent.  Korean influences throughout.  We had the pickle relishes, bing bread, and mung bean pancake to start, pork secreto and duck for entrees.  Great presentations with interesting elements in each dish.  Drinks were light pours but decent prices and interesting selection.The decor was like the winner of a dumpster dive competition (in a good way).  Funky second hand elements and DIY fixes does in elegant ways.  I caught myself staring around the space noticing new things throughout the meal.Service was great.  Understated but warm; the staff really seemed to be having fun.Highly recommend.  Make reservations if you can."
"Haven't been this excited about food for quite a while! Excellent Korean food with a modern twist. Chef Kim knows what she's doing! We got the bing bread (to-die-for), hand-torn noodles & bibimbap. The noodles had great texture and though I'm usually not a big cumin fan, I gobbled this up without complaints. The bibimbap is lighter than traditional beef version as it came with super-fresh escolar and lettuce. It was sauced just right so every grain of rice had the right amount of the smoky spiky sauce. Also tried the pat bing su which was such an exciting mix of flavors and textures I didn't want to share! Highly recommended!"
"We were thrilled when a new restaurant opened near our home, as finer dining opportunities are a little scarce near Elston and Kimball Aves. and Parachute does not disappoint. Curated by a cooking show winner (I forget which one), Parachute serves up thoughtful and delicious food at a price that is a little high for the neighborhood but in line with the excellent food they serve made of locally sourced ingredients. Parachute defines itself as Korean inspired and that is true but hardly limiting or overwhelming - in short, the food is excellent, thoughtfully prepared and exquisitely presented. Eating at Parachute is like going to an art museum, or a play.... you go to expose yourself to new thoughts and ideas and learn about yourself and the world. However, I am not alone in this opinion which means that unless you want to eat at 5:00, you will be waiting weeks to get the standard table for four at 7:00 on a Saturday night. Additionally, like many restaurants these days, Parachute's décor features a certain number of hard surfaces which means that it can be a loud room- although tight seating arrangements usually allow you to hear everyone in your party. It should be noted that the music is at the perfect level. Overall, the services is excellent. The wait staff is the perfect amount of attentive but not overbearing and they know their menu - take their recommendations and don't be surprised if your food rolls out in a different order than you thought - they really know best on how to sequence the different dishes. I would also recommend checking out their website - it provides an accurate description of both the atmosphere and their menu. Parachute is a huge asset to the neighborhood and I can only hope that they stay around for a while at least. It's quickly becoming one of my favorites!"
"I had such a great time tonight! The entire menu piqued my interest right away. The dishes all sounded so interesting and different. Everything we ordered was really tasty. Some of my favorites were- Baked Potato, Bacon Bread- Cristy Sesame Leaves - really simple and delicate- Pork Belly and Mung Bean Pancake - YUM- Hot Pot - We wanted to get a doggy bag for that broth. - Chocolate pudding, malted milk dessert - A perfect way to close out the meal. The Pat Bing Su, shaved ice dessert was really good too.  A nice summer dessert.It always a good sign when you leave a restaurant knowing you want to be back to make sure you get to the rest of the dishes on the menu. The drinks, music and decor make this a great place for a fun, casual dinner with good company. Bonus: Parking is free and plentiful in that area. Oh! and we didn't order it but we saw the group next to us order a kid's menu item and it came out in this adorable tray."
"You guys, what are you even doing sitting at home? You should be at Parachute right freaking now.THE FOOD:We started with a delicious bottle of Chardonnay and the pickled snacks. The pickles were everything you want them to be: salty, sour, crunchy, spicy, and abundant. At our server Danielle's recommendation, we moved on to the Bi Bim Bop. It was INCREDIBLE. Perfectly cooked short rib, crunchy kale, spicy ramps, and a creamy duck egg in the middle. We moved on to a pork and fish, both fabulous.THE AMBIANCE:When the Bi Bim Bop was delivered to our table, an older Korean lady sitting next to us in communal seating dashed over and mixed it ""properly"" for my caucasian dining partner and I. We later found out that she was the chef's mother! Full disclosure: my parents own a restaurant as well, so seeing a family working to create something beautiful together really melts my heart. It's little things like that that make a restaurant experience truly special to me. Parachute is both elegant and charming, which given the cuisine and the Avondale neighborhood that it sits in, feels authentic and comfortable. THE SHADE:Another yelper mentioned that it was loud and that he was bothered that there was a turntable (?!?). Uh YEAH DUDE. It's a hip new restaurant with the cutest speaker shelves playing trip-hop and soul. IT'S GREAT. Maybe you and your allergies should just get a Lean Cuisine and watch Matlock, YA BASICS. Bye Felicia!"
"Dined here last Saturday and everything was solid, but ultimately we left wanting/expecting much more.The highlight of the meal was the bread appetizer, which, although very tasty (imagine loaded baked potato infused bread), just made the rest of the meal seem less impressive. Tried the house pickles dish afterwards which offered an assortment of veggies going through varying levels of fermentation. The house made ""kimchi"" had to be the biggest disappointment of the bunch, which was quite surprising given the chef's background. Perhaps my palette has been wrecked by consuming too many mason jars full of the dankest cabbage from Joong Boo market, but what we had at Parachute isn't close to what I consider good kimchi. Not enough salt/flavor, not enough kick, just overall watered down to an unrecognizable level.Moved on to the pork belly-mung bean pancake which was ok, but again, it didn't quite click to make the dish a standout. Had inconsistencies in term of ratio of pork to breading, and the mung bean didn't add any unique or interesting dynamic to the dish. I've tried plenty of equal or superior permutations of the same concept.Ended with the monkfish and cheescake custard. If you can't guess what I'm going to say here, shame on you and your self-diagnosed ADD. The fish was cooked well but i was expecting more flavor out of the gochujang sauce. Honestly, it simply tasted like slightly spicy fish with bean sprouts on top, and the portion was on the smaller side for $21.  I will say the hot pot looked quite tasty, so we would return to give that a go. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the service. for being so new we had no issues with ordering and timing of the dishes, and every staff member who assisted us was friendly and attentive.We'll return at some point to try some other entrees and hopefully the kimchi situation will be addressed by then (seriously, if they serve the asian market kimchi and pass it off as their own, no one will be the wiser, and it will instantly improve their standing in my eyes).  In summary, I'd give the food 2-2.5 stars and the service bumps it up to a 3."
"Small plates, they suggested four people to order a few snacks to start followed by 5-7 plates.  We also had 20 oysters. Could have just eaten those all night. They were terrific. Food was fine, can't remember exactly what we had, nothing to memorable. A few dishes tasted very similar. Bread was good. After reading all the reviews we were expecting to be blown away and unfortunately we were not. We had a nice night but I doubt we will return."
"Delicious, Korean-inspired food. Wonderful dining experience.Ambiance - Chill, casual, lively around 6 pm on a Saturday night. There are wooden tables with benches and chairs. A long wooden communal table sits in the middle of the restaurant. Very kid-friendly.Service - Excellent. Very attentive, friendly, and conscientious. Asked if we had any food allergies and suggested how we should order. Our glasses of water were always full.Food - Excellent. We ordered:-Half order of the bacon bread-Pork belly and mung bean pancake-Little gem lettuce salad-Dolsot bibimbop-Monkfish roasted in gochujang-Slow cooked chicken-Pat bing su (cucumber ice with ice cream)All the dishes were flavorful and delightful.Our toddler ordered udon from the kid's menu. It wasn't really udon but flat, wide noodles. It was good, though our toddler seemed enamored with the bacon bread.Extra bonus - We found free street parking only a few feet from the restaurant entrance.In sum: a fantastic restaurant with great food, great service, and great ambiance."
"Went on a Friday at eight and was seated right away. Unfortunately its a bit loud but that was later appreciated bc we were sitting between two very annoying groups, but I digress. Started w the oysters and whatever the condiment that it come with was perfect. Then has the veal tartar and that was great bc i could have eaten another plate! Next was swordfish which was also very good. The we ordered the seafood bi bim bop. That was not for me, i like meat version much better so now i know that! We closed out w another round of oysters which made up for the bi bim bop. All in all it was a great exp and I will def be back!"
"I have moved on and traded up.Sometimes when a relationship ends, you feel a little lost until serendipity intervenes and you find that you are happier than you were before.I was feeling a little broken hearted when Bill Kim closed the Avondale location if Urban Belly and moved to the West Loop.  Enter Beverly Kim and Johnny Clark with Parachute and now Avondale has another winner.Although it is not common to charge for bread in the States, the $4 spent on the bacon bread has been my best investment this year.Their take on Be Bim Bop is served in a ceramic bowl which makes the rice crispy as it sits.  Fantastic.The room is vibrant, energetic and communal.  If you want the music low, go to Grandpa's country club.If the romantic notion of opening up a restaurant and watching the easy money roll in ever enters your mind, please take 10 minutes to read the Chicago Tribune article on the personal sacrifices and risks that these two folks have made to open this place.  articles.chicagotribune.…"
"The very best execution, application and presentation of Korean food I've ever experienced. The ambiance was energetic and stylish.  Comfortable seating with a variety of options from traditional tables to bar and communal high table seating.  The high table seating was an extension of the bar.  We only had some of the more popular dishes but the standouts were the oysters, house pickles, crispy sesame leaves, and pork belly pancake.  The house specialty cocktails were also outstanding and a must have.  We'll definitely be back to try some of the other dishes like the cold buckwheat noodles, hand torn noodle, pork ribs, and the dolsot bi bim bop."
"We were really excited to try Parachute.  My wife had taken folks to Aria many times when Beverly was there for work events and always loved the food.  And the food at Parachute is good.  Sometimes a little messy both in flavors and in physical distribution of food on plates intended for sharing.  The potato bread was very good but a little odd for a nominally Korean restaurant.  Another surprise was the  well done desserts, not too sweet with well balanced flavors.  Service overall was responsive.  The downside was the 1.5 hour wait for a table, combined with seeing folks who arrived after us being seated before us.  Even after that amount of time, we ended up sharing a table.  The decor/speaker set up is interesting, but the music volume makes hearing waitstaff and other people at your table nearly impossible.  The space overall is nicely done but a little gloomy.  A suggestion, people are coming for the food, we're not out clubbing.  The music selection is great, but turn it the f*ck down so we can hear the staff and each other."
"One of my favorite eating experiences!  Where do I start?  The bread is amazing...baked with potatoes, scallions, bacon, and sour cream butter.  It is something that I could just eat as a meal all by itself.  Some other stand out dishes are the noodles with lamb, the udon with clams, and dolsot bi bim bop.  The bi bim bop is made with an amazing short rib with foie gras dressing...YUM!  The pork belly and mung bean pancake is also amazing.  For main courses...I love the Monkfish and slow roasted chicken. I almost forgot, they also have an amazing drink program and offer many wonderful choices. Bottom line...We love this restaurant.  Don't pass up an opportunity to eat here!"
"Our visit here was extremely disappointing. It started when we arrived..I made a reservation for 730 on a Friday night. We arrived promptly at 730 and checked in. We were immediately seated.. at the bar! What's the point of having a reservation just to sit at the bar?? And this isn't a 'chef's table'.. just the bar. And it was EXTREMELY hot there.  I saw one air conditioner unit in the whole place; a small wall mounted unit that, as I know from experience, doesn't do a very good job on an average size room with a few people, yet alone a 40+ seat dining area.While the waiter/bartender was nice enough, the level of service and attentiveness was mediocre at best.  We ordered wine and our courses. We started with the bing bread and sesame leaves.  Bing bread was tasty, but nothing extraordinary.  It was a bit greasy.  Sesame leaves were tasty, but also a bit greasy.  These are lightly battered and flash fried (like tempura). Nothing outstanding but tasty.  Next we had the kampachi, which is a dish of raw fish with water chestnuts, and seasoning.  This was pretty blah.. nothing exciting about this dish.  Our next plate was the dukbokki; beef with leaves and rice cakes.  This was very disappointing.  The dish was 70% rice cakes, 20% leaves and maybe 5% mushrooms and 5% beef.  VERY sparse on the beef.. the beef and mushrooms that were there was very good, but there wasn't enough of it to call a beef dish (I'll post a pic later of the rice cakes that weren't eaten to give you an idea).  Our last dish was the halibut.  This was actually very good.  Well cooked, nicely seasoned and presented well.  The fried kelp that was with it was not tasty at all, but the fish was really good.We really wanted to like this place.  We both thought we had read where it won a James Beard award.. we are now certain that we are mistaken (unless it was for design or atmosphere.. definitely not for the food).Bottom line.. for $100 for 2 people, you can do so much better.  We ended up having to go somewhere for a 2nd dinner immediately after, as we were both still hungry!"
"Had an amazing time at parachute. Beer and wine pairings were unbelievable, and everyone makes you feel so welcome!Oysters from Virginia with shoju granita were amazing. Ordered the pickles, which came out in a generous trio, and nibbled on them all night. Ate so much and loved it all! Steak tartare with sunchokes and artichokes, boudin noir which was light and fascinating, an order of the incredible, decadent summer squash mandu, the lamb sofrito with hand torn noodles, and a pork belly pancake which I can't even describe adequately. Oh. And the bing bread. Holy moly, get the bing bread.All so good, and I just had a really fun time. Can't wait to go back."
This is our favorite dinner spot in Chicago! We just moved out of state and miss it! The food is wonderful. The first time we went there we said it was the best meal we had had in 6 years of living in Chicago. The second time we went back it was even better!! Loved everything we tried!!!
"Great food but the music is too loud, hardly impossible to have any kind of conversation. What a shame as it could really be a special place."
"The food was delicious. Service was efficient and prompt. Nice vibe. I would probably have given this restaurant 5 stars, however the lack of vegetarian options and the fact that they weren't able to work with us to accommodate the vegetarian at our table."
